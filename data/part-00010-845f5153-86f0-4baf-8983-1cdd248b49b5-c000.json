{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01602v1\", \"title\": \"Comment Staytime Prediction with LLM-enhanced Comment Understanding\", \"summary\": \"In modern online streaming platforms, the comments section plays a critical\\nrole in enhancing the overall user experience. Understanding user behavior\\nwithin the comments section is essential for comprehensive user interest\\nmodeling. A key factor of user engagement is staytime, which refers to the\\namount of time that users browse and post comments. Existing watchtime\\nprediction methods struggle to adapt to staytime prediction, overlooking\\ninteractions with individual comments and their interrelation. In this paper,\\nwe present a micro-video recommendation dataset with video comments (named as\\nKuaiComt) which is collected from Kuaishou platform. correspondingly, we\\npropose a practical framework for comment staytime prediction with LLM-enhanced\\nComment Understanding (LCU). Our framework leverages the strong text\\ncomprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to understand\\ntextual information of comments, while also incorporating fine-grained comment\\nranking signals as auxiliary tasks. The framework is two-staged: first, the LLM\\nis fine-tuned using domain-specific tasks to bridge the video and the comments;\\nsecond, we incorporate the LLM outputs into the prediction model and design two\\ncomment ranking auxiliary tasks to better understand user preference. Extensive\\noffline experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, showing\\nsignificant improvements on the task of comment staytime prediction.\\nAdditionally, online A/B testing further validates the practical benefits on\\nindustrial scenario. Our dataset KuaiComt\\n(https://github.com/lyingCS/KuaiComt.github.io) and code for LCU\\n(https://github.com/lyingCS/LCU) are fully released.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:09:18Z\"}"}
