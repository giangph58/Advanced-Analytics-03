Unlike qubits, which extract work by simply expanding or\\nshrinking a single energy gap, qutrits allow multiple energy gaps to be\\nadjusted independently, enabling more versatile work extraction in the quantum\\nOtto cycle. We derive a general positive work condition in terms of the\\neffective temperature that each pair of energy levels perceives. Moreover, we\\ndiscuss additional subtleties that are absent when using a qubit, such as the\\ngeneration of coherence terms in the density matrix due to interactions.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T07:38:58Z\"}"}
