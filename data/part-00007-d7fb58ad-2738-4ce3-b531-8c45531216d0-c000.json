{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06249v1\", \"title\": \"Electronic Structure Guided Inverse Design Using Generative Models\", \"summary\": \"The electronic structure of a material fundamentally determines its\\nunderlying physical, and by extension, its functional properties. Consequently,\\nthe ability to identify or generate materials with desired electronic\\nproperties would enable the design of tailored functional materials.\\nTraditional approaches relying on human intuition or exhaustive computational\\nscreening of known materials remain inefficient and resource-prohibitive for\\nthis task. Here, we introduce DOSMatGen, the first instance of a machine\\nlearning method which generates crystal structures that match a given desired\\nelectronic density of states. DOSMatGen is an E(3)-equivariant joint diffusion\\nframework, and utilizes classifier-free guidance to accurately condition the\\ngenerated materials on the density of states. Our experiments find this\\napproach can successfully yield materials which are both stable and match\\nclosely with the desired density of states. Furthermore, this method is highly\\nflexible and allows for finely controlled generation which can target specific\\ntemplates or even individual sites within a material. This method enables a\\nmore physics-driven approach to designing new materials for applications\\nincluding catalysts, photovoltaics, and superconductors.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T17:54:49Z\"}"}
