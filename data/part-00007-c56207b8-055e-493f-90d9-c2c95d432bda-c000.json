We are more interested in the positive characteristic case due to our\\noriginal purpose.\\n  (i) For an endomorphism of a projective variety, the return set of a dense\\norbit into a curve is finite if any cohomological Lyapunov exponent of any\\niteration is not an integer.\\n  (ii) Let $f\\\\times g:X\\\\times C\\\\rightarrow X\\\\times C$ be an endomorphism in\\nwhich $f$ and $g$ are endomorphisms of a projective variety $X$ and a curve\\n$C$, respectively. If the degree of $g$ is greater than the first dynamical\\ndegree of $f$, then the return sets of the system $(X\\\\times C,f\\\\times g)$ have\\nthe same form as the return sets of the system $(X,f)$.\\n  Using the second result, we deal with the case of split endomorphisms of\\nproducts of curves, for which the degrees of the factors are pairwise distinct.\\n  In the cases that the height argument cannot be applied, we find examples\\nwhich show that the return set can be very complicated -- more complicated than\\nexperts once imagine -- even for endomorphisms of tori of zero entropy.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS,math.AG,math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T10:04:14Z\"}"}
