{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02598v1\", \"title\": \"Graphs are everywhere -- Psst! In Music Recommendation too\", \"summary\": \"In recent years, graphs have gained prominence across various domains,\\nespecially in recommendation systems. Within the realm of music recommendation,\\ngraphs play a crucial role in enhancing genre-based recommendations by\\nintegrating Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) with advanced graph\\nembeddings. This study explores the efficacy of Graph Convolutional Networks\\n(GCN), GraphSAGE, and Graph Transformer (GT) models in learning embeddings that\\neffectively capture intricate relationships between music items and genres\\nrepresented within graph structures. Through comprehensive empirical\\nevaluations on diverse real-world music datasets, our findings consistently\\ndemonstrate that these graph-based approaches outperform traditional methods\\nthat rely solely on MFCC features or collaborative filtering techniques.\\nSpecifically, the graph-enhanced models achieve notably higher accuracy in\\npredicting genre-specific preferences and offering relevant music suggestions\\nto users. These results underscore the effectiveness of utilizing graph\\nembeddings to enrich feature representations and exploit latent associations\\nwithin music data, thereby illustrating their potential to advance the\\ncapabilities of personalized and context-aware music recommendation systems.\\nKeywords: graphs, recommendation systems, neural networks, MFCC\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:00:52Z\"}"}
