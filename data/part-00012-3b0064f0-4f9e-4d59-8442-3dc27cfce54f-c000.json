{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06041v1\", \"title\": \"Exchange-Biased multi-ring Planar Hall Magnetoresistive Sensors with nT\\n  resolution in Non-Shielded Environments\", \"summary\": \"Planar Hall magnetoresistive sensors (PHMR) are promising candidates for\\nvarious magnetic sensing applications due to their high sensitivity, low power\\nconsumption, and compatibility with integrated circuit technology. However,\\ntheir performance is often limited by inherent noise sources, impacting their\\nresolution and overall sensitivity. Here the effect of three bilayer structures\\nNiFe(10 nm)/IrMn(10 nm), NiFe(30 nm)/IrMn(10 nm), and NiFe(30 nm)/IrMn(20 nm)\\non noise levels is investigated at low-frequency (DC - 25 Hz). This study\\nincludes a detailed investigation on the optimization process and noise\\ncharacteristics of multiring PHMR sensors, focusing on identifying and\\nquantifying the dominant noise sources. The experimental measurements are\\ncomplemented by a theoretical analysis of noise sources including thermal\\nnoise, 1/f noise, intermixing and environmental noise. The best magnetic\\nresolution is observed for the NiFe(30 nm)/IrMn(10 nm) structure, which\\nachieves a detectivity below 1.5 nT/sqrt(Hz) at 10 Hz in a non-shielded\\nenvironment at room temperature. In addition, a substantial improvement in\\nsensitivity is observed by annealing the sensors at 250 deg C for 1 hour. The\\nfindings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of noise behavior\\nin PHMR sensors, paving the way for developing strategies to improve their\\nperformance for demanding sensing applications at low frequencies.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:41:58Z\"}"}
