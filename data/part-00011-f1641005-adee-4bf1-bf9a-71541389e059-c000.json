{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05947v1\", \"title\": \"Multi-modal strain mapping of steel crack tips with micrometer spatial\\n  resolution\", \"summary\": \"Due to their superior fatigue strength, martensitic steels are the material\\nof choice for high cyclic loading applications such as coil springs. However,\\ncrack propagation is influenced by residual stresses and their interaction is\\npoorly understood. In fact, Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics predicts\\nun-physical singularities in the strain around the crack tip. In this study, we\\nhave combined synchrotron-based x-ray diffraction, x-ray fluorescence, and\\noptical microscopy to map the factual strain fields around crack tips with\\nmicrometer spatial resolution. X-ray fluorescence and optical images were\\nco-registered to locate the crack in the x-ray diffraction maps. Observed\\ncrystal recovery close to cracks confirmed that the diffraction signal\\noriginates at least in parts from the cracks. The retrieved local strain field\\naround the crack was further improved by averaging information over carefully\\nselected diffraction peaks. This procedure provided strain maps around crack\\ntips with a spatial resolution of about 1 micro meter and enabled a prediction\\nof further crack growth.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T11:59:29Z\"}"}
