A key assumption of\\nthis framework is to neglect anisotropic perturbations on large scales. We show\\nthat neglecting the anisotropic sector in the momentum constraint corresponds\\nto discarding the non-adiabatic mode of scalar-field perturbations at large\\nscales. Consequently, the Hamilton-Jacobi approach cannot be used to describe\\nthe evolution of large-scale perturbations during inflation beyond slow roll,\\nwhen non-adiabatic fluctuations play an important role on super-Hubble scales\\ndue to the absence of an attractor trajectory. As an example, we analyse the\\ncase of cosmological perturbations during a phase of ultra-slow-roll inflation.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T11:52:44Z\"}"}
