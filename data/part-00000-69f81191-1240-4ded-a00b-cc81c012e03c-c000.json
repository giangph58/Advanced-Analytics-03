This short manifesto proposes a\\nradical alternative: a system in which the author is sovereign of their\\nintellectual domain. It presents seven ethical principles that challenge\\nprevailing assumptions about open access, copyright ownership, and the public\\ndomain - arguing that voluntary, negotiated consent must replace coercive\\nnorms. The text exposes how weakened authorship fuels structural exploitation.\\nIn place of reactive solutions, it calls for a new ethic of authorship rooted\\nin consent, dignity, and contractual fairness.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T03:12:42Z\"}"}
