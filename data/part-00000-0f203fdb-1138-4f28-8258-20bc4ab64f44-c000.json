{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23719v1\", \"title\": \"Compact orbital-angular-momentum multiplexing via laser-written glass\\n  chips\", \"summary\": \"Orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes have emerged as a promising solution for\\nenhancing the capacity of optical multiplexing systems, leveraging their\\ntheoretically unbounded set of orthogonal spatial modes. However, the\\ngeneration and detection of OAM multiplexing signals are predominantly reliant\\non bulky optical components within complex optical setups. We introduce a\\ncompact solution for OAM information processing using laser-written glass\\nchips, facilitating efficient multiplexing and demultiplexing of multiple OAM\\ninformation channels. During the multiplexing process, OAM channels are managed\\nvia laser-scribed single-mode waveguides within a glass chip, with their modes\\nconverted using laser-written holograms on the side wall of the glass chip. The\\nreverse optical process is employed for OAM demultiplexing. Our chips\\nseamlessly interface with commercial optical fibers, ensuring compatibility\\nwith existing fiber-optic communication infrastructure. This work not only\\nestablishes a novel approach for OAM optical multiplexing but also underscores\\nthe potential of laser-writing technology in advancing photonics and its\\npractical applications in optical communications.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T04:40:57Z\"}"}
