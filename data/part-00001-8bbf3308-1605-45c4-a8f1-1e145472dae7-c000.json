While\\nunsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) mitigates label scarcity in PCSS, existing\\nmethods critically overlook the inherent vulnerability to real-world\\nperturbations (e.g., snow, fog, rain) and adversarial distortions. This work\\nfirst identifies two intrinsic limitations that undermine current PCSS-UDA\\nrobustness: (a) unsupervised features overlap from unaligned boundaries in\\nshared-class regions and (b) feature structure erosion caused by\\ndomain-invariant learning that suppresses target-specific patterns. To address\\nthe proposed problems, we propose a tripartite framework consisting of: 1) a\\nrobustness evaluation model quantifying resilience against adversarial\\nattack/corruption types through robustness metrics; 2) an invertible attention\\nalignment module (IAAM) enabling bidirectional domain mapping while preserving\\ndiscriminative structure via attention-guided overlap suppression; and 3) a\\ncontrastive memory bank with quality-aware contrastive learning that\\nprogressively refines pseudo-labels with feature quality for more\\ndiscriminative representations. Extensive experiments on\\nSynLiDAR-to-SemanticPOSS adaptation demonstrate a maximum mIoU improvement of\\n14.3\\\\% under adversarial attack.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:16:23Z\"}"}
