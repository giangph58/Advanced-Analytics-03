Our work studies a scheme of a ring under the\\nstrong resonant modulation that can support discrete-time quantum walk\\nincluding coherent multiple long-range translations in a natural way along\\nsynthetic frequency dimension. These multiple translation paths are added in a\\ncoherent way, which makes the walker evolve under the topological band.\\nTherein, not only the fast diffusion speed is expected, but more importantly,\\nwe find that single quantum gate operations can be performed in the\\nquasi-momentum space. In particular, we show the arbitrary single-qubit state\\npreparation and an example of CNOT two-qubit gate with only one time step,\\ndramarically increasing quantum algorithms. Our study uses a single ring to\\nprovide fast quantum gate operations based on coherent multiple path quantum\\nwalk, which may provide unique designs for efficient quantum operations on\\nphotonic chips.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:14:19Z\"}"}
