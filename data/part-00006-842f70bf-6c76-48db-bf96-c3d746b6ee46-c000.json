{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07042v1\", \"title\": \"Towards a Higher Roofline for Matrix-Vector Multiplication in\\n  Matrix-Free HOSFEM\", \"summary\": \"The high-order/spectral finite element method (HOSFEM) is a widely used\\nnumerical method for solving PDEs, with its performance primarily relying on\\naxhelm, a matrix-free kernel for element-local matrix-vector multiplications.\\nIn axhelm, geometric factors account for over half of memory access but\\nminimally contribute to computational workload. This imbalance significantly\\nconstrains the performance roofline, indicating that further optimization of\\ntensor contraction, the core computation in axhelm, yields only minimal\\nimprovements. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose a low-cost on-the-fly\\nrecalculation of geometric factors for trilinear elements, thereby unlocking\\nsubstantial potential for optimizing tensor contraction. The proposed approach\\nis implemented in Nekbone, a standard HOSFEM benchmark. With optimizations such\\nas merging scalar factors, partial recalculation, Tensor Core acceleration, and\\nconstant memory utilization, performance reaches 85%-100% of the higher\\nroofline. The optimized kernels achieve speedups of 1.74x-4.10x on NVIDIA A100\\nand 1.99x-3.77x on DCU K100. This leads to a 1.12x-1.40x speedup for Nekbone.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.PF\", \"categories\": \"cs.PF,cs.MS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T17:00:05Z\"}"}
