{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01699v1\", \"title\": \"High-Order Flux Splitting Schemes for the Euler Equations of Gas\\n  Dynamics\", \"summary\": \"We develop high-order flux splitting schemes for the one- and two-dimensional\\nEuler equations of gas dynamics. The proposed schemes are high-order extensions\\nof the existing first-order flux splitting schemes introduced in [ E. F. Toro,\\nM. E. V\\\\'azquez-Cend\\\\'on, Comput. \\\\& Fluids, 70 (2012), pp. 1--12], where the\\nEuler equations of gas dynamics are split into two subsystems: the advection\\nand pressure systems. In this paper, we formulate the TV splitting within the\\nsemi-discrete framework to extend it to higher orders of accuracy for the first\\ntime. The second-order extension is obtained by using piecewise linear\\ninterpolant to reconstruct the one-sided point values of the unknowns. The\\nthird- and fifth-order schemes are developed using the finite-difference\\nalternative weighted essentially non-oscillatory (A-WENO) framework, which is\\nparticularly effective in handling multidimensional problems and provides a\\nmore straightforward approach to constructing higher-order WENO schemes. These\\nextensions significantly improve the resolution of discontinuities and the\\naccuracy of numerical solutions, as demonstrated by a series of numerical\\nexperiments of both the one- and two-dimensional Euler equations of gas\\ndynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:59:34Z\"}"}
