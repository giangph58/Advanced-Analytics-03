{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24276v1\", \"title\": \"Mitigation of correlated readout errors without randomized measurements\", \"summary\": \"Quantum simulation, the study of strongly correlated quantum matter using\\nsynthetic quantum systems, has been the most successful application of quantum\\ncomputers to date. It often requires determining observables with high\\nprecision, for example when studying critical phenomena near quantum phase\\ntransitions. Thus, readout errors must be carefully characterized and mitigated\\nin data post-processing, using scalable and noise-model agnostic protocols. We\\npresent a readout error mitigation protocol that uses only single-qubit Pauli\\nmeasurements and avoids experimentally challenging randomized measurements. The\\nproposed approach captures a very broad class of correlated noise models and is\\nscalable to large qubit systems. It is based on a complete and efficient\\ncharacterization of few-qubit correlated positive operator-valued measures\\n(POVMs), using overlapping detector tomography. To assess the effectiveness of\\nthe protocol, observables are extracted from simulations involving up to 100\\nqubits employing readout errors obtained from experiments with superconducting\\nqubits.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:21:45Z\"}"}
