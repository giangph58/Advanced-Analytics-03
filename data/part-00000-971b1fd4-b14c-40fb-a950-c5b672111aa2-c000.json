However, if evolution typically takes ~4Gyr to produce\\nintelligent life-forms like us, then the limited lifespan of Earth's biosphere\\n(~5-6Gyr) necessitates an early (and possibly highly atypical) start to our\\nemergence - an example of the weak anthropic principle. Our previously proposed\\nobjective Bayesian analysis of Earth's chronology culminated in a formula for\\nthe minimum odds ratio between the fast and slow abiogenesis scenarios\\n(relative to Earth's lifespan). Timing from microfossils (3.7Gya) yields 3:1\\nodds in favor of rapid abiogenesis, whereas evidence from carbon isotopes\\n(4.1Gya) gives 9:1, both below the canonical threshold of \\\"strong evidence\\\"\\n(10:1). However, the recent result of a 4.2Gya LUCA pushes the odds over the\\nthreshold for the first time (nominally 13:1). In fact, the odds ratio is >10:1\\nfor all possible values of the biosphere's ultimate lifespan and speculative\\nhypotheses of ancient civilizations. For the first time, we have formally\\nstrong evidence that favors the hypothesis that life rapidly emerges in\\nEarth-like conditions (although such environments may themselves be rare).\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:55:50Z\"}"}
