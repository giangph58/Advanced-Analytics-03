{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06147v1\", \"title\": \"Noncommutative resolutions and CICY quotients from a non-abelian GLSM\", \"summary\": \"We discuss a one-parameter non-abelian GLSM with gauge group $(U(1)\\\\times\\nU(1)\\\\times U(1))\\\\rtimes\\\\mathbb{Z}_3$ and its associated Calabi-Yau phases. The\\nlarge volume phase is a free $\\\\mathbb{Z}_3$-quotient of a codimension $3$\\ncomplete intersection of degree-$(1,1,1)$ hypersurfaces in\\n$\\\\mathbb{P}^2\\\\times\\\\mathbb{P}^2\\\\times\\\\mathbb{P}^2$. The associated Calabi-Yau\\ndifferential operator has a second point of maximal unipotent monodromy,\\nleading to the expectation that the other GLSM phase is geometric as well.\\nHowever, the associated GLSM phase appears to be a hybrid model with continuous\\nunbroken gauge symmetry and cubic superpotential, together with a Coulomb\\nbranch. Using techniques from topological string theory and mirror symmetry we\\ncollect evidence that the phase should correspond to a non-commutative\\nresolution, in the sense of Katz-Klemm-Schimannek-Sharpe, of a codimension two\\ncomplete intersection in weighted projective space with $63$ nodal points, for\\nwhich a resolution has $\\\\mathbb{Z}_3$-torsion. We compute the associated\\nGopakumar-Vafa invariants up to genus $11$, incorporating their torsion\\nrefinement. We identify two integral symplectic bases constructed from\\ntopological data of the mirror geometries in either phase.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T15:42:39Z\"}"}
