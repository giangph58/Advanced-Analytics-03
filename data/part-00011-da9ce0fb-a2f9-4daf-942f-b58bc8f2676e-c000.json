{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04830v1\", \"title\": \"X-ray particle tracking velocimetry for rheological characterization:\\n  Application to material extrusion additive manufacturing\", \"summary\": \"We introduce X-ray Particle Tracking Velocimetry (XPTV) as a promising method\\nto quantitatively resolve the velocity field and associated rheological\\nquantities of polymer melt flow within the nozzle of a fused filament\\nfabrication (FFF) printer. Employing tungsten powder as tracer particles\\nembedded within a polymer filament, we investigate melt flow dynamics through\\nan aluminum nozzle in a custom-designed experimental setup, based on commercial\\ndesigns. The velocity profiles obtained via XPTV reveal significant deviations\\nfrom classical Newtonian flow, highlighting complex heterogeneous and\\nnon-isothermal behavior within the melt. From these measurements, we determine\\nthe local infinitesimal strain rate tensor and correlate flow-induced\\nnon-Newtonian effects to spatially varying temperature distributions,\\nreflecting incomplete thermal homogenization within the nozzle. Our findings\\ndemonstrate the capability of XPTV to quantify both velocity fields and\\nrheological properties, underscoring its potential as a future tool for\\ninvestigating opaque polymer melt flows in additive manufacturing, industrial\\nprocessing, and rheology. To our knowledge, this represents the first reported\\napplication of XPTV in polymer melt rheology, offering a new approach to\\naddress measurement challenges previously inaccessible to conventional optical\\nmethods.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T08:40:40Z\"}"}
