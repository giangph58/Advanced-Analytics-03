The model first applies STL and FFT to extract\\ntrend, seasonal, and denoised residual components, effectively filtering out\\nhigh-frequency noise. The filtered residuals are then fed into a stacked LSTM\\nto capture long-term dependencies, followed by a multi-head attention mechanism\\nthat dynamically focuses on key time steps. Experiments conducted on real-world\\nurban air quality datasets demonstrate that FALNet consistently outperforms\\nconventional models across standard metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and $R^2$. The\\nmodel shows strong adaptability in capturing sharp fluctuations during\\npollution peaks and non-stationary conditions. These results validate the\\neffectiveness and generalizability of FALNet for real-time air pollution\\nprediction, environmental risk assessment, and decision-making support.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:07:33Z\"}"}
