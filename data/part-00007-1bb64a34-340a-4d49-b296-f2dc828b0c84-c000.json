{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02432v1\", \"title\": \"Robust Randomized Low-Rank Approximation with Row-Wise Outlier Detection\", \"summary\": \"Robust low-rank approximation under row-wise adversarial corruption can be\\nachieved with a single pass, randomized procedure that detects and removes\\noutlier rows by thresholding their projected norms. We propose a scalable,\\nnon-iterative algorithm that efficiently recovers the underlying low-rank\\nstructure in the presence of row-wise adversarial corruption. By first\\ncompressing the data with a Johnson Lindenstrauss projection, our approach\\npreserves the geometry of clean rows while dramatically reducing\\ndimensionality. Robust statistical techniques based on the median and median\\nabsolute deviation then enable precise identification and removal of outlier\\nrows with abnormally high norms. The subsequent rank-k approximation achieves\\nnear-optimal error bounds with a one pass procedure that scales linearly with\\nthe number of observations. Empirical results confirm that combining random\\nsketches with robust statistics yields efficient, accurate decompositions even\\nin the presence of large fractions of corrupted rows.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.NA,math.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T09:43:27Z\"}"}
