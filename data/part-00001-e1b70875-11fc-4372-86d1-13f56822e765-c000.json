In this Note, we explore the differences in magnetic field\\nstrength of central and satellite galaxies from the magnetohydrodynamic TNG100\\nsimulation. We find that on average, magnetic fields in satellite galaxies are\\nroughly an order of magnitude stronger than those of central galaxies with\\ncomparable masses. The difference is greater for satellites that have already\\napproached within $1 R_{200}$ of their host galaxies. These results indicate\\nthat magnetic fields in satellite galaxies are amplified by environmental\\nprocesses as they fall into a host halo.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T16:09:50Z\"}"}
