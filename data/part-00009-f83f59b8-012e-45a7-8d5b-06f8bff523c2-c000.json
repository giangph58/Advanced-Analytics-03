Although counting the number of connected sets in a graph is\\ngenerally a \\\\#P-complete problem, it remains an active area of research. In\\n2020, Vince posed the problem of finding a formula for the number of connected\\nsets in the $(n\\\\times n)$-grid graph. In this paper, we establish a sharp upper\\nbound for the number of connected sets in any grid graph by using multistep\\nrecurrence formulas, which further derives enumeration formulas for the numbers\\nof connected sets in $(3\\\\times n)$- and $(4\\\\times n)$-grid graphs, thus solving\\na special case of the general problem posed by Vince. In the process, we also\\ndetermine the number of connected sets of $K_{m}\\\\times P_{n}$ by employing the\\ntransfer matrix method, where $K_{m}\\\\times P_{n}$ is the Cartesian product of\\nthe complete graph of order $m$ and the path of order $n$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T06:35:35Z\"}"}
