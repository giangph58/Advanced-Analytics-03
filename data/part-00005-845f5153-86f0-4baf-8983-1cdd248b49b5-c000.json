{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01597v1\", \"title\": \"A topology-preserving three-stage framework for fully-connected coronary\\n  artery extraction\", \"summary\": \"Coronary artery extraction is a crucial prerequisite for computer-aided\\ndiagnosis of coronary artery disease. Accurately extracting the complete\\ncoronary tree remains challenging due to several factors, including presence of\\nthin distal vessels, tortuous topological structures, and insufficient\\ncontrast. These issues often result in over-segmentation and under-segmentation\\nin current segmentation methods. To address these challenges, we propose a\\ntopology-preserving three-stage framework for fully-connected coronary artery\\nextraction. This framework includes vessel segmentation, centerline\\nreconnection, and missing vessel reconstruction. First, we introduce a new\\ncenterline enhanced loss in the segmentation process. Second, for the broken\\nvessel segments, we further propose a regularized walk algorithm to integrate\\ndistance, probabilities predicted by a centerline classifier, and directional\\ncosine similarity, for reconnecting the centerlines. Third, we apply implicit\\nneural representation and implicit modeling, to reconstruct the geometric model\\nof the missing vessels. Experimental results show that our proposed framework\\noutperforms existing methods, achieving Dice scores of 88.53\\\\% and 85.07\\\\%,\\nwith Hausdorff Distances (HD) of 1.07mm and 1.63mm on ASOCA and PDSCA datasets,\\nrespectively.
