In\\nthis work we review recent progress (since Les Houches 2021) in fixed-order\\ncomputations for LHC applications. In addition, necessary ingredients for such\\ncalculations such as parton distribution functions, amplitudes, and subtraction\\nmethods are discussed. Finally, we indicate processes and missing higher-order\\ncorrections that are required to reach the theoretical accuracy that matches\\nthe anticipated experimental precision.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T08:50:05Z\"}"}
