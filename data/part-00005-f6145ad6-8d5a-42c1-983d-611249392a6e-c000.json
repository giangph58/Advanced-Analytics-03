Math. (Basel) 123 (2024), no. 4,\\n379-383] determined partial Dedekind zeta values for certain ideal classes in\\nthe real quadratic fields of the form $\\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\sqrt{9m^2+2m})$, where\\n$9m^2+2m$ is square-free and $m\\\\equiv 2\\\\pmod 3$ is an odd positive integer. We\\nuse these partial Dedekind zeta values to investigate the small class numbers\\nof such fields. More precisely, we prove that the class numbers of the fields\\nin the above mentioned family are at least $4$. Further, we provide a\\nsufficient condition permitting to specify the structure of the class groups of\\norder $4$ in this family of fields.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T06:46:18Z\"}"}
