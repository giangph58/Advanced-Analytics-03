{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02670v1\", \"title\": \"Affordable AI Assistants with Knowledge Graph of Thoughts\", \"summary\": \"Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the development of AI\\nassistants capable of performing diverse tasks across domains. However, current\\nstate-of-the-art LLM-driven agents face significant challenges, including high\\noperational costs and limited success rates on complex benchmarks like GAIA. To\\naddress these issues, we propose the Knowledge Graph of Thoughts (KGoT), an\\ninnovative AI assistant architecture that integrates LLM reasoning with\\ndynamically constructed knowledge graphs (KGs). KGoT extracts and structures\\ntask-relevant knowledge into a dynamic KG representation, iteratively enhanced\\nthrough external tools such as math solvers, web crawlers, and Python scripts.\\nSuch structured representation of task-relevant knowledge enables low-cost\\nmodels to solve complex tasks effectively. For example, KGoT achieves a 29%\\nimprovement in task success rates on the GAIA benchmark compared to Hugging\\nFace Agents with GPT-4o mini, while reducing costs by over 36x compared to\\nGPT-4o. Improvements for recent reasoning models are similar, e.g., 36% and\\n37.5% for Qwen2.5-32B and Deepseek-R1-70B, respectively. KGoT offers a\\nscalable, affordable, and high-performing solution for AI assistants.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.CL,cs.IR,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:11:55Z\"}"}
