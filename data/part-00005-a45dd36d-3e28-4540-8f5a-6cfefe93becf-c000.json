In addition, we establish a\\ndiscrete analogue of the modulated energy estimate around constant states with\\na small velocity. Numerical experiments are carried to illustrate our\\ntheoretical results and to assess the accuracy of our scheme. A test case of\\nthe literature is also illustrated.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:39:02Z\"}"}
