{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02631v1\", \"title\": \"Feature splitting parallel algorithm for Dantzig selectors\", \"summary\": \"The Dantzig selector is a widely used and effective method for variable\\nselection in ultra-high-dimensional data. Feature splitting is an efficient\\nprocessing technique that involves dividing these ultra-high-dimensional\\nvariable datasets into manageable subsets that can be stored and processed more\\neasily on a single machine. This paper proposes a variable splitting parallel\\nalgorithm for solving both convex and nonconvex Dantzig selectors based on the\\nproximal point algorithm. The primary advantage of our parallel algorithm,\\ncompared to existing parallel approaches, is the significantly reduced number\\nof iteration variables, which greatly enhances computational efficiency and\\naccelerates the convergence speed of the algorithm. Furthermore, we show that\\nour solution remains unchanged regardless of how the data is partitioned, a\\nproperty referred to as partitioninsensitive. In theory, we use a concise proof\\nframework to demonstrate that the algorithm exhibits linear convergence.\\nNumerical experiments indicate that our algorithm performs competitively in\\nboth parallel and nonparallel environments. The R package for implementing the\\nproposed algorithm can be obtained at https://github.com/xfwu1016/PPADS.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.CO\", \"categories\": \"stat.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:28:50Z\"}"}
