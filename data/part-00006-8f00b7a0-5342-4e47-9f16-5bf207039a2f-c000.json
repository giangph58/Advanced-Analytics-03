We show that any\\ncomplete, oriented, immersed minimal surface in $\\\\mathbb{R}^4$ of finite total\\ncurvature with genus $1$ and three such ends must be $J$-holomorphic for some\\nalmost complex structure $J$. Under the additional assumptions of embeddedness\\nand at least $8$ symmetries, we prove that the number of symmetries must be\\neither $8$ or $12$, and in each case, the surface is uniquely determined up to\\nrigid motions and scalings. Furthermore, we establish a nonexistence result for\\ngenus $g\\\\geq2$ when the surface is embedded and has at least $4(g+1)$\\nsymmetries. Our approach is based on a modification of the method of Costa and\\nHoffman-Meeks in the setting of $\\\\mathbb{R}^4$, utilizing the generalized\\nWeierstrass representation.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T05:08:10Z\"}"}
