As the\\ndimension of electronic devices shrinks to just a few nanometers, the need for\\nnew effective-mass based 3D implementations of NEGF has become increasingly\\napparent. This work extends our previous Finite-Volume implementation --\\noriginally developed for the self-consistent solution of the Schr\\\\\\\"odinger and\\nPoisson equations in 2D -- into a full 3D NEGF framework. Our implementation\\nbegins with exploring a few problems with the common textbook Finite Difference\\nimplementations of NEGF. We then concisely demonstrate how Finite-Volume\\ndiscretization addresses few key implementation challenges. Importantly, we\\nexplain how this type of discretization enables evaluating the self-energies,\\nwhich account for the effects of reservoirs. The potential applications of this\\nnew method are illustrated through two examples. We anticipate that this\\nimplementation will be broadly applicable to open quantum systems, especially\\nin cases where a fully three-dimensional domain is essential.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T08:13:36Z\"}"}
