{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01740v1\", \"title\": \"Stable Structure Learning with HC-Stable and Tabu-Stable Algorithms\", \"summary\": \"Many Bayesian Network structure learning algorithms are unstable, with the\\nlearned graph sensitive to arbitrary dataset artifacts, such as the ordering of\\ncolumns (i.e., variable order). PC-Stable attempts to address this issue for\\nthe widely-used PC algorithm, prompting researchers to use the \\\"stable\\\" version\\ninstead. However, this problem seems to have been overlooked for score-based\\nalgorithms. In this study, we show that some widely-used score-based\\nalgorithms, as well as hybrid and constraint-based algorithms, including\\nPC-Stable, suffer from the same issue. We propose a novel solution for\\nscore-based greedy hill-climbing that eliminates instability by determining a\\nstable node order, leading to consistent results regardless of variable\\nordering. Two implementations, HC-Stable and Tabu-Stable, are introduced.\\nTabu-Stable achieves the highest BIC scores across all networks, and the\\nhighest accuracy for categorical networks. These results highlight the\\nimportance of addressing instability in structure learning and provide a robust\\nand practical approach for future applications. This extends the scope and\\nimpact of our previous work presented at Probabilistic Graphical Models 2024 by\\nincorporating continuous variables. The implementation, along with usage\\ninstructions, is freely available on GitHub at\\nhttps://github.com/causal-iq/discovery.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T13:51:44Z\"}"}
