It is debated whether their\\nquenching is driven by internal processes or environmental effects, which has\\nbeen challenging due to the lack of observations during their peak formation\\nepoch. Here we report clear evidence from ALMA of extended and elongated gas\\ntails in nine galaxies in a forming cluster at z = 2.51. The distinct gas\\ndistribution compared to the stellar emission probed by JWST, which is rather\\nisolated without signatures of mergers or interactions, provides evidence of\\nram-pressure stripping (RPS). This represents the most distant confirmed case\\nof RPS, highlighting the critical role of environmental effects in gas removal\\nat high redshifts, an often overlooked quenching pathway.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:36:57Z\"}"}
