{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21683v1\", \"title\": \"LLM-Gomoku: A Large Language Model-Based System for Strategic Gomoku\\n  with Self-Play and Reinforcement Learning\", \"summary\": \"In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have shown significant\\nadvancements in natural language processing (NLP), with strong capa-bilities in\\ngeneration, comprehension, and rea-soning. These models have found applications\\nin education, intelligent decision-making, and gaming. However, effectively\\nutilizing LLMs for strategic planning and decision-making in the game of Gomoku\\nremains a challenge. This study aims to develop a Gomoku AI system based on\\nLLMs, simulating the human learning process of playing chess. The system is\\nde-signed to understand and apply Gomoku strat-egies and logic to make rational\\ndecisions. The research methods include enabling the model to \\\"read the board,\\\"\\n\\\"understand the rules,\\\" \\\"select strategies,\\\" and \\\"evaluate positions,\\\" while\\nen-hancing its abilities through self-play and rein-forcement learning. The\\nresults demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the se-lection of\\nmove positions, resolves the issue of generating illegal positions, and reduces\\npro-cess time through parallel position evaluation. After extensive self-play\\ntraining, the model's Gomoku-playing capabilities have been notably enhanced.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T16:52:25Z\"}"}
