In this work, we propose a data-driven\\ndynamic modeling and economic predictive control approach within the Koopman\\nframework. This integrated modeling and control approach is used to achieve\\nsafe and energy-efficient process operation of shipboard post-combustion carbon\\ncapture plants. Specifically, we propose a deep neural Koopman operator\\nmodeling approach, based on which a Koopman model with time-varying model\\nparameters is established. This Koopman model predicts the overall economic\\noperational cost and key system outputs, based on accessible partial state\\nmeasurements. By leveraging this learned model, a constrained economic\\npredictive control scheme is developed. Despite time-varying parameters\\ninvolved in the formulated model, the formulated optimization problem\\nassociated with the economic predictive control design is convex, and it can be\\nsolved efficiently during online control implementations. Extensive tests are\\nconducted on a high-fidelity simulation environment for shipboard\\npost-combustion carbon capture processes. Four ship operational conditions are\\ntaken into account. The results show that the proposed method significantly\\nimproves the overall economic operational performance and carbon capture rate.\\nAdditionally, the proposed method guarantees safe operation by ensuring that\\nhard constraints on the system outputs are satisfied.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.LG,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T12:22:42Z\"}"}
