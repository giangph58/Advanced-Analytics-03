In this study, we present a comprehensive bulk and\\nmicroscopic investigation of the rarely observed equiatomic hexagonal HEA\\nNb-Mo-Ru-Re-Ir using magnetization, resistivity, heat capacity, and muon spin\\nrelaxation and rotation ($\\\\mu$SR) measurements. Our findings confirm bulk\\ntype-II superconductivity with a transition temperature of 4.63(2) K and a high\\nupper critical field. Heat capacity and transverse-field $\\\\mu$SR data reveal\\nconventional s-wave superconductivity, while zero-field $\\\\mu$SR results suggest\\nthe preservation of time-reversal symmetry in the superconducting state. These\\nfindings provide valuable insights into the superconducting pairing mechanism\\nin disordered multicomponent systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:35:53Z\"}"}
