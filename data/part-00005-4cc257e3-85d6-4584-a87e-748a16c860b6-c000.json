Using\\ncontraction techniques, we study the stability of such a process and provide\\nupper bounds on how fast it reaches the periodically stationary regime. We then\\npropose a computationally efficient Markov approximation using the properties\\nof the exponential function and a density result. Furthermore, we prove the\\nstrong consistency of the maximum likelihood estimator for the Markov\\napproximation and empirically test its robustness in the case of\\nmisspecification. Our model is applied to the prediction of weekly Rotavirus\\ncases in Berlin, demonstrating superior performance compared to the existing\\nPNAR model.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,math.PR,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:48:11Z\"}"}
