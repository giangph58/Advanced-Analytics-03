In this way we generalize the main result of the recent paper\\n[T5], where the notion of a quasi-norm form is introduced when F = Q and S is a\\nsingleton. In complement, we exhibit some relations with problems and results\\nin this area of research.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:04:51Z\"}"}
