As the wave packet propagates in a\\ndispersive medium, the radially distributed Airy beam converges inward to the\\ncenter point. Two Airy pulses counter-propagate toward each other to merge to\\nform a high peak power pulse. As the result, the high intensity emerges\\nabruptly as the wave packet achieves three-dimensional focusing. This\\nautofocusing effect is believed to have potential applications such as material\\nmodification, plasma physics, nanoparticle manipulations, etc.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T04:26:51Z\"}"}
