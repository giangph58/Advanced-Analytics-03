In this paper, by replacing\\nthe density with the Distance-to-Measure, we introduce a new metric, the Fermat\\nDistance-to-Measure, defined for any probability measure in R^d. We derive\\nstrong stability properties for the Fermat Distance-to-Measure with respect to\\nthe measure and propose an estimator from random sampling of the measure,\\nfeaturing an explicit bound on its convergence speed.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T08:19:19Z\"}"}
