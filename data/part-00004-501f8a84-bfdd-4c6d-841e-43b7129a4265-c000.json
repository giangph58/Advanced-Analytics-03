{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06078v1\", \"title\": \"Carbon, Cost and Capacity: Multi-objective Charging of Electric Buses\", \"summary\": \"The public transport sector is in the process of decarbonizing by\\nelectrifying its bus fleets. This results in challenges if the high electricity\\ndemand resulting from battery charging demand is confronted with limited grid\\ncapacity and high synchronicity at bus charging sites. In this paper, we\\nexplore multi-objective scheduling for bus charging sites to minimize the\\nemissions associated with charging processes and to aid the operation of the\\nelectricity grid by mitigating peak consumption. In particular, we discuss and\\nvalidate optimization approaches for those objectives, as well as their\\nweighted combination, based on data from a real-life bus charging site in the\\nNetherlands. The simulation results show that compared to uncontrolled\\ncharging, power peaks can be reduced by up to 57%, while time-of-use emissions\\nassociated with the charging of electric buses are also reduced significantly.\\nFurthermore, by using a synthetic baseload, we illustrate the flexibility\\npotential offered by bus charging sites, and advocate that such sites should\\nshare a grid connection with other high-load assets.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:17:32Z\"}"}
