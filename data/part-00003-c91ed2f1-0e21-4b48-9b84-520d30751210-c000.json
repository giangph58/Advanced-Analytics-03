Starting from the general solution of the sourced Maxwell\\nequations written in terms of multipole moments as obtained by Iyer and Damour,\\nwe derive the expansion of the electromagnetic field perturbatively in the\\nelectromagnetic coupling. At leading order, where the effect of long-range\\nCoulombic interactions between charged particles is neglected, we discover\\ninfinite sets of antipodal matching relations satisfied by the electromagnetic\\nfield, which extend and sometimes correct previously known relations. At\\nnext-to-leading order, electromagnetic tails resulting from these Coulombic\\ninteractions appear, which affect the antipodal matching relations beyond those\\nequivalent to the leading soft photon theorem. Moreover, new antipodal matching\\nrelations arise, which we use to re-derive the classical logarithmic soft\\nphoton theorem of Sahoo and Sen. Our analysis largely builds upon that of\\nCampiglia and Laddha, although it invalidates the antipodal matching relation\\nwhich they originally used in their derivation.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T10:35:22Z\"}"}
