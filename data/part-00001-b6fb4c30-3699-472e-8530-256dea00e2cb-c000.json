We discuss how a fiber supporting many modes allows to truly\\ncouple higher-order STOVs, the number of modes necessary to support a STOV of a\\ncertain order, and conversely the truncation effect in a few-mode fiber. Based\\non the excited modes and their temporal profiles, we show numerical results for\\nthe linear and nonlinear propagation of STOVs in multimode fibers, specifically\\nthe linear space-time beating at short propagation distances, and the nonlinear\\ntrapping effect between modes producing stable states on long propagation\\ndistances. Our results underline how STOVs present a rich platform for\\nmultimode nonlinear optics and technology.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:48:14Z\"}"}
