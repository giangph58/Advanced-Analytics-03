We show that many\\naspects of nodal interpolation can naturally be carried to this more general\\nframework; in contrast, some of them require the introduction of geometric and\\nmeasure theoretic hypotheses. After characterizing the norms of the operators\\ninvolved, we introduce the concept of admissible integral k-mesh, which allows\\nfor the construction of robust approximation schemes, and is used to extract\\ninterpolation sets with high stability properties. To this end, the concepts of\\nFekete currents and Leja sequences of currents are formalized, and a numerical\\nscheme for their approximation is proposed.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T17:04:51Z\"}"}
