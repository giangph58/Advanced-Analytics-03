The characteristics of this loss function\\nare that it achieves high robustness and a wide range of applicability through\\npartition-wise design and adaptive parameter adjustment. Finally, the\\nadvantages and development potential of this loss function were verified by\\napplying this loss function to the regression question and using five different\\ndatasets (with different dimensions, different sample numbers, and different\\nfields) to compare with the other loss functions. The results of multiple\\nexperiments have proven the advantages of our loss function .\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:40:46Z\"}"}
