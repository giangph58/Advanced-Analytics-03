While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have\\nshown promising results by modeling molecules as molecular graphs, their\\nreliance on data-driven learning limits their ability to generalize,\\nparticularly in the presence of data imbalance and diverse molecular\\nsubstructures. Existing methods often overlook the varying contributions of\\ndifferent substructures to molecular properties, treating them uniformly. To\\naddress these challenges, we propose ASE-Mol, a novel GNN-based framework that\\nleverages a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach for molecular property\\nprediction. ASE-Mol incorporates BRICS decomposition and significant\\nsubstructure awareness to dynamically identify positive and negative\\nsubstructures. By integrating a MoE architecture, it reduces the adverse impact\\nof negative motifs while improving adaptability to positive motifs.\\nExperimental results on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that ASE-Mol\\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, with significant improvements in both\\naccuracy and interpretability.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:25:03Z\"}"}
