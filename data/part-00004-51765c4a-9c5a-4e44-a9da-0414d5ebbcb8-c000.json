The Erd\\\\H{o}s-Gallai theorem for paths states that\\nin a simple $P_k$-free graph, $m \\\\leq \\\\frac{n(k-1)}{2}$, where $P_k$ denotes a\\npath with length $k$ (that is, with $k$ edges). In this paper, we generalize\\nthis result as follows: For each $v \\\\in V(G)$, let $p(v)$ be the length of the\\nlongest path that contains $v$. We show that \\\\[m \\\\leq \\\\sum_{v \\\\in V(G)}\\n\\\\frac{p(v)}{2}\\\\] The Erd\\\\H{o}s-Gallai theorem for cycles states that in a\\nsimple graph $G$ with circumference (that is, the length of the longest cycle)\\nat most $k$, we have $m \\\\leq \\\\frac{k(n-1)}{2}$. We strengthen this result as\\nfollows: For each $v \\\\in V(G)$, let $c(v)$ be the length of the longest cycle\\nthat contains $v$, or $2$ if $v$ is not part of any cycle. We prove that \\\\[m\\n\\\\leq \\\\left( \\\\sum_{v \\\\in V(G)} \\\\frac{c(v)}{2} \\\\right) - \\\\frac{c(u)}{2}\\\\] where\\n$c(u)$ denotes the circumference of $G$. \\\\newline Furthermore, we characterize\\nthe class of extremal graphs that attain equality in these bounds.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,cs.DM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:52:28Z\"}"}
