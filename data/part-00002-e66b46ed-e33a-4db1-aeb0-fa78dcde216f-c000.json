We apply this to obtain\\na sufficient condition such that the composition operator on the pluriharmonic\\nBloch space is bounded below. As a partial converse, we also give a necessary\\ncondition for the boundedness (from below) of the composition operator on the\\nBloch space of holomorphic mappings in $\\\\mathbb{B}^n$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CV\", \"categories\": \"math.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T09:23:54Z\"}"}
