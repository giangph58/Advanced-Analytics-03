{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06093v1\", \"title\": \"Coupling approaches with non-matching grids for classical linear\\n  elasticity and bond-based peridynamic models in 1D\", \"summary\": \"Local-nonlocal coupling approaches provide a means to combine the\\ncomputational efficiency of local models and the accuracy of nonlocal models.\\nTo facilitate the coupling of the two models, non-matching grids are often\\ndesirable as nonlocal grids usually require a finer resolution than local\\ngrids. In that case, it is often convenient to resort to interpolation\\noperators so that models can exchange information in the overlap regions when\\nnodes from the two grids do not coincide. This paper studies three existing\\ncoupling approaches, namely 1) a method that enforces matching displacements in\\nan overlap region, 2) a variant that enforces a constraint on the stresses\\ninstead, and 3) a method that considers a variable horizon in the vicinity of\\nthe interfaces. The effect of the interpolation order and of the grid ratio on\\nthe performance of the three coupling methods with non-matching grids is\\ncarefully studied on one-dimensional examples using polynomial manufactured\\nsolutions. The numerical results show that the degree of the interpolants\\nshould be chosen with care to avoid introducing additional modeling errors, or\\nsimply minimize these errors, in the coupling approach.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CE\", \"categories\": \"cs.CE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:35:06Z\"}"}
