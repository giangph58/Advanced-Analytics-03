{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01663v1\", \"title\": \"Recovering Small Communities in the Planted Partition Model\", \"summary\": \"We analyze community recovery in the planted partition model (PPM) in regimes\\nwhere the number of communities is arbitrarily large. We examine the three\\nstandard recovery regimes: exact recovery, almost exact recovery, and weak\\nrecovery. When communities vary in size, traditional accuracy- or\\nalignment-based metrics become unsuitable for assessing the correctness of a\\npredicted partition. To address this, we redefine these recovery regimes using\\nthe correlation coefficient, a more versatile metric for comparing partitions.\\nWe then demonstrate that \\\\emph{Diamond Percolation}, an algorithm based on\\ncommon-neighbors, successfully recovers communities under mild assumptions on\\nedge probabilities, with minimal restrictions on the number and sizes of\\ncommunities. As a key application, we consider the case where community sizes\\nfollow a power-law distribution, a characteristic frequently found in\\nreal-world networks. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first\\nrecovery results for such unbalanced partitions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,cs.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:14:57Z\"}"}
