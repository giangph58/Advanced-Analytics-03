A typical recommender system handling multiple types\\nof feedback has two components: a multi-task learning (MTL) module, predicting\\nfeedback such as click-through rate and like rate; and a multi-task fusion\\n(MTF) module, integrating these predictions into a single score for item\\nranking. MTF is essential for ensuring user satisfaction, as it directly\\ninfluences recommendation outcomes. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has\\nbeen applied to MTF tasks to improve long-term user satisfaction. However,\\nexisting RL-based MTF methods are formula-based methods, which only adjust\\nlimited coefficients within pre-defined formulas. The pre-defined formulas\\nrestrict the RL search space and become a bottleneck for MTF. To overcome this,\\nwe propose a formula-free MTF framework. We demonstrate that any suitable\\nfusion function can be expressed as a composition of single-variable monotonic\\nfunctions, as per the Sprecher Representation Theorem. Leveraging this, we\\nintroduce a novel learnable monotonic fusion cell (MFC) to replace pre-defined\\nformulas. We call this new MFC-based model eXtreme MTF (xMTF). Furthermore, we\\nemploy a two-stage hybrid (TSH) learning strategy to train xMTF effectively. By\\nexpanding the MTF search space, xMTF outperforms existing methods in extensive\\noffline and online experiments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T04:28:22Z\"}"}
