{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01796v1\", \"title\": \"A New Approach to the Nonparametric Behrens-Fisher Problem with\\n  Compatible Confidence Intervals\", \"summary\": \"We propose a new test to address the nonparametric Behrens-Fisher problem\\ninvolving different distribution functions in the two samples. Our procedure\\ntests the null hypothesis $\\\\mathcal{H}_0: \\\\theta = \\\\frac{1}{2}$, where $\\\\theta\\n= P(X<Y) + \\\\frac{1}{2}P(X=Y)$ denotes the Mann-Whitney effect. No restrictions\\non the underlying distributions of the data are imposed with the trivial\\nexception of one-point distributions. The method is based on evaluating the\\nratio of the variance $\\\\sigma_N^2$ of the Mann-Whitney effect estimator\\n$\\\\widehat{\\\\theta}$ to its theoretical maximum, as derived from the\\nBirnbaum-Klose inequality. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the\\nproposed test effectively controls the type-I error rate under various\\nconditions, including small sample sizes, unbalanced designs, and different\\ndata-generating mechanisms. Notably, it provides better control of the type-1\\nerror rate compared to the widely used Brunner-Munzel test, particularly at\\nsmall significance levels such as $\\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\{0.01, 0.005\\\\}$. Additionally,\\nwe derive range-preserving compatible confidence intervals, showing that they\\noffer improved coverage over those compatible to the Brunner-Munzel test.\\nFinally, we illustrate the application of our method in a clinical trial\\nexample.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:03:01Z\"}"}
