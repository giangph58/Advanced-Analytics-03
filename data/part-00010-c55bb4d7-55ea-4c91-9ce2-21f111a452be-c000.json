Multivariate count models such as the\\nDirichlet-multinomial (DM), negative multinomial, and generalized DM\\naccommodate overdispersion but are difficult to optimize due to their\\nnon-concave likelihood functions. Further, for the class of regression models\\nthat associate covariates to the multivariate count outcomes, variable\\nselection becomes necessary as the number of potentially relevant factors\\nbecomes large. The sparse group lasso (SGL) is a natural choice for\\nregularizing these models. Motivated by understanding the associations between\\nwater quality and benthic macroinvertebrate compositions in Canada's Athabasca\\noil sands region, we develop dominating hyperplane regularization (DHR), a\\nnovel method for optimizing regularized regression models with the SGL penalty.\\nUnder the majorization-minimization framework, we show that applying DHR to a\\nSGL penalty gives rise to a surrogate function that can be expressed as a\\nweighted ridge penalty. Consequently, we prove that for multivariate count\\nregression models with the SGL penalty, the optimization leads to an\\niteratively reweighted Poisson ridge regression. We demonstrate stable\\noptimization and high performance of our algorithm through simulation and real\\nworld application to benthic macroinvertebrate compositions.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:56:43Z\"}"}
