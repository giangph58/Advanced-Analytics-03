We propose a method for\\nleveraging a large language model (GPT-4o) to automatically generate networks\\ncapable of adapting to dynamic environments. The proposed method collects\\nenvironmental \\\"status,\\\" representing conditions and goals, and uses them to\\ngenerate agents. These agents are interconnected on the basis of specific\\nconditions, resulting in networks that combine flexibility and generality. We\\nconducted evaluation experiments to compare the networks automatically\\ngenerated with the proposed method with manually constructed ones, confirming\\nthe comprehensiveness of the proposed method's networks and their higher\\ngenerality. This research marks a significant advancement toward the\\ndevelopment of versatile planning methods applicable to robotics, autonomous\\nvehicles, smart systems, and other complex environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:42:49Z\"}"}
