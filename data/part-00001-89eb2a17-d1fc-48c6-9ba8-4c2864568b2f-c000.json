{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24047v1\", \"title\": \"Towards Scientific Intelligence: A Survey of LLM-based Scientific Agents\", \"summary\": \"As scientific research becomes increasingly complex, innovative tools are\\nneeded to manage vast data, facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration, and\\naccelerate discovery. Large language models (LLMs) are now evolving into\\nLLM-based scientific agents that automate critical tasks, ranging from\\nhypothesis generation and experiment design to data analysis and simulation.\\nUnlike general-purpose LLMs, these specialized agents integrate domain-specific\\nknowledge, advanced tool sets, and robust validation mechanisms, enabling them\\nto handle complex data types, ensure reproducibility, and drive scientific\\nbreakthroughs. This survey provides a focused review of the architectures,\\ndesign, benchmarks, applications, and ethical considerations surrounding\\nLLM-based scientific agents. We highlight why they differ from general agents\\nand the ways in which they advance research across various scientific fields.\\nBy examining their development and challenges, this survey offers a\\ncomprehensive roadmap for researchers and practitioners to harness these agents\\nfor more efficient, reliable, and ethically sound scientific discovery.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.MA\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:11:28Z\"}"}
