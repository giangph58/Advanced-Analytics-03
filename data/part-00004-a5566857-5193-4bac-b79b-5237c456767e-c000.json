{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05768v1\", \"title\": \"Temporal Dynamic Embedding for Irregularly Sampled Time Series\", \"summary\": \"In several practical applications, particularly healthcare, clinical data of\\neach patient is individually recorded in a database at irregular intervals as\\nrequired. This causes a sparse and irregularly sampled time series, which makes\\nit difficult to handle as a structured representation of the prerequisites of\\nneural network models. We therefore propose temporal dynamic embedding (TDE),\\nwhich enables neural network models to receive data that change the number of\\nvariables over time. TDE regards each time series variable as an embedding\\nvector evolving over time, instead of a conventional fixed structured\\nrepresentation, which causes a critical missing problem. For each time step,\\nTDE allows for the selective adoption and aggregation of only observed variable\\nsubsets and represents the current status of patient based on current\\nobservations. The experiment was conducted on three clinical datasets:\\nPhysioNet 2012, MIMIC-III, and PhysioNet 2019. The TDE model performed\\ncompetitively or better than the imputation-based baseline and several recent\\nstate-of-the-art methods with reduced training runtime.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T07:49:22Z\"}"}
