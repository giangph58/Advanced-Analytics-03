In this work, we investigate the decoherence dynamics of\\nsystems coupled to multiple baths through noncommuting systems' operators, and\\nbeyond the weak system-bath coupling limit. By building on cooperative effects\\nbetween baths, we propose a novel strategy to mitigate rapid decoherence.\\nConcretely, we study the dynamics of a qubit coupled to multiple environments\\nwith arbitrary interaction strengths, and along different coordinates. Based on\\ninsights gained on the decoherence dynamics from the analytical Effective\\nHamiltonian method, we carry out numerical simulations using the Reaction\\nCoordinate quantum master equation method. In contrast to standard\\nexpectations, we show that when the system strongly interacts with a decohering\\nbath, increasing its coupling to a second, dissipative bath slows down the\\ndecoherence dynamics. Our work offers insights into the preservation of quantum\\ncoherences in open quantum systems based on frustration effects, by utilizing\\ncooperative effects between different heat baths.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T17:41:29Z\"}"}
