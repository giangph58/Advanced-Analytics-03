We\\nprove that smooth hypersurfaces defined by regular sequences of coefficients\\nare Mori dream spaces, generalizing a result of Ottem. We also compute Cox\\nrings of certain specialized examples. In particular, we compute Cox rings in\\nthe well-studied family of Calabi--Yau threefolds of bidegree (2,4) in P^1 x\\nP^3, determining explicitly how the Cox ring can jump discontinuously in a\\nsmooth family.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T09:44:51Z\"}"}
