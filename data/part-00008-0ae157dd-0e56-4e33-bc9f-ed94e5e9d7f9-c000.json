The annotations offer insights into the purpose of modified files,\\nchanges at the line level, and reviewers' confidence levels. We analyze\\nHaPy-Bug to examine the distribution of file purposes, types of modifications,\\nand tangled changes. Additionally, we explore its potential applications in bug\\ntracking, the analysis of bug-fixing practices, and the development of\\nrepository analysis tools. HaPy-Bug serves as a valuable resource for advancing\\nresearch in software maintenance and security.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T08:04:56Z\"}"}
