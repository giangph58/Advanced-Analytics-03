Instead of\\nsuppressing demand among disadvantaged consumers, our scheme increases supply\\nby involving privileged consumer-providers (prosumers) who under-utilize their\\nresources. This hybrid supply approach maintains high quality-of-service (QoS)\\nfor both consumers and prosumers in both normal and surge demand situations\\nwithout surge pricing. To ensure prosumer QoS, we reserve a small portion of\\nthe primary supply to meet their needs if their resources become unavailable\\nduring surge periods. As the probability of such events is low compared to that\\nof the surge demand itself, the reserved resources required are minimal. The\\nresulting scheme is resource-efficient, socially progressive, and sustainable,\\nexploiting under-used resources. We illustrate our scheme through two\\napplications: high-range car sharing for owners of small EVs, and shared\\ncharging points for EV drivers.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:12:03Z\"}"}
