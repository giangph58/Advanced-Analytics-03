{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06002v1\", \"title\": \"Has ACT measured radiative corrections to the tree-level Higgs-like\\n  inflation?\", \"summary\": \"Starobinsky inflation and non-minimally coupled Higgs inflation have been\\namong the most favored models of the early universe, as their predictions for\\nthe scalar spectral index $n_s$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ fall comfortably\\nwithin the constraints set by Planck and BICEP/Keck. However, new results from\\nthe Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) suggest a preference for higher values of\\n$n_s$, introducing tension with the simplest realizations of these models. In\\nthis work, being agnostic about the nature of the inflaton, we show that\\nincorporating one-loop corrections to a Higgs-like inflationary scenario leads\\nto a shift in the predicted value of $n_s$, which brings Higgs-like inflation\\ninto better agreement with ACT observations. Remarkably, we find that this can\\nbe achieved with non-minimal couplings $\\\\xi < 1$, in contrast to the large\\nvalues typically required in conventional Higgs inflation, thereby pushing any\\nunitarity-violation scale above the Planck scale. The effect is even more\\nsignificant when the model is formulated in the Palatini approach, where the\\nmodified field-space structure naturally enhances deviations from the metric\\ncase. These findings highlight the importance of quantum corrections and\\ngravitational degrees of freedom in refining inflationary predictions in light\\nof new data.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:11:58Z\"}"}
