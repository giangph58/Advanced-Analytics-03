{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02785v1\", \"title\": \"Beating full state tomography for unentangled spectrum estimation\", \"summary\": \"How many copies of a mixed state $\\\\rho \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}^{d \\\\times d}$ are\\nneeded to learn its spectrum? To date, the best known algorithms for spectrum\\nestimation require as many copies as full state tomography, suggesting the\\npossibility that learning a state's spectrum might be as difficult as learning\\nthe entire state. We show that this is not the case in the setting of\\nunentangled measurements, by giving a spectrum estimation algorithm that uses\\n$n = O(d^3\\\\cdot (\\\\log\\\\log(d) / \\\\log(d))^4 )$ copies of $\\\\rho$, which is\\nasymptotically fewer than the $n = \\\\Omega(d^3)$ copies necessary for full state\\ntomography. Our algorithm is inspired by the technique of local moment matching\\nfrom classical statistics, and shows how it can be applied in the quantum\\nsetting.\\n  As an important subroutine in our spectrum estimation algorithm, we give an\\nestimator of the $k$-th moment $\\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\rho^k)$ which performs\\nunentangled measurements and uses $O(d^{3-2/k})$ copies of $\\\\rho$ in order to\\nachieve a constant multiplicative error. This directly translates to an\\nadditive-error estimator of quantum Renyi entropy of order $k$ with the same\\nnumber of copies.\\n  Finally, we present numerical evidence that the sample complexity of spectrum\\nestimation can only improve over full state tomography by a sub-polynomial\\nfactor. Specifically, for spectrum learning with fully entangled measurements,\\nwe run simulations which suggest a lower bound of $\\\\Omega(d^{2 - \\\\gamma})$\\ncopies for any constant $\\\\gamma > 0$. From this, we conclude the current best\\nlower bound of $\\\\Omega(d)$ is likely not tight.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.CC,cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T17:29:12Z\"}"}
