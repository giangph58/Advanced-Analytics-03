{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24034v1\", \"title\": \"Creation of a black hole bomb instability in an electromagnetic system\", \"summary\": \"The amplification and generation of electromagnetic radiation by a rotating\\nmetallic or lossy cylinder, first theorized by Zeldovich in the 1970s, is\\ntightly connected to the concepts of quantum friction, energy extraction from\\nrotating black holes and runaway mechanisms such as black hole bombs. Despite\\nrecent advances including acoustic analogues of the Zeldovich effect and the\\nobservation of a negative resistance in a low-frequency electromagnetic model,\\nactual positive signal amplitude gain, the spontaneous generation of\\nelectromagnetic waves and runaway amplifi- cation effects have never been\\nexperimentally verified. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that a\\nmechanically rotating metallic cylinder not only definitively acts as an\\namplifier of a rotating elec- tromagnetic field mode but also, when paired with\\na low-loss resonator, becomes unstable and acts as a generator, seeded only by\\nnoise. The system exhibits an exponential runaway amplification of\\nspontaneously generated electromagnetic modes thus demonstrating the\\nelectromagnetic analogue of Press and Teukolskys black hole bomb. The\\nexponential amplification from noise supports theoretical investigations into\\nblack hole instabilities and is promising for the development of future\\nexperiments to observe quantum friction in the form of the Zeldovich effect\\nseeded by the quantum vacuum.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.app-ph,physics.ins-det\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:00:10Z\"}"}
