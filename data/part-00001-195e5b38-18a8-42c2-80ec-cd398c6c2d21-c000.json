This constitutes a macroscopic analogue of a theorem by\\nBray--Brendle--Neves on the area of non-contractible 2-spheres in a closed\\nRiemannian 3-manifold with positive scalar curvature. Our proof is based on an\\nadaptation of Guth's macroscopic version of the Schoen-Yau descent argument.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T09:51:03Z\"}"}
