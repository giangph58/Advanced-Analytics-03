{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07549v1\", \"title\": \"STeP: A General and Scalable Framework for Solving Video Inverse\\n  Problems with Spatiotemporal Diffusion Priors\", \"summary\": \"We study how to solve general Bayesian inverse problems involving videos\\nusing diffusion model priors. While it is desirable to use a video diffusion\\nprior to effectively capture complex temporal relationships, due to the\\ncomputational and data requirements of training such a model, prior work has\\ninstead relied on image diffusion priors on single frames combined with\\nheuristics to enforce temporal consistency. However, these approaches struggle\\nwith faithfully recovering the underlying temporal relationships, particularly\\nfor tasks with high temporal uncertainty. In this paper, we demonstrate the\\nfeasibility of practical and accessible spatiotemporal diffusion priors by\\nfine-tuning latent video diffusion models from pretrained image diffusion\\nmodels using limited videos in specific domains. Leveraging this plug-and-play\\nspatiotemporal diffusion prior, we introduce a general and scalable framework\\nfor solving video inverse problems. We then apply our framework to two\\nchallenging scientific video inverse problems--black hole imaging and dynamic\\nMRI. Our framework enables the generation of diverse, high-fidelity video\\nreconstructions that not only fit observations but also recover multi-modal\\nsolutions. By incorporating a spatiotemporal diffusion prior, we significantly\\nimprove our ability to capture complex temporal relationships in the data while\\nalso enhancing spatial fidelity.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T08:24:26Z\"}"}
