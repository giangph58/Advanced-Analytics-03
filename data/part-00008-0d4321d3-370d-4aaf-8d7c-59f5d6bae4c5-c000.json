The rate expression allows to derive the optimal unitary and symmetric\\nscattering BD-RIS matrix in closed form. Our simulation results show that the\\nproposed solution is competitive even under the more usual Ricean channel\\nfading model when the direct link is weak.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T10:48:52Z\"}"}
