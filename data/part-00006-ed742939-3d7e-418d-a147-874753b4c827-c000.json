{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05755v1\", \"title\": \"Unraveling Human-AI Teaming: A Review and Outlook\", \"summary\": \"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is advancing at an unprecedented pace, with\\nclear potential to enhance decision-making and productivity. Yet, the\\ncollaborative decision-making process between humans and AI remains\\nunderdeveloped, often falling short of its transformative possibilities. This\\npaper explores the evolution of AI agents from passive tools to active\\ncollaborators in human-AI teams, emphasizing their ability to learn, adapt, and\\noperate autonomously in complex environments. This paradigm shifts challenges\\ntraditional team dynamics, requiring new interaction protocols, delegation\\nstrategies, and responsibility distribution frameworks. Drawing on Team\\nSituation Awareness (SA) theory, we identify two critical gaps in current\\nhuman-AI teaming research: the difficulty of aligning AI agents with human\\nvalues and objectives, and the underutilization of AI's capabilities as genuine\\nteam members. Addressing these gaps, we propose a structured research outlook\\ncentered on four key aspects of human-AI teaming: formulation, coordination,\\nmaintenance, and training. Our framework highlights the importance of shared\\nmental models, trust-building, conflict resolution, and skill adaptation for\\neffective teaming. Furthermore, we discuss the unique challenges posed by\\nvarying team compositions, goals, and complexities. This paper provides a\\nfoundational agenda for future research and practical design of sustainable,\\nhigh-performing human-AI teams.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.AI,econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T07:37:25Z\"}"}
