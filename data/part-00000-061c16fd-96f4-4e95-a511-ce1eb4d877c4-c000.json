In the second implementation, called the\\nNon-Demolition approach, the gradient information is stored in a quantum\\ndetector, which is eventually measured. As prototypical examples, we study the\\nenergy minimization of the Lithium-based molecules and then extend the analysis\\nsystems with increased complexity. We find that, while both approaches are able\\nto identify the energy minimum, the Non-Demolition approach has a clear\\nadvantage in terms of the overall computational resources needed. This\\nadvantage increases linearly with the complexity of the quantum system, making\\nthe Non-Demolition approach the ideal candidate to implement such variational\\nquantum algorithms.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:42:21Z\"}"}
