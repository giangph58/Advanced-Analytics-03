To this end, we present\\nHiFlow, a training-free and model-agnostic framework to unlock the resolution\\npotential of pre-trained flow models. Specifically, HiFlow establishes a\\nvirtual reference flow within the high-resolution space that effectively\\ncaptures the characteristics of low-resolution flow information, offering\\nguidance for high-resolution generation through three key aspects:\\ninitialization alignment for low-frequency consistency, direction alignment for\\nstructure preservation, and acceleration alignment for detail fidelity. By\\nleveraging this flow-aligned guidance, HiFlow substantially elevates the\\nquality of high-resolution image synthesis of T2I models and demonstrates\\nversatility across their personalized variants. Extensive experiments validate\\nHiFlow's superiority in achieving superior high-resolution image quality over\\ncurrent state-of-the-art methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T17:30:40Z\"}"}
