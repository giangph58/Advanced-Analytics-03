{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05945v1\", \"title\": \"CKGAN: Training Generative Adversarial Networks Using Characteristic\\n  Kernel Integral Probability Metrics\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we propose CKGAN, a novel generative adversarial network (GAN)\\nvariant based on an integral probability metrics framework with characteristic\\nkernel (CKIPM). CKIPM, as a distance between two probability distributions, is\\ndesigned to optimize the lowerbound of the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) in a\\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space, and thus can be used to train GANs. CKGAN\\nmitigates the notorious problem of mode collapse by mapping the generated\\nimages back to random noise. To save the effort of selecting the kernel\\nfunction manually, we propose a soft selection method to automatically learn a\\ncharacteristic kernel function. The experimental evaluation conducted on a set\\nof synthetic and real image benchmarks (MNIST, CelebA, etc.) demonstrates that\\nCKGAN generally outperforms other MMD-based GANs. The results also show that at\\nthe cost of moderately more training time, the automatically selected kernel\\nfunction delivers very close performance to the best of manually fine-tuned one\\non real image benchmarks and is able to improve the performances of other\\nMMD-based GANs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T11:58:56Z\"}"}
