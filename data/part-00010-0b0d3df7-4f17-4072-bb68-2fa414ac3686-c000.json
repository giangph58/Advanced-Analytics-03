Through exact diagonalization for small systems\\nand tensor-network methods for larger chains, we demonstrate that the\\nsteady-state current remains finite and decays exponentially with disorder\\nstrength, showing no evidence of a transition up to disorder values far beyond\\nthe previously claimed critical point. Our results reveal a stark discrepancy\\nbetween spectral indicators, which suggest localization, and transport\\nbehavior, which indicates delocalization. This highlights the importance of\\ndynamical observables in characterizing NH MBL and suggests that traditional\\nspectral measures may not fully capture the physics of non-Hermitian systems.\\n  Additionally, we observe a non-commutativity of limits in system size and\\ntime, further complicating the interpretation of finite-size studies. These\\nfindings challenge the existence of NH MBL in the studied model and underscore\\nthe need for alternative approaches to understand localization in non-Hermitian\\nsettings.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn,cond-mat.stat-mech,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T10:24:39Z\"}"}
