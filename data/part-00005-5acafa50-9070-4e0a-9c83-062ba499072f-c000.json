{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04774v1\", \"title\": \"BayesCPF: Enabling Collective Perception in Robot Swarms with Degrading\\n  Sensors\", \"summary\": \"The collective perception problem -- where a group of robots perceives its\\nsurroundings and comes to a consensus on an environmental state -- is a\\nfundamental problem in swarm robotics. Past works studying collective\\nperception use either an entire robot swarm with perfect sensing or a swarm\\nwith only a handful of malfunctioning members. A related study proposed an\\nalgorithm that does account for an entire swarm of unreliable robots but\\nassumes that the sensor faults are known and remain constant over time. To that\\nend, we build on that study by proposing the Bayes Collective Perception Filter\\n(BayesCPF) that enables robots with continuously degrading sensors to\\naccurately estimate the fill ratio -- the rate at which an environmental\\nfeature occurs. Our main contribution is the Extended Kalman Filter within the\\nBayesCPF, which helps swarm robots calibrate for their time-varying sensor\\ndegradation. We validate our method across different degradation models,\\ninitial conditions, and environments in simulated and physical experiments. Our\\nfindings show that, regardless of degradation model assumptions, fill ratio\\nestimation using the BayesCPF is competitive to the case if the true sensor\\naccuracy is known, especially when assumptions regarding the model and initial\\nsensor accuracy levels are preserved.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T07:06:11Z\"}"}
