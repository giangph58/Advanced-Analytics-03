This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of artificial intelligence\\n(AI) in diagnosing DR. The method employed is the Synthetic Minority\\nOver-sampling Technique (SMOTE) algorithm, applied to identify DR and its\\nseverity stages from fundus images using the public dataset \\\"APTOS 2019\\nBlindness Detection.\\\" Literature was reviewed via ScienceDirect, ResearchGate,\\nGoogle Scholar, and IEEE Xplore. Classification results using Convolutional\\nNeural Network (CNN) showed the best performance for the binary classes normal\\n(0) and DR (1) with an accuracy of 99.55%, precision of 99.54%, recall of\\n99.54%, and F1-score of 99.54%. For the multiclass classification No_DR (0),\\nMild (1), Moderate (2), Severe (3), Proliferate_DR (4), the accuracy was\\n95.26%, precision 95.26%, recall 95.17%, and F1-score 95.23%. Evaluation using\\nthe confusion matrix yielded results of 99.68% for binary classification and\\n96.65% for multiclass. This study highlights the significant potential in\\nenhancing the accuracy of DR diagnosis compared to traditional human analysis\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.CV,cs.LG,q-bio.NC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T05:38:53Z\"}"}
