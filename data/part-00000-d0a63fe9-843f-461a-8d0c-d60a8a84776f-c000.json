{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02582v1\", \"title\": \"Ambiguity Function Analysis of Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing\\n  for Integrated Sensing and Communication\", \"summary\": \"Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is a chirp-based multicarrier\\nwaveform that was recently proposed for communication over doubly dispersive\\nchannels. Given its chirp nature, AFDM is expected to have superior sensing\\ncapabilities compared to orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and\\nis thus a promising candidate for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)\\napplications. In this paper, we derive a closed-form expression for the\\nambiguity function of AFDM waveforms modulated with $M$-ary quadrature\\namplitude modulation (QAM) data symbols. We determine the condition on the\\nchirp rate of the AFDM waveform that minimizes the sidelobes in the delay/range\\ndomain in the presence of random $M$-ary QAM symbols, thereby improving overall\\nsensing performance. Additionally, we find an approximate statistical\\ndistribution for the magnitude of the derived ambiguity function. Simulation\\nresults are presented to evaluate the sensing performance of the AFDM waveform\\nfor various system parameters and to compare its peak-to-sidelobe ratio (PSLR)\\nand integrated sidelobe ratio (ISLR) with those of OFDM.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T13:46:42Z\"}"}
