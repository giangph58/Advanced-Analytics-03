This secondary emission property enables felines to be highly\\nsensitive to light, possessing remarkable visual capabilities even in dark\\nsettings. Drawing inspiration from this natural phenomenon, we propose an\\nactive-passive-composite sub-terahertz meta-imager integrated with a bifocus\\nmetasurface, a high-sensitivity radiometer, and a low-power signal hidden\\nradiation source. Benefiting from its aperture-shared advantage, this advanced\\nfusion imaging system, enabled to be deployed by a simplified portable hardware\\nplatform, allows for the concurrent acquisition of active and passive\\nelectromagnetic properties to extend the target detection category and realize\\nmulti-mode fusion perception. Notably, it also enables the extraction of\\nradiation and reflection characteristics without additional calibration\\nmodules. Experiments demonstrate the multi-target fusion imaging and localized\\ninformation decoupling with the tailored field of view and emission energy.\\nThis compact and multi-mode fusion imaging system may have plenty of potential\\nfor airplane navigation positioning, abnormal monitoring, and non-interactive\\nconcealed security checks.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:27:25Z\"}"}
