{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05767v1\", \"title\": \"Cross-Document Contextual Coreference Resolution in Knowledge Graphs\", \"summary\": \"Coreference resolution across multiple documents poses a significant\\nchallenge in natural language processing, particularly within the domain of\\nknowledge graphs. This study introduces an innovative method aimed at\\nidentifying and resolving references to the same entities that appear across\\ndiffering texts, thus enhancing the coherence and collaboration of information.\\nOur method employs a dynamic linking mechanism that associates entities in the\\nknowledge graph with their corresponding textual mentions. By utilizing\\ncontextual embeddings along with graph-based inference strategies, we\\neffectively capture the relationships and interactions among entities, thereby\\nimproving the accuracy of coreference resolution. Rigorous evaluations on\\nvarious benchmark datasets highlight notable advancements in our approach over\\ntraditional methodologies. The results showcase how the contextual information\\nderived from knowledge graphs enhances the understanding of complex\\nrelationships across documents, leading to better entity linking and\\ninformation extraction capabilities in applications driven by knowledge. Our\\ntechnique demonstrates substantial improvements in both precision and recall,\\nunderscoring its effectiveness in the area of cross-document coreference\\nresolution.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.MA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T07:47:07Z\"}"}
