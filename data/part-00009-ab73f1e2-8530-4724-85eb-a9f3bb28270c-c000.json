It turns out that strong relation is\\nan equivalence relation. We study some of the characterizations of these\\nrelations. Given a non-zero element in a normed space, we construct an\\nextensible cone which makes that normed space, an ordered normed space. This\\nextensible cone induces the weak relation in the normed space. Later, we prove\\na Jordan Decomposition Theorem in a normed space by the weak relation induced\\nby the extensible cone.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T09:33:41Z\"}"}
