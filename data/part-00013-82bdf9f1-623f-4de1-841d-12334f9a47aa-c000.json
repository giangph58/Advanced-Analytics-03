We attempt to ameliorate this issue by using data\\naugmentation methods to increase corpus size, comparing augmentation to\\nhyperparameter tuning for multilingual forced alignment. Unlike text\\naugmentation methods, audio augmentation does not lead to substantially\\nincreased performance. Hyperparameter tuning, on the other hand, results in\\nsubstantial improvement without (for this amount of data) infeasible additional\\ntraining time. For languages with small to medium amounts of training data,\\nthis is a workable alternative to adapting models from high-resource languages.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T16:38:45Z\"}"}
