{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06558v1\", \"title\": \"Giant Rashba splitting in PtTe/PtTe$_2$ heterostructure\", \"summary\": \"Achieving a large spin splitting is highly desirable for spintronic devices,\\nwhich often requires breaking of the inversion symmetry. However, many\\natomically thin films are centrosymmetric, making them unsuitable for\\nspintronic applications. Here, we report a strategy to achieve inversion\\nsymmetry breaking from a centrosymmetric transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC)\\nbilayer PtTe$_2$, leading to a giant Rashba spin splitting. Specifically, the\\nthermal annealing turns one layer of PtTe$_2$ sample into a transition metal\\nmonochalcogenide (TMMC) PtTe through Te extraction, thus forming PtTe/PtTe$_2$\\nheterostructure with inversion symmetry breaking. In the naturally-formed\\nPtTe/PtTe$_2$ heterostructure, we observe a giant Rashba spin splitting with\\nRashba coefficient of $\\\\alpha_{R}$ = 1.8 eV$\\\\cdot$$\\\\AA$, as revealed by spin-\\nand angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. Our work\\ndemonstrates a convenient and effective pathway for achieving pronounced Rashba\\nsplitting in centrosymmetric TMDC thin films by creating TMMC/TMDC\\nheterostructure, thereby extending their potential applications to spintronics.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T03:44:44Z\"}"}
