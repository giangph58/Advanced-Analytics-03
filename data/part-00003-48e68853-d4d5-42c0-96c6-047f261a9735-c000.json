We jointly use the reflection model \\\\texttt{relxillcp} and the\\ngeneral relativistic thermal thin disk model \\\\texttt{kerrbb} to fit the spectra\\nfrom 2 - 100 keV. By jointly fitting the five spectra, we constrained the black\\nhole mass to be $M=5.8\\\\pm 0.3 M_{\\\\odot}$ and dimensionless spin parameter to be\\n$a_{*}=0.88^{+0.01}_{-0.02}$ (90 percent statistical confidence). The\\nreflection model shows that SLX 1746-331 is a high-inclination system with the\\ninclination angle $i=63.7^{+1.3}_{-1.0}$ degrees, the accretion disk has a\\ndensity $\\\\rm{log}N\\\\sim 16 ~\\\\rm cm^{-3}$. In addition, with the different\\nreflection model \\\\texttt{relxilllp}, which assumes a lamp-post geometry corona,\\nwe still give similar results.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T06:14:48Z\"}"}
