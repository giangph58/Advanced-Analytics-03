Defined in terms of the maximal\\nnumber of tropically independent elements within the semimodule, this quantity\\nhas remained elusive due to the challenges of computing it in practice. In this\\nnote, we establish that the tropical rank is, in fact, precisely equal to the\\ntopological dimension of the semimodule, one more than the dimension of the\\nassociated linear system of divisors. Moreover, we show that the equality of\\ndivisorial and tropical ranks in the definition of tropical linear series is\\nequivalent to the pure dimensionality of the corresponding linear system. We\\nconclude with complementary results and questions on combinatorial and\\ntopological properties of the tropical rank.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG,math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:54:55Z\"}"}
