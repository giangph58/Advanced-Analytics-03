While this conjecture is false for even $n$,\\nBeck has proved that $\\\\|\\\\sigma\\\\|_2 \\\\leq \\\\sqrt{2}$ always holds with probability\\n$\\\\Omega(1/n)$. Recently, He, Ju\\\\v{s}kevi\\\\v{c}ius, Narayanan, and Spiro\\nconjectured that the Erd\\\\H{o}s' conjecture holds when $n$ is odd. We disprove\\nthis conjecture by exhibiting vectors $v_1, \\\\dotsc, v_n$ for which\\n$\\\\|\\\\sigma\\\\|_2 \\\\leq 1$ occurs with probability $O(1/n^{3/2})$. On the other\\nhand, an approximated version of their conjecture holds: we show that we always\\nhave $\\\\|\\\\sigma\\\\|_2 \\\\leq 1 + \\\\delta$ with probability $\\\\Omega_\\\\delta(1/n)$, for\\nall $\\\\delta > 0$. This shows that when $n$ is odd, the minimum probability that\\n$\\\\|\\\\sigma\\\\|_2 \\\\leq r$ exhibits a double-jump phase transition at $r = 1$, as we\\ncan also show that $\\\\|\\\\sigma\\\\|_2 \\\\leq 1$ occurs with probability at least\\n$\\\\Omega((1/2+\\\\mu)^n)$ for some $\\\\mu > 0$. Additionally, and using a different\\nconstruction, we give a negative answer to a question of Beck and two other\\nquestions of He, Ju\\\\v{s}kevi\\\\v{c}ius, Narayanan, and Spiro, concerning the\\noptimal constructions minimising the probability that $\\\\|\\\\sigma\\\\|_2 \\\\leq\\n\\\\sqrt{2}$. We also make some progress on the higher dimensional versions of\\nthese questions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:20:49Z\"}"}
