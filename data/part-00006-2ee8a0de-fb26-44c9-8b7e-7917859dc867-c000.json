We give some relation\\nbetween the v-number of the Stanley-Reisner ideal and the Serre-depth of the\\nquotient ring of the second symbolic power of the Stanley-Reisner ideal of its\\nAlexander dual. We also show that the v-number of the Stanley-Reisner ideal of\\na 2-pure simplicial complex is equal to the dimension of its Stanley-Reisner\\nring.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AC\", \"categories\": \"math.AC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T08:01:59Z\"}"}
