{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02613v1\", \"title\": \"UAV-Assisted 5G Networks: Mobility-Aware 3D Trajectory Optimization and\\n  Resource Allocation for Dynamic Environments\", \"summary\": \"This paper proposes a framework for robust design of UAV-assisted wireless\\nnetworks that combine 3D trajectory optimization with user mobility prediction\\nto address dynamic resource allocation challenges. We proposed a sparse\\nsecond-order prediction model for real-time user tracking coupled with\\nheuristic user clustering to balance service quality and computational\\ncomplexity. The joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize the\\nminimum rate. It is then decomposed into user association, 3D trajectory\\ndesign, and resource allocation subproblems, which are solved iteratively via\\nsuccessive convex approximation (SCA). Extensive simulations demonstrate: (1)\\nnear-optimal performance with $\\\\epsilon \\\\approx 0.67\\\\%$ deviation from\\nupper-bound solutions, (2) $16\\\\%$ higher minimum rates for distant users\\ncompared to non-predictive 3D designs, and (3) $10-30\\\\%$ faster outage\\nmitigation than time-division benchmarks. The framework's adaptive speed\\ncontrol enables precise mobile user tracking while maintaining energy\\nefficiency under constrained flight time. Results demonstrate superior\\nrobustness in edge-coverage scenarios, making it particularly suitable for\\n$5G/6G$ networks.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:12:58Z\"}"}
