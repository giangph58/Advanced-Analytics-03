{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01620v1\", \"title\": \"A Conic Transformation Approach for Solving the Perspective-Three-Point\\n  Problem\", \"summary\": \"We propose a conic transformation method to solve the Perspective-Three-Point\\n(P3P) problem. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art solvers, which\\nformulate the P3P problem by intersecting two conics and constructing a\\ndegenerate conic to find the intersection, our approach builds upon a new\\nformulation based on a transformation that maps the two conics to a new\\ncoordinate system, where one of the conics becomes a standard parabola in a\\ncanonical form. This enables expressing one variable in terms of the other\\nvariable, and as a consequence, substantially simplifies the problem of finding\\nthe conic intersection. Moreover, the polynomial coefficients are fast to\\ncompute, and we only need to determine the real-valued intersection points,\\nwhich avoids the requirement of using computationally expensive complex\\narithmetic. While the current state-of-the-art methods reduce the conic\\nintersection problem to solving a univariate cubic equation, our approach,\\ndespite resulting in a quartic equation, is still faster thanks to this new\\nsimplified formulation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method\\nachieves higher speed while maintaining robustness and stability comparable to\\nstate-of-the-art methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:27:47Z\"}"}
