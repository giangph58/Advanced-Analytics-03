{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24378v1\", \"title\": \"ACPBench Hard: Unrestrained Reasoning about Action, Change, and Planning\", \"summary\": \"The ACPBench dataset provides atomic reasoning tasks required for efficient\\nplanning. The dataset is aimed at distilling the complex plan generation task\\ninto separate atomic reasoning tasks in their easiest possible form, boolean or\\nmultiple-choice questions, where the model has to choose the right answer from\\nthe provided options. While the aim of ACPBench is to test the simplest form of\\nreasoning about action and change, when tasked with planning, a model does not\\ntypically have options to choose from and thus the reasoning required for\\nplanning dictates an open-ended, generative form for these tasks. To that end,\\nwe introduce ACPBench Hard, a generative version of ACPBench, with open-ended\\nquestions which the model needs to answer. Models that perform well on these\\ntasks could in principle be integrated into a planner or be used directly as a\\npolicy. We discuss the complexity of these tasks as well as the complexity of\\nvalidating the correctness of their answers and present validation algorithms\\nfor each task. Equipped with these validators, we test the performance of a\\nvariety of models on our tasks and find that for most of these tasks the\\nperformance of even the largest models is still subpar. Our experiments show\\nthat no model outperforms another in these tasks and with a few exceptions all\\ntested language models score below 65%, indicating that even the current\\nfrontier language models have a long way to go before they can reliably reason\\nabout planning. In fact, even the so-called reasoning models struggle with\\nsolving these reasoning tasks.
