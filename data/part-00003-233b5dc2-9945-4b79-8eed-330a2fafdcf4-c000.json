By mapping the Q1D system onto a one-dimensional polydisperse mixture\\nof nonadditive hard rods, we obtain exact thermodynamic and structural\\nproperties, including the radial distribution function, which had remained\\nelusive in previous studies. We derive analytical expressions for limiting\\ncases, such as small pore diameters, virial coefficients, and extreme\\npressures. Additionally, we identify a transition in the anisotropic pressure\\ncomponents, where the transverse pressure surpasses the longitudinal one at\\nhigh densities if the pore diameter exceeds a critical threshold. Finally, we\\nanalyze spatial correlations in particle arrangements and fluctuations in\\nradial positioning, providing insight into the emergence of ordering in\\nconfined systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,cond-mat.stat-mech,physics.class-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T07:32:49Z\"}"}
