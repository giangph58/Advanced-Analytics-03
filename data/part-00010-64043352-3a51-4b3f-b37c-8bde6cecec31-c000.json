{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06561v1\", \"title\": \"A Streamable Neural Audio Codec with Residual Scalar-Vector Quantization\\n  for Real-Time Communication\", \"summary\": \"This paper proposes StreamCodec, a streamable neural audio codec designed for\\nreal-time communication. StreamCodec adopts a fully causal, symmetric\\nencoder-decoder structure and operates in the modified discrete cosine\\ntransform (MDCT) domain, aiming for low-latency inference and real-time\\nefficient generation. To improve codebook utilization efficiency and compensate\\nfor the audio quality loss caused by structural causality, StreamCodec\\nintroduces a novel residual scalar-vector quantizer (RSVQ). The RSVQ\\nsequentially connects scalar quantizers and improved vector quantizers in a\\nresidual manner, constructing coarse audio contours and refining acoustic\\ndetails, respectively. Experimental results confirm that the proposed\\nStreamCodec achieves decoded audio quality comparable to advanced\\nnon-streamable neural audio codecs. Specifically, on the 16 kHz LibriTTS\\ndataset, StreamCodec attains a ViSQOL score of 4.30 at 1.5 kbps. It has a fixed\\nlatency of only 20 ms and achieves a generation speed nearly 20 times real-time\\non a CPU, with a lightweight model size of just 7M parameters, making it highly\\nsuitable for real-time communication applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SD\", \"categories\": \"cs.SD\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T03:49:00Z\"}"}
