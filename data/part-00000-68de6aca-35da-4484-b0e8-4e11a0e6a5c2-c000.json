A new thermodynamic state function is introduced to describe the mean\\ntransverse momentum fluctuations of charged particles in heavy-ion collisions,\\nenabling analytic expressions for the temperature fluctuations of different\\norders. This formalism is applied to the QCD thermodynamics described by a 2+1\\nflavor low energy effective field theory within the functional renormalization\\ngroup approach. It is found that the temperature fluctuations are suppressed\\nremarkably as the matter is evolved from the phase of hadron resonance gas to\\nthe quark-gluon plasma phase with increasing temperature or baryon chemical\\npotential, which is attributed to the significant increase of the heat capacity\\nof matter. Furthermore, the same mechanism leads to a negative skewness in the\\ntemperature fluctuations.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:42:59Z\"}"}
