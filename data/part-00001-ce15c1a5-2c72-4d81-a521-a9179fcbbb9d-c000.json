Despite its success, the integration of TDA with\\ntime-series prediction remains underexplored due to three primary challenges:\\nthe limited utilization of temporal dependencies within topological features,\\ncomputational bottlenecks associated with persistent homology, and the\\ndeterministic nature of TDA pipelines restricting generalized feature learning.\\nThis study addresses these challenges by proposing the Topological Information\\nSupervised (TIS) Prediction framework, which leverages neural networks and\\nConditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) to generate synthetic\\ntopological features, preserving their distribution while significantly\\nreducing computational time. We propose a novel training strategy that\\nintegrates topological consistency loss to improve the predictive accuracy of\\ndeep learning models. Specifically, we introduce two state-of-the-art models,\\nTIS-BiGRU and TIS-Informer, designed to capture short-term and long-term\\ntemporal dependencies, respectively. Comparative experimental results\\ndemonstrate the superior performance of TIS models over conventional\\npredictors, validating the effectiveness of integrating topological\\ninformation. This work not only advances TDA-based time-series prediction but\\nalso opens new avenues for utilizing topological features in deep learning\\narchitectures.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T06:16:19Z\"}"}
