{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06126v1\", \"title\": \"Accelerating Vehicle Routing via AI-Initialized Genetic Algorithms\", \"summary\": \"Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) are an extension of the Traveling Salesperson\\nProblem and are a fundamental NP-hard challenge in combinatorial optimization.\\nSolving VRP in real-time at large scale has become critical in numerous\\napplications, from growing markets like last-mile delivery to emerging\\nuse-cases like interactive logistics planning. Such applications involve\\nsolving similar problem instances repeatedly, yet current state-of-the-art\\nsolvers treat each instance on its own without leveraging previous examples. We\\nintroduce a novel optimization framework that uses a reinforcement learning\\nagent - trained on prior instances - to quickly generate initial solutions,\\nwhich are then further optimized by genetic algorithms. Our framework,\\nEvolutionary Algorithm with Reinforcement Learning Initialization (EARLI),\\nconsistently outperforms current state-of-the-art solvers across various time\\nscales. For example, EARLI handles vehicle routing with 500 locations within\\n1s, 10x faster than current solvers for the same solution quality, enabling\\napplications like real-time and interactive routing. EARLI can generalize to\\nnew data, as demonstrated on real e-commerce delivery data of a previously\\nunseen city. Our hybrid framework presents a new way to combine reinforcement\\nlearning and genetic algorithms, paving the road for closer interdisciplinary\\ncollaboration between AI and optimization communities towards real-time\\noptimization in diverse domains.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.NE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T15:21:01Z\"}"}
