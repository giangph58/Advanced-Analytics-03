This approach efficiently simulates non-Gaussian CV systems by\\nleveraging their functional form. By addressing scaling bottlenecks, FMPS\\nenables more efficient simulation of shallow, multi-mode CV quantum circuits\\nwith non-Gaussian input states. The method is validated by simulating random\\nshallow and cascaded circuits with highly non-Gaussian input states, showing\\nsuperior performance compared to existing techniques, also in the presence of\\nloss.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:37:19Z\"}"}
