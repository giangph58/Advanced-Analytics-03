In this work, we present several alternative methods based on machine\\nlearning methods (LSTM, xLSTM, Transformer, XGBoost, and ConvLSTM) to predict\\nthe final consensus value based on directed networks (Erd\\\\\\\"os-Renyi,\\nWatts-Strogatz, and Barab\\\\'asi-Albert) and on the initial state. We highlight\\nhow different k-hop interactions affect the performance of the tested methods.\\nThis framework opens new avenues for analyzing multi-scale diffusion processes\\nin large-scale, complex networks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SI\", \"categories\": \"cs.SI,cs.MA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:53:57Z\"}"}
