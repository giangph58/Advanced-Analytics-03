{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24226v1\", \"title\": \"Asymptotic Freedom and Finite-size Scaling of Two-dimensional Classical\\n  Heisenberg Model\", \"summary\": \"The classical Heisenberg model is one of the most fundamental models in\\nstatistical and condensed matter physics. Extensive theoretical and numerical\\nstudies suggest that, in two dimensions, this model does not exhibit a\\nfinite-temperature phase transition but instead manifests asymptotic freedom.\\nHowever, some research has also proposed the possibility of a\\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition over the years. In this\\nstudy, we revisit the classical two-dimensional (2D) Heisenberg model through\\nlarge-scale simulations with linear system sizes up to $L=16384$. Our\\nMonte-Carlo data, without any extrapolation, clearly reveal an exponential\\ndivergence of the correlation length $\\\\xi$ as a function of inverse temperature\\n$\\\\beta$, a hallmark of asymptotic freedom. Moreover, extrapolating $\\\\xi$ to the\\nthermodynamic limit in the low-temperature regime achieves close agreement with\\nthe three-loop perturbative calculations. We further propose a finite-size\\nscaling (FSS) ansatz for $\\\\xi$, demonstrating that the pseudo-critical point\\n$\\\\beta_L$ diverges logarithmically with $L$. The thermodynamic and finite-size\\nscaling behaviors of the magnetic susceptibility $\\\\chi$ are also investigated\\nand corroborate the prediction of asymptotic freedom. Our work provides solid\\nevidence for asymptotic freedom in the 2D Heisenberg model and advances\\nunderstanding of finite-size scaling in such systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:39:13Z\"}"}
