In this work, we introduce a unified\\ntheoretical model to describe the propagation of OPBs and present comprehensive\\nsimulation results based on many realizations and link-budget analyses for\\nconstant turbulence strengths. For reference, we compare the performance of the\\nOPBs to weakly diverging and focusing Gaussian beams. For a 100km long\\nair-to-air link, 10km above sea level, our simulation results show that OPBs\\noffer an improved link budget of up to 8.6dB and enhanced beam wander\\nstatistics of up to 3dB compared to the considered Gaussian beams.\\nAdditionally, we identified a quadratic relationship between the transmitter\\naperture diameter and the maximum achievable distances, which is crucial in\\ndeciding the suitability of OPBs for a given application scenario.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,physics.ao-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T13:07:13Z\"}"}
