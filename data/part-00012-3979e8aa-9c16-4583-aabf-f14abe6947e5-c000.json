However, current host-level\\nintrusion detection systems (IDS) lack the ability to correlate alerts and\\ncoordinate a network-wide response in real time. Motivated by advances in\\nsystem-level extensions free of rebooting and network-wide orchestration of\\nhost actions, we propose using a central IDS orchestrator to remotely program\\nthe logic of each host IDS and collect the alerts generated in real time. In\\nthis paper, we make arguments for such a system concept and provide a high\\nlevel design of the main system components. Furthermore, we have developed a\\nsystem prototype and evaluated it using two experimental scenarios rooted from\\nreal-world attacks. The evaluation results show that the host-based IDS\\norchestration system is able to defend against the attacks effectively.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T17:41:04Z\"}"}
