This method approximates the exterior derivative acting on\\ndifferential forms, thereby providing an approximation of the Hodge Laplacian\\noperator. Hodge Diffusion Maps extend existing non-linear dimensionality\\nreduction techniques, including vector diffusion maps, as well as the theories\\nbehind diffusion maps and Laplacian Eigenmaps. Our approach captures\\nhigher-order topological features of the data-set by projecting it into\\nlower-dimensional Euclidean spaces using the Hodge Laplacian. We develop a\\ntheoretical framework to estimate the approximation error of the exterior\\nderivative, based on sample points distributed over a real manifold. Numerical\\nexperiments support and validate the proposed methodology.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T16:30:13Z\"}"}
