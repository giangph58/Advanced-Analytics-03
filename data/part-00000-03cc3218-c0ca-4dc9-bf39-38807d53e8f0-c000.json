An important\\napproach to controlling and optimizing ultra-intense laser interactions\\ninvolves gathering large data sets and using this data to train statistical and\\nmachine learning models. In this paper we describe experimental efforts to\\naccelerate electrons and protons to $\\\\sim$MeV energies with this goal in mind.\\nThese experiments involve a 1 kHz repetition rate ultra-intense laser system\\nwith $\\\\sim$10mJ per shot, a peak intensity near $5 \\\\times 10^{18}$ W/cm$^{2}$,\\nand a \\\"liquid leaf\\\" target. Improvements to the data acquisition capabilities\\nof this laser system greatly aided this investigation. Generally, we find that\\nthe trained models were very effective for controlling the numbers of MeV\\nelectrons ejected. The models were less successful at shifting the energy range\\nof ejected electrons. Simultaneous control of the numbers of $\\\\sim$MeV\\nelectrons and the energy range will be the subject of future experimentation\\nusing this platform.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:37:23Z\"}"}
