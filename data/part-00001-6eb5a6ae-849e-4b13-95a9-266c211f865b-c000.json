{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02340v1\", \"title\": \"Perturbative Variational Quantum Eigensolver based on Reduced Density\\n  Matrix Method\", \"summary\": \"Current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices lack the quantum\\nresources required for practical applications. To address this, we propose the\\nperturbative variational quantum eigensolver (PT-VQE). In PT-VQE, VQE is used\\nto capture key correlations within a carefully selected active space, while\\nperturbation theory efficiently incorporates interactions in the remaining\\nspace, without requiring additional qubits or circuit depth. When the\\nVQE-optimized state closely approximates the true ground state in the active\\nspace, excitations cannot act solely in the active space, since their\\ncontributions to perturbative correction are negligible. This reduces the\\nhighest-order required RDM from 4-RDM to 3-RDM, significantly reducing\\ncomputational costs. We validate PT-VQE by calculating the ground-state\\npotential energy surfaces (PESs) of $\\\\rm{HF}$ and $\\\\rm{N}_2$, as well as the\\nground-state energy of ferrocene ($\\\\rm{Fe(C_5H_5)_2}$). Additionally, PT-VQE is\\nperformed on a quantum computer to compute the PES of ${\\\\rm F}_2$. The\\nconsistent results obtained from both PT-VQE with the highest 3-RDM and 4-RDM\\nconfirm the reliability of the constraint. PT-VQE significantly outperforms\\nstandard VQE, achieving chemical accuracy. This method offers a\\nresource-efficient and practical approach for accurate quantum simulations of\\nlarger systems.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T07:20:20Z\"}"}
