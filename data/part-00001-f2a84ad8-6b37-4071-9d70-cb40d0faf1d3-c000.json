We prove that the total spaces of log\\nCalabi-Yau fibrations are bounded in codimension one after fixing some natural\\ninvariants. We also prove that the total spaces are bounded if, in addition,\\nthe irregularity of the general fibers vanishes. Then we apply our results to\\nthe boundedness problem for stable minimal models and fibered Calabi-Yau\\nvarieties.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T16:28:38Z\"}"}
