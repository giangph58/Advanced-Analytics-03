{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04725v1\", \"title\": \"Prethermalization in Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chains\", \"summary\": \"The observation of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) paradox, namely the\\nlack of equipartition in the evolution of a normal mode in a nonlinear chain on\\nunexpectedly long times, is arguably the most famous numerical experiment in\\nthe history of physics. Since seventy years after its publication, most studies\\nin FPUT chains still focus on long wavelength initial states similar to the\\noriginal paper. It is shown here that all characteristic features of the FPUT\\nparadox are rendered even more striking if short(er) wavelength modes are\\nevolved instead. Since not every normal mode leads to equipartition, we also\\nprovide a simple technique to predict which modes, and in what order, are\\nexcited starting from an initial mode (root) in $\\\\alpha$-FPUT chains. The\\nexcitation sequences associated with a root are then shown to spread energy at\\ndifferent speeds, leading to prethermalization regimes that become longer as a\\nfunction of mode excitation number. This effect is visible in observables such\\nas mode energies and spectral entropies and, surprisingly, also in the time\\nevolution of invariant quantities such as Lyapunov times and Kolmogorov-Sinai\\nentropies. Our findings generalize the original FPUT experiment, provide an\\noriginal look at the paradox's source, and enrich the vast literature dedicated\\nto studying equipartition in classical many-body systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech,nlin.CD\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T04:36:42Z\"}"}
