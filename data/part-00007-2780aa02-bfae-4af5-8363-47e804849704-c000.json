Self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) are ideal for this goal due to\\ntheir ability to generate highly indistinguishable single photons with\\nexceptional brightness. Integrating QDs into low-loss photonic circuits can\\nfacilitate complex quantum networks by enabling entanglement transfer via\\ntwo-photon interference. However, challenges such as limited scalability,\\nspectral inhomogeneity, and quantum interference between independent sources\\nremain. We present a hybrid photonic architecture that integrates QD-containing\\nwaveguides with low-loss lithium niobate (LN) circuits, incorporating 20\\ndeterministic single-photon sources (SPSs). Using the piezoelectric properties\\nof thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN), we achieve on-chip local spectral tuning\\nof QD emissions by up to 7.7 meV,three orders of magnitude greater than the\\ntransform-limited linewidth. This approach enables on-chip quantum interference\\nwith a visibility of 0.73 between two spatially separated QD SPSs connected by\\n0.48 mm long waveguides, establishing a functional quantum network.The\\nlarge-scale integration of spectrally tunable QD-based SPSs into low-loss LN\\ncircuits, combined with fast electro-optical switching, paves the way for\\ncompact, lightweight, and scalable photonic quantum networks.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T06:10:44Z\"}"}
