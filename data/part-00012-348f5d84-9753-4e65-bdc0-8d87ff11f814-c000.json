Animating Static Gaussian Scenes With Dynamic Weather\\n  Effects\", \"summary\": \"3D Gaussian Splatting has recently enabled fast and photorealistic\\nreconstruction of static 3D scenes. However, introducing dynamic elements that\\ninteract naturally with such static scenes remains challenging. Accordingly, we\\npresent a novel hybrid framework that combines Gaussian-particle\\nrepresentations for incorporating physically-based global weather effects into\\nstatic 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes, correctly handling the interactions of\\ndynamic elements with the static scene. We follow a three-stage process: we\\nfirst map static 3D Gaussians to a particle-based representation. We then\\nintroduce dynamic particles and simulate their motion using the Material Point\\nMethod (MPM). Finally, we map the simulated particles back to the Gaussian\\ndomain while introducing appearance parameters tailored for specific effects.\\nTo correctly handle the interactions of dynamic elements with the static scene,\\nwe introduce specialized collision handling techniques. Our approach supports a\\nvariety of weather effects, including snowfall, rainfall, fog, and sandstorms,\\nand can also support falling objects, all with physically plausible motion and\\nappearance. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms\\nexisting approaches in both visual quality and physical realism.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GR\", \"categories\": \"cs.GR,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T17:51:21Z\"}"}
