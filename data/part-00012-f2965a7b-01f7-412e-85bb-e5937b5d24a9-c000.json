To warm Mars using\\nengineered aerosol, particles released locally must disperse globally. The\\nwinds that transport aerosol respond to the aerosol's radiative forcing,\\nimplying strong radiative-dynamical feedbacks. Using a plume-tracking climate\\nmodel without a water cycle, we investigate radiative-dynamical feedback from\\nsurface release of two particle compositions: graphene (which attenuates UV)\\nand aluminum. Both compositions can give fast global warming of ~30 K. We infer\\nthat 2 liters/second release rate of graphene made from Mars' atmosphere via\\nCO2-electrolysis could double Mars' greenhouse effect (+5 K). Self-lofting\\nhelps particles rise and spread. The Hadley cell strengthens under warming,\\naiding mixing. Warming can be focused in latitude by tuning particle size.\\nWithin our model, Mars radiative-dynamical feedbacks enable engineered-aerosol\\nwarming. Challenges remain, including functionalization, agglomeration,\\ndry-deposition experiments, and modeling water cycle feedbacks.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,physics.geo-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:06:35Z\"}"}
