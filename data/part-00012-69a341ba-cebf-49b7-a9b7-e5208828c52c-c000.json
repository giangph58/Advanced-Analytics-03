{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01716v1\", \"title\": \"Studies of Hadronic Showers in SND@LHC\", \"summary\": \"The SND@LHC experiment was built for observing neutrinos arising from LHC pp\\ncollisions. The detector consists of two sections: a target instrumented with\\nSciFi modules and a hadronic calorimeter/muon detector. Energetic $\\\\nu$N\\ncollisions in the target produce hadronic showers. Reconstruction of the shower\\ntotal energy requires an estimate of the fractions deposited in both the target\\nand the calorimeter. In order to calibrate the SND@LHC response, a replica of\\nthe detector was exposed to hadron beams with 100 to 300 GeV in the CERN SPS H8\\ntest beam line in Summer 2023. This report describes the methods developed to\\ntag the presence of a shower, to locate the shower origin in the target, and to\\ncombine the target SciFi and the calorimeter signals so to measure the shower\\ntotal energy.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T13:25:54Z\"}"}
