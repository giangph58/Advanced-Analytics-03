Our analysis\\nreveals that the chaotic phase of the bare Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian can\\nactually be enhanced by the presence of a moderate tilt. We further unveil the\\ndevelopment and scaling of the chaotic regime from the perspective of a\\nhomogeneous density configuration typically used in cold atom experiments,\\nproviding a valuable phase diagram for future theoretical and experimental\\nstudies of this system.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:18:33Z\"}"}
