Data-driven\\nsolutions face the challenge of high real-world data costs, while simulation\\ndata, despite its low costs, is limited by the sim-to-real gap. We identify the\\nroot cause of gripper state ambiguity as the lack of tactile feedback. To\\naddress this, we propose a novel approach employing pseudo-tactile as feedback,\\ninspired by the idea of using a force-controlled gripper as a tactile sensor.\\nThis method enhances policy robustness without additional data collection and\\nhardware involvement, while providing a noise-free binary gripper state\\nobservation for the policy and thus facilitating pure simulation learning to\\nunleash the power of simulation. Experimental results across three real-world\\ngrasp-based tasks demonstrate the necessity, effectiveness, and efficiency of\\nour approach.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T08:29:17Z\"}"}
