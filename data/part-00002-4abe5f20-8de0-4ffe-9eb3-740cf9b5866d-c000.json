This result is a functional extension of the It\\\\^o-formula for\\nc\\\\`adl\\\\`ag rough paths (by Friz and Zhang (2018)), which coincides with the\\nchange of variable formula formulated by Dupire (2009) whenever the\\nfunctionals' representations, the notions of regularity, and the integration\\nconcepts can be matched. Unlike these previous works, we treat the vertical\\n(jump) pertubation via the Marcus transformation, which allows for\\nincorporating path functionals where the second order vertical derivatives do\\nnot commute, as is the case for typical signature functionals. As a byproduct,\\nwe show that sufficiently regular non-anticipative maps admit a functional\\nTaylor expansion in terms of the path's signature, leading to an important\\ngeneralization of the recent results by Dupire and Tissot-Daguette (2022).\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,math.CA,q-fin.MF\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T16:00:21Z\"}"}
