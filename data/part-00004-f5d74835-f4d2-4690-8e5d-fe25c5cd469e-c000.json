However, a comprehensive picture of its\\nhistorical mean state and variability remains vague due to limitations in\\nmodelling and observing systems. Incorporating observations into models offers\\na viable approach to reconstructing climate history, yet achieving coherent\\nestimates of GMOC has proven challenging due to difficulties in harmonizing\\nocean stratification. Here, we demonstrate that applying multiscale data\\nassimilation scheme that integrates atmospheric and oceanic observations into\\nmultiple coupled models in a dynamically consistent way, the global ocean\\ncurrents and GMOC over the past 80 years are retrieved. While the major\\nhistoric events are printed in variability of the rebuilt GMOC, the timeseries\\nof multisphere 3-dimensional physical variables representing the realistic\\nhistorical evolution enable us to advance understanding of mechanisms of\\nclimate signal propagation cross spheres and give birth to Artificial\\nIntelligence coupled big models, thus advancing the Earth science.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T11:15:03Z\"}"}
