We assume that each\\ndriver has its own origin and destination, and wants to complete its journey in\\nminimal time. We also assume that each driver is able to take rational\\ndecisions at junctions and can change route while moving depending on the\\ntraffic conditions. The main novelty of the model is that vehicles can\\nautomatically and anonymously share information about their position,\\ndestination, and planned path when they are close to each other within a\\ncertain distance. The pieces of information acquired during the journey are\\nused to optimize the route itself. In the limit case of a infinite\\ncommunication range, we recover the classical Reactive User Equilibrium and\\nDynamic User Equilibrium.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:35:37Z\"}"}
