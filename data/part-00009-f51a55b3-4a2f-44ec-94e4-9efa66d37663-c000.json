{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02223v1\", \"title\": \"Motivic homotopy theory with ramification filtrations\", \"summary\": \"The aim of this paper is to connect two important and apparently unrelated\\ntheories: motivic homotopy theory and ramification theory. We construct motivic\\nhomotopy categories over a qcqs base scheme $S$, in which cohomology theories\\nwith ramification filtrations are representable. Every such cohomology theory\\nenjoys basic properties such as the Nisnevich descent, the cube-invariance, the\\nblow-up invariance, the smooth blow-up excision, the Gysin sequence, the\\nprojective bundle formula and the Thom isomorphism. In case $S$ is the spectrum\\nof a perfect field, the cohomology of every reciprocity sheaf is upgraded to a\\ncohomology theory with a ramification filtration represented in our categories.\\nWe also address relations of our theory with other non-$\\\\mathbb{A}^1$-invariant\\nmotivic homotopy theories such as the logarithmic motivic homotopy theory of\\nBinda, Park, and {\\\\O}stv{\\\\ae}r and the theory of motivic spectra of\\nAnnala-Iwasa.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG,math.KT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T02:37:57Z\"}"}
