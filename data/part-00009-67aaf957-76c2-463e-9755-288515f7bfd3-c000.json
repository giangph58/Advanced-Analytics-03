However, with the\\nblooming growth of communication task classes coupled with various task\\nrequirements in future 6G systems, this working pattern is obviously\\nunsustainable. Therefore, identifying a groundbreaking paradigm that enables a\\nuniversal model to solve multiple tasks in the physical layer within diverse\\nscenarios is crucial for future system evolution. This paper aims to\\nfundamentally address the curse of ML model generalization across diverse\\nscenarios and tasks by unleashing multi-modal feature integration capabilities\\nin future systems. Given the universality of electromagnetic propagation\\ntheory, the communication process is determined by the scattering environment,\\nwhich can be more comprehensively characterized by cross-modal perception, thus\\nproviding sufficient information for all communication tasks across varied\\nenvironments. This fact motivates us to propose a transformative two-stage\\nmulti-modal pre-training and downstream task adaptation paradigm...\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T07:43:03Z\"}"}
