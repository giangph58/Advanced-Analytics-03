Among these \\\"greedy convolutions\\\" the unitary\\nconvolution and the \\\"ternary convolution\\\" are particularly interesting: they\\nare the only regular, homogeneous convolutions where each primitive number have\\nthe same finite rank. While the greedy convolution of length 3, also described\\nin detail, has primitive numbers of rank 3 and rank 1, it is still special in\\nthat the set of primitives can be generated by a simple recursive procedure\\nthat we name selective sifting.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T17:41:11Z\"}"}
