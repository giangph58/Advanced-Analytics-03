In this\\npaper, we introduce a novel method for automatically generating continuous,\\nrealistic crowd trajectories with heterogeneous behaviors and interactions\\namong individuals. We first design a crowd emitter model. To do this, we obtain\\nspatial layouts from single input images, including a segmentation map,\\nappearance map, population density map and population probability, prior to\\ncrowd generation. The emitter then continually places individuals on the\\ntimeline by assigning independent behavior characteristics such as agents'\\ntype, pace, and start/end positions using diffusion models. Next, our crowd\\nsimulator produces their long-term locomotions. To simulate diverse actions, it\\ncan augment their behaviors based on a Markov chain. As a result, our overall\\nframework populates the scenes with heterogeneous crowd behaviors by\\nalternating between the proposed emitter and simulator. Note that all the\\ncomponents in the proposed framework are user-controllable. Lastly, we propose\\na benchmark protocol to evaluate the realism and quality of the generated\\ncrowds in terms of the scene-level population dynamics and the individual-level\\ntrajectory accuracy. We demonstrate that our approach effectively models\\ndiverse crowd behavior patterns and generalizes well across different\\ngeographical environments.
