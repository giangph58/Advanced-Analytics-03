In\\nthis thesis, however, I argue that medical ML systems are more likely to\\nnegatively impact these relationships than to improve them. In particular, I\\nargue that the use of medical ML systems is likely to comprise the quality of\\ntrust, care, empathy, understanding, and communication between clinicians and\\npatients.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY,cs.AI,cs.HC,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:03:40Z\"}"}
