Supported by analytical micromagnetic theory, we\\nintroduce the field-dependent scaling length $l_{\\\\mathrm{C}}(H)$, which\\ndescribes the characteristic long-wavelength magnetization fluctuations that\\nare caused by microstructural defects by means of magnetoelastic and\\nmagnetocrystalline anisotropy. The scaling length $l_{\\\\mathrm{C}}$ is\\nidentified to consist of the micromagnetic exchange length of the field\\n$l_{\\\\mathrm{H}}$, which depends on the magnetic interactions, and a\\nfield-independent contribution that reflects the properties of the magnetic\\nanisotropy field and the magnetostatic fluctuations. The latter finding is\\nrooted in the convolution relationship between the grain microstructure and\\nmicromagnetic response functions. We validated the scaling property by\\nanalyzing experimental data for the magnetic neutron scattering cross section.\\nWhen plotted as a function of the dimensionless scaled scattering vector\\n$\\\\mathfrak{q}(H) = q \\\\, l_{\\\\mathrm{C}}(H)$, the field-dependent\\namplitude-scaled neutron data of nanocrystalline Co and a Nd-Fe-B-based\\nnanocomposite collapse onto a single master curve, demonstrating universal\\nbehavior. The scaling length $l_{\\\\mathrm{C}}$ provides a framework for\\nanalyzing the field-dependent neutron scattering cross section, highlighting\\nthe existence of critical length scales that govern the mesoscale\\nmicrostructure of magnetic materials.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:11:12Z\"}"}
