The power divider has achieved acceptable results for\\nimportant parameters such as S11, S12, S21, and S22. The substrate employed for\\nthe power divider is Roger 3003 which has a thickness of 1.6 mm. This power\\ndivider provides a reflection coefficient of -12.2 dB and an insertion loss of\\n3.1 dB at 28 GHz. This ka-band T-junction power divider covers 68% of the\\nbandwidth. Dimensions of the ka-band T-junction power divider are 50x80 mm. Due\\nto its dimensions and bandwidth this power divider is more suitable for\\nmillimetre wave applications like RADAR, beamforming, and 5G applications.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY,eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T10:20:05Z\"}"}
