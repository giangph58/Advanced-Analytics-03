{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02362v1\", \"title\": \"Brightness Perceiving for Recursive Low-Light Image Enhancement\", \"summary\": \"Due to the wide dynamic range in real low-light scenes, there will be large\\ndifferences in the degree of contrast degradation and detail blurring of\\ncaptured images, making it difficult for existing end-to-end methods to enhance\\nlow-light images to normal exposure. To address the above issue, we decompose\\nlow-light image enhancement into a recursive enhancement task and propose a\\nbrightness-perceiving-based recursive enhancement framework for high dynamic\\nrange low-light image enhancement. Specifically, our recursive enhancement\\nframework consists of two parallel sub-networks: Adaptive Contrast and Texture\\nenhancement network (ACT-Net) and Brightness Perception network (BP-Net). The\\nACT-Net is proposed to adaptively enhance image contrast and details under the\\nguidance of the brightness adjustment branch and gradient adjustment branch,\\nwhich are proposed to perceive the degradation degree of contrast and details\\nin low-light images. To adaptively enhance images captured under different\\nbrightness levels, BP-Net is proposed to control the recursive enhancement\\ntimes of ACT-Net by exploring the image brightness distribution properties.\\nFinally, in order to coordinate ACT-Net and BP-Net, we design a novel\\nunsupervised training strategy to facilitate the training procedure. To further\\nvalidate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we construct a new dataset\\nwith a broader brightness distribution by mixing three low-light datasets.\\nCompared with eleven existing representative methods, the proposed method\\nachieves new SOTA performance on six reference and no reference metrics.\\nSpecifically, the proposed method improves the PSNR by 0.9 dB compared to the\\nexisting SOTA method.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,eess.IV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T07:53:33Z\"}"}
