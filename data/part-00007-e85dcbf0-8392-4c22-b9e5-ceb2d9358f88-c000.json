{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06262v1\", \"title\": \"Paraxial fluids of light\", \"summary\": \"Paraxial fluids of light are a promising platform for exploring collective\\nphenomena in a highly tunable environment. These systems, which map the\\npropagation of light through nonlinear media onto the wavefunction of effective\\n2D quantum fluids, offer a complementary approach to traditional platforms such\\nas cold atomic gases or superfluid helium. In this review, we present a\\ndetailed overview of the theoretical framework underlying paraxial fluids of\\nlight, including the nonlinear Schr\\\\\\\"odinger equation (NLSE) and its mapping to\\nthe 2D+1 Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). We explore the hydrodynamic\\nformulation of these systems and we provide a comparative analysis of fluids of\\nlight and cold atomic gases, examining key parameters and figures of merit.\\n  We then review the recent experimental advances and the experimental\\nplatforms currently used to realize paraxial fluids of light, including hot\\natomic vapors, photorefractive crystals, and thermo-optic media. Additionally,\\nwe question the geometry of the system extending the analogy from 2D+1 to lower\\nor higher dimensions.\\n  Looking forward, we outline the potential future directions for the field,\\nincluding the use of laser cooled atoms as nonlinear media, the study of\\ntwo-component mixtures, and the exploration of quantum effects beyond the\\nmean-field approximation. These developments promise to deepen our\\nunderstanding of quantum fluids and potentially contribute to advances in\\nquantum technologies.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T17:59:42Z\"}"}
