As the\\nimpact parameter approaches its critical value, the deflection angle exhibits a\\nlogarithmic divergence. This divergence is characterized by a logarithmic rate\\nand a constant offset, which we express in terms of coordinate-invariant\\ncurvature evaluated at the unstable photon circular orbit. The curvature\\ncontribution is encoded in the electric part of the Weyl tensor, reflecting\\ntidal effects, and the matter contribution is encoded in the Einstein tensor,\\ncapturing the influence of local energy and pressure. We also express these\\ncoefficients using Newman--Penrose scalars. By exploiting the relationship\\nbetween the strong deflection limit and quasinormal modes, we derive a new\\nexpression for the quasinormal mode frequency in the eikonal limit in terms of\\nthe curvature scalars. Our results provide a unified and coordinate-invariant\\nframework that connects observable lensing features and quasinormal modes to\\nthe local geometry and matter distribution near compact objects.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.HE,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T16:28:45Z\"}"}
