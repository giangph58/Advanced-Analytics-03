Meanwhile,\\nmotivated by the advantages of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) in\\nmitigating multi-user interference (MUI) to enhance the communication rate,\\nthis paper investigates the design problem of joint waveform and passive\\nbeamforming with PAPR constraint for integrated sensing and communication\\n(ISAC) systems, where RIS is deployed for downlink communication. We first\\nconstruct a trade-off optimization problem for the MUI and beampattern\\nsimilarity under PAPR constraint. Then, in order to solve this multivariate\\nproblem, an iterative optimization algorithm based on alternating direction\\nmethod of multipliers (ADMM) and manifold optimization is proposed. Finally,\\nthe simulation results show that the designed waveforms can well satisfy the\\nPAPR requirement of the ISAC systems and achieve a trade-off between radar and\\ncommunication performance. Under high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions,\\ncompared to systems without RIS, RIS-aided ISAC systems have a performance\\nimprovement of about 50\\\\% in communication rate and at least 1 dB in\\nbeampatterning error.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T04:18:23Z\"}"}
