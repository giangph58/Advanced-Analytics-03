We show that, depending on the scaling of $\\\\alpha$, the mixing\\ntime of the random walk on this graph can exhibit three different behaviors,\\nwhich we refer to as subcritical, critical and supercritical. In the\\nsubcritical regime, the total variation distance to equilibrium decays\\nabruptly, providing the occurrence of the so-called cutoff phenomenon. In the\\nsupercritical regime, the mixing is governed by the inter-community jumps, and\\nthe random walk exhibits a metastable behavior: at first it collapses to a\\nlocal equilibrium, then, on a larger timescale, it can be effectively described\\nas a mean-field process on the $m$ communities, with a decay to equilibrium\\nwhich is asymptotically smooth and exponential. Finally, for the critical\\nregime, we show a sort of interpolation of the two above-mentioned behaviors.\\nAlthough the metastable behavior shown in the supercritical regime appears\\nnatural from a heuristic standpoint, a substantial part of our analysis can be\\nread as a control on the homogenization of the underlying random environment.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:05:55Z\"}"}
