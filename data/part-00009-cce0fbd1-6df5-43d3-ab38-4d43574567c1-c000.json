This\\nwork introduces a framework that combines the best of both worlds -- the strong\\nperformance of supervised approaches and the flexibility of zero-shot methods.\\nThis is achieved through a novel architectural design that seamlessly\\nintegrates the degradation operator directly into the denoiser. In each block,\\nour proposed architecture applies the degradation operator on the network\\nactivations and conditions the output using the attention mechanism, enabling\\nadaptation to diverse degradation scenarios while maintaining high performance.\\nOur work demonstrates the versatility of the proposed architecture, operating\\nas a general MMSE estimator, a posterior sampler, or a Neural Posterior\\nPrincipal Component estimator. This flexibility enables a wide range of\\ndownstream tasks, highlighting the broad applicability of our framework. The\\nproposed modification of the denoiser network offers a versatile, accurate, and\\ncomputationally efficient solution, demonstrating the advantages of dedicated\\nnetwork architectures for complex inverse problems. Experimental results on the\\nFFHQ and ImageNet datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art posterior-sampling\\nperformance, surpassing both training-based and zero-shot alternatives.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:40:57Z\"}"}
