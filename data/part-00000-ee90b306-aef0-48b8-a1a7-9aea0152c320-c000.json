Humans are usually able to ask questions that involve some general\\nlife knowledge and demonstrate higher order cognitive skills. However, the\\nquestions generated by existing methods are often limited to shallow contextual\\nquestions that are uninspiring and have a large gap to the human level. In this\\npaper, we propose a three-stage external knowledge-enhanced follow-up question\\ngeneration method, which generates questions by identifying contextual topics,\\nconstructing a knowledge graph (KG) online, and finally combining these with a\\nlarge language model to generate the final question. The model generates\\ninformation-rich and exploratory follow-up questions by introducing external\\ncommon sense knowledge and performing a knowledge fusion operation. Experiments\\nshow that compared to baseline models, our method generates questions that are\\nmore informative and closer to human questioning levels while maintaining\\ncontextual relevance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T08:31:03Z\"}"}
