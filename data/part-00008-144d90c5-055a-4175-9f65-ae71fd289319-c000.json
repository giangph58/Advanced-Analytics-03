However, ensuring the reliability and interpretability of their\\noutputs remains a significant challenge. In our framework, we conceptualize the\\ncollaboration between AI and human scientists as a dynamic interplay among\\nthree modules: the reasoning module, the interpretation module, and the\\nAI-scientist interaction module. Recognizing that effective physics reasoning\\ndemands rigorous logical consistency, quantitative precision, and deep\\nintegration with established theoretical models, we introduce the\\ninterpretation module to improve the understanding of AI-generated outputs,\\nwhich is not previously explored in the literature. This module comprises\\nmultiple specialized agents, including summarizers, model builders, UI\\nbuilders, and testers, which collaboratively structure LLM outputs within a\\nphysically grounded framework, by constructing a more interpretable science\\nmodel. A case study demonstrates that our approach enhances transparency,\\nfacilitates validation, and strengthens AI-augmented reasoning in scientific\\ndiscovery.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.CL,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T17:13:16Z\"}"}
