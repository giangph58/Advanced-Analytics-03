Traditional Linear Eddy Viscosity Models often struggle\\nwith separated flows. Our approach introduces a physics-based binary classifier\\nthat systematically identifies separated shear layers requiring correction by\\nanalyzing the relative magnitudes of terms in the turbulence kinetic energy\\nequation. Using symbolic regression, we develop compact correction terms for\\nReynolds stress anisotropy and turbulent kinetic energy production. Trained on\\ntwo-dimensional configurations, our model demonstrates significant improvements\\nin predicting separation dynamics while maintaining baseline performance and\\nfully attached flows. Generalization tests on Ahmed body and Faith Hill\\nthree-dimensional configurations confirm robust transferability, establishing\\nan effective methodology for targeted enhancement of RANS predictions in\\nseparated flows.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T10:22:36Z\"}"}
