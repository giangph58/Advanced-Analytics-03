In this study, we provide\\nexperimental evidence of semi-stable non-equilibrium phase separation in SCFs\\nthrough opacity measurements and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). By\\ninvestigating the thermophysical properties of helium, argon, and krypton\\nduring adiabatic expansion, we show that cooling dynamics vary significantly\\namong species, influencing cluster formation. Neutron scattering measurements\\nreveal distinct variations in signal intensity, supporting that the clusters\\nslowly dissolve into the background with a surprisingly long time scale of tens\\nof minutes. Given that SCFs in industrial applications frequently experience\\ndynamic, non-equilibrium conditions rather than in strict thermodynamic\\nequilibrium, our results provide crucial insights with potential implications\\nfor advanced material processing, energy systems, and chemical engineering.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T02:20:59Z\"}"}
