In this study, we address this problem using quantum\\nneural networks in combination with a problem-inspired circuit and customised\\nas well as predefined ans\\\\\\\"{a}tz. To facilitate the resource-efficient quantum\\nstate classification, we construct the dataset of quantum states using the\\nproposed problem-inspired circuit. The problem-inspired circuit incorporates\\ntwo-qubit parameterised unitary gates of varying entangling power, which is\\nfurther integrated with the ans\\\\\\\"{a}tz, developing an entire quantum neural\\nnetwork. To demonstrate the capability of the selected ans\\\\\\\"{a}tz, we visualise\\nthe mitigated barren plateaus. The designed quantum neural network demonstrates\\nthe efficiency in binary and multi-class classification tasks. This work\\nestablishes a foundation for the classification of multi-qubit quantum states\\nand offers the potential for generalisation to multi-qubit pure quantum states.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T06:42:32Z\"}"}
