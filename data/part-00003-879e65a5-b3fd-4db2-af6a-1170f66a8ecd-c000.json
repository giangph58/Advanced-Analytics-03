{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07028v1\", \"title\": \"UAV Position Estimation using a LiDAR-based 3D Object Detection Method\", \"summary\": \"This paper explores the use of applying a deep learning approach for 3D\\nobject detection to compute the relative position of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle\\n(UAV) from an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) equipped with a LiDAR sensor in a\\nGPS-denied environment. This was achieved by evaluating the LiDAR sensor's data\\nthrough a 3D detection algorithm (PointPillars). The PointPillars algorithm\\nincorporates a column voxel point-cloud representation and a 2D Convolutional\\nNeural Network (CNN) to generate distinctive point-cloud features representing\\nthe object to be identified, in this case, the UAV. The current localization\\nmethod utilizes point-cloud segmentation, Euclidean clustering, and predefined\\nheuristics to obtain the relative position of the UAV. Results from the two\\nmethods were then compared to a reference truth solution.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T16:43:59Z\"}"}
