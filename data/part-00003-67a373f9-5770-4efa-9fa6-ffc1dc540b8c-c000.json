{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06915v1\", \"title\": \"An Analysis of Temporal Dropout in Earth Observation Time Series for\\n  Regression Tasks\", \"summary\": \"Missing instances in time series data impose a significant challenge to deep\\nlearning models, particularly in regression tasks. In the Earth Observation\\nfield, satellite failure or cloud occlusion frequently results in missing\\ntime-steps, introducing uncertainties in the predicted output and causing a\\ndecline in predictive performance. While many studies address missing\\ntime-steps through data augmentation to improve model robustness, the\\nuncertainty arising at the input level is commonly overlooked. To address this\\ngap, we introduce Monte Carlo Temporal Dropout (MC-TD), a method that\\nexplicitly accounts for input-level uncertainty by randomly dropping time-steps\\nduring inference using a predefined dropout ratio, thereby simulating the\\neffect of missing data. To bypass the need for costly searches for the optimal\\ndropout ratio, we extend this approach with Monte Carlo Concrete Temporal\\nDropout (MC-ConcTD), a method that learns the optimal dropout distribution\\ndirectly. Both MC-TD and MC-ConcTD are applied during inference, leveraging\\nMonte Carlo sampling for uncertainty quantification. Experiments on three EO\\ntime-series datasets demonstrate that MC-ConcTD improves predictive performance\\nand uncertainty calibration compared to existing approaches. Additionally, we\\nhighlight the advantages of adaptive dropout tuning over manual selection,\\nmaking uncertainty quantification more robust and accessible for EO\\napplications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:23:04Z\"}"}
