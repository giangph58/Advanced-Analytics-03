{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06114v1\", \"title\": \"Computing for Community-Based Economies: A Sociotechnical Ecosystem for\\n  Democratic, Egalitarian and Sustainable Futures\", \"summary\": \"Automation and industrial mass production, particularly in sectors with low\\nwages, have harmful consequences that contribute to widening wealth\\ndisparities, excessive pollution, and worsened working conditions. Coupled with\\na mass consumption society, there is a risk of detrimental social outcomes and\\nthreats to democracy, such as misinformation and political polarization. But\\nAI, robotics and other emerging technologies could also provide a transition to\\ncommunity-based economies, in which more democratic, egalitarian, and\\nsustainable value circulations can be established. Based on both a review of\\ncase studies, and our own experiments in Detroit, we derive three core\\nprinciples for the use of computing in community-based economies. The\\nprefigurative principle requires that the development process itself\\nincorporates equity goals, rather than viewing equity as something to be\\nachieved in the future. The generative principle requires the prevention of\\nvalue extraction, and its replacement by circulations in which value is\\nreturned back to the aspects of labor, nature, and society by which it is\\ngenerated. And third, the solidarity principle requires that deployments at all\\nscales and across all domains support both individual freedoms and\\nopportunities for mutual aid. Thus we propose the use of computational\\ntechnologies to develop a specifically generative form of community-based\\neconomy: one that is egalitarian regarding race, class and gender; sustainable\\nboth environmentally and socially; and democratic in the deep sense of putting\\npeople in control of their own lives and livelihoods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T15:06:10Z\"}"}
