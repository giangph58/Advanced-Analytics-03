{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02743v1\", \"title\": \"Sequential Binary Hypothesis Testing with Competing Agents under\\n  Information Asymmetry\", \"summary\": \"This paper concerns sequential hypothesis testing in competitive multi-agent\\nsystems where agents exchange potentially manipulated information.\\nSpecifically, a two-agent scenario is studied where each agent aims to\\ncorrectly infer the true state of nature while optimizing decision speed and\\naccuracy. At each iteration, agents collect private observations, update their\\nbeliefs, and share (possibly corrupted) belief signals with their counterparts\\nbefore deciding whether to stop and declare a state, or continue gathering more\\ninformation. The analysis yields three main results: (1)~when agents share\\ninformation strategically, the optimal signaling policy involves\\nequal-probability randomization between truthful and inverted beliefs;\\n(2)~agents maximize performance by relying solely on their own observations for\\nbelief updating while using received information only to anticipate their\\ncounterpart's stopping decision; and (3)~the agent reaching their confidence\\nthreshold first cause the other agent to achieve a higher conditional\\nprobability of error. Numerical simulations further demonstrate that agents\\nwith higher KL divergence in their conditional distributions gain competitive\\nadvantage. Furthermore, our results establish that information sharing --\\ndespite strategic manipulation -- reduces overall system stopping time compared\\nto non-interactive scenarios, which highlights the inherent value of\\ncommunication even in this competitive setup.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.MA,cs.SY,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T16:30:40Z\"}"}
