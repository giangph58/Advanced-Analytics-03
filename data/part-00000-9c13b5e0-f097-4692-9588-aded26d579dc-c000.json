During LGD-estimation, realised recovery cash flows are to\\nbe discounted at an appropriate rate. Regulatory guidance mandates that this\\nrate should allow for the time value of money, as well as include a risk\\npremium that reflects the \\\"undiversifiable risk\\\" within these recoveries.\\nHaving extensively reviewed earlier methods of determining this rate, we\\npropose a new approach that is inspired by the cost of capital approach from\\nthe Solvency II regulatory regime. Our method involves estimating a\\nmarket-consistent price for a portfolio of defaulted loans, from which an\\nassociated discount rate may be inferred. We apply this method to mortgage and\\npersonal loans data from a large South African bank. The results reveal the\\nmain drivers of the discount rate to be the mean and variance of these\\nrecoveries, as well as the bank's cost of capital in excess of the risk-free\\nrate. Our method therefore produces a discount rate that reflects both the\\nundiversifiable risk of recovery recoveries and the time value of money,\\nthereby satisfying regulatory requirements. This work can subsequently enhance\\nthe LGD-component within the modelling of both regulatory and economic capital.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.RM\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.RM,q-fin.ST\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T12:09:21Z\"}"}
