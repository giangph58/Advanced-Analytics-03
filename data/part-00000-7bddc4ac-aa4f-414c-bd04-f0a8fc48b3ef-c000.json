{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23890v1\", \"title\": \"Less is More: Contextual Sampling for Nonlinear Data-Enabled Predictive\\n  Control\", \"summary\": \"Data-enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) is a powerful data-driven approach\\nfor predictive control without requiring an explicit system model. However, its\\nhigh computational cost limits its applicability to real-time robotic systems.\\nFor robotic applications such as motion planning and trajectory tracking,\\nreal-time control is crucial. Nonlinear DeePC either relies on large datasets\\nor learning the nonlinearities to ensure predictive accuracy, leading to high\\ncomputational complexity. This work introduces contextual sampling, a novel\\ndata selection strategy to handle nonlinearities for DeePC by dynamically\\nselecting the most relevant data at each time step. By reducing the dataset\\nsize while preserving prediction accuracy, our method improves computational\\nefficiency, of DeePC for real-time robotic applications. We validate our\\napproach for autonomous vehicle motion planning. For a dataset size of 100\\nsub-trajectories, Contextual sampling DeePC reduces tracking error by 53.2 %\\ncompared to Leverage Score sampling. Additionally, Contextual sampling reduces\\nmax computation time by 87.2 % compared to using the full dataset of 491\\nsub-trajectories while achieving comparable tracking performance. These results\\nhighlight the potential of Contextual sampling to enable real-time, data-driven\\ncontrol for robotic systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T09:41:44Z\"}"}
