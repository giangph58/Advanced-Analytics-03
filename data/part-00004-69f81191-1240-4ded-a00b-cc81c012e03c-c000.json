{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02243v1\", \"title\": \"The growth of transcendental entire solutions of linear difference\\n  equations with polynomial coefficients\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we study the growth of transcendental entire solutions of\\nlinear difference equations\\n  \\\\begin{equation}\\n  P_m(z)\\\\Delta^mf(z)+\\\\cdots+P_1(z)\\\\Delta f(z)+P_0(z)f(z)=0,\\\\tag{+}\\n  \\\\end{equation} where $P_j(z)$ are polynomials for $j=0,\\\\ldots,m$. At first,\\nwe reveal type of binomial series in terms of its coefficients. Second, we give\\na list of all possible orders, which are less than 1, and types of\\ntranscendental entire solutions of linear difference equations $(+)$. In\\nparticular, we give so far the best precise growth estimate of transcendental\\nentire solutions of order less than 1 of $(+)$, which improves results in [3,\\n4], [5], [7]. Third, for any given rational number $\\\\rho\\\\in(0,1)$ and real\\nnumber $\\\\sigma\\\\in(0,\\\\infty)$, we can construct a linear difference equation\\nwith polynomial coefficients which has a transcendental entire solution of\\norder $\\\\rho$ and type $\\\\sigma$. At last, some examples are illustrated for our\\nmain theorem.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CV\", \"categories\": \"math.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T03:16:01Z\"}"}
