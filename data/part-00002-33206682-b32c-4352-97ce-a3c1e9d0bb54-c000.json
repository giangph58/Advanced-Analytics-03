Using a multistage Monte Carlo\\nsimulation of in-medium jet shower evolution, we explore flavor-dependent\\nmedium effects through simulations of inclusive and $\\\\gamma$-tagged jets. The\\nresults show that quark jets undergo a non-monotonic modification compared to\\ngluon jets in observables such as the Pb-Pb to $p$-$p$ ratio of the Soft Drop\\nprong angle $r_g$, the relative prong transverse momentum $k_{T,g}$ and the\\ngroomed mass $m_g$ distributions. Due to this non-monotonic modification,\\n$\\\\gamma$-tagged jets, enriched in quark jets, provide surprisingly clear\\nsignals of medium-induced structural modifications, distinct from effects\\ndominated by selection bias. This work highlights the potential of hard\\nsubstructures in $\\\\gamma$-tagged jets as powerful tools for probing the\\njet-medium interactions in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. All simulations\\nfor $\\\\gamma$-tagged jet analyses carried out in this paper used triggered\\nevents containing at least one hard photon, which highlights the utility of\\nthese observables for future Bayesian analysis.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,nucl-ex,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T03:46:34Z\"}"}
