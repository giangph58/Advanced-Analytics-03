The formalism\\nadopted here involves calculation of the in-medium potential of the HQ in a\\nweak magnetic field, which then serves as a proxy for the resummed gluon\\npropagator in the calculation of HQ self-energy ($\\\\Sigma$). The self-energy\\ndetermines the scattering rate of HQs with light thermal partons, which is\\nsubsequently used to evaluate $\\\\kappa$ and $D_s$. It is observed that\\nnon-perturbative effects play a dominant role at low temperature. The spatial\\ndiffusion coefficient $2\\\\pi T D_s$, exhibits good agreement with recent LQCD\\nresults. These findings can be applied to calculate the heavy quark directed\\nflow at RHIC and LHC energies. An extension of this formalism to the case of\\nfinite HQ momentum has also been attempted.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T05:11:06Z\"}"}
