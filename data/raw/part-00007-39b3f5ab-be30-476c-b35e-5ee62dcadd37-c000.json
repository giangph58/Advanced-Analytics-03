We show that this renormalon,\\nfound previously in perturbation theory at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the\\n$1/N$ expansion, gives indeed the correct asymptotic expansion of the exact\\nlarge $N$ solution of the model, and we determine explicitly the complete\\ntrans-series of non-perturbative corrections to the perturbative result. We\\nalso use this framework to study the $O(N)$-invariant two-point function of the\\nscalar field. As expected, it is IR finite in perturbation theory, but it is\\nafflicted as well with an IR renormalon singularity and is not Borel summable.\\nThe pole mass is purely non-perturbative and its trans-series can be also fully\\ndetermined at NLO in $1/N$\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T13:00:45Z\"}"}
