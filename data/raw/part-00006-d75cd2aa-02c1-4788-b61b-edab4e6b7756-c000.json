Let $T_{n,m}$ be the class consisting of all\\nnonisomorphic two-terminal graphs on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. Let $G$ be any\\ntwo-terminal graph in $T_{n,m}$, and let $d$ be any positive integer. For each\\n$\\\\rho\\\\in [0,1]$, the \\\\emph{$d$-constrained two-terminal reliability of $G$ at\\n$\\\\rho$}, denoted $R_G^d(\\\\rho)$, is the probability that $G$ has some path of\\nlength at most $d$ joining its terminals after each of its edges is\\nindependently deleted with probability $\\\\rho$. We say $G$ is a\\n\\\\emph{$d$-uniformly most reliable two-terminal graph} ($d$-UMRTTG) if for each\\n$H$ in $T_{n,m}$ and every $\\\\rho \\\\in [0,1]$ it holds that $R_{G}^d(\\\\rho)\\\\geq\\nR_H^d(\\\\rho)$. Previous works studied the existence of $d$-UMRTTG in $T_{n,m}$\\nwhen $d$ is greater than or equal to $n-1$, or equivalently, when the distance\\nconstraint is dropped. In this work, a characterization of all $1$-UMRTTGs and\\n$2$-UMRTTGs is given. Then, it is proved that there exists a unique $3$-UMRTTG\\nin $T_{n,m}$ when $n\\\\geq 6$ and $5 \\\\leq m \\\\leq 2n-3$. Finally, for each $d\\\\geq\\n4$ and each $n\\\\geq 11$ it is proved that there is no $d$-UMRTTG in $T_{n,m}$\\nwhen $20 \\\\leq m \\\\leq 3n-9$ or when $3n-5 \\\\leq m \\\\leq \\\\binom{n}{2}-2$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:49:34Z\"}"}
