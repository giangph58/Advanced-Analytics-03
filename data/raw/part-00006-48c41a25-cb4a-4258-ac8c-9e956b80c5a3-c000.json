Our main purpose is to describe an efficient algorithm for\\ncalculating generators of power integral bases. We show that appropriately\\nusing integer arithmetics speeds up the calculations considerably. Our\\nexperiences lead to some interesting general statements on generators of power\\nintegral bases in number fields generated by a unit.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T10:03:47Z\"}"}
