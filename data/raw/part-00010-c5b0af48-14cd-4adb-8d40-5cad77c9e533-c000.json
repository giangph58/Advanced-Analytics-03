{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21694v1\", \"title\": \"Automatic Mapping of AutomationML Files to Ontologies for Graph Queries\\n  and Validation\", \"summary\": \"AutomationML has seen widespread adoption as an open data exchange format in\\nthe automation domain. It is an open and vendor neutral standard based on the\\nextensible markup language XML. However, AutomationML extends XML with\\nadditional semantics, that limit the applicability of common XML-tools for\\napplications like querying or data validation. This article provides\\npractitioners with 1) an up-to-date ontology of the concepts in the\\nAutomationML-standard, as well as 2) a declarative mapping to automatically\\ntransform any AutomationML model into RDF triples. Together, these artifacts\\nallow practitioners an easy integration of AutomationML information into\\nindustrial knowledge graphs. A study on examples from the automation domain\\nconcludes that transforming AutomationML to OWL opens up new powerful ways for\\nquerying and validation that are impossible without transformation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:34:56Z\"}"}
