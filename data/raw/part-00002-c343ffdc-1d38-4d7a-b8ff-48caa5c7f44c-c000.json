The\\ncreation of magnetized high-energy-density plasma through such experiments\\npresents significant opportunities for exploring several terrestrial as well as\\nastrophysical phenomena, apart from controlling relativistic electron\\ntransport, directly relevant for fusion schemes. Here we demonstrate that the\\nmodest magnetic field (10$^{-3}$ megagauss ) in a common, readily available\\nNeodymium magnet is amplified to 10's of megagauss levels lasting a few\\npicoseconds, when excited by an ultraintense, femtosecond laser pulse. The\\nexperimental findings are strongly supported by particle-in-cell simulations,\\nwhich not only validate the observations but also unveil a potential dynamo\\nmechanism responsible for the enhancement and amplification of the axial\\nmagnetic field. These outcomes are of utmost importance in comprehending the\\nintricacies of relativistic electron transport and the realm of magnetized\\nlaboratory astrophysics.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T13:28:45Z\"}"}
