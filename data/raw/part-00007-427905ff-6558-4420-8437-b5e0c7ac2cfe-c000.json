{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04540v1\", \"title\": \"Registration of 3D Point Sets Using Exponential-based Similarity Matrix\", \"summary\": \"Point cloud registration is a fundamental problem in computer vision and\\nrobotics, involving the alignment of 3D point sets captured from varying\\nviewpoints using depth sensors such as LiDAR or structured light. In modern\\nrobotic systems, especially those focused on mapping, it is essential to merge\\nmultiple views of the same environment accurately. However, state-of-the-art\\nregistration techniques often struggle when large rotational differences exist\\nbetween point sets or when the data is significantly corrupted by sensor noise.\\nThese challenges can lead to misalignments and, consequently, to inaccurate or\\ndistorted 3D reconstructions. In this work, we address both these limitations\\nby proposing a robust modification to the classic Iterative Closest Point (ICP)\\nalgorithm. Our method, termed Exponential Similarity Matrix ICP (ESM-ICP),\\nintegrates a Gaussian-inspired exponential weighting scheme to construct a\\nsimilarity matrix that dynamically adapts across iterations. This matrix\\nfacilitates improved estimation of both rotational and translational components\\nduring alignment. We demonstrate the robustness of ESM-ICP in two challenging\\nscenarios: (i) large rotational discrepancies between the source and target\\npoint clouds, and (ii) data corrupted by non-Gaussian noise. Our results show\\nthat ESM-ICP outperforms traditional geometric registration techniques as well\\nas several recent learning-based methods. To encourage reproducibility and\\ncommunity engagement, our full implementation is made publicly available on\\nGitHub. https://github.com/aralab-unr/ESM_ICP\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T16:17:54Z\"}"}
