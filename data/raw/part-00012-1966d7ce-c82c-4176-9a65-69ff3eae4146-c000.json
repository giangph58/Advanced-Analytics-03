For several tasks, quantifying the\\nuncertainty of SAM is of particular interest. However, the ambiguous nature of\\nthe class-agnostic foundation model SAM challenges current uncertainty\\nquantification (UQ) approaches. This paper presents a theoretically motivated\\nuncertainty quantification model based on a Bayesian entropy formulation\\njointly respecting aleatoric, epistemic, and the newly introduced task\\nuncertainty. We use this formulation to train USAM, a lightweight post-hoc UQ\\nmethod. Our model traces the root of uncertainty back to under-parameterised\\nmodels, insufficient prompts or image ambiguities. Our proposed deterministic\\nUSAM demonstrates superior predictive capabilities on the SA-V, MOSE, ADE20k,\\nDAVIS, and COCO datasets, offering a computationally cheap and easy-to-use UQ\\nalternative that can support user-prompting, enhance semi-supervised pipelines,\\nor balance the tradeoff between accuracy and cost efficiency.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T08:36:23Z\"}"}
