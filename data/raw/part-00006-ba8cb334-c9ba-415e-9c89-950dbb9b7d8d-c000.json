We prove that its commutator\\nsubalgebra is a quotient of the polynomial ring over an auxiliary Lie\\nsubalgebra $N_K$ of the graph Lie algebra $L_K$, and conjecture that the\\nquotient map is an isomorphism. The epimorphism is defined in terms of a new\\noperation in the associated Lie algebra, which corresponds to the squaring and\\nhas an analogue in homotopy theory.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GR\", \"categories\": \"math.GR,math.AT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T15:13:49Z\"}"}
