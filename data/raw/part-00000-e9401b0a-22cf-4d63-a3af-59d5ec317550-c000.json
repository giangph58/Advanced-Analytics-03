{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06042v1\", \"title\": \"An Adaptive Algorithm for Bilevel Optimization on Riemannian Manifolds\", \"summary\": \"Existing methods for solving Riemannian bilevel optimization (RBO) problems\\nrequire prior knowledge of the problem's first- and second-order information\\nand curvature parameter of the Riemannian manifold to determine step sizes,\\nwhich poses practical limitations when these parameters are unknown or\\ncomputationally infeasible to obtain. In this paper, we introduce the Adaptive\\nRiemannian Hypergradient Descent (AdaRHD) algorithm for solving RBO problems.\\nTo the best of our knowledge, AdaRHD is the first method to incorporate a fully\\nadaptive step size strategy that eliminates the need for problem-specific\\nparameters. We prove that AdaRHD achieves an $\\\\mathcal{O}(1/\\\\epsilon)$\\niteration complexity for finding an $\\\\epsilon$-stationary point, thus matching\\nthe complexity of existing non-adaptive methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate\\nthat substituting exponential mappings with retraction mappings maintains the\\nsame complexity bound. Experiments demonstrate that AdaRHD achieves comparable\\nperformance to existing non-adaptive approaches while exhibiting greater\\nrobustness.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:42:18Z\"}"}
