In this study, we experimentally investigate\\nthe droplet coalescence during the impact of hot droplets on a liquid film by\\nusing color interferometry, high-speed imaging, and infrared imaging. We find\\nthat the coalescence of the hot droplet with the liquid film can be delayed\\nwhich is mediated by the intervening gas layer between the droplet and the\\nfilm. Compared with droplets at room temperature, the residence time of hot\\ndroplets can increase by more than two orders of magnitude. We find that the\\nthickness of the gas layer increases with the droplet temperature, explaining\\nthat the thermal delay of coalescence is due to the thicker gas layer. During\\nthe hot droplet impact, the temperature gradient at the bottom of the droplet\\ninduces Maranogni flow, which can delay the drainage of the intervening gas\\nlayer. The results also show that as the Weber number increases, the residence\\ntime of the droplet decreases because of the thinner thickness of the gas\\nlayer.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:20:19Z\"}"}
