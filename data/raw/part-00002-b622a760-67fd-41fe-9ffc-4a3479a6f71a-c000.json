{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05795v1\", \"title\": \"Robust Fusion Controller: Degradation-aware Image Fusion with\\n  Fine-grained Language Instructions\", \"summary\": \"Current image fusion methods struggle to adapt to real-world environments\\nencompassing diverse degradations with spatially varying characteristics. To\\naddress this challenge, we propose a robust fusion controller (RFC) capable of\\nachieving degradation-aware image fusion through fine-grained language\\ninstructions, ensuring its reliable application in adverse environments.\\nSpecifically, RFC first parses language instructions to innovatively derive the\\nfunctional condition and the spatial condition, where the former specifies the\\ndegradation type to remove, while the latter defines its spatial coverage.\\nThen, a composite control priori is generated through a multi-condition\\ncoupling network, achieving a seamless transition from abstract language\\ninstructions to latent control variables. Subsequently, we design a hybrid\\nattention-based fusion network to aggregate multi-modal information, in which\\nthe obtained composite control priori is deeply embedded to linearly modulate\\nthe intermediate fused features. To ensure the alignment between language\\ninstructions and control outcomes, we introduce a novel language-feature\\nalignment loss, which constrains the consistency between feature-level gains\\nand the composite control priori. Extensive experiments on publicly available\\ndatasets demonstrate that our RFC is robust against various composite\\ndegradations, particularly in highly challenging flare scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T08:22:55Z\"}"}
