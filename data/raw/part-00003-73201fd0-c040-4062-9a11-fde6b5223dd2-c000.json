Cellular-Potts models (CPMs) are often computationally expensive due\\nto the explicit modeling of interactions among large numbers of individual\\nmodel agents and diffusive fields described by partial differential equations\\n(PDEs). In this work, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) surrogate\\nmodel using a U-Net architecture that accounts for periodic boundary\\nconditions. We use this model to accelerate the evaluation of a mechanistic CPM\\npreviously used to investigate \\\\textit{in vitro} vasculogenesis. The surrogate\\nmodel was trained to predict 100 computational steps ahead (Monte-Carlo steps,\\nMCS), accelerating simulation evaluations by a factor of 590 times compared to\\nCPM code execution. Over multiple recursive evaluations, our model effectively\\ncaptures the emergent behaviors demonstrated by the original Cellular-Potts\\nmodel of such as vessel sprouting, extension and anastomosis, and contraction\\nof vascular lacunae. This approach demonstrates the potential for deep learning\\nto serve as efficient surrogate models for CPM simulations, enabling faster\\nevaluation of computationally expensive CPM of biological processes at greater\\nspatial and temporal scales.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,q-bio.QM\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T05:30:38Z\"}"}
