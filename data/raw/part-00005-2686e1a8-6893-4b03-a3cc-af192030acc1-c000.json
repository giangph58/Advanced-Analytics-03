The method\\nis based on the construction of an uncertainty-aware functional distribution\\n(UAFD) in a space spanned by a few different exchange-correlation functionals\\nand is illustrated at the level of generalized-gradient-approximation\\nfunctionals. The UAFD provides reliable estimates of errors -- compared to\\nexperiments or higher-quality calculations -- in calculations performed\\nself-consistently with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional. The scheme\\nfurthermore allows for a decomposition of the error into a systematic bias and\\na reduced error. The approach is applied to four different properties:\\nmolecular atomization energies, cohesive energies, lattice constants, and bulk\\nmoduli of solids. The probability distribution can be tailored to optimize the\\nprediction of a single property or for several properties simultaneously.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.data-an\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T11:07:13Z\"}"}
