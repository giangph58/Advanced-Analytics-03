Using AI systems, some tasks within these domains can be\\nefficiently handled. Explainable AI (XAI) aims to increase the reliability of\\nAI solutions by explaining model reasoning. For time series, many XAI methods\\nprovide point- or sequence-based attribution maps. These methods explain model\\nreasoning in terms of low-level patterns. However, they do not capture\\nhigh-level patterns that may also influence model reasoning. We propose a\\nconcept-based method to provide explanations in terms of these high-level\\npatterns. In this paper, we present C-SHAP for time series, an approach which\\ndetermines the contribution of concepts to a model outcome. We provide a\\ngeneral definition of C-SHAP and present an example implementation using time\\nseries decomposition. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the\\nmethodology through a use case from the energy domain.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T13:06:32Z\"}"}
