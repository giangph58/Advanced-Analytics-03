In the non-asymptotic setting, for the proposed\\ntruncated estimators, the properties of guaranteed mean-square estimation\\naccuracy are established. In the asymptotic formulation, when the observation\\ntime tends to infinity, it is shown that the proposed sequential procedures are\\nasymptotically optimal among all possible sequential and non-sequential\\nestimates with an average estimation time less than the fixed observation\\nduration. It also turned out that asymptotically, without degrading the\\nestimation quality, they significantly reduce the observation duration compared\\nto classical non-sequential maximum likelihood estimations based on a fixed\\nobservation duration.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:04:47Z\"}"}
