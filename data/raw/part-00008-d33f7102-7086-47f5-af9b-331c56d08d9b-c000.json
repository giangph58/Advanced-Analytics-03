Rev. A 111, 022204 (2025)], Genovese and\\nPiacentini analyzed recent experiments measuring what they call \\\"the entire\\nBell-CHSH parameter\\\". They claimed those experiments may have implications for\\ninterpreting loophole-fee tests of the Bell-CHSH inequality. We explain that\\nthe Bell-CHSH inequality is not based on the entire Bell parameter, so these\\nexperiments are unrelated to their empirical tests and cannot close eventual\\nloopholes that still might persist. We point out that the physical meaning of\\nthese new experiments measuring the entire Bell parameter could be interpreted\\ndifferently.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T15:50:30Z\"}"}
