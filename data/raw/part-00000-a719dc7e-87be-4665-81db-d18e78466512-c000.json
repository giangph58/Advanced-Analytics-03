This study presents a\\ndataset of 1654 labeled RGB images (512x512) of steel surfaces, classified as\\neither \\\"ready for paint\\\" or \\\"needs shot-blasting.\\\" The dataset captures\\nreal-world surface defects, including discoloration, welding lines, scratches\\nand corrosion, making it well-suited for training computer vision models.\\nAdditionally, three classification approaches were evaluated: Compact\\nConvolutional Transformers (CCT), Support Vector Machines (SVM) with ResNet-50\\nfeature extraction, and a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE). The supervised\\nmethods (CCT and SVM) achieve 95% classification accuracy on the test set, with\\nCCT leveraging transformer-based attention mechanisms and SVM offering a\\ncomputationally efficient alternative. The CAE approach, while less effective,\\nestablishes a baseline for unsupervised quality control. We present\\ninterpretable decision-making by all three neural networks, allowing industry\\nusers to visually pinpoint problematic regions and understand the model's\\nrationale. By releasing the dataset and baseline codes, this work aims to\\nsupport further research in defect detection, advance the development of\\ninterpretable computer vision models for quality control, and encourage the\\nadoption of automated inspection systems in industrial applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.NE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T07:51:58Z\"}"}
