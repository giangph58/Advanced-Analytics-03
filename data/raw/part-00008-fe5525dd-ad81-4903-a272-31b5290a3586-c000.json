The majority\\nof measurements assessing the source properties are based on identical particle\\npairs, providing direct access to the characteristics of the single-particle\\nsource. The work in this paper demonstrates, via femtoscopy measurements of\\ncharged pion-deuteron pairs in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\\\sqrt{s_{\\\\rm NN}} = 5.02$\\nTeV, the feasibility of accessing the characteristics of the single-particle\\nfemtoscopic source by using particle pairs with large mass differences such as\\npions and deuterons. The first experimental results of the measurement of\\ndeuteron source sizes in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions are presented.\\nThe results show good agreement with the trend derived from other charged\\nhadrons such as pions, kaons, and protons as a function of transverse mass,\\nindicating similar source properties\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-ex\", \"categories\": \"nucl-ex,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T07:11:18Z\"}"}
