{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03272v1\", \"title\": \"Tailoring ultra-high-order optical skyrmions\", \"summary\": \"Skyrmions, as quasiparticles with topological spin textures, has recently\\ngarnered great attention for both condensed matter and structured wave\\ncommunities, promising next-generation large-density robust information\\ntechnologies. However, a big challenge to this end is that the generation of\\nhigh-order skyrmions is elusive in any physical systems. Here, we propose the\\nmethod to create and control ultra-high-order skyrmions (skyrmion number up to\\n$400^{th}$) in a structured light system. We also experimentally control the\\ntopological state transition between bimeron and skyrmion, arbitrarily tailor\\nthe transverse size of an arbitrary-order skyrmionic beam independent of\\ntopological number, and ensure the topological stability upon propagation. Our\\nwork offers solutions for topologically resilient communication and memory with\\nmuch enhanced information capacity.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:03:29Z\"}"}
