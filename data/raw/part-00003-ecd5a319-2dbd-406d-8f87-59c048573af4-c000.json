{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16610v1\", \"title\": \"A model of the heliocentric dust ring on Venus orbit\", \"summary\": \"A heliocentric dust ring on Venus orbit was discovered following observations\\nby the Helios spacecraft, and then confirmed thanks to observations by STEREO\\nand the Parker Solar Probe. The impact risk it poses needs to be evaluated for\\nany spacecraft crossing the ring. This study aims to provide a first model of\\nthe dust ring, in terms of distribution of particles (including size\\ndistribution), velocity, density of the ring, and deduce a first estimation of\\nthe impact risk to spacecrafts crossing the ring. We seek to describe the\\norbits of dust particles in the ring. We explore a first simple model, that\\nleads us to propose a second, more elaborate, model. This model is then\\npopulated by particles that we integrate for 2000 years. We demonstrate that\\nthe dust ring will persist over the next 2000 years, only slightly extending\\nradially and perpendicularly to the Venus orbital plane. We show that particles\\ntend to accumulate at Venus orbit, but that along it the differences in density\\nis negligible. We compute the number of particles we can expect to find in the\\nring. Finally, as an example, we apply this model to Bepi-Colombo to obtain a\\nfirst estimate of the impact flux in function of radius and mass, for radii\\nbetween 2 $\\\\mu$m and 2 cm (i.e. for masses between 10^-2 kg and 10^-14 kg). We\\nalso present the impact velocity and direction of impacts with respect to\\nBepi-Colombo. We are able to conclude that the ring seems to present a low risk\\nfor spacecrafts using Venus as a gravity assist.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T10:52:33Z\"}"}
