{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19677v1\", \"title\": \"A Polynomial-Time Inner Approximation Algorithm for Multi-Objective\\n  Optimization\", \"summary\": \"In multi-objective optimization, the problem of finding all non-dominated\\nimages is often intractable. However, for any multiplicative factor greater\\nthan one, an approximation set can be constructed in polynomial time for many\\nproblems. In this paper, we use the concept of convex approximation sets: Each\\nnon-dominated image is approximated by a convex combination of images of\\nsolutions in such a set. Recently, Helfrich et al. (2024) presented a convex\\napproximation algorithm that works in an adaptive fashion and outperforms all\\npreviously existing algorithms. We use a different approach for constructing an\\neven more efficient adaptive algorithm for computing convex approximation sets.\\nOur algorithm is based on the skeleton algorithm for polyhedral inner\\napproximation by Csirmaz (2021). If the weighted sum scalarization can be\\nsolved exactly or approximately in polynomial time, our algorithm can find a\\nconvex approximation set for an approximation factor arbitrarily close to this\\nsolution quality. We demonstrate that our new algorithm significantly\\noutperforms the current state-of-the-art algorithm from Helfrich et al. (2024)\\non instances of the multi-objective variants of the assignment problem, the\\nknapsack problem, and the symmetric metric travelling salesman problem.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T11:08:21Z\"}"}
