{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04544v1\", \"title\": \"Attracting without being attracted: Dark Matter as an aether wind\", \"summary\": \"We explore the possibility that part of what we call dark matter may be the\\nmark of a preferred frame, revealing a breakdown of diffeomorphism invariance.\\nIn the non-relativistic limit this appears as a deviant matter source capable\\nof attracting normal matter, but not feeling the attraction from other forms of\\nmatter or from itself. While this implies a violation of momentum conservation,\\nno logical inconsistencies arise in this deviant ``Newtonian'' limit. In\\ncontrast, due to Bianchi identities, the relativistic theory must undergo core\\nchange, and we discuss a modification of Einstein's gravity capable of coupling\\na non-conserved source to gravity. It results from fixing some of the spatial\\ncomponents of the metric, thereby constraining the possible diffeomorphisms and\\nclipping some of the equations. Bianchi identities can always be used to refill\\nthe equations, but the effective Stueckelberg stresses are so outlandish that\\nthis defines symmetry breakdown and violations of local energy-momentum\\nconservation. We work out spherically symmetric solutions with static halos and\\nflat rotation curves, with and without a central black hole. The model has the\\ndrawback that it can evade experimental constraints simply by setting to zero\\nthe local density of deviant matter (which is a non-dynamic input). Its\\npresence, in contrast, would leave inimitable signatures. We briefly discuss\\nthe Hamiltonian formulation of these models, where such dark matter appears as\\na central charge in the Poisson bracket of the Hamiltonian and the momentum.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.CO,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T16:25:53Z\"}"}
