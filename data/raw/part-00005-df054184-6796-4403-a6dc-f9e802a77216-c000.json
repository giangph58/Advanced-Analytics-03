However,\\noff-the-shelf RGB-D segmentation methods fail to fully explore cross-modal\\ninformation and suffer from object drift during long-term prediction. In this\\npaper, we propose a novel RGB-D VOS method via multi-store feature memory for\\nrobust segmentation. Specifically, we design the hierarchical modality\\nselection and fusion, which adaptively combines features from both modalities.\\nAdditionally, we develop a segmentation refinement module that effectively\\nutilizes the Segmentation Anything Model (SAM) to refine the segmentation mask,\\nensuring more reliable results as memory to guide subsequent segmentation\\ntasks. By leveraging spatio-temporal embedding and modality embedding, mixed\\nprompts and fused images are fed into SAM to unleash its potential in RGB-D\\nVOS. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves\\nstate-of-the-art performance on the latest RGB-D VOS benchmark.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T07:31:37Z\"}"}
