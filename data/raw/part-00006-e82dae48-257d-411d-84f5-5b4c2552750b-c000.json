All of the\\nevidence collected so far has been based on the changes of the THz frequency\\n$c$-axis response. In these measurements, the capacitive interlayer coupling\\nwas seen to transform into an inductive response, reminiscent of a\\nsuperconducting state, an assignement that was strengthened by recent\\nmeasurements of ultrafast magnetic field expulsion. Here, we report the first\\nexperimental determination of the transient in-plane optical properties. These\\nexperiements have so far been challenging because of the high in-plane\\nequilibrium reflectivity, from which small changes in the optical response\\ndetermine the transient conductivity. We observe a photo-induced in-plane\\noptical gap $2\\\\Delta\\\\simeq30$ cm$^{-1}$ and a divergent imaginary conductivity,\\nalso consistent with photo-induced superconductivity. A global fit to these\\ndata suggests that in- and out-of-plane electronic properties never completely\\nequilibrate during the dynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T13:32:35Z\"}"}
