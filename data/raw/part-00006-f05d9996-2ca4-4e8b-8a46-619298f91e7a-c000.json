One of the primary\\nobjectives of causal mediation analysis is to decompose the total effect into\\npath-specific components. In this study, we investigate the path-specific\\nprobability of necessity and sufficiency (PNS) to decompose the total PNS into\\npath-specific components along distinct causal pathways between treatment and\\noutcome, incorporating two mediators. We define the path-specific PNS for\\ndecomposition and provide an identification theorem. Furthermore, we conduct\\nnumerical experiments to assess the properties of the proposed estimators from\\nfinite samples and demonstrate their practical application using a real-world\\neducational dataset.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T06:40:17Z\"}"}
