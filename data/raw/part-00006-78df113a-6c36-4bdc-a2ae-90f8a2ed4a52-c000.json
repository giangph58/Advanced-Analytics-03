Recently, the first\\ninfinite family of Euclidean self-dual binary and nonbinary cyclic codes, whose\\nminimum distances have a square-root lower bound and have a lower bound better\\nthan square-root lower bounds are constructed in \\\\cite{Chen23} for the lengths\\nof these codes being unbounded. Let $q$ be a power of a prime number and\\n$Q=q^2$. In this paper, we first improve the lower bounds on the minimum\\ndistances of Euclidean and Hermitian duals of BCH codes with length\\n$\\\\frac{q^m-1}{q^s-1}$ over $\\\\mathbb{F}_q$ and $\\\\frac{Q^m-1}{Q-1}$ over\\n$\\\\mathbb{F}_Q$ in \\\\cite{Fan23,GDL21,Wang24} for the designed distances in some\\nranges, respectively, where $\\\\frac{m}{s}\\\\geq 3$. Then based on matrix-product\\nconstruction and some lower bounds on the minimum distances of BCH codes and\\ntheir duals, we obtain several classes of Euclidean and Hermitian self-dual\\ncodes, whose minimum distances have square-root lower bounds or a\\nsquare-root-like lower bounds. Our lower bounds on the minimum distances of\\nEuclidean and Hermitian self-dual cyclic codes improved many results in\\n\\\\cite{Chen23}. In addition, our lower bounds on the minimum distances of the\\nduals of BCH codes are almost $q^s-1$ or $q$ times that of the existing lower\\nbounds.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T14:26:51Z\"}"}
