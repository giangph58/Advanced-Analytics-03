It is shown that for any non disjoint-type\\nbounded hyperbolic component $\\\\mathcal H\\\\subset \\\\mathcal P_d$, the locally\\nconnected part of $\\\\partial\\\\mathcal H$, along each regular boundary strata, has\\nfull Hausdorff dimension $2d-2$.\\n  An essential innovation in our argument involves analyzing how the canonical\\nparameterization of the hyperbolic component--realized via Blaschke products\\nover a mapping scheme--extends to the boundary. This framework allows us to\\nstudy three key aspects of $\\\\partial \\\\mathcal H$: the local connectivity\\nstructure, the perturbation behavior, and the local Hausdorff dimensions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS,math.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T08:19:52Z\"}"}
