We\\nreconsider quintessence models in this work in the context of three driving\\npotentials. We center the action of these models in the late Universe which\\nleaves early $\\\\Lambda$CDM cosmology unchanged. The effects show the potential\\nof producing a faster expanding cosmology with a high Hubble constant. The\\nmodels are constrained using the cosmic chronometer data, Pantheon plus, and\\ntransversal baryonic acoustic oscillation data.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:51:18Z\"}"}
