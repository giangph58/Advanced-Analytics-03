{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02590v1\", \"title\": \"LexPam: Legal Procedure Awareness-Guided Mathematical Reasoning\", \"summary\": \"The legal mathematical reasoning ability of LLMs is crucial when applying\\nthem to real-world scenarios, as it directly affects the credibility of the\\nLLM. While existing legal LLMs can perform general judicial question answering,\\ntheir legal mathematical reasoning capabilities have not been trained.\\nOpen-domain reasoning models, though able to generate detailed calculation\\nsteps, do not follow the reasoning logic required for legal scenarios.\\nAdditionally, there is currently a lack of legal mathematical reasoning\\ndatasets to help validate and enhance LLMs' reasoning abilities in legal\\ncontexts. To address these issues, we propose the first Chinese legal\\nMathematical Reasoning Dataset, LexNum, which includes three common legal\\nmathematical reasoning scenarios: economic compensation, work injury\\ncompensation, and traffic accident compensation. Based on LexNum, we tested the\\nperformance of existing legal LLMs and reasoning LLMs, and introduced LexPam, a\\nreinforcement learning algorithm guided by legal procedural awareness to train\\nLLMs, enhancing their mathematical reasoning abilities in legal scenarios.\\nExperiments on tasks in the three legal scenarios show that the performance of\\nexisting legal LLMs and reasoning models in legal mathematical reasoning tasks\\nis unsatisfactory. LexPam can enhance the LLM's ability in these tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T13:54:53Z\"}"}
