We perform a wide and deep exploration of the\\nenvironment of quasars at $0.4 < z < 1.0$ using the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru\\nStrategic Program (HSC-SSP) survey. We investigate the environment of the 1,912\\nspectroscopically selected quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS),\\nusing photometrically selected galaxies from the HSC-SSP data, over an area of\\n505 deg${^{2}}$. The quasar environment is compared to the environment of\\nmatched galaxies with similar stellar mass and redshift. We employ the\\n$k$-nearest neighbor method to define the local galaxy number density for both\\nthe quasars and the matched galaxies at a scale of a few hundred kpc. As a\\nresult, we find that the number density of galaxies around SDSS quasars is\\nlower than that of the matched galaxies by $\\\\sim$11--$20\\\\%$. We also\\ninvestigate possible correlations between the local galaxy number densities and\\nthe quasar properties such as black hole mass and Eddington ratio. As a result,\\nno correlation is found between the local galaxy number densities and these\\nproperties of quasars. These results suggest that the quasar activity is not\\ntriggered by the high number density of surrounding galaxies at the scale of a\\nfew hundred kpc.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T09:03:46Z\"}"}
