{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17610v1\", \"title\": \"Modeling Communication Perception in Development Teams Using Monte Carlo\\n  Methods\", \"summary\": \"Software development is a collaborative task involving diverse development\\nteams, where toxic communication can negatively impact team mood and project\\nsuccess. Mood surveys enable the early detection of underlying tensions or\\ndissatisfaction within development teams, allowing communication issues to be\\naddressed before they escalate, fostering a positive and productive work\\nenvironment. The mood can be surveyed indirectly by analyzing the text-based\\ncommunication of the team. However, emotional subjectivity leads to varying\\nsentiment interpretations across team members; a statement perceived neutrally\\nby one developer might be seen as problematic by another developer with a\\ndifferent conversational culture. Early identification of perception volatility\\ncan help prevent misunderstandings and enhance team morale while safeguarding\\nthe project. This paper analyzes the diversity of perceptions within arbitrary\\ndevelopment teams and determines how many team members should report their\\nsentiment to accurately reflect the team's mood. Through a Monte Carlo\\nexperiment involving 45 developers, we present a preliminary mathematical model\\nto calculate the minimum agreement among a subset of developers based on the\\nwhole team's agreement. This model can guide leadership in mood assessment,\\ndemonstrating that omitting even a single member in an average-sized 7-member\\nteam can misrepresent the overall mood. Therefore, including all developers in\\nmood surveying is recommended to ensure a reliable evaluation of the team's\\nmood.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:35:18Z\"}"}
