Under extra $U(1)_{L_{\\\\mu}-L_{\\\\tau}}$\\nsymmetry, the triplets are charged. We examine the stability of the electroweak\\nvacuum at the two-loop and tree-levels. The two-loop $\\\\beta$-functions are\\nfound to be capable of satisfying the vacuum stability up to the Planck scale.\\nOn the other hand, only up to $10^{12}$ GeV can the perturbative unitarity be\\nsatisfied because of the increase in the positive influence from triplet\\ndegrees of freedom. For the strongly electroweak first-order phase transition,\\nthe parameter space permitted by the Planck scale stability is examined.\\nBecause the triplet degrees of freedom contribute sufficiently to the cubic\\nterm, the model satisfies the strongly first order phase transition for the\\ntriplet bare mass parameters up to the TeV scale. For all mass ranges, it is\\nfound that this model predicts a strongly first-order phase transition until\\nthe degrees of freedom are heavy enough to separate from the thermal bath. The\\ngravitational wave signatures are tested at the benchmark places that fulfill\\nthe strongly first-order phase transition. The measurable frequency range of\\nthe LISA and BBO experiments also turns out to contain the benchmark points\\npermitted by Planck scale stability, strongly first-order phase transition.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T05:07:15Z\"}"}
