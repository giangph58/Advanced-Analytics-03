{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17521v1\", \"title\": \"Comparative Analysis of Hybrid Precoding Optimization Approaches for\\n  Millimeter Wave Massive MIMO System\", \"summary\": \"The conventional digital beamforming technique needs one radio frequency (RF)\\nchain per antenna element. High power consumption, significantly high cost of\\nRF chain components per antenna and complex signal processing task at base band\\nmakes digital beamforming unsuitable for implementation in massive MIMO system.\\nHybrid beamforming takes the benefits of both analog and digital beamforming\\nschemes. Near optimal performance can be achieved using very few RF chains in\\nhybrid beamforming method. By optimizing the hybrid transmit and receive\\nbeamformers, the spectral efficiency of a system can be maximized. The hybrid\\nbeamforming optimization problem is non-convex optimization problem due to the\\nnon-convexity of the constraints. In this research work, the millimeter wave\\nmassive MIMO system performance implementing the hybrid precoding based on the\\nconventional methods and deep neural network is studied considering the\\nspectral efficiency, bit error rate and complexity. It is shown that the deep\\nneural network based approach for hybrid precoding optimization outperforms\\nconventional techniques by solving the non-convex optimization problem.\\nMoreover, the DNN model accuracy is also analyzed by observing the training\\naccuracy and test accuracy.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T13:03:01Z\"}"}
