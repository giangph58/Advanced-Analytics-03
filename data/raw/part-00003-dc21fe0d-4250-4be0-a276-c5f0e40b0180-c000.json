The phases of\\noutburst peaks are generally stable and occur near the orbital\\nperiastron.However, significant orbital phase shifts have occasionally been\\nobserved in 1995, 2006, and 2016. In this paper, we report another orbital\\nphase shift triggered by a giant outburst in 2021. During this event, the\\norbital phase of Type-I outburst peaks changed dramatically, moving from near\\nperiastron to 20 days after periastron, followed by a gradual recovery.\\nAdditionally, for several cycles after the 2021 giant outburst, some Type-I\\noutbursts were missing, with subsequent outbursts occurring every two orbits.\\nWe discuss our observations in the frame of the precession of an eccentric Be\\ndisk.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T10:01:54Z\"}"}
