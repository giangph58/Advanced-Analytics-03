Starting with a linearized model, the impact\\nof the most important parameters is studied taking in account the\\nelectrodes-solution electrochemical interface. A detailed model is obtained and\\nthoroughly verified, and recommended operating conditions are given for certain\\nlimit load conditions. Then, a more complete non-linear model is developed to\\ntake in account the measurement uncertainty introduced by the circuit\\nnon-linear components. This non-linear model is compared to a time domain\\ndescription of the circuit and it is verified that it can predict the\\nnon-linear behavior with a precision better than 20%. This result enables the\\ncircuit designers to compensate for these effects and ultimately reduce the\\noverall measurement uncertainty.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY,94-06\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:59:50Z\"}"}
