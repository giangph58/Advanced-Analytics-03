{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03468v1\", \"title\": \"Multi-Class Stackelberg Games for the Co-Design of Networked Systems\", \"summary\": \"We investigate a co-design problem, encompassing simultaneous design of\\nsystem infrastructure and control, through a game-theoretical framework. To\\nthis end, we propose the co-design problem as a two-layer hierarchical\\nstrategic interaction. At the upper layer, a leader (or multiple leaders)\\ndetermines system design parameters, while at the lower layer, a follower (or\\nmultiple followers) optimizes the control strategy. To capture this hierarchy,\\nwe propose four novel classes of Stackelberg games that integrate diverse\\nstrategic behaviors, including combinations of cooperative and non-cooperative\\ninteractions across two different layers. Notably, the leaders' interactions\\nare represented using a normal-form game, whereas the followers' interactions\\nare modeled by different games (dynamic games in discrete time). These distinct\\ngame structures result in a Stackelberg game that accommodates different game\\ntypes per layer, and/or supports heterogeneous strategic behaviors involving\\ncooperation and non-cooperation simultaneously. Learning algorithms using the\\nbest-response dynamics are used to solve the game problems when considering a\\ndiscrete strategic space for the leaders. The efficacy of the proposed approach\\nis demonstrated through an application to the co-design of the Barcelona\\ndrinking water network.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T12:17:07Z\"}"}
