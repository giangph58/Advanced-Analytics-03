First, we extend the parametric estimates of bottom-up\\nthermalization in pure gluon systems by incorporating quark production in the\\nweak-coupling (high-energy) limit. Our analysis reveals that quark production\\ndoes not alter the qualitative features of the three-stage thermalization\\nprocess in this limit. Furthermore, we obtain the scaling behavior of the quark\\nnumber density over time at each stage. Then, by solving the Boltzmann equation\\nin diffusion approximation (BEDA) for longitudinally boost-invariant systems,\\nwe demonstrate how our detailed numerical simulations approach the predicted\\nthree-stage thermalization picture as the strong coupling $\\\\alpha_s$ decreases.\\nFinally, we carry out a detailed comparison of our BEDA results with those\\nobtained by solving the QCD effective kinetic theory for intermediate values of\\n$\\\\alpha_s$, observing remarkably good quantitative agreement between the two\\napproaches.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:37:53Z\"}"}
