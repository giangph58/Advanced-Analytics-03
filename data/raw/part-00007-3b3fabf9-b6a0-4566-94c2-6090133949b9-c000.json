{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01613v1\", \"title\": \"The Mini-SiTian Array: Design and application of Master Control System\", \"summary\": \"The SiTian Project represents a groundbreaking initiative in astronomy,\\naiming to deploy a global network of telescopes, each with a 1-meter aperture,\\nfor comprehensive time-domain sky surveys. The network's innovative\\narchitecture features multiple observational nodes, each comprising three\\nstrategically aligned telescopes equipped with filters. This design enables\\nthree-color (g, r, i) channel imaging within each node, facilitating precise\\nand coordinated observations. As a pathfinder to the full-scale project, the\\nMini-SiTian Project serves as the scientific and technological validation\\nplatform, utilizing three 30-centimeter aperture telescopes to validate the\\nmethodologies and technologies planned for the broader SiTian network. This\\npaper focuses on the development and implementation of the Master Control\\nSystem (MCS),and the central command hub for the Mini-SiTian array. The MCS is\\ndesigned to facilitate seamless communication with the SiTian Brain, the\\nproject's central processing and decision-making unit, while ensuring accurate\\ntask allocation, real-time status monitoring, and optimized observational\\nworkflows. The system adopts a robust architecture that separates front-end and\\nback-end functionalities.A key innovation of the MCS is its ability to\\ndynamically adjust observation plans in response to transient source alerts,\\nenabling rapid and coordinated scans of target sky regions...(abridged)\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:26:11Z\"}"}
