{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12089v1\", \"title\": \"Accelerating MCMC with Quantum Walks: Design, Implementation, and\\n  Results\", \"summary\": \"Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are algorithms for sampling\\nprobability distributions, often applied to the Boltzmann distribution in\\nphysical and chemical models, such as protein folding and the Ising model.\\nThese methods enable the study of such systems by sampling their most probable\\nstates. However, sampling multidimensional and multimodal distributions with\\nMCMC demands significant computational resources, leading to the development of\\ntechniques aimed at improving sampling efficiency. In this context, quantum\\ncomputing, with its potential to accelerate classical methods, emerges as a\\npromising solution to the sampling problem. In this work, we present the design\\nand implementation of a novel MCMC algorithm (QMCMC) based on the Discrete\\nQuantum Walk (DQW) algorithm. We test several Gaussian distributions, including\\nmixtures and demonstrate that it effectively captures the structure of the\\ntarget distribution by leveraging quantum superposition. In addition, we\\nintroduce a circuit extension that significantly improves convergence speed,\\nwhich in turn enhances the scalability of the algorithm.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T13:53:32Z\"}"}
