For instance, the Sylvester sequence is uniquely characterized as the\\nonly sequence with $a_n^2/a_{n+1}\\\\in [2/3,4/3]$ whose reciprocal sum is equal\\nto $1$. This result has applications to irrationality problems. We prove that\\nfor almost every real number $\\\\alpha > 1$, sequences asymptotic to\\n$\\\\alpha^{2^n}$ have irrational reciprocal sums. Furthermore, our observations\\nprovide heuristic insight into an open problem by Erd\\\\H{o}s and Graham.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T11:47:29Z\"}"}
