{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13135v1\", \"title\": \"Probing CP-Violating Neutral Triple Gauge Couplings at Electron-Positron\\n  Colliders\", \"summary\": \"We study the forms of CP-violating (CPV) neutral triple gauge couplings\\n(nTGCs) that can be realized via dimension-8 operators in the Standard Model\\nEffective Field Theory (SMEFT). We present a new formulation of the CPV nTGC\\nform factors that is compatible with the spontaneous breaking of the\\nelectroweak gauge symmetry, and show how these CPV form factors can be matched\\nconsistently with the corresponding dimension-8 CPV nTGC operators in the\\nbroken phase. We then study probes of the CPV nTGCs at future high-energy\\n$e^+e^-$ colliders with centre-of-mass energies $\\\\sqrt{s} = (0.25, 0.5,1, 3,\\n5)$TeV respectively, demonstrating that the $e^{\\\\mp}$ beam polarizations can\\nhelp to improve the sensitivities of probes of the nTGCs. We estimate that the\\nsensitivities for probing the new physics scales of the nTGCs can range from\\n${O}(\\\\rm{TeV})$ at a 250GeV $e^+e^-$ collider to ${O}(10\\\\rm{TeV})$ at a 5TeV\\n$e^+e^-$ collider, and that the sensitivities to form factors range from\\n${O}(10^{-4})$ to ${O}(10^{-8})$.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:47:54Z\"}"}
