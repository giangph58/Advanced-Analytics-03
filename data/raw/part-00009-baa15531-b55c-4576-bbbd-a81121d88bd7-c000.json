However, existing datasets often lack fine-grained\\nannotations, particularly regarding rib fracture characterization, type, and\\nprecise anatomical location on individual ribs. To address this, we introduce a\\nnovel rib fracture annotation protocol tailored for fracture classification.\\nFurther, we enhance fracture classification by leveraging cross-modal\\nembeddings that bridge radiological images and clinical descriptions. Our\\napproach employs hyperbolic embeddings to capture the hierarchical nature of\\nfracture, mapping visual features and textual descriptions into a shared\\nnon-Euclidean manifold. This framework enables more nuanced similarity\\ncomputations between imaging characteristics and clinical descriptions,\\naccounting for the inherent hierarchical relationships in fracture taxonomy.\\nExperimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods\\nacross multiple classification tasks, with average recall improvements of 6% on\\nthe AirRib dataset and 17.5% on the public RibFrac dataset.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T05:47:09Z\"}"}
