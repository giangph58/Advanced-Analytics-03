We use the standard\\nSchwinger-DeWitt local expansion of the Feynman propagator, appropriate to\\nprobe the effect of spacetime curvature on the local or short scale physics.\\nRecently it was shown using perturbative computations that such SSB is possible\\nwith a scalar with a quartic self interaction, positive rest mass squared and\\npositive non-minimal coupling. Here we confirm in the two loop Hartree\\napproximation that curvature can indeed induce SSB for such a theory. SSB for\\nsuch a model is not possible in a flat spacetime. The 2PI technique does not\\nonly resum the self energy resulting in mass generation, but also resums, as we\\nhave discussed, curvature terms through such mass generation. We have\\nexplicitly discussed our results in the context of the de Sitter spacetime,\\nalthough our calculations are valid for any non-singular curved spacetime. We\\nshow that, in contrast to the perturbative results, SSB is possible with a\\nvanishing non-minimal coupling. These results are further extended to the case\\nof an $O(N)$ symmetric scalar field theory. Restoration of the broken symmetry\\nin the thermal case is also briefly discussed.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T10:00:31Z\"}"}
