Hyperbolic\\nequilibrium and stability patterns are then identified and classified according\\nto the associated (nonlinear) AAH Hamiltonian parameters. Besides providing the\\ntools for quantifying the information content of AAH systems, the Wigner flow\\npatterns here discussed suggest a systematic procedure for identifying the role\\nof quantum fluctuations over equilibrium and stability, in a framework which\\ncan be straightforwardly extended to describe the evolution of similar/modified\\nAAH systems.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T09:58:20Z\"}"}
