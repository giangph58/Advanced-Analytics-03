{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21665v1\", \"title\": \"Non-quasicontinuous Newtonian functions and outer capacities based on\\n  Banach function spaces\", \"summary\": \"We construct various examples of Sobolev-type functions, defined via upper\\ngradients in metric spaces, that fail to be quasicontinuous or weakly\\nquasicontinuous. This is done with quasi-Banach function lattices $X$ as the\\nfunction spaces defining the smoothness of the Sobolev-type functions. These\\nresults are in contrast to the case $X=L^p$ with $1\\\\le p<\\\\infty$, where all\\nSobolev-type functions in $N^p$ are known to be quasicontinuous, provided that\\nthe underlying metric space $\\\\mathcal{P}$ is locally complete. In most of our\\nexamples, $\\\\mathcal{P}$ is a compact subset of $\\\\mathbf{R}^2$ and $X=L^\\\\infty$.\\nFour particular examples are the damped topologist's sine curve, the von Koch\\nsnowflake curve, the Cantor ternary set and the Sierpi\\\\'nski carpet. We also\\ndiscuss several related properties, such as whether the Sobolev capacity is an\\nouter capacity, and how these properties are related. A fundamental role in\\nthese considerations is played by the lack of the Vitali--Carath\\\\'eodory\\nproperty.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T16:32:52Z\"}"}
