This work analyzes the integration of PQC into X.509\\ncertificate structures and compares existing tool support for classical,\\nhybrid, composite, and chameleon certificates. A gap is identified in available\\nopen-source solutions, particularly for the generation and validation of hybrid\\nand composite certificates via command-line interfaces. To address this, a\\nproof-of-concept implementation based on the Bouncy Castle library is\\ndeveloped. The tool supports the creation of classical, hybrid (Catalyst),\\ncomposite, and partially chameleon certificates using PQC algorithms such as\\nML-DSA and SLH-DSA. It demonstrates compatibility with standard X.509 workflows\\nand aims to support headless operation and constrained platforms typical of\\nindustrial systems. The implementation is modular, publicly available, and\\nintended to facilitate further research and testing of PQC migration strategies\\nin practice. A comparison with OpenSSL-based solutions highlights current\\nlimitations in standardization, toolchain support, and algorithm coverage.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T11:28:35Z\"}"}
