Antiferromagnetic insulators exhibit\\nsignificant potential for facilitating ultrafast pure spin currents by\\nterahertz magnons. Consequently, we here use femtosecond laser pulses to\\ntrigger ultrafast spin currents across antiferromagnetic NiO thin films in\\nPy|NiO|Pt stacks, where permalloy (Py) and Pt serve as spin-current source and\\ndetector respectively. We find that the spin current pulses traversing NiO\\nreach a velocity up to 40 nm/ps and experience increasing delay and broadening\\nas the NiO thickness is increased. We can consistently explain our observations\\nby ballistic transport of incoherent magnon. Our approach has high potential to\\ncharacterize terahertz magnon transport in magnetic insulators with any kind of\\nmagnetic order.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T12:09:55Z\"}"}
