{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10186v1\", \"title\": \"Entanglement-Enabled Connectivity Bounds for Quantum Networks\", \"summary\": \"In the Quantum Internet, multipartite entanglement enables a new form of\\nnetwork connectivity, referred to as artificial connectivity namely and able to\\naugment the physical connectivity with artificial links between pairs of nodes,\\nwithout any additional physical link deployment. In this paper, by engineering\\nsuch an artificial connectivity, we theoretically determine upper and lower\\nbounds for the number of EPR pairs and GHZ states that can be extracted among\\nnodes that are not adjacent in the artificial network topology. The\\naforementioned analysis is crucial, since the extraction of EPR pairs and GHZ\\nstates among remote nodes constitutes the resource primitives for on-demand and\\nend-to-end communications. Indeed, within the paper, we not only determine\\nwhether a certain number of remote EPR pairs and GHZ states can be extracted,\\nbut we also provide the locations, namely the identities, of the nodes\\ninterconnected by such entangled resources. Thus, our analysis is far from\\nbeing purely theoretical, rather it is constructive, since we provide the\\nsequence of operations required for performing such extractions.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T12:39:25Z\"}"}
