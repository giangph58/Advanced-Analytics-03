We then introduce a novel localization measure for functions on\\nbounded subsets of $\\\\mathbf{R}^d$, $d=1,2,3,\\\\dots$, based on a Wasserstein\\nmetric. For efficient computation, we prove the equality of this measure with a\\nsuitable Sobolev norm in dimension one. We demonstrate our approach by\\nnumerical experiments in one and two dimensions. Finally, we discuss and\\nmitigate challenges arising from boundary effects.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T12:47:01Z\"}"}
