Quadratic discriminant analysis will often lead to singular or\\nunstable covariance matrix estimates. Both of these methods can lead to\\nlower-than-desired classification performance. We introduce a novel,\\nmodel-based clustering method that can relax the shared covariance assumptions\\nof LDA by clustering sample covariance matrices, either singular or\\nnon-singular. In addition, we study the statistical properties of parameter\\nestimates. This will lead to covariance matrix estimates which are pooled\\nwithin each cluster of classes. We show, using simulated and real data, that\\nour classification method tends to yield better discrimination compared to\\nother methods.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T17:19:12Z\"}"}
