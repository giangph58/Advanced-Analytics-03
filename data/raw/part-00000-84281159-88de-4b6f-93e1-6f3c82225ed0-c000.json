Optically probing and\\ncontrolling them can reveal important information such as symmetry and\\ndynamics, but have so far been challenging due to the small energy gap compared\\nto optical wavelengths. Here, we report near infrared optical control of\\norbital magnetism and associated anomalous Hall effects (AHE) in a magic angle\\ntwisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) on monolayer WSe$_2$ device. We show that the\\nproperties of the AHE, such as hysteresis and amplitude, can be controlled by\\nlight near integer moir\\\\'e fillings, where spontaneous ferromagnetism exists.\\nBy modulating the light helicity, we observe periodic modulation of the\\ntransverse resistance in a wide range of fillings, indicating light induced\\norbital magnetization through a large inverse Faraday effect. At the transition\\nbetween metallic and AHE regimes, we also reveal large and random switching of\\nthe Hall resistivity, which are attributed to optical control of percolating\\ncluster of magnetic domains. Our results open the door to optical manipulation\\nof correlation and topology in MATBG and related structures.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:56:23Z\"}"}
