While they can generate vast amounts of datasets, only a subset\\nmeaningfully improves performance. We propose a novel end-to-end framework that\\ngenerates and systematically filters synthetic data through domain-specific\\nstatistical methods, selectively integrating high-quality samples for effective\\naugmentation. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in predictive\\nperformance across various settings, highlighting the potential of our\\nframework while underscoring the inherent limitations of generative models for\\ndata augmentation. Despite the ability to produce large volumes of synthetic\\ndata, the proportion that effectively improves model performance is limited.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ML\", \"categories\": \"stat.ML,cs.LG,stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T06:55:22Z\"}"}
