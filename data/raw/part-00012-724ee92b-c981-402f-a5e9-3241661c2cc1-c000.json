For some Hamiltonians of the Universe, such as those including an\\ninteraction term with the clock, the dynamics is substantially altered and can\\nbe non-unitary. This work derives necessary and sufficient conditions for the\\nrelative dynamics to be unitary and finds the general form of the unitary\\nevolution operator. A physical interpretation of these conditions is given in\\nterms of the clock's rate. Unitary dynamics is associated with rates that are\\nconstant in time and independent of the clock's internal structure.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T10:31:25Z\"}"}
