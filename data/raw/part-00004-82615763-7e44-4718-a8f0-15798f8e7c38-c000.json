Deep\\nlearning methods offer state-of-the-art performance but often require\\nsensor-specific training when used in a supervised setting. A promising\\nalternative is given by plug-and-play (PnP) methods, which consist in learning\\nonly a regularization through a denoiser, allowing to restore images from\\nseveral sources with the same network. This paper introduces PG-DPIR, an\\nefficient PnP method for high-count Poisson-Gaussian inverse problems, adapted\\nfrom DPIR. While DPIR is designed for white Gaussian noise, a naive adaptation\\nto Poisson-Gaussian noise leads to prohibitively slow algorithms due to the\\nabsence of a closed-form proximal operator. To address this, we adapt DPIR for\\nthe specificities of Poisson-Gaussian noise and propose in particular an\\nefficient initialization of the gradient descent required for the proximal step\\nthat accelerates convergence by several orders of magnitude. Experiments are\\nconducted on satellite image restoration and super-resolution problems.\\nHigh-resolution realistic Pleiades images are simulated for the experiments,\\nwhich demonstrate that PG-DPIR achieves state-of-the-art performance with\\nimproved efficiency, which seems promising for on-ground satellite processing\\nchains.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG,eess.IV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:23:15Z\"}"}
