To address these challenges, we present PAFA\\n(Principle-Aware Fashion), a multi-granular knowledge base that organizes\\nprofessional styling expertise into three levels of metadata, domain\\nprinciples, and semantic relationships. Using PAFA, we develop StePO-Rec, a\\nknowledge-guided method for multi-step outfit recommendation. StePO-Rec\\nprovides structured suggestions using a scenario-dimension-attribute framework,\\nemploying recursive tree construction to align recommendations with both\\nprofessional principles and individual preferences. A preference-trend\\nre-ranking system further adapts to fashion trends while maintaining the\\nconsistency of the user's original style. Experiments on the widely used\\npersonalized outfit dataset IQON show a 28% increase in Recall@1 and 32.8% in\\nMAP. Furthermore, case studies highlight improved explainability, traceability,\\nresult reliability, and the seamless integration of expertise and\\npersonalization.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR,cs.MM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T06:24:56Z\"}"}
