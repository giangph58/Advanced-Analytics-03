This method is known as Markov\\nclustering, which not only automatically performs grouping but also allows\\nflexible tuning the sizes of the resulting clusters using a single parameter.\\nCompared to the existing abstraction-based approach that lacks effective\\ngrouping method for general cases, our proposed approach based on Markov\\nclustering provides a fully automated and effective hierarchical synthesis\\nprocedure applicable to general large-scale DES. Moreover, it is proved that\\nthe resulting hierarchy of supervisors and coordinators collectively achieves\\nglobal nonblocking (and maximally permissive) controlled behavior under the\\nsame conditions as those in the existing abstraction-based approach. Finally, a\\nbenchmark case study is conducted to empirically demonstrate the effectiveness\\nof our approach.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T05:16:30Z\"}"}
