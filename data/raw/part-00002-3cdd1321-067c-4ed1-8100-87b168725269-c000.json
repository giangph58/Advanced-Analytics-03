{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03398v1\", \"title\": \"Benchmark-based Study of CPU/GPU Power-Related Features through JAX and\\n  TensorFlow\", \"summary\": \"Power management has become a crucial focus in the modern computing\\nlandscape, considering that {\\\\em energy} is increasingly recognized as a\\ncritical resource. This increased the importance of all topics related to {\\\\em\\nenergy-aware computing}. This paper presents an experimental study of three\\nprevalent power management techniques that are {\\\\em power limitation, frequency\\nlimitation}, and {\\\\em ACPI/P-State governor modes} (OS states related to power\\nconsumption). Through a benchmark approach with a set of six computing kernels,\\nwe investigate {\\\\em power/performance} trade-off with various hardware units\\nand software frameworks (mainly TensorFlow and JAX). Our experimental results\\nshow that {\\\\em frequency limitation} is the most effective technique to improve\\n{\\\\em Energy-Delay Product (EDP)}, which is a convolution of energy and running\\ntime. We also observe that running at the highest frequency compared to a\\nreduced one could lead to a reduction of factor $\\\\frac{1}{10}$ in EDP. Another\\nnoticeable fact is that frequency management shows a consistent behavior with\\ndifferent CPUs, whereas opposite effects sometimes occur between TensorFlow\\n(TF) and JAX with the same power management settings.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.PF\", \"categories\": \"cs.PF\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T10:26:57Z\"}"}
