{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19620v1\", \"title\": \"From local to collective superconductivity in proximitized graphene\", \"summary\": \"The superconducting proximity effect induces pairing correlations in metallic\\nsystems via Andreev scattering. This effect is particularly intriguing in\\ngraphene, as it enables two-dimensional superconductivity that is tunable\\nthrough doping. Understanding how superconducting correlations propagate within\\nthe metal is crucial to unveiling the key factors behind this tunability. Here,\\nwe employ scanning tunneling microscopy to investigate the energy and length\\nscales of the proximity effect induced by Pb islands on graphene. Using\\ntip-induced manipulation, we assemble S/N/S junctions with tunable N-region\\nspacing and explore the evolution of the proximitized state in the confined\\nnormal region. We find that different doping levels can lead to either\\nlocalized or collective superconducting states. By combining our experimental\\nresults with quasiclassical theory, we demonstrate that interface conductance\\nplays a key role in determining the strength and coherence length of pairing\\ncorrelations and inter-island coupling. Our findings provide new insights into\\nthe design of novel superconducting states and the control of their properties.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T09:28:08Z\"}"}
