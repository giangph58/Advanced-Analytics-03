The experimental flux\\nwas $1.2 \\\\cdot 10^3$ photons per shot, which was comparable to simulations.\\nAdditionally, the continuous tunability of photon energy and x-ray polarization\\ncontrol possible with the source are shown. The measured x-ray pulse length was\\nin the picosecond range. By increasing experimental parameters, implementing\\nimprovements and further conditioning of the accelerator structure, an expected\\nbrilliance of $10^{12}$ photons/(s $\\\\times$ mrad$^2$ $\\\\times$ mm${^{2}}$\\n$\\\\times$ 0.1\\\\% BW) is expected, while maximum photon energies can go to 40 keV.\\nSince the complete electron beamline will fit on a single optical table, it is\\nsuitable as in-house x-ray source for e.g. research institutes, companies,\\nmuseums, and hospitals.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.acc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.acc-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T09:23:50Z\"}"}
