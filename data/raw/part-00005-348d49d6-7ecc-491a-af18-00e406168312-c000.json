One interpretation is\\nphrased in terms of the Wronski map, while the other interpretation relates to\\nthe fundamental forms of the hypersurface. These local types are the local\\ncontributions of an quadratic form-valued Euler number that depends on a choice\\nof orientation.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:07:25Z\"}"}
