{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00690v1\", \"title\": \"Towards Autonomous Micromobility through Scalable Urban Simulation\", \"summary\": \"Micromobility, which utilizes lightweight mobile machines moving in urban\\npublic spaces, such as delivery robots and mobility scooters, emerges as a\\npromising alternative to vehicular mobility. Current micromobility depends\\nmostly on human manual operation (in-person or remote control), which raises\\nsafety and efficiency concerns when navigating busy urban environments full of\\nunpredictable obstacles and pedestrians. Assisting humans with AI agents in\\nmaneuvering micromobility devices presents a viable solution for enhancing\\nsafety and efficiency. In this work, we present a scalable urban simulation\\nsolution to advance autonomous micromobility. First, we build URBAN-SIM - a\\nhigh-performance robot learning platform for large-scale training of embodied\\nagents in interactive urban scenes. URBAN-SIM contains three critical modules:\\nHierarchical Urban Generation pipeline, Interactive Dynamics Generation\\nstrategy, and Asynchronous Scene Sampling scheme, to improve the diversity,\\nrealism, and efficiency of robot learning in simulation. Then, we propose\\nURBAN-BENCH - a suite of essential tasks and benchmarks to gauge various\\ncapabilities of the AI agents in achieving autonomous micromobility.\\nURBAN-BENCH includes eight tasks based on three core skills of the agents:\\nUrban Locomotion, Urban Navigation, and Urban Traverse. We evaluate four robots\\nwith heterogeneous embodiments, such as the wheeled and legged robots, across\\nthese tasks. Experiments on diverse terrains and urban structures reveal each\\nrobot's strengths and limitations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T17:52:29Z\"}"}
