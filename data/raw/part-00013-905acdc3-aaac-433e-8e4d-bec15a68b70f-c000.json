{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05875v1\", \"title\": \"Gravitational waves from primordial black hole dominance: The effect of\\n  inflaton decay rate\", \"summary\": \"In this work, we explore primordial black holes (PBH) formation scenario\\nduring the post-inflationary preheating stage dominated by the inflaton field.\\nWe consider, in particular, a model-independent parametrization of the Gaussian\\npeak inflationary power spectrum that leads to amplified inflationary density\\nfluctuations before the end of inflation. These modes can reenter the horizon\\nduring preheating and could experience instabilities that trigger the\\nproduction of PBH. This is estimated with the Khlopov-Polnarev (KP) formalism\\nthat takes into account non-spherical effects. We derive an accurate analytical\\nexpression for the mass fraction under the KP formalism that fits well with the\\nnumerical evaluation. Particularly, we focus on ultra-light PBH of masses\\n$M_{\\\\text{PBH}}<10^9g$ and study their evolution and (possible) dominance after\\nthe decay of the inflation field into radiation and before the PBH evaporation\\nvia Hawking radiation. These considerations alter the previous estimates of\\ninduced gravitational waves (GWs) from PBH dominance and open new windows for\\ndetecting stochastic GW backgrounds with future detectors.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:58:47Z\"}"}
