{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21300v1\", \"title\": \"A decomposition lemma in convex integration via classical algebraic\\n  geometry\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we introduce a decomposition lemma that allows error terms to\\nbe expressed using fewer primitive matrices than $\\\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ within the\\nconvex integration scheme of constructing flexible $C^{1,\\\\alpha}$ solutions to\\na system of nonlinear PDEs in dimension $n\\\\geq 2$, which can be viewed as a\\nkind of truncation of the codimension one local isometric embedding equation in\\nNash-Kuiper Theorem. This leads to flexible solutions with higher H\\\\\\\"older\\nregularity, and consequently, improved very weak solutions to certain induced\\nequations for any $n$, including Monge-Amp\\\\`ere systems and $2$-Hessian\\nsystems. The H\\\\\\\"older exponent of the solutions can be taken as any $\\\\alpha\\n<(n^2+1)^{-1}$ for $n=2,4,8,16$, and any\\n$\\\\alpha<(n^2+n-2\\\\rho(\\\\frac{n}{2})-1)^{-1}$ for other $n$, thereby improving the\\npreviously known bound $\\\\alpha<(n^2+n+1)^{-1}$ for $n\\\\geq 3$. Here, $\\\\rho(n)$\\nis the Radon-Hurwitz number, which exhibits an $8$-fold periodicity on $n$ that\\nis related to Bott periodicity.\\n  Our arguments involve novel applications of several results from algebraic\\ngeometry and topology, including Adams' theorem on maximum linearly independent\\nvector fields on spheres, the intersection of projective varieties, and\\nprojective duality. We also use an elliptic method ingeniously that avoids loss\\nof differentiability.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math.AG,math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T04:19:09Z\"}"}
