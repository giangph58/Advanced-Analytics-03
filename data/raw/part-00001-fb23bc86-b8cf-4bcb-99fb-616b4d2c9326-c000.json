We imaged every kernel\\npre-exposure to moisture and every 24 hours after exposure to moisture for five\\nconsecutive days. Every barley kernel was labeled as germinated or not\\ngerminated during each image acquisition. The barley kernels were imaged with\\nblack filter paper as the background, facilitating straight-forward intensity\\nthreshold-based segmentation, e.g., by Otsu's method. This dataset facilitates\\ntime series analysis of germination time for barley kernels using either RGB\\nimage analysis, NIR spectral analysis, NIR-HSI analysis, or a combination\\nhereof.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T12:25:55Z\"}"}
