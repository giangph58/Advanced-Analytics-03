{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21685v1\", \"title\": \"Enhancing Health Mention Classification Performance: A Study on\\n  Advancements in Parameter Efficient Tuning\", \"summary\": \"Health Mention Classification (HMC) plays a critical role in leveraging\\nsocial media posts for real-time tracking and public health monitoring.\\nNevertheless, the process of HMC presents significant challenges due to its\\nintricate nature, primarily stemming from the contextual aspects of health\\nmentions, such as figurative language and descriptive terminology, rather than\\nexplicitly reflecting a personal ailment. To address this problem, we argue\\nthat clearer mentions can be achieved through conventional fine-tuning with\\nenhanced parameters of biomedical natural language methods (NLP). In this\\nstudy, we explore different techniques such as the utilisation of\\npart-of-speech (POS) tagger information, improving on PEFT techniques, and\\ndifferent combinations thereof. Extensive experiments are conducted on three\\nwidely used datasets: RHDM, PHM, and Illness. The results incorporated POS\\ntagger information, and leveraging PEFT techniques significantly improves\\nperformance in terms of F1-score compared to state-of-the-art methods across\\nall three datasets by utilising smaller models and efficient training.\\nFurthermore, the findings highlight the effectiveness of incorporating POS\\ntagger information and leveraging PEFT techniques for HMC. In conclusion, the\\nproposed methodology presents a potentially effective approach to accurately\\nclassifying health mentions in social media posts while optimising the model\\nsize and training efficiency.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:21:54Z\"}"}
