This paper addresses the optimization of the\\ndynamic time-splitting ratio and flight trajectory for a communication system\\nlinking a ground base station to the UAV equipped with backscatter devices\\n(referred to as UB), and from UB to an end user. Given the inherent\\nnon-convexity of the problem, we develop two meta-heuristic-based approaches\\ninspired by genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization to enhance the\\ntotal achievable rate while reducing computational complexity. Numerical\\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of these meta-heuristic solutions,\\nshowcasing significant improvements in the achievable rate and computation time\\ncompared to existing benchmarks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T04:39:29Z\"}"}
