The LPA\\nLPI radio telescope with an operating frequency of 111 MHz was used for\\nobservations. According to our estimates, the characteristic time of\\nvariability for both sources is 1.5-2.5 years. It is shown that the observed\\nvariability is not related to intrinsic variations in the radiation flux, but\\nis due to refractive scintillation on inhomogeneities of the interstellar\\nmedium. From the obtained upper estimates of the apparent angular dimensions of\\nthe sources, it follows that the main contribution to the scattering of radio\\nemission is made by turbulent plasma concentrated in sufficiently thin screens,\\nthe distance to which does not exceed 300-400 pc.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T11:39:44Z\"}"}
