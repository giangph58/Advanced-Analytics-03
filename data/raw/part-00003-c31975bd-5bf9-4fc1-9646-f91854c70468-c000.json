In this work,\\nwe present a generalized framework of adaptive QGE algorithm, and further\\npropose two variants which enable us to estimate the collective properties of\\nfermionic systems using the smallest cost among existing quantum algorithms.\\nThe first method utilizes the symmetry inherent in the target state, and the\\nsecond method enables estimation in a single-shot manner using the parallel\\nscheme. We show that our proposal offers a quadratic speedup compared with\\nprior QGE algorithms in the task of fermionic partial tomography for systems\\nwith limited particle numbers. Furthermore, we provide the numerical\\ndemonstration that, for a problem of estimating fermionic 2-RDMs, our proposals\\nimprove the number of queries to the target state preparation oracle by a\\nfactor of 100 for the nitrogenase FeMo cofactor and by a factor of 500 for\\nFermi-Hubbard model of 100 sites.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T17:57:19Z\"}"}
