{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05175v1\", \"title\": \"Planar fault-tolerant circuits for non-Clifford gates on the 2D color\\n  code\", \"summary\": \"We introduce a family of scalable planar fault-tolerant circuits that\\nimplement logical non-Clifford operations on a 2D color code, such as a logical\\n$T$ gate or a logical non-Pauli measurement that prepares a magic $|T\\\\rangle$\\nstate. The circuits are relatively simple, consisting only of physical $T$\\ngates, $CX$ gates, and few-qubit measurements. They can be implemented with an\\narray of qubits on a 2D chip with nearest-neighbor couplings, and no wire\\ncrossings. The construction is based on a spacetime path integral\\nrepresentation of a non-Abelian 2+1D topological phase, which is related to the\\n3D color code. We turn the path integral into a circuit by expressing it as a\\nspacetime $ZX$ tensor network, and then traversing it in some chosen time\\ndirection. We describe in detail how fault tolerance is achieved using a\\n\\\"just-in-time\\\" decoding strategy, for which we repurpose and extend\\nstate-of-the-art color-code matching decoders.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T12:23:22Z\"}"}
