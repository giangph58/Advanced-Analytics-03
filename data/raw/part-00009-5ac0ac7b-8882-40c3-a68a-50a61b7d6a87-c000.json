{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06026v1\", \"title\": \"Taking out the Toxic Trash: Recovering Precision in Mixed Flow-Sensitive\\n  Static Analyses\", \"summary\": \"Static analysis of real-world programs combines flow- and context-sensitive\\nanalyses of local program states with computation of flow- and\\ncontext-insensitive invariants at globals, that, e.g., abstract data shared by\\nmultiple threads. The values of locals and globals may mutually depend on each\\nother, with the analysis of local program states both making contributions to\\nglobals and querying their values. Usually, all contributions to globals are\\naccumulated during fixpoint iteration, with widening applied to enforce\\ntermination. Such flow-insensitive information often becomes unnecessarily\\nimprecise and can include superfluous contributions -- trash -- which, in turn,\\nmay be toxic to the precision of the overall analysis. To recover precision of\\nglobals, we propose techniques complementing each other: Narrowing on globals\\ndifferentiates contributions by origin; reluctant widening limits the amount of\\nwidening applied at globals; and finally, abstract garbage collection undoes\\ncontributions to globals and propagates their withdrawal. The experimental\\nevaluation shows that these techniques increase the precision of mixed\\nflow-sensitive analyses at a reasonable cost.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.PL\", \"categories\": \"cs.PL,cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:30:15Z\"}"}
