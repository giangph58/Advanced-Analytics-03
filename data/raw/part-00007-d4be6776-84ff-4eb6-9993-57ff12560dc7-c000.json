{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00552v1\", \"title\": \"Graph Spectral Filtering with Chebyshev Interpolation for Recommendation\", \"summary\": \"Graph convolutional networks have recently gained prominence in collaborative\\nfiltering (CF) for recommendations. However, we identify potential bottlenecks\\nin two foundational components. First, the embedding layer leads to a latent\\nspace with limited capacity, overlooking locally observed but potentially\\nvaluable preference patterns. Also, the widely-used neighborhood aggregation is\\nlimited in its ability to leverage diverse preference patterns in a\\nfine-grained manner. Building on spectral graph theory, we reveal that these\\nlimitations stem from graph filtering with a cut-off in the frequency spectrum\\nand a restricted linear form. To address these issues, we introduce ChebyCF, a\\nCF framework based on graph spectral filtering. Instead of a learned embedding,\\nit takes a user's raw interaction history to utilize the full spectrum of\\nsignals contained in it. Also, it adopts Chebyshev interpolation to effectively\\napproximate a flexible non-linear graph filter, and further enhances it by\\nusing an additional ideal pass filter and degree-based normalization. Through\\nextensive experiments, we verify that ChebyCF overcomes the aforementioned\\nbottlenecks and achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple\\nbenchmarks and reasonably fast inference.
