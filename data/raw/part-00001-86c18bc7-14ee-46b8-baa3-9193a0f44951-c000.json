We first prove that every second-order stationary\\npoint of the factorized problem corresponds to an approximate stationary point\\nof its non-factorized counterpart, and those rank-deficient ones correspond to\\nglobal minimizers of the latter problem when $h$ is additionally convex,\\nconforming with the observations in [2, 15]. Next, discarding the rank\\ncondition on the second-order stationary points but assuming the convexity and\\nLipschitz differentiability of $h$, we characterize, with respect to some\\nnatural problem parameters, when every second-order stationary point of the\\nfactorized problem is a global minimizer of the corresponding nuclear\\nnorm-regularized problem. More precisely, we subdivide the class of Lipschitz\\ndifferentiable convex $C^2$ functions into subclasses according to those\\nnatural parameters and characterize when each subclass consists solely of\\nfunctions $h$ such that every second-order stationary point of the associated\\nfactorized model is a global minimizer of the nuclear norm regularized model.\\nIn particular, explicit counterexamples are established when the characterizing\\ncondition on the said parameters is violated.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T06:50:07Z\"}"}
