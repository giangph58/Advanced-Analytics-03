Here we\\npropose a microwave-activated three-qubit gate protocol for fixed-frequency\\ntransmon qubits in the large-detuning regime ($|\\\\Delta| \\\\gg g$), leveraging the\\nthird-order nonlinear interaction to coherently exchange $|001\\\\rangle\\n\\\\leftrightarrow |110\\\\rangle$ states. By incorporating a phase-compensated\\noptimization protocol, numerical simulations demonstrate a high average gate\\nfidelity exceeding $99.9\\\\%$. Systematic error analysis identifies static\\nlong-range ZZ coupling as the dominant error source in multi-qubit systems,\\nwhich can be suppressed via operations in the large-detuning regime ($\\\\sim 1$\\nGHz). This approach simultaneously enhances gate fidelity while preserving\\nspectral isolation, ensuring compatibility with existing all-microwave\\ncontrolled-Z gate frameworks. The protocol exhibits intrinsic robustness to\\nfabrication-induced qubit parameter variations. This hardware-efficient\\nstrategy advances scalable quantum computing systems by improving coherence\\nproperties, reducing spectral congestion, and expanding the experimental\\ntoolkit for error-resilient quantum operations in the noisy intermediate-scale\\nquantum era.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T06:16:16Z\"}"}
