Our method builds on our previous\\nwork on an entropy-stable discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method for\\nthe incompressible Navier-Stokes/Cahn-Hilliard system\\n\\\\cite{manzanero2020entropyNSCH}, and incorporates a modified weak\\ncompressibility formulation that allows different sound speeds in each phase.\\nWe validate our method through numerical experiments, demonstrating spectral\\nconvergence for acoustic transmission and reflection coefficients in one\\ndimension and for the angle defined by Snell's law in two dimensions. Special\\nattention is given to quantifying the modeling errors introduced by the width\\nof the diffuse interface. Our results show that the method successfully\\ncaptures the behavior of acoustic waves across interfaces, allowing exponential\\nconvergence in transmitted waves. The transmitted angles in two dimensions are\\naccurately captured for air-water conditions, up to the critical angle of\\n$13^\\\\circ$. This work represents a step forward in modeling acoustic\\npropagation in incompressible multiphase systems, with potential applications\\nto marine aeroacoustics.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA,physics.comp-ph,physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T13:33:55Z\"}"}
