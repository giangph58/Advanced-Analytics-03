The\\nsensitivity of this search is 2.2x10-13, a factor of 2.4 better than that of\\nthe full MEG dataset and obtained in a data taking period of about one fourth\\nthat of MEG, thanks to the superior performances of the new detector. The\\nresult is consistent with the expected background, yielding an upper limit on\\nthe branching ratio of B(\\\\mu+->e+\\\\gamma)<1.5 x 10-13 (90 % C.L.). Additional\\nimprovements are expected with the data collected during the years 2023-2024.\\nThe data-taking will continue in the coming years.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T08:53:35Z\"}"}
