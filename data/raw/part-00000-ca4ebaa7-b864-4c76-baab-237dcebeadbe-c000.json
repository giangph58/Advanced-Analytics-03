{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10147v1\", \"title\": \"A Survey of Personalization: From RAG to Agent\", \"summary\": \"Personalization has become an essential capability in modern AI systems,\\nenabling customized interactions that align with individual user preferences,\\ncontexts, and goals. Recent research has increasingly concentrated on\\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks and their evolution into more\\nadvanced agent-based architectures within personalized settings to enhance user\\nsatisfaction. Building on this foundation, this survey systematically examines\\npersonalization across the three core stages of RAG: pre-retrieval, retrieval,\\nand generation. Beyond RAG, we further extend its capabilities into the realm\\nof Personalized LLM-based Agents, which enhance traditional RAG systems with\\nagentic functionalities, including user understanding, personalized planning\\nand execution, and dynamic generation. For both personalization in RAG and\\nagent-based personalization, we provide formal definitions, conduct a\\ncomprehensive review of recent literature, and summarize key datasets and\\nevaluation metrics. Additionally, we discuss fundamental challenges,\\nlimitations, and promising research directions in this evolving field. Relevant\\npapers and resources are continuously updated at\\nhttps://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/Awesome-Personalized-RAG-Agent.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T11:57:52Z\"}"}
