More precisely, weak solutions\\nof the so-called graph-continuity equation are shown to be the push-forward of\\ntheir initial datum through the flow map solving the associated\\ncharacteristics' equation, which depends on the co-evolving graph considered.\\nThis connection can be used to prove contractions in a suitable distance,\\nalthough the flow on the graphs requires a too limiting assumption on the\\noverall flux. Therefore, we consider upwinding dynamics on graphs with\\npointwise and monotonic velocity and prove long-time convergence of the\\nsolutions towards the uniform mass distribution.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:36:55Z\"}"}
