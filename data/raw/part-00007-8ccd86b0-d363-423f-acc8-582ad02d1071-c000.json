{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10441v1\", \"title\": \"Position Uncertainty in a Prisoner's Dilemma Game : An Experiment\", \"summary\": \"Gallice and Monzon (2019) present a natural environment that sustains full\\ncooperation in one-shot social dilemmas among a finite number of\\nself-interested agents. They demonstrate that in a sequential public goods\\ngame, where agents lack knowledge of their position in the sequence but can\\nobserve some predecessors' actions, full contribution emerges in equilibrium\\ndue to agents' incentive to induce potential successors to follow suit.\\nFurthermore, they show that this principle extends to a number of social\\ndilemmas, with the prominent example that of the prisoner's dilemma. In this\\nstudy, we experimentally test the theoretical predictions of this model in a\\nmulti- player prisoner's dilemma environment, where subjects are not aware of\\ntheir position in the sequence and receive only partial information on past\\ncooperating actions. We test the predictions of the model, and through rigorous\\nstructural econometric analysis, we test the descriptive capacity of the model\\nagainst alternative behavioural strategies, such as conditional cooperation,\\naltruistic play and free-riding behaviour. We find that the majority resorts to\\nfree-riding behaviour, around 30% is classified as Gallice and Monzon (2019)\\ntypes, followed by those with social preference considerations and the\\nunconditional altruists.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:32:07Z\"}"}
