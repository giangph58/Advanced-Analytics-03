Forward-Backward (F-B)\\ncorrelation is one of the important probes to study such fluctuations. The\\nresults of F-B correlation are available in a wide range of energy, from STAR\\nof RHIC to ALICE of LHC. It will be more interesting to study the dynamical\\nfluctuation using F-B correlation at SIS100 energy too. In this study, an\\nattempt has been made to investigate the F-B correlation in UrQMD-hydro\\ngenerated data for 10 AGeV Au+Au collisions.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T10:36:45Z\"}"}
