We show that such generating function must be the\\nsum of a real-valued function and an odd function with imaginary component.\\nThis setting is different from the case of Hermitian complex Toeplitz matrices\\ngenerated by real-valued functions only. By using of 2-by-2 block complex\\nrepresentation of quaternion matrices, we give a quaternion version of\\nGrenander-Szeg\\\\\\\"{o} theorem stating the distribution of eigenvalues of\\nHermitian quaternion Toeplitz matrices in terms of its generating function. As\\nan application, we investigate Strang's circulant preconditioners for Hermitian\\nquaternion Toeplitz linear systems arising from quaternion signal processing.\\nWe show that Strang's circulant preconditioners can be diagionalized by\\ndiscrete quaternion Fourier transform matrices whereas general quaternion\\ncirculant matrices cannot be diagonalized by them. Also we verify the\\ntheoretical and numerical convergence results of Strang's circulant\\npreconditioned conjugate gradient method for solving Hermitian quaternion\\nToeplitz systems.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T13:03:21Z\"}"}
