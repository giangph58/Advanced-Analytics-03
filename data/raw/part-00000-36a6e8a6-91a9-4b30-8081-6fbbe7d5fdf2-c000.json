{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05087v1\", \"title\": \"Predictive Control of EV Overnight Charging with Multi-Session\\n  Flexibility\", \"summary\": \"The majority of electric vehicles (EVs) are charged domestically overnight,\\nwhere the precise timing of power allocation is not important to the user, thus\\nrepresenting a source of flexibility that can be leveraged by charging control\\nalgorithms. In this paper, we relax the common assumption, that EVs require\\nfull charge every morning, enabling additional flexibility to defer charging of\\nsurplus energy to subsequent nights, which can enhance the performance of\\ncontrolled charging. In particular, we consider a simple domestic smart plug,\\nscheduling power delivery with the objective to minimize CO$_2$ emissions over\\nprediction horizons of multiple sessions -- up to seven days ahead -- utilising\\nmodel predictive control (MPC). Based on carbon intensity data from the UK\\nNational Grid, we demonstrate significant potential for emission reductions\\nwith multi-session planning of 40 to 46\\\\% compared to uncontrolled charging and\\n19 to 26\\\\% compared to single-session planning. Furthermore, we assess, how the\\ndriving and charging behaviour of EV users affects the available flexibility\\nand consequentially the potential for emission reductions. Finally, using grid\\ncarbon intensity data from 14 different UK regions, we report significant\\nvariations in absolute emission reductions based on the local energy mix.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T09:35:27Z\"}"}
