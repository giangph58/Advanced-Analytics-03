A tunable bandwidth light\\nsource is exploited to achieve complementary momentum (P-pointer) and intensity\\n(I-pointer) measurements,enabling calibration-free operation across various\\nbandwidths, and to realize high-precision phase difference monitoring of the\\nmeasured membranes.This method maps the birefringence effect to a weak-value\\namplified signal of spectral shift and light intensity. The optimal resolution,\\nachieved at a spectral width of 6 nm, is $1.5 \\\\times 10^{-8}$ RIU, while the\\noptimal sensitivity is achieved when the light source is a narrow-linewidth\\ncoherent laser, reaching 4710 mV/RIU. The linear range of the system covers a\\nbroad birefringence coefficient range for crystals,from $10^{-6}$ to 0.1.\\nFurthermore, the auxiliary optical path eliminates substrate interference,\\nachieving a detection limit of the birefringence coefficient as low as\\n$10^{-8}$ RIU.This approach, characterized high precision, high sensitivity,\\nand strong robustness, provides an effective solution for the detection of\\noptical nano-thin membrane parameters.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T03:56:40Z\"}"}
