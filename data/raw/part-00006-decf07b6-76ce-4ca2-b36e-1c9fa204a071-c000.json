We investigated the\\nresilience of the A* algorithm in the face of potential adversarial\\ninterventions known as obstacle attacks. The adversary's goal is to delay the\\nrobot's timely arrival at its destination by introducing obstacles along its\\noriginal path.\\n  We developed malicious software to execute the attacks and conducted\\nexperiments to assess their impact, both in simulation using TurtleBot in\\nGazebo and in real-world deployment with the Unitree Go1 robot. In simulation,\\nthe attacks resulted in an average delay of 36\\\\%, with the most significant\\ndelays occurring in scenarios where the robot was forced to take substantially\\nlonger alternative paths. In real-world experiments, the delays were even more\\npronounced, with all attacks successfully rerouting the robot and causing\\nmeasurable disruptions. These results highlight that the algorithm's robustness\\nis not solely an attribute of its design but is significantly influenced by the\\noperational environment. For example, in constrained environments like tunnels,\\nthe delays were maximized due to the limited availability of alternative\\nroutes.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T15:48:26Z\"}"}
