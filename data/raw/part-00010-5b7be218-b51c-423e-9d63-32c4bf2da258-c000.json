{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21557v1\", \"title\": \"Optimizing carrier balance in CsPbBr3 nanocrystal LEDs: The role of\\n  alkyl ligands and polar electron transport layers\", \"summary\": \"The study of lead halide perovskite nanocrystal based light-emitting diodes\\n(LEDs) has advanced significantly, with notable improvements in stability and\\noptical properties. However, optimizing charge carrier injection and transport\\nremains a challenge. Efficient electroluminescence requires a balanced\\ntransport of both holes and electrons within the emitting material. Here, we\\ninvestigate cubic CsPbBr\\\\textsubscript{3} nanocrystals passivated with\\noleylamine and oleic acid, comparing them to ligand-exchanged nanocrystals with\\ndidodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDABr). Nuclear magnetic resonance\\nspectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy confirm successful ligand\\nexchange, revealing reduced ligand coverage in DDABr-treated nanocrystals.\\nPhotoelectron spectroscopy, spectroelectrochemistry, and single-carrier devices\\nindicate improved hole injection in DDABr-capped nanocrystals. Density\\nfunctional theory calculations further reveal the influence of ligand type and\\ncoverage on energy levels, with oleic acid introducing localized states in\\nnative nanocrystals. Additionally, incorporation of a polar electron transport\\nlayer (ETL) enhances LED performance by over an order of magnitude in\\nDDABr-capped nanocrystals, driven by improved charge balance arising from the\\nspontaneous orientation polarization (SOP) of the ETL. These findings highlight\\nthe critical role of ligand selection, passivation degree, and charge transport\\ncontrol by the adjacent organic transport layers in optimizing LED efficiency.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T11:54:43Z\"}"}
