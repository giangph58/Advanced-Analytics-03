{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00648v1\", \"title\": \"Adaptive Nonoverlapping Preconditioners for the Helmholtz Equation\", \"summary\": \"The Helmholtz equation poses significant computational challenges due to its\\noscillatory solutions, particularly for large wavenumbers. Inspired by the\\nSchur complement system for elliptic problems, this paper presents a novel\\nsubstructuring approach to mitigate the potential ill-posedness of local\\nDirichlet problems for the Helmholtz equation. We propose two types of\\npreconditioners within the framework of nonoverlapping spectral additive\\nSchwarz (NOSAS) methods. The first type of preconditioner focuses on the real\\npart of the Helmholtz problem, while the second type addresses both the real\\nand imaginary components, providing a comprehensive strategy to enhance\\nscalability and reduce computational cost. Our approach is purely algebraic,\\nwhich allows for adaptability to various discretizations and heterogeneous\\nHelmholtz coefficients while maintaining theoretical convergence for thresholds\\nclose to zero. Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed\\npreconditioners, demonstrating robust convergence rates and scalability, even\\nfor large wavenumbers.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T16:45:14Z\"}"}
