First, the class of locally matricial\\nalgebras over an arbitrary field is closed under extensions. Second, the class\\nof locally finite dimensional semisimple algebras over a fixed field is closed\\nunder extensions if and only if the base field is perfect. Regardless of the\\nbase field, extensions of the latter type are always locally unit-regular.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RA\", \"categories\": \"math.RA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T05:21:10Z\"}"}
