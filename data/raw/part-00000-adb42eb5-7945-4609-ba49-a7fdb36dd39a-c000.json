While the hadronic matrix element for\\n$h_{c}\\\\to \\\\eta_{c}\\\\gamma$ is obtained directly, the one relevant to\\n$h_{b}\\\\to\\\\eta_{b}\\\\gamma$ is reached by working with heavy quark masses\\n$m^{(n)}_{H} = \\\\lambda^{n-1} m_{c}$, with $\\\\lambda \\\\sim 1.24$ and $n=1,2,\\n\\\\ldots ,6$, and then extrapolated to $m_{b}$ by several judicious ans\\\\\\\"atze. In\\nthe continuum limit we obtain $\\\\Gamma( h_{c}\\\\to \\\\eta_{c} \\\\gamma ) =\\n0.604(24)~\\\\mathrm{MeV}$, which is by a factor of $2.3$ more accurate than the\\nprevious lattice estimates, and in good agreement with the experimental\\nmeasurement.
