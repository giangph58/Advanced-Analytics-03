High interference visibility of spatially multimode beams in unbalanced\\nMichelson or Mach-Zehnder interferometers with a relatively wide range of\\ndelays is achieved by the appropriate choice of the transverse size of the\\nbeam. We provide a simple theoretical model that gives a direct connection\\nbetween the visibility of interference, the delay, and the beam parameters. The\\nperformed experimental study confirms our theoretical findings and demonstrates\\nthe measured visibility of up to 0.95 for the delay of 2 ns. Our approach's\\nsimplicity and robust performance make it a practical choice for the\\nimplementation of QKD systems, where a quantum signal is received over a\\nmultimode fiber. The important application of such configuration is an\\nintermodal QKD system, where the free-space atmospheric communication channel\\nis coupled into a span of the multimode fiber, delivering the spatially\\ndistorted beam to the remote receiver with minimal coupling loss.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T06:30:40Z\"}"}
