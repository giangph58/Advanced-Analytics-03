A mixed finite element pair is employed to solve\\nthis model with nearly incompressible materials. This pair is quasi-stable with\\na logarithmic factor, which is not significant in the approximation error, and\\nconverges robustly in the incompressible limit and uniformly in the microscopic\\nmaterial parameter. Numerical results back up that the theoretical predictions\\nare nearly optimal. Moreover, the regularity estimates for the model over a\\nsmooth domain have been proved with the aid of the Agmon-Douglis-Nirenberg\\ntheory.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T09:08:57Z\"}"}
