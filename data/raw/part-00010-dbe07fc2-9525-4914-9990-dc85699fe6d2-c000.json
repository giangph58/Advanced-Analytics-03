{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11313v1\", \"title\": \"A Composed Alternating Relaxed Projection Algorithm for Feasibility\\n  Problem\", \"summary\": \"Feasibility problem aims to find a common point of two or more closed\\n(convex) sets whose intersection is nonempty. In the literature, projection\\nbased algorithms are widely adopted to solve the problem, such as the method of\\nalternating projection (MAP), and Douglas--Rachford splitting method (DR). The\\nperformance of the methods are governed by the geometric properties of the\\nunderlying sets. For example, the fixed-point sequence of the Douglas--Rachford\\nsplitting method exhibits a spiraling behavior when solving the feasibility\\nproblem of two subspaces, leading to a slow convergence speed and slower than\\nMAP. However, when the problem at hand is non-polyhedral, DR can demonstrate\\nsignificant faster performance. Motivated by the behaviors of the DR method, in\\nthis paper we propose a new algorithm for solving convex feasibility problems.\\nThe method is designed based on DR method by further incorporating a\\ncomposition of projection and reflection. A non-stationary version of the\\nmethod is also designed, aiming to achieve faster practical performance.\\nTheoretical guarantees of the proposed schemes are provided and supported by\\nnumerical experiments.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:53:10Z\"}"}
