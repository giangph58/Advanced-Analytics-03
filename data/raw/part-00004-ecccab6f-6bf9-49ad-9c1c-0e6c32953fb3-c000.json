Then we study the coboundary Zinbiel\\nbialgebras, which leads to an analogue of the classical Yang-Baxter equation.\\nMoreover, we introduce the notions of quasi-triangular and factorizable Zinbiel\\nbialgebras as special cases. A quasi-triangular Zinbiel bialgebra can give rise\\nto a relative Rota-Baxter operator of weight $-1$. A factorizable Zinbiel\\nbialgebra can give a factorization of the underlying Zinbiel algebra.\\n  As an example, we define the Zinbiel double of a Zinbiel bialgebra, which\\nenjoys a natural factorizable Zinbiel bialgebra structure. Finally, we\\nintroduce the notion of quadratic Rota-Baxter Zinbiel algebras, as the\\nRota-Baxter characterization of factorizable Zinbiel bialgebras. We show that\\nthere is a one-to-one correspondence between quadratic Rota-Baxter Zinbiel\\nalgebras and factorizable Zinbiel bialgebras.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RA\", \"categories\": \"math.RA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T13:34:18Z\"}"}
