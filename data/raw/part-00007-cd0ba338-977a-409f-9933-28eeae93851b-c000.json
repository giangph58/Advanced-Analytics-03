Therefore, coronal\\nmagnetic field models have to rely on extrapolation methods using photospheric\\nmagnetograms as boundary conditions. In recent years, due to the increased\\nresolution of observations and the need to resolve non-force-free lower regions\\nof the solar atmosphere, there have been increased efforts to use\\nmagnetohydrostatic (MHS) field models instead of force-free extrapolation\\nmethods. Although numerical methods to calculateMHS solutions can deal with\\nnon-linear problems and hence provide more accurate models, analytical\\nthree-dimensional MHS equilibria can also be used as a numerically relatively\\n\\\"cheap\\\" complementary method. In this paper, we present an extrapolation method\\nbased on a family of analytical MHS equilibria that allows for a transition\\nfrom a non-force-free region to a force-free region. We demonstrate how\\nasymptotic forms of the solutions can help to increase the numerical efficiency\\nof the method.
