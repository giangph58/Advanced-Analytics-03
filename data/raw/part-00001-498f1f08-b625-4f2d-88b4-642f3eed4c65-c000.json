{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17519v1\", \"title\": \"Replication and Exploration of Generative Retrieval over Dynamic Corpora\", \"summary\": \"Generative retrieval (GR) has emerged as a promising paradigm in information\\nretrieval (IR). However, most existing GR models are developed and evaluated\\nusing a static document collection, and their performance in dynamic corpora\\nwhere document collections evolve continuously is rarely studied. In this\\npaper, we first reproduce and systematically evaluate various representative GR\\napproaches over dynamic corpora. Through extensive experiments, we reveal that\\nexisting GR models with \\\\textit{text-based} docids show superior generalization\\nto unseen documents. We observe that the more fine-grained the docid design in\\nthe GR model, the better its performance over dynamic corpora, surpassing BM25\\nand even being comparable to dense retrieval methods. While GR models with\\n\\\\textit{numeric-based} docids show high efficiency, their performance drops\\nsignificantly over dynamic corpora. Furthermore, our experiments find that the\\nunderperformance of numeric-based docids is partly due to their excessive\\ntendency toward the initial document set, which likely results from overfitting\\non the training set. We then conduct an in-depth analysis of the\\nbest-performing GR methods. We identify three critical advantages of text-based\\ndocids in dynamic corpora: (i) Semantic alignment with language models'\\npretrained knowledge, (ii) Fine-grained docid design, and (iii) High lexical\\ndiversity. Building on these insights, we finally propose a novel multi-docid\\ndesign that leverages both the efficiency of numeric-based docids and the\\neffectiveness of text-based docids, achieving improved performance in dynamic\\ncorpus without requiring additional retraining. Our work offers empirical\\nevidence for advancing GR methods over dynamic corpora and paves the way for\\ndeveloping more generalized yet efficient GR models in real-world search\\nengines.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T13:01:23Z\"}"}
