Using a scheme in which a cloud of ultracold 87Rb is\\nco-trapped nearby, we improve the determination of the nuclear g factor, gI ,\\nof atomic 87Sr by more than two orders of magnitude, reaching accuracy at the\\nparts-per-million level. We achieve similar accuracy in the ratio of relevant g\\nfactors between Rb and Sr. This establishes ultracold 87Sr as an excellent\\nlinear in-vacuum magnetometer. These results are relevant for ongoing efforts\\ntowards quantum simulation, quantum computation and optical atomic clocks\\nemploying 87Sr, and these methods can also be applied to other alkaline-earth\\nand alkaline-earth-like atoms.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:43:03Z\"}"}
