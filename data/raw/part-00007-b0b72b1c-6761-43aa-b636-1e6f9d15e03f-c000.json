However, some\\nnumerical simulations have shown that the resulting distribution of electrons\\nis a combination of a thermal component and a non-thermal power-law component.\\nIn this paper, we investigate synchrotron circular polarization using such a\\nhybrid energy distribution of relativistic thermal and nonthermal electrons\\nwithin a globally toroidal magnetic field in GRB prompt optical emission. Our\\nresults show that compared to the solely nonthermal electron model, the\\nsynchrotron circular polarization degree (PD) in the hybrid electron model can\\nvary widely in the optical band, depending on different parameters. The lower\\nthe electron temperature, the higher the circular PD. The time-averaged\\ncircular PD in the hybrid electron model can be higher than $\\\\sim 1\\\\%$ when the\\nelectron temperature is as low as $\\\\sim 10^{10}$ K, while in the solely\\nnonthermal electron model is usually lower than $\\\\sim 1\\\\%$. We further\\ncalculate the radiative transfer of the circular and linear polarization in the\\noptical band. Our results show that both of the circular and linear PDs\\ndecrease with the increase of optical depth, but the linear PDs decline faster\\nthan the circular PDs. To further examine the physical mechanisms of both\\nradiation and particle acceleration, we expect that instruments will be capable\\nof measuring the circular polarization of GRB prompt optical emission in the\\nfuture.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:44:29Z\"}"}
