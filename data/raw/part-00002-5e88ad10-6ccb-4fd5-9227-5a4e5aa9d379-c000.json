We show that,\\ngiven preferences, there exist allocations that guarantee the efficiency of the\\nDA algorithm. Furthermore, it is equivalent to the FDA algorithm developed by\\nKamada and Kojima (2015), which endows the latter with an interpretation as a\\ntool for endogenous capacity design. Our proof applies the optimality within\\nthe matching with contracts (Hatfield and Milgrom 2005) framework, offering a\\nbroadly applicable method for establishing equivalence among DA-based\\nmechanisms.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.TH\", \"categories\": \"econ.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T12:00:34Z\"}"}
