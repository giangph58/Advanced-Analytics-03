We think differences have arisen not\\nin the experimental results themselves but in their interpretation: our more\\nextensive experiments allowed us to distinguish between \\\"true positive\\\" and\\n\\\"false positive\\\" results. We identify potential evidence of non-polaritonic\\neffects in Schwartz and Hutchison's own work. We hope our work will encourage\\nothers to produce more systematic investigations of strong coupling.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:01:20Z\"}"}
