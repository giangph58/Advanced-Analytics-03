As a\\nresult, recent efforts focus on instruction-tuning open-source LLMs, though the\\npotential of combining them with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains\\nunderexplored. To bridge this gap, we are the first to explore a knowledge\\ngraph-based (KG) RAG framework for Japanese medical QA small-scale open-source\\nLLMs. Experimental results show that KG-based RAG has only a limited impact on\\nJapanese medical QA using small-scale open-source LLMs. Further case studies\\nreveal that the effectiveness of the RAG is sensitive to the quality and\\nrelevance of the external retrieved content. These findings offer valuable\\ninsights into the challenges and potential of applying RAG in Japanese medical\\nQA, while also serving as a reference for other low-resource languages.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T08:46:39Z\"}"}
