Traditionally, a Cox regression model\\nis employed, concatenating various covariate types linearly. Given that much of\\nthe data may be redundant or irrelevant, feature selection through penalization\\nis often desirable. A notable characteristic of these datasets is their\\norganization into blocks of distinct data types, such as methylation and\\nclinical predictors, which requires selecting a subset of covariates from each\\ngroup due to high intra-group correlations. For this reason, we propose\\nutilizing Exclusive Lasso regularization in place of standard Lasso\\npenalization. We apply our methodology to a real-life cancer dataset,\\ndemonstrating enhanced survival prediction performance compared to the\\nconventional Cox regression model.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,stat.CO,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T09:07:05Z\"}"}
