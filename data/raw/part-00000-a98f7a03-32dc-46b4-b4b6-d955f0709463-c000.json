We demonstrate that BH formation via gravothermal\\ncollapse naturally occurs in high-concentration halos at a characteristic mass\\nscale determined by the SIDM cross section, and only during the early Universe.\\nThis mechanism is particularly promising for explaining the abundance of little\\nred dots (LRDs) -- a population of early, apparently galaxy-less active\\ngalactic nuclei hosting supermassive BHs. By incorporating this seeding process\\nwith simplified models of BH growth and mergers, we successfully reproduce the\\nobserved LRD mass function for moderately large cross sections of $\\\\sigma_{0m}\\n\\\\sim 30 \\\\mathrm{cm^2\\\\,g^{-1}}$ and $\\\\omega \\\\sim 80\\\\,\\\\mathrm{km\\\\,s^{-1}}$,\\nintriguingly consistent with independent local constraints derived from galaxy\\nrotation curves. Our results highlight the potential of high-redshift BH\\nstatistics as a complementary probe for constraining SIDM models.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T04:15:20Z\"}"}
