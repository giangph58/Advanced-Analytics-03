{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00394v1\", \"title\": \"SOTA: Spike-Navigated Optimal TrAnsport Saliency Region Detection in\\n  Composite-bias Videos\", \"summary\": \"Existing saliency detection methods struggle in real-world scenarios due to\\nmotion blur and occlusions. In contrast, spike cameras, with their high\\ntemporal resolution, significantly enhance visual saliency maps. However, the\\ncomposite noise inherent to spike camera imaging introduces discontinuities in\\nsaliency detection. Low-quality samples further distort model predictions,\\nleading to saliency bias. To address these challenges, we propose\\nSpike-navigated Optimal TrAnsport Saliency Region Detection (SOTA), a framework\\nthat leverages the strengths of spike cameras while mitigating biases in both\\nspatial and temporal dimensions. Our method introduces Spike-based Micro-debias\\n(SM) to capture subtle frame-to-frame variations and preserve critical details,\\neven under minimal scene or lighting changes. Additionally, Spike-based\\nGlobal-debias (SG) refines predictions by reducing inconsistencies across\\ndiverse conditions. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets\\ndemonstrate that SOTA outperforms existing methods by eliminating composite\\nnoise bias. Our code and dataset will be released at\\nhttps://github.com/lwxfight/sota.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T08:30:40Z\"}"}
