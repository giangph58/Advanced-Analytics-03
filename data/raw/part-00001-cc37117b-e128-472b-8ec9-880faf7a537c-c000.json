Specifically, we establish a scale-critical semi-global\\nexistence theorem from past null infinity and show that the focusing of\\ngravitational waves, the concentration of electromagnetic fields, or the\\ncondensation of complex scalar fields, each individually, can lead to the\\nformation of a trapped surface. In addition, we capture a nontrivial charging\\nprocess along past null infinity, which introduces new difficulties due to the\\nabnormal behavior of the matter fields. Nevertheless, the semi-global existence\\nresult and the formation of a trapped surface remain valid.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,gr-qc,math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:49:11Z\"}"}
