{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21426v1\", \"title\": \"Topotactical hydrogen induced single-band $d$-wave superconductivity in\\n  La$_2$NiO$_4$\", \"summary\": \"La$_2$NiO$_4$ is an antiferromagnetic insulator with a structural resemblance\\nto its cuprate counterpart, La$_2$CuO$_4$. However, La$_2$CuO$_4$ has a\\nCu$^{2+}$ or 3$d^9$ electronic configuration that needs to be hole or electron\\ndoped for superconductivity, whereas La$_2$NiO$_4$ is 3$d^8$ with divalent\\nNi$^{2+}$. Making a cuprate analog through conventional electron doping is\\nimpractical due to the rarity of trivalent substituents for La. In this work,\\nwe propose an alternative route: intercalating topotactical hydrogen which is\\npossible through electric-field-controlled protonation and transforms\\nLa$_2$NiO$_4$ into a 3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ single-band two-dimensional\\nanti-ferromagnetic Mott insulator analogous to La$_2$CuO$_4$. This we find\\nthrough density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory calculations.\\nThe furthergoing dynamical vertex approximation predicts that H-La$_2$NiO$_4$\\ncan host $d$-wave superconductivity under 15\\\\% hole doping with a critical\\ntemperature above 20\\\\,K. Our findings not only suggest a new method for tuning\\nthe electronic structure of layered nickelates but also provides theoretical\\nevidence for a new nickelate superconductor, awaiting experimental synthesis.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T08:33:43Z\"}"}
