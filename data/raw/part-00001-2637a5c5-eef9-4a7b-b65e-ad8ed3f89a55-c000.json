The first result\\nof this study is an equilibrium existence theorem in graphon games, under the\\nsame conditions as those in network games. We prove the existence of an\\nequilibrium in a graphon game with an infinite-dimensional strategy space,\\nunder the continuity and quasi-concavity of the utility functions. The second\\nresult characterizes Nash equilibria in graphon games as the limit points of\\nasymptotic Nash equilibria in large network games. If a sequence of large\\nnetwork games converges to a graphon game, any convergent sequence of\\nasymptotic Nash equilibria in these large network games also converges to a\\nNash equilibrium of the graphon game. In addition, for any graphon game and its\\nequilibrium, there exists a sequence of large network games that converges to\\nthe graphon game and has asymptotic Nash equilibria converging to the\\nequilibrium. These results suggest that the concept of a graphon game is an\\nidealized limit of large network games as the number of players tends to\\ninfinity.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.TH\", \"categories\": \"econ.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T17:51:15Z\"}"}
