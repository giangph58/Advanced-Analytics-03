While the interplay of the $d$-wave superconductor and QSHI has\\nbeen studied as a platform to realize Majorana corner modes (MCMs), we show\\nthat the addition of the spin texture enables the tunability of these MCMs.\\nEach corner of this hybrid system can host one or two Majorana modes depending\\non the system parameters, in particular, exchange strength and pitch vector of\\nthe spin texture. To characterize the higher order bulk topology, we compute\\nthe quadrupolar winding number, which directly corresponds to the number of\\nMCMs acquiring a value of one for four corner modes and two for eight corner\\nmodes. We investigate and show the close resemblance in the topological phase\\ndiagrams obtained from the low energy effective Hamiltonian that reveals an\\nemergent in-plane Zeeman field and spin-orbit coupling induced by the spin\\ntexture, and the real space tight binding lattice model. The microscopic\\npairing mechanism responsible for the appearance of SOTSC phase is investigated\\nvia an effective bulk pairing analysis, while a low-energy edge theory captures\\nthe mechanism behind tunability of MCMs. Our result paves the way for realizing\\nSOTC with multiple MCMs which can be tuned via system parameters.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:15:40Z\"}"}
