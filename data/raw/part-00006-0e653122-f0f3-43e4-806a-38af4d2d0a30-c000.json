With the aim of\\nconfirming the planetary nature of the transit signal detected by TESS and\\ndetermining the mass of the planet, we performed an intensive Doppler campaign\\nwith the HARPS spectrograph, collecting radial velocity measurements. We found\\nthat TOI-3493 b lies in a nearly circular orbit and has a mass of 9.0+/-1.2\\nM_earth and a radius of 3.22+/-0.08 R_earth, implying a bulk density of\\n1.47+/-0.23 g/cm^3, consistent with a composition comprising a small solid core\\nsurrounded by a thick H/He dominated atmosphere.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T12:20:27Z\"}"}
