{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11863v1\", \"title\": \"Understanding the evolution of the magnetic ground state in\\n  Ba$_4$NaRu$_3$O$_{12}$\", \"summary\": \"We report a comprehensive investigation of the quadruple perovskite\\nBa$_4$NaRu$_3$O$_{12}$, in which we discover a robust spin-lattice coupled\\nground state characterized by a long-range antiferromagnetic ordering at $T_N\\n\\\\sim$ 257 K. The system's unique structural motif of three symmetrically\\ndistinct magnetic ions, including Ru dimers separated by non-magnetic layers,\\nis intimately correlated with its magnetic behavior, as evidenced by\\ntemperature-dependent diffraction measurements and specific heat data. The\\npowder neutron diffraction patterns at 13 K showed that the spins within the\\ndimers are antiparallel, leading to a net zero moment contribution and a\\nstaggered arrangement of the triangular layers formed by the Ru moments within\\nthe corner-shared octahedra along the $c$-axis. The low-temperature specific\\nheat revealed an extra boson peak contribution from optical modes with a\\nmaximum vibrational energy of $\\\\sim$55cm$^{-1}$. The charge transport exhibited\\nvariable-range hopping (VRH) behaviour below $T_N$, with a stronger\\nenergy-dependence than expected from the Efros-Shklovskii model, suggesting the\\npresence of multiparticle correlation effects.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T08:37:28Z\"}"}
