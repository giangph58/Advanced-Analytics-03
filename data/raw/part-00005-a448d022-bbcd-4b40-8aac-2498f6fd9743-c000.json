The\\norientation-dependent harmonic spectra show obvious enhancement harmonics. We\\nalso focus on the ellipticity of these enhanced harmonics. Utilizing the\\nrecombination trajectory model, the enhanced harmonics are attributed to the\\ncaustic effect, whose orientation dependence originates from the inequivalence\\nof $\\\\textrm{K}$ points during the electron ionization process for different\\norientation angles. In addition, the harmonic ellipticity can be well\\nunderstood by the phase difference of saddle-point currents. Based on our\\ntheory, we design a two-color field scheme to generate elliptically polarized\\nattosecond pulses in gapped graphene. This work may shed light on the\\ngeneration of elliptically polarized attosecond pulses in two-dimensional\\nmaterials.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T07:52:56Z\"}"}
