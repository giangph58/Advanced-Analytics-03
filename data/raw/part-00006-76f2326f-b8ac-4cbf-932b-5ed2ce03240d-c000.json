The output\\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and Cram\\\\'er Rao bounds (CRBs)\\non time delay and Doppler shift are used as figures of merit to accomplish\\nreliable detection as well as accurate measurements. The transmitted code is\\nsubject to radar power budget requirements and a similarity constraint. To\\ntackle the resulting non-convex multi-objective optimization problem, a\\npolynomial-time algorithm that integrates scalarization and tensor-based\\nrelaxation methods is developed. The corresponding relaxed multi-linear\\nproblems are solved by means of the maximum block improvement (MBI) framework,\\nwhere the optimal solution at each iteration is obtained in closed form.\\nNumeral results demonstrate the trade-off between the detection and the\\nestimation performance, along with the acceptable Doppler robustness achieved\\nby the proposed algorithm.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP,H.4.0\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T06:30:11Z\"}"}
