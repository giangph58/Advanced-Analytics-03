{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05287v1\", \"title\": \"Morphologically Symmetric Reinforcement Learning for Ambidextrous\\n  Bimanual Manipulation\", \"summary\": \"Humans naturally exhibit bilateral symmetry in their gross manipulation\\nskills, effortlessly mirroring simple actions between left and right hands.\\nBimanual robots-which also feature bilateral symmetry-should similarly exploit\\nthis property to perform tasks with either hand. Unlike humans, who often favor\\na dominant hand for fine dexterous skills, robots should ideally execute\\nambidextrous manipulation with equal proficiency. To this end, we introduce\\nSYMDEX (SYMmetric DEXterity), a reinforcement learning framework for\\nambidextrous bi-manipulation that leverages the robot's inherent bilateral\\nsymmetry as an inductive bias. SYMDEX decomposes complex bimanual manipulation\\ntasks into per-hand subtasks and trains dedicated policies for each. By\\nexploiting bilateral symmetry via equivariant neural networks, experience from\\none arm is inherently leveraged by the opposite arm. We then distill the\\nsubtask policies into a global ambidextrous policy that is independent of the\\nhand-task assignment. We evaluate SYMDEX on six challenging simulated\\nmanipulation tasks and demonstrate successful real-world deployment on two of\\nthem. Our approach strongly outperforms baselines on complex task in which the\\nleft and right hands perform different roles. We further demonstrate SYMDEX's\\nscalability by extending it to a four-arm manipulation setup, where our\\nsymmetry-aware policies enable effective multi-arm collaboration and\\ncoordination. Our results highlight how structural symmetry as inductive bias\\nin policy learning enhances sample efficiency, robustness, and generalization\\nacross diverse dexterous manipulation tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:29:00Z\"}"}
