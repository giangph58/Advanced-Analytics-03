Notably, under such anisotropic\\nconditions, the nonequilibrium dynamics can lead to the occupation of molecular\\nexcited states. We consider cases of quenching from attractive to repulsive\\ninteraction and vice versa, analyzing the impact of the pre- and postquench\\nstates. The analysis of overlap integrals for the both states reveals a\\nsignificant contribution from the molecular excited state. Moreover, the\\noverlap with the prequench states might serve as an indicator of when this\\nexcited state may emerge. Additionally, we calculate the energy spectrum for\\nthe lowest levels in the both isotropic and anisotropic harmonic traps.\\nThroughout our study, we use a Gaussian-shaped finite-range interaction\\npotential.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph,physics.atm-clus,physics.comp-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T16:06:39Z\"}"}
