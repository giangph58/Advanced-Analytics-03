{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10224v1\", \"title\": \"Simulation and Experimental Validation of Optical Camera Communication\", \"summary\": \"While simulation tools for visible light communication (VLC) with photo\\ndetectors (PDs) have been widely investigated, similar tools for optical camera\\ncommunication (OCC) with complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensors\\nare lacking in this regard. Camera based VLC systems have much lower data rates\\nowing to camera exposure times. Among the few extant OCC simulation tools, none\\nallow for simulation of images when exposure time is greater than the signal\\nperiod. An accurate simulation of the OCC system can be used to improve the\\ndata rate and quality of performance. We propose a simple simulation technique\\nfor OCC which allows to test for system performance at frequencies beyond the\\ncamera shutter speed. This will allow much needed data rate improvement by\\noperating at the actual frequency a decoding algorithm ceases detection instead\\nof the exposure limit used now. We have tested the accuracy of simulation by\\ncomparing the detection success rates of simulated images with experimental\\nimages. The proposed simulation technique was shown to be accurate through\\nexperimental validation for two different cameras.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T13:45:09Z\"}"}
