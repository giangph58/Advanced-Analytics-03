In the literature, three main classes\\nof gene network models can be distinguished: (i) non-quantitative (or\\ndata-based) models which do not describe the probability distribution of gene\\nexpressions; (ii) quantitative models which fully describe the probability\\ndistribution of all genes coexpression; and (iii) mechanistic models which\\nallow for a causal interpretation of gene interactions. We propose two rigorous\\nframeworks to model gene alteration in a dynamical GRN, depending on whether\\nthe network model is quantitative or mechanistic. We explain how these models\\ncan be used for design of experiment, or, if additional alteration data are\\navailable, for validation purposes or to improve the parameter estimation of\\nthe original model. We apply these methods to the Gaussian graphical model,\\nwhich is quantitative but non-mechanistic, and to mechanistic models of\\nBayesian networks and penalized linear regression.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.MN\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.MN,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T09:17:22Z\"}"}
