{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20580v1\", \"title\": \"Sense-then-Charge: Wireless Power Transfer to Unresponsive Devices with\\n  Unknown Location\", \"summary\": \"This paper explores a multi-antenna dual-functional radio frequency (RF)\\nwireless power transfer (WPT) and radar system to charge multiple unresponsive\\ndevices. We formulate a beamforming problem to maximize the minimum received\\npower at the devices without prior location and channel state information (CSI)\\nknowledge. We propose dividing transmission blocks into sensing and charging\\nphases. First, the location of the devices is estimated by sending sensing\\nsignals and performing multiple signal classification and least square\\nestimation on the received echo. Then, the estimations are used for CSI\\nprediction and RF-WPT beamforming. Simulation results reveal that there is an\\noptimal number of blocks allocated for sensing and charging depending on the\\nsystem setup. Our sense-then-charge (STC) protocol can outperform CSI-free\\nbenchmarks and achieve near-optimal performance with a sufficient number of\\nreceive antennas and transmit power. However, STC struggles if using\\ninsufficient antennas or power as device numbers grow.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T09:36:24Z\"}"}
