{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20556v1\", \"title\": \"Mutual Information Minimization for Side-Channel Attack Resistance via\\n  Optimal Noise Injection\", \"summary\": \"Side-channel attacks (SCAs) pose a serious threat to system security by\\nextracting secret keys through physical leakages such as power consumption,\\ntiming variations, and electromagnetic emissions. Among existing\\ncountermeasures, artificial noise injection is recognized as one of the most\\neffective techniques. However, its high power consumption poses a major\\nchallenge for resource-constrained systems such as Internet of Things (IoT)\\ndevices, motivating the development of more efficient protection schemes. In\\nthis paper, we model SCAs as a communication channel and aim to suppress\\ninformation leakage by minimizing the mutual information between the secret\\ninformation and side-channel observations, subject to a power constraint on the\\nartificial noise. We propose an optimal artificial noise injection method to\\nminimize the mutual information in systems with Gaussian inputs. Specifically,\\nwe formulate two convex optimization problems: 1) minimizing the total mutual\\ninformation, and 2) minimizing the maximum mutual information across\\nobservations. Numerical results show that the proposed methods significantly\\nreduce both total and maximum mutual information compared to conventional\\ntechniques, confirming their effectiveness for resource-constrained,\\nsecurity-critical systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T08:57:21Z\"}"}
