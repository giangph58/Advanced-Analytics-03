Labelings are determined by regularizing initial local labelings\\nthrough the dynamic interaction of both labels and label assignments across the\\ngraph, entirely encoded by a dictionary of competing labeled patches and\\nmediated by patch assignment variables. Maximal consistency of patch\\nassignments is achieved by geometric numerical integration of a Riemannian\\nascent flow, as critical point of a Lagrangian action functional. Experiments\\nillustrate properties of the approach, including uncertainty quantification of\\nlabel assignments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T15:34:58Z\"}"}
