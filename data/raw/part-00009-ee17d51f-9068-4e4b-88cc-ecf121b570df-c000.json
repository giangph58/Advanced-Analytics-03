We consider a setting where $m$\\nchores are allocated to $n$ agents and the disutility of each chore for each\\nagent is drawn from a probability distribution. We show that an envy-free\\nallocation exists with high probability provided that $m \\\\ge 2n$, and moreover,\\n$m$ must be at least $n+\\\\Theta(n)$ in order for the existence to hold. On the\\nother hand, we prove that a proportional allocation is likely to exist as long\\nas $m = \\\\omega(1)$, and this threshold is asymptotically tight. Our results\\nreveal a clear contrast with the allocation of goods, where a larger number of\\nitems is necessary to ensure existence for both notions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GT\", \"categories\": \"cs.GT,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T12:35:35Z\"}"}
