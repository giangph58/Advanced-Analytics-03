{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17749v1\", \"title\": \"MSGCN: Multiplex Spatial Graph Convolution Network for Interlayer Link\\n  Weight Prediction\", \"summary\": \"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for various learning\\ntasks, ranging from node classification to link prediction. They have\\ndemonstrated excellent performance in multiple domains involving\\ngraph-structured data. However, an important category of learning tasks, namely\\nlink weight prediction, has received less emphasis due to its increased\\ncomplexity compared to binary link classification. Link weight prediction\\nbecomes even more challenging when considering multilayer networks, where nodes\\ncan be interconnected across multiple layers. To address these challenges, we\\npropose a new method named Multiplex Spatial Graph Convolution Network (MSGCN),\\nwhich spatially embeds information across multiple layers to predict interlayer\\nlink weights. The MSGCN model generalizes spatial graph convolution to\\nmultiplex networks and captures the geometric structure of nodes across\\nmultiple layers. Extensive experiments using data with known interlayer link\\ninformation show that the MSGCN model has robust, accurate, and generalizable\\nlink weight prediction performance across a wide variety of multiplex network\\nstructures.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T17:08:16Z\"}"}
