{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04403v1\", \"title\": \"Blockchain Data Analytics: A Scoping Literature Review and Directions\\n  for Future Research\", \"summary\": \"Blockchain technology has rapidly expanded beyond its original use in\\ncryptocurrencies to a broad range of applications, creating vast amounts of\\nimmutable, decentralized data. As blockchain adoption grows, so does the need\\nfor advanced data analytics techniques to extract insights for business\\nintelligence, fraud detection, financial analysis and many more. While previous\\nresearch has examined specific aspects of blockchain data analytics, such as\\ntransaction patterns, illegal activity detection, and data management, there\\nremains a lack of comprehensive reviews that explore the full scope of\\nblockchain data analytics. This study addresses this gap through a scoping\\nliterature review, systematically mapping the existing research landscape,\\nidentifying key topics, and highlighting emerging trends. Using established\\nmethodologies for literature reviews, we analyze 466 publications, clustering\\nthem into six major research themes: illegal activity detection, data\\nmanagement, financial analysis, user analysis, community detection, and mining\\nanalysis. Our findings reveal a strong focus on detecting illicit activities\\nand financial applications, while holistic business intelligence use cases\\nremain underexplored. This review provides a structured overview of blockchain\\ndata analytics, identifying research gaps and proposing future directions to\\nenhance the fields impact.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.ET\", \"categories\": \"cs.ET\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T13:36:43Z\"}"}
