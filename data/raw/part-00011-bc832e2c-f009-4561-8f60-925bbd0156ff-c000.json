Departing from methods\\nthat require consistent localization and mapping, we formalize the obstacle\\navoidance problem as a composite control barrier function constructed only from\\nthe online onboard range measurements. The proposed framework acts as a safety\\nfilter, modifying the acceleration references derived by the nominal\\nposition/velocity control loops, and is integrated into the PX4 autopilot\\nstack. Experimental studies using a small multirotor aerial robot demonstrate\\nthe effectiveness and performance of the solution within dynamic maneuvering\\nand unknown environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T12:45:11Z\"}"}
