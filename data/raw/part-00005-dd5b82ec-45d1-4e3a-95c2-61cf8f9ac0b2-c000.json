The absence of both time-reversal\\nand inversion symmetries allows for new types of responses. We systematically\\ncalculate the transverse, longitudinal, and Hall responses to axial gauge\\npotentials with both linear and quadratic dispersion relations. The transverse\\nand Hall responses are of comparable magnitude, while the longitudinal response\\nis much smaller. Notably, with increasing frequency, the transverse and Hall\\nresponse functions manifest a peak whose height is determined by the properties\\nof Weyl fermions and is independent of the axial gauge potential. The main\\nfeatures of the response functions survive in the presence of disorders. As\\napplications of our results, we propose a Hall type magnetopiezoelectric\\neffect, where a transverse sound wave can induce an electric current whose\\ndirection is perpendicular to the directions of sound propagation and\\npolarization. Our results also provide a mechanism to excite magnons using\\nelectric fields and could be useful for magnon spintronics.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:36:52Z\"}"}
