For any weighted oriented graph $D$, if its toric\\nideal $I_D$ is generalized robust or weakly robust, then we show that $D$ has\\nno subgraphs of certain structures.\\n  We prove the equality of Graver basis, Universal Gr\\\\\\\"obner basis, reduced\\nGr\\\\\\\"obner basis with respect to degree lexicographic order of the toric ideals\\n$I_D$ of weighted oriented graphs $D=\\\\C_1\\\\cup_P \\\\cdots \\\\cup_P \\\\C_n$ consist of\\ncycles $\\\\C_1\\\\ldots,\\\\C_n$ that share a path $P$. As a consequence, we show that\\n(i) $I_{D}$ is robust iff $I_{D}$ is strongly robust; (ii) $I_{D}$ is\\ngeneralized robust iff $I_{D}$ is weakly robust. If at most two of the cycles\\n$\\\\C_i$ in $D$ are unbalanced, then the following statements are equivalent: (i)\\n$I_{D}$ is strongly robust; (ii) $I_{D}$ is robust; (iii) $I_{D}$ is\\ngeneralized robust; (iv) $I_{D}$ is weakly robust; (v) $D$ has no subgraphs of\\ntypes $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$, where $D_1$ is a weighted oriented graph consisting\\nof two balanced cycles share an edge in $D$, and $D_2$ is a weighted oriented\\ngraph consisting of three cycles that share an edge\\\\ such that one cycle is\\nbalanced and the rest two are unbalanced cycles, as in figure \\\\ref{fig2}. We\\nexplicitly determine the Graver basis of the toric ideal of two balanced cycles\\nsharing a path.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AC\", \"categories\": \"math.AC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T16:17:05Z\"}"}
