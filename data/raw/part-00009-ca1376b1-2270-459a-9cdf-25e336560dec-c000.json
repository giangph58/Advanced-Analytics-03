{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04381v1\", \"title\": \"Screening of the band gap in electrically biased bilayer graphene: From\\n  Hartree to Hartree-Fock\", \"summary\": \"It is well known that a direct band gap may be opened in bilayer graphene via\\nthe application of a perpendicular electric field (bias). The bias and the\\nchemical potential are controlled by electrostatic gating where the top and\\nbottom gate voltages are tuned separately. The value of the band gap opened by\\nthe bias field is influenced by the self screening of the bilayer graphene. The\\nHartree contribution to the self screening is well known in literature, with\\nHartree screening significantly renormalizing the gap. In the present work we\\nderive the Fock contribution to the self screening and demonstrate that it is\\nequally important and in the low density regime even more important than the\\nHartree contribution. We calculate the Hartree-Fock screened band gap as a\\nfunction of electron doping at zero temperature and also as a function of\\ntemperature at zero doping.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T13:04:05Z\"}"}
