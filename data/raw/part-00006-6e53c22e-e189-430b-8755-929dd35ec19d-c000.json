{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05402v1\", \"title\": \"CART-ELC: Oblique Decision Tree Induction via Exhaustive Search\", \"summary\": \"Oblique decision trees have attracted attention due to their potential for\\nimproved classification performance over traditional axis-aligned decision\\ntrees. However, methods that rely on exhaustive search to find oblique splits\\nface computational challenges. As a result, they have not been widely explored.\\nWe introduce a novel algorithm, Classification and Regression Tree - Exhaustive\\nLinear Combinations (CART-ELC), for inducing oblique decision trees that\\nperforms an exhaustive search on a restricted set of hyperplanes. We then\\ninvestigate the algorithm's computational complexity and its predictive\\ncapabilities. Our results demonstrate that CART-ELC consistently achieves\\ncompetitive performance on small datasets, often yielding statistically\\nsignificant improvements in classification accuracy relative to existing\\ndecision tree induction algorithms, while frequently producing shallower,\\nsimpler, and thus more interpretable trees.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T16:42:13Z\"}"}
