{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17713v1\", \"title\": \"Target-Date Funds: A State-of-the-Art Review with Policy Applications to\\n  Chile's Pension Reform\", \"summary\": \"This review paper explores the evolution and implementation of target-date\\nfunds (TDFs), specifically focusing on their application within the context of\\nChile's 2025 pension reform. The introduction of TDFs marks a significant shift\\nin Chile's pension system, which has traditionally relied on a multifund\\nstructure (essentially a target-risk funds system). We offer a comprehensive\\nreview of the theoretical foundations and practical considerations of TDFs,\\nhighlighting key challenges and opportunities for Chilean regulators and fund\\nmanagers. Notably, we recommend that the glide path design should be dynamic,\\nincorporating adjustments based on total accumulated wealth, with particular\\nflexibility depending on each investor's risk tolerance. Furthermore, we\\npropose that the new benchmark for generational funds should feature a wide\\ndeviation band relative to the new benchmark portfolio, which could foster a\\nmarket with more investment strategies and better competition among fund\\nmanagers, encourage the inclusion of alternative assets, and foster greater\\ndiversification. Lastly, we highlight the need for future work to define a\\nglide path model that incorporates the theoretical frameworks described,\\ntailored to the unique parameters of the Chilean pension system. These\\nrecommendations aim to optimize the long-term retirement outcomes for Chilean\\nworkers under the new pension structure.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.PM\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.PM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T16:16:54Z\"}"}
