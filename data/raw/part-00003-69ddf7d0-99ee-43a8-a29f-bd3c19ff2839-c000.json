{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03302v1\", \"title\": \"Exploring the application of quantum technologies to industrial and\\n  real-world use cases\", \"summary\": \"Recent advancements in quantum computing are leading to an era of practical\\nutility, enabling the tackling of increasingly complex problems. The goal of\\nthis era is to leverage quantum computing to solve real-world problems in\\nfields such as machine learning, optimization, and material simulation, using\\nrevolutionary quantum methods and machines. All this progress has been achieved\\neven while being immersed in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era,\\ncharacterized by the current devices' inability to process medium-scale complex\\nproblems efficiently. Consequently, there has been a surge of interest in\\nquantum algorithms in various fields. Multiple factors have played a role in\\nthis extraordinary development, with three being particularly noteworthy: (i)\\nthe development of larger devices with enhanced interconnections between their\\nconstituent qubits, (ii) the development of specialized frameworks, and (iii)\\nthe existence of well-known or ready-to-use hybrid schemes that simplify the\\nmethod development process. In this context, this manuscript presents and\\noverviews some recent contributions within this paradigm, showcasing the\\npotential of quantum computing to emerge as a significant research catalyst in\\nthe fields of machine learning and optimization in the coming years.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.ET\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:33:23Z\"}"}
