However, we found in experiments that\\nCLIP's logits suffer from serious inter-class confusion problems in downstream\\ntasks, and the ambiguity between categories seriously affects the accuracy. To\\naddress this challenge, we propose a novel method called Logits DeConfusion,\\nwhich effectively learns and eliminates inter-class confusion in logits by\\ncombining our Multi-level Adapter Fusion (MAF) module with our Inter-Class\\nDeconfusion (ICD) module. Our MAF extracts features from different levels and\\nfuses them uniformly to enhance feature representation. Our ICD learnably\\neliminates inter-class confusion in logits with a residual structure.\\nExperimental results show that our method can significantly improve the\\nclassification performance and alleviate the inter-class confusion problem.
