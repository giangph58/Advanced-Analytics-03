This effect is present in the experimental recordings of\\nsingle-channel currents, but not only. The sequences of dwell times of\\nfunctionally different channel states also exhibit long-range correlations. We\\nhave found that the memory effect within the dwell-time series is related to\\nthe coupling between the channel's activation gate (AG) and selectivity filter\\n(SF), which controls the ion conduction. In this work, we analyzed both the\\nexperimental data describing the activity of potassium channels of different\\ntypes (e.g., BK, mitoBK, mitoTASK-3, mitoKv1.3, TREK-2-like channels) and the\\nseries generated according to our previously proposed Hurst effect model. The\\nobtained results suggest that the strength of the allosteric cooperation\\nbetween the AG and SF determines not only the conductance of the channel -\\nwhich governs how often ions in SF move or remain blocked - but also modulates\\nthe correlations present in the dwell times when sampled with a suitably high\\nsampling rate. Moreover, we found that rectification can interfere with this\\nprocess, contributing to additional changes in correlations within the\\nchannel's sojourns in subsequent states. Similarly, the correlations may be\\naffected by processes proceeding at longer time scales, like interactions with\\nthe channel's auxiliary domains or lipid surroundings.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.CD\", \"categories\": \"nlin.CD\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T09:41:03Z\"}"}
