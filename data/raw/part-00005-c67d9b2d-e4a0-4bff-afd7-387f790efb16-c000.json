{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14869v1\", \"title\": \"X-ray Polarization of the BL Lac Type Blazar H 1426+428\", \"summary\": \"We report the X-ray polarization properties of the high-synchrotron-peaked BL\\nLac H 1426+428, based on two-epoch observational data from the Imaging X-ray\\nPolarimetry Explorer (IXPE). For the first observation, only an upper limit of\\npolarization degree ($\\\\Pi_{\\\\rm X}$), $\\\\Pi_{\\\\rm X}<19.5\\\\%$, at the 99\\\\%\\nconfidence level (C.L.) is determined. In contrast, for the second observation,\\nwe derive $\\\\Pi_{\\\\rm X}=20.6\\\\%\\\\pm2.9\\\\%$ with a polarization angle ($\\\\psi_{\\\\rm\\nX}$) of $\\\\psi_{\\\\rm X}=116.1^{\\\\circ}\\\\pm4.1^{\\\\circ}$ at a C.L. of 7.1 $\\\\sigma$.\\nThe time-resolved and energy-resolved polarization analysis reveals no\\nsignificant variation in $\\\\psi_{\\\\rm X}$ and no detectable polarization within\\nnarrower energy bins for the first observation, while the polarization during\\nthe second observation is predominantly dominated by low-energy photons.\\nFurthermore, the X-rays during the second observation are found to be in a\\nhigher flux state with a harder spectrum compared to that observed during the\\nfirst observation, consistent with a {\\\\it harder-when-brighter} behavior. We\\npropose that the plasma responsible for the X-ray emission during the first\\nobservation propagates downstream and encounters a shock, leading to electron\\nacceleration and more ordered of the magnetic fields. The enhanced X-ray\\nemission observed during the second observation is produced by\\nshock-accelerated electrons within an ordered magnetic field region via\\nsynchrotron radiation. No significant detection of polarization during the\\nfirst IXPE observation may be due to the limited number of detected photons.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T05:38:20Z\"}"}
