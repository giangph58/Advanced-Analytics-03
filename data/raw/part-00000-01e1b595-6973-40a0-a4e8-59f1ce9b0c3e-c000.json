{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04925v1\", \"title\": \"Scaling regimes in slow quenches within a gapped phase\", \"summary\": \"We consider the finite-time quench dynamics in the quantum transverse field\\nIsing model which exhibits a second order phase transition from a paramagnetic\\nto a ferromagnetic phase, as the transverse magnetic field is decreased. These\\ndynamics have been thoroughly investigated in previous studies when the\\ncritical point is crossed during the quench; here, we quench the system from\\ndeep in the paramagnetic phase to just above the critical field so that the\\nsystem remains in the gapped phase throughout the quench duration. On linearly\\nquenching the infinitely large system, we find that the behavior of mean\\nlongitudinal defect density and mean transverse magnetization at the end of the\\nquench falls into three distinct scaling regimes as the quench time is\\nincreased. For sufficiently small quench times, these observables remain\\nroughly constant, but for larger quench times, a crossover occurs from the\\nKibble-Zurek scaling law to the quadratic quench rate law when the Kibble-Zurek\\ntime is of the order of relaxation time at the final quench field. These\\nresults are shown analytically using power series and uniform asymptotic\\nexpansions of the exact solution of the model, and also compared with an\\nadiabatic perturbation theory in the third regime. We find that the above\\nmentioned scaling regimes hold for quenches within the ferromagnetic phase\\nalso, and provide a general scaling argument for crossover from the\\nKibble-Zurek regime to an adiabatic regime for slow quenches within a gapped\\nphase.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:05:46Z\"}"}
