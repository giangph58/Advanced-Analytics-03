As time elapses cosmic structures grow in mass\\nand size via mergers and through the continuous accretion of material onto the\\npotential wells of dark matter haloes. In particular, some\\ndynamically-perturbed galaxy clusters exhibit spectacular non-thermal radio\\nfeatures known as radio relics that are believed to trace cluster merger shocks\\nat different stages of evolution. These radio shocks are thought to be\\nilluminated by the acceleration of cosmic ray electrons in the presence of\\nintracluster magnetic fields. In this contribution, we analyse a large sample\\nof hydrodynamical, cosmological re-simulations of merging galaxy clusters\\nbelonging to The Three Hundred Project to study the median evolution of radio\\nrelics as a function of cluster mass and redshift. This synthetic cluster\\nmerger sample enables us to compute in detail the luminosity output of radio\\nshocks from their onset at core passage to demise.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T13:25:25Z\"}"}
