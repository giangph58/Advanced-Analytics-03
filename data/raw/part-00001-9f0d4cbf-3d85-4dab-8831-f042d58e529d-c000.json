The taxonomic statistics are\\nsimilarly skewed; in total, 13 asteroids larger than 100 km are known to have\\nsatellites, but none have been discovered among S-type asteroids. Previous\\nmodeling suggests that satellites could be generated by impacts, but spin and\\nshape have never been tracked in models to relate collisional circumstances\\nwith those two observed properties concerning the primary. Here we show, by\\ncombining simulations of impacts into porous low-density asteroids, their\\nsubsequent disruption, reaccumulation and long-term satellite stability, a\\ndirect pathway for the formation of satellites. The immediate distortion and\\nelongation of a rotating target body provides a launching point for some debris\\ndistinct from simple ballistic ejecta trajectories. The debris that are found\\nto originate from the distorted long-axis is sourced primarily from 10-20 km\\nbelow the surface and can be placed directly onto eccentric orbits with\\nsufficiently large pericenter distances that avoid rapid re-impact. The\\nspecific energy and resultant total mass loss in satellite-forming collisions\\nare not constraining, which explains the observed lack of correlation between\\nasteroids with satellites and those that are part of large asteroid families.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:53:35Z\"}"}
