{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04256v1\", \"title\": \"Realizing high-temperature superconductivity in compressed\\n  molecular-hydrogen through Li doping\", \"summary\": \"In this study, we explore lithium-doped stable molecular hydrogen structures\\nby performing first-principles crystal structure searches across varying\\ncompositions in the Li-H system under high pressure. Our search reveals a cubic\\nphase of LiH12, which shows promise as a high-temperature superconductor. Our\\nBader charge analysis suggests that electron transfer from Li to H atoms tunes\\nthe intra- and inter-molecular H-H distances, which are critical for the\\nmetallization of molecular hydrogen. This modulation alters the interaction\\nbetween bonding and anti-bonding 1s states of hydrogen molecules. Furthermore,\\nLi ions serve as stabilizers for the distorted H2 molecular network through\\nionic interactions. Numerical solutions to the fully anisotropic\\nMigdal-Eliashberg equations reveals that this phase could exhibit\\nsuperconductivity above 300 K at a pressure of 250 GPa, a pressure value that\\nis typically achievable using a diamond anvil cell. Detailed analysis of\\nspecies-specific phonons and the Eliashberg function shows that low- and\\nintermediate-energy phonons are crucial in promoting strong electron-phonon\\ncoupling. Thus, our study establishes lithium doping as a promising approach to\\ninduce high-temperature superconductivity in compressed molecular hydrogen\\nwithout causing molecular dissociation.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T09:00:38Z\"}"}
