{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20460v1\", \"title\": \"Sequence Reconstruction under Channels with Multiple Bursts of\\n  Insertions or Deletions\", \"summary\": \"The sequence reconstruction problem involves a model where a sequence is\\ntransmitted over several identical channels. This model investigates the\\nminimum number of channels required for the unique reconstruction of the\\ntransmitted sequence. Levenshtein established that this number exceeds the\\nmaximum size of the intersection between the error balls of any two distinct\\ntransmitted sequences by one. In this paper, we consider channels subject to\\nmultiple bursts of insertions and multiple bursts of deletions, respectively,\\nwhere each burst has an exact length of value b. We provide a complete solution\\nfor the insertion case while partially addressing the deletion case.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T06:47:12Z\"}"}
