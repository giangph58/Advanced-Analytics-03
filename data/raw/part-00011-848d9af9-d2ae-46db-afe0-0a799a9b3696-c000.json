We introduce SITE, a\\nbenchmark dataset towards SI Thorough Evaluation in a standardized format of\\nmulti-choice visual question-answering, designed to assess large\\nvision-language models' spatial intelligence across diverse visual modalities\\n(single-image, multi-image, and video) and SI factors (figural to environmental\\nscales, spatial visualization and orientation, intrinsic and extrinsic, static\\nand dynamic). Our approach to curating the benchmark combines a bottom-up\\nsurvey about 31 existing datasets and a top-down strategy drawing upon three\\nclassification systems in cognitive science, which prompt us to design two\\nnovel types of tasks about view-taking and dynamic scenes. Extensive\\nexperiments reveal that leading models fall behind human experts especially in\\nspatial orientation, a fundamental SI factor. Moreover, we demonstrate a\\npositive correlation between a model's spatial reasoning proficiency and its\\nperformance on an embodied AI task.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T17:45:44Z\"}"}
