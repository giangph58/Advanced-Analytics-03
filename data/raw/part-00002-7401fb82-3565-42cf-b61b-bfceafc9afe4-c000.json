We introduce a general, data-driven approach that employs Shannon\\nentropy as a transferable metric to quantify the maximum information\\nextractable from noisy data via their clustering into statistically-relevant\\nmicro-domains. We demonstrate the method's efficiency by analyzing, as a\\nrepresentative example, time-series data extracted from molecular dynamics\\nsimulations of water and ice coexisting at the solid/liquid transition\\ntemperature. The method allows quantifying the information contained in the\\ndata distributions (time-independent component) and the additional information\\ngain attainable by analyzing data as time-series (i.e., accounting for the\\ninformation contained in data time-correlations). The approach is also highly\\neffective for high-dimensional datasets, providing clear demonstrations of how\\nconsidering components/data that may be little informative but noisy may be not\\nonly useless but even detrimental to maximum information extraction. This\\nprovides a general and robust parameter-free approach and quantitative metrics\\nfor data-analysis, and for the study of any type of system from its data.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.data-an\", \"categories\": \"physics.data-an\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T14:54:46Z\"}"}
