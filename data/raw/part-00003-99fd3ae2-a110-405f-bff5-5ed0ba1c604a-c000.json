A\\nlong-standing puzzle of too large a ratio of the elliptical-to-triangular\\n($v_{2}$-to-$v_{3}$) anisotropies in ultracentral Pb+Pb collisions at the Large\\nHadron Collider(LHC) cannot be solved simply by hydrodynamic simulations with\\ninitial conditions containing the spherical or certain deformed shape of Pb. In\\nthis Letter, using the iEBE-VISUNU relativistic viscous hydrodynamic hybrid\\nmodel simulations with the Trento initial condition, we show that a dynamic\\noctupole deformation--a shape-breathing of $^{208}$Pb --could potentially solve\\nthe $v_{2}$-to-$v_{3}$ puzzle and simultaneously describe the $v_3\\\\{4\\\\}$ data\\nmeasured in experiment. Our results strongly suggest an \\\"observation\\\" of the\\nbreathing mode of Pb and the capability of capturing transient collective\\nproperties of nuclei on yoctosecond ($10^{-24}$~s) timescales, unfeasible with\\nlow-energy nuclear reactions.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T10:01:23Z\"}"}
