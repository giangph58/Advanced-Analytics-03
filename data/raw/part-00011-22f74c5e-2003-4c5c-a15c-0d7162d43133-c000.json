We prove general inequalities relating these ''Minkowski\\nchirality'' measures to Banach--Mazur distances and to each other, and prove\\ntheir continuity with respect to the Hausdorff distance. In the planar case, we\\ndetermine the reflection axes at which the Minkowski chirality of triangles and\\nparallelograms is attained, and show that $\\\\sqrt{2}$ is a tight upper bound on\\nthe chirality in both cases.\", \"main_category\": \"math.MG\", \"categories\": \"math.MG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T15:19:06Z\"}"}
