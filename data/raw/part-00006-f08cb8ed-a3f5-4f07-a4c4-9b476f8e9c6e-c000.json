To address this, we introduce two\\nmethods for monitoring control flows: using specification-derived Petri nets\\nand using behavior-derived state transitions. We validated our method across\\nfour designs: convolutional layer operation, Gaussian blur, AES encryption, and\\na router in Network-on-Chip. Our fault injection campaign targeting the control\\nregisters and primary control inputs demonstrated high error detection rates in\\nboth datapath and control logic. Synthesis results show that a maximum\\ndetection rate is achieved with a few to around 10% area overhead in most\\ncases. The proposed detectors quickly detect 48% to 100% of failures resulting\\nfrom upsets in internal control registers and perturbations in primary control\\ninputs. The two proposed methods were compared in terms of area overhead and\\nerror detection rate. By selectively applying these two methods, a wide range\\nof area constraints can be accommodated, enabling practical implementation and\\neffectively enhancing error detection capabilities.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AR\", \"categories\": \"cs.AR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T03:51:02Z\"}"}
