A bent\\nfunction in m variables is said to be normal if it is constant on an affine\\nspace of dimension m/2. In this paper, we demonstrate that all bent functions\\nin m = 8 variables -- whose exact count, determined by Langevin and Leander\\n(Des. Codes Cryptogr. 59(1--3): 193--205, 2011), is approximately $2^106$ share\\na common algebraic property: every 8-variable bent function is normal, up to\\nthe addition of a linear function. With this result, we complete the analysis\\nof the normality of bent functions for the last unresolvedcase, m= 8. It is\\nalready known that all bent functions in m variables are normal for m <= 6,\\nwhile for m > = 10, there exist bent functions that cannot be made normal by\\nadding linear functions. Consequently, we provide a complete solution to an\\nopen problem by Charpin (J.
