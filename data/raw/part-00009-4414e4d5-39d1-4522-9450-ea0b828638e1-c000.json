Evaluating GNT automatically is particularly challenging, with\\ncurrent solutions being limited to monolingual classifiers. Such solutions are\\nnot ideal because they do not factor in the source sentence and require\\ndedicated data and fine-tuning to scale to new languages. In this work, we\\naddress such limitations by investigating the use of large language models\\n(LLMs) as evaluators of GNT. Specifically, we explore two prompting approaches:\\none in which LLMs generate sentence-level assessments only, and another, akin\\nto a chain-of-thought approach, where they first produce detailed phrase-level\\nannotations before a sentence-level judgment. Through extensive experiments on\\nmultiple languages with five models, both open and proprietary, we show that\\nLLMs can serve as evaluators of GNT. Moreover, we find that prompting for\\nphrase-level annotations before sentence-level assessments consistently\\nimproves the accuracy of all models, providing a better and more scalable\\nalternative to current solutions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T10:14:27Z\"}"}
