{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04991v1\", \"title\": \"Wavelet Policy: Imitation Policy Learning in Frequency Domain with\\n  Wavelet Transforms\", \"summary\": \"Recent imitation learning policies, often framed as time series prediction\\ntasks, directly map robotic observations-such as high-dimensional visual data\\nand proprioception-into the action space. While time series prediction\\nprimarily relies on spatial domain modeling, the underutilization of frequency\\ndomain analysis in robotic manipulation trajectory prediction may lead to\\nneglecting the inherent temporal information embedded within action sequences.\\nTo address this, we reframe imitation learning policies through the lens of the\\nfrequency domain and introduce the Wavelet Policy. This novel approach employs\\nwavelet transforms (WT) for feature preprocessing and extracts multi-scale\\nfeatures from the frequency domain using the SE2MD (Single Encoder to Multiple\\nDecoder) architecture. Furthermore, to enhance feature mapping in the frequency\\ndomain and increase model capacity, we introduce a Learnable Frequency-Domain\\nFilter (LFDF) after each frequency decoder, improving adaptability under\\ndifferent visual conditions. Our results show that the Wavelet Policy\\noutperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) end-to-end methods by over 10% on four\\nchallenging robotic arm tasks, while maintaining a comparable parameter count.\\nIn long-range settings, its performance declines more slowly as task volume\\nincreases. The code will be publicly available.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:16:45Z\"}"}
