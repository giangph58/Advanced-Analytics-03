Specifically, let $G$ be a closed linear group with Cartan\\ndecomposition $G \\\\cong K \\\\times \\\\exp(\\\\mathfrak{p}_0)$, where $K$ is a maximal\\ncompact subgroup acting transitively on the unit sphere. For $K$-invariant\\ncontinuous valuations on convex bodies, we establish an integral geometric-type\\nformula for $\\\\overline{G} = G \\\\ltimes V$. Key to our approach is the\\nintroduction of a Gaussian measure on $\\\\mathfrak{p}_0$, which ensures\\nconvergence of the non-compact part of the integral. In the special case $K =\\nO(n)$, we recover a Hadwiger-type formula involving intrinsic volumes, with\\nexplicit constants $c_j$ computed via a Weyl integration formula.\", \"main_category\": \"math.MG\", \"categories\": \"math.MG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T09:59:28Z\"}"}
