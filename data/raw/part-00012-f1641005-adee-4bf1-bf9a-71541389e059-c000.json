Apart from the design complexities of the hybrid\\nwind-wave energy systems, their energy conversion efficiency, power output\\nsmoothness and their safe operations introduce new challenges for their control\\nsystem designs. Recent studies show that advanced model-based control\\nstrategies have the great potential to significantly improve their overall\\ncontrol performance. However the performance of these advanced control\\nstrategies rely on the computationally efficient control-oriented models with\\nsufficient fidelity, which are normally difficult to derive due to the\\ncomplexity of the hydro-, aero-dynamic effects and the couplings.In most\\navailable results, the hybrid wind-wave energy system models are established by\\nusing the Boundary Element Method, devoting to understanding the hydrodynamic\\nresponses and performance analysis. However, such models are complex and\\ninvolved relatively heavy computational burden, which cannot be directly used\\nfor the advanced model-based control methods that are essential for improving\\npower capture efficiency from implementing in practice. To overcome this issue,\\nthis paper proposes a control-oriented model of the hybrid windwave energy\\nsystem with six degrees of freedom.
