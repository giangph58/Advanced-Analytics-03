{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12622v1\", \"title\": \"Can metric radio bursts be used as a diagnostics tool for interplanetary\\n  coronal mass ejections?\", \"summary\": \"Metric radio bursts are often said to be valuable diagnostic tools for\\nstudying the near-sun kinematics and energetics of the Interplanetary Coronal\\nMass Ejections (ICMEs). Radio observations also serve as an indirect tool to\\nestimate the coronal magnetic fields. However, how these estimated coronal\\nmagnetic fields are related to the magnetic field strength in the ICME at 1 AU\\nhas rarely been explored. We aim to establish a relation between the coronal\\nmagnetic fields obtained from the radio observations very close to the Sun and\\nthe magnetic field measured at 1 AU when the ICME arrives at the Earth. We\\nperformed statistical analysis of all metric type II radio bursts in solar\\ncycles 23 and 24, which were found to be associated with ICMEs. We estimated\\nthe coronal magnetic field associated with the corresponding CME near the Sun\\n(middle corona) using a split-band radio technique and compared those with the\\nmagnetic fields recorded at 1 AU with in-situ observations. We found that the\\nestimated magnetic fields near the Sun using radio techniques are not well\\ncorrelated with the magnetic fields measured at 1 AU using in-situ\\nobservations. This could be due to the complex evolution of the magnetic field\\nas it propagates through the heliosphere. Our results suggest that while metric\\nradio observations can serve as effective proxies for estimating magnetic\\nfields near the Sun, they may not be as effective close to the Earth. At least,\\nno linear relation could be established using metric radio emissions to\\nestimate the magnetic fields at 1 AU with acceptable error margins.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,physics.space-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T03:55:30Z\"}"}
