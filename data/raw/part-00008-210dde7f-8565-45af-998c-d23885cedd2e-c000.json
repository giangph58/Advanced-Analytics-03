This paper is the first in a\\nseries on the construction of locally analytic $G$-representations which do not\\nlie in the principal series. Here we consider the case of the general linear\\ngroup $G=GL_{n+1}$ and locally analytic representations which are induced by\\ncuspidal modules of the Lie algebra. We prove that they are ind-admissible and\\nsatisfy the homological vanishing criterion in the definition of\\nsupercuspidality in the sense of Kohlhaase. In the case of $n=1$ we give a\\nproof of their topological irreducibility for certain cuspidal modules of\\ndegree 1.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RT\", \"categories\": \"math.RT,math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T12:08:00Z\"}"}
