First-arrival traveltime simulation relies on solving the eikonal\\nequation. The accuracy of conventional numerical solvers is limited to a\\nfinite-difference approximation. In recent years, physics-informed neural\\nnetworks (PINNs) have been applied to achieve this task. However, traditional\\nPINNs encounter challenges in accurately solving the eikonal equation,\\nespecially in cases where the model exhibits directional scaling differences.\\nThese challenges result in substantial traveltime prediction errors when the\\ntraveling distance is long. To improve the accuracy of PINN in traveltime\\nprediction, we incorporate the reciprocity principle as a constraint into the\\nPINN training framework. Based on the reciprocity principle, which states that\\nthe traveltime between two points remains invariant when their roles as source\\nand receiver are exchanged, we propose to apply this principle to multiple\\nsource-receiver pairs in PINN-based traveltime prediction. Furthermore, a\\ndynamic weighting mechanism is proposed to balance the contributions of the\\neikonal equation loss and the reciprocity-constrained loss during the training\\nprocess. This adaptive weighting evolves dynamically with the training epochs,\\nenhancing the convergency of the training process. Experiments conducted on a\\nsimple lens velocity model, the Overthrust velocity model, and a 3D velocity\\nmodel demonstrate that the introduction of the reciprocity-constrained PINN\\nsignificantly improves the accuracy of traveltime predictions.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.geo-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.geo-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T08:54:19Z\"}"}
