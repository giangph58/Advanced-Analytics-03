Here, we present MUSE spectroscopy to study the properties of four\\nknown dwarf satellites and one stellar stream (KK208) surrounding the nearby\\ngrand spiral M83, which resides together with the lenticular galaxy Cen A in\\nthe Centaurus group. This data complete the phase-space information for all\\nknown dwarf galaxies around M83 down to a completeness of $-$10 mag in the $V$\\nband. All studied objects have an intermediate to old and metal-poor stellar\\npopulation and follow the stellar luminosity-metallicity relation as defined by\\nthe Local Group dwarfs. For the stellar stream we serendipitously identify a\\npreviously unknown globular cluster, which is old and metal-poor. Two dwarf\\ngalaxies (NGC5264 and dw1341-29) may be a bound satellite of a satellite system\\ndue to their proximity and shared velocities. Having access to the positions\\nand velocities of 13 dwarfs around M83, we estimate the mass of the group with\\ndifferent estimators. Ranging between 1.3 and $3.0 \\\\times 10^{12}$ M$_\\\\odot$\\nfor the halo mass we find it to be larger than previously assumed. This may\\nimpact the previously reported tension for cold dark matter cosmology with the\\ncount of dwarf galaxies. In contrast to Cen A, we do not find a co-rotating\\nplane-of-satellites around M83.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:45:19Z\"}"}
