However, relying solely on neural networks for legality\\nguarantees raises concerns in many practical applications. In this paper, we\\npresent \\\\tool{DiffPattern}-Flex, a novel approach designed to generate reliable\\nlayout patterns efficiently. \\\\tool{DiffPattern}-Flex incorporates a new method\\nfor generating diverse topologies using a discrete diffusion model while\\nmaintaining a lossless and compute-efficient layout representation. To ensure\\nlegal pattern generation, we employ {an} optimization-based, white-box pattern\\nassessment process based on specific design rules. Furthermore, fast sampling\\nand efficient legalization technologies are employed to accelerate the\\ngeneration process. Experimental results across various benchmarks demonstrate\\nthat \\\\tool{DiffPattern}-Flex significantly outperforms existing methods and\\nexcels at producing reliable layout patterns.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T07:04:11Z\"}"}
