In this work, we show that\\ngeodesics can be computed in diffusion latent space, where the norm induced by\\nthe spatially-varying inner product is inversely proportional to the\\nprobability density. In this formulation, a path that traverses a high density\\n(that is, probable) region of image latent space is shorter than the equivalent\\npath through a low density region. We present algorithms for solving the\\nassociated initial and boundary value problems and show how to compute the\\nprobability density along the path and the geodesic distance between two\\npoints. Using these techniques, we analyze how closely video clips approximate\\ngeodesics in a pre-trained image diffusion space. Finally, we demonstrate how\\nthese techniques can be applied to training-free image sequence interpolation\\nand extrapolation, given a pre-trained image diffusion model.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T08:28:53Z\"}"}
