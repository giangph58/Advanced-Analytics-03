However, the conventional RIS can only reflect\\nthe incident signal. Hence, it provides a limited coverage, as compared to a\\nsimultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS). Prior works on the\\nSTAR-RIS address the power minimisation or the sum-rate maximisation problem by\\nreformulating the objective problem as a convex optimisation problem and then\\nemploying numerical tools like CVX to obtain the solution, which introduces\\nsignificant computational complexity leading to a huge runtime, making the\\nalgorithms impractical for real-world implementation. In this paper, we propose\\na low complexity solution for the optimisation of a multi-user STAR-RIS system,\\nwhere the non-convex optimisation problem is decomposed into multiple convex\\nsub-problems with closed-form optimal solutions. The simulation results\\nillustrate that our proposed algorithm achieves similar performance to\\nCVX-based solutions in the literature while being computationally efficient.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T12:15:58Z\"}"}
