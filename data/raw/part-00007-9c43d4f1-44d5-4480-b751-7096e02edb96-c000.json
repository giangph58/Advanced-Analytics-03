We are\\ninterested in the case when the variance of the objective function is large. We\\npropose to rely on replication and local modeling to cope with this\\nhigh-throughput regime, where the number of evaluations may become large to get\\naccurate results while still keeping good performance. We propose several\\nschemes to encourage replication, from the choice of the acquisition function\\nto setup evaluation costs. Compared with existing methods, our results indicate\\ngood scaling, in terms of both accuracy (several orders of magnitude better\\nthan existing methods) and speed (taking into account evaluation costs).\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T08:13:16Z\"}"}
