The basic principle is illustrated by a\\nclassical example of two $7\\\\times 7$ matrices for which it is well known that\\neigenvalue computations fail when using standard double precision arithmetic.\\nWe then present an implementation of the Chebyshev tau-QZ method allowing the\\nuse of a large number of Chebyshev polynomials together with arbitrary\\nprecision arithmetic. This is used to compute the behavior of the spectra for\\nCouette and Poiseuille flow at high Reynolds number. An experimental\\nconvergence analysis finally makes it evident that high order precision is\\nrequired to obtain accurate results.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T10:59:01Z\"}"}
