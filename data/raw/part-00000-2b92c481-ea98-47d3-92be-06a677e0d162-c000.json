{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16891v1\", \"title\": \"AIMO-2 Winning Solution: Building State-of-the-Art Mathematical\\n  Reasoning Models with OpenMathReasoning dataset\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents our winning submission to the AI Mathematical Olympiad -\\nProgress Prize 2 (AIMO-2) competition. Our recipe for building state-of-the-art\\nmathematical reasoning models relies on three key pillars. First, we create a\\nlarge-scale dataset comprising 540K unique high-quality math problems,\\nincluding olympiad-level problems, and their 3.2M long-reasoning solutions.\\nSecond, we develop a novel method to integrate code execution with long\\nreasoning models through iterative training, generation, and quality filtering,\\nresulting in 1.7M high-quality Tool-Integrated Reasoning solutions. Third, we\\ncreate a pipeline to train models to select the most promising solution from\\nmany candidates. We show that such generative solution selection (GenSelect)\\ncan significantly improve upon majority voting baseline. Combining these ideas,\\nwe train a series of models that achieve state-of-the-art results on\\nmathematical reasoning benchmarks. To facilitate further research, we release\\nour code, models, and the complete OpenMathReasoning dataset under a\\ncommercially permissive license.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.CL,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T17:13:04Z\"}"}
