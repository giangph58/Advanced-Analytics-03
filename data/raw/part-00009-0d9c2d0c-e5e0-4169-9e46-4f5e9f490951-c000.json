As dictated by Hard Thermal Loop resummation, the\\nspectrum of equilibrated quasiparticles is richer than in vacuum, with a\\nmassless gauge field possessing three independent polarization states\\n(``plasmons''), and a massless fermion developing a novel branch\\n(``plasmino''). Furthermore, once the Higgs phenomenon sets in, vacuum and\\nthermal mass corrections interfere. We collect together the corresponding poles\\nand residues for the Standard Model around its crossover temperature. Choosing\\nits singlet scalar extension for illustration, we subsequently demonstrate,\\nboth numerically and via power counting, and in accordance with general\\ntheoretical expectations, how in the freeze-out of TeV-scale dark matter, these\\neffects remain well hidden in the inclusive annihilation cross section. In\\nparticular, the dominant (longitudinal) gauge channel is shown to be\\npractically temperature-independent. Cosmological constraints on TeV-scale\\nsinglet scalars are reconfirmed.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:00:53Z\"}"}
