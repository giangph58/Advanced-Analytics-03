We\\ndetect a transient, variable source notable for its strong variability and hard\\nspectrum. The emission from 4XMM J175136.8-275858 is well characterised by a\\nblackbody, with temperatures between $\\\\sim$1.8--5\\\\,keV during its lower\\nluminosity phase. Its temperature is poorly constrained during its brightest\\nphase, and we observe an increase in luminosity by two orders of magnitude over\\ntimescales of a few ks. This is driven by increased emission of X-rays at\\nenergies above 2\\\\,keV, with a luminosity decay potentially over weeks or\\nmonths. Derived luminosities for 4XJ1751-2759 range up to $\\\\sim10^{35}\\n\\\\text{\\\\,erg s}^{-1}$ at 8\\\\,kpc at the Galactic centre, but neutral hydrogen\\ncolumn densities are greater than predicted Galactic values possibly implying a\\ngreater distance to the source, still within our galaxy, further increasing its\\nluminosity. A consideration of optical and IR information in combination with\\nthe X-ray observations allow us to exclude the possibility that 4XJ1751-2759 is\\na star, rotationally powered pulsar or supergiant fast X-ray transient. This\\nrapid, hard, variability is closest to that of outbursts in magnetars than any\\nother known class of X-ray transient.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T07:58:47Z\"}"}
