{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11330v1\", \"title\": \"Decorrelation in Complex Wave Scattering\", \"summary\": \"Phenomena involving multiple scattering, despite having attracted\\nconsiderable attention in physics for decades, continue to generate unexpected\\nand counterintuitive behaviours prompting further studies. For optical\\nscattering, the memory effect well predicts fourth order statistics, i.e. the\\nintensity correlation, as long as the scattering strength and depth are within\\ncertain bounds. The memory effect has found a wide range of applications, where\\nits limitations also become apparent: for example, in imaging through turbid\\nmedia, decorrelation due to multiscattering in thick samples has been shown to\\nrestrict the field of view. However, to our knowledge, no comprehensive\\nmechanism exists to date that can account for decorrelation precisely. In this\\npaper, we quantify how the scatterer's own statistics determine such\\nlimitations. We show that the ensemble statistics of the backscattered field\\nmay be decomposed into two terms: one expresses surface scattering, where\\nstatistical distributions of multiscale structure features may be inferred from\\nour previous works; while the second term originates from the underlying\\nscattering volume and is diffusive. The new framework agrees well with\\nexperiments, including the prediction of a new quasipower law for fluctuations\\ninduced by the single realization.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:04:02Z\"}"}
