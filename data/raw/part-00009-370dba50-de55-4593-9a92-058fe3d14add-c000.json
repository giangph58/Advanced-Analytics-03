Recently, a string of results \\\\cite{diPierro_2018,\\nmengoni2019persistenthomologyanalysismultiqubit, bart2023, hamilton2023probing}\\nhave proposed using tools from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to attach\\ntopological quantities to multipartite states. However, these quantities are\\nnot directly connected to concrete information processing tasks making their\\ninterpretations vague. We take the first steps in connecting these abstract\\ntopological quantities to operational interpretations of entanglement in two\\nscenarios. The first is we provide a bound on the Integrated Euler\\nCharacteristic defined by Hamilton and Leditzky in \\\\cite{hamilton2023probing}\\nvia an average distillable entanglement, which we develop as a generalization\\nof the Meyer-Wallach entanglement measure studied by Scott in\\n\\\\cite{Scott_k-uniform}. This allows us to connect the distance of an error\\ncorrecting code to the Integrated Euler Characteristic. The second is we\\nprovide a characterization of graph states via the birth and death times of the\\nconnected components and 1-dimensional cycles of the entanglement complex. In\\nother words, the entanglement distance behavior of the first Betti number\\n$\\\\beta_1(\\\\varepsilon)$ allows us to determine if a state is locally equivalent\\nto a GHZ state, potentially providing new verification schemes for highly\\nentangled states.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T16:31:36Z\"}"}
