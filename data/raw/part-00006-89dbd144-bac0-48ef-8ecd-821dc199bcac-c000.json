Since all the points in the de Sitter space are\\nequivalent, this state is described by local thermodynamics. This state has the\\nlocal temperature $T=H/\\\\pi$ (which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature),\\nthe local entropy density, the local energy density, and also the local\\ngravitational degrees of freedom -- the scalar curvature ${\\\\cal R}$ and the\\neffective gravitational coupling $K$. On the other hand, there is the\\ncosmological horizon, which can be also characterized by the thermodynamic\\nrelations. We consider the connections between the local thermodynamics and the\\nthermodynamics of the cosmological horizon. In particular, there is the\\nholographic connection between the entropy density integrated over the Hubble\\nvolume and the Gibbons-Hawking entropy of the horizon, $S_{\\\\rm volume}=S_{\\\\rm\\nhorizon}=A/4G$. We also consider the first law of thermodynamics in these two\\napproaches. In the local thermodynamics, on the one hand, the first law is\\nvalid for an arbitrary volume $V$ of de Sitter space. On the other hand, the\\nfirst law is also applicable to the thermodynamics of the horizon. In both\\ncases, the temperature is the same. This consideration is extended to the\\ncontracting de Sitter with its negative entropy, $S_{\\\\rm volume}=S_{\\\\rm\\nhorizon}=-A/4G$.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T07:43:36Z\"}"}
