{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15737v1\", \"title\": \"Energy-Efficient SIM-assisted Communications: How Many Layers Do We\\n  Need?\", \"summary\": \"The stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM), comprising multiple layers of\\nreconfigurable transmissive metasurfaces, is becoming an increasingly viable\\nsolution for future wireless communication systems. In this paper, we explore\\nthe integration of SIM in a multi-antenna base station for application to\\ndownlink multi-user communications, and a realistic power consumption model for\\nSIM-assisted systems is presented. Specifically, we focus on maximizing the\\nenergy efficiency (EE) for hybrid precoding design, i.e., the base station\\ndigital precoding and SIM wave-based beamforming. Due to the non-convexity and\\nhigh complexity of the formulated problem, we employ the quadratic\\ntransformation method to reformulate the optimization problem and propose an\\nalternating optimization (AO)-based joint precoding framework. Specifically, a\\nsuccessive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm is adopted for the base station\\nprecoding design. For the SIM wave-based beamforming, two algorithms are\\nemployed: the high-performance semidefinite programming (SDP) method and the\\nlow-complexity projected gradient ascent (PGA) algorithm. In particular, the\\nresults indicate that while the optimal number of SIM layers for maximizing the\\nEE and spectral efficiency differs, a design of 2 to 5 layers can achieve\\nsatisfactory performance for both. Finally, numerical results are illustrated\\nto evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid precoding framework and to\\nshowcase the performance enhancement achieved by the algorithm in comparison to\\nbenchmark schemes.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,eess.SP,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T09:31:55Z\"}"}
