Our generic model\\nincludes Cox-type models and marked point processes as well as multivariate\\npoint processes. An oracle inequality and a rate of convergence are derived for\\nthe prediction error. A simulation study shows that the marked point process\\ncan be superior to the simple multivariate model in prediction.
