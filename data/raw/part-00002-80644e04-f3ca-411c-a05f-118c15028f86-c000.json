We design suitable resource management techniques that can\\nsimultaneously cater to those heterogeneous requirements, and scale\\nappropriately with the high-dimensional and discrete nature of the problem. We\\npropose a novel active learning framework where resource allocation patterns\\nare drawn sequentially, evaluated in the environment, and then used to\\niteratively update a surrogate model of the environment. Our method leverages a\\ngenerative flow network (GFlowNet) to sample favorable solutions, as such\\nmodels are trained to generate compositional objects proportionally to their\\ntraining reward, hence providing an appropriate coverage of its modes. As such,\\nGFlowNet generates diverse and high return resource management designs that\\nupdate the surrogate model and swiftly discover suitable solutions. We provide\\nsimulation results showing that our method can allocate radio resources\\nachieving 20% performance gains against benchmarks, while requiring less than\\nhalf of the number of acquisition rounds.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:16:40Z\"}"}
