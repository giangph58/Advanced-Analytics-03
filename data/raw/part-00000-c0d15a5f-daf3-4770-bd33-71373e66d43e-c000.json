{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21471v1\", \"title\": \"Efficiently Finding All Minimal and Shortest Absent Subsequences in a\\n  String\", \"summary\": \"Given a string $w$, another string $v$ is said to be a subsequence of $w$ if\\n$v$ can be obtained from $w$ by removing some of its letters; on the other\\nhand, $v$ is called an absent subsequence of $w$ if $v$ is not a subsequence of\\n$w$. The existing literature on absent subsequences focused on understanding,\\nfor a string $w$, the set of its shortest absent subsequences (i.e., the\\nshortest strings which are absent subsequences of $w$) and that of its minimal\\nabsent subsequences (i.e., those strings which are absent subsequences of $w$\\nbut whose every proper subsequence occurs in $w$). Our contributions to this\\narea of research are the following. Firstly, we present optimal algorithms\\n(with linear time preprocessing and output-linear delay) for the enumeration of\\nthe shortest and, respectively, minimal absent subsequences. Secondly, we\\npresent optimal algorithms for the incremental enumeration of these strings\\nwith linear time preprocessing and constant delay; in this setting, we only\\noutput short edit-scripts showing how the currently enumerated string differs\\nfrom the previous one. Finally, we provide an efficient algorithm for\\nidentifying a longest minimal absent subsequence of a string. All our\\nalgorithms improve the state-of-the-art results for the aforementioned\\nproblems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS,cs.FL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T09:48:47Z\"}"}
