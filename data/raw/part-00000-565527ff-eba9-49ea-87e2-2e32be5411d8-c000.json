{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20681v1\", \"title\": \"Data Encryption Battlefield: A Deep Dive into the Dynamic Confrontations\\n  in Ransomware Attacks\", \"summary\": \"In the rapidly evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats, ransomware\\nrepresents a significant challenge. Attackers increasingly employ sophisticated\\nencryption methods, such as entropy reduction through Base64 encoding, and\\npartial or intermittent encryption to evade traditional detection methods. This\\nstudy explores the dynamic battle between adversaries who continuously refine\\nencryption strategies and defenders developing advanced countermeasures to\\nprotect vulnerable data. We investigate the application of online incremental\\nmachine learning algorithms designed to predict file encryption activities\\ndespite adversaries evolving obfuscation techniques. Our analysis utilizes an\\nextensive dataset of 32.6 GB, comprising 11,928 files across multiple formats,\\nincluding Microsoft Word documents (doc), PowerPoint presentations (ppt), Excel\\nspreadsheets (xlsx), image formats (jpg, jpeg, png, tif, gif), PDFs (pdf),\\naudio (mp3), and video (mp4) files. These files were encrypted by 75 distinct\\nransomware families, facilitating a robust empirical evaluation of machine\\nlearning classifiers effectiveness against diverse encryption tactics. Results\\nhighlight the Hoeffding Tree algorithms superior incremental learning\\ncapability, particularly effective in detecting traditional and AES-Base64\\nencryption methods employed to lower entropy. Conversely, the Random Forest\\nclassifier with warm-start functionality excels at identifying intermittent\\nencryption methods, demonstrating the necessity of tailored machine learning\\nsolutions to counter sophisticated ransomware strategies.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T12:01:43Z\"}"}
