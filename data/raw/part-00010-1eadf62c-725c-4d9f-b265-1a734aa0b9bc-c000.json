We\\nfurther assess the evolving software ecosystem, from specialized simulators and\\ndifferentiable-programming libraries to extensions of mainstream frameworks. We\\nalso identify key challenges in control complexity, noise management, and\\ntooling maturity.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T11:54:06Z\"}"}
