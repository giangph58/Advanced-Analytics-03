{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00466v1\", \"title\": \"A Generalised Framework for Property-Driven Machine Learning\", \"summary\": \"Neural networks have been shown to frequently fail to satisfy critical safety\\nand correctness properties after training, highlighting the pressing need for\\ntraining methods that incorporate such properties directly. While adversarial\\ntraining can be used to improve robustness to small perturbations within\\n$\\\\epsilon$-cubes, domains other than computer vision -- such as control systems\\nand natural language processing -- may require more flexible input region\\nspecifications via generalised hyper-rectangles. Meanwhile, differentiable\\nlogics offer a way to encode arbitrary logical constraints as additional loss\\nterms that guide the learning process towards satisfying these constraints. In\\nthis paper, we investigate how these two complementary approaches can be\\nunified within a single framework for property-driven machine learning. We show\\nthat well-known properties from the literature are subcases of this general\\napproach, and we demonstrate its practical effectiveness on a case study\\ninvolving a neural network controller for a drone system.
