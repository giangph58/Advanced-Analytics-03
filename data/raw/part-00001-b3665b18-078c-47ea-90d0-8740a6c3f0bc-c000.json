However, acquiring such data is often costly and\\ntime-consuming, especially for non-English languages such as Italian. Recently,\\nresearchers have begun to explore the use of LLMs to generate synthetic\\ndatasets as a viable alternative. This study proposes a pipeline for generating\\nsynthetic data and a comprehensive approach for investigating the factors that\\ninfluence the validity of synthetic data generated by LLMs by examining how\\nmodel performance is affected by metrics such as prompt strategy, text length\\nand target position in a specific task, i.e. inclusive language detection in\\nItalian job advertisements. Our results show that, in most cases and across\\ndifferent metrics, the fine-tuned models trained on synthetic data consistently\\noutperformed other models on both real and synthetic test datasets. The study\\ndiscusses the practical implications and limitations of using synthetic data\\nfor language detection tasks with LLMs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:22:34Z\"}"}
