{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21699v1\", \"title\": \"REHEARSE-3D: A Multi-modal Emulated Rain Dataset for 3D Point Cloud\\n  De-raining\", \"summary\": \"Sensor degradation poses a significant challenge in autonomous driving.\\nDuring heavy rainfall, the interference from raindrops can adversely affect the\\nquality of LiDAR point clouds, resulting in, for instance, inaccurate point\\nmeasurements. This, in turn, can potentially lead to safety concerns if\\nautonomous driving systems are not weather-aware, i.e., if they are unable to\\ndiscern such changes. In this study, we release a new, large-scale, multi-modal\\nemulated rain dataset, REHEARSE-3D, to promote research advancements in 3D\\npoint cloud de-raining. Distinct from the most relevant competitors, our\\ndataset is unique in several respects. First, it is the largest point-wise\\nannotated dataset, and second, it is the only one with high-resolution LiDAR\\ndata (LiDAR-256) enriched with 4D Radar point clouds logged in both daytime and\\nnighttime conditions in a controlled weather environment. Furthermore,\\nREHEARSE-3D involves rain-characteristic information, which is of significant\\nvalue not only for sensor noise modeling but also for analyzing the impact of\\nweather at a point level. Leveraging REHEARSE-3D, we benchmark raindrop\\ndetection and removal in fused LiDAR and 4D Radar point clouds. Our\\ncomprehensive study further evaluates the performance of various statistical\\nand deep-learning models. Upon publication, the dataset and benchmark models\\nwill be made publicly available at: https://sporsho.github.io/REHEARSE3D.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:43:38Z\"}"}
