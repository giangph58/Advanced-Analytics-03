{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19699v1\", \"title\": \"Optimal Virtual Power Plant Investment Planning via Time Series\\n  Aggregation with Bounded Error\", \"summary\": \"This study addresses the investment planning problem of a virtual power plant\\n(VPP), formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. As the\\nnumber of binary variables increases and the investment time horizon extends,\\nthe problem can become computationally intractable. To mitigate this issue,\\ntime series aggregation (TSA) methods are commonly employed. However, since TSA\\ntypically results in a loss of accuracy, it is standard practice to derive\\nbounds to control the associated error. Existing methods validate these bounds\\nonly in the linear case, and when applied to MILP models, they often yield\\nheuristics that may even produce infeasible solutions. To bridge this gap, we\\npropose an iterative TSA method for solving the VPP investment planning problem\\nformulated as a MILP model, while ensuring a bounded error in the objective\\nfunction. Our main theoretical contribution is to formally demonstrate that the\\nderived bounds remain valid at each iteration. Notably, the proposed method\\nconsistently guarantees feasible solutions throughout the iterative process.\\nNumerical results show that the proposed TSA method achieves superior\\ncomputational efficiency compared to standard full-scale optimization.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T11:54:12Z\"}"}
