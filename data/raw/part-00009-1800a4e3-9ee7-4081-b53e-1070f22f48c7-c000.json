{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17424v1\", \"title\": \"Object Pose Estimation by Camera Arm Control Based on the Next Viewpoint\\n  Estimation\", \"summary\": \"We have developed a new method to estimate a Next Viewpoint (NV) which is\\neffective for pose estimation of simple-shaped products for product display\\nrobots in retail stores. Pose estimation methods using Neural Networks (NN)\\nbased on an RGBD camera are highly accurate, but their accuracy significantly\\ndecreases when the camera acquires few texture and shape features at a current\\nview point. However, it is difficult for previous mathematical model-based\\nmethods to estimate effective NV which is because the simple shaped objects\\nhave few shape features. Therefore, we focus on the relationship between the\\npose estimation and NV estimation. When the pose estimation is more accurate,\\nthe NV estimation is more accurate. Therefore, we develop a new pose estimation\\nNN that estimates NV simultaneously. Experimental results showed that our NV\\nestimation realized a pose estimation success rate 77.3\\\\%, which was 7.4pt\\nhigher than the mathematical model-based NV calculation did. Moreover, we\\nverified that the robot using our method displayed 84.2\\\\% of products.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T10:26:14Z\"}"}
