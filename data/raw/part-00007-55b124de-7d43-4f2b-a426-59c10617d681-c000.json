{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12281v1\", \"title\": \"A Near-Optimal Kernel for a Coloring Problem\", \"summary\": \"For a fixed integer $q$, the $q$-Coloring problem asks to decide if a given\\ngraph has a vertex coloring with $q$ colors such that no two adjacent vertices\\nreceive the same color. In a series of papers, it has been shown that for every\\n$q \\\\geq 3$, the $q$-Coloring problem parameterized by the vertex cover number\\n$k$ admits a kernel of bit-size $\\\\widetilde{O}(k^{q-1})$, but admits no kernel\\nof bit-size $O(k^{q-1-\\\\varepsilon})$ for $\\\\varepsilon >0$ unless $\\\\mathsf{NP}\\n\\\\subseteq \\\\mathsf{coNP/poly}$ (Jansen and Kratsch, 2013; Jansen and Pieterse,\\n2019). In 2020, Schalken proposed the question of the kernelizability of the\\n$q$-Coloring problem parameterized by the number $k$ of vertices whose removal\\nresults in a disjoint union of edges and isolated vertices. He proved that for\\nevery $q \\\\geq 3$, the problem admits a kernel of bit-size\\n$\\\\widetilde{O}(k^{2q-2})$, but admits no kernel of bit-size\\n$O(k^{2q-3-\\\\varepsilon})$ for $\\\\varepsilon >0$ unless $\\\\mathsf{NP} \\\\subseteq\\n\\\\mathsf{coNP/poly}$. He further proved that for $q \\\\in \\\\{3,4\\\\}$ the problem\\nadmits a near-optimal kernel of bit-size $\\\\widetilde{O}(k^{2q-3})$ and asked\\nwhether such a kernel is achievable for all integers $q \\\\geq 3$. In this short\\npaper, we settle this question in the affirmative.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T17:44:33Z\"}"}
