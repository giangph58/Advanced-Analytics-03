However, during the charging process, the parasitic\\nhydrogen evolution reaction at the negative electrode affects the performance\\nand durability of VFRBs. The evolution of hydrogen bubbles causes the loss of\\neffective reaction area and blocks the transport of reactants. We employ the\\nlattice Boltzmann method to investigate the two-phase flow transport in the\\nnegative electrode of VRFBs. Systematic parametric analyses reveal that\\nincreased gas production leads to uneven gas removal from the electrode, while\\nan optimal flow rate can effectively remove bubbles and reduce external pumping\\nenergy. Additionally, increasing the compression ratio hinders gas removal but\\nenhances electrode electrical conductivity. Overall, the present study provides\\nvaluable mechanistic insights into bubble generation at the negative electrode\\nof VRFBs and offers a theoretical reference for designing and optimizing VRFBs.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:23:00Z\"}"}
