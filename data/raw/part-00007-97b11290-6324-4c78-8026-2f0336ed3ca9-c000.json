Through 14 semi-structured interviews, we analyse waiting\\ntime and repetitive UI itneractions as key burdens that contribute to 'digital\\ndiscomfort' for gig based food delivery agents. We find that workers employ\\ncreative strategies to navigate algorithmic management, yet remain constrained\\nby platform-side 'gamification' and system opacity. We propose worker-centered\\nGUI automation as a potential intervention to reduce friction while preserving\\nagency. In conclusion, this position paper argues for rethinking HCI approaches\\nin the Global South to prioritise worker autonomy over efficiency-driven design\\noptimisations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T16:06:26Z\"}"}
