In this study, we present the first comprehensive analysis of\\nthis catalytic effect during supercooled PTs within the high PBH number density\\nregime. Applying the analytical model with envelope approximation, we derive\\nthe general expressions of GW spectrum in the presence of PBHs. We find that at\\nrelatively small PBH number densities, the GW signals are amplified due to the\\nlarge-size bubbles. While higher PBH number densities suppress GW signals,\\nsince the accelerated PT progresses too rapidly. We further extend our findings\\nto the bulk flow model and to scalar-induced GWs (SIGWs) generated during PTs.\\nBy conducting data fitting with the NANOGrav 15-year dataset, we find that the\\nPBH catalytic effect significantly alters the estimation of PT parameters.\\nNotably, our analysis of the bubble collision GWs reveals that, the\\nasteroid-mass PBHs ($10^{-16} - 10^{-12} M_\\\\odot$) as the whole dark matter is\\nincompatible with the PT interpretation of pulsar timing array signals.\\nHowever, incorporating SIGWs can reduce this incompatibility for PBHs in the\\nmass range $10^{-14} - 10^{-12} M_\\\\odot$.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T14:13:17Z\"}"}
