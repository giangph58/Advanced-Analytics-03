We found the system in a\\nvisually bright state and the eclipse time of minimum consistent with the\\npublished ephemeris. The eclipse profile showed that the hot component was an\\nextended object rather than an isolated white dwarf. By analyzing the eclipse\\nprofile we estimated the orbital inclination to be 67.9{\\\\deg}, the radius of\\nthe extended hot component surrounding the white dwarf to be 39.3 Rsun, and\\nthat the red giant star was probably filling its Roche Lobe. From our flux\\ncalibrated spectra, we determined the brightest component of the system to be\\nthe hot component whose continuum and emission lines together are responsible\\nfor 83% of the V-band light. The circumbinary nebula and its emission lines\\ncontribute over 14%, while the red giant is responsible for less than 3%. Our\\nspectra revealed a rich harvest of low ionization emission lines. By measuring\\nhow flux in these emission lines varied through the eclipse, we have provided\\ninformation which should prove useful for future modelling of this symbiotic\\nsystem.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:22:23Z\"}"}
