For this purpose, two non-parametric approaches, namely,\\nthe Gaussian Process (GP) and the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been\\nemployed and using the Hubble data from Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Pantheon+\\nfrom Supernovae Type Ia and their combination we have reconstructed the\\ninteraction function. We find that for $w_{\\\\rm DE} =-1$, the interaction in the\\ndark sector is not prominent while for $w_{\\\\rm DE} \\\\neq -1$, evidence of\\ninteraction is found depending on the value of $w_{\\\\rm DE}$. In particularly,\\nwe find that if we start deviating from $w_{\\\\rm DE} = -1$ either in the\\nquintessence ($w_{\\\\rm DE} > -1$) or phantom ($w_{\\\\rm DE} < -1$) direction, an\\nemergence of dark interaction is observed from both GP and ANN reconstructions.\\nWe further note that ANN which is applied for the first time in this context\\nseems to play a very efficient role compared to GP.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T11:33:48Z\"}"}
