In magnetic\\nmaterials, skyrmions manifest as stable, mobile spin textures, positioning them\\nat the forefront of spintronics research. Meanwhile, their optical counterparts\\nunlock new possibilities for manipulating and directing light at the nanoscale.\\nExploring the territories where magnetism and optics meet therefore holds\\nimmense promise for ultrafast control over magnetic processes. Here, we report\\nthe generation of a skyrmion-topological lattice through the inverse Faraday\\neffect in a plasmonic metasurface. Specifically, a hexagonal array of gold\\nnanodisks induces unidirectional drift photocurrents in each nanodisk, while\\ncounterpropagating phantom currents arise in the hexagonal interstices. This\\ninterplay creates a lattice of skyrmionic magnetic textures. Crucially, the all\\noptical, large scale formation of skyrmions potentially at ultrafast timescales\\noffers a pathway for integrating these topological spin textures into magnetic\\nmaterials, laying the groundwork for next-generation data storage and\\nprocessing technologies.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T07:24:02Z\"}"}
