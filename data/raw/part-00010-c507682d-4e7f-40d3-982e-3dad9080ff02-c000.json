Conventional methods for computing $n$-time correlation functions on\\nquantum computers, such as the Hadamard test, generally require an ancilla\\nqubit that controls the entire system -- an approach that poses challenges for\\ndigital quantum devices with limited qubit connectivity, as well as for analog\\nquantum platforms lacking controlled operations. Here, we introduce a method to\\ncompute $n$-time correlation functions using only unitary evolutions on the\\nsystem of interest, thereby eliminating the need for ancillas and the control\\noperations. This approach substantially relaxes hardware connectivity\\nrequirements for digital processors and enables more practical measurements of\\n$n$-time correlation functions on analog platforms. We demonstrate our protocol\\non IBM quantum hardware up to 12 qubits to measure fermionic and bosonic\\nsingle-particle spectra of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and the Schwinger\\nmodel, respectively, and the out-of-time-order correlator in the\\ntransverse-field Ising model. In the experiment, we further introduce a\\nsignal-processing strategy that integrates signal filtering and correlation\\nanalysis, and successfully reproduces the noiseless simulation results from the\\nnoisy hardware. Our work highlights a route to exploring complex quantum\\nmany-body correlation functions in practice, even in the presence of realistic\\nhardware limitations and noise.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T14:27:23Z\"}"}
