The initial conditions on these matter fields have been kept to be\\nquite general: the initial velocity profile of the matter is taken to include\\nboth the bound and the marginally bound models, while the density profile of\\nthe initial matter configuration is assumed to have physically admissible\\nportrayal, and smooth falloffs. We determine, under these general conditions,\\nthe time of formation of the central singularity and the formation and\\nevolution of black hole horizons, depicted here in terms of quasilocal\\nmarginally trapped surfaces. Our study shows that under these general\\nconditions, the central singularity remains hidden from the asymptotic\\nobserver.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:00:35Z\"}"}
