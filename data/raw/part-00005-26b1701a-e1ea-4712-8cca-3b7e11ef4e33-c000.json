The\\nMitchell Institute Neutrino Experiment at Reactor (MINER), conducted at the\\nNuclear Science Center of Texas A&M University, investigated ALPs near a 1 MW\\nTRIGA nuclear reactor core, positioned approximately 4 meters away. This\\nexperiment employed cryogenic sapphire detectors with a low detection threshold\\n(approximately 100 eV), equipped with a Transition Edge Sensor capable of\\ndetecting athermal phonons. Due to the low-background environment, we were able\\nto exclude ALPs with axion-photon coupling and axion-electron coupling as small\\nas \\\\(g_{a\\\\gamma\\\\gamma} = 10^{-5}\\\\) and \\\\(g_{aee} = 10^{-7}\\\\), respectively.\\nEnergy depositions below 3 keV were not considered and remain blinded for our\\nCoherent Elastic Neutrino Nucleus Scattering (CEvNS) analysis. This is the\\nfirst result demonstrating the MINER experiment's potential to probe low-mass\\nALPs, enabled by its low-threshold detector and proximity to a reactor.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:32:20Z\"}"}
