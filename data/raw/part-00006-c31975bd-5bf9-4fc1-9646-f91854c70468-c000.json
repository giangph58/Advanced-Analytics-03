We assume\\nthat long GRBs with $z\\\\geq 2$ are all collapsar GRBs and construct the\\nluminosity function using a high-redshift sample from the Swift satellite\\nspanning 2004 to 2019. We model the luminosity function with a broken power-law\\nform and consider three scenarios: no evolution, luminosity evolution, and\\ndensity evolution. Our results are as follows: 1) The no-evolution model can be\\nruled out. 2) The fitting results indicate that to adequately explain the\\nobservations, a significant redshift evolution in either luminosity (evolution\\nindex $\\\\delta = 1.54^{+0.21}_{-0.22}$) or density ($\\\\delta =\\n2.09^{+0.29}_{-0.26}$) is required. This excludes the possibility that the\\nevolution of long GRBs with redshift is due to contamination from non-collapsar\\nGRBs. 3) The luminosity evolution model predicts that the number of collapsar\\nGRBs with $z<2$ and $P \\\\geq 1 \\\\, \\\\text{ph} \\\\, \\\\text{cm}^{-2} \\\\, \\\\text{s}^{-1}$\\nis 138.6, accounting for 82.5% of the observed long GRBs with $z<2$ and $P \\\\geq\\n1 \\\\, \\\\text{ph} \\\\, \\\\text{cm}^{-2} \\\\, \\\\text{s}^{-1}$. The density evolution model\\npredicts that the number of collapsar GRBs with $z<2$ and $P \\\\geq 1 \\\\,\\n\\\\text{ph} \\\\, \\\\text{cm}^{-2} \\\\, \\\\text{s}^{-1}$ is 80.2, accounting for 47.7% of\\nthe observation. Regardless of the model, a substantial portion of the long\\nGRBs are not collapsar GRBs.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T17:58:21Z\"}"}
