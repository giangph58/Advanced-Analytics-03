EmbodiedAgent addresses critical limitations\\nof hallucination in impractical tasks. Our approach integrates a next-action\\nprediction paradigm with a structured memory system to decompose tasks into\\nexecutable robot skills while dynamically validating actions against\\nenvironmental constraints. We present MultiPlan+, a dataset of more than 18,000\\nannotated planning instances spanning 100 scenarios, including a subset of\\nimpractical cases to mitigate hallucination. To evaluate performance, we\\npropose the Robot Planning Assessment Schema (RPAS), combining automated\\nmetrics with LLM-aided expert grading. Experiments demonstrate EmbodiedAgent's\\nsuperiority over state-of-the-art models, achieving 71.85% RPAS score.\\nReal-world validation in an office service task highlights its ability to\\ncoordinate heterogeneous robots for long-horizon objectives.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:33:42Z\"}"}
