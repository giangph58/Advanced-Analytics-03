The NLO amplitudes possess large imaginary parts that have\\nsigns opposite to those of the leading-order amplitudes. This cancellation\\neffect implies that the NLO contribution does not significantly influence the\\nbranching ratios of the processes under consideration. However, the NLO effect\\nexplored in this work constitutes an important source of the strong phases in\\nthe weak - annihilation non-leptonic $\\\\bar B_q$-meson decay amplitudes. As a\\nresult, it can have a substantial impact on CP - violating observables such as\\nthe direct CP asymmetry ${\\\\cal A}_{\\\\rm CP}^{\\\\rm dir}$ and mixing induced CP\\nasymmetry ${\\\\cal A}_{\\\\rm CP}^{\\\\rm mix}$. The numerical result evidently\\nrevealed that NLO QCD correction significantly enhances both ${\\\\cal A}_{\\\\rm\\nCP}^{\\\\rm dir}$ and ${\\\\cal A}_{\\\\rm CP}^{\\\\rm mix}$ of the pure annihilation type\\nB decay processes.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T10:02:32Z\"}"}
