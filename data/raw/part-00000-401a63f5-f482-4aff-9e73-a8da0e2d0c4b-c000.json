Saikika proved some identities\\nrelating certain restricted partitions into distinct odd parts with the\\npartition whose odd parts are distinct combinatorially. They asked for the\\nq-series proofs. In this paper, we give q-series proofs of these identities.\\nAlso, the number of partitions into distinct odd parts equals to the number of\\nthe partitions with no parts congruent to 2 mod 4, so we can get some\\nidentities. We also give combinatorial proofs of these identities.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T12:27:58Z\"}"}
