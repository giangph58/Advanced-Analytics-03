Despite its significance, research in this domain remains\\nrelatively limited, with most existing studies concentrating on single-modal\\ntrajectory prediction of vehicles. In this work, we propose ParkDiffusion, a\\nnovel approach that predicts the trajectories of both vehicles and pedestrians\\nin automated parking scenarios. ParkDiffusion employs diffusion models to\\ncapture the inherent uncertainty and multi-modality of future trajectories,\\nincorporating several key innovations. First, we propose a dual map encoder\\nthat processes soft semantic cues and hard geometric constraints using a\\ntwo-step cross-attention mechanism. Second, we introduce an adaptive agent type\\nembedding module, which dynamically conditions the prediction process on the\\ndistinct characteristics of vehicles and pedestrians. Third, to ensure\\nkinematic feasibility, our model outputs control signals that are subsequently\\nused within a kinematic framework to generate physically feasible trajectories.\\nWe evaluate ParkDiffusion on the Dragon Lake Parking (DLP) dataset and the\\nIntersections Drone (inD) dataset. Our work establishes a new baseline for\\nheterogeneous trajectory prediction in parking scenarios, outperforming\\nexisting methods by a considerable margin.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T15:16:59Z\"}"}
