In particular, many models have been developed which characterize this\\ninteraction for low intensity laser fields. An atomic medium subject to an\\nexternal magnetic field of arbitrary direction exhibits two electric field\\nmodes that, in general, are non-orthogonal. Mode non-orthogonality is currently\\nneglected by the models used in this context. We derive a new light propagation\\nformalism which takes into account the non-zero overlap of the two modes. We\\nverify the theory using weak-probe spectroscopy of the Rb D$_{2}$ line, showing\\nexcellent agreement with experiment. The predictions of the new theory can be\\nexploited, and optimized, to design better atomic photonic devices.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T15:23:28Z\"}"}
