We conducted a search across 16 GCs that collectively host 93 known\\npulsars, as well as 14 GCs that do not contain any known pulsars. The majority\\nof these known pulsars were successfully re-detected in our survey. The few\\nnon-detections could be attributed to the high accelerations of these pulsars.\\nAdditionally, we have discovered a new binary millisecond pulsar, namely M13I\\n(or PSR J1641+3627I) in GC M13 (or NGC 6205), and obtained its phase-coherent\\ntiming solution using observations spanning 6 years. M13I has a spin period of\\n6.37 ms, and an orbital period of 18.23 days. The eccentricity of the binary\\norbit is 0.064, with a companion mass range of approximately 0.45 to 1.37\\nM$_{\\\\odot}$. The orbital properties of M13I are remarkably different from those\\nof the other known pulsars in M13, indicating that this pulsar has undergone a\\ndifferent evolutionary path compared to the rest.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T07:55:18Z\"}"}
