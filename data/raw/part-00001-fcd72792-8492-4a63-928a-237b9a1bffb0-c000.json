{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10470v1\", \"title\": \"Online Advanced Labs in Physics\", \"summary\": \"At Arizona State University we have built the first and only fully online\\nBachelor of Science degree in Physics, with a complete curriculum, including\\nlabs. The upper division Advanced Lab courses present a special challenge for\\nonline delivery. We address that using a set of custom-built simulator modules\\nthat replicate all the imperfections (noise, background, etc) inherent in\\nreal-world data. The set of experiments duplicates those of the in-person\\nclasses. In this paper, we present an overview of these labs and discuss the\\nadvantages and challenges of delivering them online. We assert that these labs\\nprovide a valid and rigorous component for the fully online degree. The entire\\nset of labs is available as Open Source Supplemental Materials and is shared\\nfor others to use in part or in whole, with suitable attribution.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ed-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ed-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:54:14Z\"}"}
