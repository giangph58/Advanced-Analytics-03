In this paper, we\\nconstruct an example of a non-compact totally complex submanifold of maximal\\ndimension of a compact quaternionic K\\\\\\\"{a}hler symmetric space, except for\\nquaternionic projective spaces. A compact Lie group acts on our example\\nisometrically, and this action is of cohomogeneity one. Our example is a\\nholomorphic line bundle over some Hermitian symmetric space of compact type.\\nMoreover, each fiber is a totally geodesic submanifold of the ambient\\nquaternionic K\\\\\\\"{a}hler symmetric space and our example is a ruled submanifold.\\nOur construction relies on the action of a subgroup of the isometry group and a\\nmaximal totally geodesic sphere with maximal sectional curvature known as a\\nHelgason sphere. Furthermore, we prove that there exist no compact submanifolds\\nof the same dimension that contain our example as an open part, except where\\nthe ambient quaternionic K\\\\\\\"{a}hler symmetric space is a complex Grassmannian.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T07:41:11Z\"}"}
