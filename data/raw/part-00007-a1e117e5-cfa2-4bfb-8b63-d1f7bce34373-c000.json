{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15121v1\", \"title\": \"Robust and Real-time Surface Normal Estimation from Stereo Disparities\\n  using Affine Transformations\", \"summary\": \"This work introduces a novel method for surface normal estimation from\\nrectified stereo image pairs, leveraging affine transformations derived from\\ndisparity values to achieve fast and accurate results. We demonstrate how the\\nrectification of stereo image pairs simplifies the process of surface normal\\nestimation by reducing computational complexity. To address noise reduction, we\\ndevelop a custom algorithm inspired by convolutional operations, tailored to\\nprocess disparity data efficiently. We also introduce adaptive heuristic\\ntechniques for efficiently detecting connected surface components within the\\nimages, further improving the robustness of the method. By integrating these\\nmethods, we construct a surface normal estimator that is both fast and\\naccurate, producing a dense, oriented point cloud as the final output. Our\\nmethod is validated using both simulated environments and real-world stereo\\nimages from the Middlebury and Cityscapes datasets, demonstrating significant\\nimprovements in real-time performance and accuracy when implemented on a GPU.\\nUpon acceptance, the shader source code will be made publicly available to\\nfacilitate further research and reproducibility.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T14:19:00Z\"}"}
