Our results show moral reasoning\\nperformance degrades with increasing context complexity, particularly for\\nlow-resource languages such as Vietnamese. We further fine-tune the open-source\\nLLaMA-3-8B model using curated monolingual data for alignment and poisoning.\\nSurprisingly, low-resource languages have a stronger impact on multilingual\\nreasoning than high-resource ones, highlighting their critical role in\\nmultilingual NLP.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T12:56:36Z\"}"}
