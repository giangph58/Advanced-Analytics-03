{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20898v1\", \"title\": \"CBM-RAG: Demonstrating Enhanced Interpretability in Radiology Report\\n  Generation with Multi-Agent RAG and Concept Bottleneck Models\", \"summary\": \"Advancements in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) hold great promise\\nfor automating radiology workflows, yet challenges in interpretability and\\nreliability hinder clinical adoption. This paper presents an automated\\nradiology report generation framework that combines Concept Bottleneck Models\\n(CBMs) with a Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to bridge\\nAI performance with clinical explainability. CBMs map chest X-ray features to\\nhuman-understandable clinical concepts, enabling transparent disease\\nclassification. Meanwhile, the RAG system integrates multi-agent collaboration\\nand external knowledge to produce contextually rich, evidence-based reports.\\nOur demonstration showcases the system's ability to deliver interpretable\\npredictions, mitigate hallucinations, and generate high-quality, tailored\\nreports with an interactive interface addressing accuracy, trust, and usability\\nchallenges. This framework provides a pathway to improving diagnostic\\nconsistency and empowering radiologists with actionable insights.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.CV,cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T16:14:55Z\"}"}
