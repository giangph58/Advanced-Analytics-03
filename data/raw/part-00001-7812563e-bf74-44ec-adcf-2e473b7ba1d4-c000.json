{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19466v1\", \"title\": \"The partial derivative of ratios of Schur polynomials\", \"summary\": \"We show that a ratio of Schur polynomials $s_{\\\\lambda}/s_{\\\\rho}$ associated\\nto partitions $\\\\lambda$ and $\\\\rho$ such $\\\\lambda\\\\subsetneq\\\\rho$ has a negative\\npartial derivative at any point where all variables are positive. This is\\naccomplished by establishing an injective map between sets of pairs of skew\\nsemistandard Young tableaux that preserves the product of the corresponding\\nmonomials. We use this result and the description of the first Laurent\\ncoefficient of the Hilbert series of the graded algebra of regular function on\\na linear symplectic quotient by the circle to demonstrate that many such\\nsymplectic quotients are not graded regularly diffeomorphic. In addition, we\\ngive an upper bound for this Laurent coefficient in terms of the largest two\\nweights of the circle representation and demonstrate that all but finitely many\\ncircle symplectic quotients of each dimension are not graded regularly\\ndiffeomorphic to linear symplectic quotients by $\\\\operatorname{SU}_2$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,math.SG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T04:11:22Z\"}"}
