We utilized a Fourier-based\\nimage correlation algorithm to stitch sequential video frames, aligning them\\nwith synchronized GNSS timestamps. The resulting compressed Keyhole Markup\\nLanguage files, compatible with geographic information systems such as Google\\nEarth, enable detailed spatial analysis. Validation through comparative\\nanalysis of mosaics from two temporally distinct surveys of the same reef\\ndemonstrated the software's consistent and reliable performance.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T11:29:45Z\"}"}
