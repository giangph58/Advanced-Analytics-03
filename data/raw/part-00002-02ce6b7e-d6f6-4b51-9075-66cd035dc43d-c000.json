A case study of a Video\\nCapsule Endoscopy (VCE) prototype is used to illustrate the system's\\nfunctionality. The field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based approach\\nsimulates the capsule's traversal through the strointestinal (GI) tract by\\ninjecting on-demand pre-recorded images from VCE studies. It is demonstrated\\nthat the HIL configuration is capable of meeting the real-time requirements of\\nthe prototypes and automatically identifying errors. The integration of machine\\nlearning (ML) hardware accelerators within medical devices can be facilitated\\nby utilising this configuration, as it enables the verification of its\\nfunctionality prior to the initiation of clinical testing.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T07:24:40Z\"}"}
