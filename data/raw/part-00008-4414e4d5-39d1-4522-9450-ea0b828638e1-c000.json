{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11933v1\", \"title\": \"Lifelong and Universal Machine Learning Potentials for Chemical Reaction\\n  Network Explorations\", \"summary\": \"Recent developments in computational chemistry facilitate the automated\\nquantum chemical exploration of chemical reaction networks for the in-silico\\nprediction of synthesis pathways, yield, and selectivity. However, the\\nunderlying quantum chemical energy calculations require vast computational\\nresources, limiting these explorations severely in practice. Machine learning\\npotentials (MLPs) offer a solution to increase computational efficiency, while\\nretaining the accuracy of reliable first-principles data used for their\\ntraining. Unfortunately, MLPs will be limited in their generalization ability\\nwithin chemical (reaction) space, if the underlying training data is not\\nrepresentative for a given application. Within the framework of automated\\nreaction network exploration, where new reactants or reagents composed of any\\nelements from the periodic table can be introduced, this lack of\\ngeneralizability will be the rule rather than the exception. Here, we therefore\\nstudy the benefits and drawbacks of two MLP concepts in this context. Whereas\\nuniversal MLPs are designed to cover most of the relevant chemical space in\\ntheir training, lifelong MLPs push their adaptability by efficient continual\\nlearning of additional data. While the accuracy of the universal MLPs turns out\\nto be not yet sufficient for reaction search trials without any fine-tuning,\\nlifelong MLPs can reach chemical accuracy. We propose an improved learning\\nalgorithm for lifelong adaptive data selection yielding efficient integration\\nof new data while previous expertise is preserved.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T10:12:08Z\"}"}
