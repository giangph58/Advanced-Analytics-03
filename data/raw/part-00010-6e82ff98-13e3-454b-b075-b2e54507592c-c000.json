It has recently been proposed that the\\nNavier-Stokes turbulence restores a hidden form of scale invariance in the\\ninertial interval when formulated for a dynamically (nonlinearly) rescaled\\nquasi-Lagrangian velocity field. Here we show that such hidden self-similarity\\nextends to the Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) approach in computational fluid\\ndynamics (CFD). In particular, we show that classical subgrid-scale models,\\nsuch as implicit or explicit Smagorinsky closures, respect the hidden scale\\ninvariance at all scales -- both resolved and subgrid. In the inertial range,\\nthey reproduce the hidden scale invariance of Navier-Stokes statistics. These\\nproperties are verified very accurately by numerical simulations and, beyond\\nCFD, turn LES into a valuable tool for fundamental turbulence research.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T13:21:02Z\"}"}
