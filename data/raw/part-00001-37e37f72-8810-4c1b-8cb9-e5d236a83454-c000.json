{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02555v1\", \"title\": \"Noise Calibration and Spatial-Frequency Interactive Network for STEM\\n  Image Enhancement\", \"summary\": \"Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) enables the observation of\\natomic arrangements at sub-angstrom resolution, allowing for atomically\\nresolved analysis of the physical and chemical properties of materials.\\nHowever, due to the effects of noise, electron beam damage, sample thickness,\\netc, obtaining satisfactory atomic-level images is often challenging. Enhancing\\nSTEM images can reveal clearer structural details of materials. Nonetheless,\\nexisting STEM image enhancement methods usually overlook unique features in the\\nfrequency domain, and existing datasets lack realism and generality. To resolve\\nthese issues, in this paper, we develop noise calibration, data synthesis, and\\nenhancement methods for STEM images. We first present a STEM noise calibration\\nmethod, which is used to synthesize more realistic STEM images. The parameters\\nof background noise, scan noise, and pointwise noise are obtained by\\nstatistical analysis and fitting of real STEM images containing atoms. Then we\\nuse these parameters to develop a more general dataset that considers both\\nregular and random atomic arrangements and includes both HAADF and BF mode\\nimages. Finally, we design a spatial-frequency interactive network for STEM\\nimage enhancement, which can explore the information in the frequency domain\\nformed by the periodicity of atomic arrangement. Experimental results show that\\nour data is closer to real STEM images and achieves better enhancement\\nperformances together with our network.
