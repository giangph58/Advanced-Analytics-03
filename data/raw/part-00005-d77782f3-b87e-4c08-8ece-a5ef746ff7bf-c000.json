{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20625v1\", \"title\": \"DiffusionRIR: Room Impulse Response Interpolation using Diffusion Models\", \"summary\": \"Room Impulse Responses (RIRs) characterize acoustic environments and are\\ncrucial in multiple audio signal processing tasks. High-quality RIR estimates\\ndrive applications such as virtual microphones, sound source localization,\\naugmented reality, and data augmentation. However, obtaining RIR measurements\\nwith high spatial resolution is resource-intensive, making it impractical for\\nlarge spaces or when dense sampling is required. This research addresses the\\nchallenge of estimating RIRs at unmeasured locations within a room using\\nDenoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM). Our method leverages the\\nanalogy between RIR matrices and image inpainting, transforming RIR data into a\\nformat suitable for diffusion-based reconstruction.\\n  Using simulated RIR data based on the image method, we demonstrate our\\napproach's effectiveness on microphone arrays of different curvatures, from\\nlinear to semi-circular. Our method successfully reconstructs missing RIRs,\\neven in large gaps between microphones. Under these conditions, it achieves\\naccurate reconstruction, significantly outperforming baseline Spline Cubic\\nInterpolation in terms of Normalized Mean Square Error and Cosine Distance\\nbetween actual and interpolated RIRs.\\n  This research highlights the potential of using generative models for\\neffective RIR interpolation, paving the way for generating additional data from\\nlimited real-world measurements.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SD\", \"categories\": \"cs.SD,cs.AI,eess.AS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T10:52:07Z\"}"}
