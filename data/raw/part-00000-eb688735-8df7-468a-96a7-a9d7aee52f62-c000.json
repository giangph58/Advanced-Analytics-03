{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14834v1\", \"title\": \"Output regulation for a reaction-diffusion system with input delay and\\n  unknown frequency\", \"summary\": \"This study solves the output regulation problem for a reaction-diffusion\\nsystem confronting concurrent input delay and fully unidentified disturbances\\n(encompassing both unknown frequencies and amplitudes) across all channels. The\\nprincipal innovation emerges from a novel adaptive control architecture that\\nsynergizes the modal decomposition technique with a dual-observer mechanism,\\nenabling real-time concurrent estimation of unmeasurable system states and\\ndisturbances through a state observer and an adaptive disturbance estimator.\\nUnlike existing approaches limited to either delay compensation or partial\\ndisturbance rejection, our methodology overcomes the technical barrier of\\ncoordinating these two requirements through a rigorously constructed\\ntracking-error-based controller, achieving exponential convergence of system\\noutput to reference signals. Numerical simulations are presented to validate\\nthe effectiveness of the proposed output feedback control strategy.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T03:29:09Z\"}"}
