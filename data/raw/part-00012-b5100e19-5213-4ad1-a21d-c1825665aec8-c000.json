The design and optimization of plasma-based accelerators\\ntypically require particle-in-cell simulations, which can be computationally\\nintensive and time consuming. In this study, we train a neural network model to\\nobtain the on-axis longitudinal electric field distribution directly without\\nconducting particle-in-cell simulations for designing a two-bunch plasma\\nwakefield acceleration stage. By combining the neural network model with an\\nadvanced algorithm for achieving the minimal energy spread, the optimal\\nnormalized charge per unit length of a trailing beam leading to the optimal\\nbeam-loading can be quickly identified. This approach can reduce computation\\ntime from around 7.6 minutes in the case of using particle-in-cell simulations\\nto under 0.1 seconds. Moreover, the longitudinal electric field distribution\\nunder the optimal beam-loading can be visually observed. Utilizing this model\\nwith the beam current profile also enables the direct extraction of design\\nparameters under the optimal beam-loading, including the maximum decelerating\\nelectric field within the drive beam, the average accelerating electric field\\nwithin the trailing beam and the transformer ratio. This model has the\\npotential to significantly improve the efficiency of designing and optimizing\\nthe beam-driven plasma wakefield accelerators.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:40:41Z\"}"}
