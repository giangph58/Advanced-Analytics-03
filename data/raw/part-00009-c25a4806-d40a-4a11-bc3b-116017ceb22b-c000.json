{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12198v1\", \"title\": \"Diagrammatic Simplification of Linearized Coupled Cluster Theory\", \"summary\": \"Linearized Coupled Cluster Doubles (LinCCD) often provides near-singular\\nenergies in small-gap systems that exhibit static correlation. This has been\\nattributed to the lack of quadratic $T_2^2$ terms that typically balance out\\nsmall energy denominators in the CCD amplitude equations. Herein, I show that\\nexchange contributions to ring and crossed-ring contractions (not small\\ndenominators per se) cause the divergent behavior of LinCC(S)D approaches.\\nRather than omitting exchange terms, I recommend a regular and size-consistent\\nmethod that retains only linear ladder diagrams. As LinCCD and configuration\\ninteraction doubles (CID) equations are isomorphic, this also implies that\\nsimplification (rather than quadratic extensions) of CID amplitude equations\\ncan lead to a size-consistent theory. Linearized ladder CCD (LinLCCD) is robust\\nin statically-correlated systems and can be made\\n$O(n_{\\\\text{occ}}^4n_{\\\\text{vir}}^2)$ with a hole-hole approximation. The\\nrelationship between LinLCCD and random-phase approximation sets the stage for\\nthe development of next-generation double-hybrid density functionals that can\\ndescribe static correlation.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T15:48:33Z\"}"}
