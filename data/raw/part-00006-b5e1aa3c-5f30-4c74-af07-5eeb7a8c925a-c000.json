We find substantial time\\nsavings on common core tasks across a wide range of industries and occupations:\\nworkers who make use of this technology spent half an hour less reading email\\neach week and completed documents 12% faster. Despite the newness of the\\ntechnology, nearly 40% of workers who were given access to the tool used it\\nregularly in their work throughout the 6-month study.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,cs.LG,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T17:55:32Z\"}"}
