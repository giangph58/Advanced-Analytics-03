Instead of using practical system state,\\nin this paper, the desired approximation approach is characterized to tackle\\nsuch a problem, where the desired state signal is required only as the input to\\nthe network. An integral Lyapunov function-based adaptive controller is\\ndesigned, in the sense of the error tracking, where the treatment of the\\nstate-dependent input gain is adopted. Theoretical results for the performance\\nanalysis of the integral and incremental adaptation algorithms are presented in\\ndetails. In particular, the boundedness of the variables in the closed-loop is\\ncharacterized, while the transient performance of the output error is\\nanalytically quantified. It is shown that the proposed control schemes assure\\nthat the tracking error converges to an adjustable set without any requirement\\non the knowledge of the region that the practical variables evolve, and remove\\nthe requirement for the setting of initial conditions including system states\\nand weight estimates.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T11:16:07Z\"}"}
