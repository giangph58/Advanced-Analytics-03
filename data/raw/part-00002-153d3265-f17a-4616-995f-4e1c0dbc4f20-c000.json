The Digital Services Act Transparency Database offers an unprecedented\\nopportunity to systematically study content moderation at scale, enabling\\nresearchers and policymakers to assess platforms' compliance and effectiveness.\\nHerein, we analyze 1.58 billion self-reported moderation actions taken by eight\\nlarge social media platforms during an extended period of eight months\\nsurrounding the 2024 European Parliament elections. Our findings reveal a lack\\nof adaptation in moderation strategies, as platforms did not exhibit\\nsignificant changes in their enforcement behaviors surrounding the elections.\\nThis raises concerns about whether platforms adapted their moderation practices\\nat all, or if structural limitations of the database concealed possible\\nadjustments. Moreover, we found that noted transparency and accountability\\nissues persist nearly a year after initial concerns were raised. These results\\nhighlight the limitations of current self-regulatory approaches and underscore\\nthe need for stronger enforcement and data access mechanisms to ensure that\\nonline platforms uphold their responsibility in safeguarding democratic\\nprocesses.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY,cs.ET,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T15:31:01Z\"}"}
