{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04851v1\", \"title\": \"Nonlinear Phase Gates as Airy Transforms of the Wigner Function\", \"summary\": \"Low-order nonlinear phase gates allow the construction of versatile\\nhigher-order nonlinearities for bosonic systems and grant access to continuous\\nvariable quantum simulations of many unexplored aspects of nonlinear quantum\\ndynamics. The resulting nonlinear transformations produce, even with small\\nstrength, multiple regions of negativity in the Wigner function and thus show\\nan immediate departure from classical phase space. Towards the development of\\nrealistic, bounded versions of these gates we show that the action of a\\nquartic-bounded cubic gate on an arbitrary multimode quantum state in phase\\nspace can be understood as an Airy transform of the Wigner function. This\\ntoolbox generalises the symplectic transformations associated with Gaussian\\noperations and allows for the practical calculation, analysis and\\ninterpretation of explicit Wigner functions and the quantum non-Gaussian\\nphenomena resulting from bounded nonlinear potentials.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T09:07:56Z\"}"}
