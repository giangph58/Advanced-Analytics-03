{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16441v1\", \"title\": \"SoCov: Semi-Orthogonal Parametric Pooling of Covariance Matrix for\\n  Speaker Recognition\", \"summary\": \"In conventional deep speaker embedding frameworks, the pooling layer\\naggregates all frame-level features over time and computes their mean and\\nstandard deviation statistics as inputs to subsequent segment-level layers.\\nSuch statistics pooling strategy produces fixed-length representations from\\nvariable-length speech segments. However, this method treats different\\nframe-level features equally and discards covariance information. In this\\npaper, we propose the Semi-orthogonal parameter pooling of Covariance matrix\\n(SoCov) method. The SoCov pooling computes the covariance matrix from the\\nself-attentive frame-level features and compresses it into a vector using the\\nsemi-orthogonal parametric vectorization, which is then concatenated with the\\nweighted standard deviation vector to form inputs to the segment-level layers.\\nDeep embedding based on SoCov is called ``sc-vector''. The proposed sc-vector\\nis compared to several different baselines on the SRE21 development and\\nevaluation sets. The sc-vector system significantly outperforms the\\nconventional x-vector system, with a relative reduction in EER of 15.5% on\\nSRE21Eval. When using self-attentive deep feature, SoCov helps to reduce EER on\\nSRE21Eval by about 30.9% relatively to the conventional ``mean + standard\\ndeviation'' statistics.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.AS\", \"categories\": \"eess.AS,cs.SD\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T06:01:14Z\"}"}
