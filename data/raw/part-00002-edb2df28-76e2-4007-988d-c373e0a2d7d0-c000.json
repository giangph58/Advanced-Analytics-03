We developed a multi-modal artificial\\nintelligence system integrating FFDM, synthetic mammography, and DBT to provide\\nbreast-level predictions and bounding-box localizations of suspicious findings.\\nOur AI system, trained on approximately 500,000 mammography exams, achieved\\n0.945 AUROC on an internal test set. It demonstrated capacity to reduce recalls\\nby 31.7% and radiologist workload by 43.8% while maintaining 100% sensitivity,\\nunderscoring its potential to improve clinical workflows. External validation\\nconfirmed strong generalizability, reducing the gap to a perfect AUROC by\\n35.31%-69.14% relative to strong baselines. In prospective deployment across 18\\nsites, the system reduced recall rates for low-risk cases. An improved version,\\ntrained on over 750,000 exams with additional labels, further reduced the gap\\nby 18.86%-56.62% across large external datasets. Overall, these results\\nunderscore the importance of utilizing all available imaging modalities,\\ndemonstrate the potential for clinical impact, and indicate feasibility of\\nfurther reduction of the test error with increased training set when using\\nlarge-capacity neural networks.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T03:29:40Z\"}"}
