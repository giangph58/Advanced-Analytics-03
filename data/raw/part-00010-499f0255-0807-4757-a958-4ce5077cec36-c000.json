Recently, magnetic octupoles have been proposed as\\nthe order parameters of time-reversal-symmetry breaking centrosymmetric\\nantiferromagnets exhibiting nonrelativistic spin splitting, which is referred\\nto as ``altermagnet''. However, a gauge-invariant formulation of magnetic\\noctupoles in crystalline solids remains elusive. Here, we present a\\ngauge-invariant expression of spin magnetic octupoles in periodic crystals\\nbased on quantum mechanics and thermodynamics. Our expression reveals a\\ncontribution from an anisotropic magnetic dipole, which has the same symmetry\\nas conventional spin and orbital magnetic dipoles but carries no net\\nmagnetization. We demonstrate that such an anisotropic magnetic dipole acts as\\nan order parameter for antiferromagnets that exhibit the anomalous Hall effect.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T08:40:38Z\"}"}
