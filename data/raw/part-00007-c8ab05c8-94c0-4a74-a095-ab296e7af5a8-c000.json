We first show that the\\n(non-Markovian) allele-frequency process converges to a Markovian diffusion\\nprocess with jumps in a suitable relaxation of the Skorokhod J1 topology.\\nBackward in time we find that genealogies of samples of individuals are\\ndescribed by multi-type $\\\\Xi$-coalescents presenting multiple simultaneous\\nmergers with simultaneous migrations. These coalescents are also moment-duals\\nof the limiting jump diffusions. We then show through a numerical study that\\nour model is flexible and can predict various shapes for the site frequency\\nspectrum, consistent with real data, using a small number of interpretable\\nparameters.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,q-bio.PE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T08:57:35Z\"}"}
