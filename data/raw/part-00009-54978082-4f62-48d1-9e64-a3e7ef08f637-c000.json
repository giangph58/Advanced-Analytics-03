While being\\npurely name-passing, it allows the representation of higher-order functions and\\nstore. We study how $\\\\pi$-calculus processes can be controlled so that\\ncomputations can only involve storage of first-order values. The discipline is\\nenforced by a type system that is based on the notion of visibility, coming\\nfrom game semantics. We discuss the impact of visibility on the behavioural\\ntheory. We propose characterisations of may-testing and barbed equivalence,\\nbased on (variants of) trace equivalence and labelled bisimilarity, in the case\\nwhere computation is sequential, and in the case where computation is\\nwell-bracketed.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LO\", \"categories\": \"cs.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T08:11:02Z\"}"}
