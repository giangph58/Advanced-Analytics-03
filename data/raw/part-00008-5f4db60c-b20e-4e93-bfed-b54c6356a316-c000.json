While classical digital approaches remain the\\nstandard, quantum computing promises a breakthrough by enabling a more\\nefficient encoding of large-scale simulations with a limited number of qubits.\\n  This work presents a practical numerical assessment of a hybrid\\nquantum-classical approach to CFD based on the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM).\\nThe inherently non-linear LBM equations are linearized via a Carleman expansion\\nand solved using the quantum Harrow Hassidim Lloyd algorithm (HHL). We evaluate\\nthis method on three benchmark cases featuring different boundary conditions,\\nperiodic, bounceback, and moving wall, using statevector emulation on\\nhigh-performance computing resources.\\n  Our results confirm the validity of the approach, achieving median error\\nfidelities on the order of $10^{-3}$ and success probabilities sufficient for\\npractical quantum state sampling. Notably, the spectral properties of small\\nlattice systems closely approximate those of larger ones, suggesting a pathway\\nto mitigate one of HHL's bottlenecks: eigenvalue pre-evaluation.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.comp-ph,physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T15:41:48Z\"}"}
