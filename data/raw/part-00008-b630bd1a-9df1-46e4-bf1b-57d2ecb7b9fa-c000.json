Bayesian methods are well-suited for this\\npurpose, as they enable the synthesis of prior information through the use of\\nprior distributions. While the operating characteristics of Bayesian approaches\\nfor borrowing data from control arms have been extensively studied, methods\\nthat borrow treatment effects -- quantities derived from the comparison between\\ntwo arms -- remain less well understood. In this paper, we present the findings\\nof an extensive simulation study designed to address this gap. We evaluate the\\nfrequentist operating characteristics of these methods, including the\\nprobability of success, mean squared error, bias, precision, and credible\\ninterval coverage. Our results provide insights into the strengths and\\nlimitations of existing methods in the context of confirmatory trials. In\\nparticular, we show that the Conditional Power Prior and the Robust Mixture\\nPrior perform better overall, while the test-then-pool variants and the\\np-value-based power prior display suboptimal performance.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T17:55:11Z\"}"}
