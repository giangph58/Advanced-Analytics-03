{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03599v1\", \"title\": \"From Pixels to Polygons: A Survey of Deep Learning Approaches for\\n  Medical Image-to-Mesh Reconstruction\", \"summary\": \"Deep learning-based medical image-to-mesh reconstruction has rapidly evolved,\\nenabling the transformation of medical imaging data into three-dimensional mesh\\nmodels that are critical in computational medicine and in silico trials for\\nadvancing our understanding of disease mechanisms, and diagnostic and\\ntherapeutic techniques in modern medicine. This survey systematically\\ncategorizes existing approaches into four main categories: template models,\\nstatistical models, generative models, and implicit models. Each category is\\nanalysed in detail, examining their methodological foundations, strengths,\\nlimitations, and applicability to different anatomical structures and imaging\\nmodalities. We provide an extensive evaluation of these methods across various\\nanatomical applications, from cardiac imaging to neurological studies,\\nsupported by quantitative comparisons using standard metrics. Additionally, we\\ncompile and analyze major public datasets available for medical mesh\\nreconstruction tasks and discuss commonly used evaluation metrics and loss\\nfunctions. The survey identifies current challenges in the field, including\\nrequirements for topological correctness, geometric accuracy, and\\nmulti-modality integration. Finally, we present promising future research\\ndirections in this domain. This systematic review aims to serve as a\\ncomprehensive reference for researchers and practitioners in medical image\\nanalysis and computational medicine.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:01:43Z\"}"}
