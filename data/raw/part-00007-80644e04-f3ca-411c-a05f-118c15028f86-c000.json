In this paper, we\\ninvestigate CLIP's ability to extract high-level semantic and stylistic\\ninformation from paintings, including both human-created and AI-generated\\nimagery. We evaluate its perception across multiple dimensions: content, scene\\nunderstanding, artistic style, historical period, and the presence of visual\\ndeformations or artifacts. By designing targeted probing tasks and comparing\\nCLIP's responses to human annotations and expert benchmarks, we explore its\\nalignment with human perceptual and contextual understanding. Our findings\\nreveal both strengths and limitations in CLIP's visual representations,\\nparticularly in relation to aesthetic cues and artistic intent. We further\\ndiscuss the implications of these insights for using CLIP as a guidance\\nmechanism during generative processes, such as style transfer or prompt-based\\nimage synthesis. Our work highlights the need for deeper interpretability in\\nmultimodal systems, especially when applied to creative domains where nuance\\nand subjectivity play a central role.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.MM\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:21:10Z\"}"}
