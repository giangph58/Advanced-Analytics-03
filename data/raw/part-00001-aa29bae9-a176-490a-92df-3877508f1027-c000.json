Diverse use cases from industry consortium members are the\\nstarting point of a benchmarking workflow, that builds on the open-source\\nplatform QUARK, encompassing the full quantum software stack from the hardware\\nprovider interface to the application layer. By identifying and evaluating key\\nmetrics across the entire pipeline, we aim to uncover meaningful trends,\\nprovide systematic guidance on quantum utility, and distinguish promising\\nresearch directions from less viable approaches. Ultimately, this initiative\\ncontributes to the broader effort of establishing reliable benchmarking\\nstandards that drive the transition from experimental demonstrations to\\npractical quantum advantage.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:05:11Z\"}"}
