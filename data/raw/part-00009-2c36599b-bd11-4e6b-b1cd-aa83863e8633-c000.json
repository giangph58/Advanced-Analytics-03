{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04442v1\", \"title\": \"Consistent Field Theory Across the Mott-Insulator to Superfluid\\n  Transition\", \"summary\": \"We employ a field-theoretical approach to analyze the Bose-Hubbard model on a\\nlattice, with a focus on the low-energy properties across the Mott insulator\\n(MI) to superfluid (SF) transition. Prior approaches approximated the partition\\nfunction using cumulant expansions around the MI ground state, which, while\\naccurate in the MI phase, lead to inaccuracies in the SF phase where the MI\\nstate is a false ground state. By expanding around the correct mean-field\\nvacuum, we derive the effective field theory (EFT) governing the MI to SF\\ntransition. Through this, we reveal the underlying structure of the EFT\\ngoverning the nucleation of low-energy excitations, particularly the massless\\nand lowest massive modes, offering new insights into their emergence.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas,cond-mat.other\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:14:14Z\"}"}
