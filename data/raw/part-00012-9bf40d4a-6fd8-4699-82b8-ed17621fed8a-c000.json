As part\\nof the roadmap for the development of the high-tech field of quantum computing\\nin the period from 2020 to 2024, a set of software solutions for quantum\\ncomputing devices was developed. This software package includes a set of\\nquantum algorithms for solving prototypes of applied tasks, monitoring and\\nbenchmarking tools for quantum processors, error suppression and correction\\nmethods, tools for compiling and optimizing quantum circuits, as well as\\ninterfaces for remote cloud access. This review presents the key results\\nachieved, among which it is necessary to mention the execution of quantum\\nalgorithms using a cloud-based quantum computing platform.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T09:43:08Z\"}"}
