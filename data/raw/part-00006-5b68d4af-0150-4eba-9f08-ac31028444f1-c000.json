We consider the rendezvous problem on the\\ninfinite labeled line, with $2$ initially asleep agents, without communication,\\nand a synchronous notion of time. Nodes are labeled with unique positive\\nintegers. The initial distance between the two agents is denoted by $D$. Time\\nis divided into rounds. We count time from when an agent first wakes up, and\\ndenote by $\\\\tau$ the delay between the agents' wake up times. If awake in a\\ngiven round $T$, an agent has three options: stay at its current node $v$, take\\nport $0$, or take port $1$. If it decides to stay, the agent is still at node\\n$v$ in round $T+1$. Otherwise, it is at one of the two neighbors of $v$ on the\\nline, based on the port it chose. The agents achieve rendezvous in $T$ rounds\\nif they are at the same node in round $T$. We aim for a deterministic algorithm\\nfor this task.\\n  The problem was recently considered by Miller and Pelc [DISC 2023]. With\\n$\\\\ell_{\\\\max}$ the largest label of the two starting nodes, they showed that no\\nalgorithm can guarantee rendezvous in $o(D \\\\log^* \\\\ell_{\\\\max})$ rounds. The\\nlower bound follows from a connection with the LOCAL model of distributed\\ncomputing, and holds even if the agents are guaranteed simultaneous wake-up\\n($\\\\tau = 0$) and are given $D$ as advice. Miller and Pelc also gave an\\nalgorithm of optimal matching complexity $O(D \\\\log^* \\\\ell_{\\\\max})$ when $D$ is\\nknown to the agents, but only obtained the higher bound of $O(D^2 (\\\\log^*\\n\\\\ell_{\\\\max})^3)$ when $D$ is unknown.\\n  We improve this second complexity to a tight $O(D \\\\log^* \\\\ell_{\\\\max})$. In\\nfact, our algorithm achieves rendezvous in $O(D \\\\log^* \\\\ell_{\\\\min})$ rounds,\\nwhere $\\\\ell_{\\\\min}$ is the smallest label within distance $O(D)$ of the two\\nstarting positions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC,cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T16:56:52Z\"}"}
