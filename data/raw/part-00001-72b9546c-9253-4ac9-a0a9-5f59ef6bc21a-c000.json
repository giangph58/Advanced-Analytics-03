A pair of lossy channels\\nconnects a sender with both a (legitimate) receiver and an eavesdropper. The\\nsender and receiver have only partial information about the actual state of the\\nchannels. In this situation, their task is to transmit the maximum amount of\\nmessages over an asymptotically large number of uses of their channel while\\nguaranteeing at the same time that only an (asymptotically) negligible amount\\nof information leaks to the eavesdropper. We prove capacity formulas for the\\ncase where both sender and receiver have the same information about the system\\nand for the case where the sender has channel state information.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T15:43:18Z\"}"}
