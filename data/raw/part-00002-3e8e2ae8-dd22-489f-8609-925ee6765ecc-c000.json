{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21821v1\", \"title\": \"Local Weak Degeneracy of Planar Graphs\", \"summary\": \"Thomassen showed that planar graphs are 5-list-colourable, and that planar\\ngraphs of girth at least five are 3-list-colourable. An easy degeneracy\\nargument shows that planar graphs of girth at least four are 4-list-colourable.\\nIn 2022, Postle and Smith-Roberge proved a common strengthening of these three\\nresults: with $g(v)$ denoting the length of a shortest cycle containing a\\nvertex $v$, they showed that if $G$ is a planar graph and $L$ a list assignment\\nfor $G$ where $|L(v)| \\\\geq \\\\max\\\\{3,8-g(v)\\\\}$ for all $v \\\\in V(G)$, then $G$ is\\n$L$-colourable. Moreover, they conjectured that an analogous theorem should\\nhold for correspondence colouring. We prove this conjecture; in fact, our main\\ntheorem holds in the still more restrictive setting of weak degeneracy, and\\nmoreover acts as a joint strengthening of the fact that planar graphs are\\nweakly 4-degenerate (originally due to Bernshteyn, Lee, and Smith-Roberge), and\\nthat planar graphs of girth at least five are weakly 2-degenerate (originally\\ndue to Han et al.).\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:26:36Z\"}"}
