This paper introduces a parametric channel estimation\\ntechnique based on Bayesian estimation. This technique uses the estimated\\nchannel parameters to parameterize the well-known LMMSE channel estimator. We\\nfirst derive an asymptotic CME formulation that holds for a wide range of\\npriors on the channel parameters. Based on this, we show that parametric\\nBayesian channel estimation is MSE-optimal for high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\\nand/or long coherence intervals, i.e., many noisy observations provided within\\none coherence interval. Numerical simulations validate the derived\\nformulations.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T13:41:02Z\"}"}
