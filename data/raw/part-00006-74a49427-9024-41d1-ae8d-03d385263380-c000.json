{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16538v1\", \"title\": \"Streetscape Analysis with Generative AI (SAGAI): Vision-Language\\n  Assessment and Mapping of Urban Scenes\", \"summary\": \"Streetscapes are an essential component of urban space. Their assessment is\\npresently either limited to morphometric properties of their mass skeleton or\\nrequires labor-intensive qualitative evaluations of visually perceived\\nqualities. This paper introduces SAGAI: Streetscape Analysis with Generative\\nArtificial Intelligence, a modular workflow for scoring street-level urban\\nscenes using open-access data and vision-language models. SAGAI integrates\\nOpenStreetMap geometries, Google Street View imagery, and a lightweight version\\nof the LLaVA model to generate structured spatial indicators from images via\\ncustomizable natural language prompts. The pipeline includes an automated\\nmapping module that aggregates visual scores at both the point and street\\nlevels, enabling direct cartographic interpretation. It operates without\\ntask-specific training or proprietary software dependencies, supporting\\nscalable and interpretable analysis of urban environments. Two exploratory case\\nstudies in Nice and Vienna illustrate SAGAI's capacity to produce geospatial\\noutputs from vision-language inference. The initial results show strong\\nperformance for binary urban-rural scene classification, moderate precision in\\ncommercial feature detection, and lower estimates, but still informative, of\\nsidewalk width. Fully deployable by any user, SAGAI can be easily adapted to a\\nwide range of urban research themes, such as walkability, safety, or urban\\ndesign, through prompt modification alone.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T09:08:06Z\"}"}
