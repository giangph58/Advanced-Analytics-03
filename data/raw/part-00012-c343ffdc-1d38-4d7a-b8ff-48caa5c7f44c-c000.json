The data was obtained on a Large Phased Array (LPA) at a frequency of\\n111 MHz. The periodograms calculated using the Fast Folding Algorithm (FFA)\\nwere used for the search. To increase the sensitivity, the periodograms\\nobtained in different observation sessions were added together. Of the 14 known\\npulsars that entered the study area, with periods of P>2 s and dispersion\\nmeasures (DM) less than 200 pc/cm$^3$, 9 were detected. 2 new pulsars have been\\nfound. The mean profiles of pulsars are obtained and estimates of their flux\\ndensities are given. The open pulsar J1951+28, with a period of P = 7.3342 s\\nand DM = 3.5 pc/cm$^3$, turned out to be one of the pulsars closest to the Sun.\\nThe absence of new pulsars with periods of tens of seconds with a search\\nsensitivity of 1 mJy outside the Galactic plane indicates a low probability of\\nthe existence of pulsars with extremely long periods. Most likely, the recently\\nfound sources of periodic radiation with periods from a minute to tens of\\nminutes are white dwarfs.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T13:53:41Z\"}"}
