{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03429v1\", \"title\": \"Joyce structures and poles of Painlev\\u00e9 equations\", \"summary\": \"Joyce structures are a class of geometric structures that first arose in\\nrelation to Donaldson-Thomas theory. There is a special class of examples,\\ncalled class $S[A_1]$, whose underlying manifold parameterises Riemann surfaces\\nof some fixed genus equipped with a meromorphic quadratic differential with\\npoles of fixed orders. We study two Joyce structures of this type using the\\nisomonodromic systems associated to the Painlev\\\\'e II and III$_3$ equations. We\\ngive explicit formulae for the Pleba\\\\'nski functions of these Joyce structures,\\nand compute several associated objects, including their tau functions, which we\\nexplicitly relate to the corresponding Painlev\\\\'e tau functions. We show that\\nthe behaviour of the Joyce structure near the zero-section can be studied\\nanalytically through poles of Painlev\\\\'e equations. The systematic treatment\\ngives a blueprint for the study of more general Joyce structures associated to\\nmeromorphic quadratic differentials on the Riemann sphere.\", \"main_category\": \"math-ph\", \"categories\": \"math-ph,hep-th,math.MP,nlin.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T11:14:54Z\"}"}
