{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11027v1\", \"title\": \"From Heteropolymer Stiffness Distributions to Effective Homopolymers: A\\n  Conformational Analysis of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins\", \"summary\": \"Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are characterized by a lack of\\ndefined secondary and tertiary structures, and are thus well-suited for\\ndescriptions within polymer theory. However, the intrinsic heterogeneity of\\nproteins, stemming from their diverse amino acid building blocks, introduces\\nlocal variations in chain stiffness, which can impact conformational behavior\\nat larger scales. To investigate this effect, we developed a heterogeneous\\nworm-like chain model in which the local persistence length follows a Gaussian\\ndistribution. We demonstrate that these heterogeneous chains can be effectively\\nmapped to homogeneous chains with a single effective persistence length. To\\nassess whether this mapping can be extended to naturally occurring IDPs, we\\nperformed simulations using various coarse-grained IDP models, finding that the\\nsimulated IDPs have similar shapes like the corresponding homogeneous and\\nheterogeneous worm-like chains. However, the IDPs are systematically larger\\nthan ideal worm-like chains, yet slightly more compact when excluded volume\\ninteractions are considered. We attribute these differences to intramolecular\\ninteractions between non-bonded monomers, which our theoretical models do not\\naccount for.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T09:50:28Z\"}"}
