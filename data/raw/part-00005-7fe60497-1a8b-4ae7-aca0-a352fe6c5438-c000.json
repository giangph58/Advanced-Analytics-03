So that only easy images are selected\\nfor training when the model has poor fitting ability at the initial stage, and\\ngradually expand to more difficult images, the strategy includes a difficulty\\nevaluation strategy based on the teacher model and an knee point-based training\\nscheduling strategy. Firstly, multiple teacher models are trained, and the\\nconsistency of the quality of steganographic images under multiple teacher\\nmodels is used as the difficulty score to construct the training subsets from\\neasy to difficult. Secondly, a training control strategy based on knee points\\nis proposed to reduce the possibility of overfitting on small training sets and\\naccelerate the training process. Experimental results on three large public\\ndatasets, ALASKA2, VOC2012 and ImageNet, show that the proposed image\\nsteganography scheme is able to improve the model performance under multiple\\nalgorithmic frameworks, which not only has a high PSNR, SSIM score, and\\ndecoding accuracy, but also the steganographic images generated by the model\\nunder the training of the STCL strategy have a low steganography analysis\\nscores.
