Given a finite graph $G = (V, E)$ and a family of admissible sets\\n$\\\\{\\\\mathsf P_v \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{Z} : v \\\\in V\\\\}$, let $\\\\mathcal N (G; \\\\prod_{v\\n\\\\in V} \\\\mathsf P_v)$ denote the number of orientations in which the out-degree\\nof each vertex $v$ lies in $P_v$. We prove a general duality formula expressing\\n$\\\\mathcal N(G; \\\\prod_{v \\\\in V} \\\\mathsf P_v)$ as a signed sum over edge subsets,\\ninvolving products of coefficient sums associated with $\\\\{\\\\mathsf P_v\\\\}_{v \\\\in\\nV}$, from a family of polynomials. Our approach employs gauge transformations,\\na technique rooted in statistical physics and holographic algorithms. We also\\npresent a probabilistic derivation of the same identity, interpreting the\\norientation-generating polynomial as the expectation of a random polynomial\\nproduct. As applications, we obtain explicit formulas for the number of even\\norientations and for mixed Eulerian-even orientations on general graphs. Our\\nformula generalizes a result of Borb\\\\'enyi and Csikv\\\\'ari on Eulerian\\norientations of graphs.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T06:40:50Z\"}"}
