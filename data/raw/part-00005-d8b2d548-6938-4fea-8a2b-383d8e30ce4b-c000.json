Implementing feedback\\nis especially challenging when the required delay should match the time scales\\nof silicon's nonlinearities. To increase the computation speed and preclude any\\nneed for very long delay lines, we avoid relying on silicon's nonlinearity and\\nmerely employ either amplitude or phase modulation along with direct detection.\\nBy supplementing its memory with that of the electronic output layer, the\\nproposed photonic reservoir composed of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer and a\\nmicroring resonator is predicted to perform computations one order of magnitude\\nfaster than those based on silicon's nonlinearity with its speed only limited\\nby the modulation/detection bandwidth. This reservoir performs accurately in\\nNARMA-10, Mackey-Glass, and Santa-Fe prediction tasks, and enables signal\\nequalization in optical communication systems.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T05:13:08Z\"}"}
