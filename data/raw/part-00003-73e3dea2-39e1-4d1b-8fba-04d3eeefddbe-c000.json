{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07961v1\", \"title\": \"Geo4D: Leveraging Video Generators for Geometric 4D Scene Reconstruction\", \"summary\": \"We introduce Geo4D, a method to repurpose video diffusion models for\\nmonocular 3D reconstruction of dynamic scenes. By leveraging the strong dynamic\\nprior captured by such video models, Geo4D can be trained using only synthetic\\ndata while generalizing well to real data in a zero-shot manner. Geo4D predicts\\nseveral complementary geometric modalities, namely point, depth, and ray maps.\\nIt uses a new multi-modal alignment algorithm to align and fuse these\\nmodalities, as well as multiple sliding windows, at inference time, thus\\nobtaining robust and accurate 4D reconstruction of long videos. Extensive\\nexperiments across multiple benchmarks show that Geo4D significantly surpasses\\nstate-of-the-art video depth estimation methods, including recent methods such\\nas MonST3R, which are also designed to handle dynamic scenes.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,I.4.5\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:59:55Z\"}"}
