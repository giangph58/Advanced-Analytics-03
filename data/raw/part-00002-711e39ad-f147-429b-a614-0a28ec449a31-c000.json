{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17531v1\", \"title\": \"Towards Machine-Generated Code for the Resolution of User Intentions\", \"summary\": \"The growing capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large\\nLanguage Models (LLMs), prompt a reassessment of the interaction mechanisms\\nbetween users and their devices. Currently, users are required to use a set of\\nhigh-level applications to achieve their desired results. However, the advent\\nof AI may signal a shift in this regard, as its capabilities have generated\\nnovel prospects for user-provided intent resolution through the deployment of\\nmodel-generated code, which is tantamount to the generation of workflows\\ncomprising a multitude of interdependent steps. This development represents a\\nsignificant progression in the realm of hybrid workflows, where human and\\nartificial intelligence collaborate to address user intentions, with the former\\nresponsible for defining these intentions and the latter for implementing the\\nsolutions to address them. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of\\ngenerating and executing workflows through code generation that results from\\nprompting an LLM with a concrete user intention, such as \\\\emph{Please send my\\ncar title to my insurance company}, and a simplified application programming\\ninterface for a GUI-less operating system. We provide in-depth analysis and\\ncomparison of various user intentions, the resulting code, and its execution.\\nThe findings demonstrate a general feasibility of our approach and that the\\nemployed LLM, GPT-4o-mini, exhibits remarkable proficiency in the generation of\\ncode-oriented workflows in accordance with provided user intentions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T13:19:17Z\"}"}
