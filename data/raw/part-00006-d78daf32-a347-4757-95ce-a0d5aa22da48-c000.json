These\\ndeformations are performed along internal isometries and lead to backgrounds\\nwith fully preserved or reduced supersymmetry. Using the formalism of\\n$G$-structures, we systematically characterise the resulting geometries and\\ntrack the evolution of their supersymmetric properties under the deformation.\\nIn particular, we identify transitions among SU(3), SU(2), and identity\\nstructures, and demonstrate the preservation of Killing spinors through\\nexplicit spinor bilinear constructions. Additionally, we investigate D-brane\\nembeddings in the deformed geometries, uncovering stable and supersymmetric\\nconfigurations supported by the new backgrounds. Our results offer new insights\\ninto the classification of AdS$_3$ flux vacua and provide a concrete framework\\nfor understanding their potential holographic duals.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:11:35Z\"}"}
