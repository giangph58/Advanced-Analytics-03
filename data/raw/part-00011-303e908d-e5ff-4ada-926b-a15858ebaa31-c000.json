We continue this evolution by combining\\ncentral insights from both theories to argue that physical limits on\\ninformation collection resulting from quantum gravity coupled with general\\ncovariance preclude the fixed information geometry still assumed in both\\ninformation theory and quantum mechanics. As a consequence there must be a\\ngravitized, generally covariant extension of both theories. We also propose a\\nnovel experimental test involving intrinsic triple and higher order quantum\\ninterferences that would provide evidence for dynamical information metrics and\\na dynamical Born rule.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T13:17:42Z\"}"}
