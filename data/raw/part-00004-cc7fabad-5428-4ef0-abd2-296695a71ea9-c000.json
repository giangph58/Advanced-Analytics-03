{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16923v1\", \"title\": \"Meta-Learning Online Dynamics Model Adaptation in Off-Road Autonomous\\n  Driving\", \"summary\": \"High-speed off-road autonomous driving presents unique challenges due to\\ncomplex, evolving terrain characteristics and the difficulty of accurately\\nmodeling terrain-vehicle interactions. While dynamics models used in\\nmodel-based control can be learned from real-world data, they often struggle to\\ngeneralize to unseen terrain, making real-time adaptation essential. We propose\\na novel framework that combines a Kalman filter-based online adaptation scheme\\nwith meta-learned parameters to address these challenges. Offline meta-learning\\noptimizes the basis functions along which adaptation occurs, as well as the\\nadaptation parameters, while online adaptation dynamically adjusts the onboard\\ndynamics model in real time for model-based control. We validate our approach\\nthrough extensive experiments, including real-world testing on a full-scale\\nautonomous off-road vehicle, demonstrating that our method outperforms baseline\\napproaches in prediction accuracy, performance, and safety metrics,\\nparticularly in safety-critical scenarios. Our results underscore the\\neffectiveness of meta-learned dynamics model adaptation, advancing the\\ndevelopment of reliable autonomous systems capable of navigating diverse and\\nunseen environments.
