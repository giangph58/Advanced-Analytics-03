Using a momentum-resolved Boltzmann equation approach for\\nelectron-phonon interaction, we solve for the combined effects of orientational\\nrelaxation, thermalization, and cooling. We introduce momentum orientational\\nrelaxation as the initial step in the equilibration of an optically excited\\nnon-equilibrium electron gas by highlighting its importance for the optical\\nresponse of noble metals and the dephasing of plasmonic excitations. Our\\nnumerical results for gold reveal that orientational relaxation exists\\nindependently of the absorbed optical energy and dominates on time scales on\\nthe first tens of fs after excitation. Incorporating also thermalization and\\ncooling on times up to a few ps, our approach provides a simultaneous\\ndescription of optical and thermal properties of noble metals under initial\\nnon-equilibrium conditions.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T12:45:39Z\"}"}
