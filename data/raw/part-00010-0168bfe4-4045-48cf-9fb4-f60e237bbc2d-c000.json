{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06046v1\", \"title\": \"Rhythmic neuromorphic control of a pendulum: A hybrid systems analysis\", \"summary\": \"Neuromorphic engineering is an emerging research domain that aims to realize\\nimportant implementation advantages that brain-inspired technologies can offer\\nover classical digital technologies, including energy efficiency, adaptability,\\nand robustness. For the field of systems and control, neuromorphic controllers\\ncould potentially bring many benefits, but their advancement is hampered by\\nlack of systematic analysis and design tools. In this paper, the objective is\\nto show that hybrid systems methods can aid in filling this gap. We do this by\\nformally analyzing rhythmic neuromorphic control of a pendulum system, which\\nwas recently proposed as a prototypical setup. The neuromorphic controller\\ngenerates spikes, which we model as a Dirac delta pulse, whenever the pendulum\\nangular position crosses its resting position, with the goal of inducing a\\nstable limit cycle. This leads to modeling the closed-loop system as a hybrid\\ndynamical system, which in between spikes evolves in open loop and where the\\njumps correspond to the spiking control actions. Exploiting the hybrid system\\nmodel, we formally prove the existence, uniqueness, and a stability property of\\nthe hybrid limit cycle for the closed-loop system. Numerical simulations\\nillustrate our approach. We finally elaborate on a possible spiking adaptation\\nmechanism on the pulse amplitude to generate a hybrid limit cycle of a desired\\nmaximal angular amplitude.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:46:03Z\"}"}
