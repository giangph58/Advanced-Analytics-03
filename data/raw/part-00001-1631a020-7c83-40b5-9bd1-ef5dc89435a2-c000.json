{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10851v1\", \"title\": \"ICAFS: Inter-Client-Aware Feature Selection for Vertical Federated\\n  Learning\", \"summary\": \"Vertical federated learning (VFL) enables a paradigm for vertically\\npartitioned data across clients to collaboratively train machine learning\\nmodels. Feature selection (FS) plays a crucial role in Vertical Federated\\nLearning (VFL) due to the unique nature that data are distributed across\\nmultiple clients. In VFL, different clients possess distinct subsets of\\nfeatures for overlapping data samples, making the process of identifying and\\nselecting the most relevant features a complex yet essential task. Previous FS\\nefforts have primarily revolved around intra-client feature selection,\\noverlooking vital feature interaction across clients, leading to subpar model\\noutcomes. We introduce ICAFS, a novel multi-stage ensemble approach for\\neffective FS in VFL by considering inter-client interactions. By employing\\nconditional feature synthesis alongside multiple learnable feature selectors,\\nICAFS facilitates ensemble FS over these selectors using synthetic embeddings.\\nThis method bypasses the limitations of private gradient sharing and allows for\\nmodel training using real data with refined embeddings. Experiments on multiple\\nreal-world datasets demonstrate that ICAFS surpasses current state-of-the-art\\nmethods in prediction accuracy.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T04:19:04Z\"}"}
