Combining autonomous, computerised systems with unpredictable real-world\\nconditions can have consequences ranging from poor performance to collisions\\nand damage. This paper proposes using coupled oscillators to create a drone\\nswarm that is decentralised and self organising. This allows for greater\\nflexibility and adaptiveness than a hard-coded swarm, with more resilience and\\nscalability than a centralised system. Our method allows for a variable number\\nof drones to spontaneously form a swarm and react to changing swarm conditions.\\nAdditionally, this method includes provisions to prevent communication\\ninterference between drones, and signal processing techniques to ensure a\\nsmooth and cohesive swarm.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY,nlin.AO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T10:35:08Z\"}"}
