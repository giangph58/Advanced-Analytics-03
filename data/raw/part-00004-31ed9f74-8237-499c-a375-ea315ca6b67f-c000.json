{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17596v1\", \"title\": \"Rescaling and unconstrained minimisation of convex quadratic maps\", \"summary\": \"We investigate the properties of a class of piecewise-fractional maps arising\\nfrom the introduction of an invariance under rescaling into convex quadratic\\nmaps. The subsequent maps are quasiconvex, and pseudoconvex on specific convex\\ncones; they can be optimised via exact line search along admissible directions,\\nand the iterates then inherit a bidimensional optimality property. We study the\\nminimisation of such relaxed maps via coordinate descents with gradient-based\\nrules, placing a special emphasis on coordinate directions verifying a\\nmaximum-alignment property in the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces related to\\nthe underlying positive-semidefinite matrices. In this setting, we illustrate\\nthat accounting for the optimal rescaling of the iterates can in certain\\nsituations substantially accelerate the unconstrained minimisation of convex\\nquadratic maps.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.NA,math.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:22:38Z\"}"}
