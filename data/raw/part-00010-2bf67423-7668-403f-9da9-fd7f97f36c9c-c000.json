By\\nleveraging PyTorch's autograd, optHIM seamlessly integrates function, gradient,\\nand Hessian information into flexible line-search and trust-region methods. We\\nevaluate eleven state-of-the-art variants on benchmark problems spanning convex\\nand non-convex landscapes. Through a suite of quantitative metrics and\\nqualitative analyses, we demonstrate each method's strengths and trade-offs.\\noptHIM aims to democratize advanced optimization by providing a transparent,\\nextensible, and efficient framework for research and education.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MS\", \"categories\": \"cs.MS,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T05:24:14Z\"}"}
