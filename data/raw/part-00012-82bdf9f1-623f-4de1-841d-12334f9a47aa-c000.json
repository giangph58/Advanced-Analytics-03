Moreover, the\\ntarget value of the control parameter may occur outside the experimentally\\naccessible range. The indicated target state, however, can still be reached\\nwithin a clever protocol of temporal changes of the control parameter provided\\nits decomposition into some basis is known. It turns out that such a protocol\\ncan be obtained in the framework of the optimal control theory. In this paper,\\nwe show how to apply such an optimization scheme to small quantum systems\\ntreating interaction strength as the control parameter. We believe that the\\nproposed approach can be creatively extended to various complex quantum\\nsystems.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T16:37:49Z\"}"}
