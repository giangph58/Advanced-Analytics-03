{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11306v1\", \"title\": \"Context-Aware Palmprint Recognition via a Relative Similarity Metric\", \"summary\": \"We propose a new approach to matching mechanism for palmprint recognition by\\nintroducing a Relative Similarity Metric (RSM) that enhances the robustness and\\ndiscriminability of existing matching frameworks. While conventional systems\\nrely on direct pairwise similarity measures, such as cosine or Euclidean\\ndistances, these metrics fail to capture how a pairwise similarity compares\\nwithin the context of the entire dataset. Our method addresses this by\\nevaluating the relative consistency of similarity scores across up to all\\nidentities, allowing for better suppression of false positives and negatives.\\nApplied atop the CCNet architecture, our method achieves a new state-of-the-art\\n0.000036% Equal Error Rate (EER) on the Tongji dataset, outperforming previous\\nmethods and demonstrating the efficacy of incorporating relational structure\\ninto the palmprint matching process.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:46:17Z\"}"}
