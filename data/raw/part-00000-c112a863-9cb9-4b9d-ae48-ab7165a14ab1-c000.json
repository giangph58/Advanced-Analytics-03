This work investigates how different detector properties\\nimpact jet flavor identification and their subsequent effects on high-profile\\nphysics analyses. Using Higgs boson coupling measurements and searches for\\ninvisible Higgs decays as benchmarks, we systematically evaluate the\\nsensitivity of these analyses to tracker and calorimeter detector\\nconfigurations. We examine variations in single-point resolution, material\\nbudget, silicon layer placement, and particle identification capabilities,\\nquantifying their effects on flavor-tagging performance. Additionally, we\\npresent the first comprehensive study of Higgs-to-invisible decay detection\\nusing full detector simulation, providing important insights for optimizing\\nfuture detector designs at lepton colliders.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T11:51:47Z\"}"}
