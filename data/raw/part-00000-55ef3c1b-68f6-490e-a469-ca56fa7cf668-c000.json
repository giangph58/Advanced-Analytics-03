We establish that the\\nFujita exponent, a critical threshold that delimits different dynamical regimes\\nof this equation, is $$p_F\\\\coloneqq\\\\frac{Q}{Q-2s},$$ where $Q\\\\coloneqq 2N+2$ is\\nthe homogeneous dimension of $\\\\mathbbm{H}^N$. We prove the existence of\\nglobal-in-time solutions for the supercritical case $(p>p_F),$ and the\\nnon-existence of global-in-time solutions for the subcritical case $(1<p<p_F).$\\nFor the critical case $p=p_F,$ we provide a class of functions for which the\\nsolution blows up in finite time. These results extend the classical Fujita\\nphenomenon to a sub-Riemannian setting with the nonlocal effects of the\\nfractional sub-Laplacian. Our proof methods intertwine analytic techniques with\\nthe geometric structure of the Heisenberg group.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:17:57Z\"}"}
