{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10983v1\", \"title\": \"ProtFlow: Fast Protein Sequence Design via Flow Matching on Compressed\\n  Protein Language Model Embeddings\", \"summary\": \"The design of protein sequences with desired functionalities is a fundamental\\ntask in protein engineering. Deep generative methods, such as autoregressive\\nmodels and diffusion models, have greatly accelerated the discovery of novel\\nprotein sequences. However, these methods mainly focus on local or shallow\\nresidual semantics and suffer from low inference efficiency, large modeling\\nspace and high training cost. To address these challenges, we introduce\\nProtFlow, a fast flow matching-based protein sequence design framework that\\noperates on embeddings derived from semantically meaningful latent space of\\nprotein language models. By compressing and smoothing the latent space,\\nProtFlow enhances performance while training on limited computational\\nresources. Leveraging reflow techniques, ProtFlow enables high-quality\\nsingle-step sequence generation. Additionally, we develop a joint design\\npipeline for the design scene of multichain proteins. We evaluate ProtFlow\\nacross diverse protein design tasks, including general peptides and long-chain\\nproteins, antimicrobial peptides, and antibodies. Experimental results\\ndemonstrate that ProtFlow outperforms task-specific methods in these\\napplications, underscoring its potential and broad applicability in\\ncomputational protein sequence design and analysis.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,q-bio.BM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T08:46:53Z\"}"}
