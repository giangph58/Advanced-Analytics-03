{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20956v1\", \"title\": \"The Development of Reflective Practice on a Work-Based Software\\n  Engineering Program: A Longitudinal Study\", \"summary\": \"This study examines the development of reflective practice among students on\\na four-year work-based Software Engineering program. Using two established\\nmodels of reflection - Boud et al.'s Model of Reflective Process and Bain et\\nal.'s 5R Framework for Reflection - we analyse a series of reflective\\nassignments submitted by students over four years. Our longitudinal analysis\\nreveals clear trends in how students' reflective abilities evolve over the\\ncourse of the program. We find that more sophisticated forms of reflection,\\nsuch as integration of knowledge, appropriation of skills, and reconstruction\\nof practice, increase markedly in prevalence in later years. The complementary\\nnature of workplace experience and university study is highlighted in students'\\nreflections, demonstrating a key benefit of the work-based learning approach.\\nBy the final year, all students demonstrate the ability to reconstruct their\\nexperiences to inform future practice. Our findings provide insight into how\\nreflective practice develops in Software Engineering education and suggest\\npotential value in incorporating more structured reflection into traditional\\ndegree programs. The study also reveals instances of meta-reflection, where\\nstudents reflect on the value of reflection itself, indicating a deep\\nengagement with the reflective process. While acknowledging limitations, this\\nwork offers a unique longitudinal perspective on the development of reflective\\npractice in work-based Software Engineering education.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:28:10Z\"}"}
