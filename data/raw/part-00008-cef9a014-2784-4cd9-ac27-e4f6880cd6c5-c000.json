{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24165v1\", \"title\": \"Predicting Targeted Therapy Resistance in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer\\n  Using Multimodal Machine Learning\", \"summary\": \"Lung cancer is the primary cause of cancer death globally, with non-small\\ncell lung cancer (NSCLC) emerging as its most prevalent subtype. Among NSCLC\\npatients, approximately 32.3% have mutations in the epidermal growth factor\\nreceptor (EGFR) gene. Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase\\ninhibitor (TKI), has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in the treatment of NSCLC\\npatients with activating and T790M resistance EGFR mutations. Despite its\\nestablished efficacy, drug resistance poses a significant challenge for\\npatients to fully benefit from osimertinib. The absence of a standard tool to\\naccurately predict TKI resistance, including that of osimertinib, remains a\\ncritical obstacle. To bridge this gap, in this study, we developed an\\ninterpretable multimodal machine learning model designed to predict patient\\nresistance to osimertinib among late-stage NSCLC patients with activating EGFR\\nmutations, achieving a c-index of 0.82 on a multi-institutional dataset. This\\nmachine learning model harnesses readily available data routinely collected\\nduring patient visits and medical assessments to facilitate precision lung\\ncancer management and informed treatment decisions. By integrating various data\\ntypes such as histology images, next generation sequencing (NGS) data,\\ndemographics data, and clinical records, our multimodal model can generate\\nwell-informed recommendations. Our experiment results also demonstrated the\\nsuperior performance of the multimodal model over single modality models\\n(c-index 0.82 compared with 0.75 and 0.77), thus underscoring the benefit of\\ncombining multiple modalities in patient outcome prediction.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:47:02Z\"}"}
