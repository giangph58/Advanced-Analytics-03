{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17558v1\", \"title\": \"Quasi-particle residue and charge of the one-dimensional Fermi polaron\", \"summary\": \"We consider a mobile impurity coupled to an ideal Fermi gas in one spatial\\ndimension through an attractive contact interaction. We calculate the\\nquasi-particle residue $Z$ exactly, based on Bethe Ansatz and diagrammatic\\nMonte Carlo methods, and with varational Ansatz up to one particle-hole\\nexcitation of the Fermi sea. We find that the exact quasi-particle residue\\nvanishes in the thermodynamic limit as a power law in the number of particles,\\nconsistent with the Luttinger-liquid paradigm and the breakdown of Fermi-liquid\\ntheory. The variational Ansatz, however, predicts a finite value of $Z$, even\\nin the thermodynamic limit. We also study how the presence of the impurity\\naffects the density of the spin-up sea by calculating the pair correlation\\nfunction. Subtracting the homogeneous background and integrating over all\\ndistances gives the charge $Q$. This charge turns out to grow continuously from\\n0 at zero coupling to 1 in the strong-coupling limit. The varational Ansatz\\npredicts $Q=0$ at all couplings. So, although the variational Ansatz has been\\nshown to be remarkably accurate for the energy and the effective mass, it fails\\neven qualitatively when predicting $Z$ and the pair correlation function in the\\nthermodynamic limit.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas,cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T13:50:46Z\"}"}
