{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24060v1\", \"title\": \"Quantization of Lie-Poisson algebra and Lie algebra solutions of\\n  mass-deformed type IIB matrix model\", \"summary\": \"A quantization of Lie-Poisson algebras is studied. The mass-deformed IIB\\nmatrix model admits classical solutions constructed from the basis of any\\nsemisimple Lie algebra. We consider the geometry described by the classical\\nsolutions of the Lie algebras in the limit where the mass vanishes and the\\nmatrix size is infinite. Lie-Poisson varieties are regarded as such geometric\\nobjects. We provide a quantization called ``weak matrix regularization''of any\\nLie-Poisson algebra (linear Poisson algebra) on the algebraic variety defined\\nby its Casimir polynomials. The Lie algebra that gives weak matrix\\nregularization is not necessarily semisimple. Casimir polynomials correspond\\nwith Casimir operators of the Lie algebra by the quantization. This\\nquantization is a generalization of the fuzzy sphere. In order to define the\\nweak matrix regularization of the quotient space by the ideal generated by the\\nCasimir polynomials, we take a construction method that fixes a reduced\\nGr\\\\\\\"obner basis of the ideal. The Gr\\\\\\\"obner basis determines remainders of\\npolynomials. The operation of replacing this remainders with representation\\nmatrices of a Lie algebra roughly corresponds to a weak matrix regularization.\\nAs concrete examples, we construct weak matrix regularization for $su(2)$ and\\n$su(3)$. In the case of $su(3)$, we not only construct weak matrix\\nregularization for the quadratic Casimir polynomial, but also construct weak\\nmatrix regularization for the cubic Casimir polynomial.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:21:15Z\"}"}
