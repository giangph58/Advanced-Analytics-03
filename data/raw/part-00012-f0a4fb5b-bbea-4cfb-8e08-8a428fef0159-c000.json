{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10181v1\", \"title\": \"A New Paradigm in IBR Modeling for Power Flow and Short Circuit Analysis\", \"summary\": \"The fault characteristics of inverter-based resources (IBRs) are different\\nfrom conventional synchronous generators. The fault response of IBRs is\\nnon-linear due to saturation states and mainly determined by fault ride through\\n(FRT) strategies of the associated voltage source converter (VSC). This results\\nin prohibitively large solution times for power flows considering these short\\ncircuit characteristics, especially when the power system states change fast\\ndue to uncertainty in IBR generations. To overcome this, a phasor-domain steady\\nstate (SS) short circuit (SC) solver for IBR dominated power systems is\\nproposed in this paper, and subsequently the developed IBR models are\\nincorporated with a novel Jacobian-based Power Flow (PF) solver. In this\\nmultiphase PF solver, any power system components can be modeled by considering\\ntheir original non-linear or linear mathematical representations. Moreover, two\\nnovel FRT strategies are proposed to fully utilize the converter capacity and\\nto comply with IEEE-2800 2022 std and German grid code. The results are\\ncompared with the Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) simulation on the IEEE 34\\ntest network and the 120 kV EPRI benchmark system. The developed IBR sequence\\ndomain PF model demonstrates more accurate behavior compared to the classical\\nIBR generator model. The error in calculating the short circuit current with\\nthe proposed SC solver is less than 3%, while achieving significant speed\\nimprovements of three order of magnitudes.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T12:34:20Z\"}"}
