{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15959v1\", \"title\": \"A Novel Relationship Between Gamma Ray Burst Duration And Photospheric\\n  Radius\", \"summary\": \"Long Gamma Ray Bursts (lGRBs) are associated with jets in Type Ic broadline\\nsupernovae. The Collapsar model provides a theoretical framework for the jet\\nformation from the core collapse of a massive star in such supernovae. The GRB\\ncan only be produced after a successful jet break out from the star. Under this\\nformalism the GRB duration ($t_{\\\\rm{90}}$) has been hypothesized to be the\\ndifference between the central engine activity duration ($t_{\\\\rm{eng}}$) and\\nthe jet breakout time ($t_{\\\\rm{bo}}$), that is $t_{\\\\rm{90}} = t_{\\\\rm{eng}} -\\nt_{\\\\rm{bo}}$. This disallows $t_{\\\\rm{90}} > t_{\\\\rm{eng}}$ and puts a lower\\nbound on successful lGRB jet central engine duration ($t_{\\\\rm{eng}} >\\nt_{\\\\rm{bo}}$), various numerical simulations have shown otherwise. This study\\nconsiders a photospheric GRB emission from a relativistic jet punching out of a\\nWolf-Rayet-like star. We use the bolometric lightcurve generated to calculate\\nthe lGRB duration ($t_{\\\\rm{90}}$) for varying engine duration. We find for\\nlonger engine duration the lGRB lightcurve reflects the jet profile and\\n$t_{\\\\rm{90}} \\\\approx t_{\\\\rm{eng}}$. While for shorter engine duration, the\\n$t_{\\\\rm{90}}$ has photospheric radius ($R_{\\\\rm{ph}}$) dependence. This can be\\nmodeled by a relation, $t_{\\\\rm{90}} = t^{\\\\rm{90}}_{\\\\rm{eng}} +\\n0.03\\\\left(\\\\frac{R_{\\\\rm{ph}}}{c}\\\\right)$, where c is the speed of light, with a\\nlower bound on $t_{\\\\rm{90}}$ for a successful lGRB. This relation should be\\nmost relevant for possible low-luminous lGRBs originating from a collapsar with\\ncentral engine duration comparable to the jet breakout time.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T14:55:26Z\"}"}
