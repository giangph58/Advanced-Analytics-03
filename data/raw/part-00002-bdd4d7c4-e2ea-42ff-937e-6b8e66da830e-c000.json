{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21313v1\", \"title\": \"Evolution of the inner accretion flow and the white-dwarf spin pulse\\n  during the 2023 outburst in GK Persei\", \"summary\": \"We present our X-ray and optical observations performed by NICER, NuSTAR, and\\nTomo-e Gozen during the 2023 outburst in the intermediate polar GK Persei. The\\nX-ray spectrum consisted of three components: blackbody emission of several\\ntens of eVs from the irradiated white-dwarf surface, a source possibly\\nincluding several emission lines around 1 keV, and multi-temperature\\nbremsstrahlung emission from the accretion column. The 351.3-s white-dwarf spin\\npulse was detected in X-rays, and the observable X-ray flux from the column\\ndrastically decreased at the off-pulse phase, which suggests that the\\nabsorption of the column by the accreting gas called the curtain was the major\\ncause of the pulse. As the system became brighter in optical, the column became\\nfainter, the pulse amplitude became higher, and the energy dependence of pulses\\nbecame weaker at $<$8~keV. These phenomena could be explained by the column's\\nmore pronounced absorption by the denser curtain as mass accretion rates\\nincreased. The blackbody and line fluxes rapidly decreased at the optical\\ndecline, which suggests the expansion of the innermost disk edge with\\ndecreasing accretion rates. The electron scattering or the column geometry may\\nbe associated with almost no energy dependence of high-energy pulses. The\\nirradiated vertically-thick structure at the disk may generate optical QPOs\\nwith a period of $\\\\sim$5700 s.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T04:55:48Z\"}"}
