{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17322v1\", \"title\": \"Testing Conditional Independence via Density Ratio Regression\", \"summary\": \"This paper develops a conditional independence (CI) test from a conditional\\ndensity ratio (CDR) for weakly dependent data. The main contribution is\\npresenting a closed-form expression for the estimated conditional density ratio\\nfunction with good finite-sample performance. The key idea is exploiting the\\nlinear sieve combined with the quadratic norm. Matsushita et al. (2022)\\nexploited the linear sieve to estimate the unconditional density ratio. We must\\nexploit the linear sieve twice to estimate the conditional density ratio.\\nFirst, we estimate an unconditional density ratio with an unweighted sieve\\nleast-squares regression, as done in Matsushita et al. (2022), and then the\\nconditional density ratio with a weighted sieve least-squares regression, where\\nthe weights are the estimated unconditional density ratio. The proposed test\\nhas several advantages over existing alternatives. First, the test statistic is\\ninvariant to the monotone transformation of the data distribution and has a\\nclosed-form expression that enhances computational speed and efficiency.\\nSecond, the conditional density ratio satisfies the moment restrictions. The\\nestimated ratio satisfies the empirical analog of those moment restrictions. As\\na result, the estimated density ratio is unlikely to have extreme values.\\nThird, the proposed test can detect all deviations from conditional\\nindependence at rates arbitrarily close to $n^{-1/2}$ , and the local power\\nloss is independent of the data dimension. A small-scale simulation study\\nindicates that the proposed test outperforms the alternatives in various\\ndependence structures.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T07:23:29Z\"}"}
