However, it is a common practice to use it\\nfor relativistic fluid flow equations due to its simplicity. Here we develop a\\nhigh-order Lax-Wendroff flux reconstruction method on Cartesian grids for\\nsolving special relativistic hydrodynamics equations with several general\\nequations of state available in the literature. We also study the conversion\\nfrom conservative to primitive variables, which depends on the equation of\\nstate in use, and provide an alternative method of conversion when the existing\\napproach does not succeed. For the admissibility of the solution, we blend the\\nhigh-order method with a low-order method on sub-cells and prove its physical\\nadmissible property in the case of all the equations of state used here.\\nLastly, we validate the scheme by several test cases having strong\\ndiscontinuities, large Lorentz factor, and low density or pressure in one and\\ntwo dimensions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA,gr-qc,G.1.8\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T11:00:34Z\"}"}
