These systems naturally arise\\nin physical setups featuring long-range many-body interactions, and are\\nexperimentally realized in platforms such as Rydberg atom arrays, cold atoms in\\noptical cavities, ion traps, and dipolar systems. They hold broad potential for\\napplications in quantum computing and quantum sensing. In this work, we reveal\\nan exact theoretical mechanism governing such non-locally and mesoscopically\\ncoupled systems. We demonstrate that the effect of general environments on the\\nsystem exhibits a universal bosonic character. Specifically, the exact effect\\nthat environments have on the system, regardless of their microscopic details,\\nis equivalently produced by the interaction with a reservoir of non-interacting\\nbosonic modes. The emergent 'bosonization' of the environment results from the\\nmesoscopic coupling in the thermodynamic limit and can be interpreted as a\\nmanifestation of the central limit theorem. While this effect has been observed\\nin specific models before, we show that it is, in fact, a universal feature.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T16:07:44Z\"}"}
