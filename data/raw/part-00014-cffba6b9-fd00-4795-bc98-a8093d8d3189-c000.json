{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11819v1\", \"title\": \"Refractive Index, Its Chromatic Disper-sion, and Thermal Coefficients of\\n  Four Less Common Glycols\", \"summary\": \"We report comprehensive measurements of the refractive index as a function of\\nwavelength and temperature for four less commonly studied glycols:\\npentaethylene glycol, hexaethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol (mixture of\\nisomers), and tripropylene glycol. The measurements cover the spectral range of\\n390-1070 nm and temperatures from 1{\\\\deg}C to 45{\\\\deg}C. The data were modeled\\nusing a two-pole Sellmeier equation, with temperature dependence captured by\\nwavelength-dependent thermal coefficients. The resulting fit parameters are\\nprovided in tabulated form. Experimental uncertainties in refractive index,\\nwavelength, and temperature were rigorously evaluated and incorporated into the\\nanalysis. The influence of sample purity - including residual water content and\\nmanufacturer-reported impurities - was assessed and accounted for in the\\nuncertainty estimates. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset to\\nsystematically characterize both chromatic dispersion and thermal variation of\\nthe refractive index for these glycols over such a broad spectral and\\ntemperature range. The validated fitting equations and parameters are suitable\\nfor use in optical modeling, materials characterization, and related\\napplications. All raw data are available in a publicly accessible repository.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T07:13:07Z\"}"}
