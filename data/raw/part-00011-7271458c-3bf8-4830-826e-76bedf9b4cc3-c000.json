{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17564v1\", \"title\": \"Doubling modulo odd integers, generalizations, and unexpected\\n  occurrences\", \"summary\": \"The starting point of this work is an equality between two quantities $A$ and\\n$B$ found in the literature, which involve the {\\\\em\\ndoubling-modulo-an-odd-integer} map, i.e., $x\\\\in {\\\\mathbb N} \\\\mapsto 2x\\n\\\\bmod{(2n+1)}$ for some positive integer $n$. More precisely, this doubling map\\ndefines a permutation $\\\\sigma_{2,n}$ and each of $A$ and $B$ counts the number\\n$C_2(n)$ of cycles of $\\\\sigma_{2,n}$, hence $A=B$. In the first part of this\\nnote, we give a direct proof of this last equality. To do so, we consider and\\nstudy a generalized $(k,n)$-perfect shuffle permutation $\\\\sigma_{k,n}$, where\\nwe multiply by an integer $k\\\\ge 2$ instead of $2$, and its number $C_k(n)$ of\\ncycles. The second part of this note lists some of the many occurrences and\\napplications of the doubling map and its generalizations in the literature: in\\nmathematics (combinatorics of words, dynamical systems, number theory,\\ncorrecting algorithms), but also in card-shuffling, juggling, bell-ringing,\\npoetry, and music composition.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T13:57:24Z\"}"}
