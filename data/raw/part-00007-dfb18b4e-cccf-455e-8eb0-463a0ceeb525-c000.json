{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12131v1\", \"title\": \"Equidistribution of CM points on Shimura Curves and ternary theta series\", \"summary\": \"We prove an equidistribution statement for the reduction of Galois orbits of\\nCM points on the special fiber of a Shimura curve over a totally real field,\\nconsidering both the split and the ramified case. The main novelty of the\\nramified case consists in the use of the moduli interpretation of the\\nCerednik--Drinfeld uniformisation. Our result is achieved by associating to the\\nreduction of CM points certain Hilbert modular forms of weight $3/2$ and by\\nanalyzing their Fourier coefficients. Moreover, we also deduce the Shimura\\ncurves case of the integral version of the Andr\\\\'e--Oort conjecture.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T14:45:22Z\"}"}
