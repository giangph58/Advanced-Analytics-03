{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05207v1\", \"title\": \"A Fourier-based inference method for learning interaction kernels in\\n  particle systems\", \"summary\": \"We consider the problem of inferring the interaction kernel of stochastic\\ninteracting particle systems from observations of a single particle. We adopt a\\nsemi-parametric approach and represent the interaction kernel in terms of a\\ngeneralized Fourier series. The basis functions in this expansion are tailored\\nto the problem at hand and are chosen to be orthogonal polynomials with respect\\nto the invariant measure of the mean-field dynamics. The generalized Fourier\\ncoefficients are obtained as the solution of an appropriate linear system whose\\ncoefficients depend on the moments of the invariant measure, and which are\\napproximated from the particle trajectory that we observe. We quantify the\\napproximation error in the Lebesgue space weighted by the invariant measure and\\nstudy the asymptotic properties of the estimator in the joint limit as the\\nobservation interval and the number of particles tend to infinity, i.e. the\\njoint large time-mean field limit. We also explore the regime where an\\nincreasing number of generalized Fourier coefficients is needed to represent\\nthe interaction kernel. Our theoretical results are supported by extensive\\nnumerical simulations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,cs.NA,math.NA,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:02:39Z\"}"}
