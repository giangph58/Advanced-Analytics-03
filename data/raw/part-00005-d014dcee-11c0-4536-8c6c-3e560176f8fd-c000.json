Innovations in deep neural networks\\n(DNNs) and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) now provide robust tools to\\ntackle longstanding challenges in light scattering engineering, meta-optics,\\nand nonlinear photonics. This review outlines recent progress in leveraging\\nthese computational methodologies to enhance device performance across domains\\nsuch as dynamic light modulation, antenna design, and nonlinear optical\\nphenomena. We systematically survey advancements in AI-driven forward and\\ninverse design strategies, which bypass conventional trial-and-error approaches\\nby embedding physical laws directly into optimization workflows. Furthermore,\\nthe integration of AI accelerates electromagnetic simulations and enables\\nprecise modelling of complex optical effects, including topological photonic\\nstates and nonlinear interactions. A comparative evaluation of algorithmic\\nframeworks highlights their strengths in balancing computational efficiency,\\nmulti-objective optimization, and fabrication feasibility. Challenges such as\\nlimited interpretability of AI models and data scarcity for unconventional\\noptical modes are critically addressed. Finally, we emphasize future\\nopportunities in scalable multi-physics modelling, adaptive architectures, and\\npractical deployment of AI-optimized photonic devices. This work underscores\\nthe pivotal role of AI in transcending traditional design limitations, thereby\\npropelling the development of next-generation photonic technologies with\\nunprecedented functionality and efficiency.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T09:23:00Z\"}"}
