We propose a novel, interpretable additive model tailored for\\nsuch data, designed to deliver both high predictive accuracy and clear\\ninterpretability. The model features bivariate coefficient surfaces to\\nrepresent relationships across panel dimensions, with sparsity introduced via\\npenalized smoothing and group bridge regression. This enables simultaneous\\nestimation of the surfaces and identification of significant inter-dimensional\\neffects. Through Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application to\\nJapanese subnational age-specific mortality rates, we demonstrate the proposed\\nmodel's superior forecasting performance and interpretability compared to\\nexisting functional time series approaches.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,stat.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:37:15Z\"}"}
