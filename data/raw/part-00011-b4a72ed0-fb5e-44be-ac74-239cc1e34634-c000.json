{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11264v1\", \"title\": \"DeepSelective: Feature Gating and Representation Matching for\\n  Interpretable Clinical Prediction\", \"summary\": \"The rapid accumulation of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has transformed\\nhealthcare by providing valuable data that enhance clinical predictions and\\ndiagnoses. While conventional machine learning models have proven effective,\\nthey often lack robust representation learning and depend heavily on\\nexpert-crafted features. Although deep learning offers powerful solutions, it\\nis often criticized for its lack of interpretability. To address these\\nchallenges, we propose DeepSelective, a novel end to end deep learning\\nframework for predicting patient prognosis using EHR data, with a strong\\nemphasis on enhancing model interpretability. DeepSelective combines data\\ncompression techniques with an innovative feature selection approach,\\nintegrating custom-designed modules that work together to improve both accuracy\\nand interpretability. Our experiments demonstrate that DeepSelective not only\\nenhances predictive accuracy but also significantly improves interpretability,\\nmaking it a valuable tool for clinical decision-making.
