Let $(R_{j}(n))_{n\\\\ge 1}$ be a linear\\nrecurrence sequence for every $j=0,1,\\\\ldots, M$, and we set $f(n)=(R_0\\\\circ\\n\\\\cdots \\\\circ R_M)(n)$, where $(S\\\\circ T)(n)= S(T(n))$. In this paper, we obtain\\nsufficient conditions on $(R_{0}(n))_{n\\\\ge 1},\\\\ldots, (R_{M}(n))_{n\\\\ge 1}$ so\\nthat the intervals $(|f(n)|-c\\\\log n, |f(n)|+c\\\\log n)$ do not contain any prime\\nnumbers for infinitely many integers $n\\\\ge 1$, where $c$ is an explicit\\npositive constant depending only on the orders of $R_0,\\\\ldots, R_M$. As a\\ncorollary, we show that if for each $j=1,2,\\\\ldots, M$, the sequence\\n$(R_j(n))_{n\\\\ge 1}$ is positive, strictly increasing, and the constant term of\\nits characteristic polynomial is $\\\\pm 1$, then for every Pisot or Salem number\\n$\\\\alpha$, the numbers $\\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^{(R_1\\\\circ \\\\cdots \\\\circ R_M)(n)} \\\\rfloor\\n$ are composite for infinitely many integers $n\\\\ge 1$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T08:55:16Z\"}"}
