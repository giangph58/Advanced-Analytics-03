{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04568v1\", \"title\": \"Conformal Survival Bands for Risk Screening under Right-Censoring\", \"summary\": \"We propose a method to quantify uncertainty around individual survival\\ndistribution estimates using right-censored data, compatible with any survival\\nmodel. Unlike classical confidence intervals, the survival bands produced by\\nthis method offer predictive rather than population-level inference, making\\nthem useful for personalized risk screening. For example, in a low-risk\\nscreening scenario, they can be applied to flag patients whose survival band at\\n12 months lies entirely above 50\\\\%, while ensuring that at least half of\\nflagged individuals will survive past that time on average. Our approach builds\\non recent advances in conformal inference and integrates ideas from inverse\\nprobability of censoring weighting and multiple testing with false discovery\\nrate control. We provide asymptotic guarantees and show promising performance\\nin finite samples with both simulated and real data.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T17:03:22Z\"}"}
