{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12250v1\", \"title\": \"AnomalyGen: An Automated Semantic Log Sequence Generation Framework with\\n  LLM for Anomaly Detection\", \"summary\": \"The scarcity of high-quality public log datasets has become a critical\\nbottleneck in advancing log-based anomaly detection techniques. Current\\ndatasets exhibit three fundamental limitations: (1) incomplete event coverage,\\n(2) artificial patterns introduced by static analysis-based generation\\nframeworks, and (3) insufficient semantic awareness. To address these\\nchallenges, we present AnomalyGen, the first automated log synthesis framework\\nspecifically designed for anomaly detection. Our framework introduces a novel\\nfour-phase architecture that integrates enhanced program analysis with\\nChain-of-Thought reasoning (CoT reasoning), enabling iterative log generation\\nand anomaly annotation without requiring physical system execution. Evaluations\\non Hadoop and HDFS distributed systems demonstrate that AnomalyGen achieves\\nsubstantially broader log event coverage (38-95 times improvement over existing\\ndatasets) while producing more operationally realistic log sequences compared\\nto static analysis-based approaches. When augmenting benchmark datasets with\\nsynthesized logs, we observe maximum F1-score improvements of 3.7% (average\\n1.8% improvement across three state-of-the-art anomaly detection models). This\\nwork not only establishes a high-quality benchmarking resource for automated\\nlog analysis but also pioneers a new paradigm for applying large language\\nmodels (LLMs) in software engineering workflows.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T16:54:38Z\"}"}
