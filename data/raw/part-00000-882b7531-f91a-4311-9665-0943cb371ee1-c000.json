We study whether these inferences can\\ninstead be derived by analogy to known inferences, without need for\\ncomposition. We investigate this by (1) building a model of analogical\\nreasoning using similarity over lexical items, and (2) asking human\\nparticipants to reason by analogy. While we find that this strategy works well\\nfor a large proportion of the dataset of Ross et al. (2025), there are novel\\ncombinations for which both humans and LLMs derive convergent inferences but\\nwhich are not well handled by analogy. We thus conclude that the mechanism\\nhumans and LLMs use to generalize in these cases cannot be fully reduced to\\nanalogy, and likely involves composition.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:41:16Z\"}"}
