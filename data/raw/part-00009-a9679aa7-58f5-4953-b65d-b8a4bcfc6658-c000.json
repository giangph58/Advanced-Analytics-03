{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04961v1\", \"title\": \"ADD: Physics-Based Motion Imitation with Adversarial Differential\\n  Discriminators\", \"summary\": \"Multi-objective optimization problems, which require the simultaneous\\noptimization of multiple terms, are prevalent across numerous applications.\\nExisting multi-objective optimization methods often rely on manually tuned\\naggregation functions to formulate a joint optimization target. The performance\\nof such hand-tuned methods is heavily dependent on careful weight selection, a\\ntime-consuming and laborious process. These limitations also arise in the\\nsetting of reinforcement-learning-based motion tracking for physically\\nsimulated characters, where intricately crafted reward functions are typically\\nused to achieve high-fidelity results. Such solutions not only require domain\\nexpertise and significant manual adjustment, but also limit the applicability\\nof the resulting reward function across diverse skills. To bridge this gap, we\\npresent a novel adversarial multi-objective optimization technique that is\\nbroadly applicable to a range of multi-objective optimization problems,\\nincluding motion tracking. The proposed adversarial differential discriminator\\nreceives a single positive sample, yet is still effective at guiding the\\noptimization process. We demonstrate that our technique can enable characters\\nto closely replicate a variety of acrobatic and agile behaviors, achieving\\ncomparable quality to state-of-the-art motion-tracking methods, without relying\\non manually tuned reward functions.
