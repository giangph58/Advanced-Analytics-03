This long standing problem is solved through the construction of\\nnew comparison isomorphisms relating $\\\\ell$-adic cohomology of a separated\\nscheme of finite type over an algebraically closed field of positive\\ncharacteristic with its rigid cohomology. Taking advantage of the description\\nof categories of $\\\\ell$-adic sheaves of geometric origin as categories of\\nmodules over $\\\\ell$-adic cohomology in the stable category of motivic sheaves,\\nthese independence of $\\\\ell$-results are promoted to independence of $\\\\ell$ of\\nsuitable categories of $\\\\ell$-adic sheaves themselves.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG,math.KT,math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T12:59:51Z\"}"}
