To\\noptimize the rendering pipeline, we render the scene to four cubemaps, before\\nsampling relevant cubemaps onto the canvas. For an interactive user experience,\\nwe perform stereoscopic view rendering and off-axis projection to anchor the\\nimage to the viewer. This technique is being used to project virtual worlds at\\nCMU ETC, and is a step in creating immersive viewing experiences.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GR\", \"categories\": \"cs.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T16:42:13Z\"}"}
