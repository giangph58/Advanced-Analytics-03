First, the regularity of the solution to the considered problem is\\ninvestigated, finding that its first-order time derivative exhibits singularity\\nat $t=0^+$ and its second-order time derivative shows singularity at both\\n$t=0^+$ and $\\\\tau^+$, while the solution can be decomposed into its singular\\nand regular components. Then, we derive a fully discrete finite element scheme\\nto solve the considered problem based on the standard Galerkin finite element\\nmethod in space and the Gr\\\\\\\"unwald-Letnikov type approximation in time. The\\nanalysis shows that the developed numerical scheme is stable. In order to\\ndiscuss the error estimate, a new discrete Gronwall inequality is established.\\nUnder the above decomposition of the solution, we obtain a local error estimate\\nin time for the developed numerical scheme. Finally, some numerical tests are\\nprovided to support our theoretical analysis.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T08:09:56Z\"}"}
