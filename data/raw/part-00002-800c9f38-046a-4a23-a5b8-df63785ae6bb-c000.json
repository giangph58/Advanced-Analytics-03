Observing this background is\\nchallenging due to the weakness of the signal and the simultaneous presence of\\nan astrophysical background generated by many unresolved late-time sources. One\\npossible way to distinguish between the two is to examine their anisotropies.\\nIn this paper we calculate the primordial correlation function of gravitational\\nwave anisotropies in the cosmological background generated by axion inflation,\\nwhere the inflaton is a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson coupled to gauge fields.\\nIn this scenario, tensor modes arise not only from the standard amplification\\nof vacuum fluctuations present in any inflationary model, but also from the\\ninverse decay process of the produced gauge fields. The correlator of\\ngravitational wave anisotropies consists therefore of two main components: the\\ncontribution from vacuum tensor modes and the contribution from tensor modes\\nsourced by the gauge fields. Our analysis shows that, while the former,\\npreviously studied in the literature, is negligible, the one arising from the\\nsourced tensor modes, normalized by the fractional energy density at\\ninterferometer frequencies, can reach values as large as\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$. This result shows that axion inflation can generate\\nlarge anisotropies with the potential to be observed by gravitational wave\\ndetectors within a reasonable time frame.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:56:58Z\"}"}
