The objective is to highlight the benefits of adding\\nnonlinear geometrical damping in addition to the cubic stiffness nonlinearity.\\nThe behaviour of the system is investigated theoretically by using the mixed\\nharmonic balance multiple scales method. Based on the obtained slow flow\\nequations, a design procedure that maximizes the dynamic range of the NES is\\npresented. Singularity theory is used to express conditions for the birth of\\ndetached resonance cure independently of the forcing frequency. It is shown\\nthat the presence of a detached resonance curve is not necessarily detrimental\\nto the performance of the NES. Moreover, the detached resonance curve can be\\ncompletely suppressed by adding nonlinear damping. The results of the design\\nprocedure are then compared to numerical simulations.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.class-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.class-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T08:28:36Z\"}"}
