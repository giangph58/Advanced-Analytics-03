{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04301v1\", \"title\": \"Exit Incentives for Carbon Emissive Firms\", \"summary\": \"We develop a continuous-time model of incentives for carbon emissive firms to\\nexit the market based on a compensation payment identical to all firms. In our\\nmodel, firms enjoy profits from production modeled as a simple geometric\\nBrownian motion and do not bear any environmental damage from production. A\\nregulator maximises the expected discounted value of firms profits from\\nproduction minus environmental damages caused by production and proposes a\\ncompensation payment whose dynamics is known to the firms. We provide in both\\nsituations closed-form expressions for the compensation payment process and the\\nexit thresholds of each firms. We apply our model to the crude oil market. We\\nshow that market concentration both reduces the total expected discounted\\npayment to firms and the expected closing time of polluting assets. We extend\\nthis framework to the case of two countries each regulating its own market. The\\npresence of a second mover advantage leads to the possibility of multiple\\nequilibria. Applying this result to large producing countries, we find that\\nthey are unlikely to agree on the timing to exit market.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,math.OC,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T10:17:32Z\"}"}
