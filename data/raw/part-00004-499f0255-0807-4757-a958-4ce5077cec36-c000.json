{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21425v1\", \"title\": \"Atmospheric Heating Events Associated with Fine-scale Flux Emergence in\\n  Ephemeral Regions\", \"summary\": \"Coronal heating has puzzled solar physicists for decades. The question of why\\nthe Sun's upper atmosphere is significantly hotter than its lower atmosphere\\nremains a key mystery. It is commonly believed that the source of coronal\\nheating comes from the Sun's magnetic field, and more complex magnetic dynamics\\nis more efficient in heating. In an earlier work we studied the secondary (or\\nfiner-scale) flux emergence identified in five ephemeral regions (ERs),\\nselected during the last solar minimum (Yang et al. 2024). Here we further\\nexplore the atmospheric response to the secondary flux emergences (SFEs) that\\nwere identified in the first paper. We further reveal that approximately 80\\npercent of the 172 identified SFEs are associated with atmospheric heating\\nevents. The heating is most likely associated with magnetic reconnection\\ninvolved in the SFE. Overall, a solar quiet region is heated by several hundred\\nthousand degrees, during flux emergence of an ER.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T08:33:15Z\"}"}
