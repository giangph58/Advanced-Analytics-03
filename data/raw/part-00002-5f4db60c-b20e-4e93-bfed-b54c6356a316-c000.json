Such models generally predict that, even with\\nidentical initial conditions, and for nearly the same other particle\\nparameters, a quantum coherent evolution results in a final particle\\ndistribution with significant asymmetry. We use an exact solution of the driven\\nbosonic Tavis-Cummings model for two reaction pathways in order to quantify\\nthis effect, reveal a corresponding phase transition, and identify its\\nuniversality class.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.stat-mech,gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T15:38:04Z\"}"}
