{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05064v1\", \"title\": \"Wild generalised truncation of infinite matroids\", \"summary\": \"For ${n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}}$, the $n$-truncation of a matroid $M$ of rank at\\nleast $n$ is the matroid whose bases are the $n$-element independent sets of\\n$M$. One can extend this definition to negative integers by letting the\\n$(-n)$-truncation be the matroid whose bases are all the sets that can be\\nobtained by deleting $n$ elements of a base of $M$. If $M$ has infinite rank,\\nthen for distinct ${m,n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}}$ the $m$-truncation and the\\n$n$-truncation are distinct matroids.\\n  Inspired by the work of Bowler and Geschke on infinite uniform matroids, we\\nprovide a natural definition of generalised truncations that encompasses the\\nnotions mentioned above. We call a generalised truncation wild if it is not an\\n$n$-truncation for any ${n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}}$ and we prove that, under Martin's\\nAxiom, any finitary matroid of infinite rank and size of less than continuum\\nadmits ${2^{2^{\\\\aleph_0}}}$ wild generalised truncations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,math.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:34:40Z\"}"}
