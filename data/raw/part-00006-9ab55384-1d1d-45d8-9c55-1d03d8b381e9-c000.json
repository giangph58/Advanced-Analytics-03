{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10923v1\", \"title\": \"Fast-Powerformer: A Memory-Efficient Transformer for Accurate Mid-Term\\n  Wind Power Forecasting\", \"summary\": \"Wind power forecasting (WPF), as a significant research topic within\\nrenewable energy, plays a crucial role in enhancing the security, stability,\\nand economic operation of power grids. However, due to the high stochasticity\\nof meteorological factors (e.g., wind speed) and significant fluctuations in\\nwind power output, mid-term wind power forecasting faces a dual challenge of\\nmaintaining high accuracy and computational efficiency. To address these\\nissues, this paper proposes an efficient and lightweight mid-term wind power\\nforecasting model, termed Fast-Powerformer. The proposed model is built upon\\nthe Reformer architecture, incorporating structural enhancements such as a\\nlightweight Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) embedding module, an input\\ntransposition mechanism, and a Frequency Enhanced Channel Attention Mechanism\\n(FECAM). These improvements enable the model to strengthen temporal feature\\nextraction, optimize dependency modeling across variables, significantly reduce\\ncomputational complexity, and enhance sensitivity to periodic patterns and\\ndominant frequency components. Experimental results conducted on multiple\\nreal-world wind farm datasets demonstrate that the proposed Fast-Powerformer\\nachieves superior prediction accuracy and operational efficiency compared to\\nmainstream forecasting approaches. Furthermore, the model exhibits fast\\ninference speed and low memory consumption, highlighting its considerable\\npractical value for real-world deployment scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T07:09:54Z\"}"}
