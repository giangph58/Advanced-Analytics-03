The field generally\\nfragments into Q-balls, whose rapid decay induces enhanced gravitational waves.\\nIn this Letter, we investigate the anisotropies in this gravitational wave\\nbackground as a new essential observable for AD baryogenesis. The evolution of\\nAD field causes non-Gaussian baryonic isocurvature perturbations, and the\\nnon-Gaussianity modulates the spatial distribution of Q-balls on large scales,\\nresulting in large-scale anisotropies in the Q-ball-induced gravitational wave\\nbackground. We present that the anisotropies can be significantly large with a\\nreduced angular power spectrum $\\\\sim 10^{-2}$, and can be detected by future\\nexperiments like LISA. Moreover, these anisotropies universally reveal the\\n$CP$-violating dynamics of AD field, opening a novel road to explore the\\nlongstanding baryon asymmetry puzzle.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:18:29Z\"}"}
