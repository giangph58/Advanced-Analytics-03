Two of these contributions were a focus on theory that\\nactually supports practice, and the identification of well-posed aspects of\\ninverse problems that may quite ill-posed. This paper illustrates these two\\nthemes in the context of Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), which is both\\nvery ill-posed and very practical. We show that for a highly constrained\\nversion of this inverse problem, in which a small elliptical inclusion in a\\nhomogeneous background is to be identified, optimization of the experimental\\ndesign (that is, electrode locations) vastly improves the stability of the\\nsolution.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:21:53Z\"}"}
