Those conditions are related to a certain control of the\\nRiesz potential of the measure $\\\\mu$. We also present sufficient conditions for\\nthe solvability when $p=\\\\infty$ adding a canceling condition on the operator.\\nOur method is based on a new weighted $L^1$ Stein-Weiss type inequality on\\nmeasures for a special class of vector fields.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T11:33:46Z\"}"}
