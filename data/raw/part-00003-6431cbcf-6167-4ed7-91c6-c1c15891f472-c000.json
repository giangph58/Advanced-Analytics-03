{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12043v1\", \"title\": \"Effect of pressure, doping and magnetism on electronic structure and\\n  phonon dispersion of FeSe\", \"summary\": \"We present a Density Functional Theory (DFT) based first-principles study on\\niron chalcogenides superconductor FeSe, systematically investigating pressure\\nand doping induced modifications to its electronic, magnetic, and lattice\\ndynamical properties. Our constrained-DFT calculations in striped\\nantiferromagnetic and staggered dimer phase reveal a non-trivial dependence of\\nthe electronic structure on the local magnetic moment at all pressures. Sulpher\\n(S) and tellurium (Te) doping exert opposing effects on the electronic\\nstructure, attributable to their contrasting chemical pressure effects\\n(negative for S, positive for Te). Lattice dynamics calculations divulge\\ndistinct dependence of different phonon modes on local magnetic moment in\\ndifferent magnetic phases. We identify pressure and magnetic moment-dependent\\ndynamical instability in certain magnetic phases, underscoring the intricate\\ninterplay of structural, electronic, and magnetic properties in this system.\\nInvestigation of spin-phonon coupling for different phonon modes shows the\\npresence of strong magneto-elastic coupling in FeSe with pressure distinctly\\naffecting prominent optical phonon modes -- pure iron derived $B_{1g}$ and pure\\nselenium derived $A_{1g}$. A clear indication of the change in spin-phonon\\ncoupling with pressure is visible, especially for the $B_{1g}$ mode.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T12:57:46Z\"}"}
