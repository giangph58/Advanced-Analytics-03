Here, we harness\\nmachine-learning-driven molecular dynamics to resolve the phase boundary\\nbehavior in the KNbO3-KTaO3 (KNTO) system. Our simulations reveal that chemical\\ncomposition and ordering enable precise modulation of polymorphic phase\\nboundaries (PPBs), offering a versatile pathway for materials engineering.\\nDiffused PPBs and polar nano regions, predicted by our model, highly match with\\nexperiments, underscoring the fidelity of the machine-learning atomistic\\nsimulation. Crucially, we identify elastic and electrostatic mismatches between\\nferroelectric KNbO3 and paraelectric KTaO3 as the driving forces behind complex\\nmicrostructural evolution. This work not only resolves the longstanding\\nmicrostructural debate but also establishes a generalizable framework for phase\\nboundary engineering toward next-generation high-performance ferroelectrics.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:43:10Z\"}"}
