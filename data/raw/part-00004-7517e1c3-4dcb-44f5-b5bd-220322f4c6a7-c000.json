{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03376v1\", \"title\": \"Tell Me the Good Stuff: User Preferences in Movie Recommendation\\n  Explanations\", \"summary\": \"Recommender systems play a vital role in helping users discover content in\\nstreaming services, but their effectiveness depends on users understanding why\\nitems are recommended. In this study, explanations were based solely on item\\nfeatures rather than personalized data, simulating recommendation scenarios. We\\ncompared user perceptions of one-sided (purely positive) and two-sided\\n(positive and negative) feature-based explanations for popular movie\\nrecommendations. Through an online study with 129 participants, we examined how\\nexplanation style affected perceived trust, transparency, effectiveness, and\\nsatisfaction. One-sided explanations consistently received higher ratings\\nacross all dimensions. Our findings suggest that in low-stakes entertainment\\ndomains such as popular movie recommendations, simpler positive explanations\\nmay be more effective. However, the results should be interpreted with caution\\ndue to potential confounding factors such as item familiarity and the placement\\nof negative information in explanations. This work provides practical insights\\nfor explanation design in recommender interfaces and highlights the importance\\nof context in shaping user preferences.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T09:52:33Z\"}"}
