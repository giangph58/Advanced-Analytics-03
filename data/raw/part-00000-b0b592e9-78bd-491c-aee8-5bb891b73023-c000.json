However, theoretical analyses remain limited\\nin explaining why 2D convolution is more effective in high-pass filtering than\\nself-attention and why larger kernels favor shape bias, akin to self-attention.\\nIn this paper, we employ graph spectral analysis to theoretically simulate and\\ncompare the frequency responses of 2D convolution and self-attention within a\\nunified framework. Our results corroborate previous empirical findings and\\nreveal that node connectivity, modulated by window size, is a key factor in\\nshaping spectral functions. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a\\n\\\\textit{spectral-adaptive modulation} (SPAM) mixer, which processes visual\\nfeatures in a spectral-adaptive manner using multi-scale convolutional kernels\\nand a spectral re-scaling mechanism to refine spectral components. Based on\\nSPAM, we develop SPANetV2 as a novel vision backbone. Extensive experiments\\ndemonstrate that SPANetV2 outperforms state-of-the-art models across multiple\\nvision tasks, including ImageNet-1K classification, COCO object detection, and\\nADE20K semantic segmentation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T10:53:42Z\"}"}
