We use mixture theory. The mixture's constituents are assumed to\\nbe incompressible in their pure form. We use Hamilton's principle to obtain the\\ngoverning equations, and we propose a corresponding finite element\\nimplementation. The filtration velocity and the pore pressure are allowed to be\\ndiscontinuous across the interface while some control of these discontinuities\\nis built into the interfacial constitutive behavior. To facilitate the\\npractical implementation of the formulation in a finite element scheme, we\\nintroduce a Lagrange multiplier field over the interface for the explicit\\nenforcement of the jump condition of the balance of mass. Our formulation\\nappears to recover some basic results from the literature. The novelty of the\\nwork is the formulation of an approach that can accommodate specific\\nconstitutive assumptions pertaining to the behavior of the interface that do\\nnot necessarily imply the continuity of the filtration velocity and/or of the\\npore pressure across it.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA,physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T15:26:35Z\"}"}
