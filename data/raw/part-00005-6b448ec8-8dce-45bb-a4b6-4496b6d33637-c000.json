The classical\\nshrinking target problem concerns points returning infinitely many times to a\\nsequence of shrinking balls. In the iterated function system context, the\\nshrinking balls problem is only well tractable in the case of similarity maps,\\nbut the case of affine maps is more elusive due to many geometric-dynamical\\ncomplications.\\n  In the current work, we push through these complications and compute the\\nHausdorff dimension of a set recurring to a shrinking target of geometric balls\\nin some affine iterated function systems. For these results, we have pinpointed\\na representative class of affine iterated function systems, consisting of a\\npair of diagonal affine maps, that was introduced by Przytycki and Urba\\\\'nski.\\nThe analysis splits into many sub-cases according to the type of the centre\\npoint of the targets, and the relative sizes of the targets and the\\ncontractions of the maps, illustrating the array of challenges of going beyond\\naffine maps with nice projections. The proofs require heavy machinery from, and\\nexpand, the theory of Bernoulli convolutions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T12:38:37Z\"}"}
