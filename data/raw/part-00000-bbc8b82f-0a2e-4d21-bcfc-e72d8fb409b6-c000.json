Recent technological\\ndevelopments have shown the capability of building quantum systems with\\nprogressively larger number of qubits in different platforms. The standard\\napproach based on quantum state tomography, while providing a method to\\ncompletely characterize an unknown quantum state, requires a number of\\nmeasurements that scales exponentially with the number of qubits. Other methods\\nhave been subsequently proposed and tested to reduce the number of\\nmeasurements, or to focus on specific properties of the output state rather\\nthan on its complete reconstruction. Here, we show experimentally the\\napplication of an approach, called threshold quantum state tomography, in an\\nadvanced hybrid photonic platform with states up to n=4 qubits. This method\\ndoes not require a priori knowledge on the state, and selects only the\\ninformative projectors starting from the measurement of the density matrix\\ndiagonal. We show the effectiveness of this approach in a photonic platform,\\nshowing that a consistent reduction in the number of measurement is obtained\\nwhile reconstructing relevant states for quantum protocols, with only very\\nlimited loss of information. The advantage of this protocol opens perspective\\nof its application in larger, more complex, systems.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:47:41Z\"}"}
