We have previously proposed generalization criteria that rely on\\nthe observation that Hessian eigenvalue spectral density (HESD) behaves\\nsimilarly for a wide class of NNs. This paper further studies their\\napplicability by investigating factors that can result in different types of\\nHESD. We conduct a wide range of experiments showing that HESD mainly has\\npositive eigenvalues (MP-HESD) for NN training and fine-tuning with various\\noptimizers on different datasets with different preprocessing and augmentation\\nprocedures. We also show that mainly negative HESD (MN-HESD) is a consequence\\nof external gradient manipulation, indicating that the previously proposed\\nHessian analysis methodology cannot be applied in such cases. We also propose\\ncriteria and corresponding conditions to determine HESD type and estimate NN\\ngeneralization potential. These HESD types and previously proposed\\ngeneralization criteria are combined into a unified HESD analysis methodology.\\nFinally, we discuss how HESD changes during training, and show the occurrence\\nof quasi-singular (QS) HESD and its influence on the proposed methodology and\\non the conventional assumptions about the relation between Hessian eigenvalues\\nand NN loss landscape curvature.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:43:07Z\"}"}
