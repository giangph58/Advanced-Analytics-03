{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07590v1\", \"title\": \"DWFS-Obfuscation: Dynamic Weighted Feature Selection for Robust Malware\\n  Familial Classification under Obfuscation\", \"summary\": \"Due to its open-source nature, the Android operating system has consistently\\nbeen a primary target for attackers. Learning-based methods have made\\nsignificant progress in the field of Android malware detection. However,\\ntraditional detection methods based on static features struggle to identify\\nobfuscated malicious code, while methods relying on dynamic analysis suffer\\nfrom low efficiency. To address this, we propose a dynamic weighted feature\\nselection method that analyzes the importance and stability of features,\\ncalculates scores to filter out the most robust features, and combines these\\nselected features with the program's structural information. We then utilize\\ngraph neural networks for classification, thereby improving the robustness and\\naccuracy of the detection system. We analyzed 8,664 malware samples from eight\\nmalware families and tested a total of 44,940 malware variants generated using\\nseven obfuscation strategies. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method\\nachieves an F1-score of 95.56% on the unobfuscated dataset and 92.28% on the\\nobfuscated dataset, indicating that the model can effectively detect obfuscated\\nmalware.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,I.2.7\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T09:37:43Z\"}"}
