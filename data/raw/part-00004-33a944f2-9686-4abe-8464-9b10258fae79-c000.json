{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10455v1\", \"title\": \"The stellar decomposition of Gaussian quantum states\", \"summary\": \"We introduce the stellar decomposition, a novel method for characterizing\\nnon-Gaussian states produced by photon-counting measurements on Gaussian\\nstates. Given an (m+n)-mode Gaussian state G, we express it as an (m+n)-mode\\n\\\"Gaussian core state\\\" G_core followed by a fixed m-mode Gaussian transformation\\nT that only acts on the first m modes. The defining property of the Gaussian\\ncore state G_core is that measuring the last n of its modes in the\\nphoton-number basis leaves the first m modes on a finite Fock support, i.e. a\\ncore state. Since T is measurement-independent and G_core has an exact and\\nfinite Fock representation, this decomposition exactly describes all\\nnon-Gaussian states obtainable by projecting n modes of G onto the Fock basis.\\nFor pure states we prove that a physical pair (G_core, T) always exists with\\nG_core pure and T unitary. For mixed states, we establish necessary and\\nsufficient conditions for (G_core, T) to be a Gaussian mixed state and a\\nGaussian channel. Finally, we develop a semidefinite program to extract the\\n\\\"largest\\\" possible Gaussian channel when these conditions fail. The stellar\\ndecomposition leads to practical bounds on achievable state quality in photonic\\ncircuits and for GKP state generation in particular. Our results are based on a\\nnew characterization of Gaussian completely positive maps in the Bargmann\\npicture, which may be of independent interest. As a result, this work provides\\nnovel tools for improved simulations of quantum optical systems, and for\\nunderstanding the generation of non-Gaussian resource states.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:41:54Z\"}"}
