It is a common practice to perform\\nexploratory subset analysis in early-stage studies to select the cutoff.\\nHowever, data-driven cutoff selection will often cause bias in treatment effect\\nestimates and lead to over-optimistic expectations in the future phase III\\ntrial. In this study, we first conducted extensive simulations to investigate\\nfactors influencing the bias, including the cutoff selection rule, the number\\nof candidates cutoffs, the magnitude of the predictive effect, and sample\\nsizes. Our insights emphasize the importance of accounting for bias and\\nuncertainties caused by small sample sizes and data-driven selection procedures\\nin Go/No Go decision-making, and population and sample size determination for\\nphase III studies. Secondly, we evaluated the performance of Bootstrap Bias\\nCorrection and the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) method for bias\\ncorrection through extensive simulations. We conclude by providing a\\nrecommendation for the application of the two approaches in clinical practice.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T13:22:54Z\"}"}
