In this paper, we suggest to consider photon-photon scattering as a\\nuseful source of information on transverse momentum dependent fragmentation\\nfunctions (TMD FFs), complementing semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering and\\n$e^+e^-$ annihilation processes, which provide most of the present\\nphenomenological information on TMD FFs. As a first illustrative example, we\\nstudy two-hadron azimuthal asymmetries around the jet thrust-axis in the\\nprocess $\\\\ell^+\\\\ell^-\\\\to\\\\gamma^* \\\\gamma\\\\to q\\\\bar q\\\\to h_1 h_2 + X$, in which in\\na circular lepton collider one tagged, deeply-virtual photon scatters off an\\nuntagged quasi-real photon, both originating from the initial lepton beams,\\nproducing inclusively an almost back-to-back light-hadron pair with large\\ntransverse momentum, in the $\\\\gamma^*\\\\gamma$ center of mass frame. Similar\\nprocesses, in a more complicated environment due to the presence of initial\\nhadronic states, can also be studied in ultraperipheral collisions at the LHC\\nand the planned future hadron colliders.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T10:02:12Z\"}"}
