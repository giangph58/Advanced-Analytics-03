To address this, we propose a novel compact formulation\\nthat maintains the ability to represent year-specific characteristics while\\nreducing the dimensionality of the model. The proposed compact formulation is\\nimplemented in the open-source model TulipaEnergyModel.jl and offers a\\ntractable alternative for detailed long-term energy system planning.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T08:14:19Z\"}"}
