In recent\\nyears, these models have preferred nonparametric specifications that avoid\\ndirectly estimating survival distributions via discretization. Specifically,\\nthey estimate the probability of an individual event at fixed times or the time\\nof an event at fixed probabilities (quantiles), using supervised learning.\\nBorrowing ideas from the quantile regression literature, we propose a\\nparametric survival analysis method based on the Asymmetric Laplace\\nDistribution (ALD). This distribution allows for closed-form calculation of\\npopular event summaries such as mean, median, mode, variation, and quantiles.\\nThe model is optimized by maximum likelihood to learn, at the individual level,\\nthe parameters (location, scale, and asymmetry) of the ALD distribution.\\nExtensive results on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that the\\nproposed method outperforms parametric and nonparametric approaches in terms of\\naccuracy, discrimination and calibration.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T17:34:41Z\"}"}
