{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00455v1\", \"title\": \"Data Therapist: Eliciting Domain Knowledge from Subject Matter Experts\\n  Using Large Language Models\", \"summary\": \"Effective data visualization requires not only technical proficiency but also\\na deep understanding of the domain-specific context in which data exists. This\\ncontext often includes tacit knowledge about data provenance, quality, and\\nintended use, which is rarely explicit in the dataset itself. We present the\\nData Therapist, a web-based tool that helps domain experts externalize this\\nimplicit knowledge through a mixed-initiative process combining iterative Q&A\\nwith interactive annotation. Powered by a large language model, the system\\nanalyzes user-supplied datasets, prompts users with targeted questions, and\\nallows annotation at varying levels of granularity. The resulting structured\\nknowledge base can inform both human and automated visualization design. We\\nevaluated the tool in a qualitative study involving expert pairs from Molecular\\nBiology, Accounting, Political Science, and Usable Security. The study revealed\\nrecurring patterns in how experts reason about their data and highlights areas\\nwhere AI support can improve visualization design.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T11:10:17Z\"}"}
