Bhattacharya conjectured that the exponent of $2$ in the prime\\nfactorisation of $B(m, n)$ equals $s_2(m)s_2(n)$, where $s_2(x)$ denotes the\\nnumber of $1$s in the binary expansion of $x$. We confirm this conjecture in\\nsome infinite families of special cases; most significantly, when $m$ is of the\\nform either $2^k$ or $2^k + 1$ and $n$ is arbitrary. The proof when $m = 2^k +\\n1$ is substantially more difficult, and in connection with it we develop some\\ngeneral techniques for the analysis of inequalities between binary digit sums.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T09:18:11Z\"}"}
