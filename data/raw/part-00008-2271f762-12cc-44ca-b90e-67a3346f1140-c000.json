{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15806v1\", \"title\": \"DAE-KAN: A Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Model for High-Index\\n  Differential-Algebraic Equations\", \"summary\": \"Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a promising alternative to\\nMulti-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) due to their superior function-fitting abilities\\nin data-driven modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, DAE-KAN,\\nfor solving high-index differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) by integrating\\nKANs with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). This framework not only\\npreserves the ability of traditional PINNs to model complex systems governed by\\nphysical laws but also enhances their performance by leveraging the\\nfunction-fitting strengths of KANs. Numerical experiments demonstrate that for\\nDAE systems ranging from index-1 to index-3, DAE-KAN reduces the absolute\\nerrors of both differential and algebraic variables by 1 to 2 orders of\\nmagnitude compared to traditional PINNs. To assess the effectiveness of this\\napproach, we analyze the drift-off error and find that both PINNs and DAE-KAN\\noutperform classical numerical methods in controlling this phenomenon. Our\\nresults highlight the potential of neural network methods, particularly\\nDAE-KAN, in solving high-index DAEs with substantial computational accuracy and\\ngeneralization, offering a promising solution for challenging partial\\ndifferential-algebraic equations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T11:42:02Z\"}"}
