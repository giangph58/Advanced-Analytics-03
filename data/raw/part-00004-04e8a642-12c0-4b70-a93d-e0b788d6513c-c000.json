{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12032v1\", \"title\": \"Combining Declarative and Linear Programming for Application Management\\n  in the Cloud-Edge Continuum\", \"summary\": \"This work investigates the data-aware multi-service application placement\\nproblem in Cloud-Edge settings. We previously introduced EdgeWise, a hybrid\\napproach that combines declarative programming with Mixed-Integer Linear\\nProgramming (MILP) to determine optimal placements that minimise operational\\ncosts and unnecessary data transfers. The declarative stage pre-processes\\ninfrastructure constraints to improve the efficiency of the MILP solver,\\nachieving optimal placements in terms of operational costs, with significantly\\nreduced execution times. In this extended version, we improve the declarative\\nstage with continuous reasoning, presenting EdgeWiseCR, which enables the\\nsystem to reuse existing placements and reduce unnecessary recomputation and\\nservice migrations. In addition, we conducted an expanded experimental\\nevaluation considering multiple applications, diverse network topologies, and\\nlarge-scale infrastructures with dynamic failures. The results show that\\nEdgeWiseCR achieves up to 65% faster execution compared to EdgeWise, while\\npreserving placement stability under dynamic conditions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T12:45:35Z\"}"}
