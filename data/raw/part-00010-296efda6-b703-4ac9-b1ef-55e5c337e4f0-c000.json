To approach this\\nproblem, we present DIFF-FLOOD, a probabilistic spatiotemporal forecasting\\nmethod designed based on denoising diffusion models. DIFF-FLOOD predicts\\ninundation level at a location by taking both spatial and temporal context into\\naccount. It utilizes inundation levels at neighboring locations and digital\\nelevation data as spatial context. Inundation history from a context time\\nwindow, together with additional co-variates are used as temporal context.\\nConvolutional neural networks and cross-attention mechanism are then employed\\nto capture the spatiotemporal dynamics in the data. We trained and tested\\nDIFF-FLOOD on coastal inundation data from the Eastern Shore of Virginia, a\\nregion highly impacted by coastal flooding. Our results show that, DIFF-FLOOD\\noutperforms existing forecasting methods in terms of prediction performance (6%\\nto 64% improvement in terms of two performance metrics) and scalability.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T16:13:41Z\"}"}
