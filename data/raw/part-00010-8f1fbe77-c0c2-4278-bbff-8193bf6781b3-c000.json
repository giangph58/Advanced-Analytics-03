However, most of them\\nstruggle to synthesize plausible 3D assets when the reference image is\\nflat-colored like hand drawings due to the lack of 3D illusion, which are often\\nthe most user-friendly input modalities in art content creation. To this end,\\nwe propose Art3D, a training-free method that can lift flat-colored 2D designs\\ninto 3D. By leveraging structural and semantic features with pre- trained 2D\\nimage generation models and a VLM-based realism evaluation, Art3D successfully\\nenhances the three-dimensional illusion in reference images, thus simplifying\\nthe process of generating 3D from 2D, and proves adaptable to a wide range of\\npainting styles. To benchmark the generalization performance of existing\\nimage-to-3D models on flat-colored images without 3D feeling, we collect a new\\ndataset, Flat-2D, with over 100 samples. Experimental results demonstrate the\\nperformance and robustness of Art3D, exhibiting superior generalizable capacity\\nand promising practical applicability.
