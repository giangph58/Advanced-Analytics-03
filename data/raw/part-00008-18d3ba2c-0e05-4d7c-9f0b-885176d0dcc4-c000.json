These metrics\\ninterpolate between regular black holes and one-way or traversable wormholes.\\nFirst, we investigate the light-like geodesic trajectories and derive an\\nanalytical expression for the deflection angle in terms of the bounce parameter\\nin the weak-field gravitational regime. We then turn to the strong-field\\ngravitational regime and display the behavior of the bending angle as a\\nfunction of both the impact parameter and the bounce parameter. Next, using the\\nlens equations, we analyze how the observables for \\\\textit{Sagittarius} A*\\nbehave concerning the bounce parameter. We obtain the shadow's radii for some\\nblack-bounce metrics and plot the graph of their sizes, comparing them with the\\nSchwarzschild one.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:50:36Z\"}"}
