In these RNNs, we report that an attractor-merging\\ncrisis accompanied by intermittency emerges simply by adjusting the global\\nparameter. We further reveal its underlying mechanism through a detailed\\nanalysis of the phase-space structure and demonstrate that this bifurcation\\nscenario is intrinsic to a general class of RNNs, independent of training data.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.CD\", \"categories\": \"nlin.CD,cs.LG,cs.NE,math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T06:48:51Z\"}"}
