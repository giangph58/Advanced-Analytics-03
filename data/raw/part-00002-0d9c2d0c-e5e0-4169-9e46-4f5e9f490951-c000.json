We thus associate to any quantum Hamiltonian a random\\nprocess on the plane. We set down rigorously the conditions under which such\\nrandom process becomes a Wiener process in the thermodynamic limit and the\\nassociated distribution of the distance from the origin becomes Gaussian. This\\nleads to the well known Gaussian behavior of the spectral form factor for\\nquantum chaotic (non-integrable) models, which we show to be violated at low\\ntemperature. For systems with quasi-free spectrum (integrable), instead, the\\ndistribution of the SFF is Log-Normal. We compute all the moments of the\\nspectral form factor exactly without resorting to the Gaussian approximation.\\nAssuming degeneracies in the quantum chaotic spectrum we solve the classical\\nproblem of random walker taking steps of unequal lengths. Furthermore, we\\ndemonstrate that the Hausdorff dimension of the frontier of the random walk,\\ndefined as the boundary of the unbounded component of the complement,\\napproaches 1 for the integrable Brownian motion, while the non-integrable walk\\napproaches that obtained by the Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE) with the\\nfractal dimension $4/3$. Additionally, we numerically show that Bethe Ansatz\\nwalkers fall into a category similar to the non-integrable walkers.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T12:56:06Z\"}"}
