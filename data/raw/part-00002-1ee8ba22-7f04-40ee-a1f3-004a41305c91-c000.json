{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07461v1\", \"title\": \"Achilles Heel of Distributed Multi-Agent Systems\", \"summary\": \"Multi-agent system (MAS) has demonstrated exceptional capabilities in\\naddressing complex challenges, largely due to the integration of multiple large\\nlanguage models (LLMs). However, the heterogeneity of LLMs, the scalability of\\nquantities of LLMs, and local computational constraints pose significant\\nchallenges to hosting these models locally. To address these issues, we propose\\na new framework termed Distributed Multi-Agent System (DMAS). In DMAS,\\nheterogeneous third-party agents function as service providers managed remotely\\nby a central MAS server and each agent offers its services through API\\ninterfaces. However, the distributed nature of DMAS introduces several concerns\\nabout trustworthiness. In this paper, we study the Achilles heel of distributed\\nmulti-agent systems, identifying four critical trustworthiness challenges: free\\nriding, susceptibility to malicious attacks, communication inefficiencies, and\\nsystem instability. Extensive experiments across seven frameworks and four\\ndatasets reveal significant vulnerabilities of the DMAS. These attack\\nstrategies can lead to a performance degradation of up to 80% and attain a 100%\\nsuccess rate in executing free riding and malicious attacks. We envision our\\nwork will serve as a useful red-teaming tool for evaluating future multi-agent\\nsystems and spark further research on trustworthiness challenges in distributed\\nmulti-agent systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MA\", \"categories\": \"cs.MA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T05:16:11Z\"}"}
