{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12989v1\", \"title\": \"Query Complexity of Classical and Quantum Channel Discrimination\", \"summary\": \"Quantum channel discrimination has been studied from an information-theoretic\\nperspective, wherein one is interested in the optimal decay rate of error\\nprobabilities as a function of the number of unknown channel accesses. In this\\npaper, we study the query complexity of quantum channel discrimination, wherein\\nthe goal is to determine the minimum number of channel uses needed to reach a\\ndesired error probability. To this end, we show that the query complexity of\\nbinary channel discrimination depends logarithmically on the inverse error\\nprobability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and\\nHolevo) channel fidelity. As a special case of these findings, we precisely\\ncharacterize the query complexity of discriminating between two classical\\nchannels. We also provide lower and upper bounds on the query complexity of\\nbinary asymmetric channel discrimination and multiple quantum channel\\ndiscrimination. For the former, the query complexity depends on the geometric\\nR\\\\'enyi and Petz R\\\\'enyi channel divergences, while for the latter, it depends\\non the negative logarithm of (geometric and Uhlmann) channel fidelity. For\\nmultiple channel discrimination, the upper bound scales as the logarithm of the\\nnumber of channels.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.IT,cs.LG,math.IT,math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T14:54:00Z\"}"}
