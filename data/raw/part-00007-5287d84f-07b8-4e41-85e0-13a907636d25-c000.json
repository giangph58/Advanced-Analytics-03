{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19623v1\", \"title\": \"Multi-Horizon Echo State Network Prediction of Intraday Stock Returns\", \"summary\": \"Stock return prediction is a problem that has received much attention in the\\nfinance literature. In recent years, sophisticated machine learning methods\\nhave been shown to perform significantly better than ''classical'' prediction\\ntechniques. One downside of these approaches is that they are often very\\nexpensive to implement, for both training and inference, because of their high\\ncomplexity. We propose a return prediction framework for intraday returns at\\nmultiple horizons based on Echo State Network (ESN) models, wherein a large\\nportion of parameters are drawn at random and never trained. We show that this\\napproach enjoys the benefits of recurrent neural network expressivity,\\ninherently efficient implementation, and strong forecasting performance.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.CP\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.CP,q-fin.ST\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T09:32:10Z\"}"}
