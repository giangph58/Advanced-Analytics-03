Here, we introduce NEP89, a foundation\\nmodel based on the neuroevolution potential (NEP) architecture, delivering\\nempirical-potential-like speed and high accuracy across 89 chemical elements. A\\ncompact yet comprehensive training dataset covering inorganic and organic\\nmaterials across 89 elements was curated through descriptor-space subsampling\\nand an iterative active-learning-like process applied to multiple datasets. We\\nrigorously evaluated NEP89's predictive performance against representative\\nfoundation models, demonstrating its reliability and competitive accuracy\\nacross diverse benchmark studies. NEP89 is 3-4 orders of magnitude more\\ncomputationally efficient than comparable models, enabling previously\\nimpractical large-scale atomistic simulations for both inorganic and organic\\nsystems. It also supports fine-tuning on small datasets, allowing rapid\\nadaptation to user-specific applications. This work marks a significant\\nadvancement in MLPs, enabling high-performance atomistic simulations across\\ndiverse research fields and communities.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T03:36:50Z\"}"}
