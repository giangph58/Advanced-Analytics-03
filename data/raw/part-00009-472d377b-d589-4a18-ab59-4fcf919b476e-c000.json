We extend the probabilistic circuit model (PCM) and implement an\\noptimization framework that targets both mid-circuit measurements and resets.\\nTo overcome the limitation of the prior PCM-based pass, where optimizations are\\nonly possible on pure single-qubit states, we incorporate circuit synthesis to\\nenable optimizations on multi-qubit states. With a parameter $n_{pcm}$, our\\nframework balances optimization level against resource usage.We evaluate our\\nframework using a large dataset of randomly generated dynamic circuits.\\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method is highly effective in\\nreducing mid-circuit measurements and resets. In our demonstrative example,\\nwhen applying our optimization framework to the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm\\nafter employing qubit reuse, we significantly reduce its runtime overhead by\\nremoving all of the resets.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.PL,cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T10:01:00Z\"}"}
