{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09958v1\", \"title\": \"C-MTCSD: A Chinese Multi-Turn Conversational Stance Detection Dataset\", \"summary\": \"Stance detection has become an essential tool for analyzing public\\ndiscussions on social media. Current methods face significant challenges,\\nparticularly in Chinese language processing and multi-turn conversational\\nanalysis. To address these limitations, we introduce C-MTCSD, the largest\\nChinese multi-turn conversational stance detection dataset, comprising 24,264\\ncarefully annotated instances from Sina Weibo, which is 4.2 times larger than\\nthe only prior Chinese conversational stance detection dataset. Our\\ncomprehensive evaluation using both traditional approaches and large language\\nmodels reveals the complexity of C-MTCSD: even state-of-the-art models achieve\\nonly 64.07% F1 score in the challenging zero-shot setting, while performance\\nconsistently degrades with increasing conversation depth. Traditional models\\nparticularly struggle with implicit stance detection, achieving below 50% F1\\nscore. This work establishes a challenging new benchmark for Chinese stance\\ndetection research, highlighting significant opportunities for future\\nimprovements.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T07:55:47Z\"}"}
