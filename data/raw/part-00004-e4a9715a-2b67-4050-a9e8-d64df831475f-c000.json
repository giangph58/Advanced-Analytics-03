{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01920v1\", \"title\": \"Integrated sub-terahertz cavity electro-optic transduction\", \"summary\": \"Emerging communications and computing technologies will rely ever-more on\\nexpanding the useful radio frequency (RF) spectrum into the sub-THz and THz\\nfrequency range. Both classical and quantum applications would benefit from\\nadvancing integration and incorporation of sub-THz and electro-optic\\ntechnologies into common devices, such as modulators. Here we demonstrate an\\nintegrated triply-resonant, superconducting electro-optic transducer. Our\\ndesign incorporates an on-chip $107$ GHz sub-THz niobium titanium nitride\\nsuperconducting resonator, modulating a thin-film lithium niobate optical\\nracetrack resonator operating at telecom wavelengths. We observe a maximum\\nphoton transduction efficiency of $\\\\eta_{\\\\text{OE}}\\\\approx 0.82\\\\times 10^{-6}$\\nand an average single-photon electro-optic interaction rate of $g_0/2\\\\pi\\\\approx\\n0.7$ kHz. We also present a study and analysis of the challenges associated\\nwith the design of integrated sub-THz resonators and propose possible solutions\\nto these challenges. Our work paves the way for further advancements in\\nresonant electro-optic technologies operating at sub-THz frequencies.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T17:29:53Z\"}"}
