We specialize on the case of a charged tagged particle interacting with\\na bath of charged oscillators, under an external AC electric field, although\\nthe results are much more general and can be applied to any type of external\\ntime-dependent fields. We derive the corresponding quantum Langevin equation,\\nwhich obeys a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation where the external\\nfield plays an explicit role. Using these results, we provide an illustration\\nof their usefulness and derive a new form of the quantum Nyquist noise for the\\nvoltage fluctuations in electrical circuits under AC conditions (finite\\nfrequency), which is the most general since it also accounts for the response\\nof the heat bath (e.g. lattice ions) to the applied AC electric field in the\\nGHz-THz region, of relevance for 5G/6G wireless technologies. This generalized\\nquantum fluctuation-dissipation relation for driven systems can also find other\\napplications ranging from quantum noise in quantum optics to quantum computing\\nwith trapped ions.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.stat-mech,physics.app-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:34:24Z\"}"}
