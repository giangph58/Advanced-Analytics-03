{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00505v1\", \"title\": \"Generically trivial torsors under constant groups\", \"summary\": \"We resolve the Grothendieck-Serre question over an arbitrary base field $k$:\\nfor a smooth $k$-group scheme $G$ and a smooth $k$-variety $X$, we show that\\nevery generically trivial $G$-torsor over $X$ trivializes Zariski semilocally\\non $X$. This was known when $G$ is reductive or when $k$ is perfect, and to\\nsettle it in general we uncover a wealth of new arithmetic phenomena over\\nimperfect $k$. We build our arguments on new purity theorems for torsors under\\npseudo-complete, pseudo-proper, and pseudo-finite $k$-groups, for instance,\\nrespectively, under wound unipotent $k$-groups, under pseudo-abelian varieties,\\nand under the kernels $\\\\mathrm{Ker}(i_G)$ of comparison maps $i_G$ that relate\\npseudo-reductive groups to restrictions of scalars of reductive groups. We then\\ndeduce an Auslander-Buchsbaum extension theorem for torsors under\\nquasi-reductive $k$-groups; for instance, we show that torsors over\\n$\\\\mathbb{A}^2_k \\\\setminus \\\\{(0,0)\\\\}$ under wound unipotent $k$-groups extend to\\ntorsors over $\\\\mathbb{A}^2_k$. For a quasi-reductive $k$-group $G$, this\\nextension theorem allows us to quickly classify $G$-torsors over\\n$\\\\mathbb{P}^1_k$ by an argument that already simplifies the reductive case and\\nto establish Birkhoff, Cartan, and Iwasawa decompositions for $G(k((t)))$. We\\ncombine these new results with deep inputs from recent work on the structure of\\npseudo-reductive and quasi-reductive $k$-groups to show an unramifiedness\\nstatement for the Whitehead group (the unstable $K_1$-group) of a\\nquasi-reductive $k$-group, and then use it to argue that, for a smooth\\n$k$-group $G$ and a semilocal $k$-algebra $A$, every $G$-torsor over\\n$\\\\mathbb{P}^1_A$ trivial at $\\\\{t = \\\\infty\\\\}$ is also trivial at $\\\\{t = 0\\\\}$,\\nwhich is known to imply the Grothendieck--Serre conclusion via geometric\\narguments. To achieve all this, we develop and heavily use the structure theory\\nof $k$-group schemes locally of finite type.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG,math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T13:22:37Z\"}"}
