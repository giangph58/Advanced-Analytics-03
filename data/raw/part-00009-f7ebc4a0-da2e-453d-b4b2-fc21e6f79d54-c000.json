{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14910v1\", \"title\": \"Erratic non-Hermitian skin localization\", \"summary\": \"A novel localization phenomenon, termed erratic non-Hermitian skin\\nlocalization, has been identified in disordered globally-reciprocal\\nnon-Hermitian lattices. Unlike conventional non-Hermitian skin effect and\\nAnderson localization, it features macroscopic eigenstate localization at\\nirregular, disorder-dependent positions with sub-exponential decay. Using the\\nHatano-Nelson model with disordered imaginary gauge fields as a case study,\\nthis effect is linked to stochastic interfaces governed by the universal order\\nstatistics of random walks. Finite-size scaling analysis confirms the localized\\nnature of the eigenstates. This discovery challenges conventional wave\\nlocalization paradigms, offering new avenues for understanding and controlling\\nlocalization phenomena in non-Hermitian physics.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn,physics.optics,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T07:27:59Z\"}"}
