I derive optimal contracts for the two cases in which the\\nmanage's salary and bonus are integrated into total team bonus or provided\\nseparately. I compare situations of having the manager distribute bonuses based\\non individual worker performance to the situation of equal bonus distribution\\nbased on overall team performance without a manager. Only a contract with a\\nmanager who receives a separate bonus is feasible for low discount factor.\\nMaking the manager to distribute the salary and bonus including himself is best\\nwith intermediate discount factor. Providing an equal bonus without a manager\\nis optimal with high discount factor.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.TH\", \"categories\": \"econ.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T02:43:06Z\"}"}
