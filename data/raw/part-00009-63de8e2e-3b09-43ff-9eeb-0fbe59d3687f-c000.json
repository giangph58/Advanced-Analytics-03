{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15638v1\", \"title\": \"A characteristic optical variability time scale in jetted active\\n  galactic nuclei: a large gamma-ray emission sample\", \"summary\": \"The variability mechanisms from jetted AGNs are still under debate. Here the\\ndamped random walk (DRW) model, implemented through Gaussian Processe (GPs), is\\nused to fit the $ZTF$ long-term optical light curves of 1684 $\\\\gamma$-ray\\nemission jetted AGNs. This analysis yields one of the largest samples with\\ncharacteristic optical variability timescales for jetted AGNs. A single DRW\\nmodel from GPs can fit the optical light curve of most jetted AGNs\\nwell/potentially well, while there are still some jetted AGNs whose light curve\\ncan not be fitted well by a single DRW model. After the jet power, proxied by\\ngamma-ray luminosity, is introduced as a new parameter, new relationships among\\nintrinsic variability time scales, black hole mass and jet power are discovered\\nfor efficient accretion AGNs ($\\\\tau^{\\\\rm in} \\\\propto M_{\\\\rm\\nBH}^{0.29^{+0.06}_{-0.06}}P_{\\\\rm jet}^{-0.3^{+0.03}_{-0.03}}$ with scatter of\\napproximately 0.09~dex) and for inefficient accretion AGNs ($\\\\tau^{\\\\rm in}\\n\\\\propto M_{\\\\rm BH}^{0.06^{+0.07}_{-0.07}}P_{\\\\rm jet}^{0.37^{+0.11}_{-0.11}}$\\nwith scatter of approximately 0.14~dex), respectively. Our results support that\\nthe optical variability of jetted AGNs with efficient accretion may originate\\nwithin the standard accretion disk at UV emitting radii similar to non-jetted\\nAGNs, and is directly related to the acceleration of shock in the jet and then\\nenhanced through the beaming effect in beamed AGNs. For the jetted AGNs with\\ninefficient accretion, the intrinsic timescale is consistent with the escape\\ntimescale of electrons.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T06:57:01Z\"}"}
