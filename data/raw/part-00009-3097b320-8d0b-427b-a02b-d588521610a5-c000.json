{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19526v1\", \"title\": \"Near-real-time flood inundation monitoring by Bayesian analysis for\\n  change point problems for Sentinel-1 time series\", \"summary\": \"Near real-time flood monitoring is crucial for disaster response, yet\\nexisting methods face significant limitations in training data requirements and\\ncloud cover interference. Here we present a novel approach using Bayesian\\nanalysis for change point problems (BCP) applied to Sentinel-1 SAR time series\\ndata, which automatically detects temporal discontinuities in backscatter\\npatterns to distinguish flood inundation from permanent water bodies without\\nrequiring training data or ancillary information. We validate our method using\\nthe UrbanSARFloods benchmark dataset across three diverse geographical contexts\\n(Weihui, China; Jubba, Somalia; and NovaKakhovka, Ukraine). Our BCP approach\\nachieves F1 scores ranging from 0.41 to 0.76 (IoU: 0.25-0.61), significantly\\noutperforming both OTSU thresholding (F1: 0.03-0.12, IoU: 0.02-0.08) and\\nSiamese convolutional neural network approaches (F1: 0.08-0.34, IoU:\\n0.05-0.24). Further analysis reveals exceptional performance in open areas with\\nF1 scores of 0.47-0.81 (IoU: 0.31-0.68) and high recall (0.36-0.84), contrasted\\nwith substantially lower performance in urban areas (F1: 0.00-0.01, IoU:\\n0.00-0.01), indicating a common challenge across current flood detection\\nmethods in urban environments. The proposed method's ability to process raw SAR\\ndata directly with minimal preprocessing enables integration into operational\\nearly warning systems for rapid flood mapping, particularly in agricultural and\\nopen landscapes where it demonstrates the strongest performance.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T07:05:38Z\"}"}
