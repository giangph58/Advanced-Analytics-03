We show how both tilt and\\ndisplacement cause OAM sidebands following the same function, with both having\\ntheir characteristic adimensional parameter related to the size and wavelength\\nof the beam. We see how an increase in topological charge on the beam causes\\nwider detected OAM distribution. Finally, we show how, in the case of both tilt\\nand lateral displacement, we can tune the amount of OAM mode in the original\\nmode by having a perpendicular direction for the tilt and off-axis\\ndisplacement, causing the misalignment errors to interfere destructively.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T13:28:32Z\"}"}
