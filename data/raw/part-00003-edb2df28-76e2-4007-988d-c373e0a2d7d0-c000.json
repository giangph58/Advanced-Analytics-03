We\\nperform direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations in rotating\\nframes, to investigate the spontaneous emergence of metastable vortex crystals.\\nWe analyze the energy spectrum, vortex morphology, and spatio-temporal dynamics\\nto understand their roles in crystal formation and evolution. In addition, we\\nexplore domains with varying aspect ratios to examine their impact on the\\nvortex lattice. Our results indicate a relationship between the crystal\\nlifespan and dissipation, and we propose a scaling law linking the rotation\\nrate, domain geometry, and vortex lattice periodicity. Finally, we identify a\\ncritical threshold in the control parameter, the Rossby number, suggesting a\\nbehavior similar to that found in phase transitions.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T03:30:30Z\"}"}
