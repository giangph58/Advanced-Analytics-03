{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11346v1\", \"title\": \"Seedream 3.0 Technical Report\", \"summary\": \"We present Seedream 3.0, a high-performance Chinese-English bilingual image\\ngeneration foundation model. We develop several technical improvements to\\naddress existing challenges in Seedream 2.0, including alignment with\\ncomplicated prompts, fine-grained typography generation, suboptimal visual\\naesthetics and fidelity, and limited image resolutions. Specifically, the\\nadvancements of Seedream 3.0 stem from improvements across the entire pipeline,\\nfrom data construction to model deployment. At the data stratum, we double the\\ndataset using a defect-aware training paradigm and a dual-axis collaborative\\ndata-sampling framework. Furthermore, we adopt several effective techniques\\nsuch as mixed-resolution training, cross-modality RoPE, representation\\nalignment loss, and resolution-aware timestep sampling in the pre-training\\nphase. During the post-training stage, we utilize diversified aesthetic\\ncaptions in SFT, and a VLM-based reward model with scaling, thereby achieving\\noutputs that well align with human preferences. Furthermore, Seedream 3.0\\npioneers a novel acceleration paradigm. By employing consistent noise\\nexpectation and importance-aware timestep sampling, we achieve a 4 to 8 times\\nspeedup while maintaining image quality. Seedream 3.0 demonstrates significant\\nimprovements over Seedream 2.0: it enhances overall capabilities, in particular\\nfor text-rendering in complicated Chinese characters which is important to\\nprofessional typography generation. In addition, it provides native\\nhigh-resolution output (up to 2K), allowing it to generate images with high\\nvisual quality.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:19:07Z\"}"}
