{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20736v1\", \"title\": \"A Survey on Event-based Optical Marker Systems\", \"summary\": \"The advent of event-based cameras, with their low latency, high dynamic\\nrange, and reduced power consumption, marked a significant change in robotic\\nvision and machine perception. In particular, the combination of these\\nneuromorphic sensors with widely-available passive or active optical markers\\n(e.g. AprilTags, arrays of blinking LEDs), has recently opened up a wide field\\nof possibilities. This survey paper provides a comprehensive review on\\nEvent-Based Optical Marker Systems (EBOMS). We analyze the basic principles and\\ntechnologies on which these systems are based, with a special focus on their\\nasynchronous operation and robustness against adverse lighting conditions. We\\nalso describe the most relevant applications of EBOMS, including object\\ndetection and tracking, pose estimation, and optical communication. The article\\nconcludes with a discussion of possible future research directions in this\\nrapidly-emerging and multidisciplinary field.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:21:03Z\"}"}
