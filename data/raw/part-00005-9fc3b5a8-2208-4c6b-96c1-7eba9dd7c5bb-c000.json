{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11367v1\", \"title\": \"Network Alignment\", \"summary\": \"Complex networks are frequently employed to model physical or virtual complex\\nsystems. When certain entities exist across multiple systems simultaneously,\\nunveiling their corresponding relationships across the networks becomes\\ncrucial. This problem, known as network alignment, holds significant\\nimportance. It enhances our understanding of complex system structures and\\nbehaviours, facilitates the validation and extension of theoretical physics\\nresearch about studying complex systems, and fosters diverse practical\\napplications across various fields. However, due to variations in the\\nstructure, characteristics, and properties of complex networks across different\\nfields, the study of network alignment is often isolated within each domain,\\nwith even the terminologies and concepts lacking uniformity. This review\\ncomprehensively summarizes the latest advancements in network alignment\\nresearch, focusing on analyzing network alignment characteristics and progress\\nin various domains such as social network analysis, bioinformatics,\\ncomputational linguistics and privacy protection. It provides a detailed\\nanalysis of various methods' implementation principles, processes, and\\nperformance differences, including structure consistency-based methods, network\\nembedding-based methods, and graph neural network-based (GNN-based) methods.\\nAdditionally, the methods for network alignment under different conditions,\\nsuch as in attributed networks, heterogeneous networks, directed networks, and\\ndynamic networks, are presented. Furthermore, the challenges and the open\\nissues for future studies are also discussed.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph,cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:32:09Z\"}"}
