{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21361v1\", \"title\": \"Zero-Shot Super-Resolution from Unstructured Data Using a\\n  Transformer-Based Neural Operator for Urban Micrometeorology\", \"summary\": \"This study demonstrates that a transformer-based neural operator (TNO) can\\nperform zero-shot super-resolution of two-dimensional temperature fields near\\nthe ground in urban areas. During training, super-resolution is performed from\\na horizontal resolution of 100 m to 20 m, while during testing, it is performed\\nfrom 100 m to a finer resolution of 5 m. This setting is referred to as\\nzero-shot, since no data with the target 5 m resolution are included in the\\ntraining dataset. The 20 m and 5 m resolution data were independently obtained\\nby dynamically downscaling the 100 m data using a physics-based\\nmicrometeorology model that resolves buildings. Compared to a convolutional\\nneural network, the TNO more accurately reproduces temperature distributions at\\n5 m resolution and reduces test errors by approximately 33%. Furthermore, the\\nTNO successfully performs zero-shot super-resolution even when trained with\\nunstructured data, in which grid points are randomly arranged. These results\\nsuggest that the TNO recognizes building shapes independently of grid point\\nlocations and adaptively infers the temperature fields induced by buildings.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T06:48:18Z\"}"}
