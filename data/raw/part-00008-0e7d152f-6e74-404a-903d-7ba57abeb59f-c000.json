{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15225v1\", \"title\": \"M$^2$AD: Multi-Sensor Multi-System Anomaly Detection through Global\\n  Scoring and Calibrated Thresholding\", \"summary\": \"With the widespread availability of sensor data across industrial and\\noperational systems, we frequently encounter heterogeneous time series from\\nmultiple systems. Anomaly detection is crucial for such systems to facilitate\\npredictive maintenance. However, most existing anomaly detection methods are\\ndesigned for either univariate or single-system multivariate data, making them\\ninsufficient for these complex scenarios. To address this, we introduce\\nM$^2$AD, a framework for unsupervised anomaly detection in multivariate time\\nseries data from multiple systems. M$^2$AD employs deep models to capture\\nexpected behavior under normal conditions, using the residuals as indicators of\\npotential anomalies. These residuals are then aggregated into a global anomaly\\nscore through a Gaussian Mixture Model and Gamma calibration. We theoretically\\ndemonstrate that this framework can effectively address heterogeneity and\\ndependencies across sensors and systems. Empirically, M$^2$AD outperforms\\nexisting methods in extensive evaluations by 21% on average, and its\\neffectiveness is demonstrated on a large-scale real-world case study on 130\\nassets in Amazon Fulfillment Centers.
