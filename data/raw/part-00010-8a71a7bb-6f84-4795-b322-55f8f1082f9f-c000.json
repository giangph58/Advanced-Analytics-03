In this paper, we consider the\\nmodified Smirnov operator, which carries a polynomial $P(z)$ into\\n$\\\\tilde{\\\\mathbb{S}}_a[P](z)=(1+az)P'(z)-naP(z),$ where $a$ is an arbitrary\\nnumber in $\\\\overline{\\\\mathbb{D}}$. We estimate minimum and maximum moduli of\\nmodified Smirnov operator of $P(z)$ on the unit circle with restricted zeros\\nand thereby obtain a generalization of some results of Dewan and Hans\\n\\\\cite{dewan2013some}. This study includes compact generalization of some\\nwell-known polynomial inequalities.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CV\", \"categories\": \"math.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T15:45:44Z\"}"}
