Its monoclinic structure features alternating\\nCu$^{2+}$ ($s$ = 1/2) monomers and edge-shared dimers linked by MoO$_{4}$\\nunits, forming a distorted diamond chain along the $a$-axis. Antiferromagnetic\\norder occurs at $T_{\\\\rm N}$ = 2.3 K, as evident from a $\\\\lambda$-type anomaly\\nin specific heat and magnetic susceptibility derivatives. Inverse magnetic\\nsusceptibility reveals coexisting ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions.\\nSpecific heat and ESR data show two characteristic temperatures: one at 20 K,\\nassociated with spin-singlet formation in Cu$_{2}$O$_{9}$ dimers, and another\\nat 3.68 K, indicating short-range correlations between dimers and monomers.\\nMagnetization measurements reveal a metamagnetic transition at 2.6 T and a\\ncritical magnetic field $\\\\mu_{0}H_{c}$ = 3.4 T, where a 1/3 magnetization\\nplateau emerges with saturation near 0.35 $\\\\mu_{\\\\rm B}$. Low-temperature\\nspecific heat and magnetization data reveal the suppression of long-range order\\nat $\\\\mu_{0}H_{c}$, enabling the construction of a temperature-magnetic field\\nphase diagram showing multiple magnetic phases near the $\\\\mu_{0}H_{c}$. Density\\nfunctional theory confirms a distorted diamond chain with $J_{1}$ dimers and\\ncompeting $J_2$, $J_4$, $J_3$, and $J_5$ interactions with monomer spins as an\\neffective low-temperature spin model.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T16:39:41Z\"}"}
