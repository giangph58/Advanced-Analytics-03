{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05075v1\", \"title\": \"Self-Replication of Turbulent Puffs: On the edge between chaotic saddles\", \"summary\": \"Pipe flow is a canonical example of a subcritical flow, the transition to\\nturbulence requiring a finite perturbation. The Reynolds number ($Re$) serves\\nas the control parameter for this transition, going from the ordered (laminar)\\nto the chaotic (turbulent) phase with increasing $Re$. Just above the critical\\n$Re$, where turbulence can be sustained indefinitely, turbulence spreads via\\nthe self-replication of localized turbulent structures called puffs. To reveal\\nthe workings behind this process, we consider transitions between one and\\ntwo-puff states, which dynamically are transitions between two distinct chaotic\\nsaddles. We use direct numerical simulations to explore the phase space\\nboundary between these saddles, adapting a bisection algorithm to identify an\\nattracting state on the boundary, termed an edge state. At $Re = 2200$, we also\\nexamine spontaneous transitions between the two saddles, demonstrating the\\nrelevance of the found edge state to puff self-replication. Our analysis\\nreveals that the process of self-replication follows a previously proposed\\nsplitting mechanism, with the found edge state as its tipping point.\\nAdditionally, we report results for lower values of $Re$, where the bisection\\nalgorithm yields a different type of edge state. As we cannot directly observe\\nsplits at this $Re$, the self-replication mechanism here remains an open\\nquestion. Our analysis suggests how this question could be addressed in future\\nstudies, and paves the way to probing the turbulence proliferation mechanism in\\nother subcritical flows.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn,nlin.CD\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T09:10:47Z\"}"}
