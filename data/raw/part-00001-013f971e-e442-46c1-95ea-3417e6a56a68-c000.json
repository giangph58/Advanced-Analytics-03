{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12103v1\", \"title\": \"Metric-Solver: Sliding Anchored Metric Depth Estimation from a Single\\n  Image\", \"summary\": \"Accurate and generalizable metric depth estimation is crucial for various\\ncomputer vision applications but remains challenging due to the diverse depth\\nscales encountered in indoor and outdoor environments. In this paper, we\\nintroduce Metric-Solver, a novel sliding anchor-based metric depth estimation\\nmethod that dynamically adapts to varying scene scales. Our approach leverages\\nan anchor-based representation, where a reference depth serves as an anchor to\\nseparate and normalize the scene depth into two components: scaled near-field\\ndepth and tapered far-field depth. The anchor acts as a normalization factor,\\nenabling the near-field depth to be normalized within a consistent range while\\nmapping far-field depth smoothly toward zero. Through this approach, any depth\\nfrom zero to infinity in the scene can be represented within a unified\\nrepresentation, effectively eliminating the need to manually account for scene\\nscale variations. More importantly, for the same scene, the anchor can slide\\nalong the depth axis, dynamically adjusting to different depth scales. A\\nsmaller anchor provides higher resolution in the near-field, improving depth\\nprecision for closer objects while a larger anchor improves depth estimation in\\nfar regions. This adaptability enables the model to handle depth predictions at\\nvarying distances and ensure strong generalization across datasets. Our design\\nenables a unified and adaptive depth representation across diverse\\nenvironments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Metric-Solver outperforms\\nexisting methods in both accuracy and cross-dataset generalization.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T14:12:25Z\"}"}
