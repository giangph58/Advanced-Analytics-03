{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05077v1\", \"title\": \"ReverbMiipher: Generative Speech Restoration meets Reverberation\\n  Characteristics Controllability\", \"summary\": \"Reverberation encodes spatial information regarding the acoustic source\\nenvironment, yet traditional Speech Restoration (SR) usually completely removes\\nreverberation. We propose ReverbMiipher, an SR model extending parametric\\nresynthesis framework, designed to denoise speech while preserving and enabling\\ncontrol over reverberation. ReverbMiipher incorporates a dedicated\\nReverbEncoder to extract a reverb feature vector from noisy input. This feature\\nconditions a vocoder to reconstruct the speech signal, removing noise while\\nretaining the original reverberation characteristics. A stochastic zero-vector\\nreplacement strategy during training ensures the feature specifically encodes\\nreverberation, disentangling it from other speech attributes. This learned\\nrepresentation facilitates reverberation control via techniques such as\\ninterpolation between features, replacement with features from other\\nutterances, or sampling from a latent space. Objective and subjective\\nevaluations confirm ReverbMiipher effectively preserves reverberation, removes\\nother artifacts, and outperforms the conventional two-stage SR and convolving\\nsimulated room impulse response approach. We further demonstrate its ability to\\ngenerate novel reverberation effects through feature manipulation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SD\", \"categories\": \"cs.SD,eess.AS\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T09:17:42Z\"}"}
