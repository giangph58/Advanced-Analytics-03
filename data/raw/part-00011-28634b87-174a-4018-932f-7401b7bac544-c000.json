The\\nbenchmark consists of an evaluation protocol, an open-source library for\\nassessing the performance of voice cloning models, and an accompanying\\nleaderboard. The paper discusses design considerations and presents a detailed\\ndescription of the evaluation procedure. The usage of the software library is\\nexplained, along with the organization of results on the leaderboard.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T09:36:33Z\"}"}
