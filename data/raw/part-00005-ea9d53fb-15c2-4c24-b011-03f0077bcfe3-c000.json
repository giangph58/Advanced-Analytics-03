The method combines the\\nwell-known $R$-matrix approach with the analysis based on the semi-analytic\\nrepresentation of the Jost functions. It is shown that such a combination has\\nthe advantages of both these approaches, namely, the number of the fitting\\nparameters remains relatively small (as for the $R$-matrix approach) and the\\nproper analytic structure of the $S$-matrix is preserved (as for the Jost\\nfunction method). It is also shown that the new formalism, although closely\\nrelated to the $R$-matrix method, has the benefit of no dependence on an\\narbitrary channel radius. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method\\nare tested using a model single-channel potential. Artificial ``experimental''\\ndata generated with this potential are fitted, and its known resonances are\\nsuccessfully recovered as zeros of the Jost function on the appropriate sheet\\nof the Riemann surface of the energy.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T12:29:57Z\"}"}
