However, traditional methods struggle\\nwith challenges such as data imbalance and feature redundancy in ship motion\\ndata, limiting their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose the\\nTemporal-Graph Contrastive Clustering Sea State Estimator (TGC-SSE), a novel\\ndeep learning model that combines three key components: a time dimension\\nfactorization module to reduce data redundancy, a dynamic graph-like learning\\nmodule to capture complex variable interactions, and a contrastive clustering\\nloss function to effectively manage class imbalance. Our experiments\\ndemonstrate that TGC-SSE significantly outperforms existing methods across 14\\npublic datasets, achieving the highest accuracy in 9 datasets, with a 20.79%\\nimprovement over EDI. Furthermore, in the field of sea state estimation,\\nTGC-SSE surpasses five benchmark methods and seven deep learning models.\\nAblation studies confirm the effectiveness of each module, demonstrating their\\nrespective roles in enhancing overall model performance. Overall, TGC-SSE not\\nonly improves the accuracy of sea state estimation but also exhibits strong\\ngeneralization capabilities, providing reliable support for autonomous vessel\\noperations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T07:22:11Z\"}"}
