{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00306v1\", \"title\": \"J-PARSE: Jacobian-based Projection Algorithm for Resolving Singularities\\n  Effectively in Inverse Kinematic Control of Serial Manipulators\", \"summary\": \"J-PARSE is a method for smooth first-order inverse kinematic control of a\\nserial manipulator near kinematic singularities. The commanded end-effector\\nvelocity is interpreted component-wise, according to the available mobility in\\neach dimension of the task space. First, a substitute \\\"Safety\\\" Jacobian matrix\\nis created, keeping the aspect ratio of the manipulability ellipsoid above a\\nthreshold value. The desired motion is then projected onto non-singular and\\nsingular directions, and the latter projection scaled down by a factor informed\\nby the threshold value. A right-inverse of the non-singular Safety Jacobian is\\napplied to the modified command. In the absence of joint limits and collisions,\\nthis ensures smooth transition into and out of low-rank poses, guaranteeing\\nasymptotic stability for target poses within the workspace, and stability for\\nthose outside. Velocity control with J-PARSE is benchmarked against the\\nLeast-Squares and Damped Least-Squares inversions of the Jacobian, and shows\\nhigh accuracy in reaching and leaving singular target poses. By expanding the\\navailable workspace of manipulators, the method finds applications in servoing,\\nteleoperation, and learning.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T04:58:50Z\"}"}
