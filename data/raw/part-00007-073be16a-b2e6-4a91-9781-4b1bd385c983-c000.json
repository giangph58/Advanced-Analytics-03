{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04464v1\", \"title\": \"Discriminative Ordering Through Ensemble Consensus\", \"summary\": \"Evaluating the performance of clustering models is a challenging task where\\nthe outcome depends on the definition of what constitutes a cluster. Due to\\nthis design, current existing metrics rarely handle multiple clustering models\\nwith diverse cluster definitions, nor do they comply with the integration of\\nconstraints when available. In this work, we take inspiration from consensus\\nclustering and assume that a set of clustering models is able to uncover hidden\\nstructures in the data. We propose to construct a discriminative ordering\\nthrough ensemble clustering based on the distance between the connectivity of a\\nclustering model and the consensus matrix. We first validate the proposed\\nmethod with synthetic scenarios, highlighting that the proposed score ranks the\\nmodels that best match the consensus first. We then show that this simple\\nranking score significantly outperforms other scoring methods when comparing\\nsets of different clustering algorithms that are not restricted to a fixed\\nnumber of clusters and is compatible with clustering constraints.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,G.3\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:35:39Z\"}"}
