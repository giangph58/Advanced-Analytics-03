This paper introduces a novel p-adaptive\\ndiscontinuous Galerkin method on polytopal grids (PolyDG) coupled with\\nCrank-Nicolson time integration to approximate such models efficiently. The\\np-adaptive method enhances local accuracy via dynamic, element-wise polynomial\\nrefinement/de-refinement guided by a-posteriori error estimators. A novel\\nclustering algorithm automatizes the selection of elements for adaptive\\nupdates, further improving efficiency. A wide set of numerical tests, including\\nepileptic seizure simulations in a sagittal section of a human brain stem,\\ndemonstrate the method's ability to reduce computational load while maintaining\\nthe accuracy of the numerical solution in capturing the dynamics of multiple\\nwavefronts.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:00:42Z\"}"}
