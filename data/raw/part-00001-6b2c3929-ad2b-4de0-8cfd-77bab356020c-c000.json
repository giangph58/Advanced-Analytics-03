{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03607v1\", \"title\": \"New Bounds and Truncation Boundaries for Importance Sampling\", \"summary\": \"Importance sampling (IS) is a technique that enables statistical estimation\\nof output performance at multiple input distributions from a single nominal\\ninput distribution. IS is commonly used in Monte Carlo simulation for variance\\nreduction and in machine learning applications for reusing historical data, but\\nits effectiveness can be challenging to quantify. In this work, we establish a\\nnew result showing the tightness of polynomial concentration bounds for\\nclassical IS likelihood ratio (LR) estimators in certain settings. Then, to\\naddress a practical statistical challenge that IS faces regarding potentially\\nhigh variance, we propose new truncation boundaries when using a truncated LR\\nestimator, for which we establish upper concentration bounds that imply an\\nexponential convergence rate. Simulation experiments illustrate the contrasting\\nconvergence rates of the various LR estimators and the effectiveness of the\\nnewly proposed truncation-boundary LR estimators for examples from finance and\\nmachine learning.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:06:22Z\"}"}
