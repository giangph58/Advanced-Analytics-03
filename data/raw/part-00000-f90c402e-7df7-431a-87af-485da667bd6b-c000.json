The independent random functions are observed\\non a discrete, random subset of design points, possibly with heteroscedastic\\nnoise. We propose a novel optimal-rate estimator based on Fourier series\\nexpansions and establish a sharp non-asymptotic error bound in $L^2-$norm.\\nAdditionally, we derive a non-asymptotic Gaussian approximation bound for our\\nestimated Fourier coefficients. Pointwise and uniform confidence sets are\\nconstructed. Our approach is made adaptive by a plug-in estimator for the\\nH\\\\\\\"older regularity of the mean function, for which we derive non-asymptotic\\nconcentration bounds.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.ME,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T09:50:00Z\"}"}
