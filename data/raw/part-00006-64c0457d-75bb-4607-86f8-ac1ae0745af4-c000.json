{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10240v1\", \"title\": \"GNN-ACLP: Graph Neural Networks based Analog Circuit Link Prediction\", \"summary\": \"Circuit link prediction identifying missing component connections from\\nincomplete netlists is crucial in automating analog circuit design. However,\\nexisting methods face three main challenges: 1) Insufficient use of topological\\npatterns in circuit graphs reduces prediction accuracy; 2) Data scarcity due to\\nthe complexity of annotations hinders model generalization; 3) Limited\\nadaptability to various netlist formats. We propose GNN-ACLP, a Graph Neural\\nNetworks (GNNs) based framework featuring three innovations to tackle these\\nchallenges. First, we introduce the SEAL (Subgraphs, Embeddings, and Attributes\\nfor Link Prediction) framework and achieve port-level accuracy in circuit link\\nprediction. Second, we propose Netlist Babel Fish, a netlist format conversion\\ntool leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language model\\n(LLM) to enhance the compatibility of netlist formats. Finally, we construct\\nSpiceNetlist, a comprehensive dataset that contains 775 annotated circuits\\nacross 10 different classes of components. The experimental results demonstrate\\nan improvement of 15.05% on the SpiceNetlist dataset and 12.01% on the\\nImage2Net dataset over the existing approach.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AR\", \"categories\": \"cs.AR,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T14:02:09Z\"}"}
