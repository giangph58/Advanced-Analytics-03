While the action of such channels on arbitrary\\nstates is well-characterized under full channel knowledge, we address the\\ninverse problem, namely, the precise estimation of fundamental channel\\nparameters, including the beam splitter transmissivity and the two-mode\\nsqueezing amplitude. Employing the quantum Fisher information (QFI) as a\\nbenchmark for metrological sensitivity, we demonstrate that the symmetry\\ninherent in mode mixing critically governs the amplification of QFI, thereby\\nenabling high-precision parameter estimation. In addition, we investigate\\nquantum thermometry by estimating the average photon number of thermal states,\\nrevealing that the transmissivity parameter significantly modulates estimation\\nprecision. Our results underscore the metrological utility of two-mode Gaussian\\nstates and establish a robust framework for parameter inference in noisy and\\ndynamically evolving quantum systems.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T11:12:23Z\"}"}
