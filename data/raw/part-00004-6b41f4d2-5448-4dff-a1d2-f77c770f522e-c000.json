In\\ncontrast, Bass77, AW95, Ngo80, and Guo2013 display larger deviations. The\\ninclusion of temperature dependence significantly improves the accuracy of\\nmodels such as Prox.77-3, Prox.77-6, and Prox.77-7. The -decay half-lives of 36\\npotential superheavy nuclei were further predicted using the five most accurate\\nproximity potential models and Ni's empirical formula, with the results\\naligning well with experimental data. These predictions underscore the high\\nreliability of the CPPM combined with proximity potential models in the\\ntheoretical calculation of {\\\\alpha}-decay half-lives of superheavy nuclei,\\noffering valuable theoretical insights for future experimental investigations\\nof superheavy nuclei.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T06:39:48Z\"}"}
