{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10275v1\", \"title\": \"LMFormer: Lane based Motion Prediction Transformer\", \"summary\": \"Motion prediction plays an important role in autonomous driving. This study\\npresents LMFormer, a lane-aware transformer network for trajectory prediction\\ntasks. In contrast to previous studies, our work provides a simple mechanism to\\ndynamically prioritize the lanes and shows that such a mechanism introduces\\nexplainability into the learning behavior of the network. Additionally,\\nLMFormer uses the lane connection information at intersections, lane merges,\\nand lane splits, in order to learn long-range dependency in lane structure.\\nMoreover, we also address the issue of refining the predicted trajectories and\\npropose an efficient method for iterative refinement through stacked\\ntransformer layers. For benchmarking, we evaluate LMFormer on the nuScenes\\ndataset and demonstrate that it achieves SOTA performance across multiple\\nmetrics. Furthermore, the Deep Scenario dataset is used to not only illustrate\\ncross-dataset network performance but also the unification capabilities of\\nLMFormer to train on multiple datasets and achieve better performance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T14:43:46Z\"}"}
