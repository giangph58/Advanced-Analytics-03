{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15857v1\", \"title\": \"Instability of oxide perovskite surfaces induced by vacancy formation\", \"summary\": \"This work presents a first principles study of the (001) surface energetics\\nof nine oxide perovskites, with a focus on the role of surface vacancies in\\ndetermining termination stability. Additionally, investigation into the\\nbehaviour of vacancies as a function of depth from the surface in these\\nperovskites, ABO$_{3}$ (A=Ca, Sr, Ba; B=Ti, Zr, Sn), is carried out, and\\nresults are compared to formation of the vacancies in bulk. Combining results\\nfrom these investigations reveals a general trend for all nine perovskites -\\nthe undefected AO surface is more energetically favourable to form than the BO2\\nsurface. This dominance of the AO over the BO2 surface is further enforced by\\nthe phase diagrams of perovskite surfaces. However, A-site vacancies at the AO\\nsurface are far more favourable (1-2 eV lower in energy) than B-site vacancies\\nat the BO2 surface. Charged vacancies only drive this further under oxygen-rich\\nconditions, showing a smaller range of stability for the AO than the BO2\\nsurface. These results indicates that, whilst the AO surface is easier to form,\\nthe BO2 surface will display better long term stability, making it more\\nsuitable for use in potential applications. This study furthers the\\nunderstanding of oxide perovskite (001)-terminated surface stability, which\\nwill aid in surface growth and manufacturing.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T12:53:37Z\"}"}
