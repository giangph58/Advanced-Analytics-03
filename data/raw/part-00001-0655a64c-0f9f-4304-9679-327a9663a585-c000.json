More specifically, we\\nfit Generalised Network Autoregressive (GNAR) Processes to a large set of\\nrandom networks generated according to the Erd\\\\H{o}s-R\\\\'enyi-Gilbert model and\\nselect the best-performing networks each month to compute out-of-sample\\nforecasts. RaGNAR significantly outperforms traditional benchmark models across\\nall horizons. Remarkably, RaGNAR also delivers materially more accurate\\npredictions than the Bank of Englan's four to six month inflation rate\\nforecasts published in their quarterly Monetary Policy Reports. Our results are\\nremarkable not only for their accuracy, but also because of their speed,\\nefficiency and simplicity compared to the Bank's current forecasting processes.\\nRaGNAR's performance improvements manifest both in terms of their root mean\\nsquared error and mean absolute percentage error, which measure different, but\\ncrucial, aspects of the methods' performance. GNAR processes demonstrably\\npredict future changes to CPI inflation more accurately and quickly than the\\nbenchmark models, especially at medium- to long-term forecast horizons, which\\nis of great importance to policymakers charged with setting interest rates. We\\nfind that the most robust forecasts are those which combine the predictions\\nfrom multiple GNAR processes via the use of various model averaging techniques.\\nBy analysing the structure of the best-performing graphs, we are also able to\\nidentify the key components that influence inflation rates during different\\nperiods.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T13:56:38Z\"}"}
