In addition, cyber-physical systems are often\\nconfronted with limited hardware resources or are legacy systems, both often\\nhindering the addition of new functionalities directly on the onboard hardware.\\nDigital Twins can be adopted to offload expensive computations, as well as\\nproviding support through fault tolerance mechanisms, thus decreasing costs and\\noperational downtime of cyber-physical systems. In this paper, we show the\\nfeasibility of a Digital Twin used for enhancing cyber-physical system\\noperations, specifically through functional augmentation and increased fault\\ntolerance, in an industry-oriented use case.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T11:12:58Z\"}"}
