The data were collected by\\nthe CMS experiment and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 1.68\\n$\\\\mu$b$^{-1}$. The $\\\\phi$(1020) meson signals are reconstructed via the\\nK$^+$K$^-$ decay channel. The production cross section is presented as a\\nfunction of the $\\\\phi$(1020) meson rapidity in the range 0.3 $\\\\lt$ $\\\\lvert\\ny\\\\rvert$ $\\\\lt$ 1.0, probing gluons that carry a fraction of the nucleon\\nmomentum ($x$) around $10^{-4}$. The observed cross section exhibits little\\ndependence on rapidity and is significantly suppressed, by a factor of\\n${\\\\sim}$5, compared to a baseline model that treats a nucleus as a collection\\nof free nucleons. Theoretical models that incorporate either nuclear shadowing\\nor gluon saturation predict suppression of the $\\\\phi$(1020) meson cross section\\nwith only a small dependence on rapidity, but the magnitude of the predicted\\nsuppression varies greatly. Models considering only nuclear shadowing effects\\nresult in the best agreement with the experimental data. This study establishes\\na powerful new tool for exploring nuclear effects and nuclear gluonic structure\\nin the small-$x$ regime at a unique energy scale bridging the perturbative and\\nnonperturbative quantum chromodynamics domains.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-ex\", \"categories\": \"nucl-ex,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T15:43:00Z\"}"}
