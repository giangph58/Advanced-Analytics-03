In this work, we present a GNSS-free global localization\\nsolution that contains a method of registering imaging radar on the ground with\\noverhead RGB imagery, with joint optimization of relative poses from odometry\\nand global poses from our overhead registration. Previous works have used\\nvarious combinations of ground sensors and overhead imagery, and different\\nfeature extraction and matching methods. These include various handcrafted and\\ndeep-learning-based methods for extracting features from overhead imagery. Our\\nwork presents insights on extracting essential features from RGB overhead\\nimages for effective global localization against overhead imagery using only\\nground radar and a single georeferenced initial guess. We motivate our method\\nby evaluating it on datasets in diverse geographic conditions and robotic\\nplatforms, including on an Unmanned Surface Vessel (USV) as well as urban and\\nsuburban driving datasets.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T13:41:04Z\"}"}
