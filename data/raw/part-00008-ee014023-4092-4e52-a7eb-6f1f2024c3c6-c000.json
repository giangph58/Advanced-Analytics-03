In the context of\\ngeneralized linear models (GLMs), where responses follow exponential family\\ndistributions, aggregation offers an attractive alternative to classical\\nparametric modeling. This paper investigates the problem of sparse aggregation\\nin GLMs, aiming to approximate the true parameter vector by a sparse linear\\ncombination of predictors. We prove that an exponential weighted aggregation\\nscheme yields a sharp oracle inequality for the Kullback-Leibler risk with\\nleading constant equal to one, while also attaining the minimax-optimal rate of\\naggregation. These results are further enhanced by establishing\\nhigh-probability bounds on the excess risk.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.ML,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T12:25:11Z\"}"}
