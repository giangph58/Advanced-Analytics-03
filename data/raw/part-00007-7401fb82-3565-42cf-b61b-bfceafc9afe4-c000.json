{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12995v1\", \"title\": \"Time-Varying Spectrum of the Random String\", \"summary\": \"We consider the response of a finite string to white noise and obtain the\\nexact time-dependent spectrum. The complete exact solution is obtained, that\\nis, both the transient and steady-state solution. To define the time-varying\\nspectrum we ensemble average the Wigner distribution. We obtain the exact\\nsolution by transforming the differential equation for the string into the\\nphase space differential equation of time and frequency and solve it directly.\\nWe also obtain the exact solution by an impulse response method which gives a\\ndifferent form of the solution. Also, we obtain the time-dependent variance of\\nthe process at each position. Limiting cases for small and large times are\\nobtained. As a special case we obtain the results of van Lear Jr. and Uhlenbeck\\nand Lyon. A numerical example is given and the results plotted.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.class-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.class-ph,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T15:04:00Z\"}"}
