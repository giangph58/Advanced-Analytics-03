{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02354v1\", \"title\": \"Improving turbulence control through explainable deep learning\", \"summary\": \"Turbulent-flow control aims to develop strategies that effectively manipulate\\nfluid systems, such as the reduction of drag in transportation and enhancing\\nenergy efficiency, both critical steps towards reducing global CO$_2$\\nemissions. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offers novel tools to discover\\nflow-control strategies, which we combine with our knowledge of the physics of\\nturbulence. We integrate explainable deep learning (XDL) to objectively\\nidentify the coherent structures containing the most informative regions in the\\nflow, with a DRL model trained to reduce them. The trained model targets the\\nmost relevant regions in the flow to sustain turbulence and produces a drag\\nreduction which is higher than that of a model specifically trained to reduce\\nthe drag, while using only half its power consumption. Moreover, the XDL model\\nresults in a better drag reduction than other models focusing on specific\\nclassically identified coherent structures. This demonstrates that combining\\nDRL with XDL can produce causal control strategies that precisely target the\\nmost influential features of turbulence. By directly addressing the core\\nmechanisms that sustain turbulence, our approach offers a powerful pathway\\ntowards its efficient control, which is a long-standing challenge in physics\\nwith profound implications for energy systems, climate modeling and\\naerodynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T07:42:47Z\"}"}
