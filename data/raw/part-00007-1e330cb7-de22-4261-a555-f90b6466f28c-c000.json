{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12745v1\", \"title\": \"3D MHD wave propagation and energy transport in a simulated solar vortex\", \"summary\": \"Magnetic flux tubes in the presence of background rotational flows are\\nabundant throughout the solar atmosphere and may act as conduits for MHD waves\\nto transport energy throughout the solar atmosphere. Here we investigate the\\ncontribution from MHD waves to the Poynting flux in a 3D numerical simulation\\nof a realistic solar atmosphere, modelling a structure resembling a solar\\nvortex tube, using the PLUTO code in the presence of different plasma flow\\nconfigurations. These simulations feature a closed magnetic loop system where a\\nrotational flow is imposed at one foot-point in addition to photospheric\\nperturbations acting as a wave driver mimicking those of p-modes. We find that\\na variety of MHD waves exist within the vortex tube, including sausage, kink\\nand torsional Alfv\\\\'{e}n waves, owing to the photospheric wave driver and the\\nnature of the rotational flow itself. We demonstrate how the visual\\ninterpretation of different MHD modes becomes non-trivial when a background\\nrotational flow is present compared to a static flux tube. By conducting a\\nsimulation both with and without the rotational plasma flow, we demonstrate how\\nthe perturbed Poynting flux increases in the presence of the rotational flow as\\nthe waves transport increased magnetic energy. We attribute this increase to\\nthe dynamical pressure from the rotational flow increasing the plasma density\\nat the tube boundary, which acts to trap the wave energy more effectively\\ninside the vortex. Moreover, we demonstrate how the Poynting flux is always\\ndirected upwards in weakly twisted magnetic flux tubes.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T08:36:31Z\"}"}
