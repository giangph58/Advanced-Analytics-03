{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21848v1\", \"title\": \"Characterizing AI Agents for Alignment and Governance\", \"summary\": \"The creation of effective governance mechanisms for AI agents requires a\\ndeeper understanding of their core properties and how these properties relate\\nto questions surrounding the deployment and operation of agents in the world.\\nThis paper provides a characterization of AI agents that focuses on four\\ndimensions: autonomy, efficacy, goal complexity, and generality. We propose\\ndifferent gradations for each dimension, and argue that each dimension raises\\nunique questions about the design, operation, and governance of these systems.\\nMoreover, we draw upon this framework to construct \\\"agentic profiles\\\" for\\ndifferent kinds of AI agents. These profiles help to illuminate cross-cutting\\ntechnical and non-technical governance challenges posed by different classes of\\nAI agents, ranging from narrow task-specific assistants to highly autonomous\\ngeneral-purpose systems. By mapping out key axes of variation and continuity,\\nthis framework provides developers, policymakers, and members of the public\\nwith the opportunity to develop governance approaches that better align with\\ncollective societal goals.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY,cs.AI,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:55:48Z\"}"}
