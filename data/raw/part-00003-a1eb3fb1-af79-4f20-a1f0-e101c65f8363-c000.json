We derive the corresponding robust estimator, referred to as\\nupdate-resilient Kalman filter, which appears to be novel compared to existing\\nminimax game-based filtering approaches. Moreover, we characterize the\\ncorresponding least favorable state space model and analyze the filter\\nstability. Finally, some numerical examples show the effectiveness of the\\nproposed estimator.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:26:48Z\"}"}
