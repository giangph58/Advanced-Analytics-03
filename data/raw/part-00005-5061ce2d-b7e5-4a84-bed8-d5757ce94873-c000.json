{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04327v1\", \"title\": \"Asymptotic Higher Spin Symmetries IV: Einstein-Yang-Mills Theory\", \"summary\": \"We generalize the analysis of the asymptotic higher spin symmetries developed\\nin the first three parts of this series by considering the minimal coupling of\\nEinstein Gravity and Yang-Mills theory. We show that there exist symmetry\\nparameters that satisfy a collection of dual equations of motion, which allow\\nthe construction of an infinite collection of charges that are conserved in the\\nabsence of radiation. These Noether charges act on the Einstein Yang-Mills\\nphase space canonically and non-linearly. Their action defines a symmetry\\nalgebroid which reduces to a symmetry algebra at non-radiative cuts and\\ngeneralizes the celestial $sw_{1+\\\\infty}$ algebra. The corresponding symmetry\\nbracket is shown to satisfy the Jacobi identity and an interesting\\ncross-product structure, which is analyzed in details.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T11:22:15Z\"}"}
