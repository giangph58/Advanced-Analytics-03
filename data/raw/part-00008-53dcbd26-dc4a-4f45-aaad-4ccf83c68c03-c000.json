{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15651v1\", \"title\": \"Atomically-Thin Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Nanolasers: Challenges\\n  and Opportunities\", \"summary\": \"Low energy consumption nanolasers are crucial for advancing on-chip\\nintegrated optical interconnects and photonic integrated circuits. Monolayer\\ntransition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as an energy-efficient\\nalternative to traditional semiconductor materials for nanolaser optical gain\\nmedium, promising ultralow lasing threshold powers. While several studies\\nsuggest that TMDs meet the criteria for lasing, whether true lasing has been\\nachieved remains a topic of heavy debate within the scientific community. In\\nthis perspective, we offer an overview of the field, outlining the key\\ncharacteristics of laser light and methods for testing these properties in\\nTMD-based devices. We then conduct a thorough review of recent reports claiming\\nlasing, assessing the findings against established criteria for laser light\\nemission. Finally, we discuss future research directions and applications,\\nhighlighting the key challenges that must be addressed to realize practical\\nTMD-based nanolasers.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T07:18:15Z\"}"}
