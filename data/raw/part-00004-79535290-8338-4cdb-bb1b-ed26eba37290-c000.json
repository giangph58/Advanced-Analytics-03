{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12879v1\", \"title\": \"Building Russian Benchmark for Evaluation of Information Retrieval\\n  Models\", \"summary\": \"We introduce RusBEIR, a comprehensive benchmark designed for zero-shot\\nevaluation of information retrieval (IR) models in the Russian language.\\nComprising 17 datasets from various domains, it integrates adapted, translated,\\nand newly created datasets, enabling systematic comparison of lexical and\\nneural models. Our study highlights the importance of preprocessing for lexical\\nmodels in morphologically rich languages and confirms BM25 as a strong baseline\\nfor full-document retrieval. Neural models, such as mE5-large and BGE-M3,\\ndemonstrate superior performance on most datasets, but face challenges with\\nlong-document retrieval due to input size constraints. RusBEIR offers a\\nunified, open-source framework that promotes research in Russian-language\\ninformation retrieval.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR,cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T12:11:14Z\"}"}
