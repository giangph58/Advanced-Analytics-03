{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20521v1\", \"title\": \"Quantifying the Influence of Climate on Storm Activity Using Machine\\n  Learning\", \"summary\": \"Extratropical storms shape midlatitude weather and vary due to both the\\nslowly evolving climate and the rapid changes in synoptic conditions. While the\\ninfluence of each factor has been studied extensively, their relative\\nimportance remains unclear. Here, we quantify the climate's relative importance\\nin both mean storm activity and individual storm development using 84 years of\\nERA-5 data and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We find that the\\nconstructed CNN model predicts more than 90% of the variability in the mean\\nstorm activity. However, a similar model predicts up to a third of the\\nvariability in individual storm features, such as intensity, growth time, and\\nstorm trajectory, showing their variability is dominated by synoptic\\nconditions. Isolating present-day climate change yields a signal-to-noise ratio\\n(SNR) of about 0.16% for storm-intensity attribution, whereas the SNR for heat\\nanomalies is ~50 times higher, highlighting that focusing on variables more\\ndirectly tied to warming provides a clearer attribution pathway.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T08:02:10Z\"}"}
