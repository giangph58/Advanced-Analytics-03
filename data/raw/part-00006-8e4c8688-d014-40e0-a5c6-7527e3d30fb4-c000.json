It has been proved sufficient for absolute\\ncontinuity in the domains with increasingly complex geometry, and known\\ncounterexamples show that in a certain sense it is necessary as well. In the\\npresent note, we introduce into the subject ideas from homogenization theory to\\nexhibit a new class of operators for which the elliptic measure is\\nwell-behaved, featuring the coefficients violating the DKP condition, and on\\nthe contrary, oscillating so quickly, that the homogenization takes place.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T09:35:14Z\"}"}
