{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11176v1\", \"title\": \"Wonderful Blow-Ups of Weighted Building Sets and Configuration Spaces of\\n  Filtered Manifolds\", \"summary\": \"Fulton and MacPherson famously constructed a configuration space that encodes\\ninfinitesimal collision data by blowing up the diagonals. We observe that when\\ngeneralizing their approach to configuration spaces of filtered manifolds (e.g.\\njet spaces or sub-Riemannian manifolds), these blow-ups have to be modified\\nwith weights in order for the collisions to be compatible with higher-order\\ndata.\\n  In the present article, we provide a general framework for blowing up\\narrangements of submanifolds that are equipped with a weighting in the sense of\\nLoizides and Meinrenken. We prove in particular smoothness of the blow-up under\\nreasonable assumptions, extending a result of Li to the weighted setting. Our\\ndiscussion covers both spherical and projective blow-ups, as well as the\\n(restricted) functoriality of the construction.\\n  Alongside a self-contained introduction to weightings, we also give a new\\ncharacterization thereof in terms of their vanishing ideals and prove that\\ncleanly intersecting weightings locally yield a weighting.\\n  As our main application, we construct configuration spaces of filtered\\nmanifolds, including convenient local models. We also discuss a variation of\\nthe construction tailored to certain fiber bundles equipped with a filtration.\\nThis is necessary for the special case of jet configuration spaces, which we\\ninvestigate in a future article.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG,math.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T13:31:47Z\"}"}
