{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10447v1\", \"title\": \"Quantum geometry from the Moyal product: quantum kinetic equation and\\n  non-linear response\", \"summary\": \"We systematically derive the dissipationless quantum kinetic equation for a\\nmulti-band free fermionic system with U(1) symmetry. Using the Moyal product\\nformalism, we fully band-diagonalize the dynamics. Expanding to the second\\norder in gradients, which is beyond the semiclassical limit, we give a complete\\nanalysis of the band-resolved thermodynamics and transport properties,\\nespecially those arising from the quantum geometric tensor. We apply our\\nframework to a Bloch band theory under electric fields near equilibrium and\\nfind the linear and nonlinear transport coefficients. We also obtain the\\ndynamical density-density response functions in the metallic case, including\\nquantum metric corrections. Our results and approach can be applied very\\ngenerally to multi-band problems even in situations with spatially varying\\nHamiltonians and distributions.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.stat-mech,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:37:09Z\"}"}
