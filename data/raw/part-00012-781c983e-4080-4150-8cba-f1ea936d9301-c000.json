{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17242v1\", \"title\": \"Rapid and Scalable Synthesis of Alkali Metal-Intercalated C$_{60}$\\n  Superconductors\", \"summary\": \"Alkali metal-intercalated C$_{60}$, $A_3$$C_{60}$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs, and their\\ncombinations), holds significant potential for practical applications due to\\nits high superconducting transition temperature (33 K), high upper critical\\nfield (900 kOe), and isotropic superconductivity. However, application-oriented\\nresearch has been limited by the lack of an efficient $A_3$$C_{60}$ synthesis\\nprocess. In this study, we demonstrate a rapid and scalable synthesis of\\n$A_3$$C_{60}$ ($A$ = K, Rb, and Cs$_{1/3}$Rb$_{2/3}$) via direct mixing of $A$\\nand C$_{60}$, realizing the fabrication of high-quality sintered $A_3$$C_{60}$\\npellets within just 1 hour of heating at 200-300{\\\\deg}C. The pellets exhibited\\nlarge superconducting shielding volume fractions with sharp transitions, and\\nthe relationship between the lattice constant and transition temperature was in\\ngood agreement with previous reports. This direct mixing method enables simple\\nand rapid production of large quantities of $A_3$$C_{60}$, which is expected to\\naccelerate research into applications such as superconducting wires and bulk\\nmagnets.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T04:30:22Z\"}"}
