Despite extensive historical observations, disentangling\\nthe contributions of internal and forced variability remains debated, largely\\ndue to the uncertain magnitude of anthropogenic aerosols.\\n  Here, we show that, after removing CO$_{2}$-congruent variability,\\nmultidecadal temperature variability in instrumental data is largely\\nattributable to internal processes of oceanic origin. This follows from an\\nemergent relationship, identified in historical climate model simulations,\\nbetween the driver of variability in oceanic regions and the land-ocean\\nvariance ratio in the mid-latitudes. Thus, climate models with higher residual\\n(non-CO$_{2}$) forced variability, largely linked to volcanic and anthropogenic\\naerosols, exhibit more spatially coherent and amplified temperature patterns\\nover land compared to observations. In contrast, models with higher internal\\nvariability agree better with the instrumental data. Our results underscore\\nthat internal modes of ocean-driven variability may be too weak in many climate\\nmodels, and that current projections may be underestimating the range of\\ninternal variability in regions with high oceanic influence.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T07:01:55Z\"}"}
