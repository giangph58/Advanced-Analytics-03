Scaling behavior, from small training instances to large test\\ninstances, is the key objective; and the use of validation instances larger\\nthan training instances is one key to achieve it. Prior work has used fixed\\nvalidation sets. Here, we introduce a method generating the validation set\\ndynamically, on the fly, increasing instance size so long as informative and\\nfeasible.We also introduce refined methodology for evaluating scaling behavior,\\ngenerating test instances systematically to guarantee a given confidence in\\ncoverage performance for each instance size. In experiments, dynamic validation\\nimproves scaling behavior of GNN policies in all 9 domains used.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T10:32:02Z\"}"}
