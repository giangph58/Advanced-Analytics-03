{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12763v1\", \"title\": \"Single Complex-Frequency Resonance Mode in an Engineered Disordered\\n  Time-Varying Cavity\", \"summary\": \"We propose a straightforward mechanism for achieving unique $k$-space\\nresonance modes in one-dimensional time-varying cavities where periodic\\ntemporal modulation creates momentum band gaps through Floquet dynamics. By\\nengineering the synergy between cavity resonance conditions and Floquet mode\\nformation in photonic time crystals, we demonstrate the emergence of a single\\ndominant momentum state that exhibits remarkable robustness against temporal\\ndisorder. Through analytical modeling and numerical verification, we show that\\nthe interplay between time-varying medium and cavity boundary conditions leads\\nto amplification of specific waves followed by spatial mode selection. This\\nengineered resonance mechanism enables insensitivity to initial wave source\\nconfiguration and strong temporal disorder immunity. Our findings give a simple\\nmechanism for exploiting narrow momentum bandgaps, and establish a foundation\\nfor developing high-quality temporal cavity lasers and advancing extreme\\ntemporal predictability in time-modulated systems.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,cond-mat.dis-nn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T09:00:32Z\"}"}
