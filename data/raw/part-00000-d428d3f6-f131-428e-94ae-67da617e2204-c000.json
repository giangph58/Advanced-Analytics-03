This wave is transverse electric and non-reciprocal, and its damping\\nrate can be lower than that of conventional 2d plasma waves. The Q-factor of 2d\\nTMW is independent of the wave vector. Numerical estimates show that in\\nstate-of-the-art two-dimensional electrons systems the 2d TMW Q-factor is the\\norder of $10^{-3}$. We discuss possible ways to overcome this issue.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:07:15Z\"}"}
