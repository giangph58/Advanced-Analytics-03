By integrating shadow tomography into the NOQE, the\\nmeasurement cost scales linearly rather than quadratically with the number of\\nreference states, while also reducing the required qubits and circuit depth by\\nhalf. This approach enables extraction of all matrix elements via randomized\\nmeasurements and classical postprocessing. We analyze its sample complexity and\\nshow that, for small systems, it remains constant in the high-precision regime,\\nwhile for larger systems, it scales linearly with the system size. We further\\napply shadow-based error mitigation to suppress noise-induced bias without\\nincreasing quantum resources. Demonstrations on the hydrogen molecule in the\\nstrongly correlated regime achieve chemical accuracy under realistic noise,\\nshowing that our method is both resource-efficient and noise-resilient for\\npractical quantum chemistry simulations in the near term.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T16:16:09Z\"}"}
