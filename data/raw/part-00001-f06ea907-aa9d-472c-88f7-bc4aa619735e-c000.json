We analyze the effects of\\nbit-flip, phase-flip, and amplitude damping noise on the multiparty QSS for\\nclassical message (QSSCM) and secret sharing of quantum information (SSQI)\\nprotocols proposed by Zhang et al. (Phys. Rev. A, 71:044301, 2005). To scale\\ndown these effects, we introduce an efficient quantum error correction (QEC)\\nscheme based on a simplified version of Shor's code. Leveraging the specific\\nstructure of the QSS protocols, we reduce the qubit overhead from the standard\\n9 of Shor's code to as few as 3 while still achieving lower average error rates\\nthan existing QEC methods. Thus, our approach can also be adopted for other\\nsingle-qubit-based quantum protocols. Simulations demonstrate that our approach\\nsignificantly enhances the protocols' resilience, improving their practicality\\nfor real-world deployment.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T13:40:06Z\"}"}
