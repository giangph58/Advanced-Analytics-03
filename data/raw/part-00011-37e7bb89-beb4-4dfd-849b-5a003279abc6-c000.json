{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07780v1\", \"title\": \"Interference-caged quantum many-body scars: the Fock space topological\\n  localization and interference zeros\", \"summary\": \"We propose a general mechanism for realizing athermal finite-energy-density\\neigenstates -- termed interference-caged quantum many-body scars (ICQMBS) --\\nwhich originate from exact many-body destructive interference on the Fock space\\ngraph. These eigenstates are strictly localized to specific subsets of\\nvertices, analogous to compact localized states in flat-band systems. Central\\nto our framework is a connection between interference zeros and graph\\nautomorphisms, which classify vertices according to the graph's local topology.\\nThis connection enables the construction of a new class of topological ICQMBS,\\nwhose robustness arises from the local topology of the Fock space graph rather\\nthan from conventional conservation laws or dynamical constraints. We\\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of this framework by developing a\\ngraph-theory-based search algorithm, which identifies ICQMBS in both a\\none-dimensional spin-1 XY model and two-dimensional quantum link models across\\ndistinct gauge sectors. In particular, we discover the proposed topological\\nICQMBS in the two-dimensional quantum link model and provide an intuitive\\nexplanation for previously observed order-by-disorder phenomena in Hilbert\\nspace. Our results reveal an unexpected synergy between graph theory, flat-band\\nphysics, and quantum many-body dynamics, offering new insights into the\\nstructure and stability of nonthermal eigenstates.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.other\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:18:34Z\"}"}
