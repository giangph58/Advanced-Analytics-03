{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06177v1\", \"title\": \"Hydroxide Mobility in Aqueous Systems: Ab Initio Accuracy with\\n  Millisecond Timescales\", \"summary\": \"We present a multiscale simulation approach for hydroxide transport in\\naqueous solutions of potassium hydroxide, combining ab initio molecular\\ndynamics (AIMD) simulations with force field ensemble averaging and lattice\\nMonte Carlo techniques. This method achieves near ab initio accuracy by\\ncapturing the femtosecond scale dielectric relaxation dynamics of the aqueous\\nhydrogen bonding network, while extending the simulation capability to\\nmillisecond diffusion timescales. This extraordinary extension of the available\\nlength and time scales enables future studies of hydroxide mobility in\\nfunctional materials such as nanostructured anion-exchange membranes, where\\nhydroxide ions migrate through nanometer-sized channels. Remarkably, our\\napproach demonstrates that a single AIMD trajectory is sufficient to predict\\nhydroxide conductivity over a range of concentrations, underscoring its\\ncomputational efficiency and relevance to the design of advanced energy\\nmaterials.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.comp-ph,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T16:19:46Z\"}"}
