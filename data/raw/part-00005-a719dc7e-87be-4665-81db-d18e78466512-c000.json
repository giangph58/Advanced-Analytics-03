While there is an obvious integrability of the magnetic system in\\n$\\\\mathbb R^n$, the integrability of the system restricted to the sphere\\n$S^{n-1}$ is highly non-trivial. We prove complete integrability of the\\nobtained restricted magnetic systems for $n\\\\le 6$. The first integrals of\\nmotion of the magnetic flows on the spheres $S^{n-1}$, for $n=5$ and $n=6$, are\\npolynomials of the degree $1$, $2$, and $3$ in momenta. We prove noncommutative\\nintegrability of the obtained magnetic flows for any $n\\\\ge 7$ when the systems\\nallow a reduction to the cases with $n\\\\le 6$. We conjecture that the restricted\\nmagnetic systems on $S^{n-1}$ are integrable for all $n$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG,nlin.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T07:57:34Z\"}"}
