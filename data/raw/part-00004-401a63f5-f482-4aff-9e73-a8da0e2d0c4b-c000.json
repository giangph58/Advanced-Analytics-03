We prove that the pullback by the Kodaira embedding associated to\\n$L^p\\\\otimes E$ of the $k$-th Chern class of the dual of the universal bundle\\nover the Grassmannian converges as $p\\\\to\\\\infty$ to the $k$-th power of the\\nChern form $c_1(L,h^L)$, for $0\\\\leq k\\\\leq r$. If $c_1(L,h^L)=\\\\omega$ we also\\ndetermine the second term in the semiclassical expansion, which involves\\n$c_1(E,h^E)$. As a consequence we show that the limit distribution of zeros of\\nrandom sequences of holomorphic sections of high powers $L^p\\\\otimes E$ is\\n$c_1(L,h^L)^r$. Furthermore, we compute the expectation of the currents of\\nintegration along degeneracy sets of random holomorphic sections.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CV\", \"categories\": \"math.CV,math.DG,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T12:29:42Z\"}"}
