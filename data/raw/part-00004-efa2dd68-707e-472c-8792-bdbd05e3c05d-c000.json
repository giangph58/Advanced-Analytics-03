{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16388v1\", \"title\": \"Measurement of the Temperature Dependence of the Refractive Index of\\n  CdZnTe\", \"summary\": \"We have been developing a CdZnTe immersion grating for a compact\\nhigh-dispersion mid-infrared spectrometer (wavelength range 10--18 $\\\\mu$m,\\nspectral resolution $R = \\\\lambda/\\\\Delta \\\\lambda > 25,000$, operating\\ntemperature $T < 20$ K). Using an immersion grating, the spectrometer size can\\nbe reduced to $1/n$ ($n$: refractive index) compared to conventional\\ndiffraction gratings. CdZnTe is promising as a material for immersion gratings\\nfor the wavelength range. However, the refractive index $n$ of CdZnTe has not\\nbeen measured at $T < 20$ K.\\n  We have been developing a system to precisely measure $n$ at cryogenic\\ntemperatures ($T \\\\sim 10$ K) in the mid-infrared wavelength range. As the first\\nresult, this paper reports the temperature dependence of $n$ of CdZnTe at the\\nwavelength of 10.68 $\\\\mu$m. This system employs the minimum deviation method.\\nThe refractive index $n$ of CdZnTe is measured at temperatures of \\\\( T = 12.57,\\n22.47, 50.59, 70.57, \\\\text{ and } 298 \\\\, \\\\text{K} \\\\).
