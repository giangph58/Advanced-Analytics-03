This coupling results in the\\nscattering of longitudinal phonons to transverse phonons and backwards. We show\\nthat the decay rate of longitudinal phonons due to this scattering scales with\\ntheir frequencies as $\\\\omega^{3/2}$ within the long wavelength limit ($\\\\omega\\n\\\\rightarrow 0$), which is more efficient scattering compared to the\\ntraditionally considered Rayleigh scattering within the longitudinal band\\n($\\\\omega^2$). This scattering results in temperature independent thermal\\nconductivity depending on the size as $\\\\kappa \\\\propto L^{1/3}$ for sufficiently\\nlong materials. This predicted length dependence is observed in nanowires,\\nthough the temperature dependence is seen there possibly because of deviations\\nfrom pure one-dimensional behavior. The significant effect of interaction of\\nlongitudinal phonons with transverse phonons is consistent with the earlier\\nobservations of a substantial suppression of thermal energy transport by kinks,\\nobviously leading to such interaction, though anharmonic interaction can also\\nbe significant.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph,cond-mat.dis-nn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T03:08:54Z\"}"}
