{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06138v1\", \"title\": \"A Multimedia Analytics Model for the Foundation Model Era\", \"summary\": \"The rapid advances in Foundation Models and agentic Artificial Intelligence\\nare transforming multimedia analytics by enabling richer, more sophisticated\\ninteractions between humans and analytical systems. Existing conceptual models\\nfor visual and multimedia analytics, however, do not adequately capture the\\ncomplexity introduced by these powerful AI paradigms. To bridge this gap, we\\npropose a comprehensive multimedia analytics model specifically designed for\\nthe foundation model era. Building upon established frameworks from visual\\nanalytics, multimedia analytics, knowledge generation, analytic task\\ndefinition, mixed-initiative guidance, and human-in-the-loop reinforcement\\nlearning, our model emphasizes integrated human-AI teaming based on visual\\nanalytics agents from both technical and conceptual perspectives. Central to\\nthe model is a seamless, yet explicitly separable, interaction channel between\\nexpert users and semi-autonomous analytical processes, ensuring continuous\\nalignment between user intent and AI behavior. The model addresses practical\\nchallenges in sensitive domains such as intelligence analysis, investigative\\njournalism, and other fields handling complex, high-stakes data. We illustrate\\nthrough detailed case studies how our model facilitates deeper understanding\\nand targeted improvement of multimedia analytics solutions. By explicitly\\ncapturing how expert users can optimally interact with and guide AI-powered\\nmultimedia analytics systems, our conceptual framework sets a clear direction\\nfor system design, comparison, and future research.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MM\", \"categories\": \"cs.MM,cs.AI,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T15:35:59Z\"}"}
