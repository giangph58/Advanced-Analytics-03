In the reaction, three ultracold atoms\\ncollide to form a diatomic molecule. This product molecule can be produced in\\nvarious internal states, characterizing the different product channels of the\\nreaction. Our scheme relies on the coupling between two such product channels\\nat an avoided molecular energy level crossing in the presence of an external\\nmagnetic field. The degree of coupling can be set by the magnetic field\\nstrength and allows for a widely tunable flux control between the two channels.\\nThis scheme is quite general and also holds great promise for a large variety\\nof chemical processes with diverse species, since molecular energy level\\ncrossings are ubiquitous in molecular systems and are often easily accessible\\nby standard laboratory equipment.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph,cond-mat.quant-gas,physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T15:19:08Z\"}"}
