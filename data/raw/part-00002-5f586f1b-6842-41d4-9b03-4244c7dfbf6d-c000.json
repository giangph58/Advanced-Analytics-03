Among the described theoretical results is a discussion of the\\nspectrum, a classification of all examples satisfying certain parameter\\nrestrictions or having at most three eigenvalues, a discussion of the structure\\nof the improper and the disconnected examples, and a procedure called dual\\nSeidel switching which allows to construct new examples of LDDG's from others.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:05:35Z\"}"}
