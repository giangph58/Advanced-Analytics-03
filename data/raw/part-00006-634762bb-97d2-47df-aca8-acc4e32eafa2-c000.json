We precisely explain\\nhow the Pythagorean theorem in $L^2(\\\\mathbb{R}^d,\\\\mathbb{R}^d)$ allows to get\\nthe proper energy estimate; however such an argument does not work anymore in\\n$L^p(\\\\mathbb{R}^d,\\\\mathbb{R}^d)$, $p \\\\neq 2$. We also deduce, by similar\\narguments, an already known $L^\\\\infty ([0,T],L^1(\\\\mathbb{R}^3,\\\\mathbb{R}^3))$\\ncontrol of vorticity for $d=3$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T07:47:35Z\"}"}
