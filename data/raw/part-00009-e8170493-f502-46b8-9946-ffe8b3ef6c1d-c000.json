{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07427v1\", \"title\": \"Deep Learning-Based Wideband Spectrum Sensing with Dual-Representation\\n  Inputs and Subband Shuffling Augmentation\", \"summary\": \"The widespread adoption of mobile communication technology has led to a\\nsevere shortage of spectrum resources, driving the development of cognitive\\nradio technologies aimed at improving spectrum utilization, with spectrum\\nsensing being the key enabler. This paper presents a novel deep learning-based\\nwideband spectrum sensing framework that leverages multi-taper power spectral\\ninputs to achieve high-precision and sample-efficient sensing. To enhance\\nsensing accuracy, we incorporate a feature fusion strategy that combines\\nmultiple power spectrum representations. To tackle the challenge of limited\\nsample sizes, we propose two data augmentation techniques designed to expand\\nthe training set and improve the network's detection probability. Comprehensive\\nsimulation results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches,\\nparticularly in low signal-to-noise ratio conditions, achieving higher\\ndetection probabilities and lower false alarm rates. The method also exhibits\\nstrong robustness across various scenarios, highlighting its significant\\npotential for practical applications in wireless communication systems.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T03:38:15Z\"}"}
