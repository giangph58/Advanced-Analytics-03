{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04366v1\", \"title\": \"Improved bounds on the zeros of the chromatic polynomial of graphs and\\n  claw-free graphs\", \"summary\": \"We prove that for any graph $G$ the (complex) zeros of its chromatic\\npolynomial, $\\\\chi_G(x)$, lie inside the disk centered at $0$ of radius $4.25\\n\\\\Delta(G)$, where $\\\\Delta(G)$ denote the maximum degree of $G$. This improves\\non a recent result of Jenssen, Patel and the second author, who proved a bound\\nof $5.94\\\\Delta(G)$. We moreover show that for graphs of sufficiently large\\ngirth we can replace $4.25$ by $3.60$ and for claw-free graphs we can replace\\n$4.25$ by $3.81$.\\n  Our proofs build on the ideas developed by Jenssen, Patel and the second\\nauthor, adding some new ideas. A key novel ingredient for claw-free graphs is\\nto use a representation of the coefficients of the chromatic polynomial in\\nterms of the number of certain partial acyclic orientations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,cs.DM,cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T12:34:30Z\"}"}
