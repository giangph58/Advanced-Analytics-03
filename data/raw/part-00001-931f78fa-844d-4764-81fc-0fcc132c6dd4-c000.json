Similar to threshold-dependent complex contagions, the\\nnonlinearity in adoption rates poses challenges for mean-field approximations.\\nTo address this theoretical gap, we focus on nonlinear binary-opinion dynamics\\non dynamical networks and analytically derive local configurations,\\nspecifically the distribution of opinions within any given focal individual's\\nneighborhood. This exact local configuration of opinions, combined with network\\ndegree distributions, allows us to obtain exact solutions for consensus times\\nand evolutionary trajectories. Our counterintuitive results reveal that neither\\nbiased assimilation (i.e., nonlinear adoption rates) nor preferences in local\\nnetwork rewiring -- such as in-group bias (preferring like-minded individuals)\\nand the Matthew effect (preferring social hubs) -- can significantly slow down\\nconsensus. Among these three social factors, we find that biased assimilation\\nis the most influential in accelerating consensus. Furthermore, our analytical\\nmethod efficiently and precisely predicts the evolutionary trajectories of\\nadoption curves arising from nonlinear contagion dynamics. Our work paves the\\nway for enabling analytical predictions for general nonlinear contagion\\ndynamics beyond opinion formation.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph,nlin.AO,q-bio.PE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T06:02:05Z\"}"}
