One would expect the number of primes in each invertible\\nresidue class mod $q$ to be multinomially distributed, i.e. for each $p\\n\\\\,\\\\mathrm{mod}\\\\, q$ to behave like an independent random variable uniform on\\n$(\\\\mathbb{Z}/q\\\\mathbb{Z})^\\\\times$. Using techniques from data science, we\\ndiscover overwhelming evidence to the contrary: primes are much more uniformly\\ndistributed than iid uniform random variables. This phenomenon was previously\\nunknown, and there is no clear theoretical explanation for it.\\n  To demonstrate that our test statistic of choice, the KL divergence, is\\nindeed extreme, we prove new bounds for the left tail of the relative entropy\\nof the uniform multinomial using the method of types.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT,cs.IT,math.IT,math.PR,math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T12:15:00Z\"}"}
