{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12181v1\", \"title\": \"Battery-aware Cyclic Scheduling in Energy-harvesting Federated Learning\", \"summary\": \"Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising framework for distributed\\nlearning, but its growing complexity has led to significant energy consumption,\\nparticularly from computations on the client side. This challenge is especially\\ncritical in energy-harvesting FL (EHFL) systems, where device availability\\nfluctuates due to limited and time-varying energy resources. We propose\\nFedBacys, a battery-aware FL framework that introduces cyclic client\\nparticipation based on users' battery levels to cope with these issues.\\nFedBacys enables clients to save energy and strategically perform local\\ntraining just before their designated transmission time by clustering clients\\nand scheduling their involvement sequentially. This design minimizes redundant\\ncomputation, reduces system-wide energy usage, and improves learning stability.\\nOur experiments demonstrate that FedBacys outperforms existing approaches in\\nterms of energy efficiency and performance consistency, exhibiting robustness\\neven under non-i.i.d. training data distributions and with very infrequent\\nbattery charging. This work presents the first comprehensive evaluation of\\ncyclic client participation in EHFL, incorporating both communication and\\ncomputation costs into a unified, resource-aware scheduling strategy.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T15:38:38Z\"}"}
