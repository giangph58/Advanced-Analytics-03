{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00521v1\", \"title\": \"$(S_2)$-ifications, semi-Nagata rings, and the lifting problem\", \"summary\": \"This is a two-part article. In the first part, we study an alternative notion\\nto Nagata rings. A Nagata ring is a Noetherian ring $R$ such that every finite\\n$R$-algebra that is an integral domain has finite normalization. We replace the\\nnormalization by an $(S_2)$-ification, study new phenomena, and prove parallel\\nresults. In particular, we show a Nagata domain has a finite $(S_2)$-ification.\\nIn the second part, we study the local lifting problem. We show that for a\\nsemilocal Noetherian ring $R$ that is $I$-adically complete for an ideal $I$,\\nif $R/I$ has $(S_k)$ (resp. Cohen--Macaulay, Gorenstein, lci) formal fibers, so\\ndoes $R$. As a consequence, we show if $R/I$ is a quotient of a Cohen--Macaulay\\nring, so is $R$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AC\", \"categories\": \"math.AC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T13:43:41Z\"}"}
