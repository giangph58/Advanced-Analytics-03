On the one hand, there are the implicit effects from the\\nin-box values of the nucleon and Delta-isobar masses. On the other hand, there\\nare the explicit effects caused by computing the in-box loop integrals with the\\nvalues of the nucleon and Delta-isobar masses obtained in the infinite-volume\\nlimit. Selected numerical results are shown for three lattice ensembles. We\\nshow that the implicit effects dominate the in-box form factor. Our results are\\npresented in terms of a set of basis functions that generalize the\\nPassarino-Veltman reduction scheme to the finite-box case, such that only\\nscalar loop integrals have to be performed. The techniques we developed are\\nmore generally relevant for lattice studies of hadronic quantities.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-lat\", \"categories\": \"hep-lat,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T09:26:30Z\"}"}
