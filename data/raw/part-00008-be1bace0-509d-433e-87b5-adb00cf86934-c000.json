{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20939v1\", \"title\": \"Flexible Semantic-Aware Resource Allocation: Serving More Users Through\\n  Similarity Range Constraints\", \"summary\": \"Semantic communication (SemCom) aims to enhance the resource efficiency of\\nnext-generation networks by transmitting the underlying meaning of messages,\\nfocusing on information relevant to the end user. Existing literature on SemCom\\nprimarily emphasizes learning the encoder and decoder through end-to-end deep\\nlearning frameworks, with the objective of minimizing a task-specific semantic\\nloss function. Beyond its influence on the physical and application layer\\ndesign, semantic variability across users in multi-user systems enables the\\ndesign of resource allocation schemes that incorporate user-specific semantic\\nrequirements. To this end, \\\\emph{a semantic-aware resource allocation} scheme\\nis proposed with the objective of maximizing transmission and semantic\\nreliability, ultimately increasing the number of users whose semantic\\nrequirements are met. The resulting resource allocation problem is a non-convex\\nmixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which is known to be NP-hard. To make\\nthe problem tractable, it is decomposed into a set of sub-problems, each of\\nwhich is efficiently solved via geometric programming techniques. Finally,\\nsimulations demonstrate that the proposed method improves user satisfaction by\\nup to $17.1\\\\%$ compared to state of the art methods based on quality of\\nexperience-aware SemCom methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI,eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:04:48Z\"}"}
