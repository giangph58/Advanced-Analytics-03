We refer to the corresponding potentials\\nas $\\\\delta'_\\\\theta$-combs, where the parameter $\\\\theta$ represents the contrast\\nof the resonant wave at zero energy and determines the interface conditions in\\nthe Hamiltonians. We explicitly calculate the scattering matrix for these\\nsystems and prove that the transmission probability exhibits sharp resonance\\npeaks while rapidly decaying at other frequencies. Consequently, Hamiltonians\\nwith $\\\\delta'_\\\\theta$-comb potentials act as quantum filters, permitting\\ntunnelling only for specific wave frequencies.\", \"main_category\": \"math.SP\", \"categories\": \"math.SP,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T08:33:37Z\"}"}
