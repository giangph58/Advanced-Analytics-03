{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05244v1\", \"title\": \"Three dimensional seepage analysis using a polyhedral scaled boundary\\n  finite element method\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents a novel polyhedral scaled boundary finite element method\\n(PSBFEM) for three-dimensional seepage analysis. The proposed method combines\\nthe semi-analytical capabilities of the SBFEM with the geometric flexibility of\\npolyhedral and octree meshes, making it well-suited for complex seepage\\nproblems. Wachspress shape functions are employed to construct shape functions\\nover arbitrary polyhedral elements, enabling accurate approximation along\\ncomplex boundaries. The method is implemented within the ABAQUS UEL framework\\nto support steady-state, transient, and free-surface seepage simulations. A\\nseries of numerical examples are provided to verify the accuracy, efficiency,\\nand convergence of the proposed method, including benchmark problems and\\ngeometrically complex domains. The results demonstrate that the PSBFEM achieves\\nhigher accuracy and faster convergence compared to conventional FEM,\\nparticularly when using hybrid octree meshes with localized refinement. This\\nframework provides a robust and efficient tool for 3D seepage analysis in\\ngeotechnical and hydraulic engineering applications.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:42:01Z\"}"}
