{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17705v1\", \"title\": \"LUIDA: Large-scale Unified Infrastructure for Digital Assessments based\\n  on Commercial Metaverse Platform\", \"summary\": \"Online experiments using metaverse platforms have gained significant traction\\nin Human-Computer Interaction and Virtual Reality (VR) research. However,\\ncurrent research workflows are highly fragmented, as researchers must use\\nseparate tools for system implementation, participant recruitment, experiment\\nexecution, and data collection, reducing consistency and increasing workload.\\nWe present LUIDA (Large-scale Unified Infrastructure for Digital Assessments),\\na metaverse-based framework that integrates these fragmented processes. LUIDA\\nautomatically allocates interconnected virtual environments for parallel\\nexperiment execution and provides implementation templates adaptable to various\\nVR research domains, requiring minimal metaverse development expertise. Our\\nevaluation included two studies using a prototype built on Cluster, the\\ncommercial metaverse platform. First, VR researchers using LUIDA to develop and\\nrun experiments reported high usability scores (SUS: 73.75) and moderate\\nworkload (NASA-TLX: 24.11) for overall usage, with interviews confirming\\nstreamlined workflows compared to traditional laboratory experiments. Second,\\nwe conducted three replicated experiments with public Cluster users, each\\nrecruiting approximately 200 participants within one week. These experiments\\nproduced results that closely matched the original studies, validating the\\nexperimental integrity of LUIDA across research domains. After technical\\nrefinements, we plan to release LUIDA as an open platform, providing a\\nstandardized protocol to improve research efficiency and experimental\\nreproducibility in VR studies.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T16:11:12Z\"}"}
