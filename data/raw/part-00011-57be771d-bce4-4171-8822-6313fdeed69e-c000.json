We use SUIT\\nobservations along with those from Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board\\nSDO and Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) on board Solar Orbiter\\nto infer the kinematics and thermal nature of the ejected blob and its\\nconnection to the associated flare. The observations show that the flare was\\ncomprised of two eruptions. The blob was ejected during the first eruption and\\nlater accelerated to velocities over 1500 km/s measured at a maximum projected\\nheight of ~ 178 Mm from the Sun's surface. The acceleration of the ejected\\nplasma blob is co-temporal with the bursty appearance of the hard X-ray light\\ncurve recorded by STIX. Radio spectrogram observations from STEREO-A/WAVES and\\nRSTN reveal type III bursts at the same time, indicative of magnetic\\nreconnection. DEM analysis using AIA observations suggests the plasma blob is\\ncomprised of cooler and denser plasma in comparison to the ambient corona. To\\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first observation of such a plasma blob\\nin the NUV, providing crucial measurements for eruption thermodynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T07:37:36Z\"}"}
