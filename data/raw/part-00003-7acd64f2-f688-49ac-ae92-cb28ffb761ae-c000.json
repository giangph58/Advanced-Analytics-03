Define \\\\( \\\\mathrm{Cyc}(G) \\\\) as the\\nset of all elements \\\\( a \\\\in G \\\\) such that for any $b\\\\in G$, the subgroup \\\\(\\n\\\\langle a, b \\\\rangle \\\\) is cyclic. The \\\\emph{non-cyclic graph} $\\\\Gamma(G)$ of\\n\\\\( G \\\\) is a simple undirected graph with vertex set \\\\( G \\\\setminus\\n\\\\mathrm{Cyc}(G) \\\\), where two distinct vertices \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are\\nadjacent if the subgroup \\\\( \\\\langle x, y \\\\rangle \\\\) is not cyclic. An\\nindependent subset $C$ of the vertex set of a graph $\\\\Gamma$ is called a\\nperfect code of $\\\\Gamma$ if every vertex of $V(\\\\Gamma)\\\\setminus C$ is adjacent\\nto exactly one vertex in $C$. A subset \\\\( T \\\\) of the vertex set a graph \\\\(\\n\\\\Gamma \\\\) is said to be a \\\\emph{total perfect code} if every vertex of \\\\(\\n\\\\Gamma \\\\) is adjacent to exactly one vertex in \\\\( T \\\\). In this paper, we prove\\nthat the graph $\\\\Gamma(G)$ is Hamiltonian for any finite non-cyclic nilpotent\\ngroup $G$. Also, we characterize all finite groups such that their non-cyclic\\ngraphs admit a perfect code. Finally, we prove that for a non-cyclic nilpotent\\ngroup $G$, the non-cyclic graph $\\\\Gamma(G)$ does not admit total perfect code.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T08:05:24Z\"}"}
