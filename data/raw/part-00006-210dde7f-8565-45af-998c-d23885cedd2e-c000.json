{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04353v1\", \"title\": \"Yield and Buckling Stress Limits in Topology Optimization of Multiscale\\n  Structures\", \"summary\": \"This study presents an extension of multiscale topology optimization by\\nintegrating both yield stress and local/global buckling considerations into the\\ndesign process. Building upon established multiscale methodologies, we develop\\na new framework incorporating yield stress limits either as constraints or\\nobjectives alongside previously established local and global buckling\\nconstraints. This approach significantly refines the optimization process,\\nensuring that the resulting designs meet mechanical performance criteria and\\nadhere to critical material yield constraints. First, we establish local\\ndensity-dependent von Mises yield surfaces based on local yield estimates from\\nhomogenization-based analysis to predict the local yield limits of the\\nhomogenized materials. Then, these local Yield-based Load Factors (YLFs) are\\ncombined with local and global buckling criteria to obtain topology optimized\\ndesigns that consider yield and buckling failure on all levels. This\\nintegration is crucial for the practical application of optimized structures in\\nreal-world scenarios, where material yield and stability behavior critically\\ninfluence structural integrity and durability. Numerical examples demonstrate\\nhow optimized designs depend on the stiffness to yield ratio of the considered\\nbuilding material. Despite the foundational assumption of separation of scales,\\nthe de-homogenized structures, even at relatively coarse length scales, exhibit\\na high degree of agreement with the corresponding homogenized predictions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CE\", \"categories\": \"cs.CE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T12:04:20Z\"}"}
