{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19894v1\", \"title\": \"CineVerse: Consistent Keyframe Synthesis for Cinematic Scene Composition\", \"summary\": \"We present CineVerse, a novel framework for the task of cinematic scene\\ncomposition. Similar to traditional multi-shot generation, our task emphasizes\\nthe need for consistency and continuity across frames. However, our task also\\nfocuses on addressing challenges inherent to filmmaking, such as multiple\\ncharacters, complex interactions, and visual cinematic effects. In order to\\nlearn to generate such content, we first create the CineVerse dataset. We use\\nthis dataset to train our proposed two-stage approach. First, we prompt a large\\nlanguage model (LLM) with task-specific instructions to take in a high-level\\nscene description and generate a detailed plan for the overall setting and\\ncharacters, as well as the individual shots. Then, we fine-tune a text-to-image\\ngeneration model to synthesize high-quality visual keyframes. Experimental\\nresults demonstrate that CineVerse yields promising improvements in generating\\nvisually coherent and contextually rich movie scenes, paving the way for\\nfurther exploration in cinematic video synthesis.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:28:14Z\"}"}
