{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04100v1\", \"title\": \"Linear Analysis of Stochastic Verlet-Type Integrators for Langevin\\n  Equations\", \"summary\": \"We provide an analytical framework for analyzing the quality of stochastic\\nVerlet-type integrators for simulating the Langevin equation. Focusing only on\\nbasic objective measures, we consider the ability of an integrator to correctly\\nsimulate characteristic configurational quantities of transport, a) diffusion\\non a flat surface and b) drift velocity on a tilted planar surface, as well as\\nc) statistical sampling of a harmonic potential. For any stochastic Verlet-type\\nintegrator expressed in its configurational form, we develop closed form\\nexpressions to directly assess these three most basic quantities as a function\\nof the applied time step. The applicability of the analysis is exemplified\\nthrough twelve representative integrators developed over the past five decades,\\nand algorithm performance is conveniently visualized through the three\\ncharacteristic measures for each integrator. The GJ set of integrators stands\\nout as the only option for correctly simulating diffusion, drift, and Boltzmann\\ndistribution in linear systems, and we therefore suggest that this general\\nmethod is best suited for high quality thermodynamic simulations of nonlinear\\nand complex systems, including for relatively high time steps compared to\\nsimulations with other integrators.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.comp-ph,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T03:35:43Z\"}"}
