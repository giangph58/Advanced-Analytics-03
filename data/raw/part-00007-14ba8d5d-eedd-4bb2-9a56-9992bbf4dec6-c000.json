Although this\\noffers multiple research perspectives, processing the data remains a challenge.\\nInfrastructures for analyzing, inspecting, exploring and communicating with\\ndata are mandatory. To address this issue, we introduce Jasmine, the JAvaScript\\nMultimodal INformation Explorer. Jasmine allows users to open different data\\nviewer modals that show a specific data point from a set. The viewer currently\\nsupports image data, as well as point cloud objects. Users can decide on which\\ninformation about the data point they like to have displayed. Point clouds are\\ninteractive and allow for zooming, tossing, and turning. Picking a data point\\nis enabled by providing a structured view of the set, arranged by a key\\nproperty. This arrangement is achieved by autoencoding.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T07:48:46Z\"}"}
