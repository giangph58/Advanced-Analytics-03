We discuss the scaling of\\nthe sensitivity of a galactic ALP dark matter search with the number of\\nsensors, especially in the ultra-light mass regime, where the measurement time\\nis shorter than the coherence time of the ALP field. We compare multiple\\nschemes for daily modulated ALP gradient signals, and show that increasing the\\nnumber of sensors from 1 to 2 improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by a\\nfactor of 2-3. For more than two sensors, the SNR increases as the square root\\nof the number of sensors. Then, we show that splitting the data into subsets\\nand then averaging its Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs) is equivalent to the\\nDFT of the whole dataset in terms of SNR.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T10:18:18Z\"}"}
