We explore the possibility\\nthat in a near future the FOCAL detector could be used to measure the jet at\\nforward rapidities, with the associated meson being measured by a central or\\nforward detector, and estimate the rapidity distributions for the $\\\\rho$ + jet\\nand $J/\\\\Psi$ + jet photoproduction in $pp$, $Pbp$ and $PbPb$ collisions. We\\ndemonstrate that the associated cross-sections are non - negligible and that a\\nfuture experimental analysis can be useful to constrain the description of the\\nBFKL kernel and improve our understanding of the QCD dynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T17:36:22Z\"}"}
