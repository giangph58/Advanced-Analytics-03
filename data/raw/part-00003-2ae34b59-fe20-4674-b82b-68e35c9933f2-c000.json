For application to\\nphysical systems, it is crucial that the reduced order model (ROM) is robust to\\nany disturbance that acts on the full order model (FOM) -- in the sense that\\nthe output of the ROM remains a good approximation of that of the FOM, even in\\nthe presence of such disturbances. In this work, we present a framework for\\nmodel order reduction for a class of continuous-time linear systems that\\nensures this property for any $L_2$ disturbance. Apart from robustness to\\ndisturbances in this sense, the proposed framework also displays other\\ndesirable properties for model order reduction: (1) a provable bound on the\\nerror defined as the $L_2$ norm of the difference between the output of the ROM\\nand FOM, (2) preservation of stability, (3) compositionality properties and a\\nprovable error bound for arbitrary interconnected systems, (4) a provable bound\\non the output of the FOM when the controller designed for the ROM is used with\\nthe FOM, and finally, (5) compatibility with existing approaches such as\\nbalanced truncation and moment matching. Property (4) does not require\\ncomputation of any gap metric and property (5) is beneficial as existing\\napproaches can also be equipped with some of the preceding properties. The\\ntheoretical results are corroborated on numerical case studies, including on a\\nbuilding model.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:28:54Z\"}"}
