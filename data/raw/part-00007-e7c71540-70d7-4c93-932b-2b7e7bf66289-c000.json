The burgeoning interest in process\\nmodeling and tool development, coupled with the rise of data visualisation\\nfield, underscores the significant role of visual tools in leveraging human\\ncognition. Unlike traditional models, data visualisation approaches graphics\\nfrom a novel angle, emphasising the potency of visual representations. This\\nreview aims to integrate the domains of BPV and data visualisation to assess\\ntheir combined influence on organisational effectiveness comprehensively.\\nThrough a meticulous analysis of existing literature, this study aims to\\namalgamate insights on BPVs impact from a data visualisation standpoint,\\nadvocating for a design philosophy that prioritises user engagement to bolster\\norganisational outcomes. Additionally, our systematic review has unveiled\\npromising avenues for future research, identifying underexplored variables that\\ninfluence the efficacy of BPVs, thereby charting a path for forthcoming\\nscholarly inquiries.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T08:26:04Z\"}"}
