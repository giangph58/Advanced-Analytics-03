To address these, we developed an interactive control\\nstrategy that assists the human operator by predicting their motion plan at\\nboth high and low levels. At the high level, a surgeme recognition system is\\nemployed through a Transformer-based real-time gesture classification model to\\ndynamically adapt to the operator's actions, while at the low level, a\\nConfidence-based Intention Assimilation Controller adjusts robot actions based\\non user intent and shared control paradigms. The system is built around a\\nrobotic suturing task, supported by sensors that capture the kinematics of the\\nrobot and task dynamics. Experiments across users with varying skill levels\\ndemonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing statistically\\nsignificant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared\\nto traditional teleoperation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:41:37Z\"}"}
