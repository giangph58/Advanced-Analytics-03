Based on Gaia and GALEX\", \"summary\": \"The statistical characteristics of double main-sequence (MS) binaries are\\nessential for investigating star formation, binary evolution, and population\\nsynthesis. Our previous study proposed a machine learning-based method to\\nidentify MS binaries from MS single stars using mock data from the Chinese\\nSpace Station Telescope (CSST). We further utilized detection efficiencies and\\nan empirical mass ratio distribution to estimate the binary fraction within the\\nsample. To further validate the effectiveness of this method, we conducted a\\nmore realistic sample simulation, incorporating additional factors such as\\nmetallicity, extinction, and photometric errors from CSST simulations. The\\ndetection efficiency for binaries with mass ratios between 0.2 and 0.7 reached\\nover 80%. We performed a detailed observational validation using the data\\nselected from the Gaia Sky Survey and Galaxy Evolution Explorer. The detection\\nefficiency for MS binaries in the observed sample was 65%. The binary fraction\\ncan be inferred with high precision for a set of observed samples, based on\\naccurate empirical mass ratio distribution.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T02:50:00Z\"}"}
