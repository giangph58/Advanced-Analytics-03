{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06921v1\", \"title\": \"Leveraging Anatomical Priors for Automated Pancreas Segmentation on\\n  Abdominal CT\", \"summary\": \"An accurate segmentation of the pancreas on CT is crucial to identify\\npancreatic pathologies and extract imaging-based biomarkers. However, prior\\nresearch on pancreas segmentation has primarily focused on modifying the\\nsegmentation model architecture or utilizing pre- and post-processing\\ntechniques. In this article, we investigate the utility of anatomical priors to\\nenhance the segmentation performance of the pancreas. Two 3D full-resolution\\nnnU-Net models were trained, one with 8 refined labels from the public PANORAMA\\ndataset, and another that combined them with labels derived from the public\\nTotalSegmentator (TS) tool. The addition of anatomical priors resulted in a 6\\\\%\\nincrease in Dice score ($p < .001$) and a 36.5 mm decrease in Hausdorff\\ndistance for pancreas segmentation ($p < .001$). Moreover, the pancreas was\\nalways detected when anatomy priors were used, whereas there were 8 instances\\nof failed detections without their use. The use of anatomy priors shows promise\\nfor pancreas segmentation and subsequent derivation of imaging biomarkers.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.AI,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:29:08Z\"}"}
