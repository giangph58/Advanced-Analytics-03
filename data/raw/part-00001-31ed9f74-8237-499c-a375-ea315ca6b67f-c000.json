A comprehensive study of\\n  X-ray and Ca II IRT fluxes from eROSITA and Gaia\", \"summary\": \"Stellar activity can be observed at different wavelengths in a variety of\\ndifferent activity indicators. We investigated the correlation between coronal\\nand chromospheric emissions by combining X-ray data from stars detected in the\\neROSITA all-sky surveys (eRASS1 and eRASS:5) with Ca II infrared triplet (IRT)\\nactivity indices as published in the third Gaia data release (Gaia DR3). We\\nspecifically studied 24 300 and 43 200 stellar sources with reliable Ca II IRT\\nmeasurement and X-ray detection in eRASS1 and eRASS:5, which is by far the\\nlargest stellar sample available so far. The largest detection fraction is\\nobtained for highly active sources and stars of a late spectral type, while\\nF-type and less active stars (as measured in the Ca II IRT) remain mostly\\nundetected in X-rays. Also, the correlation is the strongest for late-type\\nsources, while F-type stars show a rather weak correlation between the X-ray to\\nbolometric flux ratio and the Ca II IRT activity index. The relation between\\nthe X-ray and Ca II IRT surface fluxes changes with the fractional X-ray flux\\nwithout showing two separated branches as described in previous studies. For\\nfast rotators, both activity indicators saturate at a similar Rossby number and\\nthe X-ray to bolometric flux ratio decreases faster than the IRT index for\\nslower rotating stars. As a consequence, the ratio between X-ray and IRT fluxes\\nis constant in the saturation regime and decreases for slow rotators.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:21:56Z\"}"}
