More precisely, we show that up to elementary\\nequivalence, any NIP topological field arises from an NIP integral domain. As\\nan application, we prove several results about definable ring topologies on NIP\\nfields, including the following. Let $K$ be an NIP field or expansion of a\\nfield. Let $\\\\tau$ be a definable ring topology on $K$. Then $\\\\tau$ is a field\\ntopology, and $\\\\tau$ is locally bounded. If $K$ has characteristic $p$ or\\nfinite dp-rank, then $\\\\tau$ is \\\"generalized t-henselian\\\" in the sense of\\nDittman, Walsberg, and Ye, meaning that the implicit function theorem holds for\\npolynomials. If $K$ has finite dp-rank, then $\\\\tau$ must be a topology of\\n\\\"finite breadth\\\" (a $W_n$-topology). Using these techniques, we give some\\nreformulations of the conjecture that NIP local rings are henselian.\", \"main_category\": \"math.LO\", \"categories\": \"math.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T07:13:03Z\"}"}
