The\\ndephasing induced by the bath drives the system toward an infinite-temperature\\nsteady state, erasing all initial information-including signatures of\\nlocalization. We find that initially localized states can relax to the\\nhomogeneous steady state faster than delocalized states. Moreover,\\nlow-temperature initial states thermalize to infinite temperature more rapidly\\nthan high-temperature states-a phenomenon reminiscent of the Mpemba effect,\\nwhere hotter liquids freeze faster than warmer ones. The slowest relaxation\\nmode in the Liouvillian plays critical role in the expedited thermalization for\\nlocalized or cold initial states. Our results reveal that the combination of\\ndisordered structure and environmental dissipation may lead to non-trivial\\nthermalization behavior, which advances both the conceptual framework of the\\nMpemba effect and the theoretical understanding of nonequilibrium processes in\\ndissipative disordered systems.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.dis-nn\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:51:50Z\"}"}
