{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20507v1\", \"title\": \"Taxonomic Trace Links: Rethinking Traceability and its Benefits\", \"summary\": \"Traceability greatly supports knowledge-intensive tasks, e.g., coverage check\\nand impact analysis. Despite its clear benefits, the \\\\emph{practical}\\nimplementation of traceability poses significant challenges, leading to a\\nreduced focus on the creation and maintenance of trace links. We propose a new\\napproach -- Taxonomic Trace Links (TTL) -- which rethinks traceability and its\\nbenefits. With TTL, trace links are created indirectly through a\\ndomain-specific taxonomy, a simplified version of a domain model. TTL has the\\npotential to address key traceability challenges, such as the granularity of\\ntrace links, the lack of a common data structure among software development\\nartifacts, and unclear responsibility for traceability. We explain how TTL\\naddresses these challenges and perform an initial validation with\\npractitioners. We identified six challenges associated with TTL implementation\\nthat need to be addressed. Finally, we propose a research roadmap to further\\ndevelop and evaluate the technical solution of TTL. TTL appears to be\\nparticularly feasible in practice where a domain taxonomy is already\\nestablished\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T07:47:38Z\"}"}
