In\\nthis work, we revisit the scalaron's interactions with Standard Model\\nparticles, assuming their minimal coupling to gravity. In particular, we refine\\nthe scalaron decay rate into photons. Assuming the scalaron constitutes all of\\ndark matter, we calculate the average cosmological background radiation\\nproduced by these decays. We also estimate the contribution of primordial\\nthermal scalarons to the present dark matter density and find it to be\\nnegligible. This supports the original scenario in which the scalaron dark\\nmatter behaves as a coherently oscillating field.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T05:48:11Z\"}"}
