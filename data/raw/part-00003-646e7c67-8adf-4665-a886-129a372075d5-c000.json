We investigate the stochastic\\ngravitational wave background (SGWB) that may be sourced directly at the second\\norder by such a torsional field, treated perturbatively during an epoch of\\ncanonical, single-field, slow-roll inflation. The resulting second-order\\ninduced SGWB, which dominates over the primary inflationary GW background at\\nall scales, peaks only at ultra-low frequencies, and is found to be extremely\\nred-tilted with an effective tensor spectral index $\\\\alpha_{\\\\rm T}\\\\sim-6$ on\\nmatter-dominated scales. The signal is potentially within the reach of upcoming\\nindirect GW probes on very large scales $k\\\\lesssim10^{-2}\\\\:\\\\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$,\\ni.e., next-generation CMB experiments like the LiteBIRD. In the near future,\\nobservation of such a markedly red-tilted SGWB on CMB scales could hence\\nprovide a novel and unique clue in favour of torsional gravity during the\\ninflationary era.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:52:22Z\"}"}
