We derive explicit error estimates in the large-particle\\nlimit for two objects: the empirical measure of the interacting particle system\\nand the density distribution of a single particle. Specifically, under certain\\nassumptions on the interaction kernel and initial conditions, we show that the\\nconvergence rate of both objects towards solutions of the corresponding\\nnonlinear FokkerPlanck equation depends polynomially on N (the number of\\nparticles) and on h (the discretization step). The analysis shows that the\\nscheme converges despite singularities in the drift term. To the best of our\\nknowledge, there are no existing results in the literature of such kind for the\\nsingular kernels considered in this work.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,cs.NA,math.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T15:24:44Z\"}"}
