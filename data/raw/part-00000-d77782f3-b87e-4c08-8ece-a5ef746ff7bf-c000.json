{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20620v1\", \"title\": \"Data Driven Deep Learning for Correcting Global Climate Model\\n  Projections of SST and DSL in the Bay of Bengal\", \"summary\": \"Climate change alters ocean conditions, notably temperature and sea level. In\\nthe Bay of Bengal, these changes influence monsoon precipitation and marine\\nproductivity, critical to the Indian economy. In Phase 6 of the Coupled Model\\nIntercomparison Project (CMIP6), Global Climate Models (GCMs) use different\\nshared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) to obtain future climate projections.\\nHowever, significant discrepancies are observed between these models and the\\nreanalysis data in the Bay of Bengal for 2015-2024. Specifically, the root mean\\nsquare error (RMSE) between the climate model output and the Ocean Reanalysis\\nSystem (ORAS5) is 1.2C for the sea surface temperature (SST) and 1.1 m for the\\ndynamic sea level (DSL). We introduce a new data-driven deep learning model to\\ncorrect for this bias. The deep neural model for each variable is trained using\\npairs of climatology-removed monthly climate projections as input and the\\ncorresponding month's ORAS5 as output. This model is trained with historical\\ndata (1950 to 2014), validated with future projection data from 2015 to 2020,\\nand tested with future projections from 2021 to 2023. Compared to the\\nconventional EquiDistant Cumulative Distribution Function (EDCDF) statistical\\nmethod for bias correction in climate models, our approach decreases RMSE by\\n0.15C for SST and 0.3 m for DSL. The trained model subsequently corrects the\\nprojections for 2024-2100. A detailed analysis of the monthly, seasonal, and\\ndecadal means and variability is performed to underscore the implications of\\nthe novel dynamics uncovered in our corrected projections.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ao-ph,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T10:40:37Z\"}"}
