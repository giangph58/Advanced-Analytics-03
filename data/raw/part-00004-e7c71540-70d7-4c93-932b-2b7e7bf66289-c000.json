In contrast to graphene, where these\\nmodes are gapless, plasmons in Weyl semimetals are gapped. This gap, however,\\ncan be made arbitrarily small by decreasing the temperature or the chemical\\npotential, making plasmon modes thermally accessible, both in thermodynamics\\nand transport. In very clean Weyl semimetals near charge-neutrality where the\\nplasmon gap is minimal, we find that they leave an imprint in the thermal\\nconductivity and the viscosity.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T08:20:45Z\"}"}
