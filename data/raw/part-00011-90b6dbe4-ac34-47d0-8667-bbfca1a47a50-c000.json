{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12777v1\", \"title\": \"Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Simulation for Environmental Policy\\n  Synthesis\", \"summary\": \"Climate policy development faces significant challenges due to deep\\nuncertainty, complex system dynamics, and competing stakeholder interests.\\nClimate simulation methods, such as Earth System Models, have become valuable\\ntools for policy exploration. However, their typical use is for evaluating\\npotential polices, rather than directly synthesizing them. The problem can be\\ninverted to optimize for policy pathways, but the traditional optimization\\napproaches often struggle with non-linear dynamics, heterogeneous agents, and\\ncomprehensive uncertainty quantification. We propose a framework for augmenting\\nclimate simulations with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to address\\nthese limitations. We identify key challenges at the interface between climate\\nsimulations and the application of MARL in the context of policy synthesis,\\nincluding reward definition, scalability with increasing agents and state\\nspaces, uncertainty propagation across linked systems, and solution validation.\\nAdditionally, we discuss challenges in making MARL-derived solutions\\ninterpretable and useful for policy-makers. Our framework provides a foundation\\nfor more sophisticated climate policy exploration while acknowledging important\\nlimitations and areas for future research.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MA\", \"categories\": \"cs.MA,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T09:18:04Z\"}"}
