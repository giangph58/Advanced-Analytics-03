These measurements put constraints on a low-energy constant in\\nthe weak Lagrangian, $d_\\\\Delta$, corresponding to a parity-violating\\nelectric-dipole transition matrix element. This matrix element has been shown\\nto be large in the strangeness-changing channel, via weak hyperon decays such\\nas $\\\\Sigma ^+ \\\\rightarrow p\\\\gamma$. The measurements reported here constrain\\n$d_\\\\Delta$ in the strangeness-conserving channel. The final asymmetries were\\n-0.65 +- 1.00 (stat.) +- 1.02 (syst) ppm (parts per million) for 0.877 GeV and\\n-3.59 +- 0.82 (stat.) +- 1.33 (syst.} ppm for 1.16 GeV. With these results we\\ndeduce a small value for $d_\\\\Delta$, consistent with zero, in the\\nstrangeness-conserving channel, in contrast to the large value for $d_\\\\Delta$\\npreviously reported in the strangeness-changing channel.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-ex\", \"categories\": \"nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:29:08Z\"}"}
