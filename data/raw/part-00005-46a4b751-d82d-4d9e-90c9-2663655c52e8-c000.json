{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15079v1\", \"title\": \"Generative Artificial Intelligence for Beamforming in Low-Altitude\\n  Economy\", \"summary\": \"The growth of low-altitude economy (LAE) has driven a rising demand for\\nefficient and secure communication. However, conventional beamforming\\noptimization techniques struggle in the complex LAE environments. In this\\ncontext, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) methods provide a promising\\nsolution. In this article, we first introduce the core concepts of LAE and the\\nroles of beamforming in advanced communication technologies for LAE. We then\\nexamine their interrelation, followed by an analysis of the limitations of\\nconventional beamforming methods. Next, we provide an overview of how GenAI\\nmethods enhance the process of beamforming, with a focus on its applications in\\nLAE. Furthermore, we present a case study using a generative diffusion model\\n(GDM)-based algorithm to enhance the performance of aerial collaborative\\nbeamforming-enabled remote secure communications in LAE and simulation results\\nverified the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Finally, promising\\nresearch opportunities are identified.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T13:09:15Z\"}"}
