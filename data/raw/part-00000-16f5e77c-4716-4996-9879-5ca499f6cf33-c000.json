We concentrate on the full algebraic structures of the above\\ncontinuous symmetry transformation operators along with a couple of very useful\\ndiscrete duality symmetry transformation operators existing in our four (3 +\\n1)-dimensional (4D) field-theoretic model. We establish the relevance of the\\nalgebraic structures, respected by the above discrete and continuous symmetry\\noperators, to the algebraic structures that are obeyed by the de Rham\\ncohomological operators of differential geometry. One of the highlights of our\\npresent endeavor is the observation that there are no ``exotic'' fields with\\nthe negative kinetic terms in our present 4D field-theoretic example for Hodge\\ntheory.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T16:49:23Z\"}"}
