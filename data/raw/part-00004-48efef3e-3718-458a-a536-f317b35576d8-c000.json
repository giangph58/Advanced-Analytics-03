{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09908v1\", \"title\": \"Laser-induced spectral diffusion and excited-state mixing of silicon T\\n  centres\", \"summary\": \"To find practical application as photon sources for entangled optical\\nresource states or as spin-photon interfaces in entangled networks,\\nsemiconductor emitters must produce indistinguishable photons with high\\nefficiency and spectral stability. Nanophotonic cavity integration increases\\nefficiency and bandwidth, but it also introduces environmental charge\\ninstability and spectral diffusion. Among various candidates, silicon colour\\ncentres have emerged as compelling platforms for integrated-emitter quantum\\ntechnologies. Here we investigate the dynamics of spectral wandering in\\nnanophotonics-coupled, individual silicon T centres using spectral correlation\\nmeasurements. We observe that spectral fluctuations are driven predominantly by\\nthe near-infrared excitation laser, consistent with a power-dependent\\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck process, and show that the spectrum is stable for up to 1.5\\nms in the dark. We demonstrate a 35x narrowing of the emitter linewidth to 110\\nMHz using a resonance-check scheme and discuss the advantage for pairwise\\nentanglement rates and optical resource state generators. Finally, we report\\nlaser-induced spin-mixing in the excited state and discuss potential mechanisms\\ncommon to both phenomena. These effects must be considered in calibrating T\\ncentre devices for high-performance entanglement generation.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T06:09:17Z\"}"}
