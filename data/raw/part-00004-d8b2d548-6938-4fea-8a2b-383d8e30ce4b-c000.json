For the silicon strip detector, the\\nsimultaneous readout of all strips of the X-Y detector was evaluated, in\\naddition to the detection efficiency being assessed through coincidences with\\nthe trigger scintillators. The results demonstrated the successful acquisition\\nof data with full strip readout and the reconstruction of the two-dimensional\\nbeam profile. Furthermore, we are contemplating the incorporation of GAGG\\ncrystals, an inorganic scintillator characterized by a high light yield\\n($\\\\sim$$5 \\\\times 10^{4}$ photons/MeV) and a brief time constant ($\\\\sim$60 ns),\\nwithin the newly developed time-of-flight detector. We assessed the resolution\\nof time-of-flight based on the data, with the objective of achieving the\\nrequired performance benchmarks through future improvements to the\\ntime-of-tlight detector.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T05:10:56Z\"}"}
