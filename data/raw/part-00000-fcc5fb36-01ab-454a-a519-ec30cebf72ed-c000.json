In this paper, we study\\ntensor categorical properties of DHR bimodules over abstract spin chains.\\nAssuming that the charge transporters generate the algebra of observables, we\\nprove that the associated category has a structure of modular tensor category\\nwith respect to the natural braiding. Under an additional assumption of\\nalgebraic Haag duality, this category becomes the Drinfeld center of the\\nhalf-line fusion category.\", \"main_category\": \"math.QA\", \"categories\": \"math.QA,math-ph,math.MP,math.OA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:35:19Z\"}"}
