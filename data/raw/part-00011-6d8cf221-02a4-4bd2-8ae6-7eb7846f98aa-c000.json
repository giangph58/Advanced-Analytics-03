For an incident photon pair, we find\\nnear-perfect single excitation transfer efficiency with negligible double\\nexcitation transfer in the weak coupling regime. In the strong coupling regime,\\nsingle excitation transfer efficiency was greater than 90%, while the double\\nexcitation efficiency was approximately 50%. We have found that the three main\\nfactors which determine high transfer efficiencies are large acceptor\\nprobabilities, long acceptor decay times, and strong photon-ring coupling. A\\npossible implementation of the theoretical framework to bio-inspired solar\\nenergy devices is also discussed.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T15:26:19Z\"}"}
