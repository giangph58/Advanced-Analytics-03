{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15082v1\", \"title\": \"An island-parallel ensemble metaheuristic algorithm for large graph\\n  coloring problems\", \"summary\": \"Graph Coloring Problem (GCP) is an NP-Hard vertex labeling problem in graphs\\nsuch that no two adjacent vertices can have the same color. Large instances of\\nGCP cannot be solved in reasonable execution times by exact algorithms.\\nTherefore, soft computing approaches, such as metaheuristics, have proven to be\\nvery efficient for solving large instances of GCP. In this study, we propose a\\nnew island-parallel ensemble metaheuristic algorithm (PEM-Color) to solve large\\nGCP instances. Ensemble learning is a new machine learning approach based on\\ncombining the output of multiple models instead of using a single one. We use\\nMessage Passing Interface (MPI) parallel computation libraries to combine\\nrecent state-of-the-art metaheuristics: Harris Hawk Optimization (HHO),\\nArtificial Bee Colony (ABC), and Teaching Learning Based (TLBO) to improve the\\nquality of their solutions further. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\\nfirst study that combines metaheuristics and applies to the GCP using an\\nensemble approach. We conducted experiments on large graph instances from the\\nwell-known DIMACS benchmark using 64 processors and achieved significant\\nimprovements in execution times. The experiments also indicate an almost linear\\nspeed-up with a strong scalability potential. The solution quality of the\\ninstances is promising, as our algorithm outperforms 13 state-of-the-art\\nalgorithms.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NE\", \"categories\": \"cs.NE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T13:15:23Z\"}"}
