Previous efforts have been\\nlimited to simplified geometries and material characterizations, typically\\nconsidering only friction angle, which does not reflect the complexity of\\nrealistic geotechnical systems such as slopes encountered in engineering\\npractice. This study introduces a differentiable GNS framework designed for\\nmulti-layered slope systems comprising both forward and inverse modeling\\ncomponents. The forward component relies on a fine-tuned GNS that incorporates\\nboth friction angle and cohesion. Its performance is demonstrated through\\ncolumn collapse and multi-layered slope runout simulations, where GNS\\nreplicates multi-material flow dynamics while achieving up to 145x\\ncomputational speedup over the Material Point Method (MPM). The inverse\\nmodeling component leverages the trained GNS, reverse-mode automatic\\ndifferentiation, and L-BFGS-B optimization to infer material properties from a\\ntarget runout geometry. Its performance is demonstrated by back-calculating the\\nmaterial strengths that led to failure-induced runout in a dam system composed\\nof multiple materials. Results are obtained within minutes and show good\\nagreement with the target strength values. The framework introduced in this\\nstudy provides an efficient approach for forward runout assessments and inverse\\nstrength back-calculation in realistic slope systems.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.geo-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.geo-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T14:28:30Z\"}"}
