Electrons are coherently split into two paths, with one\\npath traversing the cavity, becoming entangled with its photonic state. A\\nsequence of such entanglement interactions can achieve cooling of the cavity:\\ne.g., a twofold reduction in thermal photon number with a 25% post-selection\\nprobability. This ``which-path''-based approach extends to other qubit\\noscillator systems, such as phonons in crystals or optomechanical resonators,\\noffering a general framework for quantum oscillator cooling.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T09:41:43Z\"}"}
