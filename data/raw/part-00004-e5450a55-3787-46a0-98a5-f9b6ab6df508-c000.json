For a given problem $P\\n\\\\in \\\\NP$, its FCP variant is denoted by FCP-$P$. While several \\\\NP-complete\\nproblems have been shown to have $\\\\Sigma_2^\\\\p$-complete FCP variants, it\\nremains open whether this holds for all \\\\NP-complete problems.\\n  In this work, we propose a meta-theorem that establishes the\\n$\\\\Sigma_2^\\\\p$-completeness of FCP-$P$ under the condition that the \\\\NP-hardness\\nof $P$ is proven via a polynomial-time reduction satisfying certain structural\\nproperties. Furthermore, we apply the meta-theorem to demonstrate the\\n$\\\\Sigma_2^\\\\p$-completeness of the FCP variants of several \\\\NP-complete\\nproblems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CC\", \"categories\": \"cs.CC,F.1.3\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T08:30:34Z\"}"}
