To do so, we establish an intrinsic gauge-fixing procedure\\nfor the geometric data, which allows us to derive the extended BMS symmetries\\nand the correct transformation law of the shear, encoded in the connection. Our\\nanalysis reveals that the invariant Lagrangians are always topological, thereby\\nreducing the 4d bulk to a 2d boundary theory. Moreover, we find that\\nsupertranslations are anomaly-free, while superrotations exhibit independent\\ncentral charges. This BMS field theory is dual to Einstein gravity in\\nasymptotically flat spacetimes when the superrotation anomalies coincide and\\nare dictated by the bulk. Meanwhile, the absence of supertranslation anomalies\\naligns with Weinberg's soft graviton theorem being tree-level exact. This work\\nprovides a first-principle derivation of the structure of the null boundary\\nfield theory, intrinsic and independent of bulk considerations, offering\\nfurther evidence for the holographic principle in flat space, and its\\ndimensional reduction.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,gr-qc,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T15:12:30Z\"}"}
