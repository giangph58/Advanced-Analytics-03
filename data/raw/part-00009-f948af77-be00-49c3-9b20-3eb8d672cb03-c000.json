{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16889v1\", \"title\": \"Characterization of a GAGG detector for neutron measurements in\\n  underground laboratories\", \"summary\": \"In rare events experiments, such as those devoted to the direct search of\\ndark matter, a precise knowledge of the environmental gamma and neutron\\nbackgrounds is crucial for reaching the design experiment sensitivity. The\\nneutron component is often poorly known due to the lack of a scalable detector\\ntechnology for the precise measurement of low-flux neutron spectra.\\nGd$_3$Al$_2$Ga$_3$O$_{12}$ (GAGG) is a newly developed, high-density\\nscintillating crystal with a high gadolinium content, which could allow to\\nexploit the high $(n,\\\\gamma)$ cross section of $^{155}$Gd and $^{157}$Gd for\\nneutron measurements in underground environments. GAGG crystals feature a high\\nscintillation light yield, good timing performance, and the capability of\\nparticle identification via pulse-shape discrimination. In a low-background\\nenvironment, the distinctive signature produced by neutron capture on\\ngadolinium, namely a $\\\\beta/\\\\gamma$ cascade releasing up to 9 MeV of total\\nenergy, and the efficient particle identification provided by GAGG could yield\\na background-free neutron capture signal. In this work, we present the\\ncharacterization of a first GAGG detector prototype in terms of particle\\ndiscrimination performance, intrinsic radioactive contamination, and neutron\\nresponse.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det,nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T17:08:26Z\"}"}
