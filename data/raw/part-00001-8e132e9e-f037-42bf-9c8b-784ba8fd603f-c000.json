Anthropic Selection in a $\\u039b$ + Axion Dark Energy\\n  Model\", \"summary\": \"We study a dark energy model composed of a bare negative cosmological\\nconstant and a single ultra-light axion, motivated by the string axiverse.\\nAssuming that intelligent observers can exist and observe an accelerating\\nuniverse, we derive nontrivial constraints on both the axion mass and the bare\\ncosmological constant. The axion mass is bounded from above to avoid\\nfine-tuning of the initial misalignment angle near the hilltop, and from below\\nbecause extremely light axions would require the bare cosmological constant to\\nbe unnaturally close to zero to achieve accelerated expansion. As a result, the\\nanthropically allowed axion mass range typically lies around $m =\\n\\\\mathcal{O}(10)\\\\, H_0$ for a decay constant close to the Planck scale, where\\n$H_0$ is the observed value of the Hubble constant. In this framework, the dark\\nenergy equation of state parameter $w_0$ generically deviates from $-1$ by\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}(0.1)$, providing a natural explanation for why $w \\\\ne -1$ may be\\nexpected. This outcome is intriguingly consistent with recent DESI hints of\\ntime-varying dark energy, and offers a compelling anthropic explanation within\\nthe $\\\\Lambda$ + axion framework.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T11:19:58Z\"}"}
