When the\\nnonlinear effect is not strong, we show pointwise-in-time dispersive decay for\\nsolutions to the gDNLS equation with small initial data in\\n$H^{\\\\frac{1}{2}+}(\\\\mathbb{R})$ utilizing crucially Lorentz-space improvements\\nof the traditional Strichartz inequality. When the nonlinear effect is\\nespecially dominant, there exists a sequence of solitary waves that are\\narbitrary small in the energy space, which means the small data scattering is\\nnot true. However, there is evidence that it is not possible for the solitons\\nto be localized in $L^{2}(\\\\mathbb{R})$ and small in $H^{1}(\\\\mathbb{R})$. With\\nsmall and localized data assumption, we obtain global asymptotic behavior for\\nsolutions to the gDNLS equation by using vector field methods combined with the\\ntesting by wave packets method.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:23:12Z\"}"}
