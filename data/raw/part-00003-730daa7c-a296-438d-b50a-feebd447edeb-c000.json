In 2012 Chen and Singer introduced discrete residues as a\\ntheoretical obstruction to summability for rational functions with respect to\\nthe shift and $q$-dilation difference operators. Since then analogous notions\\nof discrete residues have been defined in other difference settings relevant\\nfor applications, such as for Mahler and elliptic shift difference operators.\\nVery recently there have been some advances in making these theoretical\\nobstructions computable in practice.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SC\", \"categories\": \"cs.SC,math.AG,math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:24:02Z\"}"}
