{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12813v1\", \"title\": \"Approaching Current Challenges in Developing a Software Stack for Fully\\n  Autonomous Driving\", \"summary\": \"Autonomous driving is a complex undertaking. A common approach is to break\\ndown the driving task into individual subtasks through modularization. These\\nsub-modules are usually developed and published separately. However, if these\\nindividually developed algorithms have to be combined again to form a\\nfull-stack autonomous driving software, this poses particular challenges.\\nDrawing upon our practical experience in developing the software of TUM\\nAutonomous Motorsport, we have identified and derived these challenges in\\ndeveloping an autonomous driving software stack within a scientific\\nenvironment. We do not focus on the specific challenges of individual\\nalgorithms but on the general difficulties that arise when deploying research\\nalgorithms on real-world test vehicles. To overcome these challenges, we\\nintroduce strategies that have been effective in our development approach. We\\nadditionally provide open-source implementations that enable these concepts on\\nGitHub. As a result, this paper's contributions will simplify future full-stack\\nautonomous driving projects, which are essential for a thorough evaluation of\\nthe individual algorithms.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T10:17:24Z\"}"}
