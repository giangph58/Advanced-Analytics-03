We prove that the spectrum of\\n$\\\\Delta_f$ is discrete for immersed hypersurfaces with bounded weighted mean\\ncurvature in a Ricci shrinker with a mild condition on the potential function.\\nNext, we give a lower bound for the first nonzero eigenvalue of $\\\\Delta_f$ when\\nthe hypersurface is an embedded $f$-minimal one. This estimate contains the\\ncase of compact minimal hypersurfaces in a positive Einstein manifold, in\\nparticular Choi and Wang's estimate for minimal hypersurfaces in a round\\nsphere. The estimate also recovers the ones of Ding-Xin and Brendle-Tsiamis on\\nself-shrinkers.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T13:04:23Z\"}"}
