However, interactions\\nbetween the pump light and the superconducting resonator often induce\\nunintended resonance frequency shifts and linewidth broadening. In this study,\\nwe measure the local optical response of a NbTiN nanowire resonator using a\\nlaser-scanning microwave spectroscopy system integrated with a dilution\\nrefrigerator. The optical response of the resonator shows correlation with the\\nresonance modes and position, which is attributed to the two-level system\\naround the resonator. These findings not only contribute to the design and\\nunderstanding of quantum transducers and single-photon detectors, but also to\\nthe understandings of catastrophic high-energy particle irradiation events that\\ngenerate unintended phonons in quantum devices.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T10:51:26Z\"}"}
