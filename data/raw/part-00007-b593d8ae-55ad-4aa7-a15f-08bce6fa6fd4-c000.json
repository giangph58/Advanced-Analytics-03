Using model hydrogels with\\nprecisely defined network structures, we experimentally reveal a universal law\\ngoverning linear polymer partitioning into flexible polymer networks. We\\nestablish a novel label-free, contactless method to measure partition ratio,\\nbased on the increase in osmotic pressure induced by external polymer chains\\npartitioning into the network. Moreover, we find a universal law in which the\\npartition constant is solely determined by the squared ratio $(R_g /\\nl_\\\\mathrm{cycle})^2$, where $R_g$ is the gyration radius of the polymer chain\\nand $l_\\\\mathrm{cycle}$ is the characteristic mesh size of the network, as\\ndefined by the cycle length.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.stat-mech,physics.bio-ph,physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:01:22Z\"}"}
