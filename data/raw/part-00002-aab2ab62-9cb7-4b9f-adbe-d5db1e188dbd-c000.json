SEMPO allows to determine this\\nfull set of complex parameters of linear physical systems from their spectral\\nresponses only, without prior information about the system. The method\\nleverages on the Singularity Expansion Method of the physical signal. This\\nanalytical expansion of the meromorphic function in the complex frequency plane\\nmotivates the use of the Cauchy method and auto-differentiation-based\\noptimization approach to retrieve the complex poles, zeros and residues from\\nthe knowledge of the spectrum over a finite and real spectral range. Both\\napproaches can be sequentially associated to provide highly accurate\\nreconstructions of physical signals in large spectral windows. The performances\\nof SEMPO are assessed and analysed in several configurations that include the\\ndielectric permittivity of materials and the optical response spectra of\\nvarious optical metasurfaces.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,math-ph,math.MP,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T12:27:57Z\"}"}
