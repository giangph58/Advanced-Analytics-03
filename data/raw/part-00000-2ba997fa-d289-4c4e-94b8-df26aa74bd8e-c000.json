Initially, strain effects\\non bulk MnN were considered as a proxy for lattice-matching induced strain and\\na linear relationship between the c/a ratio and the MAE was found. This\\nrelationship was explained in terms of underlying point group symmetry. Strain\\nand charge-transfer effects were then considered for an ultra-thin film. It was\\nfound that a Ta seed-layer suppresses the net spin moment on the Mn ions,\\nleading to a reduction of the MAE.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:20:42Z\"}"}
