{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11970v1\", \"title\": \"Online Training and Inference System on Edge FPGA Using Delayed Feedback\\n  Reservoir\", \"summary\": \"A delayed feedback reservoir (DFR) is a hardwarefriendly reservoir computing\\nsystem. Implementing DFRs in embedded hardware requires efficient online\\ntraining. However, two main challenges prevent this: hyperparameter selection,\\nwhich is typically done by offline grid search, and training of the output\\nlinear layer, which is memory-intensive. This paper introduces a fast and\\naccurate parameter optimization method for the reservoir layer utilizing\\nbackpropagation and gradient descent by adopting a modular DFR model. A\\ntruncated backpropagation strategy is proposed to reduce memory consumption\\nassociated with the expansion of the recursive structure while maintaining\\naccuracy. The computation time is significantly reduced compared to grid\\nsearch. Additionally, an in-place Ridge regression for the output layer via 1-D\\nCholesky decomposition is presented, reducing memory usage to be 1/4. These\\nmethods enable the realization of an online edge training and inference system\\nof DFR on an FPGA, reducing computation time by about 1/13 and power\\nconsumption by about 1/27 compared to software implementation on the same\\nboard.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AR\", \"categories\": \"cs.AR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T11:03:56Z\"}"}
