{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11817v1\", \"title\": \"Density-field structures in a few systems undergoing velocity ordering\", \"summary\": \"We consider two (off-lattice) varieties of out-of-equilibrium systems, viz.,\\ngranular and active matter systems, that, in addition to displaying velocity\\nordering, exhibit fascinating pattern formation in the density field, similar\\nto those during vapor-liquid phase transitions. In the granular system,\\nvelocity ordering occurs due to reduction in the normal components of\\nvelocities, arising from inelastic collisions. In the active matter case, on\\nthe other hand, velocity alignment occurs because of the inherent tendency of\\nthe active particles to follow each other. Inspite of this difference, the\\npatterns, even during density-field evolutions, in these systems can be\\nremarkably similar. This we have quantified via the calculations of the\\ntwo-point equal time correlation functions and the structure factors. These\\nresults have been compared with the well studied case of kinetics of phase\\nseparation within the framework of the Ising model. Despite the order-parameter\\nconservation constraint in all the cases, in the density field, the\\nquantitative structural features in the Ising case is quite different from\\nthose for the granular and active matters. Interestingly, the correlation\\nfunction for the latter varieties, particularly for an active matter model,\\nquite accurately describes the structure in a real assembly of biologically\\nactive particles.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T07:05:44Z\"}"}
