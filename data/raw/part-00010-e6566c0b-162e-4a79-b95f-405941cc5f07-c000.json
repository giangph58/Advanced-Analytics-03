Indeed, the charge induced by irradiation and electron\\nemission disturbs the measurement. It is therefore important to quantify this\\ncharge during the measurement. Using a Kelvin probe allows both the emission\\nyield and the induced charge to be measured. However, this method requires the\\nprobe to be placed inside the vacuum chamber, which is often complicated or\\neven impossible. We propose a complete redesign of this method to overcome this\\nissue. A capacitive coupling now allows the potential probe to be placed\\noutside the chamber, in ambient atmosphere. Beyond this major simplification in\\nimplementation, we have also introduced several improvements that simplify the\\nmeasurement protocol and reduce the overall measurement time. The new method\\nwas first validated on a metallic sample (Cu), and subsequently applied to a\\npolymer (Kapton).\", \"main_category\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T08:06:05Z\"}"}
