Unfortunately,\\ntraditional generative methods often fall into repetitive patterns, resulting\\nin monotonous galleries of texts after only a few iterations. In this paper, we\\ninvestigate LLM-based data-to-text approaches to automatically generate\\nmarketing texts that are of sufficient quality and diverse enough for broad\\nadoption. We leverage Language Models such as T5, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and LLaMa2 in\\nconjunction with fine-tuning, few-shot, and zero-shot approaches to set a\\nbaseline for diverse marketing texts. We also introduce a metric JaccDiv to\\nevaluate the diversity of a set of texts. This research extends its relevance\\nbeyond the music industry, proving beneficial in various fields where\\nrepetitive automated content generation is prevalent.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T15:19:06Z\"}"}
