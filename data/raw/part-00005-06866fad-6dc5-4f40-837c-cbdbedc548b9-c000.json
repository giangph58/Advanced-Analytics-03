We introduce a novel\\napproach called Locally-Subdivided Neural Intersection Function (LSNIF) that\\nreplaces bottom-level BVHs used as traditional geometric representations with a\\nneural network. Our method introduces a sparse hash grid encoding scheme\\nincorporating geometry voxelization, a scene-agnostic training data collection,\\nand a tailored loss function. It enables the network to output not only\\nvisibility but also hit-point information and material indices. LSNIF can be\\ntrained offline for a single object, allowing us to use LSNIF as a replacement\\nfor its corresponding BVH. With these designs, the network can handle hit-point\\nqueries from any arbitrary viewpoint, supporting all types of rays in the\\nrendering pipeline. We demonstrate that LSNIF can render a variety of scenes,\\nincluding real-world scenes designed for other path tracers, while achieving a\\nmemory footprint reduction of up to 106.2x compared to a compressed BVH.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GR\", \"categories\": \"cs.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T13:29:42Z\"}"}
