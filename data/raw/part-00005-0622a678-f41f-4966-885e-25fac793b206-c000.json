In\\nthis work, we present the rich phase diagram of interacting bosons in\\ndisordered two-dimensional optical lattice, modelled by the disordered\\nBose-Hubbard model. We systematically probe the effect of long-range\\ninteraction truncated to the nearest neighbors and next-nearest neighbors on\\nthe phase diagram. We investigate the zero-temperature ground-state quantum\\nphases using the single-site Gutzwiller mean field (SGMF) theory. We also\\nemploy strong-coupling perturbative expansion to identify the nature of\\nground-state solid phases analytically. At sufficiently high disorder strength,\\nwe observe a quantum phase transition between the DS and BG phases. We have\\ninvestigated this transition in greater detail using cluster Gutzwiller mean\\nfield theory to study the effect of inter-site correlations which is absent in\\nthe SGMF method. We have also studied this phase transition from the\\nperspective of percolation theory.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:47:06Z\"}"}
