{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21472v1\", \"title\": \"Robust Orthogonal NMF with Label Propagation for Image Clustering\", \"summary\": \"Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a popular unsupervised learning\\napproach widely used in image clustering. However, in real-world clustering\\nscenarios, most existing NMF methods are highly sensitive to noise corruption\\nand are unable to effectively leverage limited supervised information. To\\novercome these drawbacks, we propose a unified non-convex framework with label\\npropagation called robust orthogonal nonnegative matrix factorization (RONMF).\\nThis method not only considers the graph Laplacian and label propagation as\\nregularization terms but also introduces a more effective non-convex structure\\nto measure the reconstruction error and imposes orthogonal constraints on the\\nbasis matrix to reduce the noise corruption, thereby achieving higher\\nrobustness. To solve RONMF, we develop an alternating direction method of\\nmultipliers (ADMM)-based optimization algorithm. In particular, all subproblems\\nhave closed-form solutions, which ensures its efficiency. Experimental\\nevaluations on eight public image datasets demonstrate that the proposed RONMF\\noutperforms state-of-the-art NMF methods across various standard metrics and\\nshows excellent robustness.
