We investigate the $95$ GeV diphoton excess and\\ndark matter within the framework of the triplet-extended Minimal Supersymmetric\\nStandard Model (TMSSM). In this model, an additional Hypercharge $Y=0$,\\n$SU(2)_L$ triplet superfield is introduced. Mixing between the triplet and\\ndoublet Higgs states enhances the diphoton signal strength of the $95$ GeV\\nHiggs boson, resulting in $\\\\mu_{\\\\gamma\\\\gamma}^{\\\\text{CMS+ATLAS}} =\\n0.24_{-0.08}^{+0.09}$, which is consistent with experimental observations. This\\nenhancement arises primarily from charged Higgs loop contributions.\\nAdditionally, the model accommodates viable dark matter candidates in the form\\nof a bino-dominated neutralino. The relic density is reduced to the observed\\nvalue through resonance-enhanced annihilation via the Higgs portal or\\nco-annihilation with the triplino or higgsino. This reduction remains\\nconsistent with constraints from direct and indirect detection experiments. A\\ncomprehensive parameter scan demonstrates that the TMSSM can simultaneously\\nexplain the $95$ GeV diphoton excess, the observed $125$ GeV Higgs mass, and\\nthe dark matter relic density, establishing a compelling and theoretically\\nconsistent framework.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T03:04:42Z\"}"}
