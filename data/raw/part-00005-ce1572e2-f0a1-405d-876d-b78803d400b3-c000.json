Motivated by this challenge,\\nframeworks for RAG hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) have recently emerged,\\nyet their effectiveness has not been rigorously benchmarked. To address this\\ngap, we present a comprehensive study involving 5 HPO algorithms over 5\\ndatasets from diverse domains, including a new one collected for this work on\\nreal-world product documentation. Our study explores the largest HPO search\\nspace considered to date, with two optimized evaluation metrics. Analysis of\\nthe results shows that RAG HPO can be done efficiently, either greedily or with\\niterative random search, and that it significantly boosts RAG performance for\\nall datasets. For greedy HPO approaches, we show that optimizing models first\\nis preferable to the prevalent practice of optimizing sequentially according to\\nthe RAG pipeline order.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T11:47:52Z\"}"}
