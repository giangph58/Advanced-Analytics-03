{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03538v1\", \"title\": \"RAIL: Region-Aware Instructive Learning for Semi-Supervised Tooth\\n  Segmentation in CBCT\", \"summary\": \"Semi-supervised learning has become a compelling approach for 3D tooth\\nsegmentation from CBCT scans, where labeled data is minimal. However, existing\\nmethods still face two persistent challenges: limited corrective supervision in\\nstructurally ambiguous or mislabeled regions during supervised training and\\nperformance degradation caused by unreliable pseudo-labels on unlabeled data.\\nTo address these problems, we propose Region-Aware Instructive Learning (RAIL),\\na dual-group dual-student, semi-supervised framework. Each group contains two\\nstudent models guided by a shared teacher network. By alternating training\\nbetween the two groups, RAIL promotes intergroup knowledge transfer and\\ncollaborative region-aware instruction while reducing overfitting to the\\ncharacteristics of any single model. Specifically, RAIL introduces two\\ninstructive mechanisms. Disagreement-Focused Supervision (DFS) Controller\\nimproves supervised learning by instructing predictions only within areas where\\nstudent outputs diverge from both ground truth and the best student, thereby\\nconcentrating supervision on structurally ambiguous or mislabeled areas. In the\\nunsupervised phase, Confidence-Aware Learning (CAL) Modulator reinforces\\nagreement in regions with high model certainty while reducing the effect of\\nlow-confidence predictions during training. This helps prevent our model from\\nlearning unstable patterns and improves the overall reliability of\\npseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on four CBCT tooth segmentation datasets\\nshow that RAIL surpasses state-of-the-art methods under limited annotation.
