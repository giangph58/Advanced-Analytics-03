Motivated by this, this paper\\naddresses the challenges of transmitting text prompts over erasure channels for\\na text-to-image AIGC task by developing the semantic segmentation and repeated\\ntransmission (SMART) algorithm. SMART groups words in text prompts into\\npackets, prioritizing the task-specific significance of semantics within these\\npackets, and optimizes the number of repeated transmissions. Simulation results\\nshow that SMART achieves higher similarities in received texts and generated\\nimages compared to a character-level packetization baseline, while reducing\\ncomputing latency by orders of magnitude compared to an exhaustive search\\nbaseline.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T05:14:40Z\"}"}
