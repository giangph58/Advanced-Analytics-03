We obtain\\nquantitative bounds on the environmental diffusion coefficient and ignition\\nkernels, identifying conditions under which fires either propagate across the\\nentire region or naturally extinguish.\\n  Our analysis also reveals that vertically translating solutions do not exist,\\nwhereas traveling wave solutions with a front moving at any prescribed velocity\\nalways exist for kernels that are either of mild intensity or short range.\\nThese traveling waves exhibit unbounded profiles.\\n  Although evolutionary unstable, these traveling waves demonstrate stability\\nunder perturbations localized in a small region.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T06:55:18Z\"}"}
