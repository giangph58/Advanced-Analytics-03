{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23742v1\", \"title\": \"On the Steady-State Distributionally Robust Kalman Filter\", \"summary\": \"State estimation in the presence of uncertain or data-driven noise\\ndistributions remains a critical challenge in control and robotics. Although\\nthe Kalman filter is the most popular choice, its performance degrades\\nsignificantly when distributional mismatches occur, potentially leading to\\ninstability or divergence. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel\\nsteady-state distributionally robust (DR) Kalman filter that leverages\\nWasserstein ambiguity sets to explicitly account for uncertainties in both\\nprocess and measurement noise distributions. Our filter achieves computational\\nefficiency by requiring merely the offline solution of a single convex\\nsemidefinite program, which yields a constant DR Kalman gain for robust state\\nestimation under distributional mismatches. Additionally, we derive explicit\\ntheoretical conditions on the ambiguity set radius that ensure the asymptotic\\nconvergence of the time-varying DR Kalman filter to the proposed steady-state\\nsolution. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our approach outperforms\\nexisting baseline filters in terms of robustness and accuracy across both\\nGaussian and non-Gaussian uncertainty scenarios, highlighting its significant\\npotential for real-world control and estimation applications.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T05:46:42Z\"}"}
