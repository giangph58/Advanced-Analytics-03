For the class of generalized random dot-product graphs, we\\nshow that a standard local differential privacy mechanism induces a specific\\ngeometric distortion in the latent positions. Leveraging this insight, we show\\nthat consistent recovery of the latent positions is achievable by appropriately\\nadjusting the statistical inference procedure for the privatized graph.\\nFurthermore, we prove that our procedure is nearly minimax-optimal under local\\nedge differential privacy constraints. Lastly, we show that this framework\\nallows for consistent recovery of geometric and topological information\\nunderlying the latent positions, as encoded in their persistence diagrams. Our\\nresults extend previous work from the private community detection literature to\\na substantially richer class of models and inferential tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,math.ST,stat.ML,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T06:02:02Z\"}"}
