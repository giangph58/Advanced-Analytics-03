In this paper, we introduce the concept of mobile D-MIMO\\n(MD-MIMO) network, a further extension of the D-MIMO technology where\\ndistributed antenna arrays are connected to the base station with a wireless\\nlink allowing all radio network nodes to be mobile. This approach significantly\\nimproves deployment flexibility and reduces operating costs, enabling the\\nnetwork to adapt to the highly dynamic nature of next-generation (NextG)\\nnetworks. We discuss use cases, system design, network architecture, and the\\nkey enabling technologies for MD-MIMO. Furthermore, we investigate a case study\\nof MD-MIMO for vehicular networks, presenting detailed performance evaluations\\nfor both downlink and uplink. The results show that an MD-MIMO network can\\nprovide substantial improvements in network throughput and reliability.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T16:48:29Z\"}"}
