Through\\nstate-selective ionization detection of the KRb molecules, we observe resonant\\nenergy transfer at 2.227 GHz from Rydberg atoms to molecules under a tunable\\nexternal electric field. We measure a broadening up to 3.5 MHz, for the Rb\\nRydberg excitation spectrum, which matches a Monte Carlo simulation that\\ndescribes a Rydberg atom and neighboring molecules evolving under a\\ndipole-dipole interacting Hamiltonian. The demonstrated interspecies dipolar\\ninteraction is a key ingredient for hybrid Rydberg-polar molecule systems,\\nwhere the advantages of each system can be leveraged and combined.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T15:31:02Z\"}"}
