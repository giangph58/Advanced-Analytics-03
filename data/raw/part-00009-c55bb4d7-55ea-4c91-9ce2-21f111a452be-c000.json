{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05033v1\", \"title\": \"CloSE: A Compact Shape- and Orientation-Agnostic Cloth State\\n  Representation\", \"summary\": \"Cloth manipulation is a difficult problem mainly because of the non-rigid\\nnature of cloth, which makes a good representation of deformation essential. We\\npresent a new representation for the deformation-state of clothes. First, we\\npropose the dGLI disk representation, based on topological indices computed for\\nsegments on the edges of the cloth mesh border that are arranged on a circular\\ngrid. The heat-map of the dGLI disk uncovers patterns that correspond to\\nfeatures of the cloth state that are consistent for different shapes, sizes of\\npositions of the cloth, like the corners and the fold locations. We then\\nabstract these important features from the dGLI disk onto a circle, calling it\\nthe Cloth StatE representation (CloSE). This representation is compact,\\ncontinuous, and general for different shapes. Finally, we show the strengths of\\nthis representation in two relevant applications: semantic labeling and high-\\nand low-level planning.
