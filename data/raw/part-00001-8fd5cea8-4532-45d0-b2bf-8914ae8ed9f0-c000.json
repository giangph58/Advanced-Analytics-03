This paper presents an initial approach to\\nincorporating sets of rules within a classifier. Our work is built on the work\\nof Canavotto et al. (2023), which has developed the rule-based reason model of\\nprecedential constraint within a hierarchy of factors. We demonstrate how\\ndecisions for new cases can be inferred using this enriched rule-based\\nclassifier framework. Additionally, we provide an example of how the time\\nelement and the hierarchy of courts can be used in the new classifier\\nframework.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T11:59:16Z\"}"}
