However, in order to be compatible with the existing\\nconstraints, the tension of a cosmic superstring network is required to lie\\nseveral orders of magnitude below the Planck scale. This is naturally realized\\nin string compactifications where the volume of the extra dimensions is\\nparametrically large (in string units). We estimate the GW spectrum arising\\nfrom cosmic superstrings in such scenarios, providing analytical formulae as\\nwell as numerical results. Crucially, we do so within a fully-fledged string\\ncosmology, taking into account various modified cosmological epochs (such as\\nkination or early matter domination) induced by the presence of moduli and a\\ntime-dependent string tension. We show that part of the spectrum generically\\nlies within reach of LISA and ET, with a large class of models predicting a\\ncharacteristic drop in the amplitude which may be robustly probed by LISA. The\\ncorresponding signal would encode information on the dynamics of moduli and\\nreheating. On the other hand, the ultra-high frequency part of the spectrum can\\nbe significantly enhanced by a long, early phase of kination with time-varying\\ntension, yielding a spectral index unique to this set-up.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:59:23Z\"}"}
