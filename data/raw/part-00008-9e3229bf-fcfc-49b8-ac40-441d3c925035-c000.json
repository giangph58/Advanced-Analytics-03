{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12809v1\", \"title\": \"Saliency-Aware Diffusion Reconstruction for Effective Invisible\\n  Watermark Removal\", \"summary\": \"As digital content becomes increasingly ubiquitous, the need for robust\\nwatermark removal techniques has grown due to the inadequacy of existing\\nembedding techniques, which lack robustness. This paper introduces a novel\\nSaliency-Aware Diffusion Reconstruction (SADRE) framework for watermark\\nelimination on the web, combining adaptive noise injection, region-specific\\nperturbations, and advanced diffusion-based reconstruction. SADRE disrupts\\nembedded watermarks by injecting targeted noise into latent representations\\nguided by saliency masks although preserving essential image features. A\\nreverse diffusion process ensures high-fidelity image restoration, leveraging\\nadaptive noise levels determined by watermark strength. Our framework is\\ntheoretically grounded with stability guarantees and achieves robust watermark\\nremoval across diverse scenarios. Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art\\n(SOTA) watermarking techniques demonstrate SADRE's superiority in balancing\\nwatermark disruption and image quality. SADRE sets a new benchmark for\\nwatermark elimination, offering a flexible and reliable solution for real-world\\nweb content.
