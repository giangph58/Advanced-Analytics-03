Here, we use Quantum Monte Carlo\\ncalculations to obtain the average single-site entanglement for the\\ntwo-dimensional Hubbard model in different geometries, probing the effects of\\nvarying temperature and interaction strength. We find that the average\\nsingle-site entanglement signals the quantum phase transitions in such systems,\\nallowing us to identify and characterize signatures of quantum phase\\ntransitions even at finite temperatures. We also analyze the relation between\\nentanglement and magnetic susceptibility: in all the geometries considered, we\\nfind regimes in which the quantities are linearly connected. Our findings could\\nthen guide experiments to estimate entanglement via the susceptibility.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T16:06:21Z\"}"}
