By leveraging the Energy-Distance (ED) kernel, which can\\nbe approximated by its sliced one-dimensional projections, each computable in\\nO(n log n), our method avoids hyperparameter tuning and enables efficient\\nlarge-scale optimization. The main issue to be solved is the lack of regularity\\nof the ED kernel. To this goal, we introduce two models that regularize the\\ndeformations and retain a low computational footprint. The first model relies\\non TV regularization, while the second model avoids the non-smooth TV\\nregularization at the cost of restricting its use to the space of measures, or\\ncloud of points. Last, we demonstrate the numerical robustness and scalability\\nof our models on synthetic and real data.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T09:12:06Z\"}"}
