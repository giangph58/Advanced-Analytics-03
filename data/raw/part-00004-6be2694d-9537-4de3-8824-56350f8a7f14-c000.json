Since the usual RFB still suffers from\\noscillations and strong under/overshoots, the bubble space is enriched by\\n\\\\emph{patch bubbles}, giving more freedom to the bubble space.\\n  We use a recursive and efficient approach to accurately compute the bubbles.\\nNumerical experiments clearly demonstrate the superiority of our method\\ncompared to the standard RFB.\\n  The method is similar to the \\\\emph{enhanced residual-free bubble} method\\n(eRFB) proposed by Cangiani and S\\\\\\\"uli in 2005, but differs in the definition\\nof the additional bubbles.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:46:14Z\"}"}
