{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11089v1\", \"title\": \"InfoClus: Informative Clustering of High-dimensional Data Embeddings\", \"summary\": \"Developing an understanding of high-dimensional data can be facilitated by\\nvisualizing that data using dimensionality reduction. However, the\\nlow-dimensional embeddings are often difficult to interpret. To facilitate the\\nexploration and interpretation of low-dimensional embeddings, we introduce a\\nnew concept named partitioning with explanations. The idea is to partition the\\ndata shown through the embedding into groups, each of which is given a sparse\\nexplanation using the original high-dimensional attributes. We introduce an\\nobjective function that quantifies how much we can learn through observing the\\nexplanations of the data partitioning, using information theory, and also how\\ncomplex the explanations are. Through parameterization of the complexity, we\\ncan tune the solutions towards the desired granularity. We propose InfoClus,\\nwhich optimizes the partitioning and explanations jointly, through greedy\\nsearch constrained over a hierarchical clustering. We conduct a qualitative and\\nquantitative analysis of InfoClus on three data sets. We contrast the results\\non the Cytometry data with published manual analysis results, and compare with\\ntwo other recent methods for explaining embeddings (RVX and VERA). These\\ncomparisons highlight that InfoClus has distinct advantages over existing\\nprocedures and methods. We find that InfoClus can automatically create good\\nstarting points for the analysis of dimensionality-reduction-based scatter\\nplots.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T11:34:03Z\"}"}
