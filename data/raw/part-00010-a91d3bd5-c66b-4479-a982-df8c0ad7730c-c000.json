We use the finite element method for spatial\\ndiscretization and the stochastic trigonometric method for time discretization\\nand derive a strong convergence rate with respect to both parameters (temporal\\nand spatial). Numerical experiments have also been performed to support\\ntheoretical bounds.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T08:02:07Z\"}"}
