Prominent\\nframeworks, such as the Di\\\\'osi-Penrose (DP) and Continuous Spontaneous\\nLocalization (CSL) models, propose a continuous, spontaneous measurement of the\\nmass density field of quantized matter. We show that this mechanism could link\\nboth models - not just DP - to fundamental uncertainties in Newtonian gravity.\\nDespite their non-relativistic nature, these models suggest an induced\\nuncertainty in the flow of time due to fluctuations in the Newtonian potential.\\nWe calculate the ultimate limit on time uncertainty and demonstrate that the\\nresulting clock-time uncertainty remains negligible for all contemporary\\ntime-keeping devices, including atomic clocks.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:55:50Z\"}"}
