We investigate how a dark photon\\nwith a larger decay width impacts these limits, in particular, in the case\\nwhere the dark photon also decays into light dark matter. As an example, taking\\nthe upper limits on the mixing parameter, $\\\\epsilon$, reported by the CMS\\ncollaboration, we find that they could be significantly relaxed. Indeed, even a\\nvery modest coupling of the dark photon to dark matter can lead to an increase\\nin the bound on the mixing parameter by an order of magnitude.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T07:12:42Z\"}"}
