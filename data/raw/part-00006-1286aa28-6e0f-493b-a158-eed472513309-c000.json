Specifically, we use the Fr\\\\'{e}chet mean, and metrics based on\\nthe optimal sub-pattern assignment (OSPA) construct, to extend the notion of\\naverage from vectors to trajectories and multi-object trajectories. Further, we\\ndevelop efficient algorithms to compute these means using greedy search and\\nGibbs sampling. Using distributed multi-object tracking as an application, we\\ndemonstrate that the Fr\\\\'{e}chet mean approach to multi-object trajectory\\nconsensus significantly outperforms state-of-the-art distributed multi-object\\ntracking methods.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T03:25:39Z\"}"}
