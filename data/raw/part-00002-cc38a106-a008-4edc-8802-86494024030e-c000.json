We begin with a very lucid\\nintroduction of Kitaev model and present its exact solution, Hilbert space\\nstructure, fractionalisation, spin-spin correlation function and topological\\ndegeneracy in an elementary way. We then discuss the recent proposal of\\nrealizing Kitaev interaction in certain materials. Finally we present some\\nrecent experiments done on these materials, mainly magnetization,\\nsusceptibility, specific heat and thermal Hall effect to elucidate the recent\\nstatus of material realization of coveted Kitaev spin-liquid phase. We end with\\na brief discussion on other theoretical works on Kitaev model from different\\nmany-body aspects.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T11:00:04Z\"}"}
