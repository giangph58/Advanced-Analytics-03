Yet, it\\nremains challenging due to the dielectric transparency and metal loss in\\noptical and near-infrared regimes. Here, we present a rotated hexagonal air\\ncavity embedded in an Ag-air-Ag waveguide. Under near-infrared excitation,\\nevanescent waves tunnel into the cavity. In addition to the whispering gallery\\nmode and surface plasmon polaritons, the cavity also induces Fabry-P\\\\'erot (FP)\\nresonance, whose orientation is tunable via cavity rotation. Thus, our cavity\\npossesses much stronger field confinement and higher Q than a circular cavity\\nlacking FP resonance. The waveguide exhibits suppressed backward reflection\\nfiltering and Fano-type lineshapes. Then, integrating a silicon cylinder into\\nthe cavity, we demonstrate linear tuning of Mie resonances via radius\\nadjustment. When the electric dipole (ED) resonance is excited, energy is\\npredominantly confined within the cylinder. Different Mie modes will change the\\norientation of the FP resonance. Furthermore, the hybrid modes with ED\\nresonance induce the third-harmonic wave of green light. These findings offer a\\npromising strategy for designing high-Q air cavities for next-generation\\nmultifunctional electro-optical devices.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T07:23:39Z\"}"}
