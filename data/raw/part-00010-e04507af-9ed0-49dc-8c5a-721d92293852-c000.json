We propose\\na novel eye-tracking approach based on incorporating passive eye-tracking\\nmodules into contact lenses. These modules comprise two superimposed gratings\\nseparated by a narrow gap. The overlapped gratings produce moir\\\\'e pattern,\\nwhile the spatial separation between them results in parallax effect, namely,\\npattern transformation upon variations in viewing angle, which enables accurate\\nangular measurements. This method is insensitive to ambient lighting conditions\\nand requires neither scale and color bars nor perspective corrections. Using\\nthis approach, we have experimentally measured lens orientation with angular\\nresolution exceeding 0.3{\\\\deg}, which is satisfactory for gaze detection in\\nmost AR/VR applications. Furthermore, the proposed technological platform holds\\na potential for many-fold enhancement in measurement precision.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T11:37:24Z\"}"}
