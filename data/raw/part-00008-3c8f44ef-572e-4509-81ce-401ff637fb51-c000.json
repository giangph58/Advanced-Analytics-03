The goal is to address the emerging\\nwealth distribution when economic rules are not the same for all individuals.\\nIndividuals exchange wealth in pairwise interactions with no underlying\\nlattice. The wealth, risk aversion factor, and group of the agents characterize\\ntheir state. The wealth exchanged between two agents obeys a fair rule: the\\nquantities put at stake by them are the same regardless of who wins. One agent\\ncan interact with another agent in the same or the other group, controlled by a\\nrate which is a parameter of the model. Inter-group exchanges obey an exclusive\\nprotection rule, which can be understood as a public policy to reduce\\ninequality. We show that the most protected group accumulates more wealth, has\\nless inequality, and has higher mobility than the other group. The results of\\nsimulations are compared with income distribution in Brazil discriminated by\\nrace as an example of the application our model.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:46:01Z\"}"}
