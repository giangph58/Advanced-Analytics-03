In this paper, we propose a\\nnovel attack detection framework for HVAC systems, integrating an\\nEvent-Triggering Unit (ETU) for local monitoring and a cloud-based\\nclassification system using the Graph Attention Network (GAT) and the Long\\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The ETU performs a binary classification to\\nidentify potential anomalies and selectively triggers encrypted data\\ntransmission to the cloud, significantly reducing communication cost. The\\ncloud-side GAT module models the spatial relationships among HVAC components,\\nwhile the LSTM module captures temporal dependencies across encrypted state\\nsequences to classify the attack type. Our approach is evaluated on datasets\\nthat simulate diverse attack scenarios. Compared to GAT-only (94.2% accuracy)\\nand LSTM-only (91.5%) ablations, our full GAT-LSTM model achieves 98.8% overall\\ndetection accuracy and reduces data transmission to 15%. These results\\ndemonstrate that the proposed framework achieves high detection accuracy while\\npreserving data privacy by using the spatial-temporal characteristics of HVAC\\nsystems and minimizing transmission costs through event-triggered\\ncommunication.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T14:11:36Z\"}"}
