However, destructive diagnostics must be avoided in superconducting\\nsections to prevent the occurrence of particulates and outgassing, rendering\\ndirect measurements of the beam envelope particularly challenging. This study\\npresents a non-destructive method that uses beam position monitors (BPMs) to\\nestimate the transverse beam envelope based on measurements of the quadrupole\\nmoment of the beam distribution. Although this concept was originally proposed\\nin the 1980s, its application, especially to hadron beams, has been limited\\nbecause of low signal sensitivity and the accuracy constraints associated with\\nconventional BPM geometries. To overcome these challenges, we employed\\n$\\\\cos{2\\\\theta}$-type BPMs, which offer improved sensitivity to quadrupole\\ncomponents and are well-suited for low-$\\\\beta$ heavy ion beams. This method was\\napplied to the heavy ion beams in the superconducting RIKEN linac (SRILAC), for\\nwhich data from eight BPMs were combined with transfer matrix calculations and\\nsupplemental wire scanner data. The resulting beam envelope estimates exhibited\\ngood agreement with conventional quadrupole scan results, demonstrating the\\nfeasibility of this technique for routine, non-destructive beam monitoring in\\nsuperconducting accelerator sections.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.acc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.acc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T08:35:42Z\"}"}
