{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19801v1\", \"title\": \"Stochastic quantum adiabatic algorithm with fractional Brownian motion\", \"summary\": \"Adiabatic Quantum Computing relies on the quantum adiabatic theorem, which\\nstates that a quantum system evolves along its ground state with time if the\\ngoverning Hamiltonian varies infinitely slowly. However, practical limitations\\nforce computations to be performed within limited times, exposing the system to\\ntransitions into excited states, and thereby reducing the success probability.\\nHere we investigate the counterintuitive hypothesis that incorporating\\nstochastic noise, specifically noise driven by fractional Brownian motion, in a\\nnon-Markovian setup can enhance the performance of adiabatic quantum computing\\nby improving its success probability at limited evolution times. The study\\nbegins by developing the mathematical framework to introduce stochastic noise\\nmultiplicatively into the Schr\\\\\\\"{o}dinger equation, resulting in a stochastic\\nSchr\\\\\\\"{o}dinger equation. To preserve It\\\\^{o} integrability within the\\nnon-Markovian framework, a semimartingale approximation for fractional Brownian\\nmotion is employed. We perform numerical simulations to compare the performance\\nof the quantum adiabatic algorithm with and without noise driven by fractional\\nBrownian motion using the NP-complete Exact Cover-3 problem, transformed into\\nthe Ising model. Our results exhibit an improvement in success probability in\\nthe presence of noise driven by fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter\\n$0<H<\\\\frac{1}{2}$ and an increase in speedup as $H$ approaches 0. Although\\nsimulations are limited to problems involving a modest number of qubits,\\nevidence suggests that the proposed approach scales favorably with the system\\nsize.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T13:51:16Z\"}"}
