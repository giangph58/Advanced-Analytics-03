{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10184v1\", \"title\": \"Dispatching Odyssey: Exploring Performance in Computing Clusters under\\n  Real-world Workloads\", \"summary\": \"Recent workload measurements in Google data centers provide an opportunity to\\nchallenge existing models and, more broadly, to enhance the understanding of\\ndispatching policies in computing clusters. Through extensive data-driven\\nsimulations, we aim to highlight the key features of workload traffic traces\\nthat influence response time performance under simple yet representative\\ndispatching policies. For a given computational power budget, we vary the\\ncluster size, i.e., the number of available servers. A job-level analysis\\nreveals that Join Idle Queue (JIQ) and Least Work Left (LWL) exhibit an optimal\\nworking point for a fixed utilization coefficient as the number of servers is\\nvaried, whereas Round Robin (RR) demonstrates monotonously worsening\\nperformance. Additionally, we explore the accuracy of simple G/G queue\\napproximations. When decomposing jobs into tasks, interesting results emerge;\\nnotably, the simpler, non-size-based policy JIQ appears to outperform the more\\n\\\"powerful\\\" size-based LWL policy. Complementing these findings, we present\\npreliminary results on a two-stage scheduling approach that partitions tasks\\nbased on service thresholds, illustrating that modest architectural\\nmodifications can further enhance performance under realistic workload\\nconditions. We provide insights into these results and suggest promising\\ndirections for fully explaining the observed phenomena.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T12:38:33Z\"}"}
