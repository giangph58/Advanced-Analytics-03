However, setting jointly digital and analog\\nprecoders to optimally serve multiple users is a difficult optimization\\nproblem. Moreover, it relies heavily on precise knowledge of the channels,\\nwhich is difficult to obtain, especially when considering realistic systems\\ncomprising hardware impairments. In this paper, a joint channel estimation and\\nhybrid precoding method is proposed, which consists in an end-to-end\\narchitecture taking received pilots as inputs and outputting precoders. The\\nresulting neural network is fully model-based, making it lightweight and\\ninterpretable with very few learnable parameters. The channel estimation step\\nis performed using the unfolded matching pursuit algorithm, accounting for\\nimperfect knowledge of the antenna system, while the precoding step is done via\\nunfolded projected gradient ascent. The great potential of the proposed method\\nis empirically demonstrated on realistic synthetic channels.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T09:00:34Z\"}"}
