The conventional method of diagnosis using liver biopsy is\\ninvasive and, therefore, inconvenient for use in regular screening. In this\\npaper,we present a hybrid model that combines machine learning techniques with\\nclinical data and ultrasoundscans to improve liver fibrosis and cirrhosis\\ndetection accuracy is presented. The model integrates fixed blood test\\nprobabilities with deep learning model predictions (DenseNet-201) for\\nultrasonic images. The combined hybrid model achieved an accuracy of 92.5%. The\\nfindings establish the viability of the combined model in enhancing diagnosis\\naccuracy and supporting early intervention in liver disease care.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T12:54:51Z\"}"}
