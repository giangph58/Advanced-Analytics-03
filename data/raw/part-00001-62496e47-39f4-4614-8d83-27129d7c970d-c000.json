We show that finding a feasible matching is NP-hard,\\nmaking finding a feasible and stable matching automatically NP-hard. We then\\nanalyze the subproblem where all the projects have the same capacity, and the\\napplicant population of each location is a multiple of the universal project\\ncapacity, which mimics more realistic constraints and makes finding a feasible\\nmatching in P. Even under these conditions, a stable matching (a matching\\nwithout blocking pairs) may not exist, so we look for a matching that minimizes\\nthe number of blocking pairs. We find that the blocking pair minimization\\nproblem for this subproblem is inapproximable within $|A|^{1-\\\\epsilon}$ for\\n$|A|$ agents and provide an $|A|$-approximation algorithm to show this result\\nis almost tight. We extend this result to show that the problem of minimizing\\nthe number of agents in blocking pairs is also inapproximable within\\n$|A|^{1-\\\\epsilon}$, and since there are only $|A|$ agents, this result is also\\nalmost tight.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T16:26:31Z\"}"}
