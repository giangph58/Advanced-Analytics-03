Yet, in many\\nsettings, in-domain monolingual target-side corpora are often available. This\\nwork explores ways to take advantage of such resources by retrieving relevant\\nsegments directly in the target language, based on a source-side query. For\\nthis, we design improved cross-lingual retrieval systems, trained with both\\nsentence level and word-level matching objectives. In our experiments with two\\nRANMT architectures, we first demonstrate the benefits of such cross-lingual\\nobjectives in a controlled setting, obtaining translation performances that\\nsurpass standard TM-based models. We then showcase our method on a real-world\\nset-up, where the target monolingual resources far exceed the amount of\\nparallel data and observe large improvements of our new techniques, which\\noutperform both the baseline setting, and general-purpose cross-lingual\\nretrievers.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,I.2.7\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T15:41:03Z\"}"}
