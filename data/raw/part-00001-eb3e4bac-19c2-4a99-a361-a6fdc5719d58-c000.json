{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11055v1\", \"title\": \"Crane: Context-Guided Prompt Learning and Attention Refinement for\\n  Zero-Shot Anomaly Detections\", \"summary\": \"Anomaly Detection (AD) involves identifying deviations from normal data\\ndistributions and is critical in fields such as medical diagnostics and\\nindustrial defect detection. Traditional AD methods typically require the\\navailability of normal training samples; however, this assumption is not always\\nfeasible, as collecting such data can be impractical. Additionally, these\\nmethods often struggle to generalize across different domains. Recent\\nadvancements, such as AnomalyCLIP and AdaCLIP, utilize the zero-shot\\ngeneralization capabilities of CLIP but still face a performance gap between\\nimage-level and pixel-level anomaly detection. To address this gap, we propose\\na novel approach that conditions the prompts of the text encoder based on image\\ncontext extracted from the vision encoder. Also, to capture fine-grained\\nvariations more effectively, we have modified the CLIP vision encoder and\\naltered the extraction of dense features. These changes ensure that the\\nfeatures retain richer spatial and structural information for both normal and\\nanomalous prompts. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving\\nperformance by 2% to 29% across different metrics on 14 datasets. This\\ndemonstrates its effectiveness in both image-level and pixel-level anomaly\\ndetection.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T10:42:25Z\"}"}
