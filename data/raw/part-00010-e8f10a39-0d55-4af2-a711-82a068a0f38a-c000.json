Then we derive converse results by characterizing new properties\\nof secure coded caching schemes. As a result, we characterize the two\\nend-points of the optimal memory-rate tradeoff curve for arbitrary number of\\nusers and files. Furthermore, for the case of $N=2$ files and arbitrary number\\nof users, we also characterize a segment of the optimal memory-rate tradeoff\\ncurve, where the cache size is relatively small.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T09:03:45Z\"}"}
