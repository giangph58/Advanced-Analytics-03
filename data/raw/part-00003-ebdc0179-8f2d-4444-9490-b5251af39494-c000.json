{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12015v1\", \"title\": \"Power Line Communication vs. Talkative Power Conversion: A Benchmarking\\n  Study\", \"summary\": \"The convergence of energy transmission and data communication has become a\\nkey feature of decentralized energy systems across a broad spectrum of\\nvoltage/power ranges, including smart grid applications and cyber-physical\\npower systems. This paper compares two distinct approaches: Power Line\\nCommunications (PLC) and Talkative Power Conversion (TPC). While PLC leverages\\nexisting power infrastructure for data transmission by using external data\\ntransmitters and receivers, TPC integrates communication capabilities directly\\ninto power electronic converters. We present their technical foundations and\\napplications, benchmark their strengths and bottlenecks, and outline future\\nresearch directions regarding TPC that could bridge the gap between power and\\ncommunication technologies.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T12:15:42Z\"}"}
