This ensures controlled write access while preserving public\\ntransparency. By incorporating smart contracts, the system supports key\\nfeatures such as embargoed disclosures and decentralized governance. We\\nevaluate the proposed model in comparison with existing practices, highlighting\\nits advantages in transparency, trust decentralization, and auditability. A\\nprototype implementation using Hyperledger Fabric is presented to demonstrate\\nthe feasibility of the approach, along with a discussion of its implications\\nfor the future of vulnerability disclosure.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T12:12:08Z\"}"}
