In our extraction of the\\ndeuteron mass radius, we employ a dipole-form scalar gravitational form factor\\nto effectively model the $|t|$-dependence of the differential cross sections\\nassociated with vector meson photoproductions. Utilizing the vector-meson\\ndominance model alongside a low-energy Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) theorem\\nassumption, we derive the deuteron mass radius from the near-threshold\\nphotoproduction data of the $\\\\rho^0$, $\\\\omega$, and $\\\\phi$ mesons. The mass\\nradii obtained from various datasets demonstrate consistency within the\\nstatistical uncertainties, yielding an average value of $2.07 \\\\pm 0.15$ fm.\\nThis precision surpasses previous estimates solely based on the $\\\\phi$ meson\\nphotoproduction data. Our findings provide novel constraints for theoretical\\nnuclear structure models and significantly enhance our understanding of the\\nmass distribution within the deuteron.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,nucl-ex,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:27:15Z\"}"}
