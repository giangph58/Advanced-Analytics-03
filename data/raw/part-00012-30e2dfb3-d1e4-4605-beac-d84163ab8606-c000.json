The\\n  spectroscopic sample and 6D kinematics\", \"summary\": \"We present results from a large spectroscopic survey of the nearest young\\nassociation to the Sun, Upper Scorpius, conducted using 2dF/HERMES on the\\nAnglo-Australian Telescope. We use spectroscopic youth criteria such as\\nLi-equivalent widths to identify >1000 pre-main sequence (PMS) members across\\nthe region and measure radial velocities, combining these with Gaia EDR3\\n5-parameter astrometry to obtain 6D kinematic information. We separate\\nconfirmed PMS association members into distinct kinematic groups and measure\\nexpansion and rotation trends in each. We find strong evidence for asymmetric\\nexpansion in several groups and derive expansion timescales from the greatest\\nrates of expansion in each group. We also trace the past motion of these groups\\nusing an epicycle approximation and estimate the time since their most compact\\nconfiguration. These kinematic properties are compared to literature ages and\\nthe star formation history of Upper Scorpius is discussed. We find evidence\\nthat a scenario in which star formation in the subgroups of Upper Scorpius\\nproceeded independently, either by self-instability or external feedback from\\nUpper Centaurus-Lupus, is more likely than a recently proposed \\\"cluster chain\\\"\\nscenario in which these subgroups have triggered each other.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T17:40:55Z\"}"}
