In the same spirit,\\nin this paper we introduce a generalized version of Fisher information, named\\nas the R\\\\'enyi--Fisher information, which is the half of the derivative of\\nR\\\\'enyi information along heat flow. Based on this R\\\\'enyi--Fisher information,\\nwe establish sharp R\\\\'enyi-entropic isoperimetric inequalities, which\\ngeneralize the classic entropic isoperimetric inequality to the R\\\\'enyi\\nsetting. Utilizing these isoperimetric inequalities, we extend the classical\\nCram\\\\'er--Rao inequality from Fisher information to R\\\\'enyi--Fisher\\ninformation. Lastly, we use these generalized Cram\\\\'er--Rao inequalities to\\ndetermine the signs of derivatives of entropy along heat flow, strengthening\\nexisting results on the complete monotonicity of entropy.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT,math.PR,math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:44:02Z\"}"}
