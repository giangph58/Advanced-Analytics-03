Using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology campus as a\\ncase study, we find that, similar to the baseline metabolism of biological\\norganisms, large buildings are on average $25\\\\%$ more energetically efficient\\nper unit size than smaller buildings. This suggests that institutions can be\\nperceived as super populations with buildings as units (organisms) following\\nstandard metabolic relationships. Importantly, the relative efficiency of\\nlarger buildings progressively increased to $34\\\\%$ until 2020. However, the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic acted as a major shock, disrupting this trend and leading to\\na reversal to the expected $25\\\\%$ baseline level. This suggests that energetic\\nadaptations are contingent on relatively stable conditions.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph,nlin.AO,stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:55:48Z\"}"}
