{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21771v1\", \"title\": \"Anatomical Similarity as a New Metric to Evaluate Brain Generative\\n  Models\", \"summary\": \"Generative models enhance neuroimaging through data augmentation, quality\\nimprovement, and rare condition studies. Despite advances in realistic\\nsynthetic MRIs, evaluations focus on texture and perception, lacking\\nsensitivity to crucial anatomical fidelity. This study proposes a new metric,\\ncalled WASABI (Wasserstein-Based Anatomical Brain Index), to assess the\\nanatomical realism of synthetic brain MRIs. WASABI leverages \\\\textit{SynthSeg},\\na deep learning-based brain parcellation tool, to derive volumetric measures of\\nbrain regions in each MRI and uses the multivariate Wasserstein distance to\\ncompare distributions between real and synthetic anatomies. Based on controlled\\nexperiments on two real datasets and synthetic MRIs from five generative\\nmodels, WASABI demonstrates higher sensitivity in quantifying anatomical\\ndiscrepancies compared to traditional image-level metrics, even when synthetic\\nimages achieve near-perfect visual quality. Our findings advocate for shifting\\nthe evaluation paradigm beyond visual inspection and conventional metrics,\\nemphasizing anatomical fidelity as a crucial benchmark for clinically\\nmeaningful brain MRI synthesis.
