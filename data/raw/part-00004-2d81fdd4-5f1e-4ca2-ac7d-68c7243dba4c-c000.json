These\\nSUSY transformations connect pairs of Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonians\\ncharacterized by different detuning parameters as well as Jaynes-Cummings to\\nanti-Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonians. Therefore, JC Hamiltonians can be classified\\nin hierarchies or sequences which are connected through SUSY transformations.\\nAs a byproduct, the symmetries of JC Hamiltonians are found as well as the\\nspecial case of a sequence of resonant-like interacting systems having the form\\nof a simple shape invariant JC Hamiltonian hierarchy.\", \"main_category\": \"math-ph\", \"categories\": \"math-ph,math.MP,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:13:17Z\"}"}
