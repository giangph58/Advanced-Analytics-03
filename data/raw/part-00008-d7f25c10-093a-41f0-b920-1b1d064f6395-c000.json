However, doing so in a timely manner can be difficult to accomplish in\\nvery large courses. Recent work has explored different types of automated\\nfeedback adapted to different languages and programming paradigms, particularly\\nlogic programming. In ProHelp, we implemented several of these types of\\nfeedback so that they could be used by students enrolled in a logic programming\\nclass. Then, we surveyed those students to find if the feedback was useful and\\nwhich types of feedback they preferred. Results show that students found all\\ntypes of feedback helpful, with automatic testing, in particular, being the\\nmost helpful type. We also explore student preferences for which types of\\nfeedback they would most like to see implemented in the future.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T14:11:54Z\"}"}
