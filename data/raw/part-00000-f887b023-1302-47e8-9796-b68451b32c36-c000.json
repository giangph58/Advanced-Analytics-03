This model extends previous models for the\\nincompressible regime to subsonic bulk Mach numbers. A Lagrangian model for the\\nlocal pseudo-turbulent Reynolds stress around a particle, based on the\\ncorrelation of a local estimate of the Reynolds stress and the drag force on\\nthe particle, is also presented. This model can be employed in Euler-Lagrange\\ntype simulations. Additionally, corresponding models for the pseudo-turbulent\\ntransport of turbulence kinetic energy, the velocity triple-correlation in the\\nvolume averaged total energy equation, is also introduced as a first effort\\naimed at closing the energy equation.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T07:35:27Z\"}"}
