PCA induces a signal loss in the estimated power\\nspectrum, which can be corrected by a transfer function (TF). By injecting mock\\nsignals of HI into the data and performing the PCA cleaning, we can use the\\ncleaned mock HI signal to cross-correlate with the original mock, and estimate\\nthe signal loss as a TF, $T(\\\\vec{k})$. As expected, a correction of\\n${T}(\\\\vec{k})^{-1}$ restores the cross-power between the HI and optical\\ngalaxies. However, contrary to intuition, the HI auto-power also requires a\\n${T}(\\\\vec{k})^{-1}$ correction, not ${T}(\\\\vec{k})^{-2}$. The\\n${T}(\\\\vec{k})^{-1}$ correction is only known empirically through simulations.\\nIn this Letter, we show that the ${T}(\\\\vec{k})^{-1}$ correction in auto-power\\nis universal, and can be analytically proven using the quadratic estimator\\nformalism through window function normalisation. The normalisation can also be\\nused to determine the TF correction for any type of linear process. Using the\\nwindow function, we demonstrate that PCA induces mode-mixing in the power\\nspectrum estimation, which may lead to biases in the model inference.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T16:31:14Z\"}"}
