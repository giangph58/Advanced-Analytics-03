{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11005v1\", \"title\": \"Chiral Domain Walls Induced by Radially Magnetized Nanotube Geometry\", \"summary\": \"We theoretically investigate chiral domain walls (DWs) formed in radially\\nmagnetized nanotubes with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). Unlike tubes\\nwith an easy axis of magnetization oriented in other directions, radially\\nmagnetized tubes exhibit geometrical effects arising not only from exchange\\ninteractions but also from magnetostatic interactions, which lead to\\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI)-like effects. We derive expressions for\\nthe effective magnetic fields acting on DWs within PMA nanotubes and quantify\\nSOT-driven DW motion using an analytical one-dimensional model, which is\\nvalidated by micromagnetic simulations. Our results show that the DMI-like\\nfield due to magnetostatic interactions can be as significantly as the\\ncontribution of the material-induced DMI in nanotubes with diameters below\\n100$\\\\,$nm. This implies that the direction and speed of DW motion in PMA\\nnanotubes could differ from those observed in nanoribbons composed of the same\\nmaterial. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DW velocity can be effectively\\ncontrolled by adjusting the tube diameter and exchange stiffness constant of\\nthe magnetic layer, rather than relying solely on the material-induced DMI.\\nThese insights are expected to greatly expand the potential applications of PMA\\nnanotube-based DW devices.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T09:22:10Z\"}"}
