{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17443v1\", \"title\": \"Morphisms and BWT-run Sensitivity\", \"summary\": \"We study how the application of injective morphisms affects the number $r$ of\\nequal-letter runs in the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT). This parameter has\\nemerged as a key repetitiveness measure in compressed indexing. We focus on the\\nnotion of BWT-run sensitivity after application of an injective morphism. For\\nbinary alphabets, we characterize the class of morphisms that preserve the\\nnumber of BWT-runs up to a bounded additive increase, by showing that it\\ncoincides with the known class of primitivity-preserving morphisms, which are\\nthose that map primitive words to primitive words. We further prove that\\ndeciding whether a given binary morphism has bounded BWT-run sensitivity is\\npossible in polynomial time with respect to the total length of the images of\\nthe two letters. Additionally, we explore new structural and combinatorial\\nproperties of synchronizing and recognizable morphisms. These results establish\\nnew connections between BWT-based compressibility, code theory, and symbolic\\ndynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.FL\", \"categories\": \"cs.FL,cs.DM,cs.DS,math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T11:13:13Z\"}"}
