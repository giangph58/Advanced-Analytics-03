{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12882v1\", \"title\": \"ViClaim: A Multilingual Multilabel Dataset for Automatic Claim Detection\\n  in Videos\", \"summary\": \"The growing influence of video content as a medium for communication and\\nmisinformation underscores the urgent need for effective tools to analyze\\nclaims in multilingual and multi-topic settings. Existing efforts in\\nmisinformation detection largely focus on written text, leaving a significant\\ngap in addressing the complexity of spoken text in video transcripts. We\\nintroduce ViClaim, a dataset of 1,798 annotated video transcripts across three\\nlanguages (English, German, Spanish) and six topics. Each sentence in the\\ntranscripts is labeled with three claim-related categories: fact-check-worthy,\\nfact-non-check-worthy, or opinion. We developed a custom annotation tool to\\nfacilitate the highly complex annotation process. Experiments with\\nstate-of-the-art multilingual language models demonstrate strong performance in\\ncross-validation (macro F1 up to 0.896) but reveal challenges in generalization\\nto unseen topics, particularly for distinct domains. Our findings highlight the\\ncomplexity of claim detection in video transcripts. ViClaim offers a robust\\nfoundation for advancing misinformation detection in video-based communication,\\naddressing a critical gap in multimodal analysis.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T12:14:38Z\"}"}
