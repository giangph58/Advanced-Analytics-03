{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16393v1\", \"title\": \"An Explicit and Efficient $O(n^2)$-Time Algorithm for Sorting Sumsets\", \"summary\": \"We present the first explicit comparison-based algorithm that sorts the\\nsumset $X + Y = \\\\{x_i + y_j,\\\\ \\\\forall 0 \\\\le i, j < n\\\\}$, where $X$ and $Y$ are\\nsorted arrays of real numbers, in optimal $O(n^2)$ time and comparisons. While\\nFredman (1976) proved the theoretical existence of such an algorithm, a\\nconcrete construction has remained open for nearly five decades. Our algorithm\\nexploits the structured monotonicity of the sumset matrix to perform amortized\\nconstant-comparisons and insertions, eliminating the $\\\\log(n)$ overhead typical\\nof comparison-based sorting. We prove correctness and optimality in the\\nstandard comparison model, extend the method to $k$-fold sumsets with $O(n^k)$\\nperformance, and outline potential support for dynamic updates. Experimental\\nbenchmarks show significant speedups over classical algorithms such as\\nMergeSort and QuickSort when applied to sumsets. These results resolve a\\nlongstanding open problem in sorting theory and contribute novel techniques for\\nexploiting input structure in algorithm design.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS,cs.DM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T03:42:17Z\"}"}
