For the magnetic field parallel to the junction\\nplane, we demonstrate characteristic spin-valve hysteresis with mirrored\\ndifferential resistance $dV/dI$ peaks even at room temperature. In contrast,\\nfor normal magnetic fields spin-valve effect appears only at low temperatures.\\nFrom the magnetic field anisotropy, observation of the similar effect for\\nanother topological semimetal Cd$_3$As$_2$, and strictly flat $dV/dI(H)$\\nmagnetoresistance curves for the reference GeTe-Au junction, we connect the\\nobserved spin-valve effect with the spin-dependent scattering between the spin\\ntextures in the topological surface states and the ferromagnetic nickel\\nelectrode. For the topological semimetal $\\\\alpha$-GeTe, room-temperature\\nspin-valve effect allows efficient spin-to-charge conversion even at ambient\\nconditions.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:49:28Z\"}"}
