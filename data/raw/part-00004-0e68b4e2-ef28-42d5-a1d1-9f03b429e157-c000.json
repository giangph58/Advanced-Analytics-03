However, their rarity\\nresults in highly imbalanced datasets, posing challenges for AI-based detection\\nand severity quantification. We propose BetaMixer, a novel deep learning model\\nthat addresses these challenges through a Beta distribution-based mixing\\napproach, converting discrete IAE severity scores into continuous values for\\nprecise severity regression (0-5 scale). BetaMixer employs Beta\\ndistribution-based sampling to enhance underrepresented classes and regularizes\\nintermediate embeddings to maintain a structured feature space. A generative\\napproach aligns the feature space with sampled IAE severity, enabling robust\\nclassification and severity regression via a transformer. Evaluated on the\\nMultiBypass140 dataset, which we extended with IAE labels, BetaMixer achieves a\\nweighted F1 score of 0.76, recall of 0.81, PPV of 0.73, and NPV of 0.84,\\ndemonstrating strong performance on imbalanced data. By integrating Beta\\ndistribution-based sampling, feature mixing, and generative modeling, BetaMixer\\noffers a robust solution for IAE detection and quantification in clinical\\nsettings.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T14:18:02Z\"}"}
