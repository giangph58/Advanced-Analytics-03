{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09979v1\", \"title\": \"Resampling Benchmark for Efficient Comprehensive Evaluation of Large\\n  Vision-Language Models\", \"summary\": \"We propose an efficient evaluation protocol for large vision-language models\\n(VLMs). Given their broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities, multiple\\nbenchmarks are needed for comprehensive assessment, making evaluation\\ncomputationally expensive. To improve efficiency, we construct a subset that\\nyields results comparable to full benchmark evaluations. Our benchmark\\nclassification experiments reveal that no single benchmark fully covers all\\nchallenges. We then introduce a subset construction method using farthest point\\nsampling (FPS). Our experiments show that FPS-based benchmarks maintain a\\nstrong correlation (> 0.96) with full evaluations while using only ~1\\\\% of the\\ndata. Additionally, applying FPS to an existing benchmark improves correlation\\nwith overall evaluation results, suggesting its potential to reduce unintended\\ndataset biases.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T08:43:00Z\"}"}
