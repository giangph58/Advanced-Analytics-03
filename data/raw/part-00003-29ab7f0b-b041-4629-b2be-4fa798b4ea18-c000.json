As a result, topological defects on non-orientable manifolds give\\nrise to novel physical phenomena. We study the adiabatic transport of\\nexceptional points (EPs) along non-orientable closed loops and uncover distinct\\ntopological responses arising from the lack of global orientation. Notably, we\\ndemonstrate that the cyclic permutation of eigenstates across an EP depends\\nsensitively on the loop orientation, yielding inequivalent braid\\nrepresentations for clockwise and counterclockwise encirclement; this is a\\nfeature unique to non-orientable geometries. Orientation-dependent geometric\\nquantities, such as the winding number, cannot be consistently defined due to\\nthe absence of a global orientation. However, when a boundary is introduced,\\nsuch quantities become well defined within the local interior, even though the\\nglobal manifold remains non-orientable. We further demonstrate the adiabatic\\nevolution of EPs and the emergence of orientation-sensitive observables in a\\nKlein Brillouin zone, described by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian that\\npreserves momentum-space glide symmetry. Finally, we numerically implement\\nthese ideas in a microdisk cavity with embedded scatterers using synthetic\\nmomenta.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,cond-mat.mes-hall,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T11:26:05Z\"}"}
