Including moisture changes the character of the convection, with\\ncondensation providing a source of buoyancy via latent heating. The climate\\nchange model is set up by imposing a variable radiative cooling rate,\\nprescribing surface temperature and relative humidity, and imposing a\\nmoist-pseudoadiabatic profile at the top boundary (a flux boundary condition).\\nThe model is analysed across the climate parameter space by examining\\ndiagnostics of the model's basic state, and its stability, with Convective\\nAvailable Potential Energy (CAPE) calculations and a linear stability analysis.\\nWe use the linear stability results to identify new parameters relevant for\\nthis moist convective system, and to understand how the linear instability\\nresponds to the climate parameters. In particular, we define the \\\"Rainy number\\\"\\nas a scaled ratio of positive-area CAPE and diffusion parameters. An\\nalternative radiative-based Rainy number also is shown to describe the\\nparameter space, especially for problems relating to changes in flux\\nconditions. The analysis provides a novel theoretical understanding of how the\\ndynamics and scales of moist convection and hence precipitation will change\\nunder climate change.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn,physics.ao-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:25:54Z\"}"}
