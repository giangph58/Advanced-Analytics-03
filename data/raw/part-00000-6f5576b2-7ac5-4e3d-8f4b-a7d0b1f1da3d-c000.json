Instead of relying on the analytical solution to\\nthe diffusion equation, which accounts for all possible reflections and has a\\nsignificantly complex form, we propose a simpler method that considers the\\nreflected energy originating from a limited number of image sources, making it\\neasier to perform curve fitting and obtain diffusive properties. Our\\nexperimental findings highlight that distant image sources have a negligible\\neffect on the acquired diffusive properties, suggesting that the number of\\nimage sources considered should be determined based on their maximum\\ncontribution to the main energy. Additionally, failing to account for the\\nreflected energy during the fitting process results in an underestimation of\\nboth the diffusivity and dissipation. The obtained diffusive properties can be\\nused to evaluate damage in concrete.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.class-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.class-ph,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T08:59:13Z\"}"}
