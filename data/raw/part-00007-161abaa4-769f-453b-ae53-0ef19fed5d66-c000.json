A revealed preference\\n  study\", \"summary\": \"To determine the optimal locations for electric vehicle charging stations,\\noptimisation models need to predict which charging stations users will select.\\nWe estimate discrete choice models to predict the usage of charging stations\\nusing only readily available information for charging network operators. Our\\nparameter values are estimated from a unique, revealed preferences dataset of\\ncharging sessions in Montreal, Quebec. We find that user distance to stations,\\nproximity to home areas, and the number of outlets at each station are\\nsignificant factors for predicting station usage. Additionally, amenities near\\ncharging stations have a neutral effect overall, with some users demonstrating\\nstrong preference or aversion for these locations. High variability among the\\npreferences of users highlight the importance of models which incorporate panel\\neffects. Moreover, integrating mixed logit models within the optimization of\\ncharging station network design yields high-quality solutions, even when\\nevaluated under other model specifications.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T16:34:13Z\"}"}
