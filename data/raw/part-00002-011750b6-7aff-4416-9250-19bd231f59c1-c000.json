{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11941v1\", \"title\": \"Admissible matchings and the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of\\n  square-free powers\", \"summary\": \"Let $I$ be any square-free monomial ideal, and $\\\\mathcal{H}_I$ denote the\\nhypergraph associated with $I$. Refining the concept of $k$-admissible matching\\nof a graph defined by Erey and Hibi, we introduce the notion of generalized\\n$k$-admissible matching for any hypergraph. Using this, we give a sharp lower\\nbound on the (Castelnuovo-Mumford) regularity of $I^{[k]}$, where $I^{[k]}$\\ndenotes the $k^{\\\\text{th}}$ square-free power of $I$. In the special case when\\n$I$ is equigenerated in degree $d$, this lower bound can be described using a\\ncombinatorial invariant $\\\\mathrm{aim}(\\\\mathcal{H}_I,k)$, called the\\n$k$-admissible matching number of $\\\\mathcal{H}_I$. Specifically, we prove that\\n$\\\\mathrm{reg}(I^{[k]})\\\\ge (d-1)\\\\mathrm{aim}(\\\\mathcal{H}_I,k)+k$, whenever\\n$I^{[k]}$ is non-zero. Even for the edge ideal $I(G)$ of a graph $G$, it turns\\nout that $\\\\mathrm{aim}(G,k)+k$ is the first general lower bound for the\\nregularity of $I(G)^{[k]}$. In fact, when $G$ is a forest, $\\\\mathrm{aim}(G,k)$\\ncoincides with the $k$-admissible matching number introduced by Erey and Hibi.\\nNext, we show that if $G$ is a block graph, then $\\\\mathrm{reg}(I(G)^{[k]})=\\n\\\\mathrm{aim}(G,k)+k$, and this result can be seen as a generalization of the\\ncorresponding regularity formula for forests. Additionally, for a\\nCohen-Macaulay chordal graph $G$, we prove that $\\\\mathrm{reg}(I(G)^{[2]})=\\n\\\\mathrm{aim}(G,2)+2$. Finally, we propose a conjecture on the regularity of\\nsquare-free powers of edge ideals of chordal graphs.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AC\", \"categories\": \"math.AC,math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T10:19:12Z\"}"}
