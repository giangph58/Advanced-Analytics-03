{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16755v1\", \"title\": \"QAOA-PCA: Enhancing Efficiency in the Quantum Approximate Optimization\\n  Algorithm via Principal Component Analysis\", \"summary\": \"The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a promising\\nvariational algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems on\\nnear-term devices. However, as the number of layers in a QAOA circuit\\nincreases, which is correlated with the quality of the solution, the number of\\nparameters to optimize grows linearly. This results in more iterations required\\nby the classical optimizer, which results in an increasing computational burden\\nas more circuit executions are needed. To mitigate this issue, we introduce\\nQAOA-PCA, a novel reparameterization technique that employs Principal Component\\nAnalysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the QAOA parameter space. By\\nextracting principal components from optimized parameters of smaller problem\\ninstances, QAOA-PCA facilitates efficient optimization with fewer parameters on\\nlarger instances. Our empirical evaluation on the prominent MaxCut problem\\ndemonstrates that QAOA-PCA consistently requires fewer iterations than standard\\nQAOA, achieving substantial efficiency gains. While this comes at the cost of a\\nslight reduction in approximation ratio compared to QAOA with the same number\\nof layers, QAOA-PCA almost always outperforms standard QAOA when matched by\\nparameter count. QAOA-PCA strikes a favorable balance between efficiency and\\nperformance, reducing optimization overhead without significantly compromising\\nsolution quality.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.ET\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T14:27:31Z\"}"}
