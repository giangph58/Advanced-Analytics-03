In this work,\\nconsidering the effective interactions of ALPs with the SM gauge bosons and a\\nfermion dark matter (DM), we explore the DM relic satisfied parameter space and\\nassess its testability through indirect searches. The potential of probing such\\nALP-portal fermionic DM at electron-positron colliders is investigated with the\\nmono-photon + missing energy final states. We show that a spectacular\\ndistinction between the signal and SM background is possible via missing energy\\nvariable, the seed of which lies in the ALP-photon interaction, which also\\ngoverns the relic density of DM. We further discuss the sensitivity of\\nALP-photon coupling using the $\\\\chi^2$ analysis at the future electron-positron\\ncollider specifications.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T12:11:03Z\"}"}
