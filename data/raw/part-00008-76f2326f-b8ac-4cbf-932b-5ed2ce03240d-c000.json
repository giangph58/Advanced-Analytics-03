In this\\nstudy, we developed a method to estimate surface tension from time-series data.\\nWe obtained the curvature-velocity relationship from time-series of binarized\\ncell shape images, and the effective surface tension term was calculated from\\nlinear regression.\\n  During the process, we observed an S-shaped pattern in the curvature-velocity\\nrelationship. To understand the dynamics, we constructed a minimal lattice\\nmodel describing single-cell motion. The model consists of surface tension and\\nprotrusion formation, and the characteristic parameters are obtained from\\nexperimental observations. We found that similar patterns emerged in the\\ncurvature-velocity relationship.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.CB\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.CB\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T06:30:29Z\"}"}
