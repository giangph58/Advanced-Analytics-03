{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16590v1\", \"title\": \"Testing the Gallium anomaly using Electron-Neutrino Scattering\", \"summary\": \"The Gallium anomaly is an unexplained deficit in the neutrinos observed\\nduring the calibration of GALLEX and SAGE using a $^{51}$Cr radioactive source\\nand recently confirmed by BEST. The possible explanations for this deficit\\ninclude an overestimation of the neutrino absorption cross section in Ga, an\\nincorrect measurement of the source activity or the existence of sterile\\nneutrinos. However, as this deficit has only been observed in Ga detectors, it\\nhas not been possible to distinguish among various proposals. Therefore, we\\npropose an experiment using the same radioactive source but with a different\\ndetection method, electron-neutrino scattering. We discuss potential locations\\nfor such an experiment, estimating the main backgrounds and expected event\\nrates, considering various target masses and source positions. Even if the\\nanomaly does not result from the detection method, such an experiment can\\nprovide an independent determination of the branching ratio of the $^{51}$Cr\\ndecay by using the spectral information or observing the scattering angle. It\\nis also sensitive to an eventual baseline dependence of the anomaly, as is\\npredicted in sterile neutrino models.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T10:14:32Z\"}"}
