{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15950v1\", \"title\": \"Detector of microwave photon pairs based on a Josephson photomultiplier\", \"summary\": \"We propose a viable design of a microwave two-photon threshold detector. In\\nessence, the considered scheme is an extension of the existing single-photon\\ndetector - a Josephson photomultiplier (JPM) - an absorbing microwave detector\\nbased on a capacitively-shunted rf SQUID. To implement a two-photon threshold\\ndetector, we utilize a dimer of resonators - two lumped-element resonators\\ninteracting via an asymmetric dc SQUID, with one of the resonators capacitively\\ncoupled to the JPM. By specific tuning of the resonator frequencies and the\\nexternal flux through the dc SQUID coupler, we engineer a non-perturbative\\ntwo-photon coupling between the resonators. This coupling results in the\\ncoherent conversion of a photon pair from one resonator into a single photon in\\nanother resonator, enabling selective response to quantum states with at least\\ntwo photons. We also consider an extended coupler design that allows on-demand\\n\\\\textit{in situ} switching of two-photon coupling. In addition, we propose the\\nmodified JPM design to improve its performance. Our calculations demonstrate\\nthat, for realistic circuit parameters, we can achieve more than $99\\\\%$\\nfidelity of photon pair detection in less than 50 ns. The considered scheme may\\nserve as a building block for the implementation of efficient\\nphoton-number-resolving detectors in circuit QED architecture.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T14:47:20Z\"}"}
