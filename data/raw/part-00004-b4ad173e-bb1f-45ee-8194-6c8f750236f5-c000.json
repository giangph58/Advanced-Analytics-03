{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07830v1\", \"title\": \"MOSAIC: Modeling Social AI for Content Dissemination and Regulation in\\n  Multi-Agent Simulations\", \"summary\": \"We present a novel, open-source social network simulation framework, MOSAIC,\\nwhere generative language agents predict user behaviors such as liking,\\nsharing, and flagging content. This simulation combines LLM agents with a\\ndirected social graph to analyze emergent deception behaviors and gain a better\\nunderstanding of how users determine the veracity of online social content. By\\nconstructing user representations from diverse fine-grained personas, our\\nsystem enables multi-agent simulations that model content dissemination and\\nengagement dynamics at scale. Within this framework, we evaluate three\\ndifferent content moderation strategies with simulated misinformation\\ndissemination, and we find that they not only mitigate the spread of\\nnon-factual content but also increase user engagement. In addition, we analyze\\nthe trajectories of popular content in our simulations, and explore whether\\nsimulation agents' articulated reasoning for their social interactions truly\\naligns with their collective engagement patterns. We open-source our simulation\\nsoftware to encourage further research within AI and social sciences.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI,cs.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:06:54Z\"}"}
