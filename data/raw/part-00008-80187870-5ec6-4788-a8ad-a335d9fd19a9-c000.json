This modification of the boundary condition requires a modification\\nof magnetic helicity, whose suitable replacement is called relative magnetic\\nhelicity. In this work, we investigate rigorously the behaviour of relative\\nmagnetic helicity under turbulent relaxation. In particular, we specify the\\nnormal component of the magnetic field on the boundary and consider the\\n\\\\emph{ideal limit} of resistivity tending to zero in order to model the\\nturbulent evolution in the sense of Onsager's theory of turbulence. We show\\nthat relative magnetic helicity is conserved in this distinguished limit and\\nthat, for constant viscosity, the magnetic field can relax asymptotically to a\\nmagnetohydrostatic equilibrium.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph,math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T13:34:24Z\"}"}
