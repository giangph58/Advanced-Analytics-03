{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20568v1\", \"title\": \"Digital Shielding for Cross-Domain Wi-Fi Signal Adaptation using\\n  Relativistic Average Generative Adversarial Network\", \"summary\": \"Wi-Fi sensing uses radio-frequency signals from Wi-Fi devices to analyze\\nenvironments, enabling tasks such as tracking people, detecting intrusions, and\\nrecognizing gestures. The rise of this technology is driven by the IEEE\\n802.11bf standard and growing demand for tools that can ensure privacy and\\noperate through obstacles. However, the performance of Wi-Fi sensing is heavily\\ninfluenced by environmental conditions, especially when extracting spatial and\\ntemporal features from the surrounding scene. A key challenge is achieving\\nrobust generalization across domains, ensuring stable performance even when the\\nsensing environment changes significantly. This paper introduces a novel deep\\nlearning model for cross-domain adaptation of Wi-Fi signals, inspired by\\nphysical signal shielding. The model uses a Relativistic average Generative\\nAdversarial Network (RaGAN) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM)\\narchitectures for both the generator and discriminator. To simulate physical\\nshielding, an acrylic box lined with electromagnetic shielding fabric was\\nconstructed, mimicking a Faraday cage. Wi-Fi signal spectra were collected from\\nvarious materials both inside (domain-free) and outside (domain-dependent) the\\nbox to train the model. A multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) was trained\\non domain-free spectra and tested on signals denoised by the RaGAN. The system\\nachieved 96% accuracy and demonstrated strong material discrimination\\ncapabilities, offering potential for use in security applications to identify\\nconcealed objects based on their composition.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T09:18:02Z\"}"}
