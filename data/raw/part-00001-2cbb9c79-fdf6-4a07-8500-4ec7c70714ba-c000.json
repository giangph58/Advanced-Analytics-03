{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17380v1\", \"title\": \"NMR chemical shielding for solid-state systems using spin-orbit coupled\\n  ZORA GIPAW\", \"summary\": \"We present an implementation of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) for the computation\\nof nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shielding tensors within linear\\nresponse theory. Our implementation in the Vienna {\\\\it Ab initio} Simulation\\nPackage (VASP) is tailored to solid-state systems by employing periodic\\nboundary conditions and the gauge-including projector augmented waves (GIPAW)\\napproach. Relativistic effects are included on the level of the zeroth-order\\nregular approximation (ZORA). We discuss the challenges posed by the PAW\\npartial wave basis in describing SOC regarding chemical shielding tensors. Our\\nmethod is in good agreement with existing local-basis ZORA implementations for\\na series of Sn, Hg, and Pb molecules and cluster approximations for crystalline\\nsystems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T08:55:30Z\"}"}
