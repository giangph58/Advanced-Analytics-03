Using the\\nfunctional approach and local momentum representation, the coefficient of the\\nderivative term is calculated up to the first order in curvature in the\\none-scalar theory. The two-scalar problem is solved by extracting normal modes\\nand consequent reduction to the single-scalar case. The method can be applied\\nto a larger number of scalars. In the theory with strong hierarchy of masses,\\nthe renormalized effective potential and the coefficients of the second-order\\nderivative terms demonstrate the quantum decoupling in the low-energy limit.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T03:48:03Z\"}"}
