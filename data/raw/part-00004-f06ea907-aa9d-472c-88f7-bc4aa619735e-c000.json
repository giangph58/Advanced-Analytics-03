{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16712v1\", \"title\": \"Detecting Cosmological Phase Transitions with Taiji: Sensitivity\\n  Analysis and Parameter Estimation\", \"summary\": \"We investigate the capability of the Taiji space-based gravitational wave\\nobservatory to detect stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds produced by\\nfirst-order phase transitions in the early universe. Using a comprehensive\\nsimulation framework that incorporates realistic instrumental noise, galactic\\ndouble white dwarf confusion noise, and extragalactic compact binary\\nbackgrounds, we systematically analyze Taiji's sensitivity across a range of\\nsignal parameters. Our Bayesian analysis demonstrates that Taiji can robustly\\ndetect and characterize phase transition signals with energy densities\\nexceeding $\\\\Omega_{\\\\text{PT}} \\\\gtrsim 1.4 \\\\times 10^{-11}$ across most of its\\nfrequency band, with particularly strong sensitivity around $10^{-3}$ to\\n$10^{-2}$ Hz. For signals with amplitudes above $\\\\Omega_{\\\\text{PT}} \\\\gtrsim 1.1\\n\\\\times 10^{-10}$, Taiji can determine the peak frequency with relative\\nprecision better than $10\\\\%$. These detection capabilities would enable Taiji\\nto probe electroweak-scale phase transitions in various beyond-Standard-Model\\nscenarios, potentially revealing new physics connected to baryogenesis and dark\\nmatter production. We quantify detection confidence using both Bayes factors\\nand the Deviance Information Criterion, finding consistent results that\\nvalidate our statistical methodology.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T13:41:54Z\"}"}
