Besides, it can also be applied in many real-world applications,\\nsuch as search engines or retrieval-augmented generation. In response to the\\ngrowing demand for research and application in practice, we introduce a unified\\nframework, \\\\textbf{LLM4Ranking}, which enables users to adopt different ranking\\nmethods using open-source or closed-source API-based LLMs. Our framework\\nprovides a simple and extensible interface for document reranking with LLMs, as\\nwell as easy-to-use evaluation and fine-tuning scripts for this task. We\\nconducted experiments based on this framework and evaluated various models and\\nmethods on several widely used datasets, providing reproducibility results on\\nutilizing LLMs for document reranking. Our code is publicly available at\\nhttps://github.com/liuqi6777/llm4ranking.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR,cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T04:08:38Z\"}"}
