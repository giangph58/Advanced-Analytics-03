This study presents\\nan agent-based simulation approach that models user interactions, considering\\npast conversation history, motivation, and resource constraints. Utilizing\\nGerman Twitter data on political discourse, we fine-tune AI models to generate\\nposts and replies, incorporating sentiment analysis, irony detection, and\\noffensiveness classification. The simulation employs a myopic best-response\\nmodel to govern agent behavior, accounting for decision-making based on\\nexpected rewards. Our results highlight the impact of historical context on\\nAI-generated responses and demonstrate how engagement evolves under varying\\nconstraints.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:17:04Z\"}"}
