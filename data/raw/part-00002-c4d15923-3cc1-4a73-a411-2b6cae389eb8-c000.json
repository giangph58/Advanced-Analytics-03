{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16435v1\", \"title\": \"Toward a Principled Workflow for Prevalence Mapping Using Household\\n  Survey Data\", \"summary\": \"Understanding the prevalence of key demographic and health indicators in\\nsmall geographic areas and domains is of global interest, especially in low-\\nand middle-income countries (LMICs), where vital registration data is sparse\\nand household surveys are the primary source of information. Recent advances in\\ncomputation and the increasing availability of spatially detailed datasets have\\nled to much progress in sophisticated statistical modeling of prevalence. As a\\nresult, high-resolution prevalence maps for many indicators are routinely\\nproduced in the literature. However, statistical and practical guidance for\\nproducing prevalence maps in LMICs has been largely lacking. In particular,\\nadvice in choosing and evaluating models and interpreting results is needed,\\nespecially when data is limited. Software and analysis tools are also usually\\ninaccessible to researchers in low-resource settings to conduct their own\\nanalysis or reproduce findings in the literature. In this paper, we propose a\\ngeneral workflow for prevalence mapping using household survey data. We\\nconsider all stages of the analysis pipeline, with particular emphasis on model\\nchoice and interpretation. We illustrate the proposed workflow using a case\\nstudy mapping the proportion of pregnant women who had at least four antenatal\\ncare visits in Kenya. Reproducible code is provided in the Supplementary\\nMaterials and can be readily extended to a broad collection of indicators.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T05:37:31Z\"}"}
