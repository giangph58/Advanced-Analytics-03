However, existing methods face significant\\nchallenges due to data distributional shifts across different domains, which\\nare exacerbated by the non-stationarity of time series over time. Existing\\nmodels fail to generalize under multiple heterogeneous source domains and\\nemerging unseen new target domains. To fill the research gap, we introduce\\nCICADA (Cross-domain Interpretable Coding for Anomaly Detection and\\nAdaptation), with four key innovations: (1) a mixture of experts (MOE)\\nframework that captures domain-agnostic anomaly features with high flexibility\\nand interpretability; (2) a novel selective meta-learning mechanism to prevent\\nnegative transfer between dissimilar domains, (3) an adaptive expansion\\nalgorithm for emerging heterogeneous domain expansion, and (4) a hierarchical\\nattention structure that quantifies expert contributions during fusion to\\nenhance interpretability further.Extensive experiments on synthetic and\\nreal-world industrial datasets demonstrate that CICADA outperforms\\nstate-of-the-art methods in both cross-domain detection performance and\\ninterpretability.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T09:26:40Z\"}"}
