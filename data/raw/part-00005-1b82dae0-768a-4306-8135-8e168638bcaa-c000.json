{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05178v1\", \"title\": \"Extended Tsallis-Cirto entropy for black and white holes\", \"summary\": \"In reference [1] we considered the black hole thermodynamics with the\\nnon-extensive entropy. This entropy obeys the composition rule which coincides\\nwith the composition rule in the non-extensive Tsallis-Cirto $\\\\delta=2$\\nstatistics. Here we extend this approach to the thermodynamics of white holes.\\nThe entropy of the white hole is negative as follows from the rate of\\nmacroscopic quantum tunneling from black hole to white hole. The white hole\\nentropy is with the minus sign the entropy of the black hole with the same\\nmass, $S_{\\\\rm WH}(M)=-S_{\\\\rm BH}(M)$. This reflects the anti-symmetry with\\nrespect to time reversal, at which the shift vector in the\\nArnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism changes sign. This symmetry allows one to\\nextend the Tsallis-Chirto entropy by adding a minus sign to the Tsallis-Chirto\\nformula applied to white hole. As a result, the composition rule remains the\\nsame, with the only difference being that instead of entropy it contains the\\nentropy modulus. The same non-extensive composition rule is obtained for the\\nentropy of the Reissner-Nordstr\\\\\\\"om black hole. This entropy is formed by the\\npositive entropy of the outer horizon and the negative entropy of the inner\\nhorizon. The model of the black hole formed by \\\"black hole atoms\\\" with\\nPlanck-scale mass is also extended to include the negative entropy of white\\nholes.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,cond-mat.other\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T12:28:21Z\"}"}
