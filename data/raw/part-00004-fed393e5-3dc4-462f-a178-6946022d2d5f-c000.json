To address these challenges, we\\npresent LangPert, a language-based framework designed to detect and mitigate\\nTLP situations in tabletop rearrangement tasks. LangPert integrates a Visual\\nLanguage Model (VLM) to comprehensively monitor policy's skill execution and\\nenvironmental TLP, while leveraging the Hierarchical Chain-of-Thought (HCoT)\\nreasoning mechanism to enhance the Large Language Model (LLM)'s contextual\\nunderstanding and generate adaptive, corrective skill-execution plans. Our\\nexperimental results demonstrate that LangPert handles diverse TLP situations\\nmore effectively than baseline methods, achieving higher task completion rates,\\nimproved execution efficiency, and potential generalization to unseen\\nscenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T05:39:15Z\"}"}
