We show that whenever $\\\\gamma$ and\\n$\\\\eta$ are curves of finite Loewner energy $I^L$, the energy of the composition\\nsatisfies $$I^L(\\\\gamma \\\\circ \\\\eta) \\\\lesssim_K I^L(\\\\gamma) + I^L(\\\\eta),$$ with\\nan explicit constant in terms of the quasiconformal $K$ of $\\\\gamma$ and $\\\\eta$.\\nWe also study the asymptotic growth rate of the Loewner energy under $n$\\nself-compositions $\\\\gamma^n := \\\\gamma \\\\circ \\\\cdots \\\\circ \\\\gamma$, showing\\n$$\\\\limsup_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\log I^L(\\\\gamma^n) \\\\lesssim_K 1,$$\\nagain with explicit constant.\\n  Our approach is to define a new conformally-covariant rooted welding\\nfunctional $W_h(y)$, and show $W_h(y) \\\\asymp_K I^L(\\\\gamma)$ when $h$ is a\\nwelding of $\\\\gamma$ and $y$ is any root (a point in the domain of $h$). In the\\ncourse of our arguments we also give several new expressions for the Loewner\\nenergy, including generalized formulas in terms of the Riemann maps $f$ and $g$\\nfor $\\\\gamma$ which hold irrespective of the placement of $\\\\gamma$ on the\\nRiemann sphere, the normalization of $f$ and $g$, and what disks $D,\\n\\\\overline{D}^c \\\\subset \\\\hat{\\\\mathbb{C}}$ serve as domains. An additional\\ncorollary is that $I^L(\\\\gamma)$ is bounded above by a constant only depending\\non the Weil--Petersson distance from $\\\\gamma$ to the circle.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CV\", \"categories\": \"math.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:28:25Z\"}"}
