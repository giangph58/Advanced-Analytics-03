This mechanism is developed within the\\nSemantic Manifold framework, where belief states are dynamic, structured\\nensembles of natural language fragments. Belief filters act as content-aware\\noperations on these fragments across various cognitive transitions. This paper\\nillustrates how the inherent interpretability and modularity of such a\\nlinguistically-grounded cognitive architecture directly enable belief\\nfiltering, offering a principled approach to agent regulation. The study\\nhighlights the potential for enhancing AI safety and alignment through\\nstructured interventions in an agent's internal semantic space and points to\\nnew directions for architecturally embedded cognitive governance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T03:52:43Z\"}"}
