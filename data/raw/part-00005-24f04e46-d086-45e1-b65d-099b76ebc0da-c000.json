Specifically, for $\\\\alpha$ in\\n$\\\\mathrm{K}^{\\\\mathrm{M}}_{n+1}(k)/2$ we construct an invertible\\n$\\\\mathrm{K}(n)$-motive $L_\\\\alpha$ in a way that is natural in the base field\\nand additive in $\\\\alpha$. This can be seen as categorification of\\n$\\\\mathrm{K}^{\\\\mathrm{M}}_{n+1}(k)/2$ in motives.\\n  The motives $L_\\\\alpha$ are constructed as direct summands of the\\n$\\\\mathrm{K}(n)$-motives of quadrics, and we develop the necessary framework for\\nthe study of the latter. We show that passing to the field of functions of\\nquadrics of dimension greater than or equal to $2^{n+1}-1$ does not lose any\\ninformation about the structure of $\\\\mathrm{K}(n)$-motives. This is based on\\nthe study of \\\"decomposition of the diagonal\\\" in Morava K-theory of quadrics.\\n  For quadrics of dimension less than $2^{n+1}-1$, we show that their Chow\\nmotives can be \\\"reconstructed\\\" from their $\\\\mathrm{K}(n)$-motives, although the\\nlatter appear structurally simpler. Our proof of this result relies on the use\\nof the unstable symmetric operations of Vishik on algebraic cobordism.\\n  The occurrence of the motive $L_\\\\alpha$ as a direct summand of the\\n$\\\\mathrm{K}(n)$-motive of $X$ can be seen as evidence that $\\\\alpha$ is a\\ncohomological invariant of $X$. We study this occurrence for quadrics and\\nrelate it to Kahn's Descent conjecture.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG,math.KT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:52:46Z\"}"}
