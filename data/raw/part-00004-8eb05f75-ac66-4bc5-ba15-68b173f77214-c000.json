Given a problem\\ninstance, the goal is to find $k$ solutions that maximize a specified diversity\\nmeasure; the sum of pairwise Hamming distances or the size of the union of the\\n$k$ solutions. Our framework applies to problems satisfying two structural\\nproperties: (i) All solutions are of equal size and (ii) the family of all\\nsolutions can be represented by a surjection from the family of ideals of some\\nfinite poset. Under these conditions, we show that the problem of computing $k$\\ndiverse solutions can be reduced to the minimum cost flow problem and the\\nmaximum $s$-$t$ flow problem. As applications, we demonstrate that both the\\nunweighted minimum $s$-$t$ cut problem and the stable matching problem satisfy\\nthe requirements of our framework. By utilizing the recent advances in network\\nflows algorithms, we improve the previously known time complexities of the\\ndiverse problems, which were based on submodular function minimization.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS,cs.CC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:06:21Z\"}"}
