While\\ntraditionally the focus has been on building these devices in materials with\\nlarge Pockels coefficient (mainly ferroelectric insulators like lithium\\nniobate), there is a need to engineer EOMs in a semiconductor platform with a\\nview towards device stability (in radiation-hard environments),\\nmanufacturability (wafer size and foundry compatibility) and integration (with\\nactive electronics and quantum confined structures). Here, we demonstrate true\\npush-pull EOMs in a suspended GaAs photonic integrated circuit (PIC) platform\\nby exploiting the orientation induced asymmetry of the Pockels $r_{41}$\\ncoefficient, and folding the two arms of a cm-scale Mach-Zehnder interferometer\\n(MZI) modulator along two orthogonal crystal axes. Our work also shows the\\npotential of incorporating ideas from micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS)\\nin integrated photonics by demonstrating high-performance active devices built\\naround cm-scale suspended waveguides with sub-${\\\\mu}$m optical mode\\nconfinement.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T09:14:55Z\"}"}
