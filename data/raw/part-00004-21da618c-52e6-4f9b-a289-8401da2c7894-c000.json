By employing the energy method, we prove that these solutions\\nexhibit local asymptotic stability when specific parametric criteria are\\nsatisfied. The analysis establishes a direct connection between the stability\\nthresholds and the system's diffusion coefficient, offering quantitative\\ninsights into the mechanisms governing pattern formation. These results provide\\nfoundational theoretical advances for understanding self organization in\\nchemotaxis-driven biological systems, particularly vasculogenesis.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T15:18:02Z\"}"}
