{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20033v1\", \"title\": \"Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in the Incremental Learning of\\n  Medical Images\", \"summary\": \"This paper proposes an Incremental Learning (IL) approach to enhance the\\naccuracy and efficiency of deep learning models in analyzing T2-weighted (T2w)\\nMRI medical images prostate cancer detection using the PI-CAI dataset. We used\\nmultiple health centers' artificial intelligence and radiology data, focused on\\ndifferent tasks that looked at prostate cancer detection using MRI (PI-CAI). We\\nutilized Knowledge Distillation (KD), as it employs generated images from past\\ntasks to guide the training of models for subsequent tasks. The approach\\nyielded improved performance and faster convergence of the models. To\\ndemonstrate the versatility and robustness of our approach, we evaluated it on\\nthe PI-CAI dataset, a diverse set of medical imaging modalities including OCT\\nand PathMNIST, and the benchmark continual learning dataset CIFAR-10. Our\\nresults indicate that KD can be a promising technique for IL in medical image\\nanalysis in which data is sourced from individual health centers and the\\nstorage of large datasets is not feasible. By using generated images from prior\\ntasks, our method enables the model to retain and apply previously acquired\\nknowledge without direct access to the original data.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:56:04Z\"}"}
