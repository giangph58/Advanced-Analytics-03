Therefore, software modernization is\\nessential, particularly data migration between different database schemas.\\nEstablished methodologies, like model transformation and ETL tools, facilitate\\nthis migration; they require deep knowledge of database languages and both the\\nsource and target schemas. This necessity renders data migration an error-prone\\nand cognitively demanding task. Our objective is to alleviate developers'\\nworkloads during schema evolution through our DAMI-Framework. This framework\\nincorporates a domain-specific language (DSL) and a parser to facilitate data\\nmigration between database schemas. DAMI-DSL simplifies schema mapping while\\nthe parser automates SQL script generation. We assess developer experience in\\ndata migration by conducting an empirical evaluation with 21 developers to\\nassess their experiences using our DSL versus traditional SQL. The study allows\\nus to measure their perceptions of the DSL properties and user experience. The\\nparticipants praised DAMI-DSL for its readability and ease of use. The findings\\nindicate that our DSL reduces data migration efforts compared to SQL scripts.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE,cs.DB\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:30:28Z\"}"}
