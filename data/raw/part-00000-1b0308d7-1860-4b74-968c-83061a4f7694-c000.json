We find\\nthat the special form of the scalar potential limits the inflationary Hubble\\nparameter to values $\\\\lesssim 10^{10}\\\\, \\\\textrm{GeV}$ and the inflaton mass to\\n$\\\\lesssim 10^{11} \\\\, \\\\textrm{GeV}$. We obtain analytic results for small field\\ncases and present numerical results for large field ones. We find the\\ntensor-to-scalar ratio $r<10^{-8}$ is always suppressed in these models, while\\nthe running of spectral index $\\\\alpha\\\\approx \\\\mathcal{O}(-10^{-3})$ may be\\ntestable in next-generation CMB experiments. We also discuss the possible\\neffects of SUSY breaking Polonyi term presented in the superpotential where we\\nfind a general upper bound for the SUSY breaking scale for a given value of the\\nHubble parameter.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:08:14Z\"}"}
