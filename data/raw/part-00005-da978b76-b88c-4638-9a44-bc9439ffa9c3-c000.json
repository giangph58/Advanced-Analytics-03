The phthalocyanine (2H-Pc) molecule and its\\npyrrolichydrogen-abstracted derivative (Pc) exhibit vastly different behavior.\\nAndreev reflection across the 2H-Pc contact exhibits a temporary enhancement\\nthat diminishes with increasing conductance. The hybridization of 2H-Pc with\\nthe tip at contact formation gives rise to a Kondo-screened molecular magnetic\\nmoment. In contrast, the single-Pc junction lacks Andreev reflection in the\\nsame conductance range. Spectroscopies and supporting nonequilibrium Green\\nfunction calculations highlight the importance of a molecular orbital close to\\nthe Fermi energy for Andreev reflection.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:40:55Z\"}"}
