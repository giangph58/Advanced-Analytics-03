We get a morphism between $\\\\pi_1^\\\\text{Morse}(f_1,\\\\ast_1)$ and\\n$\\\\pi_1^\\\\text{Morse}(f_2,\\\\ast_2)$ and show that it is functorial. We also define\\nthe morphism in the case of Morse data over different manifolds, thanks to the\\nuse of grafted trajectories. Finally, given an interpolation function on\\n$M\\\\times\\\\mathbb{R}$ between two Morse functions (used for example to define the\\ncontinuation map), we study the Morse fundamental group associated to that\\nfunction and show that it is isomorphic to a relative fundamental group on\\n$M\\\\times\\\\mathbb{R}$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GT\", \"categories\": \"math.GT,math.DG,math.SG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:15:53Z\"}"}
