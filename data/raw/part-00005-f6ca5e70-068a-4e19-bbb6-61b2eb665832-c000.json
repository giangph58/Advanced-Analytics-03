Popular methods\\nfor covariate adjustment include analysis of covariance for continuous\\nendpoints and standardized logistic regression for binary endpoints. For\\nsurvival endpoints, while some covariate adjustment methods have been developed\\nfor specific effect measures, they are not commonly used in practice for\\nvarious reasons, including high demands for theoretical and methodological\\nsophistication as well as computational skills. This article describes an\\naugmentation approach to covariate adjustment for survival endpoints that is\\nrelatively easy to understand and widely applicable to different effect\\nmeasures. This approach involves augmenting a given treatment effect estimator\\nin a way that preserves interpretation, consistency, and asymptotic normality.\\nThe optimal augmentation term, which minimizes asymptotic variance, can be\\nestimated using various statistical and machine learning methods. Simulation\\nresults demonstrate that the augmentation approach can bring substantial gains\\nin statistical efficiency. This approach has been implemented in an R package\\nnamed \\\\texttt{sleete}, which is described in detail and illustrated with real\\ndata.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:28:25Z\"}"}
