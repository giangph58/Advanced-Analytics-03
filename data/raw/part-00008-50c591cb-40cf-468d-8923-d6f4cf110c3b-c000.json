Using the\\ndistributions of minimum pair distances and nearest-neighbor distances, we find\\nthat when the stealthiness parameter $\\\\chi$ is lower than 0.5, the maximal\\nvalues of $\\\\phi$, denoted by $\\\\phi_{\\\\max}$, decrease to zero on average as the\\nparticle number $N$ increases if there are no soft-core repulsions. By\\ncontrast, the inclusion of soft-core repulsions results in very large\\n$\\\\phi_{\\\\max}$ independent of $N$, reaching up to $\\\\phi_{\\\\max}=1.0, 0.86, 0.63$\\nin the zero-$\\\\chi$ limit and decreasing to $\\\\phi_{\\\\max}=1.0, 0.67, 0.47$ at\\n$\\\\chi=0.45$ for $d=1,2,3$, respectively. We obtain explicit formulas for\\n$\\\\phi_{\\\\max}$ as functions of $\\\\chi$ and $N$ for a given $d$. For $d=2,3$, our\\nsoft-core SHU packings for small $\\\\chi$ become configurationally very close to\\nthe jammed hard-particle packings created by fast compression algorithms, as\\nmeasured by the pair statistics. As $\\\\chi$ increases beyond $0.20$, the\\npackings form fewer contacts and linear polymer-like chains. The resulting\\nstructure factors $S(k)$ and pair correlation functions $g_2(r)$ reveal that\\nsoft-core repulsions significantly alter the short- and intermediate-range\\ncorrelations in the SHU ground states. We also compute the spectral density\\n$\\\\tilde{\\\\chi}_{_V}(k)$, which can be used to estimate various physical\\nproperties (e.g., electromagnetic properties, fluid permeability, and mean\\nsurvival time) of SHU two-phase dispersions. Our results offer a new route for\\ndiscovering novel disordered hyperuniform two-phase materials with\\nunprecedentedly high density.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,cond-mat.dis-nn,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T17:52:54Z\"}"}
