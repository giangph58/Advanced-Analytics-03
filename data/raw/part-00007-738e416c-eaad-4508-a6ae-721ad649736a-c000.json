{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16649v1\", \"title\": \"PP-Tac: Paper Picking Using Tactile Feedback in Dexterous Robotic Hands\", \"summary\": \"Robots are increasingly envisioned as human companions, assisting with\\neveryday tasks that often involve manipulating deformable objects. Although\\nrecent advances in robotic hardware and embodied AI have expanded their\\ncapabilities, current systems still struggle with handling thin, flat, and\\ndeformable objects such as paper and fabric. This limitation arises from the\\nlack of suitable perception techniques for robust state estimation under\\ndiverse object appearances, as well as the absence of planning techniques for\\ngenerating appropriate grasp motions. To bridge these gaps, this paper\\nintroduces PP-Tac, a robotic system for picking up paper-like objects. PP-Tac\\nfeatures a multi-fingered robotic hand with high-resolution omnidirectional\\ntactile sensors \\\\sensorname. This hardware configuration enables real-time slip\\ndetection and online frictional force control that mitigates such slips.\\nFurthermore, grasp motion generation is achieved through a trajectory synthesis\\npipeline, which first constructs a dataset of finger's pinching motions. Based\\non this dataset, a diffusion-based policy is trained to control the hand-arm\\nrobotic system. Experiments demonstrate that PP-Tac can effectively grasp\\npaper-like objects of varying material, thickness, and stiffness, achieving an\\noverall success rate of 87.5\\\\%. To our knowledge, this work is the first\\nattempt to grasp paper-like deformable objects using a tactile dexterous hand.\\nOur project webpage can be found at:\\nhttps://peilin-666.github.io/projects/PP-Tac/\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T12:10:11Z\"}"}
