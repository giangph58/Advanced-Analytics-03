This paper\\nexperimentally evaluates the effectiveness of these community search algorithms\\nw.r.t. cohesiveness in the context of online social networks. Social\\ncommunities are formed and developed under the influence of group cohesion\\ntheory, which has been extensively studied in social psychology. However,\\ncurrent generic methods typically measure cohesiveness using structural or\\nattribute-based approaches and overlook domain-specific concepts such as group\\ncohesion. We introduce five novel psychology-informed cohesiveness measures,\\nbased on the concept of group cohesion from social psychology, and propose a\\nnovel framework called CHASE for evaluating eight representative CS algorithms\\nw.r.t.these measures on online social networks. Our analysis reveals that there\\nis no clear correlation between structural and psychological cohesiveness, and\\nno algorithm effectively identifies psychologically cohesive communities in\\nonline social networks. This study provides new insights that could guide the\\ndevelopment of future community search methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR,cs.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T05:08:29Z\"}"}
