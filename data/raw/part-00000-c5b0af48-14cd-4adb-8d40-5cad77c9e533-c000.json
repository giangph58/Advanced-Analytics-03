{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21684v1\", \"title\": \"Using quantum annealing to generate test cases for cyber-physical\\n  systems\", \"summary\": \"Quantum computing has emerged as a powerful tool to efficiently solve\\ncomputational challenges, particularly in simulation and optimisation. However,\\nhardware limitations prevent quantum computers from achieving the full\\ntheoretical potential. Among the quantum algorithms, quantum annealing is a\\nprime candidate to solve optimisation problems. This makes it a natural\\ncandidate for search-based software testing in the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)\\ndomain, which demands effective test cases due to their safety-critical nature.\\nThis work explores the use of quantum annealing to enhance test case generation\\nfor CPS through a mutation-based approach. We encode test case mutation as a\\nbinary optimisation problem, and use quantum annealing to identify and target\\ncritical regions of the test cases for improvement. Our approach mechanises\\nthis process into an algorithm that uses D-Wave's quantum annealer to find the\\nsolution. As a main contribution, we offer insights into how quantum annealing\\ncan advance software testing methodologies by empirically evaluating the\\ncorrelation between problem size, hardware limitations, and the effectiveness\\nof the results. Moreover, we compare the proposed method against\\nstate-of-the-art classical optimisation algorithms, targeting efficiency (time\\nto generate test cases) and effectiveness (fault detection rates). Results\\nindicate that quantum annealing enables faster test case generation while\\nachieving comparable fault detection performance to state-of-the-art\\nalternatives.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.ET\", \"categories\": \"cs.ET,cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:20:58Z\"}"}
