Recently, the integration of deep learning with representation\\nlearning has demonstrated notable advancements, yielding performance\\nenhancements to a certain degree. However, existing methods suffer from at\\nleast one of the following issues: 1. the original graph structure has noise,\\nand 2. during feature propagation and pooling processes, noise is gradually\\naggregated into the graph-level embeddings through information propagation.\\nConsequently, these two limitations mask clustering-friendly information,\\nleading to suboptimal graph-level clustering performance. To this end, we\\npropose a novel Dual Boost-Driven Graph-Level Clustering Network (DBGCN) to\\nalternately promote graph-level clustering and filtering out interference\\ninformation in a unified framework. Specifically, in the pooling step, we\\nevaluate the contribution of features at the global and optimize them using a\\nlearnable transformation matrix to obtain high-quality graph-level\\nrepresentation, such that the model's reasoning capability can be improved.\\nMoreover, to enable reliable graph-level clustering, we first identify and\\nsuppress information detrimental to clustering by evaluating similarities\\nbetween graph-level representations, providing more accurate guidance for\\nmulti-view fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrated that DBGCN outperforms\\nthe state-of-the-art graph-level clustering methods on six benchmark datasets.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T04:32:46Z\"}"}
