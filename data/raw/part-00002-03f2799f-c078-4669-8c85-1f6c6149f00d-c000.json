This work presents a simulated\\nbifurcation (SB) Ising solver in CMOS for NP-hard optimization problems. Analog\\ndomain computing led to a superior implementation of this algorithm as inherent\\nand injected noise is required in SB Ising solvers. The architecture novelties\\ninclude the use of SRAM compute-in-memory (CIM) to accelerate bifurcation as\\nwell as the generation and injection of optimal decaying noise in the analog\\ndomain. We propose a novel 10-T SRAM cell capable of performing ternary\\nmultiplication. When measured with 60- node, 50% density, random, binary MAXCUT\\ngraphs, this all- to-all connected Ising solver reliably achieves above 93% of\\nthe ground state solution in 0.6us with 10.8mW average power in TSMC 180nm\\nCMOS. Our chip achieves an order of magnitude improvement in time-to-solution\\nand power compared to previously proposed Ising solvers in CMOS and other\\nplatforms.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.CL,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:28:14Z\"}"}
