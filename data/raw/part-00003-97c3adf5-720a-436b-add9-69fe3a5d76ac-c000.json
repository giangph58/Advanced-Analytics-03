{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03512v1\", \"title\": \"Artificial Protozoa Optimizer (APO): A novel bio-inspired metaheuristic\\n  algorithm for engineering optimization\", \"summary\": \"This study proposes a novel artificial protozoa optimizer (APO) that is\\ninspired by protozoa in nature. The APO mimics the survival mechanisms of\\nprotozoa by simulating their foraging, dormancy, and reproductive behaviors.\\nThe APO was mathematically modeled and implemented to perform the optimization\\nprocesses of metaheuristic algorithms. The performance of the APO was verified\\nvia experimental simulations and compared with 32 state-of-the-art algorithms.\\nWilcoxon signed-rank test was performed for pairwise comparisons of the\\nproposed APO with the state-of-the-art algorithms, and Friedman test was used\\nfor multiple comparisons. First, the APO was tested using 12 functions of the\\n2022 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation benchmark. Considering\\npracticality, the proposed APO was used to solve five popular engineering\\ndesign problems in a continuous space with constraints. Moreover, the APO was\\napplied to solve a multilevel image segmentation task in a discrete space with\\nconstraints. The experiments confirmed that the APO could provide highly\\ncompetitive results for optimization problems.
