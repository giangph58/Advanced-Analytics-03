{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02816v1\", \"title\": \"On cycle covers of infinite bipartite graphs\", \"summary\": \"Given a graph $G$ and a subset $X$ of vertices of $G$ with size at least two,\\nwe denote by $N^2_G(X)$ the set of vertices of $G$ that have at least two\\nneighbors in $X$. We say that a bipartite graph $G$ with sides $A$ and $B$\\nsatisfies the double Hall property if for every subset $X$ of vertices of $A$\\nwith size at least 2, $\\\\vert N^2_G(X)\\\\vert \\\\geq \\\\vert X\\\\vert$. Salia\\nconjectured that if $G$ is a bipartite graph that satisfies the double Hall\\nproperty, then there exists a cycle in $G$ that covers all vertices of $A$. In\\nthis work, we study this conjecture restricted to infinite graphs. For this, we\\nuse the definition of ends and infinite cycles. It is simple to see that\\nSalia's conjecture is false for infinite graphs in general. Consequently, all\\nour results are partial. Under certain hypothesis it is possible to obtain a\\ncollection of pairwise disjoint 2-regular subgraphs that covers $A$. We show\\nthat if side $B$ is locally finite and side $A$ is countable, then the\\nconjecture is true. Furthermore, assuming the conjecture holds for finite\\ngraphs, we show that it holds for infinite graphs with a restriction on the\\ndegree of the vertices of $B$. This result is inspired by the result obtained\\nby Bar\\\\'at, Grzesik, Jung, Nagy and P\\\\'alv\\\\\\\"olgyi for finite graphs. Finally,\\nwe also show that if Salia's conjecture holds for some cases of infinite\\ngraphs, then the conjecture about finite graphs presented by Lavrov and\\nVandenbussche is true.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,math.GN\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T17:57:22Z\"}"}
