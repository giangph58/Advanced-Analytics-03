Here,\\nconfinement epitaxy is exploited to realize two-dimensional gallium via\\nintercalation in epitaxial graphene grown on silicon carbide. Novel\\nsuperstructures arising from the interaction of gallenene (a monolayer of\\ngallium) with graphene and the silicon carbide substrate are investigated. The\\ncoexistence of different gallenene phases, including b010-gallenene and the\\nelusive high-pressure Ga(III) phase, is identified. This work sheds new light\\non the formation of two-dimensional gallium and provides a platform for\\ninvestigating the exotic electronic and optical properties of confined\\ngallenene.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T08:26:37Z\"}"}
