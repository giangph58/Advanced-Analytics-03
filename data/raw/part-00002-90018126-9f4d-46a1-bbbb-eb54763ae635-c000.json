The Weyl-mediated\\nRuderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction may be related to the magnetic\\norders observed in rare-earth magnetic Weyl semimetals. Previous studies of\\nRKKY interaction between magnetic impurities in Weyl semimetals found\\nHeisenberg, Ising-like, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) types of interactions.\\nHowever, different range functions are obtained in the literature. In this\\nwork, we calculate the Weyl-mediated RKKY interaction by using the\\ndivergence-free imaginary-time formalism and obtain exact analytical results at\\nfinite temperature. The discrepancies among zero temperature range functions in\\nthe literature are resolved. At nonzero temperature, the interaction strength\\ndecays exponentially in the long distance limit. But in the short distance\\nlimit, the DM interaction shows a thermal enhancement, an effect persists up to\\nhigher temperature for shorter distance. This provides a mechanism stabilizing\\nthe helical order observed in rare-earth magnetic Weyl semimetals.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T10:39:59Z\"}"}
