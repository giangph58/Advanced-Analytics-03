For understanding the seismic response, accurate models are key to\\npredict the ground motions, which are generally sensitive to various factors,\\nincluding earthquake source parameters like the focal mechanism, i.e., strike,\\ndip, and rake angles. This study examines how uncertainties in these parameters\\naffect ground motion predictions. The analysis is based on the SMATCH\\nbenchmark, which provides a standardized approach for evaluating the seismic\\nresponse of the Cruas-Meysse NPP in France during the Mw 4.9 Le-Teil earthquake\\nof 2019. A set of 27 3D high-fidelity numerical simulations was performed using\\na spectral-element method, each incorporating different focal mechanism\\nvariations. These simulations provide an effective approach for investigating\\nthe factors behind the exceptional ground motion observed during this event. To\\nquantify uncertainty, the simulated ground motions were compared to recorded\\ndata using two well-established goodness-of-fit criteria: one assessing\\ntime-frequency domain characteristics and another focusing on the\\ncharacterization of the ground motion signals by intensity measures. Results\\nhighlight the significant influence of focal mechanism variability on ground\\nmotion predictions, especially on the rake angle, which showed the strongest\\ncorrelation with wave and intensity measures.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CE\", \"categories\": \"cs.CE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T16:22:46Z\"}"}
