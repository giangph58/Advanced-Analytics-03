In\\nantiferromagnets (AFMs), where the fundamental quantum mechanical exchange\\ninteraction governs spin dynamics, this access is especially compelling,\\nenabling the excitation of magnons - collective spin-wave modes - that\\nnaturally reach terahertz (THz) frequencies and supersonic velocities.\\nFemtosecond optical pulses provided a route to coherently excite such magnons\\nacross the entire Brillouin zone. Controlling their spectral properties - such\\nas the magnon gap and dispersion - represents the next monumental step,\\nenabling dynamic tuning of group velocities, coherence, and interaction\\npathways. Yet, achieving this remains a challenge, requiring ultrafast and\\nlong-lasting manipulation of the underlying exchange interaction. Here, we show\\nthat in DyFeO3 - an insulating AFM with strongly coupled electronic and\\nmagnetic degrees of freedom - resonant above-bandgap optical excitation leads\\nto a dramatic renormalization of the THz magnon spectrum, including a\\nnear-total collapse of the magnon gap. Our analysis reveals this transformation\\nto be consistent with a transient reduction of the exchange interaction by\\nnearly 90% in the near-surface nanoscale region. These findings establish a\\npathway for light-driven, nanoscale control of AFM spin dynamics, opening\\nopportunities for reconfigurable, high-speed magnonic and spintronic\\napplications.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T11:24:51Z\"}"}
