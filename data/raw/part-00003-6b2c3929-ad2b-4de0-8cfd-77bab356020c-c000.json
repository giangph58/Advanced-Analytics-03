By\\nusing a new div-curl lemma which was first introduced by the third author to\\nestablish a bilinear estimate, and also the interaction Morawetz estimate, the\\nglobal well-posedness for the skew mean curvature flow in the critical Besov\\nspace is established, and hence the corresponding result obtained by Huang, Li\\nand Tataru (Int. Math. Res. Not. 2024, no. 5, 3748-3798) is substantially\\nimproved.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:08:54Z\"}"}
