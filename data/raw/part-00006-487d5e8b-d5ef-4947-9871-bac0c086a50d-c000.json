We divide into the cases in which the Lie algebra's centre is\\nnon-trivial (and necessarily one-dimensional) and those where it is zero. In\\nthe former case we show that any Sasakian structure on a unimodular Lie algebra\\nis $\\\\eta$-Einstein. As for centreless Sasakian Lie algebras, we devise a\\ncomplete characterisation under certain dimensional assumptions regarding the\\naction of the Reeb vector. Using this result, together with the theory of\\nnormal $j$-algebras and modifications of Hermitian Lie algebras, we construct\\nnew examples of $\\\\eta$-Einstein Sasakian Lie algebras and solvmanifolds, and\\nprovide effective restrictions for their existence.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T16:57:22Z\"}"}
