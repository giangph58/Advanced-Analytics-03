{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15891v1\", \"title\": \"Optimal body force for heat transfer in turbulent vertical heated pipe\\n  flow\", \"summary\": \"As buoyancy can help drive a flow, the vertical heated-pipe arrangement is\\nwidely used in thermal engineering applications. However, buoyancy suppresses\\nand can even laminarise turbulence in the flow, thereby seriously damaging the\\nheat transfer, measured by the Nusselt number Nu. As buoyancy, measured by the\\nparameter C, is increased, three flow regimes are possible: shear-driven\\nturbulence, laminarised flow, and convective turbulence. In Chu et al. (2024)\\nwe employed a variational optimisation method to investigate how the buoyancy\\nchanges the structure of the minimal flow perturbation that triggers\\nturbulence. Here, we extend the method to find an optimal body force of limited\\nmagnitude that maximises heat transfer, and examine how time-dependence of the\\nflow affects the optimisation in each of the three flow regimes. Optimisations\\nare performed at Re = 3000, and the force is found to laminarise convective\\nturbulence, or make it only weakly chaotic for C up to 8. Consistent with\\nprevious computations that assume steady flow, the optimal force induces\\nstreamwise-independent rolls, but at larger amplitude the force triggers\\ntime-dependent turbulent flow. Transition from the laminar\\nstreamwise-independent state to turbulent flow can either enhance Nu or reduce\\nNu. For highly chaotic flows, either shear turbulence at C = 1 or convective\\nturbulence at C = 16, 32, optimisations place rolls closer to the wall than\\ncalculations with the steady flow assumption. At any given force amplitude,\\nhowever, the enhanced Nu is only weakly dependent on the number of induced\\nrolls.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T13:34:40Z\"}"}
