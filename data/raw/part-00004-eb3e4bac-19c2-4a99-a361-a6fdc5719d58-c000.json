This study proposes a zero-inflated extended\\ngeneralized Pareto distribution model that unifies the modeling of dry days,\\nlow, moderate, and extreme rainfall within a single framework. Unlike\\ntraditional approaches that rely on prespecified threshold selection to\\nidentify extremes, our proposed model captures tail behavior intrinsically\\nthrough a tail index that aligns with the generalized Pareto distribution. The\\nmodel also accommodates covariate effects via generalized additive modeling,\\nallowing for the representation of complex climatic variability. The current\\nimplementation is limited to a univariate setting, modeling daily rainfall\\nindependently of covariates. Model estimation is carried out using both maximum\\nlikelihood and Bayesian approaches. Simulation studies and empirical\\napplications demonstrate the model flexibility in capturing zero inflation and\\nheavy-tailed behavior characteristics of daily rainfall distributions.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T10:45:09Z\"}"}
