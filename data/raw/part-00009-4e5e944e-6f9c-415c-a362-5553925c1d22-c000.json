{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16679v1\", \"title\": \"Transition mechanisms in hypersonic wind-tunnel nozzles: a\\n  methodological approach using global linear stability analysis\", \"summary\": \"Base-flow computations and stability analyses are performed for a hypersonic\\nwind tunnel nozzle at a Mach number of 6. Isothermal and adiabatic wall\\nboundary conditions are investigated, and moderate stagnation conditions are\\nused to provide representative scenarios to study the transition in quiet\\nhypersonic wind tunnel facilities. Under these conditions, the studied nozzle\\nshows a small flow separation at the convergent inlet. Global stability\\nanalysis reveals that this recirculation bubble may trigger a classical\\nthree-dimensional stationary unstable global mode. Resolvent analysis reveals\\nG\\\\\\\"ortler, first and second Mack modes affecting the divergent part of the\\nnozzle, along with a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability induced by the bubble. The\\npresent study also highlights the key impact of perturbations located in the\\nconvergent inlet on the development of instabilities further downstream in the\\ndivergent outlet, helping understand the need and efficacy of a suction lip\\nupstream of the nozzle throat to mitigate instabilities in the divergent\\nnozzle. Detailed knowledge of all these mechanisms is essential for\\nunderstanding flows in quiet hypersonic wind tunnel nozzles and, consequently,\\nrepresents a key step toward the optimisation of such nozzles.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T12:56:20Z\"}"}
