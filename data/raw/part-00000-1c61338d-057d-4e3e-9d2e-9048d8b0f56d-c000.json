{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21646v1\", \"title\": \"Diffusion-based Adversarial Identity Manipulation for Facial Privacy\\n  Protection\", \"summary\": \"The success of face recognition (FR) systems has led to serious privacy\\nconcerns due to potential unauthorized surveillance and user tracking on social\\nnetworks. Existing methods for enhancing privacy fail to generate natural face\\nimages that can protect facial privacy. In this paper, we propose\\ndiffusion-based adversarial identity manipulation (DiffAIM) to generate natural\\nand highly transferable adversarial faces against malicious FR systems. To be\\nspecific, we manipulate facial identity within the low-dimensional latent space\\nof a diffusion model. This involves iteratively injecting gradient-based\\nadversarial identity guidance during the reverse diffusion process,\\nprogressively steering the generation toward the desired adversarial faces. The\\nguidance is optimized for identity convergence towards a target while promoting\\nsemantic divergence from the source, facilitating effective impersonation while\\nmaintaining visual naturalness. We further incorporate structure-preserving\\nregularization to preserve facial structure consistency during manipulation.\\nExtensive experiments on both face verification and identification tasks\\ndemonstrate that compared with the state-of-the-art, DiffAIM achieves stronger\\nblack-box attack transferability while maintaining superior visual quality. We\\nalso demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for commercial FR\\nAPIs, including Face++ and Aliyun.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T13:49:59Z\"}"}
