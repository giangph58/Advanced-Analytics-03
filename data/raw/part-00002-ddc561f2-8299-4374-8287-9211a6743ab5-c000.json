Although such a mindset should\\ngenerally apply to systems of any size, its quantum mechanical implications are\\nparticularly intriguing and, for this reason, we examine here a minimal\\nphysical structure where the system and the environment are described,\\nrespectively, by a pair of quantum oscillators coupled by an appropriate\\nHermitian interaction able to amplify the entropy of the initial state. Since\\nat the onset of the dynamical evolution the system is originally in a pure\\nstate, its entropy variation is always positive semidefinite and the Landauer's\\nconjecture should not impose any constraint. Nonetheless, provided the quantum\\namplification is effective, it turns out that the entropy variation of the\\nsystem always undershoots the heat transferred to the environment. When the\\ninitial thermal state of the environment is characterized by a chemical\\npotential, the entropy growth is bounded both by the particles and by the heat\\nflowing to the environment. The limits deduced in the quantum thermodynamical\\nframework are also scrutinized from a field theory standpoint where species of\\ndifferent spins are copiously produced (especially in a cosmological context)\\nthanks to the rapid variation of the space-time curvature.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T06:41:50Z\"}"}
