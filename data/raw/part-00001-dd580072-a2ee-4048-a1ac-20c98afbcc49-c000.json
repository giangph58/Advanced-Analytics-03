In\\nparticular, we establish a sublinear lower bound on the number of eigenvalues\\nin a sufficiently large strip determined by the pressure of the harmonic\\n1-form. Furthermore, following an observation by Anantharaman\\n\\\\cite{nalinideviation}, we show that quantum unique ergodicity fails to hold\\nfor certain twisted Laplacians.\", \"main_category\": \"math.SP\", \"categories\": \"math.SP,math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T05:50:43Z\"}"}
