{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03594v1\", \"title\": \"Artificial Potential Field and Sliding Mode Control for Spacecraft\\n  Attitude Maneuver with Actuation and Pointing Constraints\", \"summary\": \"This study investigates the combination of guidance and control strategies\\nfor rigid spacecraft attitude reorientation, while dealing with forbidden\\npointing constraints, actuator limitations, and system uncertainties. These\\nconstraints arise due to the presence of bright objects in space that may\\ndamage sensitive payloads onboard the spacecraft, and the risk that actuator\\nsaturations may compromise closed-loop system stability. Furthermore,\\nspacecraft attitude dynamics are typically affected by parametric\\nuncertainties, external disturbances, and system nonlinearities, which cannot\\nbe neglected. In this article, the problem of spacecraft reorientation under\\npointing and actuation constraints is addressed using a strategy that combines\\nArtificial Potential Field (APF) and Sliding Mode Control (SMC). A rigorous\\nLyapunov-based analysis yields closed-form expressions for APF/SMC gains,\\nproviding explicit mathematical formulas for gain values without the need for\\niterative computations. These expressions account for angular velocity and\\ncontrol torque limitations, external disturbances, and inertia uncertainties.\\nThe robustness of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated through Monte\\nCarlo simulations using a high-fidelity attitude dynamics simulator.\\nAdditionally, mu-analysis is employed to assess local stability properties and\\nquantify robustness margins. The results confirm the practical feasibility of\\nthe proposed method in real-world space scenarios, highlighting its\\neffectiveness in uncertain and constrained environments.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T14:54:39Z\"}"}
