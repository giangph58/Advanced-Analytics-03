We then use this invariance principle in order to\\nprovide an asymptotic theory for a wide class of non-linear SPDEs. A novel\\ningredient of this invariance principle is the dissipativity of the underlying\\nstochastic PDE.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T11:55:05Z\"}"}
