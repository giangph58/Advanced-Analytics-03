{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07850v1\", \"title\": \"Probabilistic Multi-Criteria Decision-Making for Circularity Performance\\n  of Modern Methods of Construction Products\", \"summary\": \"The construction industry faces increasingly more significant pressure to\\nreduce resource consumption, minimise waste, and enhance environmental\\nperformance. Towards the transition to a circular economy in the construction\\nindustry, one of the challenges is the lack of a standardised assessment\\nframework and methods to measure circularity at the product level. To support a\\nmore sustainable and circular construction industry through robust and enhanced\\nscenario analysis, this paper integrates probabilistic analysis into the\\ncoupled assessment framework; this research addresses uncertainties associated\\nwith multiple criteria and diverse stakeholders in the construction industry to\\nenable more robust decision-making support on both circularity and\\nsustainability performance. By demonstrating the application in three\\nreal-world MMC products, the proposed framework offers a novel approach to\\nsimultaneously assess the circularity and sustainability of MMC products with\\nrobustness and objectiveness.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA,stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:27:34Z\"}"}
