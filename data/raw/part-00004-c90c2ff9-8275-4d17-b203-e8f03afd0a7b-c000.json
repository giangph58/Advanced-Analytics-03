{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11784v1\", \"title\": \"DALC: Distributed Arithmetic Coding Aided by Linear Codes\", \"summary\": \"Distributed Arithmetic Coding (DAC) has emerged as a feasible solution to the\\nSlepian-Wolf problem, particularly in scenarios with non-stationary sources and\\nfor data sequences with lengths ranging from small to medium. Due to the\\ninherent decoding ambiguity in DAC, the number of candidate paths grows\\nexponentially with the increase in source length. To select the correct\\ndecoding path from the set of candidates, DAC decoders utilize the Maximum A\\nPosteriori (MAP) metric to rank the decoding sequences, outputting the path\\nwith the highest MAP metric as the decoding result of the decoder. However,\\nthis method may still inadvertently output incorrect paths that have a MAP\\nmetric higher than the correct decoding path, despite not being the correct\\ndecoding path. To address the issue, we propose Distributed Arithmetic Coding\\nAided by Linear Codes (DALC), which employs linear codes to constrain the\\ndecoding process, thereby eliminating some incorrect paths and preserving the\\ncorrect one. During the encoding phase, DALC generates the parity bits of the\\nlinear code for encoding the source data. In the decoding phase, each path in\\nthe set of candidate paths is verified in descending order according to the MAP\\nmetric until a path that meets the verification criteria is encountered, which\\nis then outputted as the decoding result. DALC enhances the decoding\\nperformance of DAC by excluding candidate paths that do not meet the\\nconstraints imposed by linear codes. Our experimental results demonstrate that\\nDALC reduces the Bit Error Rate(BER), with especially improvements in skewed\\nsource data scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T05:36:52Z\"}"}
