While a number of efficient mechanisms\\nthat Pareto-dominate DA are available, a normative question remains unexplored:\\nwhich students should benefit from efficiency enhancements? We address it by\\nintroducing the concept of \\\\emph{maximally improvable students}, who benefit in\\nevery improvement over DA that includes as many students as possible in\\nset-inclusion terms. We prove that common mechanisms such as\\nEfficiency-Adjusted DA (EADA) and Top Trading Cycles applied to DA (DA+TTC) can\\nfall significantly short of this benchmark. These mechanisms may only improve\\ntwo maximally-improvable students when up to $n-1$ could benefit. Addressing\\nthis limitation, we develop the Maximum Improvement over DA mechanism (MIDA),\\nwhich generates an efficient allocation that maximises the number of students\\nimproved over DA. We show that MIDA can generate fewer blocking pairs than EADA\\nand DA+TTC, demonstrating that its distributional improvements need not come at\\nthe cost of high justified envy.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.TH\", \"categories\": \"econ.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T11:57:41Z\"}"}
