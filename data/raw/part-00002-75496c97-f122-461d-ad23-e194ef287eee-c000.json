{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03656v1\", \"title\": \"Extreme-ultraviolet transient brightenings in the quiet-Sun corona :\\n  Closest-perihelion observations with Solar Orbiter/EUI\", \"summary\": \"The extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) brightenings identified by Solar Orbiter,\\ncommonly known as campfires, are the smallest transient brightenings detected\\nto date outside active regions in the solar corona. We investigate the\\nspatio-temporal distribution of a large ensemble of the finest-scale EUV\\ntransient brightenings observed by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) aboard\\nSolar Orbiter. We perform a statistical analysis of the EUV brightenings by\\nusing quiet-Sun observations at the highest possible spatial resolution ever\\nobtained by EUI. We use observations in the 17.4 nm passband of the High\\nResolution EUV Imager (HRIEUV) of EUI acquired during the closest perihelia of\\nSolar Orbiter in 2022 and 2023. Solar Orbiter being at a distance 0.293 AU from\\nthe Sun, these observations have an exceptionally high image scale of 105 km,\\nrecorded at a fast cadence of 3 seconds. We use a wavelet-based automatic\\ndetection algorithm to detect and characterise the events of interest, and\\nstudy their morphological and photometrical properties. We report the detection\\nof smallest and shortest lived EUV brightenings to date in the quiet-Sun. The\\nsize and lifetime of the detected EUV brightenings appear power-law distributed\\ndown to a size of 0.01 Mm$^{2}$ and a lifetime of 3 seconds. In general their\\nsizes lie in the range of 0.01 Mm$^{2}$ to 50 Mm$^{2}$ , and their lifetimes\\nvary between 3 seconds and 40 minutes. We find an increasingly high number of\\nEUV brightenings at smaller spatial and temporal scales. We estimate that about\\n3600 EUV brightenings appear per second on the whole Sun. The HRIEUV\\nbrightenings thus represent the most prevalent, localised and finest-scale\\ntransient EUV brightenings in the quiet regions of the solar corona.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T16:01:40Z\"}"}
