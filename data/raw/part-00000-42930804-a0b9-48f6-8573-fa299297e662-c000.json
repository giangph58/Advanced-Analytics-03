In this work, we propose Coupled Score Distillation (CSD), a framework\\nthat couples multi-view joint distribution priors to ensure geometrically\\nconsistent 3D generation while enabling the stable and direct optimization of\\n3D Gaussian Splatting. Specifically, by reformulating the optimization as a\\nmulti-view joint optimization problem, we derive an effective optimization rule\\nthat effectively couples multi-view priors to guide optimization across\\ndifferent viewpoints while preserving the diversity of generated 3D assets.\\nAdditionally, we propose a framework that directly optimizes 3D Gaussian\\nSplatting (3D-GS) with random initialization to generate geometrically\\nconsistent 3D content. We further employ a deformable tetrahedral grid,\\ninitialized from 3D-GS and refined through CSD, to produce high-quality,\\nrefined meshes. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate\\nthe efficiency and competitive quality of our approach.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T09:12:45Z\"}"}
