{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12240v1\", \"title\": \"Cobra: Efficient Line Art COlorization with BRoAder References\", \"summary\": \"The comic production industry requires reference-based line art colorization\\nwith high accuracy, efficiency, contextual consistency, and flexible control. A\\ncomic page often involves diverse characters, objects, and backgrounds, which\\ncomplicates the coloring process. Despite advancements in diffusion models for\\nimage generation, their application in line art colorization remains limited,\\nfacing challenges related to handling extensive reference images,\\ntime-consuming inference, and flexible control. We investigate the necessity of\\nextensive contextual image guidance on the quality of line art colorization. To\\naddress these challenges, we introduce Cobra, an efficient and versatile method\\nthat supports color hints and utilizes over 200 reference images while\\nmaintaining low latency. Central to Cobra is a Causal Sparse DiT architecture,\\nwhich leverages specially designed positional encodings, causal sparse\\nattention, and Key-Value Cache to effectively manage long-context references\\nand ensure color identity consistency. Results demonstrate that Cobra achieves\\naccurate line art colorization through extensive contextual reference,\\nsignificantly enhancing inference speed and interactivity, thereby meeting\\ncritical industrial demands. We release our codes and models on our project\\npage: https://zhuang2002.github.io/Cobra/.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T16:45:19Z\"}"}
