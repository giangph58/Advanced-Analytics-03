When\\ncompared with the standard conforming counterpart, the nonconforming FEM can\\nprovide an approximation with fewer degrees of freedom, leading to improved\\ncomputational efficiency. We establish the convergence of the resulting\\nnumerical scheme in the sense that the sequences of phase-field functions and\\ndiscrete velocity fields contain subsequences that converge to a minimizing\\npair of the continuous problem in the $H^1$-norm and a mesh-dependent norm,\\nrespectively. We present extensive numerical results to illustrate the\\nperformance of the approach, including a comparison with the popular\\nTaylor-Hood elements.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T04:29:22Z\"}"}
