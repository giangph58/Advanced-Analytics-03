We used new Rossiter-McLaughlin observations gathered with the Keck\\nPlanet Finder to measure the sky-projected obliquity $\\\\lambda =\\n7$$^\\\\circ$$^{+10^\\\\circ}_{-11^\\\\circ}$. Combined with a stellar rotation period\\nof $23.47\\\\pm0.29$ days measured with photometry from the Tierras Observatory,\\nthis yields a stellar inclination of $90^{\\\\circ} \\\\pm 13^{\\\\circ}$ and a true\\nobliquity $\\\\psi = 15.6$$^\\\\circ$$^{+7.7^\\\\circ}_{-7.3^\\\\circ}$, indicating that\\nthe planet's orbit is well aligned with the rotation axis of its host star. The\\ndetermination of $\\\\psi$ is important for investigating a potential bimodality\\nin the orbits of short-period sub-Saturns around cool stars, which tend to be\\neither aligned with or perpendicular to their host stars' spin axes.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:28:08Z\"}"}
