In this study, we investigate the\\nphenomenology of sub-GeV inelastic dark matter scenarios mediated by a\\nlepton-specific scalar portal. By solving Boltzmann equations, we obtain a\\nthermal target curves for the set of inelastic DM mass splitting in the sub-GeV\\nmediator mass range. We study the discovery potential of lepton fixed-target\\nexperiments, particularly NA64e and NA64$\\\\mu$, through their missing-energy\\nsignatures. Our analysis focuses on the $\\\\phi$-strahlung process, $l N \\\\to l N\\n\\\\phi$, followed by the invisible decay of the scalar mediator into Majorana\\ndark matter particles $\\\\phi \\\\to \\\\chi_1 \\\\chi_2$, as a probe of the mediator\\ncoupling with charged leptons of Standard Model. For the viable parameters of\\nthe inelastic dark matter scenario, we derive the sensitivity projections for\\nNA64e and NA64$\\\\mu$, implying that boosted state $\\\\chi_2$ decays visibly\\n$\\\\chi_2 \\\\to \\\\chi_1 e^+ e^-$ beyond the detector acceptance. Our results\\ndemonstrate the complementary roles of electron- and muon-beam experiments in\\nexploring the sub-GeV inelastic dark matter sector mediated by the scalar\\nportal.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T09:50:45Z\"}"}
