{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06616v1\", \"title\": \"Search for Type IL Gamma-ray Bursts: Criterion, Results, Verification\\n  and Physical Implication\", \"summary\": \"As an interesting subclass of gamma-ray burst (GRB), Type IL GRB (such as GRB\\n211211A and GRB 230307A) features a long-duration prompt emission but\\noriginating from compact binary merger. The \\\"long duration\\\" emisison of Type IL\\nGRB are dominately composed of the main burst, rather than the extended\\nemission, differentiating them from the traditional \\\"long-short\\\" GRB (e.g., GRB\\n060614). Previous study has reported several Type IL GRBs by visual inspection\\nof their light curves. In this work, we established a detailed criterion to\\nidentify Type IL GRBs by light curve, and then systematically searched the\\narchival \\\\textit{Fermi}/GBM data with this criterion, resulting in a sample of\\n5 type IL GRBs from January 1, 2014 to January 1, 2024, i.e. GRB 230307A, GRB\\n211211A, GRB 200914A, GRB 200311A and GRB 170228A. Apart from the light curve\\npattern, we find that the temporal and spectral properties of these 5 GRBs also\\nsupport this classification. Interestingly, we find that the energy ratio\\nbetween extended emission and main emission is almost constant ($\\\\sim0.7$, with\\nsmall scattering) for these GRBs, which have strong implication on the\\nmechanism of Type IL burst. We discuss theoretical models to interpret the\\nprogenitor, central engine, and extended emission of these Type IL bursts.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T06:24:50Z\"}"}
