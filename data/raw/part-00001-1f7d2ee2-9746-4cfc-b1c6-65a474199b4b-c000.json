In our experiments, the qubit is\\ncoupled to an open coplanar waveguide such that the transmission of microwaves\\nthrough this line depends on the qubit's state. To determine the occupation of\\nthe first excited qubit energy level, we introduced a two-pulse technique. The\\nfirst applied pulse, at a frequency close to the eigenfrequency of the qubit,\\nserves to excite the qubit. A second pulse is then used for probing the\\ntransition between the first and second excited energy levels. Utilizing this\\nmeasurement technique allowed for the reconstruction of the relaxation dynamics\\nand Rabi oscillations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the consistency between the\\nextracted parameters and the corresponding estimations from frequency-domain\\nmeasurements.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T09:52:54Z\"}"}
