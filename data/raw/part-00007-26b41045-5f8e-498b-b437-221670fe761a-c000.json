The NNT was\\noriginally defined as the average number of patients needed to be treated to\\nobserve one less adverse effect. In this study, we introduce the novel direct\\nand indirect number needed to treat (DNNT and INNT, respectively). The DNNT and\\nthe INNT are efficacy measures defined as the average number of patients that\\nneeded to be treated to benefit from the treatment's direct and indirect\\neffects, respectively. We start by formally defining these measures using\\nnested potential outcomes. Next, we formulate the conditions for the\\nidentification of the DNNT and INNT, as well as for the direct and indirect\\nnumber needed to expose (DNNE and INNE, respectively) and the direct and\\nindirect exposure impact number (DEIN and IEIN, respectively) in observational\\nstudies. Next, we present an estimation method with two analytical examples. A\\ncorresponding simulation study follows the examples. The simulation study\\nillustrates that the estimators of the novel indices are consistent, and their\\nanalytical confidence intervals meet the nominal coverage rates.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T17:39:47Z\"}"}
