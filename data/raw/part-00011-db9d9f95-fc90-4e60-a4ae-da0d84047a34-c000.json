Vision transformers\\nhave been trained using JEPA to produce embeddings from images and videos,\\nwhich have been shown to be highly suitable for downstream tasks like\\nclassification and segmentation. In this paper, we show how to adapt the JEPA\\narchitecture to reinforcement learning from images. We discuss model collapse,\\nshow how to prevent it, and provide exemplary data on the classical Cart Pole\\ntask.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T10:16:12Z\"}"}
