{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05276v1\", \"title\": \"Three-dimensional femtoscopy for proton pairs in heavy-ion collisions\", \"summary\": \"Femtoscopy, a technique of measuring the size and the dynamics of the system\\ncreated in heavy-ion collisions is used extensively in experiments at RHIC,\\nLHC, SPS, and the FAIR/GSI. Analysis for pairs of pions is most common, due to\\ntheir large abundance in the collisions, as well as well-understood theoretical\\nformalism and advanced experimental methodology. It is usually performed in\\nthree dimensions in longitudinally co-moving reference frame of the pair, to\\nmaximize the amount of information obtained about the source. Similar\\nthree-dimensional analysis has also been performed for charged and neutral\\nkaons. In contrast analyses for all other pair types -- either for pairs of\\nidentical protons, or for pairs of non-identical particles are only\\none-dimensional. The abundance of heavier particles is lower than for pions,\\nwhile the theoretical formalism for such correlations, as well as practical\\nexperimental methodology is limited to one-dimensional case up to now. This\\nwork identifies specific challenges arising in the analysis of\\nthree-dimensional proton-proton femtoscopy and proposes a theoretical formalism\\nto analyze them, as well as specific experimental methods to extract and fit\\ncorrelations. A test and validation of these methods is performed on\\ncorrelations simulated in the LHyquid+Therminator2 model, and demonstrates the\\nfeasibility of such analysis. The caveats in the theoretical interpretation of\\nthe results are discussed, by comparing the fitted values of femtscopic radii\\nwith the true characteristics of the source extracted directly from the model.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex,hep-ph,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:22:40Z\"}"}
