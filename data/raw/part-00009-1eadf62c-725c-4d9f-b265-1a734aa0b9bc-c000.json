The method combines a\\nforward-backward solver for online velocity optimization with a novel spatial\\nsampling strategy for local trajectory planning, utilizing a three-dimensional\\ntrack representation. The computed velocity profile serves as a reference for\\nthe local planner, ensuring adaptability to environmental and vehicle dynamics.\\nWe demonstrate the approach's robust performance and computational efficiency\\nin racing scenarios and discuss its limitations, including sensitivity to\\ndeviations from the predefined racing line and high jerk characteristics of the\\nvelocity profile.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T11:53:56Z\"}"}
