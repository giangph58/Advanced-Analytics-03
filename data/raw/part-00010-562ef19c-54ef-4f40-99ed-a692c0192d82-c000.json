The system uses a structure-from-motion approach to\\nreconstruct 3D representations of the plants via point clouds. Using wheat as\\nan example, we demonstrate how various phenotypic traits can be computed easily\\nfrom the point clouds. These include standard measurements such as plant height\\nand radius, as well as features that would be more cumbersome to measure by\\nhand, such as leaf angles and convex hull. We further demonstrate the utility\\nof the system through the investigation of specific metrics that may yield\\nobjective classifications of erectophile versus planophile wheat canopy\\narchitectures.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T16:02:52Z\"}"}
