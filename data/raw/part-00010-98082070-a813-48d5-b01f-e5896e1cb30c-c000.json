In early 2025, an unusual seismic sequence occurred close to\\nSantorini, providing new insight into these interactions. Here we show that the\\nsequence was likely initiated by the accumulation and migration of fluids\\nbeneath the volcanic complex. Seismic and ground deformation data reveal a\\nprogression from deep fluid buildup and microfracturing to the concentration of\\nshallow earthquakes beneath Columbo volcano. This culminated in a four-day\\nseismic episode that behaved like a single, slow-propagating rupture along a\\n16-kilometer fault, releasing energy equivalent to a magnitude 6.2 earthquake.\\nThe rupture was followed by a typical aftershock sequence. These observations\\nsuggest that fluid-driven processes can generate large earthquakes and\\nredistribute stress in ways similar to tectonic mainshocks. This challenges\\nconventional views on how seismic and volcanic hazards are connected and\\nassessed.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.geo-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.geo-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T07:07:50Z\"}"}
