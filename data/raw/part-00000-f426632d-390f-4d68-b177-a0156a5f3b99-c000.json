Safety is achieved by\\nmanaging actuation (where electric signals are used to trigger physical\\nmovement), dependent on corresponding sensor readings; used as ground truth in\\ndecision making. Timely detection of anomalies (attacks, faults and\\nunascertained states) in ICSs is crucial for the safe running of a plant, the\\nsafety of its personnel, and for the safe provision of any services provided.\\nWe propose an anomaly detection method that involves accurate linearization of\\nthe non-linear forms arising from sensor-actuator(s) relationships, primarily\\nbecause solving linear models is easier and well understood. Further, the time\\ncomplexity of the anomaly detection scenario/problem at hand is lowered using\\ndimensionality reduction of the actuator(s) in relationship with a sensor. We\\naccomplish this by using a well-known water treatment testbed as a use case.\\nOur experiments show millisecond time response to detect anomalies and provide\\nexplainability; that are not simultaneously achieved by other state of the art\\nAI/ML models with eXplainable AI (XAI) used for the same purpose. Further, we\\npin-point the sensor(s) and its actuation state for which anomaly was detected.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T16:24:11Z\"}"}
