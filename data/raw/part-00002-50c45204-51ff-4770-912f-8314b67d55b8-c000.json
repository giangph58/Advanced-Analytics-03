This work presents the first\\nneural network controller for drone racing that generalizes across physically\\ndistinct quadcopters. We demonstrate that a single network, trained with domain\\nrandomization, can robustly control various types of quadcopters. The network\\nrelies solely on the current state to directly compute motor commands. The\\neffectiveness of this generalized controller is validated through real-world\\ntests on two substantially different crafts (3-inch and 5-inch race\\nquadcopters). We further compare the performance of this generalized controller\\nwith controllers specifically trained for the 3-inch and 5-inch drone, using\\ntheir identified model parameters with varying levels of domain randomization\\n(0%, 10%, 20%, 30%). While the generalized controller shows slightly slower\\nspeeds compared to the fine-tuned models, it excels in adaptability across\\ndifferent platforms. Our results show that no randomization fails sim-to-real\\ntransfer while increasing randomization improves robustness but reduces speed.\\nDespite this trade-off, our findings highlight the potential of domain\\nrandomization for generalizing controllers, paving the way for universal AI\\ncontrollers that can adapt to any platform.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T12:44:41Z\"}"}
