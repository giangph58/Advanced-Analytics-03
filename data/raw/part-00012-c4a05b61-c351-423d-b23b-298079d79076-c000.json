We\\naddress these challenges by learning the climatological distribution of a\\ntarget wind farm using its high-resolution numerical weather simulations. An\\noptimal combination of this learned high-resolution climatological prior with\\ncoarse-grid large scale forecasts yields highly accurate, fine-grained,\\nfull-variable, large ensemble of weather pattern forecasts. Using observed\\nmeteorological records and wind turbine power outputs as references, the\\nproposed methodology verifies advantageously compared to existing\\nnumerical/statistical forecasting-downscaling pipelines, regarding either\\ndeterministic/probabilistic skills or economic gains. Moreover, a 100-member,\\n10-day forecast with spatial resolution of 1 km and output frequency of 15 min\\ntakes < 1 hour on a moderate-end GPU, as contrast to $\\\\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ CPU\\nhours for conventional numerical simulation. By drastically reducing\\ncomputational costs while maintaining accuracy, our method paves the way for\\nmore efficient and reliable renewable energy planning and operation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,physics.ao-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T13:20:36Z\"}"}
