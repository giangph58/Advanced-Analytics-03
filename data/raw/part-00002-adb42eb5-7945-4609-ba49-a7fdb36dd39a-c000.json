{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16809v1\", \"title\": \"Rotating effects on the Hall conductivity in a quantum dot\", \"summary\": \"We investigate the behavior of the quantized Hall conductivity in a\\ntwo-dimensional quantum system under rotating effects, a uniform magnetic\\nfield, and an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux tube. By varying the angular velocity and\\nthe AB flux, we analyze their impact on the formation, shifting, and structure\\nof quantized Hall plateaus. Our results reveal that rotation modifies the\\nenergy spectrum, leading to slight shifts in the plateau positions and\\nvariations in their widths. Additionally, we identify Aharonov-Bohm-type\\noscillations in $\\\\sigma_{\\\\text{Hall}}$, which become more pronounced for lower\\nvalues of the cyclotron frequency $\\\\omega_c$, indicating enhanced quantum\\ninterference effects in the low-field regime. These oscillations are further\\nmodulated by $\\\\Omega$, affecting their periodicity and amplitude. The interplay\\nbetween the confinement frequency $\\\\omega_0$, the cyclotron frequency\\n$\\\\omega_c$, and the rotational effects plays a crucial role in determining the\\noverall behavior of $\\\\sigma_{\\\\text{Hall}}$. Our findings provide insights into\\nthe interplay between rotation, magnetic field, and quantum interference\\neffects, which are relevant for experimental investigations of quantum Hall\\nsystems in rotating systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:27:08Z\"}"}
