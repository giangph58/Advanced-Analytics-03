Our results suggest strong signatures of Hund's metal\\nphysics in this compound. The Co 3$d$ states show large orbital differentiation\\nin the degree of correlations and mass enhancement. The imaginary-time\\ncorrelation functions suggest the presence of spin-orbital separation and large\\nlocal charge fluctuations in the system. Breakdown of the Fermi-liquid picture\\nis observed at the lowest calculated temperature for various strengths of\\nHund's coupling, suggesting the Fermi-liquid coherence scale lower than\\n$\\\\sim$100 K. Interestingly, a sudden emergence of a gapped state is noted for\\n$e_g$ orbitals in its spectral density of states at $\\\\sim$200 K in the vicinity\\nof Fermi-level. Among the Co 3$d$ states 3$d_{z^2}$ and 3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ foster\\nenlarged correlations. This study conclusively identifies $\\\\mathrm{Sr_2CoO_4}$\\nas the first single-layered 3$d$ transition metal oxide to be classified as\\nHund's metal.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T05:50:25Z\"}"}
