This study introduces the\\nDRone-derived Intelligence For Traffic analysis (DRIFT) dataset, a large-scale\\nurban traffic dataset collected systematically from synchronized drone videos\\nat approximately 250 meters altitude, covering nine interconnected\\nintersections in Daejeon, South Korea. DRIFT provides high-resolution vehicle\\ntrajectories that include directional information, processed through video\\nsynchronization and orthomap alignment, resulting in a comprehensive dataset of\\n81,699 vehicle trajectories. Through our DRIFT dataset, researchers can\\nsimultaneously analyze traffic at multiple scales - from individual vehicle\\nmaneuvers like lane-changes and safety metrics such as time-to-collision to\\naggregate network flow dynamics across interconnected urban intersections. The\\nDRIFT dataset is structured to enable immediate use without additional\\npreprocessing, complemented by open-source models for object detection and\\ntrajectory extraction, as well as associated analytical tools. DRIFT is\\nexpected to significantly contribute to academic research and practical\\napplications, such as traffic flow analysis and simulation studies. The dataset\\nand related resources are publicly accessible at\\nhttps://github.com/AIxMobility/The-DRIFT.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T09:43:13Z\"}"}
