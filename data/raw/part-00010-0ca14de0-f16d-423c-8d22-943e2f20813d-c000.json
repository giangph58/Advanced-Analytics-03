{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21754v1\", \"title\": \"Virtual Atom-Photon Bound States and Spontaneous Emission Control\", \"summary\": \"In waveguide quantum electrodynamics systems, atomic radiation emission is\\nshaped by the photonic environment and collective atom interactions, offering\\npromising applications in quantum technologies. In particular, atom-photon\\nbound states, inhibiting complete spontaneous decay of the atom, can be\\nrealized through waveguide dispersion engineering or by utilizing giant atoms.\\nWhile steady-state bound states are well understood, transient or virtual bound\\nstates remain less explored. Here we investigate transient atom-photon bound\\nstates, arising from initial atom-photon entanglement, and propose methods to\\nslow down spontaneous atomic decay.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T15:49:35Z\"}"}
