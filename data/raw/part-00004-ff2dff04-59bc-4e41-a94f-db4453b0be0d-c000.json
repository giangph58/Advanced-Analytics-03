{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15036v1\", \"title\": \"Dynamic Robustness Verification Against Weak Memory (Extended Version)\", \"summary\": \"Dynamic race detection is a highly effective runtime verification technique\\nfor identifying data races by instrumenting and monitoring concurrent program\\nruns. However, standard dynamic race detection is incompatible with practical\\nweak memory models; the added instrumentation introduces extra synchronization,\\nwhich masks weakly consistent behaviors and inherently misses certain data\\nraces. In response, we propose to dynamically verify program robustness-a\\nproperty ensuring that a program exhibits only strongly consistent behaviors.\\nBuilding on an existing static decision procedures, we develop an algorithm for\\ndynamic robustness verification under a C11-style memory model. The algorithm\\nis based on \\\"location clocks\\\", a variant of vector clocks used in standard race\\ndetection. It allows effective and easy-to-apply defense against weak memory on\\na per-program basis, which can be combined with race detection that assumes\\nstrong consistency. We implement our algorithm in a tool, called RSAN, and\\nevaluate it across various settings. To our knowledge, this work is the first\\nto propose and develop dynamic verification of robustness against weak memory\\nmodels.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.PL\", \"categories\": \"cs.PL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T11:44:58Z\"}"}
