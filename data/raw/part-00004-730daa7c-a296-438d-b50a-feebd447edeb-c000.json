{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20004v1\", \"title\": \"Socially-Aware Autonomous Driving: Inferring Yielding Intentions for\\n  Safer Interactions\", \"summary\": \"Since the emergence of autonomous driving technology, it has advanced rapidly\\nover the past decade. It is becoming increasingly likely that autonomous\\nvehicles (AVs) would soon coexist with human-driven vehicles (HVs) on the\\nroads. Currently, safety and reliable decision-making remain significant\\nchallenges, particularly when AVs are navigating lane changes and interacting\\nwith surrounding HVs. Therefore, precise estimation of the intentions of\\nsurrounding HVs can assist AVs in making more reliable and safe lane change\\ndecision-making. This involves not only understanding their current behaviors\\nbut also predicting their future motions without any direct communication.\\nHowever, distinguishing between the passing and yielding intentions of\\nsurrounding HVs still remains ambiguous. To address the challenge, we propose a\\nsocial intention estimation algorithm rooted in Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG),\\ncoupled with a decision-making framework employing Deep Reinforcement Learning\\n(DRL) algorithms. To evaluate the method's performance, the proposed framework\\ncan be tested and applied in a lane-changing scenario within a simulated\\nenvironment. Furthermore, the experiment results demonstrate how our approach\\nenhances the ability of AVs to navigate lane changes safely and efficiently on\\nroads.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:24:04Z\"}"}
