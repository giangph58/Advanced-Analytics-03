Notably, this family\\nconjecturally contains infinitely many graphs with coherent rank $6$. Our\\nconstruction also provides the first known examples that answer a question\\nposed by Evans, Goryainov, and Panasenko regarding the existence of Neumaier\\ngraphs whose nexus is not a power of $2$. In addition, we show that a\\nconstruction of Greaves and Koolen yields an infinite family of Neumaier graphs\\nwith coherent rank $6$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T12:35:02Z\"}"}
