In particular, we demonstrate the explicit map\\nbetween covariant spacetime fields and the string fields in the flat-vertex\\nframe to the leading few orders in perturbation theory. We further consider a\\nBatalin-Vilkovisky system of extended string fields that manifests\\ndiffeomorphism invariance and allows for extending certain perturbative SFT\\nsolutions to the large field regime.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T17:53:58Z\"}"}
