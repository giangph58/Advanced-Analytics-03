Clinicians utilize advanced\\nComputer-Aided Design techniques to create patient-specific treatment plans\\nthat include laboriously identifying crucial landmarks such as cusps,\\nmesial-distal locations, facial axis points, and tooth-gingiva boundaries.\\nDetecting such landmarks automatically presents challenges, including limited\\ndataset sizes, significant anatomical variability among subjects, and the\\ngeometric nature of the data. We present our experiments from the 3DTeethLand\\nGrand Challenge at MICCAI 2024. Our method leverages recent advancements in\\npoint cloud learning through transformer architectures. We designed a Point\\nTransformer v3 inspired module to capture meaningful geometric and anatomical\\nfeatures, which are processed by a lightweight decoder to predict per-point\\ndistances, further processed by graph-based non-minima suppression. We report\\npromising results and discuss insights on learned feature interpretability.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T17:34:56Z\"}"}
