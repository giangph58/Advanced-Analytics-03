In many of these scenarios, the quantum state of the probe is flipped\\nregularly by the application of ${\\\\pi}$-pulses to accumulate information about\\nthe target periodic-field. The emergence of a discrete time crystalline phase,\\nas a nonequilibrium phase of matter, naturally provides oscillations in a\\nmany-body system with an inherent controllable frequency. They benefit from\\nlong coherence time and robustness against imperfections, which makes them\\nexcellent potential quantum sensors. In this paper, through theoretical and\\nnumerical analysis, we show that a disorder-free discrete time crystal probe\\ncan reach the ultimate achievable precision for sensing a periodic-field. As\\nthe amplitude of the periodic-field increases, the discrete time crystalline\\norder diminishes, and the performance of the probe decreases remarkably.\\nNevertheless, the obtained quantum enhancement in the discrete time crystal\\nphase shows robustness against different imperfections in the protocol.\\nFinally, we propose the implementation of our protocol in ultra-cold atoms in\\noptical lattices.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T06:53:39Z\"}"}
