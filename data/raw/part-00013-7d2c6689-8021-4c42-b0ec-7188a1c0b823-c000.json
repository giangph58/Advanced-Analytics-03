This could be achieved,\\nfor example, by growing the graphene layer on top of a transition metal\\ndichalcogenide, such as WS$_2$. Here, we focus on the ballistic, wide, and\\nshort junction limits and study the effects of the spin-orbit interaction on\\nthe supercurrent. In particular, we analyze the current phase relation using an\\nanalytical approach based on the continuum model. We find combinations of types\\nof spin-orbit coupling that significantly suppress the supercurrent by opening\\na gap in the graphene band structure. At the same time, other combinations\\nenhance it, acting as an effective spin-valley resolved chemical potential.\\nMoreover, we find that a strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling leads to a junction\\nwith a highly voltage tunable harmonic content.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.supr-con,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T12:59:15Z\"}"}
