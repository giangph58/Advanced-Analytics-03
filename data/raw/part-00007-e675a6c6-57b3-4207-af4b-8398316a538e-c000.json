{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13131v1\", \"title\": \"NTIRE 2025 Challenge on Short-form UGC Video Quality Assessment and\\n  Enhancement: Methods and Results\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents a review for the NTIRE 2025 Challenge on Short-form UGC\\nVideo Quality Assessment and Enhancement. The challenge comprises two tracks:\\n(i) Efficient Video Quality Assessment (KVQ), and (ii) Diffusion-based Image\\nSuper-Resolution (KwaiSR). Track 1 aims to advance the development of\\nlightweight and efficient video quality assessment (VQA) models, with an\\nemphasis on eliminating reliance on model ensembles, redundant weights, and\\nother computationally expensive components in the previous IQA/VQA\\ncompetitions. Track 2 introduces a new short-form UGC dataset tailored for\\nsingle image super-resolution, i.e., the KwaiSR dataset. It consists of 1,800\\nsynthetically generated S-UGC image pairs and 1,900 real-world S-UGC images,\\nwhich are split into training, validation, and test sets using a ratio of\\n8:1:1. The primary objective of the challenge is to drive research that\\nbenefits the user experience of short-form UGC platforms such as Kwai and\\nTikTok. This challenge attracted 266 participants and received 18 valid final\\nsubmissions with corresponding fact sheets, significantly contributing to the\\nprogress of short-form UGC VQA and image superresolution. The project is\\npublicly available at https://github.com/lixinustc/KVQE-\\nChallengeCVPR-NTIRE2025.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.AI,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:45:34Z\"}"}
