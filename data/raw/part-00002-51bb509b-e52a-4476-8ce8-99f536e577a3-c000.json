These materials exhibit\\nstrong spin-charge coupling because the energy scales of the electronic and\\nspin systems are of the same order. The photocurrent response exhibits a\\npronounced peak reflecting the presence of the Dirac point at the resonance\\nfrequency of the localized spin system. This contribution plays a crucial role\\nin the photocurrent generation when the electronic filling is set around the\\nDirac nodes in the Dirac semimetal. We also reveal that the photocurrent\\nresponse exhibits a low-frequency divergence due to the modulation of the\\nresonance frequency of the localized spin system. Our findings clarify that the\\nphotocurrent response arising from the spin dynamics reflects the band topology\\nof the Dirac semimetals, and the localized spin dynamics plays an important\\nrole in the photocurrent generation.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T05:18:56Z\"}"}
