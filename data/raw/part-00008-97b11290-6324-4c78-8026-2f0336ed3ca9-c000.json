{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17698v1\", \"title\": \"Self-Supervised Noise Adaptive MRI Denoising via Repetition to\\n  Repetition (Rep2Rep) Learning\", \"summary\": \"Purpose: This work proposes a novel self-supervised noise-adaptive image\\ndenoising framework, called Repetition to Repetition (Rep2Rep) learning, for\\nlow-field (<1T) MRI applications. Methods: Rep2Rep learning extends the\\nNoise2Noise framework by training a neural network on two repeated MRI\\nacquisitions, using one repetition as input and another as target, without\\nrequiring ground-truth data. It incorporates noise-adaptive training, enabling\\ndenoising generalization across varying noise levels and flexible inference\\nwith any number of repetitions. Performance was evaluated on both synthetic\\nnoisy brain MRI and 0.55T prostate MRI data, and compared against supervised\\nlearning and Monte Carlo Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (MC-SURE). Results:\\nRep2Rep learning outperforms MC-SURE on both synthetic and 0.55T MRI datasets.\\nOn synthetic brain data, it achieved denoising quality comparable to supervised\\nlearning and surpassed MC-SURE, particularly in preserving structural details\\nand reducing residual noise. On the 0.55T prostate MRI dataset, a reader study\\nshowed radiologists preferred Rep2Rep-denoised 2-average images over 8-average\\nnoisy images. Rep2Rep demonstrated robustness to noise-level discrepancies\\nbetween training and inference, supporting its practical implementation.\\nConclusion: Rep2Rep learning offers an effective self-supervised denoising for\\nlow-field MRI by leveraging routinely acquired multi-repetition data. Its\\nnoise-adaptivity enables generalization to different SNR regimes without clean\\nreference images. This makes Rep2Rep learning a promising tool for improving\\nimage quality and scan efficiency in low-field MRI.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T16:07:45Z\"}"}
