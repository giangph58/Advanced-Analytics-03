Among them, the least studied are qT/Q\\ncorrections, which become significant at large values of transverse momentum.\\nThese corrections partially originate from higher-twist TMD distributions,\\nwhich exhibit singularity at small transverse distances. We propose a\\ndecomposition that reveals this singularity explicitly, and makes the qT/Q\\ncorrection manifest. As a concrete application, we consider the next-to-leading\\npower correction for the angular distributions in Drell-Yan, and determine the\\nleading qT/Q corrections. These corrections are significant for the angular\\ndistributions A1 and A3, in complete agreement with the data.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex,hep-lat,nucl-ex,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:22:40Z\"}"}
