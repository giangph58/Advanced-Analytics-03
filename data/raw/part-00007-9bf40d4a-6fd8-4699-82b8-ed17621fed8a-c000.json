The analytical calculations reveal\\nthe optimal parametric gain and phase parameters for achieving optimum\\nunconventional photon blockade conditions. Under the optimal parameter regime,\\nthe numerical results of the second-order correlation function demonstrate\\nstrong photon antibunching consistent with the analytical results. Furthermore,\\nthe numerical results corroborate that coherently driving the atom leads to a\\nstronger photon blockade than a coherently driven cavity with the optimal\\nparameters. We numerically demonstrate that the UPB effect is compromised by a\\nnon-zero cavity-atom coupling in the cavity-driven configuration. However,\\nstronger photon antibunching can be attained with a non-zero cavity-atom\\ncoupling in the atom-driven configuration. This work may be suitable for\\nexperimentally realising a strongly antibunched single-photon source for\\napplications in quantum technology.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T09:34:21Z\"}"}
