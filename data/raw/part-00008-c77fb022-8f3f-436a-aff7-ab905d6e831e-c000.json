Majorana-based tetron qubits are predicted to\\nexhibit error rates that decrease exponentially with inverse temperature and\\nlength of each topological superconducting wire in the tetron. In contrast to\\nthis prediction, we show that errors arising from small variations in the\\nchemical potential grow linearly with tetron length at zero temperature. These\\nerrors stem from leakage into excited quasiparticle states, which ultimately\\npoison Majorana modes at opposite ends of the tetron, causing errors. We\\nfurther demonstrate that the dynamics of this leakage is captured by the half\\nLandau-Zener effect, which dictates its dependence on key system parameters\\nsuch as the superconducting gap, chemical potential variations, and dynamic\\nchanges in the spatial profile of Majorana modes. These results motivate\\nfurther investigations into the impact of leakage on qubit performance and\\npotential mitigation strategies.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T12:22:31Z\"}"}
