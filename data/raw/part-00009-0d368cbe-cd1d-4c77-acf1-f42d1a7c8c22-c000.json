{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15024v1\", \"title\": \"Extending Collinear Density Functionals to Noncollinear Cases under\\n  Periodic Boundary Condition\", \"summary\": \"Accurate modeling of spin-orbit coupling and noncollinear magnetism in\\nmaterials requires noncollinear density functionals within the two-component\\ngeneralized Kohn-Sham (GKS) framework, yet constructing and implementing\\nnoncollinear functionals remains challenging. Recently, a methodology was\\nproposed to extend collinear functionals into noncollinear ones, successfully\\ndefining noncollinear functionals and their derivatives. However, the initial\\nimplementation involved a systematic approach to differentiate energy over\\ndensity matrix elements rather than the derivatives of the energy functional\\nwith respect to density, presenting challenges for integration with periodic\\nboundary condition-density functional theory (PBC-DFT) software. We have\\nderived a novel set of working equations based on the original methodology,\\nwhich provides noncollinear energy functionals and their derivatives. These\\nworking equations have been implemented in our noncollinear functional ensemble\\nnamed NCXC, ensuring numerical stability and transferability without the need\\nfor incorporating derivatives of basis functions. This implementation is\\nexpected to facilitate compatibility with most DFT software packages. We\\ndemonstrate some preliminary applications in periodic systems, including\\nnoncollinear magnetism in spin spirals, band structures in topological\\ninsulators, and band gaps in semiconducting inorganic materials, using NCXC.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T11:11:59Z\"}"}
