In general,\\ntrapped ions are considered to have sufficiently long coherence times, which\\nare mainly characterized under laser-free conditions. However, in reality,\\nessential laser fields for quantum manipulation introduce residual light shift,\\nwhich seriously degrades the coherence due to power fluctuations. Here, we\\npresent a comprehensive study of AC Stark shifts in the hyperfine energy levels\\nof the $^{171}\\\\mathrm{Yb}^+$ ion, revealing an asymmetric light shift between\\ntwo circular polarizations in the clock qubit and pronounced vector light\\nshifts in the Zeeman qubits. By precisely tuning these polarizations, a\\nremarkable enhancement in coherence time is observed, reaching over a\\nhundredfold for the clock qubit and more than tenfold for the Zeeman qubits,\\nwhen comparing conditions of maximum and minimum shifts. These findings advance\\nthe practical realization of scalable trapped-ion quantum processors, enabling\\ndeep quantum circuit execution and long duration adiabatic operations.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T04:30:32Z\"}"}
