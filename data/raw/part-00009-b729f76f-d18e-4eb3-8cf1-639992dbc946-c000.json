{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03480v1\", \"title\": \"Modeling Musical Genre Trajectories through Pathlet Learning\", \"summary\": \"The increasing availability of user data on music streaming platforms opens\\nup new possibilities for analyzing music consumption. However, understanding\\nthe evolution of user preferences remains a complex challenge, particularly as\\ntheir musical tastes change over time. This paper uses the dictionary learning\\nparadigm to model user trajectories across different musical genres. We define\\na new framework that captures recurring patterns in genre trajectories, called\\npathlets, enabling the creation of comprehensible trajectory embeddings. We\\nshow that pathlet learning reveals relevant listening patterns that can be\\nanalyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. This work improves our\\nunderstanding of users' interactions with music and opens up avenues of\\nresearch into user behavior and fostering diversity in recommender systems. A\\ndataset of 2000 user histories tagged by genre over 17 months, supplied by\\nDeezer (a leading music streaming company), is also released with the code.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR,cs.LG,cs.MM\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T12:33:40Z\"}"}
