Our approach leverages the\\nSchr\\\\\\\"odingerisation technique, which converts linear partial and ordinary\\ndifferential equations with non-unitary dynamics into a system evolved by\\nunitary dynamics. This is achieved through a warped phase transformation that\\nlifts the problem into a higher-dimensional space, enabling the simulation of\\nthe Black-Scholes equation on a quantum computer. We will conduct a thorough\\ncomplexity analysis to highlight the quantum advantages of our approach\\ncompared to existing algorithms. The effectiveness of our quantum circuit is\\nsubstantiated through extensive numerical experiments.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.NA,math.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T10:21:12Z\"}"}
