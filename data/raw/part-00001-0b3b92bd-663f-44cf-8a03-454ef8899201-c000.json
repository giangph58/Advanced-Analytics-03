We find integer conductance steps depending on the energy window of the\\nincoming electrons for conical magnets in different orientations and a\\nmodulated magnetic field profile. The conductance windows, that we attribute to\\npotential or diffractive scattering, are characterized by spin selectivity\\ndepending on the magnetic field direction and chirality.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T09:06:38Z\"}"}
