The best known agnostic learner for the\\nclass of disjunctions over $\\\\{0, 1\\\\}^n$ is the $L_1$-polynomial regression\\nalgorithm, achieving complexity $2^{\\\\tilde{O}(n^{1/2})}$. This complexity bound\\nis known to be nearly best possible within the class of Correlational\\nStatistical Query (CSQ) algorithms. In this work, we develop an agnostic\\nlearner for this concept class with complexity $2^{\\\\tilde{O}(n^{1/3})}$. Our\\nalgorithm can be implemented in the Statistical Query (SQ) model, providing the\\nfirst separation between the SQ and CSQ models in distribution-free agnostic\\nlearning.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.DS,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T17:16:14Z\"}"}
