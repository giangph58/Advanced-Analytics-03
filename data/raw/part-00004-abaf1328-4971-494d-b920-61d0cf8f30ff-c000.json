{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17309v1\", \"title\": \"CoheMark: A Novel Sentence-Level Watermark for Enhanced Text Quality\", \"summary\": \"Watermarking technology is a method used to trace the usage of content\\ngenerated by large language models. Sentence-level watermarking aids in\\npreserving the semantic integrity within individual sentences while maintaining\\ngreater robustness. However, many existing sentence-level watermarking\\ntechniques depend on arbitrary segmentation or generation processes to embed\\nwatermarks, which can limit the availability of appropriate sentences. This\\nlimitation, in turn, compromises the quality of the generated response. To\\naddress the challenge of balancing high text quality with robust watermark\\ndetection, we propose CoheMark, an advanced sentence-level watermarking\\ntechnique that exploits the cohesive relationships between sentences for better\\nlogical fluency. The core methodology of CoheMark involves selecting sentences\\nthrough trained fuzzy c-means clustering and applying specific next sentence\\nselection criteria. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that CoheMark achieves\\nstrong watermark strength while exerting minimal impact on text quality.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T07:08:13Z\"}"}
