{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03650v1\", \"title\": \"Rapid, Broadband, Optical Spectroscopy of Cold Radicals\", \"summary\": \"Optical spectroscopy of molecular radicals is an important tool in physical\\nchemistry, and is a prerequisite for many experiments which use molecules for\\nquantum science and precision measurement. However, even the simplest molecules\\nhave complex spectra which can be very time consuming to measure. Here we\\npresent an approach which offers the ability to measure the optical spectra of\\ncryogenically-cooled molecular radicals with much greater efficiency. By\\ncombining a supercontinuum laser with a cryogenic buffer gas molecular source\\nand a commercial optical spectrometer, we realize 15 nm of simultaneous\\nbandwidth with 0.56 pm $(\\\\approx 0.5$ GHz) resolution and high sensitivity. As\\na demonstration we measure and assign hundreds of lines and dozens of molecular\\nconstants from 15 bands in the $B^2\\\\Sigma^+-X^2\\\\Sigma^+$ system of CaF,\\nincluding a low-abundance isotopologue, in a few hours. The setup is robust,\\nsimple, and should enable spectroscopy of molecular radicals with much higher\\nthroughput.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph,physics.ins-det\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:57:00Z\"}"}
