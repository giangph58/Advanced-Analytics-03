Although the literature usually provides a lower bound on\\nthis probability, we present an improved bound. The derived formulas enable the\\nidentification of all failure cases in Shor's algorithm, which correspond to a\\nsuccess probability of zero. A simulation routine is provided to evaluate the\\ntheoretical success probability for a given integer when its prime\\nfactorization is known with potential applications in quantum resource\\nestimation and algorithm benchmarking.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T10:08:58Z\"}"}
