Our results allow for a situation where the dominant component\\nof the Hoeffding decomposition is absent or unknown, including cases with known\\ndegrees of degeneracy as special forms. The obtained error bounds for Gaussian\\napproximations are sharp enough to almost recover the weakest bandwidth\\ncondition of small bandwidth asymptotics in the fixed-dimensional setting when\\napplied to a canonical semiparametric estimation problem. We also present an\\napplication to an adaptive goodness-of-fit testing, along with discussions\\nabout several potential applications.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T04:58:58Z\"}"}
