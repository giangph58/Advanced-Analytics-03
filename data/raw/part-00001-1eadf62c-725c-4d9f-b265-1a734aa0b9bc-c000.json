{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05149v1\", \"title\": \"Temporal Spectrum Analysis for Multi-Constellation Space Domain\\n  Awareness\", \"summary\": \"Space Domain Awareness (SDA) system has different major aspects including\\ncontinues and robust awareness from the network that is crucial for an\\nefficient control over all actors in space. The observability of the space\\nassets on the other hand requires efficient analysis on when and how observed\\nspace objects can be controlled. This becomes crucial when real-world spatial\\ndynamics are taken into account as it introduces complexities into the system.\\nThe real-world dynamics can reveal the structure of the network including\\nisolated and dominant stations. We propose a Temporal Spectrum Analysis (TSA)\\nscheme that takes into account a set of real-world parameters including actual\\ndynamics of the objects in space to analyze the structure of a ground-space\\nnetwork that inherits temporal spectrum as the key element of design. We study\\nthe potential interactions between multiple constellations using TSA and\\nconduct a comprehensive real-world simulations to quantify the structure of the\\nnetwork. Numerical results show how the temporal spectrum of each satellite\\naffects the intra- and inter-constellation network structure including\\ninteractions between ground stations and constellations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T11:40:56Z\"}"}
