When $N \\\\geq 4$ and $\\\\mu>0$, we will show that the above problem has a\\npositive Mountain pass solution, which is also a ground state solution. At the\\nsame time, when $\\\\mu<0$, under some assumptions on the $N$, $\\\\mu$, $\\\\lambda$\\nand $\\\\alpha$, we will show that the above problem has at least a positive least\\nenergy solution and at least a positive Mountain pass solution, respectively.\\nWhat's more, when certain inequality related to $N \\\\geq 3$, $\\\\mu<0 $ and\\n$\\\\alpha\\\\in(-2,0]$ holds, we will demonstrate the non-existence of positive\\nsolutions to the above-mentioned problem. The presence of logarithmic term\\nbrings some new and interesting phenomena to this problem.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:18:48Z\"}"}
