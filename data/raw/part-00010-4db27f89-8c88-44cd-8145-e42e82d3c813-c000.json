{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21619v1\", \"title\": \"LRBO2: Improved 3D Vision Based Hand-Eye Calibration for Collaborative\\n  Robot Arm\", \"summary\": \"Hand-eye calibration is a common problem in the field of collaborative\\nrobotics, involving the determination of the transformation matrix between the\\nvisual sensor and the robot flange to enable vision-based robotic tasks.\\nHowever, this process typically requires multiple movements of the robot arm\\nand an external calibration object, making it both time-consuming and\\ninconvenient, especially in scenarios where frequent recalibration is\\nnecessary. In this work, we extend our previous method, Look at Robot Base Once\\n(LRBO), which eliminates the need for external calibration objects such as a\\nchessboard. We propose a generic dataset generation approach for point cloud\\nregistration, focusing on aligning the robot base point cloud with the scanned\\ndata. Furthermore, a more detailed simulation study is conducted involving\\nseveral different collaborative robot arms, followed by real-world experiments\\nin an industrial setting. Our improved method is simulated and evaluated using\\na total of 14 robotic arms from 9 different brands, including KUKA, Universal\\nRobots, UFACTORY, and Franka Emika, all of which are widely used in the field\\nof collaborative robotics. Physical experiments demonstrate that our extended\\napproach achieves performance comparable to existing commercial hand-eye\\ncalibration solutions, while completing the entire calibration procedure in\\njust a few seconds. In addition, we provide a user-friendly hand-eye\\ncalibration solution, with the code publicly available at\\ngithub.com/leihui6/LRBO2.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T13:20:57Z\"}"}
