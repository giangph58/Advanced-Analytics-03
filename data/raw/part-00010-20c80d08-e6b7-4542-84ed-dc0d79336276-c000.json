{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00371v1\", \"title\": \"Control of Photon Dynamics in Non-Euclidean Polygonal Microcavities by\\n  Joint Geometric Curvatures\", \"summary\": \"Non-Euclidean geometry has recently emerged as a powerful tool, offering new\\ninsights and applications in optical microcavities supporting Whispering\\nGallery Modes (WGMs). In this study, we extend the concept of polygonal\\nmicrocavities to non-Euclidean spaces by developing a unified model that\\nincorporates a joint geometric parameter of curvatures. This system uncovers a\\nrange of unexplored phenomena, mechanisms, and concepts that are unique to\\ncurved spaces. Notably, we observe dissipative states characterized by\\nhyperbolic fixed points (HFPs) that appear exclusively in non-Euclidean\\nscenarios, leading to the formation of phase diagrams within the parametric\\nspace of curvatures. Our results reveal phase transitions across geometric\\nboundaries, marked by abrupt changes in the cavity quality factor. These\\ntransitions are strongly influenced by the wavelike nature of photon\\ntrajectories, offering intriguing insights into quantum chaos within curved\\nspaces. Additionally, we discover that cavities with geodesic side lines\\nexhibit a remarkable symmetry-driven avoidance of such phase transitions,\\nhighlighting the profound connection between physical dynamics and spatial\\ngeometry. Our findings establish a promising platform for optical simulations\\nof non-Euclidean quantum chaos and open up potential applications in on-chip\\nphotonic devices.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T07:50:02Z\"}"}
