{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11408v1\", \"title\": \"Five dimensional rotating and Quintessence black hole and their shadows\", \"summary\": \"We present a new five-dimensional rotating quintessence black hole solution.\\nTo obtain this, we employ the $5D$ version of the Janis Newman algorithm, which\\nincorporates the Hopf bifurcation. The variation of the quintessence parameter\\n$w_q$ causes the geometry to transition from a regular rotating universe\\nsurrounded by a cosmological horizon to a singular rotating geometry, which can\\nrepresent a naked singularity, a singular extremal black hole, or a singular\\nblack hole with both an inner and an outer (event) horizon. We have also\\ndetermined the properties of the ergosphere. For the study of the shadow, we\\nfollowed a novel approach in which the $2D$ shadow observed by humans\\ncorresponds to cross-sections of the $3D$ shadow. We analyzed how quintessence\\naffects both the size and shape of the black hole shadow, showing that\\nincreasing the quintessence strength reduces the shadow radius, contrary to the\\nknown results in $4D$. We also propose a speculative methodology to test the\\nshadow behavior in five-dimensional scenarios, in light of the constraints\\nprovided by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) concerning the shadow of the\\nfour-dimensional supermassive black hole M87. We identify scenarios in which\\nthe theoretical $5D$ results could be consistent with these observational\\nconstraints. Finally, we determine the energy conditions required to support\\nthe solution.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T17:26:18Z\"}"}
