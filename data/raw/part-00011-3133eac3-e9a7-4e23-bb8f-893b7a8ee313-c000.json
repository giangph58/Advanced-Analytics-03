Accurate real-time forecasting of drying\\nreadiness is crucial for minimizing energy consumption, improving productivity,\\nand ensuring product quality. However, this remains challenging due to the\\ndynamic nature of drying, limited data availability, and the lack of effective\\npredictive analytical methods. To address this gap, we propose an end-to-end\\nmulti-modal data fusion framework that integrates in-situ video data with\\nprocess parameters for real-time food drying readiness forecasting. Our\\napproach leverages a new encoder-decoder architecture with modality-specific\\nencoders and a transformer-based decoder to effectively extract features while\\npreserving the unique structure of each modality. We apply our approach to\\nsugar cookie drying, where time-to-ready is predicted at each timestamp.\\nExperimental results demonstrate that our model achieves an average prediction\\nerror of only 15 seconds, outperforming state-of-the-art data fusion methods by\\n65.69% and a video-only model by 11.30%. Additionally, our model balances\\nprediction accuracy, model size, and computational efficiency, making it\\nwell-suited for heterogenous industrial datasets. The proposed model is\\nextensible to various other industrial modality fusion tasks for online\\ndecision-making.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T05:37:55Z\"}"}
