Part I:\\n  non-rotating floes\", \"summary\": \"We introduce a comprehensive modeling framework for the dynamics of sea ice\\nfloes using particle, kinetic, and hydrodynamic approaches. Building upon the\\nfoundational work of Ha and Tadmor on the Cucker-Smale model for flocking, we\\nderive a Vlasov-type kinetic formulation and a corresponding hydrodynamic\\ndescription. The particle model incorporates essential physical properties of\\nsea ice floes, including size, position, velocity, and interactions governed by\\nNewtonian mechanics. By extending these principles, the kinetic model captures\\nlarge-scale features through the phase-space distribution, and we also present\\na hydrodynamic model using the velocity moments and a suitable closure\\ncondition. In this paper, as an idea-introductory step, we assume that ice\\nfloes are non-rotating and focus on the linear velocity dynamics. Our approach\\nhighlights the role of contact forces, ocean drag effects, and conservation\\nlaws in the multiscale description of sea ice dynamics, offering a pathway for\\nthe improved understanding and prediction of sea ice behaviors in changing\\nclimatic conditions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:13:10Z\"}"}
