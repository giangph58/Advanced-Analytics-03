{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24204v1\", \"title\": \"Many-to-Many Matching via Sparsity Controlled Optimal Transport\", \"summary\": \"Many-to-many matching seeks to match multiple points in one set and multiple\\npoints in another set, which is a basis for a wide range of data mining\\nproblems. It can be naturally recast in the framework of Optimal Transport\\n(OT). However, existing OT methods either lack the ability to accomplish\\nmany-to-many matching or necessitate careful tuning of a regularization\\nparameter to achieve satisfactory results. This paper proposes a novel\\nmany-to-many matching method to explicitly encode many-to-many constraints\\nwhile preventing the degeneration into one-to-one matching. The proposed method\\nconsists of the following two components. The first component is the matching\\nbudget constraints on each row and column of a transport plan, which specify\\nhow many points can be matched to a point at most. The second component is the\\ndeformed $q$-entropy regularization, which encourages a point to meet the\\nmatching budget maximally. While the deformed $q$-entropy was initially\\nproposed to sparsify a transport plan, we employ it to avoid the degeneration\\ninto one-to-one matching. We optimize the objective via a penalty algorithm,\\nwhich is efficient and theoretically guaranteed to converge. Experimental\\nresults on various tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves good\\nperformance by gleaning meaningful many-to-many matchings.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:22:02Z\"}"}
