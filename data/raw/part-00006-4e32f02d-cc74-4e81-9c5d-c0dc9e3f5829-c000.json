To tackle this problem, we advocate for balancing\\ncorrelative and discriminative relationships among labels to mitigate the risk\\nof overfitting and enhance model performance. To this end, we propose the\\nMulti-Label Visual Prompt Tuning framework, a novel and parameter-efficient\\nmethod that groups classes into multiple class subsets according to label\\nco-occurrence and mutual exclusivity relationships, and then models them\\nrespectively to balance the two relationships. In this work, since each group\\ncontains multiple classes, multiple prompt tokens are adopted within Vision\\nTransformer (ViT) to capture the correlation or discriminative label\\nrelationship within each group, and effectively learn correlation or\\ndiscriminative representations for class subsets. On the other hand, each group\\ncontains multiple group-aware visual representations that may correspond to\\nmultiple classes, and the mixture of experts (MoE) model can cleverly assign\\nthem from the group-aware to the label-aware, adaptively obtaining label-aware\\nrepresentation, which is more conducive to classification. Experiments on\\nmultiple benchmark datasets show that our proposed approach achieves\\ncompetitive results and outperforms SOTA methods on multiple pre-trained\\nmodels.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T08:52:50Z\"}"}
