We present a Lean tactic\\nwhich invokes Canonical to generate proof terms and synthesize programs. The\\ntactic supports higher-order and dependently-typed goals, structural recursion\\nover indexed inductive types, and definitional equality. Canonical finds proofs\\nfor 84% of Natural Number Game problems in 51 seconds total.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LO\", \"categories\": \"cs.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T17:36:10Z\"}"}
