The moment of inertia of pair rotation (P-MoI) has been\\nused as an indicator of pair condensation. [Purpose] We aim to elucidate the\\nfundamental properties of the P-MoI, particularly its dependence on the\\nparticle number and the order parameter. [Method] The P-MoI was evaluated using\\nthe Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) calculations with a monopole pairing\\nHamiltonian and Skyrme density functional theory calculations with different\\ndensity-dependent pairing energy density functionals. [Results] In open-shell\\nnuclei, a negative correlation was found between the P-MoI and the pair\\namplitude, which is the order parameter for the transition from the normal\\nphase to the superconducting phase. Analysis based on the decomposition of the\\nP-MoI into the orbital contributions within the BCS approximation shows that\\nits orbital dependence is very similar to that of the pairing gap.\\n[Conclusions] The P-MoI reflects the influence of both the level density near\\nthe Fermi energy and the pair amplitude.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T09:38:53Z\"}"}
