It does so via the\\nso-called warped phase transformation that maps the original equation into a\\nSchr\\\\\\\"odinger-type equation in one higher dimension\\n\\\\cite{Schrshort,JLY22SchrLong}. We show that by employing a smooth\\ninitialization of the warped phase transform \\\\cite{JLM24SchrBackward},\\nSchr\\\\\\\"odingerization can in fact achieve optimal scaling in matrix queries.\\nThis paper presents the detailed implementation of three smooth initializations\\nfor the Schr\\\\\\\"odingerization method: (a) the cut-off function, (b) the\\nhigher-order polynomial interpolation, and (c) the Fourier transform methods,\\nthat achieve optimality for (a) and near-optimality for (b) and (c). A detailed\\nanalysis of key parameters affecting time complexity is conducted.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T07:46:50Z\"}"}
