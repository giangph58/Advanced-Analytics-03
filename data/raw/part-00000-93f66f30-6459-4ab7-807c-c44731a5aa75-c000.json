S-NOD enables the design of\\nagile decision-making that can rapidly switch between decision options in\\nresponse to a changing environment. In S-NOD, decisions are represented by\\ncontinuous time, yet discrete, opinion spikes. Here, we extend previous\\nanalysis of S-NOD and explore its potential as a nonlinear controller with a\\ntunable balance between robustness and responsiveness. We identify and provide\\nnecessary conditions for the bifurcation that determines the onset of periodic\\nopinion spiking. We leverage this analysis to characterize the tunability of\\nthe input-output threshold for opinion spiking as a function of the model basal\\nsensitivity and the modulation of opinion spiking frequency as a function of\\ninput magnitude past threshold. We conclude with a discussion on S-NOD as a new\\nneuromorphic control block and its extension to distributed spiking\\ncontrollers.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T16:33:21Z\"}"}
