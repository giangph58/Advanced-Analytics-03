{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04197v1\", \"title\": \"Spatial-Wavelength Multiplexing Reliable Photonic Integrated\\n  General-Purpose Analog Computing System\", \"summary\": \"In the \\\"post-Moore era\\\", the growing challenges in traditional computing have\\ndriven renewed interest in analog computing, leading to various proposals for\\nthe development of general-purpose analog computing (GPAC) systems. In this\\nwork, we present a GPAC prototype featuring a silicon photonic chip designed\\nfor fully optical analog computation. This system leverages on-chip\\nmulti-channel architectures to enable parallel processing and utilizes\\nwavelength-division multiplexing to significantly enhance computational\\ncapacity. In addition, we have developed an error-correction algorithm to\\nmonitor processing operations in real time, ensuring the reliability of\\ncomputational results. Experimentally, we demonstrate the system's capability\\nto solve ordinary differential equations and its applications in\\ncommunications, microwave photonics, and image processing. The chip's energy\\nefficiency is evaluated to reach up to 227 tera-operations per second per watt.\\nThrough this research, we provide a novel hardware framework and innovative\\ndirections for analog photonic computing.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T07:52:49Z\"}"}
