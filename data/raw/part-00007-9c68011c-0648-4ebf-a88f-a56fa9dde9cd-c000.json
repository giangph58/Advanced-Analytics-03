In this study, we employ an\\nadaptive control mechanism by which agents may benefit from their environment,\\nthus redefining their individual fitness. Under this setting, a detailed\\nexamination of the co-evolution of individual strategies and resource\\nallocation is carried. Through extensive simulations, we find that the\\nadvantageous environment mechanism not only significantly increases the\\nproportion of cooperators in the system but also influences the resource\\ndistribution among individuals. Additionally, limited resources reinforce\\ncooperative behaviors within the system while shaping the evolutionary dynamics\\nand strategic interactions across different dilemmas. Once the system reaches\\nequilibrium, resource distribution becomes highly imbalanced. To promote fairer\\nresource allocation, we introduce a minimum resource guarantee mechanism. Our\\nresults show that this mechanism not only reduces disparities in resource\\ndistribution across the entire system and among individuals in different\\ndilemmas but also significantly enhances cooperative behavior in higher\\nresource intervals. Finally, to assess the robustness of our model, we further\\nexamine the influence of the advantageous environment on system-wide\\ncooperation in small-world and random graph network models.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T15:00:31Z\"}"}
