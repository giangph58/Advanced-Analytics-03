The EMI model provides a\\nmore detailed description of the heart's electrical activity compared to\\ntraditional monodomain and bidomain models, potentially making it better-suited\\nfor understanding the electrical dynamics of the heart under pathological\\nconditions. In this paper, we derive and verify several analytical solutions\\nfor the EMI model. Specifically, we obtain a family of solutions for a single\\ntwo-dimensional cell in polar coordinates and for a pair of coupled\\nthree-dimensional cells in spherical coordinates. We also introduce a\\nmanufactured solution for N three-dimensional cells in Cartesian coordinates.\\nTo verify the analytical solutions, we conduct numerical experiments using the\\nmortar finite element method combined with operator splitting. The results\\ndemonstrate that the analytical solutions are effective for verifying the\\naccuracy of numerical simulations of the EMI model.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA,math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:33:20Z\"}"}
