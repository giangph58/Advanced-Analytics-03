First, the definition of disjoint\\nCes$\\\\grave{a}$ro-hypercyclic operators is provided, and disjoint\\nCes$\\\\grave{a}$ro-Hypercyclicity Criterion is proposed. Later, two methods are\\nused to prove that operators satisfying this criterion possess disjoint\\nCes$\\\\grave{a}$ro-hypercyclicity. Finally, this paper further investigates\\nweighted shift operators and provides detailed characterizations of the weight\\nsequences for disjoint Ces$\\\\grave{a}$ro-hypercyclic unilateral and bilateral\\nweighted shift operators on sequence spaces.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T14:05:44Z\"}"}
