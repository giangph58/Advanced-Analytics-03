{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13102v1\", \"title\": \"A Multi-task Learning Balanced Attention Convolutional Neural Network\\n  Model for Few-shot Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition\", \"summary\": \"Underwater acoustic target recognition (UATR) is of great significance for\\nthe protection of marine diversity and national defense security. The\\ndevelopment of deep learning provides new opportunities for UATR, but faces\\nchallenges brought by the scarcity of reference samples and complex\\nenvironmental interference. To address these issues, we proposes a multi-task\\nbalanced channel attention convolutional neural network (MT-BCA-CNN). The\\nmethod integrates a channel attention mechanism with a multi-task learning\\nstrategy, constructing a shared feature extractor and multi-task classifiers to\\njointly optimize target classification and feature reconstruction tasks. The\\nchannel attention mechanism dynamically enhances discriminative acoustic\\nfeatures such as harmonic structures while suppressing noise. Experiments on\\nthe Watkins Marine Life Dataset demonstrate that MT-BCA-CNN achieves 97\\\\%\\nclassification accuracy and 95\\\\% $F1$-score in 27-class few-shot scenarios,\\nsignificantly outperforming traditional CNN and ACNN models, as well as popular\\nstate-of-the-art UATR methods. Ablation studies confirm the synergistic\\nbenefits of multi-task learning and attention mechanisms, while a dynamic\\nweighting adjustment strategy effectively balances task contributions. This\\nwork provides an efficient solution for few-shot underwater acoustic\\nrecognition, advancing research in marine bioacoustics and sonar signal\\nprocessing.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SD\", \"categories\": \"cs.SD,cs.AI,eess.AS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:11:32Z\"}"}
