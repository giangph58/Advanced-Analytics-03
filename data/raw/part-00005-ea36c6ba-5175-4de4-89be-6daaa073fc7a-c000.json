{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05117v1\", \"title\": \"Spin-glass quantum phase transition in amorphous arrays of Rydberg atoms\", \"summary\": \"The experiments performed with neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezers and\\ncoherently coupled to the Rydberg state allow quantum simulations of\\nparadigmatic Hamiltonians for quantum magnetism. Previous studies have focused\\nmainly on periodic arrangements of the optical tweezers, which host various\\nspatially ordered magnetic phases. Here, we perform unbiased quantum Monte\\nCarlo simulations of the ground state of quantum Ising models for amorphous\\narrays of Rydberg atoms. These models are designed to feature well-controlled\\nlocal structural properties in the absence of long-range order. Notably, by\\ndetermining the Edwards-Anderson order parameter, we find evidence of a quantum\\nphase transition from a paramagnetic to a spin-glass phase. The magnetic\\nstructure factor indicates short-range isotropic antiferromagnetic\\ncorrelations. For the feasible sizes, the spin-overlap distribution features a\\nnontrivial structure with two broad peaks and a sizable weight at zero overlap.\\nThe comparison against results for the clean kagome lattice, which features\\nlocal structural properties similar to those of our amorphous arrays,\\nhighlights the important role of the absence of long-range structural order of\\nthe underlying array. Our findings indicate a route to experimentally implement\\nthe details of a Hamiltonian which hosts a quantum spin-glass phase.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn,cond-mat.quant-gas,cond-mat.stat-mech,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T10:41:44Z\"}"}
