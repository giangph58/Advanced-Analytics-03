Using\\nphotometry from the deep and wide Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern\\nSurvey, combined with near-IR and mid-IR data from the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky\\nSurvey and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, we successfully identified\\n382 DOGs in $\\\\sim$ 170 deg$^2$. Among them, the vast majority (376 DOGs) were\\nclassified into two subclasses: bump DOGs (132/376) and power-law (PL) DOGs\\n(244/376), which are dominated by star formation and active galactic nucleus\\n(AGN), respectively. Through the SED analysis, we found that roughly half\\n(120/244) of the PL DOGs show ``broken'' power-law SEDs. The significant red\\nslope from optical to near-IR in the SEDs of these ``broken power-law DOGs''\\n(BPL DOGs) probably reflects their large amount of dust extinction. In other\\nwords, BPL DOGs are more heavily obscured AGNs, compared to PL DOGs with\\nnon-broken power-law SEDs.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T11:11:41Z\"}"}
