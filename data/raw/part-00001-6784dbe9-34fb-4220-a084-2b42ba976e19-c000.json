Surprisingly, we find that simple\\nobject-based visual prompting -- overlaying visual cues (e.g., bounding box,\\ncircle) on images -- can significantly mitigate such hallucination; however,\\ndifferent visual prompts (VPs) vary in effectiveness. To address this, we\\npropose Black-Box Visual Prompt Engineering (BBVPE), a framework to identify\\noptimal VPs that enhance LVLM responses without needing access to model\\ninternals. Our approach employs a pool of candidate VPs and trains a router\\nmodel to dynamically select the most effective VP for a given input image. This\\nblack-box approach is model-agnostic, making it applicable to both open-source\\nand proprietary LVLMs. Evaluations on benchmarks such as POPE and CHAIR\\ndemonstrate that BBVPE effectively reduces object hallucination.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI,cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T11:58:30Z\"}"}
