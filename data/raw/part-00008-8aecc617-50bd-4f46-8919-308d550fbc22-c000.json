{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16600v1\", \"title\": \"3D-1D modelling of cranial plate heating induced by low or medium\\n  frequency magnetic fields\", \"summary\": \"Safety assessment of patients with one-dimensionally structured passive\\nimplants, like cranial plates or stents, exposed to low or medium frequency\\nmagnetic fields, like those generated in magnetic resonance imaging or magnetic\\nhyperthermia, can be challenging, because of the different length scales of the\\nimplant and the human body. Most of the methods used to estimate the heating\\ninduced near such implants neglect the presence of the metallic materials\\nwithin the body, modeling the metal as thermal seeds. To overcome this\\nlimitation, a novel numerical approach that solves three-dimensional and\\none-dimensional coupled problems is proposed. This method leads to improved\\nresults by modelling the thermal diffusion through the highly conductive\\nmetallic implants. A comparison of the proposed method predictions with\\nmeasurements performed on a cranial plate exposed to the magnetic field\\ngenerated by a gradient coil system for magnetic resonance imaging is\\npresented, showing an improved accuracy up to 25 % with respect to the method\\nbased on thermal seeds. The proposed method is finally applied to a magnetic\\nhyperthermia case study in which a patient with a cranial plate is exposed to\\nthe magnetic field generated by a collar-type magnetic hyperthermia applicator\\nfor neck tumour treatment, predicting a temperature increase in proximity of\\nthe implant that is 10 % lower than the one overestimated by relying on thermal\\nseeds.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CE\", \"categories\": \"cs.CE,cs.NA,math.NA,physics.med-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T10:29:53Z\"}"}
