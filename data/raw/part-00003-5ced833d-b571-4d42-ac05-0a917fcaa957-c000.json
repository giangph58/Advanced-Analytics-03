In many cases the third order of\\nnonlinear response is the leading and desired term. When pulse amplitudes are\\nhigh, higher orders of light-matter interaction can both distort lineshapes and\\ndynamics and provide valuable information. Here, we present a general procedure\\nto separately measure the nonlinear response orders in both TA and 2D\\nspectroscopies, using linear combinations of intensity-dependent spectra. We\\nanalyze the residual contamination and random errors and show how to choose\\noptimal intensities to minimize the total error in the extracted orders. For an\\nexperimental demonstration, we separate the nonlinear orders in the 2D\\nelectronic spectroscopy of squaraine polymers up to 11$^{th}$ order.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T16:49:52Z\"}"}
