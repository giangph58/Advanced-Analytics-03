Recently, Hogan et al. proved that $G$ can be determined from\\n$\\\\mathcal{C}_k(G)$ provided $k$ is large enough (quadratic in the number of\\nvertices of $G$). We improve this bound by showing that $k=\\\\chi(G)+1$ colours\\nsuffice, and provide examples of families of graphs for which $k=\\\\chi(G)$\\ncolours do not suffice.\\n  We then extend this result to $k$-Kempe-recolouring graphs, whose vertices\\nare again the $k$-colourings of a graph $G$ and whose edges link pairs of\\ncolourings which differ by swapping the two colours in a connected component\\ninduced by selecting those two colours. We show that $k=\\\\chi(G)+2$ colours\\nsuffice to determine $G$ in this case.\\n  Finally, we investigate the case of independent set reconfiguration, proving\\nthat in only a few trivial cases is one guaranteed to be able to determine a\\ngraph $G$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,cs.DM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T13:28:02Z\"}"}
