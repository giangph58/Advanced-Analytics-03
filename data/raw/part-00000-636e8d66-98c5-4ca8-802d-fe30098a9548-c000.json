{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13129v1\", \"title\": \"Science-T2I: Addressing Scientific Illusions in Image Synthesis\", \"summary\": \"We present a novel approach to integrating scientific knowledge into\\ngenerative models, enhancing their realism and consistency in image synthesis.\\nFirst, we introduce Science-T2I, an expert-annotated adversarial dataset\\ncomprising adversarial 20k image pairs with 9k prompts, covering wide distinct\\nscientific knowledge categories. Leveraging Science-T2I, we present SciScore,\\nan end-to-end reward model that refines the assessment of generated images\\nbased on scientific knowledge, which is achieved by augmenting both the\\nscientific comprehension and visual capabilities of pre-trained CLIP model.\\nAdditionally, based on SciScore, we propose a two-stage training framework,\\ncomprising a supervised fine-tuning phase and a masked online fine-tuning\\nphase, to incorporate scientific knowledge into existing generative models.\\nThrough comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our\\nframework in establishing new standards for evaluating the scientific realism\\nof generated content. Specifically, SciScore attains performance comparable to\\nhuman-level, demonstrating a 5% improvement similar to evaluations conducted by\\nexperienced human evaluators. Furthermore, by applying our proposed fine-tuning\\nmethod to FLUX, we achieve a performance enhancement exceeding 50% on SciScore.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:44:19Z\"}"}
