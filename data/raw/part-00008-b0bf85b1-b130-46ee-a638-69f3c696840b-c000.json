{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19932v1\", \"title\": \"Post-buckling of fiber-reinforced soft tissues\", \"summary\": \"Fiber-reinforcement is a universal feature of many biological tissues. It\\ninvolves the interplay between fiber stiffness, fiber orientation, and the\\nelastic properties of the matrix, influencing pattern formation and evolution\\nin layered tissues. Here, we investigate the deformation of a compressed film\\nbonded to a half-space, where either the film or the substrate exhibits\\nanisotropy. Within the framework of finite elasticity, we formulate nonlinear\\nincremental equations, enabling linear and weakly nonlinear analyses. These\\nanalyses yield exact bifurcation conditions and an amplitude equation for\\nsurface wrinkling. In particular, for a simple fiber-reinforced model, we show\\nthat the bifurcation can be supercritical or subcritical depending on the ratio\\nbetween the substrate and the film moduli. These findings underscore the\\npivotal role of fiber-reinforcement in shaping pattern formation in anisotropic\\ntissues and provide insights into the morphological evolution of biological\\ntissues.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:08:10Z\"}"}
