A detailed analysis of the multidimensional\\nphase space requires a large computing effort when many variants of the\\nmagnetic lattice, representing the realisation of magnetic errors or\\nconfigurations for performance optimisation, have to be considered. Dynamic\\nindicators for chaos detection have proven to be very effective in finding and\\ndistinguishing the weakly-chaotic regions of phase space where diffusion takes\\nplace and regions that remain stable over time scales in the order of multiple\\nhours of continuous operation. This paper explores the use of advanced chaos\\nindicators, including the Fast Lyapunov Indicator with Birkhoff weights and the\\nReverse Error Method, in realistic lattice models for the CERN Large Hadron\\nCollider (LHC). Their convergence, predictive power, and potential to define a\\nmagnetic lattice quality factor linked to long-term dynamic aperture are\\nassessed. The results demonstrate the efficiency of these indicators in\\nidentifying chaotic dynamics, offering valuable insights of these chaos\\nindicators for optimising accelerator lattices with reduced computational cost\\ncompared to the classical approach based on CPU-demanding long-term tracking\\ncampaigns.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.acc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.acc-ph,nlin.CD\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T08:30:15Z\"}"}
