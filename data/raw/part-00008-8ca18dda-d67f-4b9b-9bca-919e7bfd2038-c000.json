In\\nthe predictive \\\"direct annihilation\\\" regime, $m_{A'} > m_\\\\chi$, the relic\\nabundance depends on the kinetic mixing parameter, and there is a minimum value\\ncompatible with thermal freeze out. Using only electron and nuclear recoil\\ndirect detection results, we find that for complex scalar dark matter, the\\ndirect-annihilation regime is now excluded for nearly all values of $m_\\\\chi$;\\nthe only exception is the resonant annihilation regime where $m_{A'}\\\\approx 2\\nm_\\\\chi$. Direct annihilation relic targets for other representative models,\\nincluding Majorana and Pseudo-Dirac candidates, remain viable across a wide\\nrange of model parameters, but will be tested with a combination of dedicated\\naccelerator searches in the near future. In the opposite \\\"secluded\\nannihilation\\\" regime, where $m_\\\\chi > m_{A'}$, this scenario is excluded by\\ncosmic microwave background measurements for all $m_\\\\chi \\\\lesssim 30$ GeV.\\nSimilar conclusions in both the direct and secluded regimes hold for all\\nanomaly-free vector mediators that couple to the first generation of\\nelectrically-charged Standard Model particles.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,astro-ph.CO,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T17:59:59Z\"}"}
