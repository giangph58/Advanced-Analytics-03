{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19957v1\", \"title\": \"Revisiting Directed Disjoint Paths on tournaments (and relatives)\", \"summary\": \"In the Directed Disjoint Paths problem ($k$-DDP), we are given a digraph $k$\\npairs of terminals, and the goal is to find $k$ pairwise vertex-disjoint paths\\nconnecting each pair of terminals. Bang-Jensen and Thomassen [SIAM J. Discrete\\nMath. 1992] claimed that $k$-DDP is NP-complete on tournaments, and this result\\ntriggered a very active line of research about the complexity of the problem on\\ntournaments and natural superclasses. We identify a flaw in their proof, which\\nhas been acknowledged by the authors, and provide a new NP-completeness proof.\\nFrom an algorithmic point of view, Fomin and Pilipczuk [J. Comb. Theory B 2019]\\nprovided an FPT algorithm for the edge-disjoint version of the problem on\\nsemicomplete digraphs, and showed that their technique cannot work for the\\nvertex-disjoint version. We overcome this obstacle by showing that the version\\nof $k$-DDP where we allow congestion $c$ on the vertices is FPT on semicomplete\\ndigraphs provided that $c$ is greater than $k/2$. This is based on a quite\\nelaborate irrelevant vertex argument inspired by the edge-disjoint version, and\\nwe show that our choice of $c$ is best possible for this technique, with a\\ncounterexample with no irrelevant vertices when $c \\\\leq k/2$. We also prove\\nthat $k$-DDP on digraphs that can be partitioned into $h$ semicomplete digraphs\\nis $W[1]$-hard parameterized by $k+h$, which shows that the XP algorithm\\npresented by Chudnovsky, Scott, and Seymour [J. Comb. Theory B 2019] is\\nessentially optimal.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:30:52Z\"}"}
