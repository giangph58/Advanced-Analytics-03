{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11353v1\", \"title\": \"An Adaptive Dropout Approach for High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization\", \"summary\": \"Bayesian optimization (BO) is a widely used algorithm for solving expensive\\nblack-box optimization problems. However, its performance decreases\\nsignificantly on high-dimensional problems due to the inherent\\nhigh-dimensionality of the acquisition function. In the proposed algorithm, we\\nadaptively dropout the variables of the acquisition function along the\\niterations. By gradually reducing the dimension of the acquisition function,\\nthe proposed approach has less and less difficulty to optimize the acquisition\\nfunction. Numerical experiments demonstrate that AdaDropout effectively tackle\\nhigh-dimensional challenges and improve solution quality where standard\\nBayesian optimization methods often struggle. Moreover, it achieves superior\\nresults when compared with state-of-the-art high-dimensional Bayesian\\noptimization approaches. This work provides a simple yet efficient solution for\\nhigh-dimensional expensive optimization.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:23:25Z\"}"}
