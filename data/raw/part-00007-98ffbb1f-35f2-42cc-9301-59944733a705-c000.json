{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24303v1\", \"title\": \"Intersection of linear and multi-twisted codes with applications\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we derive a formula for constructing a generator matrix for\\nthe intersection of any pair of linear codes over a finite field. Consequently,\\nwe establish a condition under which a linear code has a trivial intersection\\nwith another linear code (or its Galois dual). Furthermore, we provide a\\ncondition for reversibility and propose a generator matrix formula for the\\nlargest reversible subcode of any linear code. We then focus on the\\ncomprehensive class of multi-twisted (MT) codes, which are naturally and more\\neffectively represented using generator polynomial matrices (GPMs). We prove\\nthat the reversed code of an MT code remains MT and derive an explicit formula\\nfor its GPM. Additionally, we examine the intersection of a pair of MT codes,\\npossibly with different shift constants, and demonstrate that this intersection\\nis not necessarily MT. However, when the intersection has an MT structure, we\\ndetermine the corresponding shift constants. We also establish a GPM formula\\nfor the intersection of a pair of MT codes with the same shift constants. This\\nresult enables us to derive a GPM formula for the intersection of an MT code\\nand the Galois dual of another MT code. Finally, we examine conditions for\\nvarious properties on MT codes. Perhaps most importantly, the necessary and\\nsufficient conditions for an MT code to be Galois self-orthogonal, Galois\\ndual-containing, Galois linear complementary dual (LCD), or reversible.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:48:27Z\"}"}
