To address this gap,\\nwe propose the Mean-Field LLM (MF-LLM) framework, which explicitly models the\\nfeedback loop between micro-level decisions and macro-level population. MF-LLM\\nalternates between two models: a policy model that generates individual actions\\nbased on personal states and group-level information, and a mean field model\\nthat updates the population distribution from the latest individual decisions.\\nTogether, they produce rollouts that simulate the evolving trajectories of\\ncollective decision-making. To better match real-world data, we introduce\\nIB-Tune, a fine-tuning method for LLMs grounded in the information bottleneck\\nprinciple, which maximizes the relevance of population distributions to future\\nactions while minimizing redundancy with historical data. We evaluate MF-LLM on\\na real-world social dataset, where it reduces KL divergence to human population\\ndistributions by 47 percent over non-mean-field baselines, and enables accurate\\ntrend forecasting and intervention planning. It generalizes across seven\\ndomains and four LLM backbones, providing a scalable foundation for\\nhigh-fidelity social simulation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MA\", \"categories\": \"cs.MA,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T12:41:51Z\"}"}
