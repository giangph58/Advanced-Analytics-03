FluxCT V2.0 focuses on enhancing\\nfunctionality, user experience, and data processing capabilities. We resolved\\nexisting issues to allow for an extended user base, removed known bugs, and\\nextended the tool to any TESS pixel file, allowing the user to search any TESS\\npoint object. A batch code for TESS is now available on the companion GitHub.\\nAdditional output parameters, such as amplitude dilution and a magnitude cut,\\nhave been added to the tool, allowing users more freedom to analyze the\\npossible effects of target sources.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T06:58:45Z\"}"}
