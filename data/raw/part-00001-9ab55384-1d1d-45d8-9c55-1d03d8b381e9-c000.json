However, HAT research remains fragmented,\\noften focusing on isolated team development phases or specific challenges like\\ntrust calibration while overlooking the real-world need for adaptability.\\nAddressing these gaps, a process dynamics perspective is adopted to\\nsystematically review HAT using the T$^4$ framework: Team Formation, Task and\\nRole Development, Team Development, and Team Improvement. Each phase is\\nexamined in terms of its goals, actions, and evaluation metrics, emphasizing\\nthe co-evolution of task and team dynamics. Special focus is given to the\\nsecond and third phases, highlighting key factors such as team roles, shared\\nmental model, and backup behaviors. This holistic perspective identifies future\\nresearch directions for advancing long-term adaptive HAT.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T06:58:59Z\"}"}
