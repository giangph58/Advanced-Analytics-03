A natural strategy is to take the flat\\nspace limit of the celebrated AdS$_4$/CFT$_3$ correspondence, which relates\\nM-theory in AdS$_4 \\\\times$S$^7$ to a certain superconformal Chern-Simons-matter\\ntheory known as the ABJM theory. In this limit, the boundary of AdS$_4$ becomes\\nnull infinity and the ABJM theory should exhibit an emergent superconformal\\nCarrollian symmetry. We investigate this possiblity by matching the Carrollian\\nlimit of ABJM correlators with four-dimensional supergravity amplitudes that\\narise from taking the flat space limit of AdS$_4 \\\\times$S$^7$ and reducing\\nalong the S$^7$. We also present a general analysis of three-dimensional\\nsuperconformal Carrollian symmetry.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T15:02:58Z\"}"}
