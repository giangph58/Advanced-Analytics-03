{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21305v1\", \"title\": \"Virtual Element Method Applied to Two Dimensional Axisymmetric Elastic\\n  Problems\", \"summary\": \"This work presents a Virtual Element Method (VEM) formulation tailored for\\ntwo-dimensional axisymmetric problems in linear elasticity. By exploiting the\\nrotational symmetry of the geometry and loading conditions, the problem is\\nreduced to a meridional cross-section, where all fields depend only on the\\nradial and axial coordinates. The method incorporates the radial weight $r$ in\\nboth the weak formulation and the interpolation estimates to remain consistent\\nwith the physical volume measure of cylindrical coordinates. A projection\\noperator onto constant strain fields is constructed via boundary integrals, and\\na volumetric correction term is introduced to account for the divergence of the\\nstress field arising from axisymmetry. The stabilization term is designed to\\nact only on the kernel of the projection and is implemented using a\\nboundary-based formulation that guarantees stability without affecting\\npolynomial consistency. Furthermore, an a priori interpolation error estimate\\nis established in a weighted Sobolev space, showing optimal convergence rates.\\nThe implementation is validated through patch tests that demonstrate the\\naccuracy, consistency, and robustness of the proposed approach.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T04:26:50Z\"}"}
