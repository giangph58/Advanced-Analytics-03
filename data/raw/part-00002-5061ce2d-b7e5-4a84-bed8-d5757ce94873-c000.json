{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04324v1\", \"title\": \"Towards Federated Digital Twin Platforms\", \"summary\": \"Digital Twin (DT) technology has become rather popular in recent years,\\npromising to optimize production processes, manage the operation of\\ncyber-physical systems, with an impact spanning across multiple application\\ndomains (e.g., manufacturing, robotics, space etc.). DTs can include different\\nkinds of assets, e.g., models, data, which could potentially be reused across\\nDT projects by multiple users, directly affecting development costs, as well as\\nenabling collaboration and further development of these assets. To provide user\\nsupport for these purposes, dedicated DT frameworks and platforms are required,\\nthat take into account user needs, providing the infrastructure and building\\nblocks for DT development and management. In this demo paper, we show how the\\nDT as a Service (DTaaS) platform has been extended to enable a federated\\napproach to DT development and management, that allows multiple users across\\nmultiple instances of DTaaS to discover, reuse, reconfigure, and modify\\nexisting DT assets.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T11:13:15Z\"}"}
