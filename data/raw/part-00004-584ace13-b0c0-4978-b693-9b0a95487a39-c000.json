In this work, we investigate electronic and\\nthermoelectric transport properties of a Kagome magnet ErMn$_6$Sn$_6$, a\\ncompound showing an incommensurate antiferromagnetic phase followed by a\\nferrimagnetic phase transition upon cooling. We show that in the\\nantiferromagnetic phase ErMn$_6$Sn$_6$ exhibits both topological Nernst effect\\nand anomalous Nernst effect, analogous to the electric Hall effects, with the\\nNernst coefficient reaching 1.71 uV/K at 300 K and 3 T. This value surpasses\\nthat of most of previously reported state-of-the-art canted antiferromagnetic\\nmaterials and is comparable to recently reported other members of RMn$_6$Sn$_6$\\n(R = rare-earth, Y, Lu, Sc) compounds, which makes ErMn$_6$Sn$_6$ a promising\\ncandidate for advancing the development of Nernst effect-based thermoelectric\\ndevices.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T14:14:05Z\"}"}
