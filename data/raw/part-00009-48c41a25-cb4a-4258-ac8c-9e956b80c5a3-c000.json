We show that the $n$-valued multiplication in the group\\n$\\\\mathbb{G}_n$ is realized in terms of the eigenvalues of the Kronecker sum of\\ncompanion Frobenius matrices for polynomials of the form $t^n - x$ in the\\nvariable $t$. The notion of a Wendt $(x, y, z)$-matrix is introduced. When $x =\\n(-1)^n$, $y = z = 1$, one recovers the classical Wendt matrix, whose\\ndeterminant is used in number theory in connection with Fermat's Last Theorem.\\nIt is shown that for each positive integer $n$, the polynomial $p_n$ is given\\nby the determinant of a Wendt $(x, y, z)$-matrix. Iterations of the $n$-valued\\nmultiplication in the group $\\\\mathbb{G}_n$ lead to polynomials $p_n(z; x_1,\\n\\\\dots, x_m)$. We prove the irreducibility of the polynomial $p_n(z; x_1, \\\\dots,\\nx_m)$ over various fields. For each $n$, we introduce the notion of classes of\\nsymmetric $n$-algebraic $n$-valued groups. The group $\\\\mathbb{G}_n$ belongs to\\none of these classes. For $n = 2, 3$, a description of the universal objects of\\nthese classes is obtained.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GR\", \"categories\": \"math.GR,math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T10:08:03Z\"}"}
