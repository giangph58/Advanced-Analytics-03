We work with bounded,\\nmeasurable kernels and provide the corresponding $L^{\\\\infty}_{loc} \\\\rightarrow\\nC^{0,\\\\alpha}_{loc}$ De Giorgi-Nash-Moser theory for the equation via a delicate\\nanalysis of the set of singularity/degeneracy in a geometry dictated by the\\nsolution itself and a careful analysis of far-off effects. In particular, our\\nresults are in the spirit of interior regularity, requiring the equation to\\nhold only locally, and thus are new even for positive solutions of the equation\\nwith constant coefficients.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T09:27:11Z\"}"}
