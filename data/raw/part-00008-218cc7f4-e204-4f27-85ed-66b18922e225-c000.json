These methods are the\\nthree-particle relativistic field theory (RFT) formalism, the two-body\\nLippmann-Schwinger (LS) equation with chiral effective field theory potentials,\\nand the two-particle relativistic framework proposed by Baiao Raposo and Hansen\\n(BRH approach). In a simplified single-channel setting, we derive the\\nconditions under which the infinite-volume integral equations from the RFT and\\nBRH approaches reduce to the LS form. We present numerical examples showing\\nthat differences between these methods can be largely removed by adjusting\\nshort-range couplings. We also address a number of technical issues in the RFT\\napproach.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,hep-lat,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T17:57:22Z\"}"}
