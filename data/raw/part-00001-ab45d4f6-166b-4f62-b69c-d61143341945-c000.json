{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12964v1\", \"title\": \"Lee Yang edge singularities of QCD in association with Roberge-Weiss\\n  phase transition and chiral phase transition\", \"summary\": \"We study the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phase transitions in the complex\\nchemical potential plane in the framework of Dyson-Schwinger equation approach,\\nin the presence of a constant gluonic background field that represents\\nconfining dynamics. We solve the quark gap equation and the background field\\nequation self consistently, which allows us to directly explore the confinement\\nphase transition and furthermore, evaluate the impact of the back-coupling of\\nconfinement on chiral symmetry breaking. Moreover, within such a coupled\\nframework towards the complex chemical potential region, we demonstrate the\\nemergence of Roberge-Weiss (RW) symmetry and investigate the trajectory of\\nLee-Yang edge singularities (LYES). Our analysis reveals that the LYES scaling\\nbehavior is similar to our previous findings without the background field\\ncondensate. However, a significant difference from our earlier work is that the\\ntrajectory of LYES terminates when the imaginary part of the singularity\\nbecomes $1/3 \\\\, \\\\pi T$. We elaborate that this cut-off behavior is caused by\\nthe RW symmetry that is symmetric to the imaginary chemical potential\\n$\\\\mu_i=1/3 \\\\, \\\\pi T$.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-th,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T14:18:14Z\"}"}
