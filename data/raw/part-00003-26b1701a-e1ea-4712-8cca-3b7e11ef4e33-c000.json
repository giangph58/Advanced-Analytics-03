Besides their selective excitation,\\nalso the detection of such short-wavelength spin waves remains a challenge of\\ncurrent research and technology. Here, we probe the amplitude and wave vector\\nof magnons by means of quasi-elastic resonant soft-X-ray scattering. This\\nMagnon Momentum Microscopy (MMM) can access magnons directly in momentum space\\nwith remarkable sensitivity and high photon efficiency up to THz frequencies\\nand down to few-nanometre wavelengths. The two-dimensional information obtained\\nby this light-scattering-based technique is especially valuable for studying\\nthe nonlinear interactions of exchange-dominated magnons within technologically\\nrelevant thin-film samples. In doing so, we uncover a rich variety of deeply\\nnonlinear magnon interactions, highlighting their potential for applications in\\nnovel computing schemes. With its intrinsic element-selectivity and ability to\\nprobe also buried layers, soft-X-ray MMM has the potential to establish itself\\nas an advanced tool for ultrabroadband studies of short-wavelength magnonics.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:31:15Z\"}"}
