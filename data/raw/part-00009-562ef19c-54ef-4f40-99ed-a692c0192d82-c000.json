Our work explores whether such models can be\\nused to finetune a symbolic music generation system with reinforcement\\nlearning, and what effect this has on the system outputs. To test this, we use\\ngroup relative policy optimization to finetune a piano MIDI model with Meta\\nAudiobox Aesthetics ratings of audio-rendered outputs as the reward. We find\\nthat this optimization has effects on multiple low-level features of the\\ngenerated outputs, and improves the average subjective ratings in a preliminary\\nlistening study with $14$ participants. We also find that over-optimization\\ndramatically reduces diversity of model outputs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SD\", \"categories\": \"cs.SD\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T16:02:25Z\"}"}
