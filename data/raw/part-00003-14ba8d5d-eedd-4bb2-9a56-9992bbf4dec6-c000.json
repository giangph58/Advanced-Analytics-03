{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21389v1\", \"title\": \"Enhanced Semi-Supervised Stamping Process Monitoring with\\n  Physically-Informed Feature Extraction\", \"summary\": \"In tackling frequent anomalies in stamping processes, this study introduces a\\nnovel semi-supervised in-process anomaly monitoring framework, utilizing\\naccelerometer signals and physics information, to capture the process anomaly\\neffectively. The proposed framework facilitates the construction of a\\nmonitoring model with imbalanced sample distribution, which enables in-process\\ncondition monitoring in real-time to prevent batch anomalies, which helps to\\nreduce batch defects risk and enhance production yield. Firstly, to effectively\\ncapture key features from raw data containing redundant information, a hybrid\\nfeature extraction algorithm is proposed to utilize data-driven methods and\\nphysical mechanisms simultaneously. Secondly, to address the challenge brought\\nby imbalanced sample distribution, a semi-supervised anomaly detection model is\\nestablished, which merely employs normal samples to build a golden baseline\\nmodel, and a novel deviation score is proposed to quantify the anomaly level of\\neach online stamping stroke. The effectiveness of the proposed feature\\nextraction method is validated with various classification algorithms. A\\nreal-world in-process dataset from stamping manufacturing workshop is employed\\nto illustrate the superiority of proposed semi-supervised framework with\\nenhance performance for process anomaly monitoring.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T07:42:19Z\"}"}
