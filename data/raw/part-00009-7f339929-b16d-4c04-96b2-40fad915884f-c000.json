We hypothesize that desk movement\\nis influenced not only by classroom floor type but also by the physical\\ncharacteristics of students, such as height and age. Furthermore, we explore\\nhow the subject taught in the classroom (e.g., Science vs. Modern Foreign\\nLanguages) contributes to desk dynamics. Utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation\\nmodel, we quantitatively analyse the forces at play in these phenomena. This\\nresearch reveals that desks on carpeted floors are particularly prone to\\nmovement, especially in science classrooms with taller and younger students.\\nWhile the results may seem trivial, they provide critical insights into the\\nmechanics of classroom furniture behaviour and its implications for educational\\npractices. The paper offers compelling evidence that classroom furniture has a\\nmind of its own or, at the very least, a subtle gravitational pull towards the\\nfront of the room.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ed-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ed-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:03:53Z\"}"}
