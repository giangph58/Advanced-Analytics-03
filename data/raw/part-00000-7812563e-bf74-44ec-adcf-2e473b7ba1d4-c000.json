We achieve\\nultra-high quality factors by preparing a highly transparent and strongly\\ndispersive medium within a resonator, causing a reduction in the group velocity\\nthat leads to a nearly three order of magnitude increase in the quality factor.\\nWe implement this via spectral hole burning in erbium-doped thin-film lithium\\nniobate microring resonators, and show Q-factors exceeding $10^8$.\\nAdditionally, we show that the interplay between the spectrally narrowed\\nresonance and the broader bare resonance produces a Fano lineshape, which we\\ndynamically control via electro-optic tuning. Finally, we present a theoretical\\nmodel for our experimentally observed resonator linewidths, which are not\\nwell-described by the standard Bloch equations. Our results show a dramatic\\nreduction in the erbium dephasing rate under a strong optical drive, leading to\\nmuch narrower linewidths than would otherwise be expected given the large\\ncirculating intensity in the resonator.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T04:10:44Z\"}"}
