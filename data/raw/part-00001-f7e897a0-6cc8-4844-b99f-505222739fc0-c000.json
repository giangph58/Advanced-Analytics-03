{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02491v1\", \"title\": \"ToMCCA-3: A realistic 3-body coalescence model\", \"summary\": \"The formation of light nuclei in high-energy collisions provides valuable\\ninsights into the underlying dynamics of the strong interaction and the\\nstructure of the particle-emitting source. Understanding this process is\\ncrucial not only for nuclear physics but also for astrophysical studies, where\\nthe production of rare antinuclei could serve as a probe for new physics. This\\nwork presents a three-body coalescence model based on the Wigner function\\nformalism, offering a refined description of light-nucleus production. By\\nincorporating realistic two- and three-body nuclear interaction potentials\\nconstrained by modern scattering and femtoscopic correlation data, our approach\\nimproves on traditional coalescence models. The framework is validated using\\nevent generators applied to proton-proton collisions at $\\\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV to\\npredict the momentum spectra of light (anti) nuclear nuclei with mass number\\n$A=3$, which are then compared with the experimental data from ALICE. Our\\nresults demonstrate the sensitivity of light nucleus yields to the choice of\\nnuclear wave functions, emphasizing the importance of an accurate description\\nof the coalescence process. This model lays the foundation for the extension of\\ncoalescence studies of $A=3$ light nuclei to a wider range of collision systems\\nand energies.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T11:14:38Z\"}"}
