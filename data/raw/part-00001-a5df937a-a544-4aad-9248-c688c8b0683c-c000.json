The factors\\nconsidered include lagged imbalance values, observations of renewable energy\\nsources (RES) generation and consumption, and forecasts for RES generation and\\nconsumption. The study analyzes the distribution of system imbalance in\\nrelation to these variables. Additionally, an HGBR machine-learning model is\\nemployed to assess the predictability of imbalances and the explanatory power\\nof the input variables studied.\\n  The results indicate no clear correlation between RES generation or\\nconsumption and the observed imbalances. However, it is possible to predict the\\nimbalance adequately using forecasts available a few hours before real-time,\\nalong with the lagged values of the imbalance. Predicting the imbalance a day\\nin advance proves to be complex with the variables examined; however, the\\nextreme quantiles of the imbalance used for reserve sizing and contracting can\\nbe predicted with sufficient accuracy.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:53:47Z\"}"}
