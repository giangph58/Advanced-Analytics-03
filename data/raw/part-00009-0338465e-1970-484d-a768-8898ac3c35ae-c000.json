{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04306v1\", \"title\": \"MoDE: Mixture of Diffusion Experts for Any Occluded Face Recognition\", \"summary\": \"With the continuous impact of epidemics, people have become accustomed to\\nwearing masks. However, most current occluded face recognition (OFR) algorithms\\nlack prior knowledge of occlusions, resulting in poor performance when dealing\\nwith occluded faces of varying types and severity in reality. Recognizing\\noccluded faces is still a significant challenge, which greatly affects the\\nconvenience of people's daily lives. In this paper, we propose an\\nidentity-gated mixture of diffusion experts (MoDE) for OFR. Each\\ndiffusion-based generative expert estimates one possible complete image for\\noccluded faces. Considering the random sampling process of the diffusion model,\\nwhich introduces inevitable differences and variations between the inpainted\\nfaces and the real ones. To ensemble effective information from\\nmulti-reconstructed faces, we introduce an identity-gating network to evaluate\\nthe contribution of each reconstructed face to the identity and adaptively\\nintegrate the predictions in the decision space. Moreover, our MoDE is a\\nplug-and-play module for most existing face recognition models. Extensive\\nexperiments on three public face datasets and two datasets in the wild validate\\nour advanced performance for various occlusions in comparison with the\\ncompeting methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T10:29:39Z\"}"}
