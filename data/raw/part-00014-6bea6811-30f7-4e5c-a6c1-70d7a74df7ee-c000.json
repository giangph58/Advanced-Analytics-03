{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11979v1\", \"title\": \"On the Regularity of Random 2-SAT and 3-SAT\", \"summary\": \"We consider the random $k$-SAT problem with $n$ variables, $m=m(n)$ clauses,\\nand clause density $\\\\alpha=\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}m/n$ for $k=2,3$. It is known that\\nif $\\\\alpha$ is small enough, then the random $k$-SAT problem admits a solution\\nwith high probability, which we interpret as the problem being\\nunder-constrained. In this paper, we quantify exactly how under-constrained the\\nrandom $k$-SAT problems are by determining their degrees of freedom, which we\\ndefine as the threshold for the number of variables we can fix to an arbitrary\\nvalue before the problem no longer is solvable with high probability. We show\\nthat the random $2$-SAT and $3$-SAT problems have $n/m^{1/2}$ and $n/m^{1/3}$\\ndegrees of freedom, respectively. Our main result is an explicit computation of\\nthe corresponding threshold functions. Our result shows that the threshold\\nfunction for the random $2$-SAT problem is regular, while it is non-regular for\\nthe random $3$-SAT problem. By regular, we mean continuous and analytic on the\\ninterior of its support. This result shows that the random $3$-SAT problem is\\nmore sensitive to small changes in the clause density $\\\\alpha$ than the random\\n$2$-SAT problem.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,cs.DM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T11:17:56Z\"}"}
