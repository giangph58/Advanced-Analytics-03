{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07963v1\", \"title\": \"PixelFlow: Pixel-Space Generative Models with Flow\", \"summary\": \"We present PixelFlow, a family of image generation models that operate\\ndirectly in the raw pixel space, in contrast to the predominant latent-space\\nmodels. This approach simplifies the image generation process by eliminating\\nthe need for a pre-trained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and enabling the whole\\nmodel end-to-end trainable. Through efficient cascade flow modeling, PixelFlow\\nachieves affordable computation cost in pixel space. It achieves an FID of 1.98\\non 256$\\\\times$256 ImageNet class-conditional image generation benchmark. The\\nqualitative text-to-image results demonstrate that PixelFlow excels in image\\nquality, artistry, and semantic control. We hope this new paradigm will inspire\\nand open up new opportunities for next-generation visual generation models.\\nCode and models are available at https://github.com/ShoufaChen/PixelFlow.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:59:56Z\"}"}
