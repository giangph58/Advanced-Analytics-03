This gathering continues a long standing tradition in the\\ndatabase community, dating back to the late 1980s, in which researchers meet\\nroughly every five years to produce a forward looking report.\\n  This report summarizes the key takeaways from our discussions. We begin with\\na retrospective on the academic, open source, and commercial successes of the\\ncommunity over the past five years. We then turn to future opportunities, with\\na focus on core data systems, particularly in the context of cloud computing\\nand emerging hardware, as well as on the growing impact of data science, data\\ngovernance, and generative AI.\\n  This document is not intended as an exhaustive survey of all technical\\nchallenges or industry innovations in the field. Rather, it reflects the\\nperspectives of senior community members on the most pressing challenges and\\npromising opportunities ahead.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DB\", \"categories\": \"cs.DB\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:57:46Z\"}"}
