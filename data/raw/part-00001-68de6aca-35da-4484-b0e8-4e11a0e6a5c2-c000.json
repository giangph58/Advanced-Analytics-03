{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06887v1\", \"title\": \"Harvesting Fermionic Field Entanglement in Schwarzschild Spacetime\", \"summary\": \"We explore entanglement harvesting using two Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors\\nlinearly coupled to the scalar density\\n  of a massless spin-1/2 field in 1+1 Schwarzschild spacetime. We consider\\ndifferent vacua, including the Boulware, Hartle Hawking-Israel (HHI), and Unruh\\nvacua, and investigate various configurations depending on the choice of 2-bein\\nin the\\n  interaction Hamiltonian. We find that the transition rate of the static UDW\\ndetector exhibits the expected Planckian\\n  behavior in the HHI state, while the Unruh state leads to the Helmholtz free\\nenergy density of a bosonic or fermionic\\n  thermal bath corresponding to the static or conformal 2-bein respectively.\\nFurther, we observe that the anti-Hawking\\n  effect enhances the entanglement between the two detectors while the\\ngravitational redshift and Hawking radiation\\n  decreases it. In particular, due to the presence of the anti-Hawking effect,\\nthe mutual information and concurrence\\n  near the event horizon can be non-zero even for static detectors with static\\n2-bein, which is in contrast with the case\\n  of scalar field. We also show that the near-horizon entanglement properties\\nfor static detectors in the HHI state have\\n  similar behaviour with those in Minkowski vacua for uniformly accelerated\\ndetectors in Rindler spacetime. Conclusions\\n  are discussed.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:49:39Z\"}"}
