In this Letter we theoretically study the effect of the\\nthermal noise on torque-driven steering of magnetic nanohelices. Using a\\ncombination of numerical and analytical methods, we demonstrate that\\nsurprisingly a weak thermal noise can substantially disrupt the orientation and\\nrotation of the nanohelix, severely impeding its propulsion. The results of\\nLangevin simulations are in excellent agreement with the numerical solution of\\nthe Fokker-Planck equation and the analytical effective field approximation.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:37:39Z\"}"}
