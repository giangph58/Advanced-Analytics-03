In this work, we study the effectiveness of\\nReinforcement Learning (RL) for reducing convective heat transfer in the 2D\\nRayleigh-B\\\\'enard Convection (RBC) system under increasing turbulence. We\\ninvestigate the generalizability of control across varying initial conditions\\nand turbulence levels and introduce a reward shaping technique to accelerate\\nthe training. RL agents trained via single-agent Proximal Policy Optimization\\n(PPO) are compared to linear proportional derivative (PD) controllers from\\nclassical control theory. The RL agents reduced convection, measured by the\\nNusselt Number, by up to 33% in moderately turbulent systems and 10% in highly\\nturbulent settings, clearly outperforming PD control in all settings. The\\nagents showed strong generalization performance across different initial\\nconditions and to a significant extent, generalized to higher degrees of\\nturbulence. The reward shaping improved sample efficiency and consistently\\nstabilized the Nusselt Number to higher turbulence levels.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T11:51:59Z\"}"}
