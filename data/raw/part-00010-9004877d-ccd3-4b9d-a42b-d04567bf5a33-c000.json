{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21608v1\", \"title\": \"No Evidence of Anomalous Diffusion in Yukawa Crystals\", \"summary\": \"Diffusion in Yukawa crystals is stochastic due to the thermally activated\\nformation of vacancy-interstitial pairs, which have poor statistics in\\nsimulations. This makes it difficult to argue if Yukawa crystals exhibit normal\\ndiffusion, or if they could be subdiffusive or superdiffusive. To resolve this,\\nwe run a long molecular dynamics simulation of an idealized Yukawa crystal for\\na billion timesteps. We find no evidence of anomalous diffusion in the pure\\ncrystal, but also caution readers against overinterpreting this result as real\\ncrystals have complicated structures including grains and defects.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph,astro-ph.SR,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T13:08:01Z\"}"}
