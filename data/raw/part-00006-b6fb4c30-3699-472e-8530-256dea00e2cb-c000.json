Thus,\\noffline-trained segmentation models may lead to catastrophic forgetting of\\npreviously seen classes. Class-incremental learning (CIL) is designed to\\naddress the problem of catastrophic forgetting. While point clouds are common,\\nwe observe high similarity and unclear boundaries between different classes.\\nMeanwhile, they are known to be imbalanced in class distribution. These lead to\\nissues including misclassification between similar classes and the long-tail\\nproblem, which have not been adequately addressed in previous CIL methods. We\\nthus propose ProtoGuard and PROPEL (Progressive Refinement Of PsEudo-Labels).\\nIn the base-class training phase, ProtoGuard maintains geometric and semantic\\nprototypes for each class, which are combined into prototype features using an\\nattention mechanism. In the novel-class training phase, PROPEL inherits the\\nbase feature extractor and classifier, guiding pseudo-label propagation and\\nupdates based on density distribution and semantic similarity. Extensive\\nexperiments show that our approach achieves remarkable results on both the\\nS3DIS and ScanNet datasets, improving the mIoU of 3D point cloud segmentation\\nby a maximum of 20.39% under the 5-step CIL scenario on S3DIS.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:58:04Z\"}"}
