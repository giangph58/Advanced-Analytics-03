In contrast,\\nsmaller models (SMs), while less powerful, can be more efficient and tailored\\nto specific domains. In this position paper, we argue that taking a\\ncollaborative approach, where large and small models work synergistically, can\\naccelerate the adaptation of LLMs to private domains and unlock new potential\\nin AI. We explore various strategies for model collaboration and identify\\npotential challenges and opportunities. Building upon this, we advocate for\\nindustry-driven research that prioritizes multi-objective benchmarks on\\nreal-world private datasets and applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T10:24:35Z\"}"}
