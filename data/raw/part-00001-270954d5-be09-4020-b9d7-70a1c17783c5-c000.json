These images, the\\nprecursors to modern satellite imagery, represent an extraordinary visual\\nrecord of the environmental and social upheavals of the 20th Century. However,\\nmost of these images currently languish in physical archives where retrieval is\\ndifficult and costly. Digitization could revolutionize access, but manual\\nscanning is slow and expensive. Here, we describe and validate a novel\\nrobot-assisted pipeline that increases worker productivity in scanning 30-fold,\\napplied at scale to digitize an archive of 1.7 million historical aerial\\nphotographs from 65 countries.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.SY,econ.GN,eess.SY,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:23:05Z\"}"}
