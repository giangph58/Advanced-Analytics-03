The\\nresults reveal significant crosstalk effects between several parameters, which\\nare traced back to specific optical components in the system. To address these\\nissues and improve accuracy, a mathematical framework for crosstalk mitigation\\nbased on Taylor series expansions is developed. The mitigation method reduces\\nmeasurement deviations significantly by up to one order of magnitude. This work\\nprovides insights into the origins and mitigation of crosstalk effects in\\noptical measurement systems, particularly relevant for high-accuracy\\napplications.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T09:21:45Z\"}"}
