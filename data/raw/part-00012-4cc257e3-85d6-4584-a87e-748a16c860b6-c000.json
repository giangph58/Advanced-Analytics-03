In 2003, A. Bezdek asked whether the same statement holds\\nif one is required to cover only the annulus obtained from $K$ by removing a\\nhomothetic copy contained within. He showed that if $K$ is the unit square,\\nthen saving width in a plank covering is not possible, provided that the\\nhomothety factor is sufficiently small. White and Wisewell in 2006\\ncharacterized polygons that possess this property. We generalize their\\nconstructive result by showing that if $K$ is a convex disc or a convex body in\\n3-space that is spiky in a minimal width direction, then for every $\\\\varepsilon\\n\\\\in (0,1)$ it is possible to cut a homothetic copy $\\\\varepsilon K$ from the\\ninterior of $K$ so that the remaining annulus can be covered by planks whose\\ntotal width is strictly less than $w(K)$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.MG\", \"categories\": \"math.MG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:51:26Z\"}"}
