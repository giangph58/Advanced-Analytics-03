We consider the $K$-group of equivariant coherent\\nsheaves on the toric Calabi-Yau 3-orbifold with support bounded in a direction,\\nand prove that it is isomorphic to a certain integral relative first homology\\ngroup of the equivariant mirror curve. We establish a correspondence between\\nall-genus equivariant descendant Gromov-Witten invariants with $K$-theoretic\\nframings and oscillatory integrals (Laplace transforms) of the\\nChekhov-Eynard-Orantin topological recursion invariants along relative 1-cycles\\non the equivariant mirror curve. Our genus-zero correspondence is an\\nequivariant Hodge-theoretic mirror symmetry with integral structures. In the\\nnon-equivariant setting, we prove a conjecture of Hosono which equates central\\ncharges of compactly supported coherent sheaves with period integrals of\\nintegral 3-cycles on the Hori-Vafa mirror 3-fold.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T08:27:29Z\"}"}
