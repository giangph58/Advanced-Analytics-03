In the last few\\nyears, asteroseismology has enabled the measurement of strong magnetic fields\\n$10^4$--$10^6\\\\,\\\\mathrm{G}$ in the cores of dozens of red giants, and is the\\nonly known way to directly measure internal stellar magnetic fields. However,\\ncurrent data are still interpreted assuming that these fields are too weak or\\ntoo axisymmetric to affect the orientation of the pulsations (i.e., make the\\npulsations ``oblique''), rendering stronger field strengths beyond the reach of\\nexisting asteroseismic searches. We show that, even when an oblique pulsator is\\nalso stochastic (such as in a red giant with a strong non-axisymmetric magnetic\\nfield), geometric effects will cause the signal to contain frequency components\\nwhich remain in perfect relative phase with each other. This perfect phase\\nrelationship persists even over timescales in which stochasticity erases\\nabsolute phase information. This perfect relative coherence is a distinctive\\nobservational signature of oblique pulsation that does not require a model for\\nmode frequencies to search for. However, due to its dependence on phase, this\\neffect will not be evident in the power spectral density alone, and phase\\ninformation should be retained in order to detect it. Coherence-based searches\\nfor oblique pulsations may pave the way to measurements of magnetic fields of\\ncurrently inaccessible strengths in red giants, as well as some main-sequence\\nand compact pulsators.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T04:27:57Z\"}"}
