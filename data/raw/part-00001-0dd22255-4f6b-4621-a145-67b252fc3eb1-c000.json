For linear\\nautonomous ODEs, the discretized solution can be represented by a product of\\nmatrix exponentials. The proposed algorithm approximates the matrix exponential\\nby the diagonal Pad\\\\'e approximation, which is then encoded into a large,\\nblock-sparse linear system and solved via quantum linear system algorithms\\n(QLSA). The detailed quantum circuit is given based on quantum oracle access to\\nthe matrix, the inhomogeneous term, and the initial state. The complexity of\\nthe proposed algorithm is analyzed. Compared to the method based on Taylor\\napproximation, which approximates the matrix exponential using a $k$-th order\\nTaylor series, the proposed algorithm improves the approximation order $k$ from\\ntwo perspectives: 1) the explicit complexity dependency on $k$ is improved, and\\n2) a smaller $k$ suffices for the same precision. Numerical experiments\\ndemonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm comparing to other related\\nalgorithms.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:54:27Z\"}"}
