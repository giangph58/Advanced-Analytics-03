{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07941v1\", \"title\": \"Quantum error correction via multi-particle discrete-time quantum walk\", \"summary\": \"We propose a scheme of quantum error correction that employs a multi-particle\\nquantum walk defined on nested squares, each hosting a single particle. In this\\nmodel, each particle moves within its own distinct square through iterations of\\nthree discrete-time steps. First, a particle updates its two-level internal\\n{\\\\it coin} state. Next, it either moves to an adjacent vertex or stays put,\\ndepending on the outcome. Finally, it interacts with another particle if these\\nparticles arrive at the nearest-neighbor vertices of the two adjacent squares,\\nacquiring a phase factor of $-1$. Because a single particle represents a\\nthree-qubit state through its position and coin state, Shor's nine-qubit code\\nis implemented using only three particles, with two additional particles for\\nsyndrome measurement. Furthermore, by exploiting gauge symmetry, our scheme\\nachieves redundant encoding, error correction, and arbitrary operations on the\\nencoded information using only nearest-neighbor interactions.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:51:39Z\"}"}
