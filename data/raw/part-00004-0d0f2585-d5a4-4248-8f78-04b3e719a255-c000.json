However, they often rely on dominant, dataset-specific\\naction sequences rather than true video comprehension, a problem that we define\\nas ordinal bias. To address this issue, we propose two effective video\\nmanipulation methods: Action Masking, which masks frames of frequently\\nco-occurring actions, and Sequence Shuffling, which randomizes the order of\\naction segments. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that current\\nmodels exhibit significant performance drops when confronted with nonstandard\\naction sequences, underscoring their vulnerability to ordinal bias. Our\\nfindings emphasize the importance of rethinking evaluation strategies and\\ndeveloping models capable of generalizing beyond fixed action patterns in\\ndiverse instructional videos.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T05:03:51Z\"}"}
