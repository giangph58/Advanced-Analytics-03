The algorithm estimates the logarithm of the\\ndeterminant of an $n \\\\times n$ positive sparse matrix to an accuracy $\\\\epsilon$\\nin time ${\\\\cal O}(\\\\log n/\\\\epsilon^3)$, exponentially faster than previously\\nexisting classical or quantum algorithms that scale linearly in $n$. The\\nquantum spectral sampling algorithm generalizes to estimating any quantity\\n$\\\\sum_j f(\\\\lambda_j)$, where $\\\\lambda_j$ are the matrix eigenvalues. For\\nexample, the algorithm allows the efficient estimation of the partition\\nfunction $Z(\\\\beta) =\\\\sum_j e^{-\\\\beta E_j}$ of a Hamiltonian system with energy\\neigenvalues $E_j$, and of the entropy $ S =-\\\\sum_j p_j \\\\log p_j$ of a density\\nmatrix with eigenvalues $p_j$.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T10:32:36Z\"}"}
