In \\\\cite{viator2018}, the authors treated such domains as\\nperturbations of the disk, and they computed the first-order term of the\\nasymptotic expansions of the Steklov eigenvalues for reflection-symmetric\\nperturbations; here, we expand these first-order results beyond\\nreflection-symmetry. We also recover the second-order asymptotic expansions,\\nwhich enable us to prove that no Steklov eigenvalue beyond the first positive\\none is locally shape-optimized by the disk.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T16:13:28Z\"}"}
