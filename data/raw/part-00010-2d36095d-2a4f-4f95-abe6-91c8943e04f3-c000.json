Each node has a limited scope as it can only access local\\nmeasurements and share data with its neighbors. The problem of designing the\\nobserver gains is divided into two separate sub-problems: (i) design local\\noutput injection gains to mitigate the impact of measurement noise, and (ii)\\ndesign diffusive gains to compensate for the lack of information through a\\nconsensus protocol. A direct and computationally efficient synthesis strategy\\nis formulated by linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and solved via semidefinite\\nprogramming. Finally, two simulative scenarios are presented to illustrate the\\neffectiveness of the distributed observer when two different node-wise\\ndecompositions are adopted.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:33:24Z\"}"}
