Decisions should be made over sequences of actions to reach\\npreferable outcomes long term. The evaluation of outcomes, however, may invoke\\none or more moral theories, which might have conflicting judgements. Each\\ntheory will require differing representations of the ethical situation. For\\nexample, Utilitarianism measures numerical values, Deontology analyses duties,\\nand Virtue Ethics emphasises moral character. While balancing potentially\\nconflicting moral considerations, decisions may need to be made, for example,\\nto achieve morally neutral goals with minimal costs. In this paper, we\\nformalise the problem as a Multi-Moral Markov Decision Process and a\\nMulti-Moral Stochastic Shortest Path Problem. We develop a heuristic algorithm\\nbased on Multi-Objective AO*, utilising Sven-Ove Hansson's Hypothetical\\nRetrospection procedure for ethical reasoning under uncertainty. Our approach\\nis validated by a case study from Machine Ethics literature: the problem of\\nwhether to steal insulin for someone who needs it.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T12:03:15Z\"}"}
