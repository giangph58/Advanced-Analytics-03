However, in many settings, the\\ndiagnostic decision is not limited to a binary choice. ROC surfaces are\\nconsidered as a natural generalization of ROC curves in three-class diagnostic\\nproblems and the Volume Under the ROC Surface (VUS) was proposed as an index\\nfor the assessment of the diagnostic accuracy of the marker under\\nconsideration. In this paper, we propose an overlap measure (OVL) in the case\\nof three-class diagnostic problems. Specifically, parametric and non-parametric\\napproaches for the estimation of OVL are introduced. We evaluate this measure\\nthrough simulations and compare it with the well-known measure given by VUS.\\nFurthermore, our proposal is applied to the clinical diagnosis of early stage\\nAlzheimer's disease.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T09:33:47Z\"}"}
