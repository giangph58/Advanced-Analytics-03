Two\\npackaging options for such systems are the established organic substrates and\\nthe emerging glass substrates. These substrates are used to implement the\\ninter-chiplet interconnect (ICI), which is crucial for overall system\\nperformance. To guide the development of ICIs, we introduce three design\\nprinciples for ICI network topologies on organic and glass substrates. Based on\\nour design principles, we propose the novel FoldedHexaTorus network topology.\\nOur evaluation shows that the FoldedHexaTorus achieves significantly higher\\nthroughput than state-of-the-art topologies while maintaining low latency.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AR\", \"categories\": \"cs.AR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:07:36Z\"}"}
