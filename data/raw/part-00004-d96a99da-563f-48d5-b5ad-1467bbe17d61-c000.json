{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05985v1\", \"title\": \"Adaptive RISE Control for Dual-Arm Unmanned Aerial Manipulator Systems\\n  with Deep Neural Networks\", \"summary\": \"The unmanned aerial manipulator system, consisting of a multirotor UAV\\n(unmanned aerial vehicle) and a manipulator, has attracted considerable\\ninterest from researchers. Nevertheless, the operation of a dual-arm\\nmanipulator poses a dynamic challenge, as the CoM (center of mass) of the\\nsystem changes with manipulator movement, potentially impacting the multirotor\\nUAV. Additionally, unmodeled effects, parameter uncertainties, and external\\ndisturbances can significantly degrade control performance, leading to\\nunforeseen dangers. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a nonlinear\\nadaptive RISE (robust integral of the sign of the error) controller based on\\nDNN (deep neural network). The first step involves establishing the kinematic\\nand dynamic model of the dual-arm aerial manipulator. Subsequently, the\\nadaptive RISE controller is proposed with a DNN feedforward term to effectively\\naddress both internal and external challenges. By employing Lyapunov\\ntechniques, the asymptotic convergence of the tracking error signals are\\nguaranteed rigorously. Notably, this paper marks a pioneering effort by\\npresenting the first DNN-based adaptive RISE controller design accompanied by a\\ncomprehensive stability analysis. To validate the practicality and robustness\\nof the proposed control approach, several groups of actual hardware experiments\\nare conducted. The results confirm the efficacy of the developed methodology in\\nhandling real-world scenarios, thereby offering valuable insights into the\\nperformance of the dual-arm aerial manipulator system.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:43:45Z\"}"}
