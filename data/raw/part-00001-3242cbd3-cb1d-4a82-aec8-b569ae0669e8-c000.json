{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16546v1\", \"title\": \"Tinkering Against Scaling\", \"summary\": \"The ascent of scaling in artificial intelligence research has revolutionized\\nthe field over the past decade, yet it presents significant challenges for\\nacademic researchers, particularly in computational social science and critical\\nalgorithm studies. The dominance of large language models, characterized by\\ntheir extensive parameters and costly training processes, creates a disparity\\nwhere only industry-affiliated researchers can access these resources. This\\nimbalance restricts academic researchers from fully understanding their tools,\\nleading to issues like reproducibility in computational social science and a\\nreliance on black-box metaphors in critical studies.\\n  To address these challenges, we propose a \\\"tinkering\\\" approach that is\\ninspired by existing works. This method involves engaging with smaller models\\nor components that are manageable for ordinary researchers, fostering hands-on\\ninteraction with algorithms. We argue that tinkering is both a way of making\\nand knowing for computational social science and a way of knowing for critical\\nstudies, and fundamentally, it is a way of caring that has broader implications\\nfor both fields.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T09:21:39Z\"}"}
