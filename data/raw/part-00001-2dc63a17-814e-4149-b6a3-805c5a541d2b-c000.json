Since 1,3-butadiene is non-polar, we searched for its cyano derivative,\\nwhich exists in the form of three different polar isomers, in the cold dense\\ncloud TMC-1. We used the most recent data obtained with the Yebes 40m telescope\\nin the Q band (31.0-50.3 GHz) in the frame of the QUIJOTE project. We do not\\ndetect any of the two isomers of 1-cyano-1,3-butadiene, and derive 3sigma upper\\nlimits to their column densities of 1.2e10 cm-2 and 2.0e10 cm-2 for E- and\\nZ-1-cyano-1,3-butadiene, respectively. Our results are not consistent with\\nthose from Cooke et al. (2023), who determine a column density of 3.8e10 cm-2\\nfor E-1-cyano-1,3-butadiene in TMC-1 using GBT data and a line stack technique.\\nAt the current level of sensitivity of our data, there is tentative evidence\\nfor the presence of the third cyano derivative isomer, 2-cyano-1,3-butadiene,\\nalthough a firm detection must await more sensitive data. We derive an upper\\nlimit to its column density of 3.1e10 cm-2. This isomer cannot be formed in the\\nreaction between CN and 1,3-butadiene, according to experimental and\\ntheoretical studies, and thus we speculate whether it could arise from\\nneutral-neutral reactions like C2H3 + CH2CHCN and CH2CCN + C2H4. From the upper\\nlimit on the abundance of 1-cyano-1,3-butadiene derived here, we estimate that\\nthe abundance of 1,3-butadiene in TMC-1 is below 1e-11 - 1e-10 relative to H2.\\nThe low abundance inferred for 1,3-butadiene makes it unlikely that it plays an\\nimportant role in bottom-up routes to cyclopentadiene and benzene.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T08:39:13Z\"}"}
