Hence, the prediction of grain\\nmicrostructures emerging from solidification processes at relevant macroscopic\\nscale is essential to the design or optimization of new alloys and processing\\nconditions. Yet, despite the broad range of multi-scale models proposed so far,\\nall of them suffer from computational limitations, such that advances from\\ncomputational and algorithm perspectives remain needed. Here, we present a\\nnovel approach for tracking crystallographic solidification grain envelopes\\ncapable of predicting competitive growth scenarios and columnar-to-equiaxed\\ntransitions for stationary grains. The model relies on classical assumptions\\nand equations in use in several broadly used and thoroughly validated\\napproaches (e.g. cellular automata). Yet, our approach defines the grain\\nenvelope using Lagrangian particles and tracks their evolution using an\\nalgorithm and an implementation relying on scalable libraries and using modern\\nCPU/GPU architectures. The model is used to simulate several benchmarks of\\nincreasing complexity, and the results are compared to analytical,\\nexperimental, and numerical results from literature for the purpose of model\\nvalidation. To highlight the applicability to real-world processes and the\\npossibility of coupling the model with existing physics-based simulation tools,\\nthe model is also (one-way) coupled with a multiphysics\\nlaser-material-interaction model to simulate competitive grain growth during\\nlaser beam welding of steel.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T11:34:08Z\"}"}
