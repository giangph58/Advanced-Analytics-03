Scheduled for\\ninstallation around 2027, HERD is expected to operate for at least a decade.\\nThe main scientific objectives include indirect detection of dark matter with\\nunprecedented sensitivity, studying the cosmic-ray spectrum and composition up\\nto the knee, and observing all-sky gamma rays with energies above 100 MeV. HERD\\nis designed as a large-acceptance telescope with a unique design aimed at\\nmaximizing its efficiency. It comprises a central 3D imaging calorimeter (CALO)\\nmade of LYSO crystals, encircled by four complementary subdetectors on its top\\nand four lateral faces: the scintillating fiber tracking detector (FIT), the\\nplastic scintillator detector (PSD), the silicon charge detector (SCD), and a\\ntransition radiation detector (TRD) on one lateral side. To fully harness HERD\\ngamma-ray detection capabilities down to 100 MeV, an advanced ultra-low-energy\\ngamma-ray (ULEG) trigger system has been developed. We present an extensive\\noverview of the design, performance, and optimization of the gamma-ray trigger\\nsystem supported by software simulations and preliminary results from the\\nsuccessful implementation of the HERD prototype at CERN's PS and SPS beam test\\ncampaigns in Fall 2023.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T13:27:54Z\"}"}
