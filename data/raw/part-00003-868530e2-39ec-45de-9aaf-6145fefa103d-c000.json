{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11322v1\", \"title\": \"Fast detection and reconstruction of merging Massive Black Hole Binary\\n  signals\", \"summary\": \"The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect gravitational waves\\nfrom the population of merging massive black holes binaries (MBHBs) throughout\\nthe Universe. The LISA data stream will feature many superposed signals from\\ndifferent astrophysical sources, requiring a global fit procedure. Most of the\\nMBHB signals will be loud enough to be detected days or even weeks before the\\nmerger; and for those sources LISA will be able to predict the time of the\\nmerger well in advance of the coalescence, as well as an approximate position\\nin the sky. In this paper, we present a fast detection and signal\\nreconstruction scheme for massive black hole binaries in the LISA observation\\nband. We propose: (i) a detection scheme for MBHB mergers allowing a first\\nsubtraction of these signals for the purpose of a global fit, and (ii) an\\nefficient early detection scheme providing a time-of-merger estimate for a\\npre-merger signal, that will allow to trigger a protection period, placing LISA\\nin ``do not disturb'' mode and enabling more detailed analysis that will\\nfacilitate multi-messenger observations. We highlight the effect of confusion\\nof several overlapping in time MBHB signals in the pre-merger detection.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:01:55Z\"}"}
