Nevertheless, teleoperation still faces\\nchallenges, such as reduced situational awareness. Since situational awareness\\nis primarily built through the remote operator's visual perception, the\\nGraphical User Interface (GUI) design is critical. In addition to video feeds,\\nsupplemental informational elements are crucial - not only for the\\npredominantly studied Remote Driving but also for the arising desk-based Remote\\nAssistance concepts. This work develops a GUI for different teleoperation\\nconcepts by identifying key informational elements during the teleoperation\\nprocess through expert interviews (N = 9). Following this, a static and dynamic\\nGUI prototype is developed and evaluated in a click-dummy study (N = 36).\\nThereby, the dynamic GUI adapts the number of displayed elements according to\\nthe teleoperation phase. Results show that both GUIs achieve good System\\nUsability Scale (SUS) ratings, with the dynamic GUI significantly outperforming\\nthe static version in both usability and task completion time. The User\\nExperience Questionnaire (UEQ) score shows potential for improvement. To\\nenhance the user experience, the GUI should be evaluated in a follow-up study\\nthat includes interaction with a real vehicle.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T12:09:11Z\"}"}
