{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05353v1\", \"title\": \"Weighted Envy-Freeness Revisited: Indivisible Resource and House\\n  Allocations\", \"summary\": \"Envy-Freeness is one of the most fundamental and important concepts in fair\\nallocation. Some recent studies have focused on the concept of weighted\\nenvy-freeness. Under this concept, each agent is assigned a weight, and their\\nvaluations are divided by their weights when assessing fairness. This concept\\ncan promote more fairness in some scenarios. But on the other hand,\\nexperimental research has shown that this weighted envy-freeness significantly\\nreduces the likelihood of fair allocations. When we must allocate the\\nresources, we may propose fairness concepts with lower requirements that are\\npotentially more feasible to implement. In this paper, we revisit weighted\\nenvy-freeness and propose a new concept called SumAvg-envy-freeness, which\\nsubstantially increases the existence of fair allocations. This new concept can\\nbe seen as a complement of the normal weighted envy-fairness. Furthermore, we\\nsystematically study the computational complexity of finding fair allocations\\nunder the old and new weighted fairness concepts in two types of classic\\nproblems: Indivisible Resource Allocation and House Allocation. Our study\\nprovides a comprehensive characterization of various properties of weighted\\nenvy-freeness.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GT\", \"categories\": \"cs.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:42:01Z\"}"}
