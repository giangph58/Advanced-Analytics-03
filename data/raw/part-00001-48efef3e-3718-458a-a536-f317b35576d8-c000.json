{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09905v1\", \"title\": \"Fusing Bluetooth with Pedestrian Dead Reckoning: A Floor Plan-Assisted\\n  Positioning Approach\", \"summary\": \"Floor plans can provide valuable prior information that helps enhance the\\naccuracy of indoor positioning systems. However, existing research typically\\nfaces challenges in efficiently leveraging floor plan information and applying\\nit to complex indoor layouts. To fully exploit information from floor plans for\\npositioning, we propose a floor plan-assisted fusion positioning algorithm\\n(FP-BP) using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR).\\nIn the considered system, a user holding a smartphone walks through a\\npositioning area with BLE beacons installed on the ceiling, and can locate\\nhimself in real time. In particular, FP-BP consists of two phases. In the\\noffline phase, FP-BP programmatically extracts map features from a stylized\\nfloor plan based on their binary masks, and constructs a mapping function to\\nidentify the corresponding map feature of any given position on the map. In the\\nonline phase, FP-BP continuously computes BLE positions and PDR results from\\nBLE signals and smartphone sensors, where a novel grid-based maximum likelihood\\nestimation (GML) algorithm is introduced to enhance BLE positioning. Then, a\\nparticle filter is used to fuse them and obtain an initial estimate. Finally,\\nFP-BP performs post-position correction to obtain the final position based on\\nits specific map feature. Experimental results show that FP-BP can achieve a\\nreal-time mean positioning accuracy of 1.19 m, representing an improvement of\\nover 28% compared to existing floor plan-fused baseline algorithms.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T06:00:39Z\"}"}
