{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04172v1\", \"title\": \"A Dataset and Toolkit for Multiparameter Cardiovascular Physiology\\n  Sensing on Rings\", \"summary\": \"Smart rings offer a convenient way to continuously and unobtrusively monitor\\ncardiovascular physiological signals. However, a gap remains between the ring\\nhardware and reliable methods for estimating cardiovascular parameters, partly\\ndue to the lack of publicly available datasets and standardized analysis tools.\\nIn this work, we present $\\\\tau$-Ring, the first open-source ring-based dataset\\ndesigned for cardiovascular physiological sensing. The dataset comprises\\nphotoplethysmography signals (infrared and red channels) and 3-axis\\naccelerometer data collected from two rings (reflective and transmissive\\noptical paths), with 28.21 hours of raw data from 34 subjects across seven\\nactivities. $\\\\tau$-Ring encompasses both stationary and motion scenarios, as\\nwell as stimulus-evoked abnormal physiological states, annotated with four\\nground-truth labels: heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and blood\\npressure. Using our proposed RingTool toolkit, we evaluated three widely-used\\nphysics-based methods and four cutting-edge deep learning approaches. Our\\nresults show superior performance compared to commercial rings, achieving best\\nMAE values of 5.18 BPM for heart rate, 2.98 BPM for respiratory rate, 3.22\\\\%\\nfor oxygen saturation, and 13.33/7.56 mmHg for systolic/diastolic blood\\npressure estimation. The open-sourced dataset and toolkit aim to foster further\\nresearch and community-driven advances in ring-based cardiovascular health\\nsensing.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.HC,physics.med-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T06:56:00Z\"}"}
