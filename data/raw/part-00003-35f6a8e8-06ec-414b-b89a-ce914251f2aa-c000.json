{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10412v1\", \"title\": \"AI-Driven Code Refactoring: Using Graph Neural Networks to Enhance\\n  Software Maintainability\", \"summary\": \"This study explores Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as a transformative tool for\\ncode refactoring, using abstract syntax trees (ASTs) to boost software\\nmaintainability. It analyzes a dataset of 2 million snippets from CodeSearchNet\\nand a custom 75000-file GitHub Python corpus, comparing GNNs against rule-based\\nSonarQube and decision trees. Metrics include cyclomatic complexity (target\\nbelow 10), coupling (target below 5), and refactoring precision. GNNs achieve\\n92% accuracy, reducing complexity by 35% and coupling by 33%, outperforming\\nSonarQube (78%, 16%) and decision trees (85%, 25%). Preprocessing fixed 60% of\\nsyntax errors. Bar graphs, tables, and AST visuals clarify results. This offers\\na scalable AI-driven path to cleaner codebases, which is crucial for software\\nengineering.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.LG,cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:58:54Z\"}"}
