{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16022v1\", \"title\": \"Non-Renormalizable SU(5) GUTs: Leptoquark-Induced Neutrino Masses\", \"summary\": \"We revisit the doublet-triplet splitting problem within the $SU(5)$ gauge\\ngroup framework to advocate a viable regime with the light scalar leptoquark of\\nthe doublet-triplet splitting notoriety that is compatible with the current\\nexperimental bounds on partial proton decay lifetimes. We explicitly\\ndemonstrate, through a consistent use of higher-dimensional operators, how to\\nimplement suppression of baryon number violating interactions of the\\naforementioned color triplet. Our study thus offers an alternative approach to\\nthe doublet-triplet splitting problem as it removes a need for an extreme mass\\nhierarchy between the partners residing in the same representation. We\\nfurthermore pursue two different extensions of two distinct symmetry breaking\\nscenarios of $SU(5)$, one with a $24$-dimensional representation and the other\\none with a $75$-dimensional representation, to produce comparative study of\\nnovel consequences for the gauge coupling unification and the one-loop level\\nneutrino mass generation. Our results point towards qualitatively novel $SU(5)$\\nscenarios, where the light scalar leptoquarks, responsible for the neutrino\\nmass generation, might be even accessible at colliders and thus serve as an\\naccelerator accessible portal to the high-scale physics.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T16:39:02Z\"}"}
