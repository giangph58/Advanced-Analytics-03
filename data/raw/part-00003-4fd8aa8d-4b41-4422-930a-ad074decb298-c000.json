Deploying XL-MIMO in high-frequency\\nbands not only increases the number of antennas, but also fundamentally alters\\nchannel propagation characteristics, placing the user equipments (UE) in the\\nradiative near-field of the base station. This paper proposes a parametric\\nestimation method using the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm to\\nextract UE location data from uplink pilot signals. These parameters are used\\nto reconstruct the spatial correlation matrix, followed by an approximation of\\nthe minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimator. Numerical results show\\nthat the proposed method outperforms the least-squares (LS) estimator in terms\\nof the normalized mean-square error (NMSE), even without prior UE location\\nknowledge.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T10:08:15Z\"}"}
