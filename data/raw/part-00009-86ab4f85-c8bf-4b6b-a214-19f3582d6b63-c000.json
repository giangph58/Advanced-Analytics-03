In this paper, we propose a\\nhierarchical control framework leveraging neural network verification\\ntechniques to design control barrier functions (CBFs) and policy correction\\nmechanisms that ensure safe reinforcement learning navigation policies. Our\\napproach relies on probabilistic enumeration to identify unsafe regions of\\noperation, which are then used to construct a safe CBF-based control layer\\napplicable to arbitrary policies. We validate our framework both in simulation\\nand on a real robot, using a standard mobile robot benchmark and a highly\\ndynamic aquatic environmental monitoring task. These experiments demonstrate\\nthe ability of the proposed solution to correct unsafe actions while preserving\\nefficient navigation behavior. Our results show the promise of developing\\nhierarchical verification-based systems to enable safe and robust navigation\\nbehaviors in complex scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T13:47:25Z\"}"}
