We exemplify its scope in the very relevant and so far vaguely\\nexplored dynamics of dual-mode phonon lasing when two independent mechanical\\nmodes are directly coupled to one optical field. We uncover a plethora of\\ndifferent lasing regimes in a fixed and realistic cavity geometry, including\\nsingle- and dual-mode lasing, perfect synchronization of different mechanical\\nmodes, and quasiperiodic time crystals. All dynamical regimes are unambiguously\\nassociated with bifurcations of different natures, which may exhibit both super\\nand sub-critical natures characterizing the often hysteretic behavior of the\\nsystems when they are externally driven by a time-varying laser source. Our\\nresults, generalizable to any other optomechanical system, open unprecedented\\npathways to understand and control the formation and dynamics of optomechanical\\nfrequency combs.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,nlin.PS\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:05:23Z\"}"}
