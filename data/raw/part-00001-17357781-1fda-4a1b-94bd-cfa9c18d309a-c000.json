{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07657v1\", \"title\": \"Single-Pixel Imaging Technology in Holographic Microscopy\", \"summary\": \"We propose a holographic microscopy method based on single-pixel imaging\\ntechnology (HM-SPI). We used a holographic microscopy method based on in-line\\nGabor holography. In single-pixel imaging technology, cyclic binary masks and\\namplitude-phase masks are used instead of cyclic Hadamard masks. These masks\\nare generated using the quadratic residue and twin-prime techniques. Numerical\\nresults are presented for both cases. Unlike the traditional approach of using\\nDMD technology, our model considers a photodetector as a single-pixel detector.\\nWe propose a method based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm to\\nreconstruct the original field, which has a computational complexity of\\nO(NlogN). This approach opens up prospects for the development of compact\\nholographic systems capable of operating across a wide spectral range and under\\nlimited computational resources.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T11:15:46Z\"}"}
