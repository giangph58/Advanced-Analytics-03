{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12915v1\", \"title\": \"ConExion: Concept Extraction with Large Language Models\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, an approach for concept extraction from documents using\\npre-trained large language models (LLMs) is presented. Compared with\\nconventional methods that extract keyphrases summarizing the important\\ninformation discussed in a document, our approach tackles a more challenging\\ntask of extracting all present concepts related to the specific domain, not\\njust the important ones. Through comprehensive evaluations of two widely used\\nbenchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our method improves the F1 score\\ncompared to state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we explore the potential\\nof using prompts within these models for unsupervised concept extraction. The\\nextracted concepts are intended to support domain coverage evaluation of\\nontologies and facilitate ontology learning, highlighting the effectiveness of\\nLLMs in concept extraction tasks. Our source code and datasets are publicly\\navailable at https://github.com/ISE-FIZKarlsruhe/concept_extraction.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T13:05:14Z\"}"}
