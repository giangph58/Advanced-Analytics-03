{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19839v1\", \"title\": \"SRMF: A Data Augmentation and Multimodal Fusion Approach for Long-Tail\\n  UHR Satellite Image Segmentation\", \"summary\": \"The long-tail problem presents a significant challenge to the advancement of\\nsemantic segmentation in ultra-high-resolution (UHR) satellite imagery. While\\nprevious efforts in UHR semantic segmentation have largely focused on\\nmulti-branch network architectures that emphasize multi-scale feature\\nextraction and fusion, they have often overlooked the importance of addressing\\nthe long-tail issue. In contrast to prior UHR methods that focused on\\nindependent feature extraction, we emphasize data augmentation and multimodal\\nfeature fusion to alleviate the long-tail problem. In this paper, we introduce\\nSRMF, a novel framework for semantic segmentation in UHR satellite imagery. Our\\napproach addresses the long-tail class distribution by incorporating a\\nmulti-scale cropping technique alongside a data augmentation strategy based on\\nsemantic reordering and resampling. To further enhance model performance, we\\npropose a multimodal fusion-based general representation knowledge injection\\nmethod, which, for the first time, fuses text and visual features without the\\nneed for individual region text descriptions, extracting more robust features.\\nExtensive experiments on the URUR, GID, and FBP datasets demonstrate that our\\nmethod improves mIoU by 3.33\\\\%, 0.66\\\\%, and 0.98\\\\%, respectively, achieving\\nstate-of-the-art performance.
