{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20913v1\", \"title\": \"Design and performance of the prototype of the new Particle\\n  Identification system for the MAGNEX spectrometer within the NUMEN project\", \"summary\": \"The MAGNEX large acceptance magnetic spectrometer is installed at the\\nLaboratori Nazionali del Sud of the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare\\n(INFN-LNS) in Catania. In the past, MAGNEX experimental campaigns were\\nperformed using ion beams up to $10^{10}$ pps provided by the Superconducting\\nCyclotron (SC) accelerator. Nevertheless, in the context of the NUMEN (Nuclear\\nMatrix Elements for Neutrinoless double beta decay) project, which aims to get\\naccurate values of the tiny Double Charge Exchange (DCE) cross-sections for a\\nlarge number of nuclei of interest for the neutrinoless double beta decay\\n(0$\\\\nu\\\\beta\\\\beta$), the SC is being fully refurbished featuring ion beams with\\nenergies from 15 up to 70 MeV/u and intensities up to $10^{13}$ pps. The high\\nrate of incident particles demands a complete upgrade of the MAGNEX detectors,\\nwhich will consist of a new Particle Identification (PID) system and a new gas\\ntracker detector along with a $\\\\gamma$-calorimeter. The PID system is equipped\\nwith a large number (720) of Silicon Carbide-Cesium Iodide (Tallium doped)\\ntelescopes. A prototype of the PID wall has been built and studied thanks to an\\nexperimental test with an $^{18}$O beam at 275 MeV incident energy performed at\\nINFN-Laboratori Nazionali di Legnaro, Italy. In this manuscript, the design of\\nthe new PID system, the in-beam test experimental set-up, and the prototype's\\nperformances are presented.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T16:33:39Z\"}"}
