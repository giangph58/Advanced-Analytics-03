We first find the stress-energy tensor using\\nrelativistic kinetic theory, modelling the field as a thermal gas of massless\\nbosons. We then compute the renormalized stress-energy tensor of the scalar\\nfield in quantum field theory and compare it with that resulting from\\nrelativistic kinetic theory.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T17:38:21Z\"}"}
