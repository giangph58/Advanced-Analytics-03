We show that under mild and generic conditions, it is a smooth manifold\\nthat can be viewed as the total space of a certain fiber bundle and that this\\nbundle comes equipped with a natural connection. We then proceed to show\\nparallel transport for this connection does exist and explore some of its\\nproperties. In particular, we elucidate how one can to some extent measure the\\nvariation of the system eigenvalues restricted to a given fiber.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS,math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T15:02:10Z\"}"}
