Societally Beneficial\\n  Perceptual Filter Bubbles in Personalized Reality\", \"summary\": \"Extended Reality (XR) technologies enable the personalized mediation of an\\nindividual's perceivable reality across modalities, thereby creating a\\nPersonalized Reality (PR). While this may lead to individually beneficial\\neffects in the form of more efficient, more fun, and safer experiences, it may\\nalso lead to perceptual filter bubbles since individuals are exposed\\npredominantly or exclusively to content that is congruent with their existing\\nbeliefs and opinions. This undermining of a shared basis for interaction and\\ndiscussion through constrained perceptual worldviews may impact society through\\nincreased polarization and other well-documented negative effects of filter\\nbubbles. In this paper, we argue that this issue can be mitigated by increasing\\nindividuals' awareness of their current perspective and providing avenues for\\ndevelopment, including through support for engineered serendipity and fostering\\nof self-actualization that already show promise for traditional recommender\\nsystems. We discuss how these methods may be transferred to XR to yield\\nvaluable tools to give people transparency and agency over their perceptual\\nworldviews in a responsible manner.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T14:36:56Z\"}"}
