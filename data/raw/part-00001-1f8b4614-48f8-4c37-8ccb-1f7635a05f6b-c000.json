To investigate the underlying pairing\\nmechanism and symmetry in this complex system, we propose and analyze a mixed\\nspin-$1$ and spin-$\\\\frac{1}{2}$ bilayer $t$-$J$ model in the strong coupling\\nregime. This model explicitly incorporates the crucial role of strong Hund's\\ncoupling, which favors the formation of local spin-triplet states from the two\\nonsite $E_g$ orbital electrons at half-filling. We further investigate the\\nmodel using both slave-particle mean-field theory and the density matrix\\nrenormalization group method. Our simulation results reveal that the dominate\\npairing channel is the interlayer one in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. The Hund's\\ncoupling is shown to enhance SC within a reasonable physical range. Moreover,\\nelectron doping strengthens SC by increasing carrier density; in contrast, hole\\ndoping weakens SC. These findings offer critical insights into the\\nunconventional SC of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and underline the important\\nrole of orbital-selective behavior and Hund's rule.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T14:42:22Z\"}"}
