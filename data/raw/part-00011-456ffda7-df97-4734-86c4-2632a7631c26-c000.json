{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16806v1\", \"title\": \"V4141 Sgr: Outflows and repeated outbursts\", \"summary\": \"In this work, we analyze the ongoing brightening of the poorly studied\\nsymbiotic star V4141 Sgr and examine its long-term variability. We present new\\nlow-resolution spectroscopic observations of the system in its bright state and\\ncombine them with multi-color photometric data from our observations, ASAS-SN,\\nATLAS, and Gaia DR3. To investigate its long-term evolution, we also\\nincorporate historical data, including photographic plates, constructing a\\nlight curve spanning more than a century. Our analysis reveals that V4141 Sgr\\nhas undergone multiple outbursts, with at least one exhibiting characteristics\\ntypical of \\\"slow\\\" symbiotic novae. The current outburst is characterized by the\\nejection of optically thick material and possibly bipolar jets, a phenomenon\\nobserved in only a small fraction of symbiotic stars. These findings establish\\nV4141 Sgr as an intriguing target for continued monitoring.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:25:14Z\"}"}
