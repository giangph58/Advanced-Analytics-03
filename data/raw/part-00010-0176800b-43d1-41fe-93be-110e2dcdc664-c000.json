For the examples of Yang-Mills and QCD, we prove that it\\nis actually equivalent to the perturbative S-matrix of gauge theory, restricted\\nto physical particle states. The role of classical gauge invariance is revealed\\nalong the way. The main tool are \\\"dressed fields\\\", that are intermediate\\nbetween free fields and interacting fields, and for which we give explicit\\nformulas at all orders. The renormalization of loops, as well as\\nnon-perturbative issues are not adressed, but we hint at the possibility,\\nenabled by our approach, that qualitative traces of confinement may be visible\\nalready at the level of the dressed fields.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T11:11:54Z\"}"}
