{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03337v1\", \"title\": \"The Inverse Drum Machine: Source Separation Through Joint Transcription\\n  and Analysis-by-Synthesis\", \"summary\": \"We introduce the Inverse Drum Machine (IDM), a novel approach to drum source\\nseparation that combines analysis-by-synthesis with deep learning. Unlike\\nrecent supervised methods that rely on isolated stems, IDM requires only\\ntranscription annotations. It jointly optimizes automatic drum transcription\\nand one-shot drum sample synthesis in an end-to-end framework. By convolving\\nsynthesized one-shot samples with estimated onsets-mimicking a drum machine-IDM\\nreconstructs individual drum stems and trains a neural network to match the\\noriginal mixture. Evaluations on the StemGMD dataset show that IDM achieves\\nseparation performance on par with state-of-the-art supervised methods, while\\nsubstantially outperforming matrix decomposition baselines.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SD\", \"categories\": \"cs.SD,eess.AS,eess.SP,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T09:08:50Z\"}"}
