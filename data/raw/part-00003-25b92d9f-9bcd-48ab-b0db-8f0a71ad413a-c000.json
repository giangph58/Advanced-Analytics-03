{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14982v1\", \"title\": \"Understanding the Valence Quark Structure of the Pion through GTMDs\", \"summary\": \"We investigate the internal structure of the pion using generalized\\ntransverse momentum-dependent parton distributions (GTMDs) within the\\nlight-cone quark model. By solving the quark-quark correlator, we derive the\\ntwist-$2$, $3$, and $4$ quark GTMDs in terms of light-front wave functions\\n(LFWFs). Out of the $16$ possible GTMDs, $12$ are found to be nonzero.\\nFurthermore, we extract the valence quark transverse momentum-dependent parton\\ndistributions (TMDs) and generalized parton distributions (GPDs) from their\\ncorresponding GTMDs. Additionally, we compute the valence quark electromagnetic\\nform factors (FFs) and parton distribution functions (PDFs) up to twist-$4$.\\nThe elastic charge radius of the pion is determined to be $0.558$ fm. Our\\nresults exhibit a qualitative agreement with predictions from other theoretical\\nmodel like Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model, Light-front holographic model, and\\nspectator model at the leading twist. This study provides a comprehensive\\ninsight into the internal structure of the pion.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T09:19:15Z\"}"}
