The method integrates (i) dimensionality\\nreduction, here, a simple proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) projection;\\n(ii) a generalized autoregressive model to forecast reduced dynamics, here, a\\nreservoir computer; (iii) online adaptation to update the reservoir computer\\n(the model), here, ensemble sequential data assimilation.We demonstrate the\\nframework on a wake past a cylinder governed by the Navier-Stokes equations,\\nexploring the assimilation of full flow fields (projected onto POD modes) and\\nsparse sensors. Three scenarios are examined: a na\\\\\\\"ive physical state\\nestimation; a two-fold estimation of physical and reservoir states; and a\\nthree-fold estimation that also adjusts the model parameters. The two-fold\\nstrategy significantly improves ensemble convergence and reduces reconstruction\\nerror compared to the na\\\\\\\"ive approach. The three-fold approach enables robust\\nonline training of partially-trained reservoir computers, overcoming\\nlimitations of a priori training. By unifying data-driven reduced order\\nmodelling with Bayesian data assimilation, this work opens new opportunities\\nfor scalable online model learning for nonlinear time series forecasting.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,physics.flu-dyn,stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T14:35:54Z\"}"}
