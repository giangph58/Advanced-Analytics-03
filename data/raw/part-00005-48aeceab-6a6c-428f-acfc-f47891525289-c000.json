In this article we conduct a thorough\\ninvestigation of possible similar results for higher order derivatives. We\\nuncover that such results are indeed a consequence of a stronger phenomenon\\nregarding the growth of $l^p(\\\\Z)$ norms of the derivatives of characteristic\\nfunctions of finite subsets of $\\\\Z$. Along the way we discover very interesting\\nconnections to Prouhot-Tarry-Escott (PTE) problem, and to zeros of complex\\npolynomials with restricted coefficients (Littlewood-type polynomials).\", \"main_category\": \"math.CA\", \"categories\": \"math.CA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T15:26:48Z\"}"}
