However, high stakes applications\\nsuch as recommendation systems in online gaming, introduce further complexities\\ndue to player's psychology (intent) driven by gameplay experiences and the\\ninherent volatility on the platform. These factors create highly sparse,\\npartially overlapping state spaces across policies, further influenced by the\\nexperiment path selection logic which biases state spaces towards specific\\npolicies. Current SOTA methods constrain learning from such offline data by\\nclipping known counterfactual actions as out-of-distribution due to poor\\ngeneralization across unobserved states. Further aggravating conservative\\nQ-learning and necessitating more online exploration. FAST-Q introduces a novel\\napproach that (1) leverages Gradient Reversal Learning to construct balanced\\nstate representations, regularizing the policy-specific bias between the\\nplayer's state and action thereby enabling counterfactual estimation; (2)\\nsupports offline counterfactual exploration in parallel with static data\\nexploitation; and (3) proposes a Q-value decomposition strategy for\\nmulti-objective optimization, facilitating explainable recommendations over\\nshort and long-term objectives. These innovations demonstrate superiority of\\nFAST-Q over prior SOTA approaches and demonstrates at least 0.15 percent\\nincrease in player returns, 2 percent improvement in lifetime value (LTV), 0.4\\npercent enhancement in the recommendation driven engagement, 2 percent\\nimprovement in the player's platform dwell time and an impressive 10 percent\\nreduction in the costs associated with the recommendation, on our volatile\\ngaming platform.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T07:32:40Z\"}"}
