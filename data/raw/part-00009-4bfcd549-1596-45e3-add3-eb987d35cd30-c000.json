First, we derive the lump solutions using a positive quadratic\\npolynomial within the Hirota perturbation technique. Next, We study the\\nexplicit interactions between lumps and one or two-kink waves, and observe\\ndouble lump patterns. Furthermore, we discover the interactions of breathers,\\nrevealing a diffusion-like behavior. We notice that breather waves can interact\\nwith periodic, kink, and bright solitons for specific parameter sets in the CB\\nsystem. Interactions between two chains of double breathers are also found. We\\nanalyze our results using a combination of symbolic computations and graphical\\nrepresentations, providing a deeper understanding of their behavior. This study\\nreveals previously unreported nonlinear dynamics in the CB system.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.PS\", \"categories\": \"nlin.PS,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T10:55:49Z\"}"}
