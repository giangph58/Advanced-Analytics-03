Being compatible with\\nexisting fiber networks, entangled photons and quantum memories at\\ntelecom-wavelength are of central interest for such a scalable quantum network.\\nHere, we demonstrate quantum teleportation from a telecom-wavelength photonic\\nqubit to a solid-state quantum memory based on erbium-ion ensembles, which have\\na native optical transition at 1.5 $\\\\mu$m telecom C-band. To accomplish this,\\nwe use chip-scale silicon nitride micro-resonators to generate entangled\\nphotons with narrow linewidth, compatible with the quantum memory. We confirm\\nthe quality of the quantum teleportation procedure using quantum state and\\nprocess tomography techniques, in which both the quantum state and process\\nfidelities exceeds the classical limit. These results pave the way for the\\nrealization of scalable quantum networks based on solid-state devices.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:28:11Z\"}"}
