It has recently been shown\\nthat this problem can be efficiently solved through the notion of Control\\nBarrier Functions (CBFs). However, for nonholonomic vehicles that are required\\nto keep positive speeds, existing CBFs lose their validity. To overcome this\\nlimitation, we propose a hybrid formulation based on synergistic CBFs (SCBFs),\\nwhich leverages a discrete switching mechanism to avoid configurations that\\nwould render the CBF invalid. Unlike existing approaches, our method ensures\\nsafety in the presence of moving obstacles and inter-agent interactions while\\nrespecting nonzero speed restrictions. We formally analyze the feasibility of\\nthe constraints with respect to actuation limits, and the efficacy of the\\nsolution is demonstrated in simulation of a multi-agent coordination problem in\\nthe presence of moving obstacles.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:20:38Z\"}"}
