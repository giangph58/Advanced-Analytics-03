{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15267v1\", \"title\": \"Diffusion Bridge Models for 3D Medical Image Translation\", \"summary\": \"Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides crucial insights into the\\nmicrostructure of the human brain, but it can be time-consuming to acquire\\ncompared to more readily available T1-weighted (T1w) magnetic resonance imaging\\n(MRI). To address this challenge, we propose a diffusion bridge model for 3D\\nbrain image translation between T1w MRI and DTI modalities. Our model learns to\\ngenerate high-quality DTI fractional anisotropy (FA) images from T1w images and\\nvice versa, enabling cross-modality data augmentation and reducing the need for\\nextensive DTI acquisition. We evaluate our approach using perceptual\\nsimilarity, pixel-level agreement, and distributional consistency metrics,\\ndemonstrating strong performance in capturing anatomical structures and\\npreserving information on white matter integrity. The practical utility of the\\nsynthetic data is validated through sex classification and Alzheimer's disease\\nclassification tasks, where the generated images achieve comparable performance\\nto real data. Our diffusion bridge model offers a promising solution for\\nimproving neuroimaging datasets and supporting clinical decision-making, with\\nthe potential to significantly impact neuroimaging research and clinical\\npractice.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T17:49:06Z\"}"}
