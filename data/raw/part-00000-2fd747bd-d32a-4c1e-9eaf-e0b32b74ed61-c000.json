{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23880v1\", \"title\": \"Can a ferroelectric diode be a selector-less, universal, non-volatile\\n  memory?\", \"summary\": \"Recent advances in silicon foundry-process compatible ferroelectric (FE) thin\\nfilms have reinvigorated interest in FE-based non-volatile memory (NVM)\\ndevices. Ferroelectric diodes (FeDs) are two-terminal NVM devices exhibiting\\nrectifying current-voltage hysteretic characteristics that enable\\nself-selecting designs critical for high-density memory. We examine progress in\\nFeDs based on CMOS-compatible HZO, AlScN, and emerging van der Waals\\nferroelectrics. While FeDs demonstrate promising ON/OFF ratios and\\nrectification capabilities, they face persistent challenges including limited\\nwrite-cycling endurance, elevated operating voltages, and insufficient read\\ncurrents. We provide materials-focused strategies to enhance reliability and\\nperformance of FeDs for energy-efficient electronic memory applications, with\\nemphasis on their unique self-rectifying capabilities that eliminate the need\\nfor selector elements in crossbar arrays for compute in memory applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T09:29:57Z\"}"}
