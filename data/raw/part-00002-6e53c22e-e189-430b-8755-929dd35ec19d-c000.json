However, daytime dew-harvesting faces two key challenges as compared\\nto its nighttime counterpart: the high solar irradiance and the large contrast\\nbetween the ambient temperature and the dewpoint. To address these challenges\\nand guide the photonic design, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze\\ndew-harvesting in a 24-h day-night cycle. Using Nanjing as an example, our\\nanalyses reveal that, in the solar regime, a minimum average solar reflectivity\\nof 0.92 is required; in the infrared regime, a 10% reduction in absorptivity\\noutside the 8-13 um transparency window is equivalent to a 5.9% enhancement in\\nemissivity within the window. Guided by these findings, we propose a photonic\\ndesign, which, in a synthetic experiment with measured meteorological datasets,\\nachieves a water production rate of 313 g/m2-day, in which nearly 40% is\\ncontributed by daytime. This performance reaches approximately 70% of the\\ntheoretical maximum predicted using the ideal spectrum. We end by optimizing\\nthe layout of condensers in practical applications.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T16:33:11Z\"}"}
