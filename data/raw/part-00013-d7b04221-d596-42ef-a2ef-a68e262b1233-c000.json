In this work,\\nwe employ first-principles calculations to investigate the effects of strain on\\nthe magnetic and optical properties of 2D topological insulators MnBi$_2$X$_4$\\n(X = Te, Se, S). Our results indicate that biaxial strain enhances the Mn\\nmagnetic moment, while uniaxial strains reduce it. Significantly, the\\nstrain-dependent behavior, quantified through the quantum weight, can be\\nleveraged to control the system's quantum geometry and topological features.\\nParticularly, uniaxial strains reduce the quantum weight and introduce\\nanisotropy, thus providing an additional degree of freedom to tailor device\\nfunctionalities. Finally, by analyzing chemical bonds under various strain\\ndirections, we elucidate how the intrinsic ductile or brittle fracture behavior\\nof MnBi$_2$X$_4$ could impact fabrication protocols and structural stability.\\nThese insights pave the way for strain-based approaches to optimize the quantum\\nproperties in 2D magnetic topological insulators in practical device contexts.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T05:18:21Z\"}"}
