{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01751v1\", \"title\": \"Cyanine-Conjugated Gold Nanospheres for Near-infrared Fluorescence\", \"summary\": \"Near-infrared fluorescence imaging offers improved spatial precision by\\nreducing light scattering and absorption in tissue. Despite this key advantage,\\nthe NIR region is limited by the availability of fluorophores, most of which\\nexhibit relatively low quantum yield. In this study, gold nanospheres with\\nabsorption peaks in the visible range were used to enhance the fluorescence\\nintensity of the cyanine NIR fluorophore IRdye 800 in the first NIR window of\\nthe electromagnetic spectrum. AuNSs with diameters ranging from 5 to 25 nm were\\nchosen to investigate the impact of a nanoparticle size on fluorescence\\nenhancement, functionalized with polyethylene glycol of varying molecular\\nweights to optimize the distance between the fluorophore and the nanoparticle\\nsurface. Theoretical analyses using finite-difference time-domain simulations\\nand experimental comparisons with non-metallic nanoparticles were performed to\\nidentify the factors contributing to the enhancement of fluorescence. PEGylated\\nAuNSs conjugated with IRdye 800 (AuNDs) exhibited decreased photoisomerization,\\nresulting in increased fluorescence intensity and altered fluorescence\\nlifetimes. The observed enhancement in the fluorescence intensity of the AuNDs\\nwas attributed to three primary mechanisms: metal-enhanced fluorescence,\\naltered radiative decay rates, and steric stabilization. Among these three\\nmechanisms, two are attributed to the tail-end absorption spectral overlap of\\nthe AuNSs with IRdye 800. This study highlights the potential of AuNSs for\\nimproving NIR-I fluorescence imaging and opens up new possibilities for\\napplications in biomedical research.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T14:03:37Z\"}"}
