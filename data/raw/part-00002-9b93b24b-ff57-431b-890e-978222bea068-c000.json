Meanwhile, recent studies have shown that non-Hermiticity\\ngives rise to distinctive complex-energy gap structures, known as point gaps,\\nand associated topological phases with no analogs in Hermitian systems.\\nHowever, non-Hermitian counterparts of Hopf insulators have remained largely\\nelusive. Here, we generally classify topological phases of two-band\\nnon-Hermitian systems based on the homotopy theory and uncover Hopf-type\\npoint-gap topology present only for two bands. Specifically, we reveal such\\nHopf-type point-gap topology for three-dimensional systems with chiral symmetry\\n(class AIII) and four-dimensional systems with no symmetry (class A).\\nExplicitly constructing prototypical models from the Hermitian Hopf insulator,\\nwe further demonstrate that these non-Hermitian topological phases lead to\\nanomalous point-gapless boundary states spectrally detachable from the bulk\\nbands.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,math-ph,math.MP,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T14:57:46Z\"}"}
