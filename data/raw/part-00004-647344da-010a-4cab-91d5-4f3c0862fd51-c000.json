{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20724v1\", \"title\": \"Multipolar Angular Scattering of Substrated Metasurfaces\", \"summary\": \"Properly modeling and predicting the scattering response of a metasurface is\\na particularly challenging task. This has been shown to be especially difficult\\nif the metasurface supports both local and nonlocal interactions, in the form\\nof lattice coupling effects, multipolar contributions or bianisotropic\\nresponses. So far, existing methods to approach this problem have been\\nrestricted to normal incidence in a homogeneous background medium. We overcome\\nthese limitations by providing a rigorous and comprehensive formalism that\\naccommodates both oblique incidence and the presence of different superstrate\\nand substrate. This is achieved by extending our existing metasurface modeling\\nframework to account for nonlocal and multipolar contributions up to the\\noctupolar order and properly accounting for the scattering effects due to an\\ninhomogeneous background medium. Additionally, our method is based on exact\\nspherical multipole decomposition, which intrinsically accounts for toroidal\\ncontributions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by modeling the\\nresponse of several dielectric and plasmonic metasurfaces that exhibit sharp\\nspectral features including bound states in the continuum. Overall, our\\nformalism yields excellent agreement with full-wave simulations.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:03:42Z\"}"}
