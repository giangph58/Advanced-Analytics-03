Here we present the sizable SHE in CrN, a light element-based\\nsystem and demonstrate the current-induced magnetization switching in the\\nadjacent ferromagnetic layer [Co(0.35nm)/Pt(0.3nm)]3, which exhibits\\nperpendicular magnetic anisotropy. We found the switching current density of\\n2.6 MA/cm2. The first principles calculation gives the spin Hall conductivity\\n(SHC) to be 120 (hcross/e) S/cm due to intrinsic Berry curvature arising from\\nSOC induced band splitting near Fermi-energy. The theoretically calculated\\nintrinsic SHC is close to the experimental SHC extracted from second harmonic\\nHall measurement. We estimated spin Hall angle to be 0.09, demonstrating\\nefficient charge-to-spin conversion in CrN system.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T06:26:39Z\"}"}
