{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03539v1\", \"title\": \"Panoramic Out-of-Distribution Segmentation\", \"summary\": \"Panoramic imaging enables capturing 360{\\\\deg} images with an ultra-wide\\nField-of-View (FoV) for dense omnidirectional perception. However, current\\npanoramic semantic segmentation methods fail to identify outliers, and pinhole\\nOut-of-distribution Segmentation (OoS) models perform unsatisfactorily in the\\npanoramic domain due to background clutter and pixel distortions. To address\\nthese issues, we introduce a new task, Panoramic Out-of-distribution\\nSegmentation (PanOoS), achieving OoS for panoramas. Furthermore, we propose the\\nfirst solution, POS, which adapts to the characteristics of panoramic images\\nthrough text-guided prompt distribution learning. Specifically, POS integrates\\na disentanglement strategy designed to materialize the cross-domain\\ngeneralization capability of CLIP. The proposed Prompt-based Restoration\\nAttention (PRA) optimizes semantic decoding by prompt guidance and\\nself-adaptive correction, while Bilevel Prompt Distribution Learning (BPDL)\\nrefines the manifold of per-pixel mask embeddings via semantic prototype\\nsupervision. Besides, to compensate for the scarcity of PanOoS datasets, we\\nestablish two benchmarks: DenseOoS, which features diverse outliers in complex\\nenvironments, and QuadOoS, captured by a quadruped robot with a panoramic\\nannular lens system. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance of\\nPOS, with AuPRC improving by 34.25% and FPR95 decreasing by 21.42% on DenseOoS,\\noutperforming state-of-the-art pinhole-OoS methods. Moreover, POS achieves\\nleading closed-set segmentation capabilities.
