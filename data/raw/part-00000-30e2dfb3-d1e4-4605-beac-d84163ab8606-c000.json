{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03704v1\", \"title\": \"Multi-modal cascade feature transfer for polymer property prediction\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning approach called\\nmulti-modal cascade model with feature transfer for polymer property\\nprediction.Polymers are characterized by a composite of data in several\\ndifferent formats, including molecular descriptors and additive information as\\nwell as chemical structures. However, in conventional approaches, prediction\\nmodels were often constructed using each type of data separately. Our model\\nenables more accurate prediction of physical properties for polymers by\\ncombining features extracted from the chemical structure by graph convolutional\\nneural networks (GCN) with features such as molecular descriptors and additive\\ninformation. The predictive performance of the proposed method is empirically\\nevaluated using several polymer datasets. We report that the proposed method\\nshows high predictive performance compared to the baseline conventional\\napproach using a single feature.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ML\", \"categories\": \"stat.ML,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T17:24:43Z\"}"}
