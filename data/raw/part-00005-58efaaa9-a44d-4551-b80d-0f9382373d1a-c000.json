{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16635v1\", \"title\": \"Bridging Econometrics and AI: VaR Estimation via Reinforcement Learning\\n  and GARCH Models\", \"summary\": \"In an environment of increasingly volatile financial markets, the accurate\\nestimation of risk remains a major challenge. Traditional econometric models,\\nsuch as GARCH and its variants, are based on assumptions that are often too\\nrigid to adapt to the complexity of the current market dynamics. To overcome\\nthese limitations, we propose a hybrid framework for Value-at-Risk (VaR)\\nestimation, combining GARCH volatility models with deep reinforcement learning.\\nOur approach incorporates directional market forecasting using the Double Deep\\nQ-Network (DDQN) model, treating the task as an imbalanced classification\\nproblem. This architecture enables the dynamic adjustment of risk-level\\nforecasts according to market conditions. Empirical validation on daily\\nEurostoxx 50 data covering periods of crisis and high volatility shows a\\nsignificant improvement in the accuracy of VaR estimates, as well as a\\nreduction in the number of breaches and also in capital requirements, while\\nrespecting regulatory risk thresholds. The ability of the model to adjust risk\\nlevels in real time reinforces its relevance to modern and proactive risk\\nmanagement.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,q-fin.CP,q-fin.RM,q-fin.ST\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T11:54:22Z\"}"}
