These spaces are a new structure that provides a\\nunified parameter for the study of various functional spaces. The consideration\\nof grand spaces is especially important for the study of boundary conditions of\\nparameters and allows us to achieve new results in this area. The study of\\nboundary parameters in classical spaces is not always possible. In recent\\nyears, grand Lebesgue spaces and their generalizations have been widely studied\\nin problems of functional spaces. These spaces are generalizations of classical\\nLorentz and grand Lorentz spaces. The article defines grand anisotropic Lorentz\\nspaces, gives basic estimates in these spaces, proves embedding theorems, and\\nderives embedding theorems for parameters. The results obtained can play an\\nimportant role not only in theoretical, but also in applied problems.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T12:59:10Z\"}"}
