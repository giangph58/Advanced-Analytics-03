Although polymer informatics\\ntools have supported speedup, polymer simulation protocols continue to face\\nsignificant challenges: on-demand generation of realistic 3D atomic structures\\nthat respect the conformational diversity of polymer structures. Generative\\nalgorithms for 3D structures of inorganic crystals, bio-polymers, and small\\nmolecules exist, but have not addressed synthetic polymers. In this work, we\\nintroduce polyGen, the first latent diffusion model designed specifically to\\ngenerate realistic polymer structures from minimal inputs such as the repeat\\nunit chemistry alone, leveraging a molecular encoding that captures polymer\\nconnectivity throughout the architecture. Due to a scarce dataset of only 3855\\nDFT-optimized polymer structures, we augment our training with DFT-optimized\\nmolecular structures, showing improvement in joint learning between similar\\nchemical structures. We also establish structure matching criteria to benchmark\\nour approach on this novel problem. polyGen effectively generates diverse\\nconformations of both linear chains and complex branched structures, though its\\nperformance decreases when handling repeat units with a high atom count. Given\\nthese initial results, polyGen represents a paradigm shift in atomic-level\\nstructure generation for polymer science-the first proof-of-concept for\\npredicting realistic atomic-level polymer conformations while accounting for\\ntheir intrinsic structural flexibility.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CE\", \"categories\": \"cs.CE,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:26:00Z\"}"}
