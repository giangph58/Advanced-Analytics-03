Particular emphasis is given to\\nthe asymmetric-matter equation of state required for modeling neutron stars,\\nneutron-star mergers, and r-process nucleosynthesis. Recent analyses based on\\ncombining information obtained from nuclear theory, heavy-ion collisions and\\nastrophysical observations confine the obtained radii of the canonical\\n1.4-solar-mass neutron star to values between 12 km and 13 km. The remaining\\nuncertainty is primarily related to missing information in the density interval\\nbetween nuclear saturation density and about twice that value which, however,\\nis accessible with laboratory experiments.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,astro-ph.SR,nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T08:28:06Z\"}"}
