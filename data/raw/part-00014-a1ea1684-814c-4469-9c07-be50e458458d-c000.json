In this work, we conduct archival search for the optical\\ncounterpart of an IceCube triplet event using the data of Zwicky Transient\\nFacility. We develop a dedicated alert filtering system and validate the\\nperformance by following a blind analysis method. Applying this filtering\\nsystem to the data after the detections of the IceCube triplet event, we find\\nno transient candidates within the localization area. Assuming that the IceCube\\ntriplet event originates from an astrophysical source, we constrain parameters\\nof optical transient, a peak luminosity and a decay timescale, using a simple\\nsignal model that is motivated by TDEs and superluminous SNe (SLSNe). Assuming\\nthe case with no time lag between neutrino detections and optical peak, almost\\nentire parameter space of the known TDEs and SLSNe would be constrained. To\\ngive constraints on transients with a rapidly evolving light curve, quick\\nfollow-up observations for future neutrino multiplet events are crucial.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T05:36:26Z\"}"}
