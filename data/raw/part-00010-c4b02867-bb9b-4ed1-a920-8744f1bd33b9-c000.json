Our method extends the Griffiths--Dwork reduction technique to\\nholonomic systems and is implemented in Julia. While not yet outperforming\\ncreative telescoping in D-finite cases, it enhances computational capabilities\\nwithin the holonomic framework. As an application, we derive a previously\\nunattainable differential equation for the generating series of 8-regular\\ngraphs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SC\", \"categories\": \"cs.SC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T08:00:01Z\"}"}
