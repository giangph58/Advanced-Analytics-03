However, extracting detailed topological vessel network information\\nfrom microscopy data remains a significant challenge, mainly due to the\\nscarcity of labeled training data and the need for high topological accuracy.\\nThis work combines synthetic data generation with deep learning to\\nautomatically extract vessel networks as graphs from volumetric microscopy\\ndata. To combat data scarcity, we introduce a comprehensive pipeline for\\ngenerating large-scale synthetic datasets that mirror the characteristics of\\nreal vessel networks. Our three-stage approach progresses from abstract graph\\ngeneration through vessel mask creation to realistic medical image synthesis,\\nincorporating biological constraints and imaging artifacts at each stage. Using\\nthis synthetic data, we develop a two-stage deep learning pipeline of 3D\\nU-Net-based models for node detection and edge prediction. Fine-tuning on real\\nmicroscopy data shows promising adaptation, improving edge prediction F1 scores\\nfrom 0.496 to 0.626 by training on merely 5 manually labeled samples. These\\nresults suggest that automated vessel network extraction is becoming\\npractically feasible, opening new possibilities for large-scale vascular\\nanalysis in stroke research.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T08:29:46Z\"}"}
