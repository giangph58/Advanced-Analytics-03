Moreover, assuming the continuum hypothesis (CH), there is a\\nsubgroup $A$ of $\\\\mathbb{R}$ with $\\\\mathrm{dim_H} (A) = 0$ such that $x \\\\not\\\\in\\n\\\\mathbb{Q}$ if and only if $A + x A =\\\\mathbb{R}$ for all $x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$. A\\nkey ingredient in the proof of this theorem consists of some techniques in\\nrecursion theory and algorithmic randomness. We believe it may lead to\\napplications to other constructions of exotic sets of reals. Several other\\ntheorems on measurable, and especially Borel and analytic subgroups and\\nsubfields of the reals are presented. We also discuss some of these results in\\nthe $p$-adics.\", \"main_category\": \"math.LO\", \"categories\": \"math.LO,math.CA,math.GR,math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T14:31:57Z\"}"}
