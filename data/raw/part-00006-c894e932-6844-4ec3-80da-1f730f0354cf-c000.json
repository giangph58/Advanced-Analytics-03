We propose a robust\\nclassification method, named SSLDA, that is intended to withstand heavy-tailed\\ndistributions. We demonstrate that SSLDA achieves an optimal convergence rate\\nin terms of both misclassification rate and estimate error. Our theoretical\\nresults are further confirmed by extensive numerical experiments on both\\nsimulated and real datasets. Compared with current approaches, the SSLDA method\\noffers superior improved finite sample performance and notable robustness\\nagainst heavy-tailed distributions.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T12:04:56Z\"}"}
