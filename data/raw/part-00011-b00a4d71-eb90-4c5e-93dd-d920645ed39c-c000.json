{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10195v1\", \"title\": \"Simulation of TOPCon/PERC Hybrid Bottom Structure for Perovskite/Silicon\\n  Tandem Solar Cells using Quokka3\", \"summary\": \"This work emphasizes the potential of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells\\nfor increased power conversion efficiencies. By employing crystalline silicon\\n(c-Si) as the bottom cell, particularly with p-type PERC technology, there are\\ncost-effective and advantageous physical properties. However, traditional\\nphosphorus-doped emitters in PERC Si bottom cells are hindered by high surface\\nrecombination, which limits their performance. This research introduces a novel\\nhybrid PERC/TOPCon structure that integrates a phosphorus-doped poly-Si (n+\\nTOPCon) layer as the front emitter to address these challenges. Numerical\\nsimulations using Quokka3 confirmed the feasibility of the design, focusing on\\noptimizing the rear side metallization to enhance implied open-circuit voltage\\n(Voc) and fill factor (FF). A two-step process systematically varied local\\ncontact openings to examine their impact on performance metrics. Results\\nhighlighted optimal rear metallization parameters, achieving optimal metal\\nfractions approximately 2%. This innovative approach demonstrates the\\neffectiveness of combining TOPCon and PERC technologies for bottom cells in\\ntandem structures, providing valuable insights into their development and\\noptimization. The study underscores the potential of the hybrid PERC/TOPCon\\nstructure in enhancing the functionality and efficiency of perovskite/silicon\\ntandem solar cells.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T12:56:45Z\"}"}
