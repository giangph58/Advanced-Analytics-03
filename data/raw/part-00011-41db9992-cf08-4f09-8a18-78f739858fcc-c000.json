{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05444v1\", \"title\": \"The soft X-ray transient EP241021a: a cosmic explosion with a complex\\n  off-axis jet and cocoon from a massive progenitor\", \"summary\": \"X-Ray Flashes (XRFs) are fast X-ray transients discovered by the BeppoSAX\\nsatellite, showing an isotropic sky distribution and a prompt emission duration\\nbetween 10-1000 seconds. The observed prompt X-ray spectrum is similar to Gamma\\nRay Bursts (GRBs), but with a softer peak energy of the spectrum. Several\\npieces of evidence indicate that XRFs are connected to GRBs and likely\\nrepresent their softer analogues, but their origin is still unclear. Several\\nmodels have been proposed to explain the observed properties of XRF, mostly in\\nthe context of collapsar scenario, similar to GRBs but with different\\ngeometrical or physical conditions of the progenitor. These include off-axis\\nGRBs and baryon-loaded explosions, that either produce a low Lorentz factor jet\\nor a spherical mildly (or non-) relativistic ejecta, known as cocoons. In this\\npaper, we present multi-wavelength observations of the afterglow of EP241021a,\\na soft X-ray transient detected by EP, consistent with being an XRF. We present\\nthe results of our multiwavelength campaign from radio (uGMRT, ATCA, e-MERLIN,\\nALMA), optical (LBT, GTC, CAHA) and X-rays (EP-FXT). EP241021a afterglow is\\ncharacterized by multiple components. They represent the imprints of the\\ninteraction of a jet with the complex environment of the pre-existing\\nprogenitor, that is likely shaping its structure from a highly relativistic\\nnarrow cone to much broader and mildly relativistic cocoon components.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T17:35:31Z\"}"}
