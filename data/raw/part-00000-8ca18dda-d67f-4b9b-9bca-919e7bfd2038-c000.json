{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04618v1\", \"title\": \"Linear Thermal Instability of a Condensing Gas-Particle Mixture\", \"summary\": \"We study the stability of a hot saturated gas coexisting with condensed\\nparticles in an optically thin medium. Such a situation may obtain downstream\\nof a shock, at condensation fronts, or in vaporizing impacts. We show that the\\ngas-particle mixture is subject to a thermal instability whereby a region of\\nlower temperature and higher condensate density cools faster to condense\\nfaster. If the region of runaway condensation has a sound-crossing time shorter\\nthan its cooling time, then it accretes more mass, in gas and particles, from\\nits higher pressure surroundings. Numerical integration of the linearized\\nperturbation equations demonstrates that this radiation-condensation\\ninstability can create particle clumps and voids out of a secularly cooling\\ngas. Provided radiation can escape to cool particle overdensities, thermal\\ninstability can help assemble chondrite parent bodies out of the vaporized\\ndebris of asteroid collisions, and form planetesimals generally.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T17:59:14Z\"}"}
