In this paper, we\\ninvestigate this class of highly symmetric surface triangulations. We identify\\nseven types of such face-transitive surfaces, splitting up further into a total\\nof thirteen sub-types, distinguished by how their automorphism groups act on\\nthem. We use these theoretical results to compute a census of face-transitive\\nsurfaces with up to 1280 faces by constructing suitable cycle double covers of\\ncubic node-transitive graphs.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T09:52:10Z\"}"}
