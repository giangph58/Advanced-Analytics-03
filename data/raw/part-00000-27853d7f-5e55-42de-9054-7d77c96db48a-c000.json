For ${}^{78}$Y${}^{\\\\rm m}$,\\n${}^{84}$Mo, and ${}^{88}$Ru, their masses are experimentally determined for\\nthe first time with uncertainties of $\\\\delta m \\\\approx 20~{\\\\rm keV}$. The mass\\nprecision of ${}^{79}$Y and ${}^{83}$Nb is improved to 13 keV and 9.6 keV,\\nrespectively. The new $\\\\alpha$-separation energy of ${}^{84}$Mo, 1.434(83) MeV,\\nunambiguously rules out the possibility of forming the ZrNb cycle. The X-ray\\nburst simulation with the new masses shows that our measurements effectively\\nremove the large final abundance uncertainties in the $A=80-90$ mass region.\\nThe new mass values improve the prediction power for the composition of the\\nnuclear ashes in X-ray bursts, including the production of light $p$-nuclei.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-ex\", \"categories\": \"nucl-ex,astro-ph.HE,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T04:50:30Z\"}"}
