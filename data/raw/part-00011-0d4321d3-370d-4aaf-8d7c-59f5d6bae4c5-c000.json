[JHEP 03 (2025) 158]\\noriginally designed for the AdS4 Witten diagrams, we show that AdS3 Witten\\ndiagrams in position space in the flat space limit reduce to Carrollian\\namplitudes. The flat space limit in the bulk is implemented by the Carrollian\\nlimit at the boundary. Focusing on four-point correlators with contact and\\nexchange diagrams, we show that the Carrollian limit makes the universality of\\nthe bulk point singularity manifest upon performing analytic continuation to\\nthe Lorentzian signature of the boundary correlators. Unlike four-point\\nCarrollian amplitudes in (1+3) dimensions, the (1+2) dimensional ones are\\nnon-distributional, having analytic properties simpler than the AdS\\ncorrelators. We also observe for the first time a double copy structure of\\nCarrollian amplitudes.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T10:57:27Z\"}"}
