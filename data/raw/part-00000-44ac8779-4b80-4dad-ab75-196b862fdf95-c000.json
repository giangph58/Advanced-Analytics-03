{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15062v1\", \"title\": \"OPO: Making Decision-Focused Data Acquisition Decisions\", \"summary\": \"We propose a model for making data acquisition decisions for variables in\\ncontextual stochastic optimisation problems. Data acquisition decisions are\\ntypically treated as separate and fixed. We explore problem settings in which\\nthe acquisition of contextual variables is costly and consequently constrained.\\nThe data acquisition problem is often solved heuristically for proxy objectives\\nsuch as coverage. The more intuitive objective is the downstream decision\\nquality as a result of data acquisition decisions. The whole pipeline can be\\ncharacterised as an optimise-then-predict-then-optimise (OPO) problem.\\nAnalogously, much recent research has focused on how to integrate prediction\\nand optimisation (PO) in the form of decision-focused learning. We propose\\nleveraging differentiable optimisation to extend the integration to data\\nacquisition. We solve the data acquisition problem with well-defined\\nconstraints by learning a surrogate linear objective function. We demonstrate\\nan application of this model on a shortest path problem for which we first have\\nto set a drone reconnaissance strategy to capture image segments serving as\\ninputs to a model that predicts travel costs. We ablate the problem with a\\nnumber of training modalities and demonstrate that the differentiable\\noptimisation approach outperforms random search strategies.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T12:41:35Z\"}"}
