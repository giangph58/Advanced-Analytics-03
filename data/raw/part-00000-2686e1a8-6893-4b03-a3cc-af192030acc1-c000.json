We observed a strong correlation between growth temperature and\\ncrystalline quality, as reflected in both RRR values and lattice parameter\\nvariations. Characterization of superconductivity yielded a Ginzburg-Landau\\ncoherence length of 60.4 $\\\\pm$ 0.6 nm, significantly higher than typical\\nsputtered films, suggesting improved superconducting coherence.\\nFirst-principles calculations, in conjunction with experimental data, provided\\ndetailed insights into the electronic structure and transport properties of the\\nTiN films. Temperature-dependent Hall coefficient measurements further revealed\\nthe influence of anisotropic scattering mechanisms. These findings establish a\\npromising route for the development of nitride-based superconducting materials\\nfor advanced quantum computing technologies.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T10:57:14Z\"}"}
