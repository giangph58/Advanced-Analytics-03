{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12610v1\", \"title\": \"Machine Learning Methods for Gene Regulatory Network Inference\", \"summary\": \"Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) are intricate biological systems that control\\ngene expression and regulation in response to environmental and developmental\\ncues. Advances in computational biology, coupled with high throughput\\nsequencing technologies, have significantly improved the accuracy of GRN\\ninference and modeling. Modern approaches increasingly leverage artificial\\nintelligence (AI), particularly machine learning techniques including\\nsupervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and contrastive learning to analyze\\nlarge scale omics data and uncover regulatory gene interactions. To support\\nboth the application of GRN inference in studying gene regulation and the\\ndevelopment of novel machine learning methods, we present a comprehensive\\nreview of machine learning based GRN inference methodologies, along with the\\ndatasets and evaluation metrics commonly used. Special emphasis is placed on\\nthe emerging role of cutting edge deep learning techniques in enhancing\\ninference performance. The potential future directions for improving GRN\\ninference are also discussed.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,q-bio.MN\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T03:19:49Z\"}"}
