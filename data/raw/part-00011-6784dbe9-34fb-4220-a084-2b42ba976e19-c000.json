We argue that the communication challenge\\nbetween battery-free devices originates from the complete uncertainty of the\\nenvironment. FreeBeacon is built on the insight that by introducing just a\\nsmall degree of certainty into the system, the communication problem can be\\nlargely simplified. To this end, FreeBeacon first introduces a small number of\\nbattery-powered devices as beacons for battery-free devices. Then, FreeBeacon\\nfeatures protocols for battery-free devices to achieve interaction with the\\nbeacon and to perform communication efficiently following customized schedules\\nthat implement different data aggregation schemes while achieving resilience.\\nWe evaluate FreeBeacon with extensive prototype-based experiments and\\nsimulation studies. Results show that FreeBeacon can consistently achieve an\\norder of magnitude data aggregation efficiency when compared with the\\nstate-of-the-art approaches.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T12:17:04Z\"}"}
