{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16032v1\", \"title\": \"LLMs meet Federated Learning for Scalable and Secure IoT Management\", \"summary\": \"The rapid expansion of IoT ecosystems introduces severe challenges in\\nscalability, security, and real-time decision-making. Traditional centralized\\narchitectures struggle with latency, privacy concerns, and excessive resource\\nconsumption, making them unsuitable for modern large-scale IoT deployments.\\nThis paper presents a novel Federated Learning-driven Large Language Model\\n(FL-LLM) framework, designed to enhance IoT system intelligence while ensuring\\ndata privacy and computational efficiency. The framework integrates Generative\\nIoT (GIoT) models with a Gradient Sensing Federated Strategy (GSFS),\\ndynamically optimizing model updates based on real-time network conditions. By\\nleveraging a hybrid edge-cloud processing architecture, our approach balances\\nintelligence, scalability, and security in distributed IoT environments.\\nEvaluations on the IoT-23 dataset demonstrate that our framework improves model\\naccuracy, reduces response latency, and enhances energy efficiency,\\noutperforming traditional FL techniques (i.e., FedAvg, FedOpt). These findings\\nhighlight the potential of integrating LLM-powered federated learning into\\nlarge-scale IoT ecosystems, paving the way for more secure, scalable, and\\nadaptive IoT management solutions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.ET\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T16:56:59Z\"}"}
