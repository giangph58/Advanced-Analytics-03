We\\nproposed a modified version of the barotropic fluid with the EoS, $p=\\\\zeta _0\\n\\\\rho +\\\\zeta _1 \\\\rho \\\\left(t-t_0\\\\right){}^{-2 n}$, where $\\\\zeta_0$, $\\\\zeta_1$,\\n$t_0$ and $n$ are some constants. Our goal is to explore if this type of EoS\\nmight help explain the universe's development, concentrating on the scenario\\nwhere the universe bounces instead of singularities. Interestingly the generic\\nsolutions derived from our model are sufficiently adaptable to illustrate the\\nbounce scenario, cosmic inflation and late-time dark-energy behaviour. The\\nparameters $\\\\zeta_0$, $\\\\zeta_1$, $t_0$, and $n$ define the universe's phase in\\nthis non-singular solution. We investigated several elements of cosmic\\ndevelopment, including as the energy density, deceleration parameter, and\\nenergy conditions, in order to validate our model. Stability analysis showed\\nthat the perturbations approach to zero as the time evolves, indicating the\\nmodel is stable under scalar perturbation. Additionally, we looked at the\\nstatefinder diagnostics and Hubble flow dynamics to get more understanding of\\nthe model's dark energy and inflationary behaviour, respectively. Additionally,\\nwe conducted a study of the models' relevance to the observational datasets\\nfrom BAO, DESI and Pantheon+SH0ES.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:43:02Z\"}"}
