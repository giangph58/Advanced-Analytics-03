It is unclear if all passive galaxy populations\\nhost radio AGNs and if AGN feedback is a plausible mechanism for truncating or\\nregulating star formation in these galaxies. To determine if radio AGNs are\\ncommon in passive spiral galaxies, we have measured the radio emission of 38\\nlow-redshift passive spiral galaxies using RACS-low at 887.5 MHz and VLASS at 3\\nGHz. We selected a subset of 2MRS galaxies with negligible WISE 12 $\\\\mu$m\\nemission from warm dust, and spiral morphologies from HyperLeda, RC3, 2MRS and\\nmanual inspection. In contrast to comparable early-type galaxies, our sample\\nhas no significant radio detections, with radio flux densities below 1 mJy,\\nimplying that radio AGNs are rare or non-existent in passive spirals. Using the\\ncombined radio images and assuming radio luminosity is proportional to $K$-band\\nluminosity, we find ${\\\\rm log}~L_\\\\nu \\\\lesssim 9.01-0.4~M_K$. This falls below\\nthe radio luminosities of passive elliptical galaxies, implying radio\\nluminosity in passive galaxies is correlated with host galaxy morphology and\\nkinematics.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T09:07:10Z\"}"}
