{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12056v1\", \"title\": \"Refining the Understanding of Operator Size Dynamics in Open Quantum\\n  Systems\", \"summary\": \"Information scrambling refers to the phenomenon in which local quantum\\ninformation in a many-body system becomes dispersed throughout the entire\\nsystem under unitary evolution. It has been extensively studied in closed\\nquantum systems, where it is quantified by operator size growth, revealing deep\\nconnections between condensed matter physics, high-energy physics, and quantum\\ninformation. However, when extending the study of operator size dynamics to\\nopen quantum systems, two different definitions of operator size distributions\\nemerge. These definitions are based on different treatments of the bath. In\\nthis work, we aim to establish a unified picture for operator size dynamics in\\nopen quantum systems, using the solvable Brownian SYK models at generic system\\nsize. In particular, we provide the conditions under which the signature of\\nscrambling transition, discovered using one particular definition, appears in\\noperator size dynamics under the other definition. Additionally, we extend\\nprevious studies by exploring finite-size effects that are not captured by the\\nscramblon theory. Our results provide a refined understanding of operator size\\ndynamics in open quantum systems.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.str-el,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T13:10:15Z\"}"}
