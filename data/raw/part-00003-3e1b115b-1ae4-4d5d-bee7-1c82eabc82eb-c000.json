{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11796v1\", \"title\": \"Efficient spin-orbit torque driven magnetization switching of GdFe using\\n  phosphorus-implanted platinum layers\", \"summary\": \"The capability of the spin-orbit torque (SOT) generated via phenomena such as\\nthe spin Hall effect in heavy metals, in switching the magnetization of an\\nadjacent magnetic material, has been studied extensively over the last decade.\\nThe efficiency of SOT generation is commonly quantified in terms of the spin\\nHall angle {\\\\theta}_SH. In this work, we demonstrate experimentally that\\nimplanting platinum (Pt) with phosphorus (P), resulting in Pt (P) d, where d\\ndenotes the implantation dose, increases {\\\\theta}_SH by a factor of 7, from\\n0.06 (d = 0) to 0.43 (d = 10*10^16 ions/cm^2). The enhanced {\\\\theta}_SH, along\\nwith factors such as perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and resistivity, lead to\\nreduction of the critical current density for switching the perpendicular\\nmagnetization of ferrimagnetic rare earth-transition metal alloy Gd26Fe74, by a\\nfactor of nearly 27, from 4.0*1011 A/m^2 (d = 0) to 1.5*10^10 A/m^2 (d =\\n10*10^16 ions/cm^2). Further, the switching current density at zero thermal\\nfluctuations and thermal stability factor were evaluated and found to be\\n2.0*10^10 A/m^2 and 61.4 (d = 10*10^16 ions/cm^2), with the latter being\\nsufficiently above the required threshold for commercial memory applications.\\nOur results suggest that Pt (P) could be a strong candidate in realizing\\nefficient SOT driven magnetization switching leading to the development of\\nimproved memory and logic devices in the future.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T06:03:53Z\"}"}
