We propose procedures for generating photons in\\nthese modes as well as for their manipulation, entanglement, and detection.\\nEntanglement in Zernike modes is demonstrated analytically for the two-photon\\nstate produced via spontaneous parametric down-conversion. This entanglement\\narises from specific constraints on the mode indices of the expansion\\ncoefficients of the down-converted Zernike fields.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T10:18:39Z\"}"}
