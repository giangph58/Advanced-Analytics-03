In this article we\\nconstruct a vertex algebra $\\\\tilde{V}$, which is an extension of $V$ by a big\\ncentral vertex subalgebra identified with the algebra of functionals on the\\nspace of regular $\\\\mathfrak{g}$-connections $(d+A)$.\\n  The category of representations of $\\\\tilde{V}$ fibres over the set of\\nconnections, and the fibres should be viewed as $(d+A)$-twisted modules of $V$,\\ngeneralizing the familiar notion of $g$-twisted modules. In fact, another\\napplication of our result is that it proposes an explicit definition of\\n$(d+A)$-twisted modules of $V$ in terms of a twisted commutator formula, and we\\nfeel that this subject should be pursued further.\\n  Vertex algebras with big centers appear in practice as critical level or\\nlarge level limits of vertex algebras. I particular we have in mind limits of\\nthe generalized quantum Langlands kernel, in which case $G$ is the Langland\\ndual and $V$ is conjecturally the Feigin-Tipunin vertex algebra and the\\nextension $\\\\tilde{V}$ is conjecturally related to the Kac-DeConcini-Procesi\\nquantum group with big center. With the current article, we can give a uniform\\nand independent construction of these limits.\", \"main_category\": \"math.QA\", \"categories\": \"math.QA,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T10:14:12Z\"}"}
