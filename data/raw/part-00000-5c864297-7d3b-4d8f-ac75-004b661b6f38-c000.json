Our method leverages execution results\\nto select the most semantically consistent query from multiple candidates,\\nenabling smaller, cost-effective models to surpass computationally intensive\\nreasoning methods such as o1, o3-mini, and DeepSeek R1 while reducing inference\\ncost by as much as 30 times. It integrates effortlessly with existing models,\\noffering a practical and scalable pathway to state-of-the-art SQL generation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:43:36Z\"}"}
