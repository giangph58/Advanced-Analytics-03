{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10286v1\", \"title\": \"Characterizing LLM-driven Social Network: The Chirper.ai Case\", \"summary\": \"Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate the ability to simulate human\\ndecision-making processes, enabling their use as agents in modeling\\nsophisticated social networks, both offline and online. Recent research has\\nexplored collective behavioral patterns and structural characteristics of LLM\\nagents within simulated networks. However, empirical comparisons between\\nLLM-driven and human-driven online social networks remain scarce, limiting our\\nunderstanding of how LLM agents differ from human users. This paper presents a\\nlarge-scale analysis of Chirper.ai, an X/Twitter-like social network entirely\\npopulated by LLM agents, comprising over 65,000 agents and 7.7 million\\nAI-generated posts. For comparison, we collect a parallel dataset from\\nMastodon, a human-driven decentralized social network, with over 117,000 users\\nand 16 million posts. We examine key differences between LLM agents and humans\\nin posting behaviors, abusive content, and social network structures. Our\\nfindings provide critical insights into the evolving landscape of online social\\nnetwork analysis in the AI era, offering a comprehensive profile of LLM agents\\nin social simulations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SI\", \"categories\": \"cs.SI,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T14:53:31Z\"}"}
