In this paper, we\\ninvestigate rescuing leptogenesis in the ISS model with the help of non-Abelian\\nflavor symmetries which have the potential to explain the observed peculiar\\nneutrino mixing pattern: we first implement non-Abelian flavor symmetries to\\nnaturally enforce mass degeneracies among different pseudo-Dirac sterile\\nneutrino pairs and then break them in a proper way so that resonant\\nleptogenesis among different PD sterile neutrino pairs can arise, thus\\nenhancing the generated baryon asymmetry. To be specific, we have considered\\nthe following two well-motivated approaches for generating the tiny mass\\nsplittings among different PD sterile neutrino pairs: one approach makes use of\\nthe renormalization-group corrections to the sterile neutrino masses, while the\\nother approach invokes non-trivial flavor structure of the $\\\\mu^{}_{\\\\rm s}$\\nmatrix. For these two scenarios, we aim to explore the viability of\\nleptogenesis and to identify the conditions under which the observed baryon\\nasymmetry can be successfully reproduced.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T11:48:05Z\"}"}
