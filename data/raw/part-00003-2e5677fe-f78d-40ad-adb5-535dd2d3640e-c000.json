Towards Sensitivity and\\n  User Acceptance of Presence Questionnaires\", \"summary\": \"Presence is an important and widely used metric to measure the quality of\\nvirtual reality (VR) applications. Given the multifaceted and subjective nature\\nof presence, the most common measures for presence are questionnaires. But\\nthere is little research on their validity regarding specific presence\\ndimensions and their responsiveness to differences in perception among users.\\nWe investigated four presence questionnaires (SUS, PQ, IPQ, Bouchard) on their\\nresponsiveness to intensity variations of known presence dimensions and asked\\nusers about their consistency with their experience. Therefore, we created five\\nVR scenarios that were designed to emphasize a specific presence dimension. Our\\nfindings showed heterogeneous sensitivity of the questionnaires dependent on\\nthe different dimensions of presence. This highlights a context-specific\\nsuitability of presence questionnaires. The questionnaires' sensitivity was\\nfurther stated as lower than actually perceived. Based on our findings, we\\noffer guidance on selecting these questionnaires based on their suitability for\\nparticular use cases.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T12:18:05Z\"}"}
