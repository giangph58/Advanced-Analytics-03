The resulting \\\"Virtual VNA 3.1\\\" technique can\\nunambiguously estimate the full scattering matrix of a non-reciprocal, linear,\\npassive, time-invariant device under test (DUT) with $N$ monomodal ports using\\nan $N_\\\\mathrm{A}$-channel coherent wavefront generator and an\\n$N_\\\\mathrm{A}$-channel non-coherent detector, where $N_\\\\mathrm{A}<N$. Waves are\\ninjected and received only via a fixed set of $N_\\\\mathrm{A}$ \\\"accessible\\\" DUT\\nports while the remaining $N_\\\\mathrm{S}$ \\\"not-directly-accessible\\\" DUT ports\\nare terminated by a specific tunable load network. To resolve all ambiguities,\\nan additional modified setup is required in which waves are injected and\\nreceived via a known $2N_\\\\mathrm{A}$-port system connected to the DUT's\\naccessible ports. We experimentally validate our method for\\n$N_\\\\mathrm{A}=N_\\\\mathrm{S}=4$ considering a non-reciprocal eight-port circuit\\nas DUT. By eliminating the need for coherent detection, our work reduces the\\nhardware complexity which may facilitate applications to large-scale or\\nhigher-frequency systems. Additionally, our work provides fundamental insights\\ninto the minimal requirements to fully and unambiguously characterize a\\nnon-reciprocal DUT.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.app-ph,eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T05:42:51Z\"}"}
