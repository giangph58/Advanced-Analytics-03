This results in more difficulty to reach the equilibrium,\\ni.e., ultra-slow relaxation, which has been recently demonstrated. Meanwhile,\\nwe exam the randomness of the equilibrium time. It is found that near the\\n1st-PTL the equilibrium time is self-diverging, in contrast to the\\nnon-self-averaging near the critical point.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T06:08:53Z\"}"}
