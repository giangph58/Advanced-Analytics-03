{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09995v1\", \"title\": \"COUNTER: Cluster GCN based Energy Efficient Resource Management for\\n  Sustainable Cloud Computing Environments\", \"summary\": \"Cloud computing, thanks to the pervasiveness of information technologies,\\nprovides a foundational environment for developing IT applications, offering\\norganizations virtually unlimited and flexible computing resources on a\\npay-per-use basis. However, the large data centres where cloud computing\\nservices are hosted consume significant amounts of electricity annually due to\\nInformation and Communication Technology (ICT) components. This issue is\\nexacerbated by the increasing deployment of large artificial intelligence (AI)\\nmodels, which often rely on distributed data centres, thereby significantly\\nimpacting the global environment. This study proposes the COUNTER model,\\ndesigned for sustainable cloud resource management. COUNTER is integrated with\\ncluster graph neural networks and evaluated in a simulated cloud environment,\\naiming to reduce energy consumption while maintaining quality of service\\nparameters. Experimental results demonstrate improvements in resource\\nutilisation, energy consumption, and cost effectiveness compared to the\\nbaseline model, HUNTER, which employs a gated graph neural network aimed at\\nachieving carbon neutrality in cloud computing for modern ICT systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T08:58:34Z\"}"}
