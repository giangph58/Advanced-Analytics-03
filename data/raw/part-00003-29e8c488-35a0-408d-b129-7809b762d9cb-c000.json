However, realizing the full potential of AI in educational settings\\nnecessitates careful consideration of the quality, cognitive depth, and ethical\\nimplications of AI-generated materials. This paper synthesizes insights from\\nfour related studies to propose a comprehensive framework for enhancing\\nAI-driven educational tools. We integrate cognitive assessment frameworks\\n(Bloom's Taxonomy and SOLO Taxonomy), linguistic analysis of AI-generated\\nfeedback, and ethical design principles to guide the development of effective\\nand responsible AI tools. We outline a structured three-phase approach\\nencompassing cognitive alignment, linguistic feedback integration, and ethical\\nsafeguards. The practical application of this framework is demonstrated through\\nits integration into OneClickQuiz, an AI-powered Moodle plugin for quiz\\ngeneration. This work contributes a comprehensive and actionable guide for\\neducators, researchers, and developers aiming to harness AI's potential while\\nupholding pedagogical and ethical standards in educational content generation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T06:36:21Z\"}"}
