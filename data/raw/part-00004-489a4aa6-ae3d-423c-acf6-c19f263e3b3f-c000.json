Starting from\\nsingle-particle coordinates, a step-by-step derivation of the Shcr\\\\\\\"{o}dinger\\nequation in Jacobi coordinates is outlined. Laplace operators are explicitly\\ntransformed through the chain rule for multivariable calculus. The\\ntransformation of Faddeev equations from Jacobi coordinates to hyperspherical\\ncoordinates is elaborated upon. In all transformations (from single-particle\\ncoordinates to Jacobi coordinates, rotation between Jacobi coordinates and from\\nJacobi coordinates to hyperspherical coordinates) the determinant of the\\nJacobian matrix is computed to show how volume elements transform. The\\nprojection of Faddeev equations on a hyperspherical harmonics basis is\\nexplicitly carried out to obtain the coupled hyperradial equations that define\\nthe hyperspherical harmonics method.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,physics.ed-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T15:10:00Z\"}"}
