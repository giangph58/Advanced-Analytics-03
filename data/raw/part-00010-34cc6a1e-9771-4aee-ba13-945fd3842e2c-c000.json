{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06859v1\", \"title\": \"Antikaon condensed dense matter in neutron star with SU(3) flavour\\n  symmetry\", \"summary\": \"Observations of massive pulsars suggest that the central density of neutron\\nstars can exceed several times the nuclear saturation density, which is a\\nfavourable environment for the appearance of exotic states such as strange and\\nnon-strange baryons, meson condensates, and deconfined quark matter. The\\nantikaon condensate is the most studied and plausible candidate among meson\\ncondensates. However, little is known about the exact interaction mechanisms\\nbetween antikaons and mediator mesons. In this work, we aim to determine hadron\\ncouplings in the mesonic sector using SU(3) flavour symmetry. Among the three\\nkey parameters we calculate $\\\\theta_v$, the mixing angle between the octet\\nmeson $\\\\omega_8$ and the singlet meson $\\\\phi_1$; the ratio of the octet to\\nsinglet couplings $z$; and leave the weight factor that balances the symmetric\\nand antisymmetric couplings $\\\\alpha_v$ as a free parameter to explore its\\nimpact on the system. Using this approach, we derive the couplings for antikaon\\ninteractions with both singlet and octet mesons in the nonet vector meson\\nfamily and examine the corresponding implications for dense matter featuring\\nantikaon condensation. Our findings reveal that the equation of state for dense\\nmatter becomes progressively stiffer with increasing values of $\\\\alpha_v$,\\nwhich delays the onset of antikaon condensation and increases the maximum\\nachievable mass of neutron stars. This establishes a lower bound for $\\\\alpha_v$\\nthat is consistent with the observed minimum masses of pulsars.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:10:37Z\"}"}
