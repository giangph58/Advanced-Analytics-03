{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19985v1\", \"title\": \"Real-Time Imitation of Human Head Motions, Blinks and Emotions by Nao\\n  Robot: A Closed-Loop Approach\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces a novel approach for enabling real-time imitation of\\nhuman head motion by a Nao robot, with a primary focus on elevating human-robot\\ninteractions. By using the robust capabilities of the MediaPipe as a computer\\nvision library and the DeepFace as an emotion recognition library, this\\nresearch endeavors to capture the subtleties of human head motion, including\\nblink actions and emotional expressions, and seamlessly incorporate these\\nindicators into the robot's responses. The result is a comprehensive framework\\nwhich facilitates precise head imitation within human-robot interactions,\\nutilizing a closed-loop approach that involves gathering real-time feedback\\nfrom the robot's imitation performance. This feedback loop ensures a high\\ndegree of accuracy in modeling head motion, as evidenced by an impressive R2\\nscore of 96.3 for pitch and 98.9 for yaw. Notably, the proposed approach holds\\npromise in improving communication for children with autism, offering them a\\nvaluable tool for more effective interaction. In essence, proposed work\\nexplores the integration of real-time head imitation and real-time emotion\\nrecognition to enhance human-robot interactions, with potential benefits for\\nindividuals with unique communication needs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:01:54Z\"}"}
