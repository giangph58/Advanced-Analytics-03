{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05171v1\", \"title\": \"Pattern avoidance in revised ascent sequences\", \"summary\": \"Inspired by the definition of modified ascent sequences, we introduce a new\\nclass of integer sequences called revised ascent sequences. These sequences are\\ndefined as Cayley permutations where each entry is a leftmost occurrence if and\\nonly if it serves as an ascent bottom. We construct a bijection between ascent\\nsequences and revised ascent sequences by adapting the classic hat map, which\\ntransforms ascent sequences into modified ascent sequences. Additionally, we\\ninvestigate revised ascent sequences that avoid a single pattern, leading to a\\nwealth of enumerative results. Our main techniques include the use of\\nbijections, generating trees, generating functions, and the kernel method.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T12:18:12Z\"}"}
