However, the\\nmid-infrared spectral characteristics of N$_2$O ice in higher temperature\\nregions (90-110 K), changes in mid-infrared spectra during UV irradiation, and\\nthe chemical network of nitrogen oxide (N$_x$O$_y$) ices remain insufficiently\\nunderstood. This study aims to elucidate these aspects through in-situ\\nmid-infrared spectral measurements of cryogenic particles using two-dimensional\\nimaging Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.\\n  Spectroscopic imaging confirmed strong absorption at 7.75 $\\\\mu$m (N$_2$O\\n$\\\\nu_1$ vibrational mode), with weaker vibrational modes observed at 8.60\\n$\\\\mu$m (N$_2$O 2$\\\\nu_2$), 7.27 $\\\\mu$m (N$_2$O torsion), and 5.29 $\\\\mu$m (N$_2$O\\n$\\\\nu_1$+$\\\\nu_2$). Annealing experiments simulating high-temperature conditions\\ndemonstrated that all vibrational modes irreversibly intensified with\\nincreasing temperature, indicating progressive crystallization. New spectral\\nfeatures appeared at approximately 12 $\\\\mu$m and 14 $\\\\mu$m at the condensed\\nsample.\\n  N$_2$O ice was exposed to ultraviolet radiation (190-340 nm) using a D$_2$\\nlamp for 8.5 hours to investigate spectral changes during UV irradiation. After\\n60-90 minutes of irradiation, all N$_2$O vibrational modes disappeared, while\\nabsorption intensities of various nitrogen oxides, including NO, NO$_2$,\\nN$_2$O$_3$, and O$_3$ increased. Beyond 180 minutes, vibrational modes of\\nmultiple nitrogen oxide ices exhibited intensity variations across different\\nwavelengths, corresponding to other species such as cis-(NO)$_2$, N$_2$O$_4$,\\nand N$_2$O$_5$.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.IM,physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T02:03:25Z\"}"}
