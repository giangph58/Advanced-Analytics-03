We illustrate the fruitfulness of\\nthe account, relative to previous accounts, by showing that widely recognised\\nexplanatory virtues emerge naturally, as do subtle empirical patterns\\nconcerning the impact of norms on causal judgments. This shows the value of a\\ncommunication-first approach to explanation: getting clear on explanation's\\ncommunicative dimension is an important prerequisite for philosophical work on\\nexplanation. The result is a simple but powerful framework for incorporating\\ninsights from the cognitive sciences into philosophical work on explanation,\\nwhich will be useful for philosophers or cognitive scientists interested in\\nexplanation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MA\", \"categories\": \"cs.MA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T17:59:10Z\"}"}
