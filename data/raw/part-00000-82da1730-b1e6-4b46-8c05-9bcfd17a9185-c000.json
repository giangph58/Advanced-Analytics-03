Well above the\\nN\\\\'eel transition, the individual ferromagnetic layers are exchange decoupled\\nand resonate independently. As the temperature is lowered toward the N\\\\'eel\\npoint, the ferromagnetic proximity effect through the thin antiferromagnetic\\nspacers transforms the system into a weakly coupled macrospin chain along the\\nfilm normal, which exhibits pronounced standing spin-wave resonance modes,\\ncomparable in intensity to the uniform resonance in the ferromagnetic layers.\\nThese findings are supported by our micromagnetic simulations showing clear\\nspin-wave profiles with precessional phase lag along the macrospin chain. Well\\nbelow the N\\\\'eel transition, the FeMn layers order strongly\\nantiferromagnetically and exchange-pin the ferromagnetic layers to effectively\\nmake the multilayer one macrospin. The appearance and intensity of the\\nhigh-frequency spin-wave modes can thus be conveniently controlled by thermal\\ngating the multilayer. The nonlinearity in the microwave response of the\\ndemonstrated material can approach 100\\\\%, large compared to nonlinear materials\\nused in e.g. optics, with second-harmonic generation often at the single\\npercentage level.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T08:14:01Z\"}"}
