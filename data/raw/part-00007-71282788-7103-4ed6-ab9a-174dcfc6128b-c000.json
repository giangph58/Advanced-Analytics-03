{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12248v1\", \"title\": \"R\\u00e9nyi security framework against coherent attacks applied to\\n  decoy-state QKD\", \"summary\": \"We develop a flexible and robust framework for finite-size security proofs of\\nquantum key distribution (QKD) protocols under coherent attacks, applicable to\\nboth fixed- and variable-length protocols. Our approach achieves high\\nfinite-size key rates across a broad class of protocols while imposing minimal\\nrequirements. In particular, it eliminates the need for restrictive conditions\\nsuch as limited repetition rates or the implementation of virtual tomography\\nprocedures. To achieve this goal, we introduce new numerical techniques for the\\nevaluation of sandwiched conditional R\\\\'enyi entropies. In doing so, we also\\nfind an alternative formulation of the \\\"QKD cone\\\" studied in previous work. We\\nillustrate the versatility of our framework by applying it to several\\npractically relevant protocols, including decoy-state protocols. Furthermore,\\nwe extend the analysis to accommodate realistic device imperfections, such as\\nindependent intensity and phase imperfections. Overall, our framework provides\\nboth greater scope of applicability and better key rates than existing\\ntechniques, especially for small block sizes, hence offering a scalable path\\ntoward secure quantum communication under realistic conditions\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T16:54:23Z\"}"}
