Precisely, we obtain the uniqueness of equilibrium states for a\\nfamily of non-uniformly expansive flows by generalizing Climenhaga-Thompson's\\norbit decomposition criteria. In particular, such family includes entropy\\nexpansive flows. Meanwhile, the essential part of the decomposition is allowed\\nto satisfy an even weaker version of specification, namely controlled\\nspecification, thus also extends the corresponding results by Pavlov.\\n  Two applications of our abstract theorems are explored. Firstly, we introduce\\na notion of regularity condition called weak Walters condition, and study the\\nuniqueness of measure of maximal entropy for a suspension flow with roof\\nfunction satisfying such condition. Secondly, we investigate topologically\\ntransitive frame flows on rank one manifolds of nonpositive curvature, which is\\na group extension of nonuniformly hyperbolic flows. Under a bunched curvature\\ncondition and running a Gauss-Bonnet type of argument, we show the uniqueness\\nof equilibrium states with respect to certain potentials.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T07:22:00Z\"}"}
