{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00507v1\", \"title\": \"HeAL3D: Heuristical-enhanced Active Learning for 3D Object Detection\", \"summary\": \"Active Learning has proved to be a relevant approach to perform sample\\nselection for training models for Autonomous Driving. Particularly, previous\\nworks on active learning for 3D object detection have shown that selection of\\nsamples in uncontrolled scenarios is challenging. Furthermore, current\\napproaches focus exclusively on the theoretical aspects of the sample selection\\nproblem but neglect the practical insights that can be obtained from the\\nextensive literature and application of 3D detection models. In this paper, we\\nintroduce HeAL (Heuristical-enhanced Active Learning for 3D Object Detection)\\nwhich integrates those heuristical features together with Localization and\\nClassification to deliver the most contributing samples to the model's\\ntraining. In contrast to previous works, our approach integrates heuristical\\nfeatures such as object distance and point-quantity to estimate the\\nuncertainty, which enhance the usefulness of selected samples to train\\ndetection models. Our quantitative evaluation on KITTI shows that HeAL presents\\ncompetitive mAP with respect to the State-of-the-Art, and achieves the same mAP\\nas the full-supervised baseline with only 24% of the samples.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T13:24:55Z\"}"}
