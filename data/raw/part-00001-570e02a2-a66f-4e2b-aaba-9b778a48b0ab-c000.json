We show that very competitive luminosities could\\nbe reached for high energy $e^+e^-$ colliders. A first set of parameters was\\ndeveloped for a Higgs Factory indicating that such a scheme is indeed\\npotentially feasible. There are clearly many challenges to the development of\\nthis scheme, including novel RF acceleration modules and high precision and\\nstrong magnets for the proton driver. Challenges in the plasma acceleration\\nstage include the ability to accelerate positrons while maintaining necessary\\nemittance and the energy transfer efficiency from the driver to the witness.\\nSince many exciting applications would become available from our approach, its\\ndevelopment should be pursued.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.acc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.acc-ph,hep-ex,physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T16:36:33Z\"}"}
