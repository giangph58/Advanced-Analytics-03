{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15084v1\", \"title\": \"Reconfiguration and Real-Time Operation of Networked Microgrids Under\\n  Load Uncertainty\", \"summary\": \"Distribution networks are increasingly exposed to threats such as extreme\\nweather, aging infrastructure, and cyber risks--resulting in more frequent\\ncontingencies and outages, a trend likely to persist. Microgrids, particularly\\ndynamic networked microgrids (DNMGs), offer a promising solution to mitigate\\nthe impacts of such contingencies and enhance resiliency. However, distribution\\nnetworks present unique challenges due to their unbalanced nature and the\\ninherent uncertainty in both loads and generation. This paper builds upon our\\nprior work on the two-stage mixed-integer robust optimization problem for\\nconfiguring DNMGs, improving the solve time and scalability. Furthermore, we\\nintroduce a model-free, real-time optimal power flow algorithm to manage DNMG\\noperations in the time between reconfigurations. A case study on a realistic\\nnetwork based on part of the San Francisco Bay Area demonstrates the\\nscalability of both approaches. The case study also illustrates the ability to\\nmaintain power flow feasibility as loads vary and operating conditions change\\nwhen the methods are used in tandem.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T13:16:28Z\"}"}
