For numerical simulation of\\nsuch coupled problems in applications, robust and efficient computational\\nalgorithms are needed. In this work, we consider a generalization of the\\nBeavers-Joseph interface condition recently developed using homogenization and\\nboundary layer theory. This extension is applicable not only for the parallel\\nflows to the fluid-porous interface as its predecessor, but also for arbitrary\\nflow directions. To solve the Stokes-Darcy problem with these generalized\\ninterface conditions efficiently, we develop and analyze a Robin-Robin domain\\ndecomposition method using Fourier analysis to identify optimal weights in the\\nRobin interface conditions. We study efficiency and robustness of the proposed\\nmethod and provide numerical simulations which confirm the obtained theoretical\\nresults.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T14:48:28Z\"}"}
