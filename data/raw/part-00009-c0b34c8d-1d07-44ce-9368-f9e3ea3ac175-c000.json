His\\nargument and later developments by Clauser et al. effectively rely on gaps\\nbetween the anticorrelations achievable by classical models and quantum theory\\nfor projective measurements along randomly chosen axes separated by a fixed\\nangle. However, the size of these gaps has to date remained unknown. Here we\\nnumerically determine the LHV models maximizing anticorrelations for random\\naxes separated by any fixed angle, by mapping the problem onto ground state\\nconfigurations of fixed-range spin models. We identify angles where this gap is\\nlargest and thus best suited for Bell tests. These findings enrich the\\nunderstanding of Bell non-locality as a physical resource in quantum\\ninformation theory and quantum cryptography.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:24:32Z\"}"}
