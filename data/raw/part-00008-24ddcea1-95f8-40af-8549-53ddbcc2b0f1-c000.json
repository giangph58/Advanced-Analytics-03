{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05969v1\", \"title\": \"Extension of derivations to forms\", \"summary\": \"The problem of extending derivations of a field $F$ to an $F-$algebra $B$ is\\nwidely studied in commutative algebra and non-commutative ring theory. For\\nexample, every derivation of $F$ extends to $B$ if $B$ is a separable algebraic\\nextension or a central simple algebra over $F.$ We unify and generalize these\\nresults by showing that a derivation $d$ of $F$ with the field of constants $C$\\nextends to a finite dimensional algebra $B$ if $B$ is a form of some\\n$C-$algebra having a smooth automorphism scheme $\\\\rm G$. Furthermore, we show\\nthat the set of derivations of $B$ that extend the derivation $d$ of $F$ is in\\nbijection with the set of derivations $\\\\delta$ such that $(Y,\\\\delta)$ is a\\ndifferential $\\\\rm G_F-$torsor where $Y$ is the $\\\\rm G_F-$torsor corresponding\\nto $B$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RA\", \"categories\": \"math.RA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:26:52Z\"}"}
