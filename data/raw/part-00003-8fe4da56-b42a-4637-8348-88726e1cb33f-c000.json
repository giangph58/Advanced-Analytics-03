The noise is\\nspace-dependent and statistically translation-invariant. We show that, for\\nsmall forcing, solitons remain close to the family of traveling waves in a\\nweighted Sobolev norm, with high probability. We study the effective dynamics\\nof the soliton amplitude and position via their variational phase, for which we\\nderive explicit modulation equations. The stability result holds on a time\\nscale where the deterministic forcing induces significant amplitude modulation.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T09:58:03Z\"}"}
