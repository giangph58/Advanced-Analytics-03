We study how existence of\\nminimizers depends on the coupling constant, and find that there is a critical\\ninteraction strength needed for the minimizers to exist, both in dimensions two\\nand three. In $d=3$, a minimizer exists also at the critical coupling but none\\ndo in $d=2$ under suitable assumptions on the potential. We also establish the\\nexistence of non--minimizing critical points in $d=3$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T15:52:10Z\"}"}
