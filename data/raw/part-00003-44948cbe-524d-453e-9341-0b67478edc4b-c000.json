In the generalized TDGCM, the\\ncorrelated nuclear wave function is represented as a coherent superposition of\\ntime-dependent DFT trajectories. In the first realistic application, a large\\nbasis of 25 TDDFT trajectories is employed to calculate the charge yields and\\ntotal kinetic energy distribution for the fission of $^{240}$Pu. The results\\nare compared with available data, and with those obtained using a standard\\nTDDFT, that does not consider quantum fluctuations, and the adiabatic TDGCM+GOA\\n(Gaussian overlap approximation). It is shown that fragment yields and kinetic\\nenergies can simultaneously be described in a consistent microscopic framework\\nthat includes fluctuations in the collective degrees of freedom and the\\none-body dissipation mechanism.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T06:42:56Z\"}"}
