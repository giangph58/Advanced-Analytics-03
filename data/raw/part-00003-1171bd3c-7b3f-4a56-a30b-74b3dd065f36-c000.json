Among these, nonlocal versions of the classical\\nLaplace operator have attracted the most attention, while higher-order nonlocal\\noperators have been studied far less. In this work, we focus on the nonlocal\\ncounterpart of the classical biharmonic operator together with clamped boundary\\ncondition ($u$ and $\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial n}$ are given on boundary). We\\ndevelop the variational formulation of a nonlocal biharmonic model, establish\\nthe existence and uniqueness of its solution, and analyze its convergence as\\nthe nonlocal horizon approaches zero. In addition, numerical experiments are\\npresented to further illustrate the analytical properties of the model and its\\nsolution.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T03:45:47Z\"}"}
