This function arises from a\\nsuitable combinatorial Hopf algebra on digraphs, which made it possible to\\nassign the Redei-Berge function to posets. In this paper, we define a new\\ncombinatorial Hopf algebra of posets whose character is a close cousin of the\\nRedei-Berge character for posets. Further, we investigate the properties of the\\nsymmetric function that arises from this algebra and explore its expansions in\\nvarious natural bases of $QSym$ and $Sym$. Finally, we obtain an interesting\\nmethod for decomposing a poset.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:43:50Z\"}"}
