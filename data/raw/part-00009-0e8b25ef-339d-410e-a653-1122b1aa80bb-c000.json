{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15770v1\", \"title\": \"Multi-Scale Tensorial Summation and Dimensional Reduction Guided Neural\\n  Network for Edge Detection\", \"summary\": \"Edge detection has attracted considerable attention thanks to its exceptional\\nability to enhance performance in downstream computer vision tasks. In recent\\nyears, various deep learning methods have been explored for edge detection\\ntasks resulting in a significant performance improvement compared to\\nconventional computer vision algorithms. In neural networks, edge detection\\ntasks require considerably large receptive fields to provide satisfactory\\nperformance. In a typical convolutional operation, such a large receptive field\\ncan be achieved by utilizing a significant number of consecutive layers, which\\nyields deep network structures. Recently, a Multi-scale Tensorial Summation\\n(MTS) factorization operator was presented, which can achieve very large\\nreceptive fields even from the initial layers. In this paper, we propose a\\nnovel MTS Dimensional Reduction (MTS-DR) module guided neural network,\\nMTS-DR-Net, for the edge detection task. The MTS-DR-Net uses MTS layers, and\\ncorresponding MTS-DR blocks as a new backbone to remove redundant information\\ninitially. Such a dimensional reduction module enables the neural network to\\nfocus specifically on relevant information (i.e., necessary subspaces).\\nFinally, a weight U-shaped refinement module follows MTS-DR blocks in the\\nMTS-DR-Net. We conducted extensive experiments on two benchmark edge detection\\ndatasets: BSDS500 and BIPEDv2 to verify the effectiveness of our model. The\\nimplementation of the proposed MTS-DR-Net can be found at\\nhttps://github.com/LeiXuAI/MTS-DR-Net.git.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T10:28:10Z\"}"}
