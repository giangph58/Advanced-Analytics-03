These processes represent natural high-order quantum electrodynamics\\n(QED) effects that occur independently of inter-atomic interactions. A\\ncharacteristic length scale emerges, governing the physical range over which\\nthese phenomena manifest. We propose experiments to demonstrate the fundamental\\naspects of these collective QED processes.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph,cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T07:52:46Z\"}"}
