{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12986v1\", \"title\": \"Large global solutions to the Oldroyd-B model with dissipation\", \"summary\": \"In the first part of this work, we investigate the Cauchy problem for the\\n$d$-dimensional incompressible Oldroyd-B model with dissipation in the stress\\ntensor equation. By developing a weighted Chemin-Lerner framework combined with\\na refined energy argument, we prove the existence and uniqueness of global\\nsolutions for the system under a mild constraint on the initial velocity field,\\nwhile allowing a broad class of large initial data for the stress tensor.\\nNotably, our analysis accommodates general divergence-free initial stress\\ntensors ( $\\\\mathrm{div}\\\\tau_0=0$) and significantly relaxes the requirements on\\ninitial velocities compared to classical fluid models. This stands in sharp\\ncontrast to the finite-time singularity formation observed in the\\nincompressible Euler equations, even for small initial data, thereby\\nhighlighting the intrinsic stabilizing role of the stress tensor in polymeric\\nfluid dynamics.\\n  The second part of this paper focuses on the small-data regime. Through a\\nsystematic exploitation of the perturbative structure of the system, we\\nestablish global well-posedness and quantify the long-time behavior of\\nsolutions in Sobolev spaces\\n  $H^3(\\\\mathbb{T}^d)$. Specifically, we derive exponential decay rates for\\nperturbations, demonstrating how the dissipative mechanisms inherent to the\\nOldroyd-B model govern the asymptotic stability of the system.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T14:48:42Z\"}"}
