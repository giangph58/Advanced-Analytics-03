We investigate, in\\nparticular, the effects of the cubic term on the spectral index $n_s$ and the\\ntensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. Through both analytical and numerical analyses, we\\nshow that the $R^3$-corrected Starobinsky-Higgs model can achieve compatibility\\nwith cosmic microwave background observations while producing distinct\\nobservational signatures with different frequency ranges. In addition, we\\ndiscuss the complementarity between different observational probes, including\\nthe scalar-induced gravitational waves and spectral distortions, offering an\\nindependent probe of the enhanced curvature perturbations. Detection prospects\\nare also discussed.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T12:49:39Z\"}"}
