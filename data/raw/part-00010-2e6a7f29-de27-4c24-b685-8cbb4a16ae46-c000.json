{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07902v1\", \"title\": \"Biased domain walls: faster annihilation, weaker gravitational waves\", \"summary\": \"We study the evolution of domain wall networks and their phenomenological\\nimplications in a model of a real scalar $\\\\chi$, where a $Z_2$-symmetry is\\nslightly broken by a potential bias $V_{bias}$. It is demonstrated that the\\nlatter triggers domain wall annihilation considerably earlier than previously\\nthought. Namely, we observe that the scaling relation $t_{ann} \\\\propto\\n1/V^{2/3}_{bias}$ for the annihilation time $t_{ann}$ fits to the simulation\\ndata better than a commonly assumed $t_{ann} \\\\propto 1/V_{bias}$. As a result,\\nthe energy density of gravitational waves produced by the network of biased\\ndomain walls, for a given tiny $V_{bias}$, is suppressed compared to naive\\nexpectations. The spectral shape of gravitational waves is similar to that\\nresulting from unbiased domain walls, but with more power in the\\nclose-to-maximum ultraviolet part. In the far ultraviolet region, the spectrum\\nof gravitational waves becomes nearly flat; such a plateau has been recognized\\nearlier in the case of unbiased walls. In our investigation we mainly focus on\\nthe symmetry breaking potential $V_{breaking} \\\\propto \\\\chi^3$, and argue that\\nno significant modifications of the domain walls evolution take place if one\\nincludes higher powers of $\\\\chi$.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,astro-ph.CO,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T16:26:08Z\"}"}
