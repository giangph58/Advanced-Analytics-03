{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01505v1\", \"title\": \"In-situ compression and shape recovery of Ceramic single grain\\n  micro-pillar\", \"summary\": \"Most ceramic materials are known for high fracture toughness while reacting\\nhighly brittle to physical deformation. Some advancements were made by\\nutilizing the transformation toughening effect of Yttria-doped Zirconia.\\nHowever, finding a ceramic material demonstrating an effect analogous to the\\nShape Memory Effect (SME) in certain metals, that also allows for superelastic\\nresponses, remains a challenge. The underlying mechanism for SME and\\nsuperelasticity is based on crystallographic variations within the material's\\ngrains, requiring sophisticated electron microscopy techniques for direct\\nobservation. The combination of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with\\nfocused ion beam (FIB) milling, a Kleindiek Nanotechnik GmbH micro-manipulator\\nwith a 1.5 $\\\\mu$m diamond tip, and the ability to achieve in-situ heating up to\\n450 {\\\\deg}C on a Kleindiek heating stage provides a robust platform for the\\npreparation, deformation, and heating of micro-pillars made from ceramic\\nmaterials. This setup enabled us to conduct detailed studies on the\\nZirconia-based ceramic, observing permanent deformation exceeding 4% strain,\\nfollowed by shape recovery at 370 {\\\\deg}C. The paper provides outlines the key\\nexperimental steps that facilitated these observations.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:55:27Z\"}"}
