As the EU moves toward\\nenforcing binding obligations for GPAI model providers, the Code of Practice\\nwill be key to bridging legal requirements with concrete technical commitments.\\nOur analysis focuses on the draft's Safety and Security section which is only\\nrelevant for the providers of the most advanced models (Commitments II.1-II.16)\\nand excerpts from current public-facing documents quotes that are relevant to\\neach individual measure.\\n  We systematically reviewed different document types - including companies'\\nfrontier safety frameworks and model cards - from over a dozen companies,\\nincluding OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and\\nothers. This report is not meant to be an indication of legal compliance nor\\ndoes it take any prescriptive viewpoint about the Code of Practice or\\ncompanies' policies. Instead, it aims to inform the ongoing dialogue between\\nregulators and GPAI model providers by surfacing evidence of precedent.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T15:44:01Z\"}"}
