{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21795v1\", \"title\": \"Balancing Interpretability and Flexibility in Modeling Diagnostic\\n  Trajectories with an Embedded Neural Hawkes Process Model\", \"summary\": \"The Hawkes process (HP) is commonly used to model event sequences with\\nself-reinforcing dynamics, including electronic health records (EHRs).\\nTraditional HPs capture self-reinforcement via parametric impact functions that\\ncan be inspected to understand how each event modulates the intensity of\\nothers. Neural network-based HPs offer greater flexibility, resulting in\\nimproved fit and prediction performance, but at the cost of interpretability,\\nwhich is often critical in healthcare. In this work, we aim to understand and\\nimprove upon this tradeoff. We propose a novel HP formulation in which impact\\nfunctions are modeled by defining a flexible impact kernel, instantiated as a\\nneural network, in event embedding space, which allows us to model large-scale\\nevent sequences with many event types. This approach is more flexible than\\ntraditional HPs yet more interpretable than other neural network approaches,\\nand allows us to explicitly trade flexibility for interpretability by adding\\ntransformer encoder layers to further contextualize the event embeddings.\\nResults show that our method accurately recovers impact functions in\\nsimulations, achieves competitive performance on MIMIC-IV procedure dataset,\\nand gains clinically meaningful interpretation on XX-EHR with children\\ndiagnosis dataset even without transformer layers. This suggests that our\\nflexible impact kernel is often sufficient to capture self-reinforcing dynamics\\nin EHRs and other data effectively, implying that interpretability can be\\nmaintained without loss of performance.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ML\", \"categories\": \"stat.ML,cs.LG,stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T16:52:43Z\"}"}
