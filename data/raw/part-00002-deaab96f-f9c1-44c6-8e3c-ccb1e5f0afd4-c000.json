As the foundation of orbitronics, understanding how orbital\\ncurrents propagate and convert into charge currents is essential - but remains\\nelusive due to the challenge in disentangling orbital and spin dynamics in\\nultrathin films. Although orbital currents have been predicted to propagate\\nover long distances in materials, recent theoretical studies argue that lattice\\nsymmetry may constrain their mean free paths (MFPs) to the scale of a single\\natomic layer. In this work, we provide the first direct experimental evidence\\nfor ultrashort orbital MFPs in heavy metals (HMs) - W, Ta, Pt - revealed by\\nfemtosecond terahertz emission spectroscopy. This is enabled by\\nsub-nanometer-precision control of thin-film thickness using wedge-shaped HM|Ni\\nheterostructures. By employing a multi-component terahertz-emission model, we\\nquantitatively extract the orbital MFPs, consistently finding them shorter than\\ntheir spin counterparts. Furthermore, control experiments rule out interfacial\\norbital-to-charge conversion as the dominant mechanism, confirming that the\\nprocess is governed by the bulk inverse orbital Hall effect. Our findings\\nresolve a central controversy in orbitronics and provide key insights into\\norbital transport and conversion mechanisms.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.mes-hall,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T03:15:36Z\"}"}
