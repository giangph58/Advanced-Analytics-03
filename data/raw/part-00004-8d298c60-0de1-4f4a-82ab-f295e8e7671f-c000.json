{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11231v1\", \"title\": \"Emergent Magnetic Structures at the 2D Limit of the Altermagnet MnTe\", \"summary\": \"MnTe has recently emerged as a canonical altermagnet, a newly identified\\nclass of magnetism characterized by compensated antiferromagnetic order\\ncoexisting with spin-split electronic bands, traditionally considered exclusive\\nto ferromagnets. However, the extent to which altermagnetism persists as\\naltermagnets are thinned to the two-dimensional (2D) limit remains unexplored.\\nHere, we investigate the magnetic behaviour of 2D MnTe, specifically\\natomically-thin monolayers (MLs) and bilayers (BLs) grown on graphene/Ir(111)\\nsubstrate, by combining experimental scanning tunneling microscopy, x-ray\\nphotoelectron spectroscopy, x-ray absorption spectroscopy and x-ray magnetic\\ncircular dichroism with density functional theory calculations. We find that\\nwhile ML and BL MnTe adopt atomic structures with symmetries incompatible with\\naltermagnetism, they exhibit intriguing magnetic phases: the BL forms a\\nhighly-robust layered antiferromagnet with in-plane spin anisotropy, whereas\\nthe ML exhibits a spin-glass-like behavior below its freezing temperature, a\\nphenomenon not previously observed in an atomically thin material. These\\nfindings highlight how reduced dimensionality can promote the emergence of\\nunusual magnetic structures distinct from those of their three-dimensional\\ncounterparts, providing new insights into low-dimensional magnetism.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:30:28Z\"}"}
