{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05288v1\", \"title\": \"PlaceIt3D: Language-Guided Object Placement in Real 3D Scenes\", \"summary\": \"We introduce the novel task of Language-Guided Object Placement in Real 3D\\nScenes. Our model is given a 3D scene's point cloud, a 3D asset, and a textual\\nprompt broadly describing where the 3D asset should be placed. The task here is\\nto find a valid placement for the 3D asset that respects the prompt. Compared\\nwith other language-guided localization tasks in 3D scenes such as grounding,\\nthis task has specific challenges: it is ambiguous because it has multiple\\nvalid solutions, and it requires reasoning about 3D geometric relationships and\\nfree space. We inaugurate this task by proposing a new benchmark and evaluation\\nprotocol. We also introduce a new dataset for training 3D LLMs on this task, as\\nwell as the first method to serve as a non-trivial baseline. We believe that\\nthis challenging task and our new benchmark could become part of the suite of\\nbenchmarks used to evaluate and compare generalist 3D LLM models.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:29:11Z\"}"}
