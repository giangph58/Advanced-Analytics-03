{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05467v1\", \"title\": \"StreamBridge: Turning Your Offline Video Large Language Model into a\\n  Proactive Streaming Assistant\", \"summary\": \"We present StreamBridge, a simple yet effective framework that seamlessly\\ntransforms offline Video-LLMs into streaming-capable models. It addresses two\\nfundamental challenges in adapting existing models into online scenarios: (1)\\nlimited capability for multi-turn real-time understanding, and (2) lack of\\nproactive response mechanisms. Specifically, StreamBridge incorporates (1) a\\nmemory buffer combined with a round-decayed compression strategy, supporting\\nlong-context multi-turn interactions, and (2) a decoupled, lightweight\\nactivation model that can be effortlessly integrated into existing Video-LLMs,\\nenabling continuous proactive responses. To further support StreamBridge, we\\nconstruct Stream-IT, a large-scale dataset tailored for streaming video\\nunderstanding, featuring interleaved video-text sequences and diverse\\ninstruction formats. Extensive experiments show that StreamBridge significantly\\nimproves the streaming understanding capabilities of offline Video-LLMs across\\nvarious tasks, outperforming even proprietary models such as GPT-4o and Gemini\\n1.5 Pro. Simultaneously, it achieves competitive or superior performance on\\nstandard video understanding benchmarks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI,cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T17:57:40Z\"}"}
