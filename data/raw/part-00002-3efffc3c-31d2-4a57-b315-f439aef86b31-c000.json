{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10477v1\", \"title\": \"Vector induced Gravitational Waves sourced by Primordial Magnetic Fields\", \"summary\": \"In this work, we develop a generic formalism for the study of tensor\\nperturbations induced at second order by first-order vector metric\\nperturbations, dubbing these induced tensor modes $\\\\textit{vector-induced\\ngravitational waves}$ (VIGWs). Notably, considering an inflation-inspired\\npower-law type magnetic field power spectrum of the form $P_B(k)\\\\propto\\nk^{n_\\\\mathrm{B}}$ (where $n_{\\\\rm B}$ is the magnetic spectral index), we show\\nthat the VIGW signal is enhanced for stiff post-inflationary EoS, with the\\nmaximum enhancement happening for $w=1$. We explicitly demonstrate this\\ncontribution is dominant over the first-order magnetically-sourced GWs. The\\nVIGW spectrum exhibits a maximum at around the scale crossing the cosmological\\nhorizon at the end of reheating, $k_\\\\mathrm{reh}$, with its present day peak\\namplitude scaling as $\\\\Omega_{\\\\rm GW}(k_{\\\\rm reh},\\\\eta_0)\\\\propto \\\\Delta N_{\\\\rm\\nreh}\\\\times(H_{\\\\rm inf}/M_{\\\\rm Pl})^{8}$, where $H_{\\\\rm inf}$ is the Hubble\\nparameter at the end of inflation and $\\\\Delta N_{\\\\rm reh}$ the duration of the\\npost-inflationary era in $e$-folds. For $w=1$ (kination) and $n_{\\\\rm B}>-3/2$,\\none further obtains a nearly $n_{\\\\rm B}$-independent frequency scaling of the\\nGW spectrum of the form $\\\\Omega_{\\\\rm GW}(f,\\\\eta_0)\\\\propto \\\\left(\\\\frac{f}{f_{\\\\rm\\nreh}}\\\\right)^{-2.8}$ for $f>f_\\\\mathrm{reh}\\\\equiv k_\\\\mathrm{reh}/(2\\\\pi)$.\\nFinally, we need to highlight that the VIGW signal can be well within the\\ndetection bands of several next-generation interferometric GW missions at small\\nscales. Indicatively, for $H_{\\\\rm inf} \\\\sim O(10^{7})\\\\:\\\\mathrm{GeV}$ and\\n$O(10^{14})\\\\:\\\\mathrm{GeV}$, and $\\\\Delta N_{\\\\rm reh} \\\\sim 15$ and $10$, the VIGW\\nsignal is found to be detectable by LISA and ET respectively.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:59:05Z\"}"}
