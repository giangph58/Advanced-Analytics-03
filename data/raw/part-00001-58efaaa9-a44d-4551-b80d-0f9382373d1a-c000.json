Previous studies have shown that this exponent is a smooth\\nfunction of eigenenergy in the same phase, thus its non-smoothness can serve as\\nstrong evidence to determine the phase transition from the extended phase to\\nthe localized phase. However, logically, there is no fundamental reason that\\nprohibits this Lyapunov exponent from being non-smooth in the localized phase.\\nIn this work, we show that if the localization centers are inhomogeneous in the\\nwhole chain and if the system possesses (at least) two different localization\\nmodes, the Lyapunov exponent can become non-smooth in the localized phase at\\nthe boundaries between the different localization modes. We demonstrate these\\nresults using several slowly varying models and show that the singularities of\\ndensity of states are essential to these non-smoothness, according to the\\nThouless formula. These results can be generalized to higher-dimensional\\nmodels, suggesting the possible delicate structures in the localized phase,\\nwhich can revise our understanding of localization hence greatly advance our\\ncomprehension of Anderson localization.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T11:44:44Z\"}"}
