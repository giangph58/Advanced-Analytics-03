{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06955v1\", \"title\": \"Parametric Reachable Sets Via Controlled Dynamical Embeddings\", \"summary\": \"In this work, we propose a new framework for reachable set computation\\nthrough continuous evolution of a set of parameters and offsets which define a\\nparametope, through the intersection of constraints. This results in a\\ndynamical approach towards nonlinear reachability analysis: a single trajectory\\nof an embedding system provides a parametope reachable set for the original\\nsystem, and uncertainties are accounted for through continuous parameter\\nevolution. This is dual to most existing computational strategies, which define\\nsets through some combination of generator vectors, and usually discretize the\\nsystem dynamics. We show how, under some regularity assumptions of the dynamics\\nand the set considered, any desired parameter evolution can be accommodated as\\nlong as the offset dynamics are set accordingly, providing a virtual \\\"control\\ninput\\\" for reachable set computation. In a special case of the theory, we\\ndemonstrate how closing the loop for the parameter dynamics using the adjoint\\nof the linearization results in a desirable first-order cancellation of the\\noriginal system dynamics. Using interval arithmetic in JAX, we demonstrate the\\nefficiency and utility of reachable parametope computation through two\\nnumerical examples.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T15:02:46Z\"}"}
