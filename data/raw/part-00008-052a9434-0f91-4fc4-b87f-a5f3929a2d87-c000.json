By applying the use of fine-tuned large language models, this study\\naims to investigate which motifs exactly that the texts in this corpus have in\\ncommon, and in which ways they differ from each other. The results show that\\nwhile some motifs persist throughout the corpus, others fluctuate in frequency,\\nindicating certain trends or external influences. Conclusively, the method\\nproves to adequately extract literary motifs according to a set definition,\\nproviding data for both quantitative and qualitative analyses.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T15:39:06Z\"}"}
