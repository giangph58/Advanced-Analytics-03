{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12158v1\", \"title\": \"What is a monoid?\", \"summary\": \"In many situations one encounters a notion that resembles that of a monoid.\\nIt consists of a carrier and two operations that resemble a unit and a\\nmultiplication, subject to three equations that resemble associativity and left\\nand right unital laws. The question then arises whether this notion in fact\\nthat of a monoid in a suitable sense. Category theorists have answered this\\nquestion by providing a notion of monoid in a monoidal category, or more\\ngenerally in a multicategory. While this encompasses many examples, it is\\nunsuitable in other cases, such as the notion of relative monad, and the\\nmodelling of call-by-push-value sequencing. In each of these examples, the\\nleftmost and/or the rightmost factor of a multiplication or associativity law\\nseems to be distinguished. To include such examples, we generalize the\\nmulticategorical framework in two stages. Firstly, we move to the framework of\\na left-skew multicategory (due to Bourke and Lack), which generalizes both\\nmulticategory and left-skew monoidal category. The notion of monoid in this\\nframework encompasses examples where only the leftmost factor is distinguished,\\nsuch as the notion of relative monad. Secondly, we consider monoids in the\\nnovel framework of a bi-skew multicategory. This encompasses examples where\\nboth the leftmost and the rightmost factor are distinguished, such as the\\nnotion of a category on a span, and the modelling of call-by-push-value\\nsequencing. In the bi-skew framework (which is the most general), we give a\\ncoherence result saying that a monoid corresponds to an unbiased monoid, i.e. a\\nmap from the unit bi-skew multicategory.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CT\", \"categories\": \"math.CT,cs.PL,F.3.2\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T15:04:48Z\"}"}
