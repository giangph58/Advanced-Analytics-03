We utilize VR controllers and eye-tracking\\nhardware to facilitate rapid ground truth generation and proofreading for deep\\nlearning-based cell tracking models. Life scientists reconstruct the\\ndevelopmental history of organisms on the cellular level by analyzing 3D\\ntime-lapse microscopy images acquired at high spatio-temporal resolution. The\\nreconstruction of such cell lineage trees traditionally involves tracking\\nindividual cells through all recorded time points, manually annotating their\\npositions, and then linking them over time to create complete trajectories.\\nDeep learning-based algorithms accelerate this process, yet depend heavily on\\nmanually-annotated high-quality ground truth data and curation. Visual\\nrepresentation of the image data in this process still relies primarily on 2D\\nrenderings, which greatly limits spatial understanding and navigation. In this\\nwork, we bridge the gap between deep learning-based cell tracking software and\\n3D/VR visualization to create a human-in-the-loop cell tracking system. We lift\\nthe incremental annotation, training and proofreading loop of the deep learning\\nmodel into the 3rd dimension and apply natural user interfaces like hand\\ngestures and eye tracking to accelerate the cell tracking workflow for life\\nscientists.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T11:27:01Z\"}"}
