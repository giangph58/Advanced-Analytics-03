{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20036v1\", \"title\": \"exoALMA. VI. Rotating under Pressure: Rotation curves, azimuthal\\n  velocity substructures, and pressure variations\", \"summary\": \"The bulk motion of the gas in protoplanetary disks around newborn stars is\\nnearly Keplerian. By leveraging the high angular and spectral resolution of\\nALMA, we can detect small-scale velocity perturbations in molecular line\\nobservations caused by local gas pressure variations in the disk, possibly\\ninduced by embedded protoplanets. This paper presents the azimuthally averaged\\nrotational velocity and its deviations from Keplerian rotation\\n($\\\\delta\\\\upsilon_{\\\\phi}$) for the exoALMA sample, as measured in the $^{12}$CO\\nand $^{13}$CO emission lines. The rotation signatures show evidence for\\nvertically stratified disks, in which $^{13}$CO rotates faster than $^{12}$CO\\ndue to a distinct thermal gas pressure gradient at their emitting heights. We\\nfind $\\\\delta\\\\upsilon_{\\\\phi}$-substructures in the sample on both small\\n($\\\\sim$10 au) and large ($\\\\sim$100 au) radial scales, reaching deviations up to\\n15% from background Keplerian velocity in the most extreme cases. More than 75%\\nof the rings and 80% of the gaps in the dust continuum emission resolved in\\n$\\\\delta\\\\upsilon_{\\\\phi}$ are co-located with gas pressure maxima and minima,\\nrespectively. Additionally, gas pressure substructures are observed far beyond\\nthe dust continuum emission. For the first time, we determined the gas pressure\\nderivative at the midplane from observations and found it to align well with\\nthe dust substructures within the given uncertainties. Based on our findings,\\nwe conclude that gas pressure variations are likely the dominant mechanism for\\nring and gap formation in the dust continuum.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:57:27Z\"}"}
