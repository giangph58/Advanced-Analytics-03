The\\nconsidered model is the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model on the square\\nlattice. Here $J_1 < 0$ and $J_2 > 0$ are the nearest and next-to-nearest\\nneighboring couplings, respectively. We train the CNN using the configurations\\nof $g \\\\stackrel{\\\\text{def}}{=} J_2/|J_1| = 0.7$ and employ the resulting CNN to\\nstudy the phase transition of $g = 0.8$. We find that this transfer learning is\\nsuccessful. In particular, only configurations of two temperatures, one is\\nbelow and one is above the critical temperature $T_c$ of $g=0.7$, are needed to\\nreach accurately determination of the $T_c$ of $g=0.8$. However, it may be\\nsubtle to use this strategy for the training. Specifically, for the considered\\nmodel, due to the inefficiency of the single spin flip algorithm used in\\nsampling the configurations at the low-temperature region, the two temperatures\\nassociated with the training set should not be too far away from the $T_c$ of\\n$g=0.7$, otherwise, the performance of the obtained CNN is not of high quality,\\nhence cannot determine the $T_c$ of $g=0.8$ accurately. For the considered\\nmodel, we also uncover the condition for training a successful CNN when only\\nconfigurations of two temperatures are considered as the training set.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-lat\", \"categories\": \"hep-lat,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T13:38:10Z\"}"}
