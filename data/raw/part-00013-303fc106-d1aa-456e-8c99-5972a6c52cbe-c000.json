{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10048v1\", \"title\": \"Multi-Object Grounding via Hierarchical Contrastive Siamese Transformers\", \"summary\": \"Multi-object grounding in 3D scenes involves localizing multiple objects\\nbased on natural language input. While previous work has primarily focused on\\nsingle-object grounding, real-world scenarios often demand the localization of\\nseveral objects. To tackle this challenge, we propose Hierarchical Contrastive\\nSiamese Transformers (H-COST), which employs a Hierarchical Processing strategy\\nto progressively refine object localization, enhancing the understanding of\\ncomplex language instructions. Additionally, we introduce a Contrastive Siamese\\nTransformer framework, where two networks with the identical structure are\\nused: one auxiliary network processes robust object relations from ground-truth\\nlabels to guide and enhance the second network, the reference network, which\\noperates on segmented point-cloud data. This contrastive mechanism strengthens\\nthe model' s semantic understanding and significantly enhances its ability to\\nprocess complex point-cloud data. Our approach outperforms previous\\nstate-of-the-art methods by 9.5% on challenging multi-object grounding\\nbenchmarks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:53:48Z\"}"}
