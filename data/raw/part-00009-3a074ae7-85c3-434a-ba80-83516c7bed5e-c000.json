{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04891v1\", \"title\": \"Leveraging Large Language Models for Cost-Effective, Multilingual\\n  Depression Detection and Severity Assessment\", \"summary\": \"Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder that is difficult to detect\\nearly due to subjective symptom assessments. Recent advancements in large\\nlanguage models have offered efficient and cost-effective approaches for this\\nobjective. In this study, we evaluated the performance of four LLMs in\\ndepression detection using clinical interview data. We selected the best\\nperforming model and further tested it in the severity evaluation scenario and\\nknowledge enhanced scenario. The robustness was evaluated in complex diagnostic\\nscenarios using a dataset comprising 51074 statements from six different mental\\ndisorders. We found that DeepSeek V3 is the most reliable and cost-effective\\nmodel for depression detection, performing well in both zero-shot and few-shot\\nscenarios, with zero-shot being the most efficient choice. The evaluation of\\nseverity showed low agreement with the human evaluator, particularly for mild\\ndepression. The model maintains stably high AUCs for detecting depression in\\ncomplex diagnostic scenarios. These findings highlight DeepSeek V3s strong\\npotential for text-based depression detection in real-world clinical\\napplications. However, they also underscore the need for further refinement in\\nseverity assessment and the mitigation of potential biases to enhance clinical\\nreliability.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T09:58:19Z\"}"}
