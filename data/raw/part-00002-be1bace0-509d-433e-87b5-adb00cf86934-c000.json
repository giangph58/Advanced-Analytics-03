It is known that, if $m$ has\\nsome low regularity, e.g., continuous or $W^{1/3,3}$, then $m$ is automatically\\nmore regular: locally Lipschitz outside a locally finite set. A long-standing\\nconjecture by Aviles and Giga, if true, would imply the same regularizing\\neffect under the Besov regularity assumption $m\\\\in B^{1/3}_{p,\\\\infty}$ for\\n$p>3$. In this note we establish that regularizing effect in the borderline\\ncase $p=6$, above which the Besov regularity assumption implies continuity. If\\nthe domain is a disk and $m$ satisfies tangent boundary conditions, we also\\nprove this for $p$ slightly below $6$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T16:50:37Z\"}"}
