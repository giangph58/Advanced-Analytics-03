Upon thermal annealing of GO, the resulting reduced graphene oxide\\n(rGO) films exhibit spatially varying coverage, leading to three distinct GaN\\nnucleation outcomes: (i) ELOG-like nucleation on exposed substrate regions,\\n(ii) thru-hole epitaxy (THE)-like nucleation through appropriately thin areas,\\nand (iii) complete nucleation suppression on thickly stacked zones. On\\nspin-coated GO films without TBA, all three behaviors coexist, and undesired\\nELOG- and no-nucleation modes persist due to uneven coverage. Importantly,\\nthese issues cannot be resolved by simply adjusting GO flake concentration, as\\nconcentration tuning alone fails to eliminate the formation of locally bare and\\noverly thick regions. In contrast, the addition of TBA results in a more\\nuniform, moderately stacked rGO morphology that suppresses both ELOG- and\\nno-nucleation modes while expanding THE-like nucleation regions. This reshaped\\nnucleation landscape confines GaN growth to areas with engineered percolative\\ntransport. The approach offers a scalable, lithography-free route for\\ncontrolling GaN epitaxy using solution-processable 2D material masks.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:26:07Z\"}"}
