This approach successfully identifies the critical point\\nassociated with the topological phase transition and reveals a singular point\\nwhere the ground state exhibits uniform, nonzero entanglement between all\\nfermion pairs, corresponding to a fully connected network structure. We provide\\nan analytical explanation for this singular behavior and establish a connection\\nto the concept of ground state factorization observed in spin chains. Moreover,\\nwe analyze the open chain scenario and observe characteristic symmetry changes\\nin the ground state corresponding to Majorana zero modes. These results\\ndemonstrate the power of complex network analysis in revealing hidden features\\nin such systems.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T10:37:46Z\"}"}
