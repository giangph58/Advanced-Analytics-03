This paper\\npresents noise-adaptive folding, a technique that enhances zero-noise\\nextrapolation (ZNE) through the use of adaptive scaling factors based on\\ncircuit error measurements. Furthermore, we introduce two filtering methods:\\none relies on measuring error strength, while the other utilizes statistical\\nfiltering to improve the extrapolation process. Comparing our approach with\\nstandard ZNE reveals that adaptive scaling factors can be optimized using\\neither a noise model or direct error strength measurements from inverted\\ncircuits. The integration of adaptive scaling with filtering techniques leads\\nto notable improvements in expectation-value extrapolation over standard ZNE.\\nOur findings demonstrate that these adaptive methods effectively strengthen\\nerror mitigation against noise fluctuations, thereby enhancing the precision\\nand reliability of quantum computations.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:35:01Z\"}"}
