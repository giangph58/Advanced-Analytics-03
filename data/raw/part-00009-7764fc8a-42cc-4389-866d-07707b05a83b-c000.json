The general solution interpolates smoothly between Kerr and\\nstatic Topological Star geometries. We show that for specific choices of the\\nparameters and quantized values of the angular momentum the geometry terminates\\non a smooth five-dimensional cap, and it displays neither ergoregion nor closed\\ntimelike curves and a region of Gregory-Laflamme stability. We discuss the\\ndimensional reduction to four dimensions and the propagation of particles and\\nwaves showing that geodetic motion is integrable and the radial and angular\\npropagation of scalar perturbations can be separated and described in terms of\\ntwo ordinary differential equations of confluent Heun type.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T16:35:22Z\"}"}
