{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02294v1\", \"title\": \"Search for Fast Radio Bursts and radio pulsars from pulsing\\n  Ultraluminous X-ray Sources\", \"summary\": \"We conducted targeted fast radio burst (FRB) and pulsar searches on eight\\npulsing ultraluminous X-ray sources (PULXs) using the Five-hundred-meter\\nAperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST) and the Parkes 64-meter Radio\\nTelescope (Murriyang) to investigate whether PULXs could be progenitors of\\nFRBs. FAST carried out 12 observations of four PULXs, totaling 8 hours, while\\nParkes conducted 12 observations of the remaining four PULXs, totaling 11\\nhours. No significant signals were detected through single-pulse and periodic\\nsearches, covering a dispersion measure (DM) range of 0-5000 pc cm$^{-3}$,\\nplacing stringent upper limits on the radio flux density from these sources.\\nThe results imply that accretion processes and dense stellar winds in PULXs\\nlikely suppress or attenuate potential coherent emission in radio band.\\nAdditionally, the beaming factor and luminosity of FRBs associated with PULXs,\\nas well as the highly relativistic and magnetized nature of their outflows, may\\nlimit detectability. Non-detection yielded from the observations covering the\\nfull orbital phases of PULXs can also constrain the theoretical models that\\nlink FRB emission to highly magnetized neutron stars in binary systems.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T05:49:34Z\"}"}
