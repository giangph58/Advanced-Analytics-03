Conventional approaches that rely on\\nrelatively large covariance parameters tend to produce blurred representations,\\nwhile directly reducing covariance sizes leads to sparsity. In this work, we\\nintroduce Micro-splatting (Maximizing Isotropic Constraints for Refined\\nOptimization in 3D Gaussian Splatting), a novel framework designed to overcome\\nthese limitations. Our approach leverages a covariance regularization term to\\npenalize excessively large Gaussians to ensure each splat remains compact and\\nisotropic. This work implements an adaptive densification strategy that\\ndynamically refines regions with high image gradients by lowering the splitting\\nthreshold, followed by loss function enhancement. This strategy results in a\\ndenser and more detailed gaussian means where needed, without sacrificing\\nrendering efficiency. Quantitative evaluations using metrics such as L1, L2,\\nPSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, alongside qualitative comparisons demonstrate that our\\nmethod significantly enhances fine-details in 3D reconstructions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GR\", \"categories\": \"cs.GR,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T07:15:58Z\"}"}
