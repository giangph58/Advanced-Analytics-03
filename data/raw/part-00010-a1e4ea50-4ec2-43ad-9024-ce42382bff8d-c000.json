However, effectively leveraging this\\nability for example-based arbitrary style transfer, where an input text is\\nrewritten to match the style of a given exemplar, remains an open challenge. A\\nkey question is how to describe the style of the exemplar to guide LLMs toward\\nhigh-quality rewrites. In this work, we propose a prompting method based on\\nregister analysis to guide LLMs to perform this task. Empirical evaluations\\nacross multiple style transfer tasks show that our prompting approach enhances\\nstyle transfer strength while preserving meaning more effectively than existing\\nprompting strategies.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T17:39:02Z\"}"}
