{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03185v1\", \"title\": \"Behavioral Sensing and Intervention Paradigm: A Review of Closed-Loop\\n  Approaches for Ingestion Health\", \"summary\": \"Ingestive behavior plays a critical role in health, yet many existing\\ninterventions remain limited to static guidance or manual self-tracking. With\\nthe increasing integration of sensors and perceptual computing, recent systems\\nhave begun to support closed-loop interventions that dynamically sense user\\nbehavior and provide feedback during or around ingestion episodes. In this\\nsurvey, we review 136 studies that leverage sensor-enabled or\\ninteraction-mediated approaches to influence eating behavior. We propose a\\nbehavioral closed-loop paradigm comprising three core components: target\\nbehaviors, sensing modalities, and feedback strategies. A taxonomy of sensing\\nand intervention modalities is presented, organized along human- and\\nenvironment-based dimensions. Our analysis also examines evaluation methods and\\ndesign trends across different modality-behavior pairings. This review reveals\\nprevailing patterns and critical gaps, offering design insights for future\\nadaptive and context-aware ingestion health interventions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T05:06:44Z\"}"}
