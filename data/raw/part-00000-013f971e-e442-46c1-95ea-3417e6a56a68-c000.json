The analysis includes comparisons with several\\ncode lengths $N$ and various number of decoding attempts $T_{max}$. For\\n$N=1024$ and the coding rate $R=\\\\frac{1}{2}$, the DSCFP and the SCP algorithms\\nwith $T_{max}=17$ are bested by approximately $0.1$\\\\,dB at block error rate\\n(BLER) of $0.001$. At $\\\\text{BLER}=10^{-6}$ and for $T_{max}=64$, the gain is\\nof $0.375$ dB and $>0.5$ dB with respect to DSCF and SCP, respectively. At high\\nsignal-to-noise ratio, the average computational complexity of the proposed\\nalgorithms is virtually equivalent to that of SC.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T14:08:25Z\"}"}
