The model is based on a kinetic equation that is valid provided\\nthat the extrusion rate is high enough and the resulting loop ensemble is\\nsufficiently sparse. Within the one-loop approximation of diagrammatic\\ncalculations, a semi-analytical method for determining the mean square physical\\ndistance between a pair of chain beads as a function of the contour distance\\nbetween them is developed. The model is based on a kinetic equation that is\\nvalid provided that the extrusion rate is high enough and the resulting loop\\nensemble is sufficiently sparse. Within the framework of the one-loop\\napproximation of diagrammatic calculations, a semi-analytical method for\\ndetermining the mean square of the physical distance between a pair of chain\\nsections as a function of the contour distance between them is developed. The\\nmean square of the physical distance and its logarithmic derivative as\\nfunctions of the contour separation are plotted for different values of the\\nequilibrium degree. The results are compared with the case of frozen disorder\\nof sparse loops.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T09:51:05Z\"}"}
