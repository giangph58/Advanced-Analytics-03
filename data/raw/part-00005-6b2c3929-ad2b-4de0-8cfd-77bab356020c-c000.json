{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03611v1\", \"title\": \"Learning Unknown Spoof Prompts for Generalized Face Anti-Spoofing Using\\n  Only Real Face Images\", \"summary\": \"Face anti-spoofing is a critical technology for ensuring the security of face\\nrecognition systems. However, its ability to generalize across diverse\\nscenarios remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we attribute the\\nlimited generalization ability to two key factors: covariate shift, which\\narises from external data collection variations, and semantic shift, which\\nresults from substantial differences in emerging attack types. To address both\\nchallenges, we propose a novel approach for learning unknown spoof prompts,\\nrelying solely on real face images from a single source domain. Our method\\ngenerates textual prompts for real faces and potential unknown spoof attacks by\\nleveraging the general knowledge embedded in vision-language models, thereby\\nenhancing the model's ability to generalize to unseen target domains.\\nSpecifically, we introduce a diverse spoof prompt optimization framework to\\nlearn effective prompts. This framework constrains unknown spoof prompts within\\na relaxed prior knowledge space while maximizing their distance from real face\\nimages. Moreover, it enforces semantic independence among different spoof\\nprompts to capture a broad range of spoof patterns. Experimental results on\\nnine datasets demonstrate that the learned prompts effectively transfer the\\nknowledge of vision-language models, enabling state-of-the-art generalization\\nability against diverse unknown attack types across unseen target domains\\nwithout using any spoof face images.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:09:37Z\"}"}
