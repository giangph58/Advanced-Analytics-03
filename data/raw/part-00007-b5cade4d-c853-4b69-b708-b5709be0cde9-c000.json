{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05082v1\", \"title\": \"ItDPDM: Information-Theoretic Discrete Poisson Diffusion Model\", \"summary\": \"Existing methods for generative modeling of discrete data, such as symbolic\\nmusic tokens, face two primary challenges: (1) they either embed discrete\\ninputs into continuous state-spaces or (2) rely on variational losses that only\\napproximate the true negative log-likelihood. Previous efforts have\\nindividually targeted these limitations. While information-theoretic Gaussian\\ndiffusion models alleviate the suboptimality of variational losses, they still\\nperform modeling in continuous domains. In this work, we introduce the\\nInformation-Theoretic Discrete Poisson Diffusion Model (ItDPDM), which\\nsimultaneously addresses both limitations by directly operating in a discrete\\nstate-space via a Poisson diffusion process inspired by photon arrival\\nprocesses in camera sensors. We introduce a novel Poisson Reconstruction Loss\\n(PRL) and derive an exact relationship between PRL and the true negative\\nlog-likelihood, thereby eliminating the need for approximate evidence lower\\nbounds. Experiments conducted on the Lakh MIDI symbolic music dataset and the\\nCIFAR-10 image benchmark demonstrate that ItDPDM delivers significant\\nimprovements, reducing test NLL by up to 80% compared to prior baselines, while\\nalso achieving faster convergence.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.IT,math.IT,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T09:29:05Z\"}"}
