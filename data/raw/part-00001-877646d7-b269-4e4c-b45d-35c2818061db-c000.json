{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12976v1\", \"title\": \"Sparks of Science: Hypothesis Generation Using Structured Paper Data\", \"summary\": \"Generating novel and creative scientific hypotheses is a cornerstone in\\nachieving Artificial General Intelligence. Large language and reasoning models\\nhave the potential to aid in the systematic creation, selection, and validation\\nof scientifically informed hypotheses. However, current foundation models often\\nstruggle to produce scientific ideas that are both novel and feasible. One\\nreason is the lack of a dedicated dataset that frames Scientific Hypothesis\\nGeneration (SHG) as a Natural Language Generation (NLG) task. In this paper, we\\nintroduce HypoGen, the first dataset of approximately 5500 structured\\nproblem-hypothesis pairs extracted from top-tier computer science conferences\\nstructured with a Bit-Flip-Spark schema, where the Bit is the conventional\\nassumption, the Spark is the key insight or conceptual leap, and the Flip is\\nthe resulting counterproposal. HypoGen uniquely integrates an explicit\\nChain-of-Reasoning component that reflects the intellectual process from Bit to\\nFlip. We demonstrate that framing hypothesis generation as conditional language\\nmodelling, with the model fine-tuned on Bit-Flip-Spark and the\\nChain-of-Reasoning (and where, at inference, we only provide the Bit), leads to\\nimprovements in the overall quality of the hypotheses. Our evaluation employs\\nautomated metrics and LLM judge rankings for overall quality assessment. We\\nshow that by fine-tuning on our HypoGen dataset we improve the novelty,\\nfeasibility, and overall quality of the generated hypotheses. The HypoGen\\ndataset is publicly available at\\nhuggingface.co/datasets/UniverseTBD/hypogen-dr1.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T14:29:18Z\"}"}
