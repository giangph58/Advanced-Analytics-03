{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24180v1\", \"title\": \"Navi-plus: Managing Ambiguous GUI Navigation Tasks with Follow-up\", \"summary\": \"Graphical user interfaces (GUI) automation agents are emerging as powerful\\ntools, enabling humans to accomplish increasingly complex tasks on smart\\ndevices. However, users often inadvertently omit key information when conveying\\ntasks, which hinders agent performance in the current agent paradigm that does\\nnot support immediate user intervention. To address this issue, we introduce a\\n$\\\\textbf{Self-Correction GUI Navigation}$ task that incorporates interactive\\ninformation completion capabilities within GUI agents. We developed the\\n$\\\\textbf{Navi-plus}$ dataset with GUI follow-up question-answer pairs,\\nalongside a $\\\\textbf{Dual-Stream Trajectory Evaluation}$ method to benchmark\\nthis new capability. Our results show that agents equipped with the ability to\\nask GUI follow-up questions can fully recover their performance when faced with\\nambiguous user tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:56:24Z\"}"}
