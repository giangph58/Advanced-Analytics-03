{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21262v1\", \"title\": \"Thermally Induced Refractive Index Trimming of Visible-Light Silicon\\n  Nitride Waveguides Using Suspended Heaters\", \"summary\": \"We demonstrate refractive index trimming of visible-light silicon nitride\\n(SiN) waveguides using suspended heater structures. The thermal isolation of\\nthe suspended heaters enabled a semi-uniform temperature distribution with\\nestimated temperatures of $\\\\sim$350{\\\\deg}C in the waveguides without reaching\\npotentially damaging temperatures in the titanium nitride resistive heaters.\\nThe thermal isolation also enabled trimming temperatures to be reached with a\\nmoderate power dissipation of 30 to 40 mW. At a wavelength of 561 nm, modal\\neffective index changes up to $-8.3 \\\\times 10^{-3}$ were observed following\\nthermal trimming, and the index changes were stable over an observation period\\nof 97 days. The devices were fabricated as part of our visible-light integrated\\nphotonics platform on 200-mm diameter silicon wafers. The suspended heaters\\nalso functioned as efficient thermo-optic phase shifters with power dissipation\\nfor a $\\\\pi$ phase shift of about $1.2-1.8$ mW. The trimming method was applied\\nto set the bias points of thermo-optic Mach-Zehnder interferometer switches to\\nreduce the bias power of five devices from $0.29-2.32$ mW to $0.1-0.16$ mW.\\nThermal trimming at a wavelength of 445 nm was also demonstrated. Through\\nmaterial analysis before and after thermal treatment, we hypothesize that index\\ntrimming of the silica (SiO$_2$) waveguide cladding may be a potential\\nunderlying mechanism. Additionally, via extrapolations of the measured trimming\\ndata, we estimate the thermal aging behavior of the SiN waveguides in the\\nsuspended heaters at lower (125 - 250{\\\\deg}C) operating temperatures.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T02:40:15Z\"}"}
