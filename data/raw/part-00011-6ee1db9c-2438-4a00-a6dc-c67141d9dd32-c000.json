When filled with magnetic particles, their\\neffective mechanical response can be modified by an external magnetic field. In\\nthe present study, we propose an effective theory of fibre-reinforced\\ncomposite, based on a neo-Hookean elastic response and a linear magnetic law in\\neach phase. The theory is shown suitable to describe the motion of composite\\ncylinders. Furthermore, it is found appropriate for the modelling of\\nfibre-reinforced composites subjected to a permanent magnetic field aligned\\nwith the fibres. To reach this result, we use the incremental theory ('small on\\nlarge'), in combination with homogenisation theory and the Bloch-Floquet\\nmethod. This way, we show that wave directivity is sensitive to the application\\nof a permanent magnetic field, whereas the frequency range in which wave\\npropagation is forbidden is not modified by such a load (the band gaps are\\ninvariant). In passing, we describe a method to deduce the total stress in the\\nmaterial based on the measurement of two wave speeds. Furthermore, we propose\\nan effective energy function for the description of nonlinear composites made\\nof Yeoh-type generalised neo-Hookean fibres within a neo-Hookean matrix.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T15:26:24Z\"}"}
