Special emphasis is placed on high-multiplicity fluctuations in jets.\\nSelecting events with hadronic multiplicity exceeding the average value by a\\nfactor of 3 or more in various processes has been a source of conundrums for\\nmany years. We discuss two recent high-multiplicity puzzles and attempt to\\nreveal their common origin.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T16:54:46Z\"}"}
