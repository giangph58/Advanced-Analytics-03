Traditional models, which focus on acoustic and\\nmagnetohydrodynamic waves and micro/nano-flares, fall short of explaining the\\nextreme heating of the solar corona and the origins of the supersonic solar\\nwind. In this study, we provide compelling observational evidence from Wind\\nspacecraft data supporting the Raghav effect, a mechanism where interactions\\nbetween the magnetic moments of charged particles and dynamic magnetic fields\\nresult in abrupt kinetic energy changes. Our analysis demonstrates that the\\nobserved proton plasma heating is consistent with theoretical predictions,\\nestablishing the Raghav effect as a universal mechanism for particle\\nenergization. This discovery offers a unified framework for understanding\\nenergy dynamics across a wide range of astrophysical magnetised plasma\\nenvironments.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.HE,physics.plasm-ph,physics.space-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T12:05:54Z\"}"}
