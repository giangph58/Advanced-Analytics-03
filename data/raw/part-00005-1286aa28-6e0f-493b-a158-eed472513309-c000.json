{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20390v1\", \"title\": \"Manifold Clustering with Schatten p-norm Maximization\", \"summary\": \"Manifold clustering, with its exceptional ability to capture complex data\\nstructures, holds a pivotal position in cluster analysis. However, existing\\nmethods often focus only on finding the optimal combination between K-means and\\nmanifold learning, and overlooking the consistency between the data structure\\nand labels. To address this issue, we deeply explore the relationship between\\nK-means and manifold learning, and on this basis, fuse them to develop a new\\nclustering framework. Specifically, the algorithm uses labels to guide the\\nmanifold structure and perform clustering on it, which ensures the consistency\\nbetween the data structure and labels. Furthermore, in order to naturally\\nmaintain the class balance in the clustering process, we maximize the Schatten\\np-norm of labels, and provide a theoretical proof to support this.\\nAdditionally, our clustering framework is designed to be flexible and\\ncompatible with many types of distance functions, which facilitates efficient\\nprocessing of nonlinear separable data. The experimental results of several\\ndatabases confirm the superiority of our proposed model.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T03:23:06Z\"}"}
