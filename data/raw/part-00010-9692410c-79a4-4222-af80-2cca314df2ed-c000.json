We study the evolution of black hole magnetospheres by\\nmeans of axisymmetric general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We\\nshow that all simulated initial magnetic field geometries of varying complexity\\nultimately evolve into a split monopole magnetosphere. The magnetospheric\\nevolution consists of two phases. In the first phase, the magnetosphere evolves\\ntoward pressure equilibrium accompanied by a large magnetic flux decrease on\\nthe event horizon on a fast Alfv\\\\'enic timescale of $\\\\sim 60$ light-crossing\\ntimes of the gravitational radius. The second phase proceeds in a pressure\\nbalance in which the magnetic flux decays and current sheets shift in polar\\nangle over the event horizon on slower resistive timescales. We present an\\nanalytic model for the second phase. Furthermore, we show that in a split\\nmonopole magnetosphere the magnetic flux on the event horizon decays\\nexponentially with a timescale that depends on the black hole spin, where\\nhigher spin results in slower decay. Our results can have an implications for\\nthe timescales of reconnection-powered flares and for multimessenger\\ncounterparts to gravitational wave events.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:12:31Z\"}"}
