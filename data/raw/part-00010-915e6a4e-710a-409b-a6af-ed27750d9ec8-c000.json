Recent progress in generative AI, such as image\\ngeneration, provides a disruptive technological solution to supporting human\\ncreativity further and helping humans generate solutions faster. While AI image\\ngenerators can help to rapidly visualize ideas based on user prompts, the use\\nof such AI systems has also been critiqued due to their considerable energy\\nusage. In this paper, we report on a user study (N = 24) to understand whether\\nenergy consumption can be reduced without impeding on the tool's perceived\\ncreativity support. Our results highlight that, for example, a main effect of\\n(image generation) condition on energy consumption, and index of creativity\\nsupport per prompt but not per task, which seem mainly attributed to image\\nquantity per prompt. We provide details of our analysis on the relation between\\nenergy usage, creativity support, and prompting behavior, including attitudes\\ntowards designing with AI and its environmental impact.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:55:14Z\"}"}
