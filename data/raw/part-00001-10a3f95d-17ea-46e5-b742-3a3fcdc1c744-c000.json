This approach entails mid-circuit measurements and\\nresets to simulate the addition or removal of fermions from the system and\\nprovides a way to apply non-reversible operations to a quantum computer. Using\\nthis method, we simulate the dynamics of an open electronic system consisting\\nof a fermionic chain positioned between two conductive leads on the\\n$ibm\\\\_torino$ quantum computer.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T15:57:02Z\"}"}
