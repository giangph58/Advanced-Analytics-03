Many applications, including\\ninverse scattering, optimal design, and uncertainty quantification, are based\\non shape derivatives. However, computing high order shape derivatives is\\nchallenging due to the complexity of shape calculus. This work introduces a\\ncomprehensive method for computing shape Taylor expansions in two dimensions\\nusing recurrence formulas. The approach is developed under sound-soft,\\nsound-hard, impedance, and transmission boundary conditions. Additionally, we\\napply the shape Taylor expansion to uncertainty quantification in wave\\nscattering, enabling high order moment estimation for the scattered field under\\nrandom boundary perturbations. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate\\nthe effectiveness of the shape Taylor expansion in achieving high order\\napproximations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T06:42:21Z\"}"}
