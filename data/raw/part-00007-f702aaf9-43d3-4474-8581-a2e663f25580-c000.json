In this study, we explore the\\ngrowth of vanadium dioxide films on standard wet-oxidized silicon wafers using\\ntwo established deposition techniques with pulsed laser deposition and atomic\\nlayer deposition. Thin films, ranging in thickness from 200 to 10 nano meters,\\nwere systematically characterized through structural and electrical analyses to\\noptimize key growth parameters. Temperature and pressure were identified as the\\nprimary factors affecting film quality, and the optimal growth conditions\\nacross the entire thickness range are discussed in detail. We demonstrate that\\nboth pulsed laser deposition and atomic layer deposition methods can\\nsuccessfully produce ultra-thin vanadium dioxide layers down to 8 nano meters\\nwith functional properties suitable for practical applications. This work\\nunderscores the potential of vanadium dioxide for fully industry compatible\\nphase-change switching devices and provides valuable insights into optimizing\\ngrowth processes for poly-crystalline films.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:59:24Z\"}"}
