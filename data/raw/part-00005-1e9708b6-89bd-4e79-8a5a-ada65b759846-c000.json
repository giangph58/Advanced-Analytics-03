This study\\nproposes a novel approach using a prefixed patch time series Transformer model\\nthat automates the solution of two-point boundary value problems from lunar\\nflyby to arbitrary terminal conditions. Using prefix tokens of terminal\\nconditions in our deep generative model enables solving boundary value problems\\nin three-body dynamics. The training dataset consists of trajectories obtained\\nthrough forward propagation rather than solving boundary value problems\\ndirectly. The model demonstrates potential practical utility for preliminary\\ntrajectory design in cislunar mission scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:22:03Z\"}"}
