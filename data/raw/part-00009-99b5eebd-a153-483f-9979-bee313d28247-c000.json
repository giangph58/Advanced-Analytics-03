Specifically, we show the\\nfollowing three results. Firstly, that there are constants $C>0$ and $c\\\\in\\n(0,1]$ such that, whenever $d/\\\\lambda\\\\ge C$, every $(n,d,\\\\lambda)$-graph\\ncontains a spanning subdivision of $K_t$ for all $2\\\\le t \\\\le\\n\\\\min\\\\{cd,c\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{n}{\\\\log n}}\\\\}$. Secondly, that there are constants $C>0$\\nand $c\\\\in (0,1]$ such that, whenever $d/\\\\lambda\\\\ge C\\\\log^3n$, every\\n$(n,d,\\\\lambda)$-graph contains a spanning nearly-balanced subdivision of $K_t$\\nfor all $2\\\\le t \\\\le \\\\min\\\\{cd,c\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{n}{\\\\log^3n}}\\\\}$. Finally, we show\\nthat for every $\\\\mu>0$, there are constants $c,\\\\varepsilon\\\\in (0,1]$ and\\n$n_0\\\\in \\\\mathbb N$ such that, whenever $n\\\\ge n_0$, every $n$-vertex graph with\\nminimum degree at least $\\\\mu n$ and no bipartite holes of size $\\\\varepsilon n$\\ncontains a spanning nearly-balanced subdivision of $K_t$ for all $2\\\\le t \\\\le\\nc\\\\sqrt{n}$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:46:24Z\"}"}
