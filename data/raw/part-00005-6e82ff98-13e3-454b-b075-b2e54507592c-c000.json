{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15869v1\", \"title\": \"An Extended Horizon Tactical Decision-Making for Automated Driving Based\\n  on Monte Carlo Tree Search\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces COR-MCTS (Conservation of Resources - Monte Carlo Tree\\nSearch), a novel tactical decision-making approach for automated driving\\nfocusing on maneuver planning over extended horizons. Traditional\\ndecision-making algorithms are often constrained by fixed planning horizons,\\ntypically up to 6 seconds for classical approaches and 3 seconds for\\nlearning-based methods limiting their adaptability in particular dynamic\\ndriving scenarios. However, planning must be done well in advance in\\nenvironments such as highways, roundabouts, and exits to ensure safe and\\nefficient maneuvers. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid method\\nintegrating Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with our prior utility-based\\nframework, COR-MP (Conservation of Resources Model for Maneuver Planning). This\\ncombination enables long-term, real-time decision-making, significantly\\nenhancing the ability to plan a sequence of maneuvers over extended horizons.\\nThrough simulations across diverse driving scenarios, we demonstrate that\\nCOR-MCTS effectively improves planning robustness and decision efficiency over\\nextended horizons.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T13:11:16Z\"}"}
