Recognizing the sparsity and complexity of 3D space, previous\\nvision-centric methods have employed implicit learning-based approaches to\\nmodel spatial and temporal information. However, these approaches struggle to\\ncapture local details and diminish the model's spatial discriminative ability.\\nTo address these challenges, we propose a novel explicit state-based modeling\\nmethod designed to leverage the occupied state to renovate the 3D features.\\nSpecifically, we propose a sparse occlusion-aware attention mechanism,\\nintegrated with a cascade refinement strategy, which accurately renovates 3D\\nfeatures with the guidance of occupied state information. Additionally, we\\nintroduce a novel method for modeling long-term dynamic interactions, which\\nreduces computational costs and preserves spatial information. Compared to the\\nprevious state-of-the-art methods, our efficient explicit renovation strategy\\nnot only delivers superior performance in terms of RayIoU and mAVE for\\noccupancy and scene flow prediction but also markedly reduces GPU memory usage\\nduring training, bringing it down to 8.7GB.
