We demonstrate that it is possible to\\nrelax certain smoothness requirements of the asymptotic transformations\\nconsidered previously, without violating asymptotic flatness. This leads to an\\nenhancement of the asymptotic symmetry group that includes logarithmic\\nsupertranslations at spatial infinity. Our results complement several recent\\nresults which confirm the existence of logarithmic supertranslations at spatial\\ninfinity in the Hamiltonian formalism.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:40:35Z\"}"}
