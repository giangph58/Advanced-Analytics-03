In such a model, two polariton states compete with\\nan overwhelming number of dark states, inhibiting polaritonic reactions\\nentropically. We analyze the higher excitation manifolds of the Tavis-Cummings\\nmodel along with a three-level system that resembles photochemical reactions.\\nWe demonstrate that allowing for more than a single excitation makes the\\nreaction of the involved polaritons entropically more favorable.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:13:07Z\"}"}
