{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03658v1\", \"title\": \"Ultrafast Non-Hermitian Skin Effect\", \"summary\": \"Topological phases of matter commonly feature protected states at their\\nboundaries. Transferring this protection to time-metamaterials is extremely\\nchallenging, as it requires the generation of an abrupt interface between two\\ntopologically distinct bulks. Here, we realize and measure an ultrafast\\ntopological non-Hermitian skin mode bound to an interface circulating within\\nthe cavity of a fast-gain semiconductor laser. The nonlinear stationary state\\ngenerated in such devices features a jump in the instantaneous frequency. We\\nshow that this discontinuity gives rise to a topological interface for the\\nfield fluctuations in the system. Using direct intensity sampling, we\\nexperimentally measure the skin modes and their positioning at the frequency\\njump of the stationary state. Analysis of these isolated modes reveals an\\nultrashort full-width at half-maximum of 583 $\\\\pm$ 16 fs. Furthermore, we show\\nthat we can tune the shape and relative timing shift of the skin modes via\\nexternal bias modulation. Finally, both numerical and experimental analysis of\\nthe noise in the system reveal that field fluctuations are funneled into the\\ntopological interface. Our findings reveal a new way to generate topologically\\nprotected states of light in time, which paves the way for novel time-varying\\nphysics as well as metrological applications.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T16:02:38Z\"}"}
