In this work, we address two distinct driving mechanisms in\\nelectric-field driven electron-spin resonance as implemented in scanning\\ntunneling spectroscopy. We study the origin of the driving field using a single\\norbital Anderson impurity, connected to polarized leads and biased by a voltage\\nmodulated on resonance with a spin transition. By mapping the quantum master\\nequation into a system of equations for the impurity spin, we identify two\\ndistinct driving mechanisms. Below the charging thresholds of the impurity,\\nelectron spin resonance is dominated by a magnetically exchange-driven\\nmechanism or field-like torque. Conversely, above the charging threshold\\nspin-transfer torque caused by the spin-polarized current through the impurity\\ndrives the spin transition. Only the first mechanism enables coherent quantum\\nspin control, while the second one leads to fast decoherence and spin\\naccumulation towards a non-equilibrium steady-state. The electron spin\\nresonance signals and spin dynamics vary significantly depending on which\\ndriving mechanism dominates, highlighting the potential for optimizing\\nquantum-coherent control in electrically driven quantum systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:10:22Z\"}"}
