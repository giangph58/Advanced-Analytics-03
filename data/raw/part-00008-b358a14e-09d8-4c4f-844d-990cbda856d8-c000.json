{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16031v1\", \"title\": \"VR-based Intervention for Perspective Change: A Case to Investigate\\n  Virtual Materiality\", \"summary\": \"This paper addresses the concept of materiality in virtual environments,\\nwhich we define as being composed of objects that can influence user experience\\nactively. Such virtual materiality is closely related to its physical\\ncounterpart, which is discussed in theoretical frameworks such as\\nsociomateriality and actor-network theory. They define phenomena in terms of\\nthe entanglement of human and non-human elements. We report on an early\\ninvestigation of virtual materiality within the context of reflection and\\nperspective change in nature-based virtual environments. We considered the case\\nof university students reflecting on the planning and management of their\\ntheses and major projects. Inspired by nature's known positive cognitive and\\naffective effects and repeated questioning processes, we established a virtual\\nreflection intervention to demonstrate the environmental mechanisms and\\nmaterial characteristics relevant to virtual materiality. Our work is a\\npreliminary step toward understanding virtual materiality and its implications\\nfor research and the design of virtual environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T16:53:21Z\"}"}
