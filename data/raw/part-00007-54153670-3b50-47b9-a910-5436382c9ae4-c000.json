{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20602v1\", \"title\": \"Purifying, Labeling, and Utilizing: A High-Quality Pipeline for Small\\n  Object Detection\", \"summary\": \"Small object detection is a broadly investigated research task and is\\ncommonly conceptualized as a \\\"pipeline-style\\\" engineering process. In the\\nupstream, images serve as raw materials for processing in the detection\\npipeline, where pre-trained models are employed to generate initial feature\\nmaps. In the midstream, an assigner selects training positive and negative\\nsamples. Subsequently, these samples and features are fed into the downstream\\nfor classification and regression. Previous small object detection methods\\noften focused on improving isolated stages of the pipeline, thereby neglecting\\nholistic optimization and consequently constraining overall performance gains.\\nTo address this issue, we have optimized three key aspects, namely Purifying,\\nLabeling, and Utilizing, in this pipeline, proposing a high-quality Small\\nobject detection framework termed PLUSNet. Specifically, PLUSNet comprises\\nthree sequential components: the Hierarchical Feature Purifier (HFP) for\\npurifying upstream features, the Multiple Criteria Label Assignment (MCLA) for\\nimproving the quality of midstream training samples, and the Frequency\\nDecoupled Head (FDHead) for more effectively exploiting information to\\naccomplish downstream tasks. The proposed PLUS modules are readily integrable\\ninto various object detectors, thus enhancing their detection capabilities in\\nmulti-scale scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed PLUSNet\\nconsistently achieves significant and consistent improvements across multiple\\ndatasets for small object detection.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T10:11:03Z\"}"}
