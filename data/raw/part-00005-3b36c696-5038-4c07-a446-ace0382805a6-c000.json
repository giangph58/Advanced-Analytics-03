In such systems, electron scattering processes vary drastically\\nand can be leveraged to guide heat across interfaces via radiative heat\\ntransport without engaging the lattice directly. We employ the formalism of\\nfluctuational electrodynamics to simulate the spectral radiative heat flux\\nacross the interface of a metal film and a non-metal substrate. We find that\\nthe radiative conductance can exceed 300 MW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ at an electron\\ntemperature of 5000 K for an emitting tungsten film on a hexagonal boron\\nnitride substrate, becoming comparable to its conductive counterpart. This\\nallows for a more holistic approach to the heat flow across interfaces,\\naccounting for electron-phonon non-equilibrium and ultrafast near-field\\nphonon-polariton coupling.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T04:36:29Z\"}"}
