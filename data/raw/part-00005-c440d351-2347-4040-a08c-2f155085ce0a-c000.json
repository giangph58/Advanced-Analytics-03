Specifically, in\\norder to effectively utilize Gauss-Jacobi quadrature to discretize Caputo\\nderivatives, we design the tensor neural network function multiplied by the\\nfunction $t^{\\\\mu}$ where the power $\\\\mu$ is selected according to the\\nparameters of the equations at hand. Finally, some numerical examples are\\nprovided to validate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed tensor neural\\nnetwork-based machine learning method.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T07:50:23Z\"}"}
