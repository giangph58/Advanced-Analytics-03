In thin films fabricated from these materials, the\\ncombination of disorder and the low effective dimensionality leads to increased\\norder parameter fluctuations and enhanced kinetic inductance values. Among the\\nchallenges of harnessing these compounds in coherent devices are their\\nproximity to the superconductor-insulator phase transition, the presence of\\nbroken Cooper pairs, and the two-level systems located in the disordered\\nstructure. In this work, we fabricate tungsten silicide wires from\\nquasi-two-dimensional films with one spatial dimension smaller than the\\nsuperconducting coherence length and embed them into microwave resonators and\\nfluxonium qubits, where the kinetic inductance provides the inductive part of\\nthe circuits. We study the dependence of loss on the frequency, disorder, and\\ngeometry of the device, and find that the loss increases with the level of\\ndisorder and is dominated by the localized quasiparticles trapped in the\\nspatial variations of the superconducting gap.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:56:04Z\"}"}
