By applying a\\ntime-space transformation, we show it is equivalent to stopping a Brownian\\nbridge pinned at a random endpoint with a time-dependent payoff. We prove that\\nthe optimal rule is the first entry into the stopping region, and establish\\nthat the value function is Lipschitz continuous on compacts via a coupling of\\nterminal pinning points across different initial conditions. A comparison\\ntheorems then order value functions according to likelihood-ratio ordering of\\nterminal densities, and when these densities have bounded support, we bound the\\noptimal boundary by that of a Gauss-Markov bridge. Although the stopping\\nboundary need not be the graph of a function in general, we provide sufficient\\nconditions under which this property holds, and identify strongly log-concave\\nterminal densities that guarantee this structure. Numerical experiments\\nillustrate representative boundary shapes.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:38:50Z\"}"}
