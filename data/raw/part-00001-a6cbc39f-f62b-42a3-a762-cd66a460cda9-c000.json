{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12757v1\", \"title\": \"MCP Guardian: A Security-First Layer for Safeguarding MCP-Based AI\\n  System\", \"summary\": \"As Agentic AI gain mainstream adoption, the industry invests heavily in model\\ncapabilities, achieving rapid leaps in reasoning and quality. However, these\\nsystems remain largely confined to data silos, and each new integration\\nrequires custom logic that is difficult to scale. The Model Context Protocol\\n(MCP) addresses this challenge by defining a universal, open standard for\\nsecurely connecting AI-based applications (MCP clients) to data sources (MCP\\nservers). However, the flexibility of the MCP introduces new risks, including\\nmalicious tool servers and compromised data integrity. We present MCP Guardian,\\na framework that strengthens MCP-based communication with authentication,\\nrate-limiting, logging, tracing, and Web Application Firewall (WAF) scanning.\\nThrough real-world scenarios and empirical testing, we demonstrate how MCP\\nGuardian effectively mitigates attacks and ensures robust oversight with\\nminimal overheads. Our approach fosters secure, scalable data access for AI\\nassistants, underscoring the importance of a defense-in-depth approach that\\nenables safer and more transparent innovation in AI-driven environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T08:49:10Z\"}"}
