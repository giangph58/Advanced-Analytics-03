However, many\\nexisting solutions remain overly complex, difficult to reimplement and\\nmaintain, and pose high barriers for users without substantial computational\\nexpertise. To address these challenges, we introduce PhenoAssistant: a\\npioneering AI-driven system that streamlines plant phenotyping via intuitive\\nnatural language interaction. PhenoAssistant leverages a large language model\\nto orchestrate a curated toolkit supporting tasks including automated phenotype\\nextraction, data visualisation and automated model training. We validate\\nPhenoAssistant through several representative case studies and a set of\\nevaluation tasks. By significantly lowering technical hurdles, PhenoAssistant\\nunderscores the promise of AI-driven methodologies to democratising AI adoption\\nin plant biology.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MA\", \"categories\": \"cs.MA,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:20:30Z\"}"}
