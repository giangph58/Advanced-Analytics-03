However, existing agent frameworks\\nstill face critical limitations in task planning and execution, restricting\\ntheir effectiveness and generalizability. Specifically, current planning\\nmethods often lack clear global goals, leading agents to get stuck in local\\nbranches, or produce non-executable plans. Meanwhile, existing execution\\nmechanisms struggle to balance complexity and stability, and their limited\\naction space restricts their ability to handle diverse real-world tasks. To\\naddress these limitations, we propose GoalAct, a novel agent framework that\\nintroduces a continuously updated global planning mechanism and integrates a\\nhierarchical execution strategy. GoalAct decomposes task execution into\\nhigh-level skills, including searching, coding, writing and more, thereby\\nreducing planning complexity while enhancing the agents' adaptability across\\ndiverse task scenarios. We evaluate GoalAct on LegalAgentBench, a benchmark\\nwith multiple types of legal tasks that require the use of multiple types of\\ntools. Experimental results demonstrate that GoalAct achieves state-of-the-art\\n(SOTA) performance, with an average improvement of 12.22% in success rate.\\nThese findings highlight GoalAct's potential to drive the development of more\\nadvanced intelligent agent systems, making them more effective across complex\\nreal-world applications.
