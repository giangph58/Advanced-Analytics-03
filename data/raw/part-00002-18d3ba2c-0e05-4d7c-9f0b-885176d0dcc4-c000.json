{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19914v1\", \"title\": \"Demographic Parity-aware Individualized Treatment Rules\", \"summary\": \"There has been growing interest in developing optimal individualized\\ntreatment rules (ITRs) in various fields, such as precision medicine, business\\ndecision-making, and social welfare distribution. The application of ITRs\\nwithin a societal context raises substantial concerns regarding potential\\ndiscrimination over sensitive attributes such as age, gender, or race. To\\naddress this concern directly, we introduce the concept of demographic parity\\nin ITRs. However, estimating an optimal ITR that satisfies the demographic\\nparity requires solving a non-convex constrained optimization problem. To\\novercome these computational challenges, we employ tailored fairness proxies\\ninspired by demographic parity and transform it into a convex quadratic\\nprogramming problem. Additionally, we establish the consistency of the proposed\\nestimator and the risk bound. The performance of the proposed method is\\ndemonstrated through extensive simulation studies and real data analysis.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:43:24Z\"}"}
