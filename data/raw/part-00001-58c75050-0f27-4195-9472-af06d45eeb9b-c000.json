In a previous study [Matsue, SIADS, 24(2025),\\n415-456], geometric criteria for characterizing blow-up solutions for\\nnonautonomous ODEs are provided by means of dynamics at infinity. The basic\\nidea towards the present aim is to correspond such criteria to leading-term\\nequations associated with blow-up ansatz characterizing multiple-order\\nasymptotic expansions, which originated from the corresponding study developed\\nin the framework of autonomous ODEs. Restricting our attention to constant\\ncoefficients of leading terms of blow-ups, results involving the simple\\ncriterion of blow-up characterizations in autonomous ODEs can be mimicked to\\nnonautonomous ODEs.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS,math.CA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T16:02:39Z\"}"}
