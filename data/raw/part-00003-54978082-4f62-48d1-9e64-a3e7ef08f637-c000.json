{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17344v1\", \"title\": \"Comparative Analysis of TELEMAC-2D Models on Agricultural Flood Damage\\n  Estimates\", \"summary\": \"Direct economic impacts of flooding are essential for flood mitigation\\npolicies, and are based upon multiple tools, among which 2D hydrodynamic\\nmodels. These models are dependent on multiple parameters and data, such as\\ntopography, and can yield considerably different results depending on their\\nvalues, ultimately changing the resultant damage estimation. To help in\\nunderstanding some of the underlying drivers of this variation, this conference\\npaper compares damage estimations issued by two different hydrodynamic models\\nof the Garonne River, near Marmande, in France. The influence of a\\ntopo-bathymetry projection method, which aims at reducing some interpolation\\nincoherencies, was also studied. The general conclusion is that these two\\nfactors, i.e., a change in the model parameters and the topo-bathymetry\\nprojection method, do matter but their influence on the total cost estimation\\nis highly dependent on the description of a few high-vulnerability agricultural\\nfields. Indeed, the latter often account for the majority of the total damage\\neven if occupying a fraction of the total area. This paper then advocates for a\\nmore vulnerability-based modelling approach, with a focus on the few\\nhigh-vulnerability areas.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.geo-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.geo-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T08:00:55Z\"}"}
