{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04995v1\", \"title\": \"The universal crossover from thermodynamics and dynamics of\\n  supercritical RN-AdS black hole\", \"summary\": \"We study the properties of supercritical Reissner-Nordstr\\\\\\\"om Anti-de Sitter\\n(RN-AdS) black holes in the extended phase space with the pressure defines as\\nthe cosmological constant. Supercritical black holes exist in the region where\\nboth temperature and pressure exceed the critical point, known as the\\nsupercritical region. The conventional view states that black holes in this\\nregime are indistinguishable between large and small phases. However, recent\\nresearch reveals that the supercritical regime exhibits universal gas-like and\\nliquid-like phase separation, which shed light on the study on the\\nsupercritical region of RN-AdS black holes in the extended phase space. In this\\nwork, we calculate the thermodynamic potential and quasinormal modes (QNMs) of\\nRN-AdS black holes, and identify transition curves between two different states\\nin supercritical region using thermodynamic and dynamic methods. On one hand,\\nwe find the thermodynamic crossover curve (Widom line) by defining the scaled\\nvariance $\\\\Omega$ (a higher-order derivative of Gibbs free energy). On the\\nother hand, we identify the dynamic crossover curve (Frenkel line) by analyzing\\ntransitions between distinct QNM decay modes.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.CO,hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:24:23Z\"}"}
