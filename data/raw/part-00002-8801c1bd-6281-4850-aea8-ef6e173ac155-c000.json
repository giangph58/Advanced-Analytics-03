We obtain the complete weight enumerators MacWilliams\\nidentity and the symmetrized weight enumerators MacWilliams identity based on\\nthe theory of theta function. We extend the main work by Bannai, Dougherty,\\nHarada and Oura to the finite ring $\\\\mathbb{Z}_k$ for any positive integer $k$\\nand present the complete weight enumerators MacWilliams identity in genus $g$.\\nWhen $k=p$ is a prime number, we establish the relationship between the theta\\nfunction of associated lattices over a cyclotomic field and the complete weight\\nenumerators with Hamming weight of codes, which is an analogy of the results by\\nG. Van der Geer and F. Hirzebruch since they showed the identity with the Lee\\nweight enumerators.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,cs.CR,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T03:07:48Z\"}"}
