We develop a model for the polarized\\nradio emission radiated from different heights in the pulsar magnetosphere and\\nexamine emission intensity distribution over the whole rotation phases of\\npulsars seen from all directions by the line of sight. We find that for pulsars\\nwith small periods and the magnetosphere filled with much more relativistic\\nparticles, the polarized radio emission can be generated in all rotation phases\\nfor both the aligned and perpendicular rotating neutron stars. When the line of\\nsight cuts the pulsar emission beam between the rotation and magnetic axes, the\\npolarization angles have the same sense of variation gradient for the ``main''\\npulse and ``interpulse''. If the line of sight cuts the beams between the\\ninclined magnetic axis and the equator, the opposite senses can be found for\\nthe main pulse and interpulse. In addition to the pulsed emission, we find\\npersistent radio emission generated in the pulsar magnetosphere. The model can\\nnaturally explain the emission across the entire rotation phases.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T03:00:39Z\"}"}
