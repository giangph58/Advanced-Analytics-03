{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04796v1\", \"title\": \"Long-range transverse momentum correlations and radial flow in Pb$-$Pb\\n  collisions at the LHC\", \"summary\": \"This Letter presents measurements of long-range transverse-momentum\\ncorrelations using a new observable, $v_{0}(p_\\\\mathrm{T})$, which serves as a\\nprobe of radial flow and medium properties in heavy-ion collisions. Results are\\nreported for inclusive charged particles, pions, kaons, and protons across\\nvarious centrality intervals in Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\\\\sqrt{s_\\\\mathrm{NN}} =\\n5.02$ TeV, recorded by the ALICE detector. A pseudorapidity-gap technique,\\nsimilar to that used in anisotropic-flow studies, is employed to suppress\\nshort-range correlations. At low $p_\\\\mathrm{T}$, a characteristic mass ordering\\nconsistent with hydrodynamic collective flow is observed. At higher\\n$p_\\\\mathrm{T}$ ($> 3$ GeV/$c$), protons exhibit larger $v_{0}(p_\\\\mathrm{T})$\\nthan pions and kaons, in agreement with expectations from quark-recombination\\nmodels. These results are sensitive to the bulk viscosity and the equation of\\nstate of the QCD medium formed in heavy-ion collisions.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-ex\", \"categories\": \"nucl-ex,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T07:39:49Z\"}"}
