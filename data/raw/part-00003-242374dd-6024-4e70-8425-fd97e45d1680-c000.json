However, we have observed that\\nexisting PEFT methods, which are often designed with natural imagery in mind,\\nstruggle when applied to Remote Sensing (RS) scenarios. This is primarily due\\nto their inability to handle artifact influences, a problem particularly severe\\nin RS image features. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Earth-Adapter, the\\nfirst PEFT method specifically designed for RS artifacts conquering.\\nEarth-Adapter introduces a novel Mixture of Frequency Adaptation process that\\ncombines a Mixture of Adapter (MoA) with Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT).\\nBy utilizing DFT, Earth-Adapter can decompose features into different frequency\\ncomponents, precisely separating artifacts from original features. The MoA then\\ndynamically assigns weights to each adapter expert, allowing for the\\ncombination of features across various frequency domains. These\\nsimple-yet-effective approaches enable Earth-Adapter to more efficiently\\novercome the disturbances caused by artifacts than previous PEFT methods,\\nsignificantly enhancing the FMs' performance on RS scenarios. Experiments on\\nDomain Adaptation (DA), and Domain Generalization (DG) semantic segmentation\\nbenchmarks showcase the Earth-Adapter's effectiveness. Compared with baseline\\nRein, Earth-Adapter significantly improves 9.0% mIoU in DA and 3.1% mIoU in DG\\nbenchmarks.
