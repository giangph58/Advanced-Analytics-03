A novel $\\\\alpha$-spectrum assignment is proposed for\\ndiscrete-time and continuous-time stochastic systems with multiplicative noise.\\nIn particular, $0$-spectrum assignment is equivalent to the pole assignment for\\nthe deterministic systems. The main contribution is two-fold: On the one hand,\\nwe present the conditions for $\\\\alpha$-spectrum assignment and the design of\\nfeedback controllers based on the system parameters. On the other hand, when\\nthe system parameters are unknown, we present a stochastic approximation\\nalgorithm to learn the feedback gains which guarantee the spectrum of the\\nstochastic systems to achieve the predetermined value. Numerical examples are\\nprovided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T13:25:09Z\"}"}
