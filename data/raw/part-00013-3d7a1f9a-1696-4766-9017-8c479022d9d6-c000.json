{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11215v1\", \"title\": \"Observational Study of Recurrent Jets: Evolution of Magnetic Flux,\\n  Current, and Helicity\", \"summary\": \"We observed three recurrent blowout jets in an active regio with Atmospheric\\nImaging Assembly (AIA) aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Using\\nHelioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI) data. We found that the magnetic flux of an\\nemerging negative pole increases steadily before declining just as the jets\\nerupt. Certain physical quantities, like the total unsigned vertical current,\\nalign with the periodicity of the jets. The differential affine velocity of the\\nvector magnetograms reveals strong shear around the negative pole. The Doppler\\nvelocity map, calculated from the H$\\\\alpha$ spectra observed by the Chinese\\nH$\\\\alpha$ Solar Explorer (CHASE), shows upflows with large initial velocity\\nbefore it can be observed by AIA. The magnetic field derived from the nonlinear\\nforce-free field (NLFFF) model suggests a topology akin to fan-spine structure,\\nconsistent with AIA images. We calculated the evolution of volumetric helicity\\nratio using the NLFFF model and found its phase aligns with the jet flux in AIA\\n171 \\\\AA. These results suggest that recurrent jets may be triggered by the\\naccumulation and release of energy and helicity, driven by emergence, shearing\\nand cancellation of photospheric magnetic field.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:17:09Z\"}"}
