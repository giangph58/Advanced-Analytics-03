In particular, we propose two augmented\\nLagrangian-based preconditioners to accelerate the convergence of iterative\\nsolvers for these two classes of linear. We consider two relevant examples to\\nillustrate the performance of these preconditioners when used in conjunction\\nwith flexible GMRES: the Poisson and the Stokes fictitious domain problems. A\\nspectral analysis is established for both exact and inexact versions of these\\npreconditioners. We show the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the\\nrobustness of our preconditioning strategy through extensive numerical tests in\\nboth two and three dimensions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:12:51Z\"}"}
