While cross-couplings from platform\\ndynamics generally degrade quantum measurements in a complex manner, navigation\\nfilters would need to be designed to handle such complex quantum sensor data.\\nIn this work, we report on the realization of a high-fidelity model of an\\natom-interferometry-based gravity gradiometer and demonstrate its integration\\nwith a map-matching navigation filter. Relying on the ability of our model to\\nsimulate the sensor behaviour across various dynamic platform environments, we\\nshow that aiding navigation via map matching using quantum gravity gradiometry\\nresults in stable trajectories, and highlight the importance of non-Gaussian\\nerrors arising from platform dynamics as a key challenge to map-matching\\nnavigation. We derive requirements for mitigating these errors, such as\\nmaintaining sensor tilt below 3.3 degrees, to inform future sensor development\\npriorities. This work demonstrates the value of an end-to-end approach that\\ncould support future optimization of the overall navigation system. Beyond\\nnavigation, our atom interferometer modelling framework could be relevant to\\ncurrent research and innovation endeavours with quantum gravimeters,\\ngradiometers and inertial sensors.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T12:07:21Z\"}"}
