{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06069v1\", \"title\": \"Physics-Constrained Neural Network for Metasurface Optical Response\\n  Prediction\", \"summary\": \"A physics-constrained neural network is presented for predicting the optical\\nresponse of metasurfaces. Our approach incorporates physical laws directly into\\nthe neural network architecture and loss function, addressing critical\\nchallenges in the modeling of metasurfaces. Unlike methods that require\\nspecialized weighting strategies or separate architectural branches to handle\\ndifferent data regimes and phase wrapping discontinuities, this unified\\napproach effectively addresses phase discontinuities, energy conservation\\nconstraints, and complex gap-dependent behavior. We implement sine-cosine phase\\nrepresentation with Euclidean normalization as a non-trainable layer within the\\nnetwork, enabling the model to account for the periodic nature of phase while\\nenforcing the mathematical constraint $\\\\sin^2 \\\\phi + \\\\cos^2 \\\\phi = 1$. A\\nEuclidean distance-based loss function in the sine-cosine space ensures a\\nphysically meaningful error metric while preventing discontinuity issues. The\\nmodel achieves good, consistent performance with small, imbalanced datasets of\\n580 and 1075 data points, compared to several thousand typically required by\\nalternative approaches. This physics-informed approach preserves physical\\ninterpretability while reducing reliance on large datasets and could be\\nextended to other photonic structures by incorporating additional physical\\nconstraints tailored to specific applications.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:10:28Z\"}"}
