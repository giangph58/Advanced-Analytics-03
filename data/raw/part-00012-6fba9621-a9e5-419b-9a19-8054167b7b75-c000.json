Central to many of these\\nadvancements are precisely tuned neural architectures that are tailored to the\\ndomains in which they are used. In this work, we develop deep learning\\ntechniques and architectural modifications that improve performance on\\nreinforcement learning guided quantum circuit synthesis-the task of\\nconstructing a circuit that implements a given unitary matrix. First, we\\npropose a global phase invariance operation which makes our architecture\\nresilient to complex global phase shifts. Second, we demonstrate how augmenting\\ndata with small random unitary perturbations during training enables more\\nrobust learning. Finally, we show how encoding numerical data with techniques\\nfrom image processing allow networks to better detect small but significant\\nchanges in data. Our work enables deep learning approaches to better synthesize\\nquantum circuits that implement unitary matrices.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T15:51:32Z\"}"}
