To this end, two\\nquasi-incompressible diffuse interface models with singular free energies are\\nanalyzed, differing primarily in their velocity averaging. Firstly, to\\ngeneralize a model by Abels, Garcke, and Gr\\\\\\\"un, a thermodynamically consistent\\nsystem of Navier--Stokes/Cahn--Hilliard type with source terms is derived in a\\nframework of continuum fluid dynamics, followed by a proof of existence of weak\\nsolutions to the latter. Secondly, the quasi-stationary version of a model by\\nAki, Dreyer, Giesselmann, and Kraus is investigated analytically, with\\nexistence of weak solutions being established for the resulting\\nquasi-stationary Stokes system coupled to a Cahn--Hilliard equation with a\\nsource term.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T16:15:31Z\"}"}
