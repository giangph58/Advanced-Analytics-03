First, we rigorously justify Koiter's\\nmodel for linearly elastic elliptic membrane shells in the case where the shell\\nis subject to a geometrical constraint modelled via a normal compliance contact\\ncondition defined in the interior of the shell. To achieve this, we establish a\\nnovel density result for non-empty, closed, and convex subsets of Lebesgue\\nspaces, which are applicable to cases not covered by the ``density property''\\nestablished in [Ciarlet, Mardare \\\\& Piersanti, \\\\emph{Math. Mech. Solids},\\n2019].\\n  Second, we demonstrate that the solution to the two-dimensional obstacle\\nproblem for linearly elastic elliptic membrane shells, subjected to the\\ninterior normal compliance contact condition, exhibits higher regularity\\nthroughout its entire definition domain. A key feature of this result is that,\\nwhile the transverse component of the solution is, in general, only of class\\n$L^2$ and its trace is \\\\emph{a priori} undefined, the methodology proposed\\nhere, partially based on [Ciarlet \\\\& Sanchez-Palencia, \\\\emph{J. Math. Pures\\nAppl.}, 1996], enables us to rigorously establish the well-posedness of the\\ntrace for the transverse component of the solution by means of an \\\\emph{ad hoc}\\nformula.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T13:40:11Z\"}"}
