{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17476v1\", \"title\": \"Implicit Sub-stepping Scheme for Critical State Soil Models\", \"summary\": \"The stress integration of critical soil model is usually based on implicit\\nEuler algorithm, where the stress predictor is corrected by employing a return\\nmapping algorithm. In the case of large load step, the solution of local\\nnonlinear system to compute the plastic multiplier may not be attained. To\\novercome this problem, a sub-stepping scheme shall be used to improve the\\nconvergence of the local nonlin- ear system solution strategy. Nevertheless,\\nthe complexity of the tangent operator of the sub-stepping scheme is high. This\\ncomplicates the use of Newton-Raphson algorithm to obtain global quadratic\\nconvergence. In this paper, a formulation for consistent tangent operator is\\ndeveloped for implicit sub-stepping integration for the modified Cam-Clay model\\nand unified Clay and Sand model. This formulation is highly efficient and can\\nbe used with problem involving large load step, such as tun- nel simulation.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T12:08:01Z\"}"}
