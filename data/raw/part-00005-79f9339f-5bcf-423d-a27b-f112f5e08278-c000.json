These methods overcome\\ncommon concerns about reproducibility and costliness involved in the\\nlabor-intensive process of human qualitative analysis. However, two major\\nlimitations of topic models are their interpretability and their practicality\\nfor answering targeted, domain-specific social science research questions. In\\nthis work, we investigate opportunities for using LLM-generated text\\naugmentation to improve the usefulness of topic modeling output. We use a\\npolitical science case study to evaluate our results in a domain-specific\\napplication, and find that topic modeling using GPT-4 augmentations creates\\nhighly interpretable categories that can be used to investigate domain-specific\\nresearch questions with minimal human guidance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T11:14:13Z\"}"}
