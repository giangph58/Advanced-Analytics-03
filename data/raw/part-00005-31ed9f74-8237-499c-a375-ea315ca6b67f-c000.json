Extensive model grids from PHOENIX,\\na generalized non-LTE 1D and 3D stellar atmosphere code, have found widespread\\nuse in the astronomical community, however current PHOENIX/1D models have been\\nsubstantially improved over the last decade. To make these improvements\\navailable to the community, we have constructed the NewEra LTE model grid\\nconsisting of 37438 models with $2300K \\\\leq T_{eff} \\\\leq 12000K$, $0.0\\\\le\\nlog{(g)} \\\\le 6.0$ metallicities [M/H] from $-4.0$ to $+0.5$, and for\\nmetallicities $-2.0 \\\\le [M/H] \\\\le 0.0$ additional $\\\\alpha$ element variations\\nfrom $-0.2 \\\\le [\\\\alpha/{\\\\rm Fe}] \\\\le +1.2$ are included. The models use\\ndatabases of 851 million atomic lines and 834 billion molecular lines and\\nemploy the Astrophysical Chemical Equilibrium Solver for the equation of state.\\nAll models in the NewEra grid have been calculated in spherical symmetry\\nbecause center-to-limb variation differences from plane-parallel models are\\nquite large for giants and not insignificant for dwarfs. All model data are\\nprovided in the Hierarchical Data Format 5 (HDF5) format, including low and\\nhigh sampling rate spectra. These files also include a variety of details about\\nthe models, such as the exact abundances and isotopic patterns used and results\\nof the atomic and molecular line selection. Although the model structures have\\nsmall differences with the previous grid generation, the spectra show\\nsignificant differences, mostly due to the updates of the molecular line lists.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:23:02Z\"}"}
