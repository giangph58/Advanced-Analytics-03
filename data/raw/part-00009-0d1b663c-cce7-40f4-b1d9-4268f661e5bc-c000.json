This foundational quantum-mechanical\\nphenomenon, known as the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect, has become a cornerstone\\nin the field of quantum information. It also extends to many indistinguishable\\nparticles, resulting in complex interference patterns. However, despite of its\\nfundamental and applied interest, the many-particle effect has only been\\nobserved in notoriously lossy photonic systems, but a realization with atomic\\nsystems has remained elusive until now. Here, we demonstrate HOM interference\\nwith up to 12 indistinguishable neutral atoms in a system with negligible loss.\\nOur single-particle counting clearly reveals parity oscillations, a bunching\\nenvelope and genuine multi-partite entanglement, defining features of the\\nmulti-particle HOM effect. Our technique offers the potential for scaling to\\nmuch larger numbers, presenting promising applications in quantum information\\nwith indistinguishable particles and Heisenberg-limited atom interferometry.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:30:05Z\"}"}
