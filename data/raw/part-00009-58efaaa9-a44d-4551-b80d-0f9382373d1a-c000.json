To address\\nthe issue, this paper proposes a Data Augmentation Partial Least Squares\\nRegression (DAPLSR) model via manifold optimization. The DAPLSR model\\nintroduces the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to increase\\nthe number of samples and utilizes the Value Difference Metric (VDM) to select\\nthe nearest neighbor samples that closely resemble the original samples for\\ngenerating synthetic samples. In solving the model, in order to obtain a more\\naccurate numerical solution for PLSR, this paper proposes a manifold\\noptimization method that uses the geometric properties of the constraint space\\nto improve model degradation and optimization. Comprehensive experiments show\\nthat the proposed DAPLSR model achieves superior classification performance and\\noutstanding evaluation metrics on various datasets, significantly outperforming\\nexisting methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T11:58:28Z\"}"}
