The inverse problem of finding a\\nmaterial microstructure that leads to given bulk properties is of great\\ninterest in mechanics and materials science. These inverse design tasks often\\nrequire a large dataset, which can become unaffordable when considering\\nmaterial behavior that requires more expensive simulations or experiments. We\\ngenerate a data-efficient surrogate for the mapping between the characteristics\\nof the local material structure and the effective elasticity tensor and use it\\nto inversely design structures with multiple objectives simultaneously. The\\npresented neural network-based surrogate model achieves its data efficiency by\\ninherently satisfying certain requirements, such as equivariance with respect\\nto permutations of structure parameters, which avoids having to learn them from\\ndata. The resulting surrogate of the forward model is differentiable, allowing\\nits direct use in gradient-based optimization for the inverse design problem.\\nWe demonstrate in three inverse design tasks of varying complexity that this\\napproach yields reliable results while requiring significantly less training\\ndata than previous approaches based on neural-network surrogates. This paves\\nthe way for inverse design involving nonlinear mechanical behavior, where data\\nefficiency is currently the limiting factor.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CE\", \"categories\": \"cs.CE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T10:42:51Z\"}"}
