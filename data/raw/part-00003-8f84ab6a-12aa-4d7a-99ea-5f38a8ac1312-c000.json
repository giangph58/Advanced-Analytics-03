{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14920v1\", \"title\": \"DyFo: A Training-Free Dynamic Focus Visual Search for Enhancing LMMs in\\n  Fine-Grained Visual Understanding\", \"summary\": \"Humans can effortlessly locate desired objects in cluttered environments,\\nrelying on a cognitive mechanism known as visual search to efficiently filter\\nout irrelevant information and focus on task-related regions. Inspired by this\\nprocess, we propose Dyfo (Dynamic Focus), a training-free dynamic focusing\\nvisual search method that enhances fine-grained visual understanding in large\\nmultimodal models (LMMs). Unlike existing approaches which require additional\\nmodules or data collection, Dyfo leverages a bidirectional interaction between\\nLMMs and visual experts, using a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to\\nsimulate human-like focus adjustments. This enables LMMs to focus on key visual\\nregions while filtering out irrelevant content, without introducing additional\\ntraining caused by vocabulary expansion or the integration of specialized\\nlocalization modules. Experimental results demonstrate that Dyfo significantly\\nimproves fine-grained visual understanding and reduces hallucination issues in\\nLMMs, achieving superior performance across both fixed and dynamic resolution\\nmodels.
