{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19573v1\", \"title\": \"Existence of Friedrich-Wintgen bound states in the continuum: system of\\n  Schr\\u00f6dinger equations\", \"summary\": \"A bound state in the continuum (BIC) is an eigenmode with the corresponding\\neigenvalue embedded in the continuous spectrum. There is currently a\\nsignificant research interest on BICs in the photonics community, because they\\ncan be used to induce strong resonances that are useful for lasing, sensing,\\nharmonic generation, etc. The existence of BICs in classical or quantum wave\\nsystems has only been established for some relatively simple cases such as BICs\\nprotected by symmetry. In 1985, Friedrich and Wintgen (Physical Review A, Vol.\\n32, pp. 3232-3242, 1985) suggested that BICs may appear from the destructive\\ninterference of two resonances coupled to a single radiation channel. They used\\na system of three one-dimensional Schr\\\\\\\"{o}dinger equations to illustrate this\\nprocess. Many BICs in classical wave systems seem to follow this mechanism and\\nare now called Friedrich-Wintgen BICs. However, Friedrich and Wintgen did not\\nshow the existence of BICs in their system of three Schr\\\\\\\"{o}dinger equations.\\nInstead, they approximated the original system by a model with one\\nSchr\\\\\\\"{o}dinger equation and two algebraic equations, and only analyzed BICs in\\nthe approximate model. In this paper, we give a rigorous justification for the\\nexistence of BICs in the original system of three 1D Schr\\\\\\\"{o}dinger equations.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T08:33:04Z\"}"}
