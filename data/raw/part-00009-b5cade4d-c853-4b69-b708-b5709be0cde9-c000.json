{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05084v1\", \"title\": \"Reliably Bounding False Positives: A Zero-Shot Machine-Generated Text\\n  Detection Framework via Multiscaled Conformal Prediction\", \"summary\": \"The rapid advancement of large language models has raised significant\\nconcerns regarding their potential misuse by malicious actors. As a result,\\ndeveloping effective detectors to mitigate these risks has become a critical\\npriority. However, most existing detection methods focus excessively on\\ndetection accuracy, often neglecting the societal risks posed by high false\\npositive rates (FPRs). This paper addresses this issue by leveraging Conformal\\nPrediction (CP), which effectively constrains the upper bound of FPRs. While\\ndirectly applying CP constrains FPRs, it also leads to a significant reduction\\nin detection performance. To overcome this trade-off, this paper proposes a\\nZero-Shot Machine-Generated Text Detection Framework via Multiscaled Conformal\\nPrediction (MCP), which both enforces the FPR constraint and improves detection\\nperformance. This paper also introduces RealDet, a high-quality dataset that\\nspans a wide range of domains, ensuring realistic calibration and enabling\\nsuperior detection performance when combined with MCP. Empirical evaluations\\ndemonstrate that MCP effectively constrains FPRs, significantly enhances\\ndetection performance, and increases robustness against adversarial attacks\\nacross multiple detectors and datasets.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T09:32:38Z\"}"}
