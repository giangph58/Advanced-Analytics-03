We present a novel\\ndisturbance-adaptive model predictive control (DAD-MPC) framework, which\\nadjusts the disturbance model based on measured constraint violations. Using a\\nrobust invariance method, DAD-MPC ensures recursive feasibility and guarantees\\nasymptotic or robust bounds on average constraint violations. Additionally, the\\nbounds hold even with an inaccurate disturbance model, which allows for\\ndata-driven disturbance quantification methods to be used, such as conformal\\nprediction. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach\\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods while satisfying average violation\\nconstraints.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:49:00Z\"}"}
