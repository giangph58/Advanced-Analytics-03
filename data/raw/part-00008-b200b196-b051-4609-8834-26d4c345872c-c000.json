This has led\\nto great interest in the silicon-vacancy center as well as in the other group\\nIV vacancy centers. In this work, we model the charge cycle of the group IV\\nvacancy centers from the $-2$ to $0$ charge state. As a first step, we compute\\nthe onset energies for all relevant one- and two-step ionization processes.\\nBased on these results, we then derive the rate equations using Fermi's golden\\nrule.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.atom-ph,physics.comp-ph,physics.optics,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T12:48:07Z\"}"}
