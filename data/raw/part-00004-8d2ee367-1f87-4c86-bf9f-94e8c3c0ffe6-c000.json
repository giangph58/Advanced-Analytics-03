Under the\\nassumptions that the system is dissipative and the origin is a repeller, the\\nglobal dynamics of such systems is investigated. A (weakly) type-K retrotone\\nmap is defined on a bounded set, which is backward monotone in some order.\\nUnder certain conditions, the dynamics of a type-K competitive system is the\\ndynamics of a type-K retrotone map. Under these conditions, there exists a\\ncompact invariant set A that is the global attractor of the system on the\\nnonnegative orthant exluding the origin. Some basic properties of A are\\nestablished and remaining problems are listed for further investigation for\\ngeneral N-dimensional systems. These problems are completely solved for planar\\ntype-K competitive systems: every forward orbit is eventually monotone and\\nconverges to a fixed point; the global attractor A consists of two monotone\\ncurves each of which is a one-dimensional compact invariant manifold. A\\nconcrete example is provided to demonstrate the results for planar systems.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T16:28:43Z\"}"}
