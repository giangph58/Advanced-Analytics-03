{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07577v1\", \"title\": \"Optimization Of The Survival Threshold For Anisotropic Logistic\\n  Equations With Mixed Boundary Conditions\", \"summary\": \"In this paper we study a reaction diffusion problem with anisotropic\\ndiffusion and mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions on the boundary of\\nthe domain. First, we prove that the parabolic problem has a unique positive,\\nbounded solution. Then, we show that this solution converges as t tends to\\ninfinity to the unique nonnegative solution of the elliptic associated problem.\\nThe existence of the unique positive solution to this problem depends on a\\nprincipal eigenvalue of a suitable linearized problem with a sign-changing\\nweights. Next, we study the minimization of such eigenvalue with respect to the\\nsign-changing weight, showing that there exists an optimal bang-bang weight,\\nnamely a piece-wise constant weight that takes only two values. Finally, we\\ncompletely solve the problem in dimension one.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T09:20:34Z\"}"}
