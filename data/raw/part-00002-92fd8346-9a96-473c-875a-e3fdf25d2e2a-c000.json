{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11243v1\", \"title\": \"Towards Automated Safety Requirements Derivation Using Agent-based RAG\", \"summary\": \"We study the automated derivation of safety requirements in a self-driving\\nvehicle use case, leveraging LLMs in combination with agent-based\\nretrieval-augmented generation. Conventional approaches that utilise\\npre-trained LLMs to assist in safety analyses typically lack domain-specific\\nknowledge. Existing RAG approaches address this issue, yet their performance\\ndeteriorates when handling complex queries and it becomes increasingly harder\\nto retrieve the most relevant information. This is particularly relevant for\\nsafety-relevant applications. In this paper, we propose the use of agent-based\\nRAG to derive safety requirements and show that the retrieved information is\\nmore relevant to the queries. We implement an agent-based approach on a\\ndocument pool of automotive standards and the Apollo case study, as a\\nrepresentative example of an automated driving perception system. Our solution\\nis tested on a data set of safety requirement questions and answers, extracted\\nfrom the Apollo data. Evaluating a set of selected RAG metrics, we present and\\ndiscuss advantages of a agent-based approach compared to default RAG methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.CL,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:43:19Z\"}"}
