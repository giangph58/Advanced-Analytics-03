{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05370v1\", \"title\": \"Walrus: An Efficient Decentralized Storage Network\", \"summary\": \"Decentralized storage systems face a fundamental trade-off between\\nreplication overhead, recovery efficiency, and security guarantees. Current\\napproaches either rely on full replication, incurring substantial storage\\ncosts, or employ trivial erasure coding schemes that struggle with efficient\\nrecovery especially under high storage-node churn. We present Walrus, a novel\\ndecentralized blob storage system that addresses these limitations through\\nmultiple technical innovations. At the core of Walrus is RedStuff, a\\ntwo-dimensional erasure coding protocol that achieves high security with only\\n4.5x replication factor, while enabling self-healing recovery that requires\\nbandwidth proportional to only the lost data $(O(|blob|/n)$ versus $O(|blob|)$\\nin traditional systems). Crucially, RedStuff is the first protocol to support\\nstorage challenges in asynchronous networks, preventing adversaries from\\nexploiting network delays to pass verification without actually storing data.\\nWalrus also introduces a novel multi-stage epoch change protocol that\\nefficiently handles storage node churn while maintaining uninterrupted\\navailability during committee transitions. Our system incorporates\\nauthenticated data structures to defend against malicious clients and ensures\\ndata consistency throughout storage and retrieval processes. Experimental\\nevaluation demonstrates that Walrus achieves practical performance at scale,\\nmaking it suitable for a wide range of decentralized applications requiring\\nhigh-integrity, available blob storage with reasonable overhead.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC,cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T16:06:41Z\"}"}
