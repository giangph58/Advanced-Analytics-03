These extensions correspond to the smallest elements above $M$ in\\nthe poset defined by the dependency order. We apply our algorithm to several\\nclassical configurations: the V\\\\'amos matroid, the unique Steiner quadruple\\nsystem $S(3,4,8)$, the projective and affine planes, the dual of the Fano\\nmatroid, and the dual of the graphic matroid of $K_{3,3}$. In each case, we\\ncompute the minimal irreducible decomposition of their circuit varieties.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,cs.SC,math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T11:47:56Z\"}"}
