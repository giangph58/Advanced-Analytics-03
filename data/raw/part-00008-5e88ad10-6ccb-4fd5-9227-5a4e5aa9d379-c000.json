{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17473v1\", \"title\": \"Wolves in the Repository: A Software Engineering Analysis of the XZ\\n  Utils Supply Chain Attack\", \"summary\": \"The digital economy runs on Open Source Software (OSS), with an estimated\\n90\\\\% of modern applications containing open-source components. While this\\nwidespread adoption has revolutionized software development, it has also\\ncreated critical security vulnerabilities, particularly in essential but\\nunder-resourced projects. This paper examines a sophisticated attack on the XZ\\nUtils project (CVE-2024-3094), where attackers exploited not just code, but the\\nentire open-source development process to inject a backdoor into a fundamental\\nLinux compression library. Our analysis reveals a new breed of supply chain\\nattack that manipulates software engineering practices themselves -- from\\ncommunity management to CI/CD configurations -- to establish legitimacy and\\nmaintain long-term control. Through a comprehensive examination of GitHub\\nevents and development artifacts, we reconstruct the attack timeline, analyze\\nthe evolution of attacker tactics. Our findings demonstrate how attackers\\nleveraged seemingly beneficial contributions to project infrastructure and\\nmaintenance to bypass traditional security measures. This work extends beyond\\ntraditional security analysis by examining how software engineering practices\\nthemselves can be weaponized, offering insights for protecting the open-source\\necosystem.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE,cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T12:06:11Z\"}"}
