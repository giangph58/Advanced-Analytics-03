{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12907v1\", \"title\": \"De-jittering Ariel: an optimized algorithm\", \"summary\": \"The European Space Agency's Ariel mission, scheduled for launch in 2029, aims\\nto conduct the first large-scale survey of atmospheric spectra of transiting\\nexoplanets. Ariel achieves the high photometric stability on transit timescales\\nrequired to detect the spectroscopic signatures of chemical elements with a\\npayload design optimized for transit photometry that either eliminates known\\nsystematics or allows for their removal during data processing without\\nsignificantly degrading or biasing the detection. Jitter in the spacecraft's\\nline of sight is a source of disturbance when measuring the spectra of\\nexoplanet atmospheres. We describe an improved algorithm for de-jittering Ariel\\nobservations simulated in the time domain. We opt for an approach based on the\\nspatial information on the Point Spread Function (PSF) distortion from jitter\\nto detrend the optical signals. The jitter model is based on representative\\nsimulations from Airbus Defence and Space, the prime contractor for the Ariel\\nservice module. We investigate the precision and biases of the retrieved\\natmospheric spectra from the jitter-detrended observations. At long\\nwavelengths, the photometric stability of the Ariel spectrometer is already\\ndominated by photon noise. Our algorithm effectively de-jitters both\\nphotometric and spectroscopic data, ensuring that the performance remains\\nphoton noise-limited across the entire Ariel spectrum, fully compliant with\\nmission requirements. This work contributes to the development of the data\\nreduction pipeline for Ariel, aligning with its scientific goals, and may also\\nbenefit other astronomical telescopes and instrumentation.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T12:55:46Z\"}"}
