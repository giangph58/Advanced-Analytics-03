They are obtained from the information frames\\nconsidered in \\\\cite{sp21} by omitting the conservativity requirement.\\nInformation frames generalise Scott's information systems~\\\\cite{sc82}: Instead\\nof the global consistency predicate, there is now a local consistency predicate\\nfor each token. Strong information frames are obtained by strengthening the\\nconditions for these predicates. Let $\\\\CIF$ and $\\\\SIF$ be the corresponding\\ncategories.\\n  In \\\\cite{sxx08} another generalisation of Scott's information systems was\\nintroduced which also exactly captures all continuous domains. As shown in\\n\\\\cite{hzl15}, the definition can be simplified while maintaining the\\nrepresentation result. Let $\\\\CIS$ and $\\\\SCIS$ be the corresponding categories.\\nIt is shown that all these categories are equivalent. Moreover, the equivalence\\nextends to the subcategories of (strong) continuous information frames with\\ntruth elements. Such information frames capture exactly all pointed continuous\\ndomains.\\n  Continuous information frames are families of rudimentary logics, associated\\nwith each token is a local consistency predicate and an entailment relation.\\nHowever, they lack the expressive power of propositional logic. In an attempt\\nto make each of this logics more expressible, continuous stratified conjunctive\\nlogics are introduced. These are families of conjunctive logics. The category\\n$\\\\CSL$ of such logics is shown to be isomorphic to $\\\\SIF_{\\\\bt}$, the category\\nof strong continuous information frames with a truth element.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LO\", \"categories\": \"cs.LO,F.3.1\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T15:38:59Z\"}"}
