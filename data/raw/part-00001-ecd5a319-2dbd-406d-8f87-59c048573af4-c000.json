The discrete ansatz space\\nincludes degrees of freedom in $n-2$ dimensional submanifolds (e.g., nodal\\nvalues in 2D and edge values in 3D), in addition to the typical degrees of\\nfreedom in the mesh and on the hyperfaces in the HHO literature. This approach\\nenables the characteristic commuting property of the hybrid high-order\\nmethodology in any space dimension and allows for lower eigenvalue bounds of\\nhigher order for the eigenvalue problem. The main results are quasi-best\\napproximation estimates as well as reliable and efficient error control. The\\nlatter motivates an adaptive mesh-refining algorithm that empirically recovers\\noptimal convergence rates for singular solutions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T10:46:21Z\"}"}
