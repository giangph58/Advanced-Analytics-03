{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13178v1\", \"title\": \"Aligning Constraint Generation with Design Intent in Parametric CAD\", \"summary\": \"We adapt alignment techniques from reasoning LLMs to the task of generating\\nengineering sketch constraints found in computer-aided design (CAD) models.\\nEngineering sketches consist of geometric primitives (e.g. points, lines)\\nconnected by constraints (e.g. perpendicular, tangent) that define the\\nrelationships between them. For a design to be easily editable, the constraints\\nmust effectively capture design intent, ensuring the geometry updates\\npredictably when parameters change. Although current approaches can generate\\nCAD designs, an open challenge remains to align model outputs with design\\nintent, we label this problem `design alignment'. A critical first step towards\\naligning generative CAD models is to generate constraints which fully-constrain\\nall geometric primitives, without over-constraining or distorting sketch\\ngeometry. Using alignment techniques to train an existing constraint generation\\nmodel with feedback from a constraint solver, we are able to fully-constrain\\n93% of sketches compared to 34% when using a na\\\\\\\"ive supervised fine-tuning\\n(SFT) baseline and only 8.9% without alignment. Our approach can be applied to\\nany existing constraint generation model and sets the stage for further\\nresearch bridging alignment strategies between the language and design domains.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:59:54Z\"}"}
