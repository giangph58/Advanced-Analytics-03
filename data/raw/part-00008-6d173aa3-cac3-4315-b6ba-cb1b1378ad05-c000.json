A continuous-time model incorporating universal series-parallel\\nstator winding connection and radial permanent magnet fluxes is developed in\\nthe stator variables and transformed into the rotor reference frame, including\\nalso the electromagnetic torque. The transformed model undergoes discretization\\nusing the matrix exponential-based technique, wherein the electrical angular\\nvelocity and angle are considered time-varying parameters. The resulting model\\nis subsequently expanded to consider the motor connection resistance via\\nperturbation techniques. In the laboratory experiments, we validate the\\ndynamical properties of the derived model by comparing its outputs with the\\nexperimental data and waveforms generated by the forward Euler-based\\ndiscrete-time approximation.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T15:47:31Z\"}"}
