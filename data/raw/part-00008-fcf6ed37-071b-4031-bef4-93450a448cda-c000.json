To account for perturbation due to odd-parity E1 operator on the atomic\\norbitals, calculations are carried out in the linear response approach. Our\\nfinal $\\\\alpha_d$ values, with the estimated uncertainties, show reasonably good\\nagreement with the previous calculations and available experimental results.\\nDifferences among the DHF, MBPT(2), MBPT(3) and RPA results indicate\\npair-correlation (PC) effects play major roles than the core-polarization (CP)\\neffects in the determination of $\\\\alpha_d$ values in Cs. From the differences\\namong the MBPT(3) and RCC results, we find correlations among the PC and CP\\neffects and double CP effects together are also significant in these\\ncalculations. Contributions from the Breit interactions are found to be quite\\nlarge in the high-lying states.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T07:10:28Z\"}"}
