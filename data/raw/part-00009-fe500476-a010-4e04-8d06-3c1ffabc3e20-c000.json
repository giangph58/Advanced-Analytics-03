{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20680v1\", \"title\": \"Overcoming Quadratic Hardware Scaling for a Fully Connected Digital\\n  Oscillatory Neural Network\", \"summary\": \"Computing with coupled oscillators or oscillatory neural networks (ONNs) has\\nrecently attracted a lot of interest due to their potential for massive\\nparallelism and energy-efficient computing. However, to date, ONNs have\\nprimarily been explored either analytically or through analog circuit\\nimplementations. This paper shifts the focus to the digital implementation of\\nONNs, examining various design architectures. We first report on an existing\\ndigital ONN design based on a recurrent architecture. The major challenge for\\nscaling such recurrent architectures is the quadratic increase in coupling\\nhardware with the network size. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a\\nnovel hybrid architecture that balances serialization and parallelism in the\\ncoupling elements that shows near-linear hardware scaling, on the order of\\nabout 1.2 with the network size. Furthermore, we evaluate the benefits and\\ncosts of these different digital ONN architectures in terms time to solution\\nand resource usage on FPGA emulation. The proposed hybrid architecture allows\\nfor a 10.5$\\\\times$ increase in the number of oscillators while using 5-bits to\\nrepresent the coupling weights and 4-bits to represent the oscillator phase on\\na Zynq-7020 FPGA board. The near-linear scaling is a major step towards\\nimplementing large scale ONN architectures. To the best of our knowledge, this\\nwork presents the largest fully connected digital ONN architecture implemented\\nthus far with a total of 506 fully connected oscillators.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AR\", \"categories\": \"cs.AR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T12:01:33Z\"}"}
