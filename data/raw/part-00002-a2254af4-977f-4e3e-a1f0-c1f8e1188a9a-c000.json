These interactions are referred to as nonlocal\\ninteractions and are often modeled using spatial convolution with an\\nappropriate integral kernel. Many evolution equations incorporating nonlocal\\ninteractions have been proposed. In such equations, the behavior of the system\\nand the patterns it generates can be controlled by modifying the shape of the\\nintegral kernel. However, the presence of nonlocality poses challenges for\\nmathematical analysis. To address these difficulties, we develop an\\napproximation method that converts nonlocal effects into spatially local\\ndynamics using reaction-diffusion systems. In this paper, we present an\\napproximation method for nonlocal interactions in evolution equations based on\\na linear sum of solutions to a reaction-diffusion system in high-dimensional\\nEuclidean space up to three dimensions. The key aspect of this approach is\\nidentifying a class of integral kernels that can be approximated by a linear\\ncombination of specific Green functions in the case of high-dimensional spaces.\\nThis enables us to demonstrate that any nonlocal interactions can be\\napproximated by a linear sum of auxiliary diffusive substances. Our results\\nestablish a connection between a broad class of nonlocal interactions and\\ndiffusive chemical reactions in dynamical systems.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T15:41:18Z\"}"}
