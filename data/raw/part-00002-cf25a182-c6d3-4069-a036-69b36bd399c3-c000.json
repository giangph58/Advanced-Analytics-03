We propose HSANet, a network that uses hierarchical\\nconvolution to extract multi-scale features. It incorporates hybrid\\nself-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to learn and fuse global and\\ncross-scale information. This enables HSANet to capture global context at\\ndifferent scales and integrate cross-scale features, refining edge details and\\nimproving detection performance. We will also open-source our model code:\\nhttps://github.com/ChengxiHAN/HSANet.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T15:23:59Z\"}"}
