{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07493v1\", \"title\": \"Quickest change detection for UAV-based sensing\", \"summary\": \"This paper addresses the problem of quickest change detection (QCD) at two\\nspatially separated locations monitored by a single unmanned aerial vehicle\\n(UAV) equipped with a sensor. At any location, the UAV observes i.i.d. data\\nsequentially in discrete time instants. The distribution of the observation\\ndata changes at some unknown, arbitrary time and the UAV has to detect this\\nchange in the shortest possible time. Change can occur at most at one location\\nover the entire infinite time horizon. The UAV switches between these two\\nlocations in order to quickly detect the change. To this end, we propose\\nLocation Switching and Change Detection (LS-CD) algorithm which uses a repeated\\none-sided sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) based mechanism for\\nobservation-driven location switching and change detection. The primary goal is\\nto minimize the worst-case average detection delay (WADD) while meeting\\nconstraints on the average run length to false alarm (ARL2FA) and the UAV's\\ntime-averaged energy consumption. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of\\nthe algorithm's performance by using theory of random walk. Specifically, we\\nderive tight upper and lower bounds to its ARL2FA and a tight upper bound to\\nits WADD. In the special case of a symmetrical setting, our analysis leads to a\\nnew asymptotic upper bound to the ARL2FA of the standard CUSUM algorithm, a\\nnovel contribution not available in the literature, to our knowledge. Numerical\\nsimulations demonstrate the efficacy of LS-CD.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T06:49:55Z\"}"}
