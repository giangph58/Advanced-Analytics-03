This work proposes a flexible language-based framework to adapt\\ngeneric robotic trajectories produced by off-the-shelf motion planners like\\nRRT, A-star, etc, or learned from human demonstrations. We utilize pre-trained\\nLLMs to adapt trajectory waypoints by generating code as a policy for dense\\nrobot manipulation, enabling more complex and flexible instructions than\\ncurrent methods. This approach allows us to incorporate a broader range of\\ncommands, including numerical inputs. Compared to state-of-the-art\\nfeature-based sequence-to-sequence models which require training, our method\\ndoes not require task-specific training and offers greater interpretability and\\nmore effective feedback mechanisms. We validate our approach through simulation\\nexperiments on the robotic manipulator, aerial vehicle, and ground robot in the\\nPybullet and Gazebo simulation environments, demonstrating that LLMs can\\nsuccessfully adapt trajectories to complex human instructions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T08:48:23Z\"}"}
