{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10279v1\", \"title\": \"Elastic Planetoids\", \"summary\": \"Modeling the internal structure of self-gravitating solid and liquid bodies\\npresents a challenge, as existing approaches are often limited to either overly\\nsimplistic constant-density approximations or more complex numerical equations\\nof state. We present a detailed analysis of a tractable and physically\\nmotivated model for perfectly elastic, spherically symmetric self-gravitating\\nbodies in hydrostatic equilibrium. The model employs a logarithmic equation of\\nstate (logotropic EOS) with a non-zero initial density and constant bulk\\nmodulus. Importantly, scaling properties of the model allow all solutions to be\\nderived from a single, universal solution of an ordinary differential equation,\\nresembling the Lane-Emden and Chandrasekhar models. The model provides new\\ninsights into stability issues and reveals oscillatory asymptotic behavior in\\nthe mass-radius relation, including the existence of both a maximum mass and a\\nmaximum radius. We derive useful, simple analytical approximations for key\\nproperties, such as central overdensity, moment of inertia, binding energy, and\\ngravitational potential, applicable to small, metallic bodies like asteroids\\nand moons. These new approximations could aid future research, including space\\nmining and the scientific characterization of small Solar System bodies.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.space-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T14:45:38Z\"}"}
