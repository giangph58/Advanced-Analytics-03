However, these evaluations may suffer from subjective bias. In\\nthis paper, we explore the acoustic and prosodic features of speech to\\ndifferentiate between positive and neutral UX during interactive sessions. By\\nanalyzing speech features such as root-mean-square (RMS), zero-crossing\\nrate(ZCR), jitter, and shimmer, we identified significant differences between\\nthe positive and neutral user groups. In addition, social speech features such\\nas activity and engagement also show notable variations between these groups.\\nOur findings underscore the potential of speech analysis as an objective and\\nreliable tool for UX measurement, contributing to more robust and\\nbias-resistant evaluation methodologies. This work offers a novel approach to\\nintegrating speech features into UX evaluation and opens avenues for further\\nresearch in HCI.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:07:38Z\"}"}
