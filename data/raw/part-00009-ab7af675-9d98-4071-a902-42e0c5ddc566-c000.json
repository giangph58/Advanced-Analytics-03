{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20616v1\", \"title\": \"Unavoidable subgraphs in digraphs with large out-degrees\", \"summary\": \"We ask the question, which oriented trees $T$ must be contained as subgraphs\\nin every finite directed graph of sufficiently large minimum out-degree. We\\nformulate the following simple condition: all vertices in $T$ of in-degree at\\nleast $2$ must be on the same 'level' in the natural height function of $T$. We\\nprove this condition to be necessary and conjecture it to be sufficient. In\\nsupport of our conjecture, we prove it for a fairly general class of trees.\\n  An essential tool in the latter proof, and a question interesting in its own\\nright, is finding large subdivided in-stars in a directed graph of large\\nminimum out-degree. We conjecture that any digraph and oriented graph of\\nminimum out-degree at least $k\\\\ell$ and $k\\\\ell/2$, respectively, contains the\\n$(k-1)$-subdivision of the in-star with $\\\\ell$ leaves as a subgraph; this would\\nbe tight and generalizes a conjecture of Thomass\\\\'e. We prove this for digraphs\\nand $k=2$ up to a factor of less than $4$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T10:30:33Z\"}"}
