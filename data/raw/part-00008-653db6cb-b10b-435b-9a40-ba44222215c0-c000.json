{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11272v1\", \"title\": \"Attosecond plasma lens\", \"summary\": \"Attosecond pulses provide unique opportunities for studies of time-resolved\\nelectron dynamics. However, focusing these pulses, typically ranging from the\\nvacuum ultraviolet to the soft-X-ray region, remains challenging. Conventional\\nrefractive lenses are not suitable owing to the large dispersion and the strong\\nabsorption, while reflective optics, despite avoiding these issues, still lead\\nto high losses. Here we propose a tunable plasma lens capable of focusing\\nattosecond pulses, and experimentally demonstrate focusing of these pulses at\\nextreme-ultraviolet photon energies around 20 eV and 80 eV. A key advantage is\\nits compatibility with nonlinear frequency conversion processes like\\nhigh-harmonic generation. The different focusing properties of the fundamental\\nlight and the generated harmonic frequencies allow for efficient separation of\\nthese components. Consequently, the transmission of high-harmonic generation\\nbeamlines can be increased to more than 80%, making this approach highly\\nsuitable for photon-demanding applications.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:13:47Z\"}"}
