In particular, Cohen--Macaulay chordal graphs, clique\\ncorona graphs, and Cohen--Macaulay Cameron--Walker graphs are examples of\\nclique-whiskered graphs. We also introduce multi-clique-whiskered graphs as a\\ngeneralization of both clique-whiskered graphs and multi-whisker graphs. We\\nprove that multi-clique-whiskered graphs are vertex decomposable and hence\\nsequentially Cohen--Macaulay. Moreover, we provide formulas for the projective\\ndimension and the Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity of their edge ideals.\\nFinally, we construct minimal free resolutions of the cover ideals of both\\nmulti-clique-whiskered graphs and very well-covered graphs.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AC\", \"categories\": \"math.AC,math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:50:06Z\"}"}
