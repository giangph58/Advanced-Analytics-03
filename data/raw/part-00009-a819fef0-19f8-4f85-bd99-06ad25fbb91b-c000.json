{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20431v1\", \"title\": \"Modeling Dependence in Omics Association Analysis via Structured\\n  Co-Expression Networks to Improve Power and Replicability\", \"summary\": \"Association analysis (e.g., differential expression analysis) and\\nco-expression analysis are two major classes of statistical methods for omics\\ndata. While association analysis identifies individual features linked to\\nhealth conditions, co-expression analysis examines dependencies among features\\nto uncover functional modules and regulatory interactions. However, these\\napproaches are often conducted separately, potentially leading to statistical\\ninference with reduced sensitivity and replicability. To address this, we\\npropose CoReg, a new statistical framework that integrates co-expression\\nnetwork analysis and factor models into the covariance modeling of multivariate\\nregression. By accounting for the dependencies among omics features, CoReg\\nenhances the power and sensitivity of association analysis while maintaining a\\nwell-controlled false discovery rate, thereby improving replicability across\\nomics studies. We developed computationally efficient algorithms to implement\\nCoReg and applied it to extensive simulation studies and real-world omics data\\nanalyses. Results demonstrate that CoReg improves statistical inference\\naccuracy and replicability compared to conventional methods.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T04:59:01Z\"}"}
