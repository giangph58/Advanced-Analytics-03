Following the Planck\\ncollaboration's notation, the inflationary potential with sub-Planckian\\ninflaton field values is given by: $V = \\\\Lambda^4 [1 + \\\\alpha_h \\\\log(\\\\phi /\\nM_{Pl})] - m_{3/2} \\\\Lambda^2 \\\\phi + \\\\Lambda^4 O((\\\\phi / M_{Pl})^4)$. Here,\\n$\\\\Lambda = \\\\sqrt{\\\\kappa} M$ denotes the energy scale of inflation, $M$ is the\\ngauge symmetry breaking scale, $\\\\kappa$ is a dimensionless parameter that sets\\nthe inflaton mass ($\\\\sqrt{2} \\\\kappa M$), and $\\\\alpha_h$ is determined from\\nquantum corrections in terms of $\\\\kappa$ and the underlying gauge group. A soft\\nsupersymmetry-breaking term proportional to the gravitino mass $m_{3/2}$ (~10\\nTeV) and linear in the inflaton field $\\\\phi$ is also present during inflation.\\nThe final term in $V$ represents the leading-order supergravity correction.\\n(Note that the last two terms were not taken into account in the Planck\\nanalysis.) We provide estimates for the parameters $\\\\kappa$ (and $\\\\alpha_h$)\\nthat yield a scalar spectral index $n_s$ in the range 0.96 to 0.98, which is\\nfully consistent with recent P-ACT-LB measurements presented by the Atacama\\nCosmology Telescope, as well as earlier measurements by Planck. We recall that\\nin the absence of the soft SUSY-breaking term proportional to $m_{3/2}$ in $V$,\\nthe spectral index $n_s = 1 - 1/N = 0.98$, where $N = 50$ denotes the number of\\ne-foldings. The tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ in this minimal model is tiny, but\\nit can reach potentially observable values ($r \\\\lesssim 0.01$) in non-minimal\\nmodels.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T03:18:43Z\"}"}
