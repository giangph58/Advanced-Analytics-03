These methods generally assume that\\nthe genetic architecture of complex traits can be parameterized in terms of an\\nadditive model, where the effects of loci are independent, plus (in some cases)\\npairwise epistatic interactions between loci. However, these models struggle to\\nanalyze more complex patterns of epistasis or subtle gene-environment\\ninteractions. Recent advances in machine learning, particularly attention-based\\nmodels, offer a promising alternative. Initially developed for natural language\\nprocessing, attention-based models excel at capturing context-dependent\\ninteractions and have shown exceptional performance in predicting protein\\nstructure and function. Here, we apply attention-based models to quantitative\\ngenetics. We analyze the performance of this attention-based approach in\\npredicting phenotype from genotype using simulated data across a range of\\nmodels with increasing epistatic complexity, and using experimental data from a\\nrecent quantitative trait locus mapping study in budding yeast. We find that\\nour model demonstrates superior out-of-sample predictions in epistatic regimes\\ncompared to standard methods. We also explore a more general multi-environment\\nattention-based model to jointly analyze genotype-phenotype maps across\\nmultiple environments and show that such architectures can be used for\\n\\\"transfer learning\\\" - predicting phenotypes in novel environments with limited\\ntraining data.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.GN\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.GN,cs.LG,q-bio.PE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:32:17Z\"}"}
