{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15133v1\", \"title\": \"EasyEdit2: An Easy-to-use Steering Framework for Editing Large Language\\n  Models\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we introduce EasyEdit2, a framework designed to enable\\nplug-and-play adjustability for controlling Large Language Model (LLM)\\nbehaviors. EasyEdit2 supports a wide range of test-time interventions,\\nincluding safety, sentiment, personality, reasoning patterns, factuality, and\\nlanguage features. Unlike its predecessor, EasyEdit2 features a new\\narchitecture specifically designed for seamless model steering. It comprises\\nkey modules such as the steering vector generator and the steering vector\\napplier, which enable automatic generation and application of steering vectors\\nto influence the model's behavior without modifying its parameters. One of the\\nmain advantages of EasyEdit2 is its ease of use-users do not need extensive\\ntechnical knowledge. With just a single example, they can effectively guide and\\nadjust the model's responses, making precise control both accessible and\\nefficient. Empirically, we report model steering performance across different\\nLLMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of these techniques. We have released the\\nsource code on GitHub at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit along with a\\ndemonstration notebook. In addition, we provide a demo video at\\nhttps://zjunlp.github.io/project/EasyEdit2/video for a quick introduction.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI,cs.CV,cs.HC,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T14:33:55Z\"}"}
