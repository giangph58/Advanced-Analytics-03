The model\\nparameters $\\\\chi, \\\\mu_1,\\\\mu_2, \\\\mu_3, \\\\alpha, \\\\beta, \\\\gamma$, and $\\\\delta$ are\\nall positive. The value $T_{\\\\text{max}}$ indicates the maximum instant of time\\nup to which solutions are defined. Our focus is on examining the global\\nexistence in a bounded domain $\\\\Omega\\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^n, n \\\\geq 3$, under\\nNeumann boundary conditions. We distinguish between two scenarios: $k>1$ and\\n$k=1$. The first case allows to prove boundedness under smaller assumptions\\nrelying only on the model parameters instead of on the initial data, while the\\nsecond case requires an extra condition relating the parameters $\\\\chi, \\\\mu_2$,\\n$n$, and the initial data $\\\\lVert v_0 \\\\rVert_{L^\\\\infty(\\\\Omega)}$. This model\\ncan be seen as an extension of those previously examined in [11] and [4], being\\nthe former a system with only two equations and the latter the same model\\nwithout logistic.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:24:04Z\"}"}
