{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01756v1\", \"title\": \"Renewable Diesel Boom: The Impact of Soybean Crush Plants on Local\\n  Soybean Basis\", \"summary\": \"We investigate the impact of the policy-driven expansion of the diesel and\\nrenewable diesel industry on local soybean prices. Because soybean oil is a key\\nfeedstock for biodiesel and renewable diesel, significant investments have been\\nmade in new soybean crush facilities and the expansion of existing ones. We\\nquantify the effect of both new and existing soybean plants on soybean basis\\nusing panel data and a differences-in-difference approach. The data available\\non new plants does not allow us to identify any statistically significant\\nimpacts. However, existing plants increase the basis by 23.36 to 9.20 cents per\\nbushel, with the effect diminishing with distance. These results suggest the\\nrelevance of biofuel policies in supporting rural economies and have relevant\\npolicy implications.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T14:14:39Z\"}"}
