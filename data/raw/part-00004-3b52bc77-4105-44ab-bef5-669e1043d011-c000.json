{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06709v1\", \"title\": \"Universal profile for cosmic birefringence tomography with radio\\n  galaxies\", \"summary\": \"We propose a new method to tomographically probe cosmic birefringence using\\nradio galaxies. We show that the redshift evolution of the cosmic birefringence\\nangle induced by a slow-rolling pseudoscalar field, which is a candidate for\\ndynamical dark energy, is independent of the detailed model of the pseudoscalor\\nfield. This universal profile evolves predominantly at $z\\\\lesssim10$. In\\ncontrast, if the origin is a dark matter-like pseudscalor field, the resulting\\nbirefringence angle tends to be negligible in the low-redshift regime. This new\\ninsight provides a strong motivation to independently test the cosmic\\nbirefringence using polarized astrophysical sources such as radio galaxies. We\\nfind that a sample size of $\\\\order{10^5-10^6}$ is required to distinguish the\\nprofiles, which is achievable with ongoing and upcoming radio surveys such as\\nASKAP or SKA.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.HE,gr-qc,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T09:09:58Z\"}"}
