The medium above the surface is supposed to\\nbe filled with a homogeneous compressible inviscid air/fluid of constant mass\\ndensity, while the elastic body is assumed to be isotropic and linear. By\\nintroducing the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operators for acoustic and elastic\\nwaves simultaneously, the model is formulated as an acoustic-elastic\\ninteraction problem in periodic structures. Based on a duality argument, an a\\nposteriori error estimate is derived for the associated truncated finite\\nelement approximation. The a posteriori error estimate consists of the finite\\nelement approximation error and the truncation error of two different DtN\\noperators, where the latter decays exponentially with respect to the truncation\\nparameter. Based on the a posteriori error, an adaptive finite element\\nalgorithm is proposed for solving the acoustic-elastic interaction problem in\\nperiodic structures. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the\\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithm.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T04:01:09Z\"}"}
