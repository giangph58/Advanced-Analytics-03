However,\\npropagation through complex media distorts spatial correlations, posing a\\nchallenge for practical implementations. We introduce a symmetrized genetic\\nalgorithm (sGA) for adaptive wavefront correction of spatially entangled\\nphotons, leveraging the insight that only the even-parity component of\\nwavefront distortions affects two-photon correlations. By enforcing symmetry\\nconstraints, sGA reduces the optimization parameter space by half, leading to\\nfaster convergence and improved enhancement within finite number of generations\\ncompared to standard genetic algorithms (GA). Additionally, we establish the\\ndependence of enhancement on the signal-to-noise ratio of the feedback signal,\\nwhich is controlled by detector integration time. This technique enables\\ncorrection of entanglement degradation, enhancing quantum imaging, secure\\nquantum communication, and quantum sensing in complex environments.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T05:14:45Z\"}"}
