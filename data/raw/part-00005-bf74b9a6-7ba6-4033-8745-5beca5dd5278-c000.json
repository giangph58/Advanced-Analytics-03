In the framework of Galerkin projection, we\\nfirst formulate the optimal $H_2$ MOR as an unconstrained Riemannian\\noptimization problem on the Stiefel manifold. The Riemannian gradient of the\\nspecific cost function is derived with the aid of Gramians of systems, and the\\nDai-Yuan-type Riemannian conjugate gradient method is adopted to generate\\nstructure-preserving reduced models. We also consider the optimal $H_2$ MOR\\nbased on the product manifold, where some coefficient matrices of reduced\\nmodels are determined directly via the iteration of optimization problem,\\ninstead of the Galerkin projection method. In addition, we provide a scheme to\\ncompute low-rank approximate solutions of Sylvester equations based on the\\ntruncated polynomial expansions, which fully exploits the specific structure of\\nSylvester equations in the optimization problems, and enables an efficient\\nexecution of our approach. Finally, two numerical examples are simulated to\\ndemonstrate the efficiency of our methods.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T10:09:28Z\"}"}
