The study is conducted within a framework comprising two\\ninvestment portfolios experiencing dependent losses that follow\\nconvolution-equivalent distributions. The main results are encapsulated in two\\ntheorems: one addressing light-tailed losses with convolution-equivalent\\ndistributions and the other focusing on heavy-tailed losses with regularly\\nvarying distributions. Both results reveal that the asymptotic behavior remains\\nrobust regardless of the strength of dependence. Additionally, numerical\\nsimulations are performed under specific scenarios to validate the theoretical\\nresults.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T03:24:07Z\"}"}
