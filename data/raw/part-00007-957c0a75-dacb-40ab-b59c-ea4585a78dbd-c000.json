{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17760v1\", \"title\": \"WI2easy: warm inflation dynamics made easy\", \"summary\": \"We present WI2easy, a Mathematica package for high-precision analysis of warm\\ninflation (WI) dynamics, enabling efficient computation of both background\\nevolution and curvature perturbations. Designed with a user-friendly interface,\\nthe tool supports a broad spectrum of inflaton potentials--including\\nlarge-field, small-field, and hybrid models--and accommodates arbitrary\\ndissipation coefficients dependent on temperature, field amplitude, or both,\\nencompassing canonical forms prevalent in WI studies. Users can define custom\\nmodels through intuitive commands, generating full dynamical trajectories and\\nperturbation spectra in a streamlined workflow. This facilitates rapid\\nconfrontation of theoretical predictions with observational constraints,\\nempowering systematic exploration of WI parameter spaces. WI2easy bridges the\\ngap between theoretical models and observational cosmology, offering a robust,\\nadaptable framework for next-generation inflationary analyses.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T17:25:09Z\"}"}
