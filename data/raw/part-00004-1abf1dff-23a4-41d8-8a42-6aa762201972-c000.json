In univariate settings, methods such as the\\nsample median and trimmed means balance robustness and efficiency by mitigating\\nthe influence of extreme observations. This paper extends these robust\\ntechniques to the multivariate context through the use of data depth functions,\\nwhich provide a natural means to order and rank multidimensional data. We\\nreview several depth measures and discuss their role in generalizing trimmed\\nmean estimators beyond one dimension.\\n  Our main contributions are twofold: first, we prove the almost sure\\nconsistency of the multivariate trimmed mean estimator under mixing conditions;\\nsecond, we establish a general limit distribution theorem for a broad family of\\ndepth-based estimators, encompassing popular examples such as Tukey's and\\nprojection depth. These theoretical advancements not only enhance the\\nunderstanding of robust location estimation in high-dimensional settings but\\nalso offer practical guidelines for applications in areas such as machine\\nlearning, economic analysis, and financial risk assessment.\\n  A small example with simulated data is performed, varying the depth measure\\nused and the percentage of trimmed data.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T13:36:14Z\"}"}
