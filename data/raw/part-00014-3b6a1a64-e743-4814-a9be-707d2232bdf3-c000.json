{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07407v1\", \"title\": \"Cech - de Rham Chern character on the stack of holomorphic vector\\n  bundles\", \"summary\": \"We provide a formula for the Chern character of a holomorphic vector bundle\\nin the hyper-cohomology of the de Rham complex of holomorphic sheaves on a\\ncomplex manifold. This Chern character can be thought of as a completion of the\\nChern character in Hodge cohomology obtained as the trace of the exponential of\\nthe Atiyah class, which is \\\\v{C}ech closed, to one that is \\\\v{C}ech-Del closed.\\nSuch a completion is a key step toward lifting O'Brian-Toledo-Tong invariants\\nof coherent sheaves from Hodge cohomology to de Rham cohomology. An alternate\\napproach toward the same end goal, instead using simplicial differential forms\\nand Green complexes, can be found in Hosgood's works [Ho1, Ho2]. In the\\nalgebraic setting, and more generally for K\\\\\\\"{a}hler manifolds, where Hodge and\\nde Rham cohomologies agree, such extensions are not necessary, whereas in the\\nnon-K\\\\\\\"{a}hler, or equivariant settings the two theories differ. We provide our\\nformulae as a map of simplicial presheaves, which readily extend the results to\\nthe equivariant setting and beyond. This paper can be viewed as a sequel to\\n[GMTZ1] which covered such a discussion in Hodge cohomology. As an aside, we\\ngive a conceptual understanding of how formulas obtained by Bott and Tu for\\nChern classes using transition functions and those from Chern-Weil theory using\\nconnections, are part of a natural unifying story.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG,math.AT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T03:01:18Z\"}"}
