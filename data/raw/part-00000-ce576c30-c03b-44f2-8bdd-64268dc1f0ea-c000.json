While the\\neffects of doping have been extensively studied to tune electrical properties,\\nits impact on thermal transport has not yet been thoroughly explored,\\nparticularly with respect to experimental investigations into exceptionally\\nstrong non-Rayleigh defect-phonon scattering phenomena. Herein, by combining\\nthe high-quality growth and advanced characterizations of cubic silicon carbide\\nsingle crystals with well controlled boron doping, we experimentally observe\\nanomalous strong defect-phonon scatterings, among the strongest reported in\\ncommon semiconductors, that exceeds the predictions of the classic mass\\ndifference model by tens of times in magnitude. The measured thermal\\nconductivity of doped 3C SiC match excellently with those predicted by first\\nprinciple calculations in which resonant scattering of low frequency phonon is\\nconsidered. Our findings not only shed light on the fundamental understanding\\nof defect-phonon interactions and will also impact applications such as thermal\\nmanagement of electronics.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:39:55Z\"}"}
