This\\nstudy explores the two-dimensional, 18-crown-6-like N8 structure (2D-N8) as a\\npromising electrode material for next-generation rechargeable post-lithium\\nbatteries. We thoroughly investigated the pristine N8 structures, focusing on\\ntheir stability and performance metrics. Our analysis revealed remarkable\\nstructural stability across the board. Additionally, electronic calculations\\nindicated a small band gap of 0.54 eV for the N8 monolayer, suggesting\\nfavorable electronic properties for battery applications. When we evaluated a\\nseries of metal ions as adsorbates, we found that the pristine N8 monolayer\\nachieved an impressive storage capacity of 1675 mAh/g for sodium (Na) and\\nmagnesium (Mg) ions, highlighting its potential for effective ion storage. Our\\nfindings suggest that the engineered 2D-N8 structure offers a unique\\ncombination of stability and electrochemical performance that could\\nsignificantly contribute to developing efficient and durable energy storage\\ntechnologies.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T11:21:27Z\"}"}
