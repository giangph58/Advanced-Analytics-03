For them not all of the 2s+1 spin\\nmagnetic quantum states exist, with two exceptions, and the spin operator\\nceases to be defined properly and consistently. The problem was solved by\\nSchwinger, who introduced non-commutative space coordinates that completely\\neliminate the spin operator and ensure that only helicity operator appears\\nexplicitly. We further investigate the violation of the associativity relation\\nof the momentum translation operator that emerges due to the failure of the\\ncorresponding Jacobi identity. The associativity relation is broken by a phase\\nfactor which satisfies a 3-cocycle relation. The associativity is restored when\\na 3-cocycle is an integer number, and leads to the quantisation of massless\\nparticle's helicity. We discuss the correspondence (duality) between the\\nhelicity and the Dirac quantisation conditions.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T11:23:47Z\"}"}
