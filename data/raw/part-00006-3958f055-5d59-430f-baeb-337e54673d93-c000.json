Compared\\nto conventional approaches, our method offers two to three orders of magnitude\\nspeed-up in complex multimode waveguide designs. Based on this approach, we\\ndemonstrate a silicon multimode waveguide bend with an effective radius of\\n$30\\\\,\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{m}$ under one second, with accuracy validated against\\ncommercial 3D finite-difference time-domain method. We further explore its\\nutility for device optimization by designing a $20\\\\,\\\\mu \\\\mathrm{m}$-radius,\\narbitrary power splitting ratio bends through thousands of optimization\\niterations, completed in just 68 minutes on a standard desktop CPU. This\\nframework enables the rapid design and engineering of large-scale multimode\\nphotonic devices, making computationally intensive simulations more accessible\\nto many photonic circuit designers.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T06:17:19Z\"}"}
