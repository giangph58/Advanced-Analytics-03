{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12120v1\", \"title\": \"Logarithmic Spectral Distribution of a non-Hermitian $\\u03b2$-Ensemble\", \"summary\": \"We introduce a non-Hermitian $\\\\beta$-ensemble and determine its spectral\\ndensity in the limit of large $\\\\beta$ and large matrix size $n$. The ensemble\\nis given by a general tridiagonal complex random matrix of normal and\\nchi-distributed random variables, extending previous work of two of the\\nauthors. The joint distribution of eigenvalues contains a Vandermonde\\ndeterminant to the power $\\\\beta$ and a residual coupling to the eigenvectors. A\\ntool in the computation of the limiting spectral density is a single\\ncharacteristic polynomial for centred tridiagonal Jacobi matrices, for which we\\nexplicitly determine the coefficients in terms of its matrix elements. In the\\nlow temperature limit $\\\\beta\\\\gg1$ our ensemble reduces to such a centred matrix\\nwith vanishing diagonal. A general theorem from free probability based on the\\nvariance of the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial allows us to\\nobtain the spectral density when additionally taking the large-$n$ limit. It is\\nrotationally invariant on a compact disc, given by the logarithm of the radius\\nplus a constant. The same density is obtained when starting form a tridiagonal\\ncomplex symmetric ensemble, which thus plays a special role. Extensive\\nnumerical simulations confirm our analytical results and put this and the\\npreviously studied ensemble in the context of the pseudospectrum.\", \"main_category\": \"math-ph\", \"categories\": \"math-ph,cond-mat.stat-mech,math.MP,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T14:33:46Z\"}"}
