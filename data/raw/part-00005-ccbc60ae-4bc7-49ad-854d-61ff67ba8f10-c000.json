{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10249v1\", \"title\": \"Struggle First, Prompt Later: How Task Complexity Shapes Learning with\\n  GenAI-Assisted Pretesting\", \"summary\": \"This study examines the role of AI-assisted pretesting in enhancing learning\\noutcomes, particularly when integrated with generative AI tools like ChatGPT.\\nPretesting, a learning strategy in which students attempt to answer questions\\nor solve problems before receiving instruction, has been shown to improve\\nretention by activating prior knowledge. The adaptability and interactivity of\\nAI-assisted pretesting introduce new opportunities for optimizing learning in\\ndigital environments. Across three experimental studies, we explored how\\npretesting strategies, task characteristics, and student motivation influence\\nlearning. Findings suggest that AI-assisted pretesting enhances learning\\noutcomes, particularly for tasks requiring higher-order thinking. While\\nadaptive AI-driven pretesting increased engagement, its benefits were most\\npronounced in complex, exploratory tasks rather than straightforward\\ncomputational problems. These results highlight the importance of aligning\\npretesting strategies with task demands, demonstrating that AI can optimize\\nlearning when applied to tasks requiring deeper cognitive engagement. This\\nresearch provides insights into how AI-assisted pretesting can be effectively\\nintegrated with generative AI tools to enhance both cognitive and motivational\\noutcomes in learning environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T14:12:28Z\"}"}
