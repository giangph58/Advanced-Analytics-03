This paper develops a\\nunified framework that integrates systems of cities and regional models to\\naddress this question within a general geographic space. A key feature is the\\nendogenous formation of commuting areas linking a continuum of residential\\nlocations to a finite set of potential business districts. Using tools from\\ncomputational geometry and shape optimization, we derive sufficient conditions\\nfor the existence and uniqueness of spatial equilibria. For plausible parameter\\nvalues, urban location is indeterminate, but, conditional on an urban system,\\ncity sizes are uniquely determined. The framework reconciles seemingly\\nconflicting empirical findings on the role of geography and scale economies in\\nshaping the spatial economy.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.TH\", \"categories\": \"econ.TH,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:24:43Z\"}"}
