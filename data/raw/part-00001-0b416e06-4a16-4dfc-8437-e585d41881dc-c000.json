{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05882v1\", \"title\": \"Turin3D: Evaluating Adaptation Strategies under Label Scarcity in Urban\\n  LiDAR Segmentation with Semi-Supervised Techniques\", \"summary\": \"3D semantic segmentation plays a critical role in urban modelling, enabling\\ndetailed understanding and mapping of city environments. In this paper, we\\nintroduce Turin3D: a new aerial LiDAR dataset for point cloud semantic\\nsegmentation covering an area of around 1.43 km2 in the city centre of Turin\\nwith almost 70M points. We describe the data collection process and compare\\nTurin3D with others previously proposed in the literature. We did not fully\\nannotate the dataset due to the complexity and time-consuming nature of the\\nprocess; however, a manual annotation process was performed on the validation\\nand test sets, to enable a reliable evaluation of the proposed techniques. We\\nfirst benchmark the performances of several point cloud semantic segmentation\\nmodels, trained on the existing datasets, when tested on Turin3D, and then\\nimprove their performances by applying a semi-supervised learning technique\\nleveraging the unlabelled training set. The dataset will be publicly available\\nto support research in outdoor point cloud segmentation, with particular\\nrelevance for self-supervised and semi-supervised learning approaches given the\\nabsence of ground truth annotations for the training set.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T10:17:14Z\"}"}
