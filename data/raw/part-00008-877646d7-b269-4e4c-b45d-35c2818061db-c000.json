Traditional methods often assume\\nuncorrelated noise or impose restrictive parametric forms on cross-channel\\ncorrelations, which could lead to biased estimation in complex instrumental\\nnoise. This paper introduces a spline-based framework with trans-dimensional\\nBayesian inference to reconstruct the full noise covariance matrix, including\\nfrequency-dependent auto- and cross-power spectral densities, without prior\\nassumptions on noise shapes. The developed software $\\\\mathtt{NOISAR}$ can\\nrecover the features of the noise power spectrum curves with a relative error\\n$\\\\leq 10\\\\%$ for both auto- and cross-one.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T14:41:56Z\"}"}
