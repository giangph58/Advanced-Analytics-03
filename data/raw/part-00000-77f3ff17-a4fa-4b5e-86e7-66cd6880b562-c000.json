This article\\nexploits molecular mechanics, coarse-grained nanomechanics and micromechanics,\\nto interpret new experimental results from microscopy, porosimetry and\\nnanoindentation. KASH displays a finer nanogranular structure than NASH (3 vs\\n30 nm particle diameters, 5 vs 50 nm average pore diameters), higher skeletal\\ndensity (2.3 vs 2.02 g/cm$^3$), nanoindentation moduli (9.21 vs 7.5 GPa) and\\nhardness (0.56 vs 0.37 GPa) despite a higher total porosity (0.48-0.53 vs\\n0.38). This suggests a stiffer and stronger solid skeleton for KASH, confirmed\\nthrough predictive molecular dynamics simulations on recent and new models of\\nNASH and KASH. The atomistic simulations inform mechanical interactions for\\nnew, coarse-grained, particle-based models of NASH and KASH. The resulting\\nsimulations predict the nanoindentation result that KASH is stiffer than\\nequally porous NASH and the impact of formation eigenstresses on elastic\\nmoduli.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T10:04:09Z\"}"}
