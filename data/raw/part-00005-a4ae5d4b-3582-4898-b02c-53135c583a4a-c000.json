All these notions have\\nhad profound impact on quantum field theory research in the last decade. I\\nhighlight various applications of these new symmetries in particle physics,\\nfocussing on theories beyond the Standard Model. Areas touched upon include\\naxions, gauge unification, dark matter, neutrino masses, and flavour\\nhierarchies.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:16:39Z\"}"}
