{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12811v1\", \"title\": \"AAA-Gaussians: Anti-Aliased and Artifact-Free 3D Gaussian Rendering\", \"summary\": \"Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized 3D reconstruction,\\nit still faces challenges such as aliasing, projection artifacts, and view\\ninconsistencies, primarily due to the simplification of treating splats as 2D\\nentities. We argue that incorporating full 3D evaluation of Gaussians\\nthroughout the 3DGS pipeline can effectively address these issues while\\npreserving rasterization efficiency. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive 3D\\nsmoothing filter to mitigate aliasing and present a stable view-space bounding\\nmethod that eliminates popping artifacts when Gaussians extend beyond the view\\nfrustum. Furthermore, we promote tile-based culling to 3D with screen-space\\nplanes, accelerating rendering and reducing sorting costs for hierarchical\\nrasterization. Our method achieves state-of-the-art quality on in-distribution\\nevaluation sets and significantly outperforms other approaches for\\nout-of-distribution views. Our qualitative evaluations further demonstrate the\\neffective removal of aliasing, distortions, and popping artifacts, ensuring\\nreal-time, artifact-free rendering.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GR\", \"categories\": \"cs.GR,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T10:16:47Z\"}"}
