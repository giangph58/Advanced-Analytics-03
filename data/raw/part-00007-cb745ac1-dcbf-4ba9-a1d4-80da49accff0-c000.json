It becomes crucial to quantify the critical\\nsecurity boundaries and hosting capability of renewable generation at the\\nsystem operation level. This paper proposes a novel point-hyperplane geometry\\n(PHG) method to accurately obtain the geometric expression of the operational\\nsecurity region of renewable energy generation for power systems. Firstly, the\\ngeometric expression of the operational security region is defined as a\\npolytope of boundary hyperplanes in the form of inequalities satisfying the\\nsystem operation constraints. Then, an orthogonal basis generation method is\\nproposed to solve a single boundary hyperplane of the polytope based on\\nintersecting and orthogonal geometric principles. Next, a point-hyperplane\\niteration algorithm is developed to progressively obtain the overall geometric\\npolytope of the operational security region of renewable energy generation in\\npower systems. Besides, the flexible performance trade-off can be achieved by\\nmodifying the proposed maximum tolerated angle between adjacent hyperplanes.\\nFinally, comprehensive case studies verify the effectiveness and superiority of\\nthe PHG method.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T11:12:55Z\"}"}
