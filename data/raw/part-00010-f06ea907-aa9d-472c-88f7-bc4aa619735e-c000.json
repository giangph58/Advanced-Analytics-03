However, they are still limited by several\\nchallenges such as noise, decoherence, and gate errors. As a result, efficient\\nclassical simulation of quantum circuits is vital not only for validating and\\nbenchmarking quantum hardware but also for gaining deeper insights into the\\nbehavior of quantum algorithms. A promising framework for classical simulation\\nis provided by tensor networks. Recently, the Density-Matrix Renormalization\\nGroup (DMRG) algorithm was developed for simulating quantum circuits using\\nmatrix product states (MPS). Although MPS is efficient for representing quantum\\nstates with one-dimensional correlation structures, the fixed linear geometry\\nrestricts the expressive power of the MPS. In this work, we extend the DMRG\\nalgorithm for simulating quantum circuits to tree tensor networks (TTNs). To\\nbenchmark the method, we simulate random and QAOA circuits with various\\ntwo-qubit gate connectivities. For the random circuits, we devise tree-like\\ngate layouts that are suitable for TTN and show that TTN requires less memory\\nthan MPS for the simulations. For the QAOA circuits, a TTN construction that\\nexploits graph structure significantly improves the simulation fidelities. Our\\nfindings show that TTNs provide a promising framework for simulating quantum\\ncircuits, particularly when gate connectivities exhibit clustering or a\\nhierarchical structure.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T13:48:03Z\"}"}
