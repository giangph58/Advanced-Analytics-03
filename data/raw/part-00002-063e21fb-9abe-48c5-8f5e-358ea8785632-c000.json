However, conventional resonant schemes\\nare highly sensitive to laser power fluctuations and pose additional\\nexperimental challenges for emitters with small biexciton binding energies.\\nHere, we demonstrate how biexciton preparation schemes with significantly\\nimproved robustness and reduced laser filtering requirements can be identified\\nusing a novel design principle beyond resonant and adiabatic driving: ultrafast\\nall-optical Floquet engineering. This is achieved by employing two strongly and\\nsymmetrically detuned dichromatic pulses, whose superposition generates a\\nstroboscopic Hamiltonian that enables direct coupling between ground and\\nbiexciton states. Moreover, a pulse delay serves as a tuning knob, introducing\\nan effective magnetic field that concentrates the Bloch sphere trajectory at\\nthe biexciton state for a wide range of parameters, making biexciton\\npreparation particularly robust. Experimentally, we achieve a biexciton\\noccupation exceeding 96% and preserve photon-pair entanglement with a fidelity\\nof 93.4%. Our scheme highlights the great impact of Floquet-engineered\\nmulticolour excitation protocols for on-demand quantum light sources.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T16:45:33Z\"}"}
