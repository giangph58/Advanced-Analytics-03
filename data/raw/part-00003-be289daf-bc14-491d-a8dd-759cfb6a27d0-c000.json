{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21414v1\", \"title\": \"Adapting In-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation to New Domains without\\n  Retraining\", \"summary\": \"Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) aims to segment objects of novel\\nclasses in new domains, which is often challenging due to the diverse\\ncharacteristics of target domains and the limited availability of support data.\\nMost CD-FSS methods redesign and retrain in-domain FSS models using various\\ndomain-generalization techniques, which are effective but costly to train. To\\naddress these issues, we propose adapting informative model structures of the\\nwell-trained FSS model for target domains by learning domain characteristics\\nfrom few-shot labeled support samples during inference, thereby eliminating the\\nneed for retraining. Specifically, we first adaptively identify domain-specific\\nmodel structures by measuring parameter importance using a novel structure\\nFisher score in a data-dependent manner. Then, we progressively train the\\nselected informative model structures with hierarchically constructed training\\nsamples, progressing from fewer to more support shots. The resulting\\nInformative Structure Adaptation (ISA) method effectively addresses domain\\nshifts and equips existing well-trained in-domain FSS models with flexible\\nadaptation capabilities for new domains, eliminating the need to redesign or\\nretrain CD-FSS models on base data. Extensive experiments validate the\\neffectiveness of our method, demonstrating superior performance across multiple\\nCD-FSS benchmarks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T08:16:33Z\"}"}
