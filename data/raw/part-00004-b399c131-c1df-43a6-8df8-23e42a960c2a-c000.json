{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05905v1\", \"title\": \"Rethinking Review Citations: Impact on Scientific Integrity\", \"summary\": \"The proliferation of surveys and review articles in academic journals has\\nimpacted citation metrics like impact factor and h-index, skewing evaluations\\nof journal and researcher quality. This work investigates the implications of\\nthis trend, focusing on the field of Computer Science, where a notable increase\\nin review publications has led to inflated citation counts and rankings. While\\nreviews serve as valuable literature overviews, they should not overshadow the\\nprimary goal of research -to advance scientific knowledge through original\\ncontributions. We advocate for prioritizing citations of primary research in\\njournal articles to uphold citation integrity and ensure fair recognition of\\nsubstantive contributions. This approach preserves the reliability of\\ncitation-based metrics and supports genuine scientific advancement.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DL\", \"categories\": \"cs.DL,cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T11:02:31Z\"}"}
