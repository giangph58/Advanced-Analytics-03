Calculating their\\nmass spectra could provide crucial guidance for determining their spectroscopic\\npositions. Additionally, by analyzing their decay properties, we could predict\\nthe important decay channels, which are essential for experimental searches and\\nquantum number assignments. Our calculations aim to support ongoing\\nexperimental and theoretical efforts in singly bottom baryon spectroscopy.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T12:49:58Z\"}"}
