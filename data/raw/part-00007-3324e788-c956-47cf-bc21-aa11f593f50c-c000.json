{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07757v1\", \"title\": \"Search-contempt: a hybrid MCTS algorithm for training AlphaZero-like\\n  engines with better computational efficiency\", \"summary\": \"AlphaZero in 2017 was able to master chess and other games without human\\nknowledge by playing millions of games against itself (self-play), with a\\ncomputation budget running in the tens of millions of dollars. It used a\\nvariant of the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, known as PUCT. This\\npaper introduces search-contempt, a novel hybrid variant of the MCTS algorithm\\nthat fundamentally alters the distribution of positions generated in self-play,\\npreferring more challenging positions. In addition, search-contempt has been\\nshown to give a big boost in strength for engines in Odds Chess (where one side\\nreceives an unfavorable position from the start). More significantly, it opens\\nup the possibility of training a self-play based engine, in a much more\\ncomputationally efficient manner with the number of training games running into\\nhundreds of thousands, costing tens of thousands of dollars (instead of tens of\\nmillions of training games costing millions of dollars required by AlphaZero).\\nThis means that it may finally be possible to train such a program from zero on\\na standard consumer GPU even with a very limited compute, cost, or time budget.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T13:56:31Z\"}"}
