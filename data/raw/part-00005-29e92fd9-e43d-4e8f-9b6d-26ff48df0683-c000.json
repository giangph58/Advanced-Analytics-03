{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16735v1\", \"title\": \"An Expressive Coalgebraic Modal Logic for Cellular Automata\", \"summary\": \"Cellular automata provide models of parallel computation based on cells,\\nwhose connectivity is given by an action of a monoid on the cells. At each step\\nin the computation, every cell is decorated with a state that evolves in\\ndiscrete steps according to a local update rule, which determines the next\\nstate of a cell based on its neighbour's states. In this paper, we consider a\\ncoalgebraic view on cellular automata, which does not require typical\\nrestrictions, such as uniform neighbourhood connectivity and uniform local\\nrules. Using the coalgebraic view, we devise a behavioural equivalence for\\ncellular automata and a modal logic to reason about their behaviour. We then\\nprove a Hennessy-Milner style theorem, which states that pairs of cells satisfy\\nthe same modal formulas exactly if they are identified under cellular\\nbehavioural equivalence.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LO\", \"categories\": \"cs.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T14:05:29Z\"}"}
