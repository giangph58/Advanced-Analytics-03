{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19877v1\", \"title\": \"Semi-abelian by Design: Johnstone Algebras Unifying Implication and\\n  Division\", \"summary\": \"Johnstone demonstrated that Heyting semilattices form a semi-abelian category\\nvia a specific triple of terms. Inspired by this work, we introduce\\n\\\\emph{Johnstone algebras} or J-algebras. The algebraic $(*,\\\\to,e)$-theory $J$\\nof arities $(2,2,0)$ consists of three axioms carefully chosen to ensure\\nprotomodularity in alignment with Johnstone's terms. Johnstone algebras\\ngeneralize well-known structures such as groups (division) and Heyting\\nsemilattices (implication) providing a unified framework within the\\nwell-behaved setting of semi-abelian categories.\\n  We present two primary contributions. First, we identify the M-axiom, \\\\[\\n(t(x,y)\\\\to x)\\\\to (t(x,y)\\\\to z) \\\\approx x\\\\to z, \\\\text{ where }t(x,y) = (x\\\\to\\ny)\\\\to y. \\\\] The M-axiom is satisfied by residuated Johnstone algebras, and it\\ncan be considered a weakening of the H-axiom to comparable elements. We show\\nthat $t(x,y)$ defines a \\\\emph{relative closure term} in MBC-algebras, and it\\nimplies that MBC-algebras form a variety of algebras, thereby generalizing the\\ncorresponding theorem related to HBCK-algebras. Second, we prove several no-go\\nresults, demonstrating that balanced theories or theories admitting\\nnon-discrete monotone or inflationary algebras cannot possess Malcev terms.\\n  Together, these results establish Johnstone algebras as significant\\nstructures that achieve desirable categorical properties by carefully\\nintegrating both logical and symmetric features, while closely avoiding the\\nconstraints imposed by our no-go results.\", \"main_category\": \"math.LO\", \"categories\": \"math.LO,math.CT,math.RA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:06:42Z\"}"}
