While\\nthe standard toolkit for multivariate time series analysis has many advantages,\\nit can be difficult to capture nonlinear dynamics using linear vector\\nautoregressive models. This difficulty has motivated the development of methods\\nfor variable selection, causal discovery, and graphical modeling for nonlinear\\ntime series, which routinely employ nonparametric tests for conditional\\nindependence. In this paper, we introduce the first framework for conditional\\nindependence testing that works with a single realization of a nonstationary\\nnonlinear process. The key technical ingredients are time-varying nonlinear\\nregression, time-varying covariance estimation, and a distribution-uniform\\nstrong Gaussian approximation.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,math.ST,stat.ML,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T13:51:38Z\"}"}
