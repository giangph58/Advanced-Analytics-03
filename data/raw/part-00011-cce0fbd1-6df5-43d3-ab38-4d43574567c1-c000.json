{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01691v1\", \"title\": \"Reconstruction of coefficients in the double phase problem\", \"summary\": \"The main purpose of this article is to reconstruct the nonnegative\\ncoefficient $a$ in the double phase problem $\\\\mathrm{div}\\\\,(|\\\\nabla\\nu|^{p-2}\\\\nabla u+a|\\\\nabla u|^{q-2}\\\\nabla u)=0$ in a domain $\\\\Omega$, $u=f$ on\\n$\\\\partial\\\\Omega$, from the Dirichlet to Neumann (DN) map $\\\\Lambda_a$. We show\\nthat this can be achieved, when the coefficient $a$ has H\\\\\\\"older continuous\\nfirst order derivatives and the exponents satisfy $1<p\\\\neq q<\\\\infty$. Our\\nreconstruction method relies on a careful analysis of the asymptotic behavior\\nof the solution $u$ to the double phase problem with small or large Dirichlet\\ndatum $f$ (depending on the ordering of $p$ and $q$) as well as the related DN\\nmap $\\\\Lambda_a$. As is common for inverse boundary value problems, we need a\\nsufficiently rich family of special solutions to a related partial differential\\nequation, which is independent of the coefficient one aims to reconstruct (in\\nour case to the $p$-Laplace equation). We construct such families of solutions\\nby a suitable linearization technique.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:44:48Z\"}"}
