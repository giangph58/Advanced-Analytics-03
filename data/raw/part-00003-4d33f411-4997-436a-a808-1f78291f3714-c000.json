Similar jets from stellar-mass black holes offer a\\nchance to study the same phenomena on accessible observation time scales.\\nHowever, such comparative studies across black hole masses and time scales\\nremain hampered by the long-standing perception that stellar-mass black hole\\njets are in a less relativistic regime. We used radio interferometry\\nobservations to monitor the Galactic black hole X-ray binary 4U 1543-47 and\\ndiscovered two distinct, relativistic ejections launched during a single\\noutburst. Our measurements reveal a likely Lorentz factor of $\\\\sim$ 8 and a\\nminimum of 4.6 at launch with 95% confidence, demonstrating that stellar-mass\\nblack holes in X-ray binaries can launch jets as relativistic as those seen in\\nactive galactic nuclei.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T10:23:56Z\"}"}
