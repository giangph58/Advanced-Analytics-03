Herein, we propose an ultra-thin\\nacrylate polymer (diethylene glycol dimethacrylate, DGDMA) into perovskite\\nfilms to investigate the influence of polymerized networks on stability. The\\nmonomer molecules containing acrylate and carbonyl groups were selected, and\\nthe effects of the polymerized were quantified with different concentration.\\nThe experimental results show that, when the concentration of DGDMA is 1 mg/ml,\\nthe PCE increases from 18.06% to 21.82%, which is optimum. The monomer\\nmolecules with carbonyl groups polymerize, they can chelate with uncoordinated\\nPb2+ in perovskite films to improve the film quality, reduce the surface defect\\ndensity to decrease non-radiative recombination, and also significantly enhance\\nthe humidity stability of PSCs.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T15:23:51Z\"}"}
