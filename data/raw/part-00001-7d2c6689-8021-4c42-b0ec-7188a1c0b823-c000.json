{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17505v1\", \"title\": \"Auerbach bases, projection constants, and the joint spectral radius of\\n  principal submatrices\", \"summary\": \"It is shown that compact sets of complex matrices can always be brought, via\\nsimilarity transformation, into a form where all matrix entries are bounded in\\nabsolute value by the joint spectral radius (JSR). The key tool for this is\\nthat every extremal norm of a matrix set admits an Auerbach basis; any such\\nbasis gives rise to a desired coordinate system. An immediate implication is\\nthat all diagonal entries - equivalently, all one-dimensional principal\\nsubmatrices - are uniformly bounded above by the JSR. It is shown that the\\ncorresponding bounding property does not hold for higher dimensional principal\\nsubmatrices. More precisely, we construct finite matrix sets for which, across\\nthe entire similarity orbit, the JSRs of all higher-dimensional principal\\nsubmatrices exceed that of the original set. This shows that the bounding\\nresult does not extend to submatrices of dimension greater than one. The\\nconstructions rely on tools from the geometry of finite-dimensional Banach\\nspaces, with projection constants of norms playing a key role. Additional\\nbounds of the JSR of principal submatrices are obtained using John's\\nellipsoidal approximation and known estimates for projection constants.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS,math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T12:48:53Z\"}"}
