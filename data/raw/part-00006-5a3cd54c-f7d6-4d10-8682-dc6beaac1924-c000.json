{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11411v1\", \"title\": \"Breaking the TDD Flow for Over-the-Air Phase Synchronization in\\n  Distributed Antenna Systems\", \"summary\": \"Phase synchronization between distributed antenna arrays requires\\nmeasurements that break the standard time-division duplex (TDD) operation. We\\npresent a feasibility study on implementing such synchronization and analyze\\nits impact on the quality of service. Considering two antenna arrays with\\nindependent local oscillators (LOs), we propose a modified TDD flow to\\naccommodate the transmission of phase synchronization signals, formulate the\\nphase estimation and compensation problem, and derive the achievable downlink\\nspectral efficiency (SE). Numerical results show that frequent re-estimation of\\nthe interarray phase disparity is essential for maximizing SE in systems with\\nlow-quality LOs. Furthermore, applying a Kalman filter for phase tracking\\nsubstantially improves the SE, especially if phase estimation errors are large\\ncompared to LOs phase drifts.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,eess.SP,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T17:26:42Z\"}"}
