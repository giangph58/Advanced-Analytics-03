With an ever\\nincreasing quantity of raw genome sequences, gene finding is an important\\navenue towards understanding the genetic information of (novel) organisms, as\\nwell as learning shared patterns across evolutionarily diverse species. The\\ncurrent state of the art are graphical models usually trained per organism and\\nrequiring manually curated datasets. However, these models lack the flexibility\\nto incorporate deep learning representation learning techniques that have in\\nrecent years been transformative in the analysis of pro tein sequences, and\\nwhich could potentially help gene finders exploit the growing number of the\\nsequenced genomes to expand performance across multiple organisms. Here, we\\npropose a novel approach, combining learned embeddings of raw genetic sequences\\nwith exact decoding using a latent conditional random field. We show that the\\nmodel achieves performance matching the current state of the art, while\\nincreasing training robustness, and removing the need for manually fitted\\nlength distributions. As language models for DNA improve, this paves the way\\nfor more performant cross-organism gene-finders.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.GN\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.GN\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T09:53:15Z\"}"}
