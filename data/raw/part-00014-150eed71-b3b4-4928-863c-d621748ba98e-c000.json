{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12967v1\", \"title\": \"Krysalis Hand: A Lightweight, High-Payload, 18-DoF Anthropomorphic\\n  End-Effector for Robotic Learning and Dexterous Manipulation\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents the Krysalis Hand, a five-finger robotic end-effector\\nthat combines a lightweight design, high payload capacity, and a high number of\\ndegrees of freedom (DoF) to enable dexterous manipulation in both industrial\\nand research settings. This design integrates the actuators within the hand\\nwhile maintaining an anthropomorphic form. Each finger joint features a\\nself-locking mechanism that allows the hand to sustain large external forces\\nwithout active motor engagement. This approach shifts the payload limitation\\nfrom the motor strength to the mechanical strength of the hand, allowing the\\nuse of smaller, more cost-effective motors. With 18 DoF and weighing only 790\\ngrams, the Krysalis Hand delivers an active squeezing force of 10 N per finger\\nand supports a passive payload capacity exceeding 10 lbs. These characteristics\\nmake Krysalis Hand one of the lightest, strongest, and most dexterous robotic\\nend-effectors of its kind. Experimental evaluations validate its ability to\\nperform intricate manipulation tasks and handle heavy payloads, underscoring\\nits potential for industrial applications as well as academic research. All\\ncode related to the Krysalis Hand, including control and teleoperation, is\\navailable on the project GitHub repository:\\nhttps://github.com/Soltanilara/Krysalis_Hand\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T14:19:26Z\"}"}
