Specifically, leveraging statistical theory, we develop\\nan asymptotically unbiased and $\\\\sqrt {n}$-consistent PnP estimator that\\naccounts for varying 3D triangulation uncertainties, ensuring that the relative\\npose estimate converges to the ground truth as the number of features\\nincreases. Next, on the stereo VO pipeline side, we propose a framework that\\ncontinuously triangulates contemporary features for tracking new frames,\\neffectively decoupling temporal dependencies between pose and 3D point errors.\\nWe integrate the Bias-Eli-W PnP estimator into the proposed stereo VO pipeline,\\ncreating a synergistic effect that enhances the suppression of pose estimation\\nerrors. We validate the performance of our method on the KITTI and Oxford\\nRobotCar datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method: 1)\\nachieves significant improvements in both relative pose error and absolute\\ntrajectory error in large-scale environments; 2) provides reliable localization\\nunder erratic and unpredictable robot motions. The successful implementation of\\nthe Bias-Eli-W PnP in stereo VO indicates the importance of information\\nscreening in robotic estimation tasks with high-uncertainty measurements,\\nshedding light on diverse applications where PnP is a key ingredient.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T10:03:47Z\"}"}
