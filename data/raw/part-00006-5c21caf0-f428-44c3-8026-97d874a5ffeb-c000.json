Here, we propose\\nand analyze a hybrid quantum system consisting of a magnetic skyrmion, an NV\\ncenter, and a superconducting qubit, where the solid-state qubits are both\\npositioned in proximity to the skyrmion structure in a thin magnetic disk. We\\nshow that it is experimentally feasible to achieve strong magnetic (coherent or\\ndissipative) coupling between the NV center and the superconducting qubit by\\nusing the \\\\textit{quantized gyration mode of the skyrmion} as an intermediary.\\nThis allows coherent information transfer and nonreciprocal responses between\\nthe NV center and the superconducting qubit at the single quantum level with\\nhigh controllability. The proposed platform provides a scalable pathway for\\nimplementing quantum protocols that synergistically exploit the complementary\\nadvantages of spin-based quantum memories, microwave-frequency superconducting\\ncircuits, and topologically protected magnetic excitations.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T03:24:42Z\"}"}
