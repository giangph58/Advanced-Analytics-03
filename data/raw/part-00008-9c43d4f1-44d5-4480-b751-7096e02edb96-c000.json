The\\nestimation accuracy and variation can differ significantly across parameters.\\nFor instance, inductance estimations are generally more accurate and stable\\nthan inductor resistance in a buck converter. However, these performance\\ndifferences remain to be analyzed with a more systematic approach otherwise the\\ncondition monitoring results can be unreliable. Therefore, this paper analyzes\\nthe training loss landscape against multiple parameters of a buck converter to\\nprovide a systematic explanation of different performances. If the training\\nloss is high and smooth, the estimated circuit parameter typically is accurate\\nand has low variation. Furthermore, a novel physics-informed neural network\\n(PINN) is proposed, offering faster convergence and lower computation\\nrequirements compared to an existing PINN method. The proposed method is\\nvalidated through simulations, where the loss landscape identifies the\\nunreliable parameter estimations, and the PINN can estimate the remaining\\nparameters.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T08:15:09Z\"}"}
