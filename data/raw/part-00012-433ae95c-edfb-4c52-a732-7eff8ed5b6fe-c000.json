QAOA solves optimization problems using a\\nparameterized circuit with $p$ layers, with higher $p$ leading to better\\nsolutions. Existing methods require optimizing $2p$ independent parameters\\nwhich is challenging for large $p$. In this work, we present an iterative\\ninterpolation method that exploits the smoothness of optimal parameter\\nschedules by expressing them in a basis of orthogonal functions, generalizing\\nZhou et al. By optimizing a small number of basis coefficients and iteratively\\nincreasing both circuit depth and the number of coefficients until convergence,\\nour approach enables construction of high-quality schedules for large $p$. We\\ndemonstrate our method achieves better performance with fewer optimization\\nsteps than current approaches on three problems: the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick\\n(SK) model, portfolio optimization, and Low Autocorrelation Binary Sequences\\n(LABS). For the largest LABS instance, we achieve near-optimal merit factors\\nwith schedules exceeding 1000 layers, an order of magnitude beyond previous\\nmethods. As an application of our technique, we observe a mild growth of QAOA\\ndepth sufficient to solve SK model exactly, a result of independent interest.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.ET\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:53:21Z\"}"}
