In this Letter, we report a new source\\nof the stochastic gravitational wave background induced by the collision of\\nsound shells in the early Universe. The peak frequency and amplitude in the GW\\nspectrum depend on the Hubble horizon and the abundance of sound shells.\\nAbundant density perturbations would lead to GW backgrounds potentially\\ndetectable for future pulsar timing arrays and ground-based/space-borne\\ndetectors. For those perturbations that collapse into PBHs, future null\\ndetection of the corresponding high-frequency GW background could put new\\nobservational constraints on those PBHs that have already evaporated.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.CO,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:15:15Z\"}"}
