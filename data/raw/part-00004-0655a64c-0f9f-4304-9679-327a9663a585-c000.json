{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04426v1\", \"title\": \"Polynomial deformations of $sl(2)$ and unified algebraic framework for\\n  solutions of a class of spin models\", \"summary\": \"We introduce novel polynomial deformations of the Lie algebra $sl(2)$. We\\nconstruct their finite-dimensional irreducible representations and the\\ncorresponding differential operator realizations. We apply our results to a\\nclass of spin models with hidden polynomial algebra symmetry and obtain the\\nclosed-form expressions for their energies and wave functions by means of the\\nBethe ansatz method. The general framework enables us to give an unified\\nalgebraic and analytic treatment for three interesting spin models with hidden\\ncubic algebra symmetry: the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model, the molecular\\nasymmetric rigid rotor, and the two-axis countertwisting squeezing model. We\\nprovide analytic and numerical insights into the structures of the roots of the\\nBethe ansatz equations (i.e. the so-called Bethe roots) of these models. We\\ngive descriptions of the roots on the spheres using the inverse stereographic\\nprojection. The changes in nature and pattern of the Bethe roots on the spheres\\nindicate the existence of different phases of the models. We also present the\\nfidelity and derivatives of the ground-state energies (with respect to model\\nparameters) of the models. The results indicate the presence of critical points\\nand phase transitions of the models. In the appendix, we show that, unlike the\\nso-called Bender-Dunne polynomials, the set of polynomials in the energy $E$,\\n$P_\\\\ell(E)$, corresponding to each of the three spin models has two critical\\npolynomials whose zeros give the quasi-exact energy eigenvalues of the model.\\nSuch types of polynomials seem new.\", \"main_category\": \"math-ph\", \"categories\": \"math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T13:58:15Z\"}"}
