{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19767v1\", \"title\": \"Crafting a Personal Journaling Practice: Negotiating Ecosystems of\\n  Materials, Personal Context, and Community in Analog Journaling\", \"summary\": \"Analog journaling has grown in popularity, with journaling on paper\\nencompassing a range of motivations, styles, and practices including planning,\\nhabit-tracking, and reflecting. Journalers develop strong personal preferences\\naround the tools they use, the ideas they capture, and the layout in which they\\nrepresent their ideas and memories. Understanding how analog journaling\\npractices are individually shaped and crafted over time is critical to\\nsupporting the varied benefits associated with journaling, including improved\\nmental health and positive support for identity development. To understand this\\ndevelopment, we qualitatively analyzed publicly-shared journaling content from\\nYouTube and Instagram and interviewed 11 journalers. We report on our\\nidentification of the journaling ecosystem in which journaling practices are\\nshaped by materials, personal context, and communities, sharing how this\\necosystem plays a role in the practices and identities of journalers as they\\ncustomize their journaling routine to best suit their personal goals. Using\\nthese insights, we discuss design opportunities for how future tools can better\\nalign with and reflect the rich affordances and practices of journaling on\\npaper.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T13:07:29Z\"}"}
