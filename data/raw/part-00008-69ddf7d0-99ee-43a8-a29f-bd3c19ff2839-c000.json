Compared to the state-vector approach, the extended stabilizer\\nformalism can solve the same problems with fewer computational resources, as it\\noperates on stabilizers rather than full state vectors. Most existing studies\\non near-Clifford circuits focus on balancing the trade-off between the number\\nof ancilla qubits and simulation accuracy, often overlooking performance\\nconsiderations. Furthermore, in the presence of high-rank stabilizers,\\nperformance is limited by the sequential property of the stabilizer formalism.\\nIn this work, we introduce a parallelized version of the extended stabilizer\\nformalism, enabling efficient execution on multi-core devices such as GPU.\\nExperimental results demonstrate that, in certain scenarios, our Python-based\\nimplementation outperforms state-of-the-art simulators such as Qiskit and\\nPennylane.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:41:28Z\"}"}
