We\\nshow that depending on long-haul link characteristics, such as drop rate,\\ndistance and bandwidth, the widely used Selective Repeat algorithm can be\\ninefficient, warranting alternatives like Erasure Coding. To enable such\\nalternatives on existing hardware, we propose SDR-RDMA, a software-defined\\nreliability stack for RDMA. Its core is a lightweight SDR SDK that extends\\nstandard point-to-point RDMA semantics -- fundamental to AI networking stacks\\n-- with a receive buffer bitmap. SDR bitmap enables partial message completion\\nto let applications implement custom reliability schemes tailored to specific\\ndeployments, while preserving zero-copy RDMA benefits. By offloading the SDR\\nbackend to NVIDIA's Data Path Accelerator (DPA), we achieve line-rate\\nperformance, enabling efficient inter-datacenter communication and advancing\\nreliability innovation for intra-datacenter training.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T16:03:35Z\"}"}
