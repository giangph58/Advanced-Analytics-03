This is\\nmotivated by the result of Huybrechts and the recent proposal of\\nBapat-Deopurkar-Licata on the construction of a compactification of a stability\\nmanifold. We also construct lax stability conditions in the sense of\\nBroomhead-Pauksztello-Ploog-Woolf associated to spherical bundles.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG,math.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T17:02:22Z\"}"}
