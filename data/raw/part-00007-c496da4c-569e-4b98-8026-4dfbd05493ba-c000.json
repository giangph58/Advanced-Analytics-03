Specifically, we consider\\nestimators of the optimal value and the optimal solutions in a sample minimax\\nproblem that approximates the true population problem and study the limiting\\ndistributions of these estimators as the sample size tends to infinity. The\\nmain technical tool we employ in our analysis is the theory of sensitivity\\nanalysis of parameterized mathematical optimization problems. Our results go\\nwell beyond the existing literature and show that these limiting distributions\\nare highly non-Gaussian in general and normal in simple specific cases. These\\nresults open up the way for the development of statistical inference methods in\\nparametric minimax problems.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:10:59Z\"}"}
