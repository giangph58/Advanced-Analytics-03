To address this gap, we developed an interactive platform that served\\nas a data collection tool for exploring public views on AI, including their\\nfears, hopes, and overall sense of hopefulness. We made the platform available\\nto 330 participants representative of the U.S. population in terms of age, sex,\\nethnicity, and political leaning, and compared their views with those of 100 AI\\ninfluencers identified by Time magazine. The public fears AI getting out of\\ncontrol, while influencers emphasize regulation, seemingly to deflect attention\\nfrom their alleged focus on monetizing AI's potential. Interestingly, the views\\nof AI influencers from underrepresented groups such as women and people of\\ncolor often differ from the views of underrepresented groups in the public.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:21:31Z\"}"}
