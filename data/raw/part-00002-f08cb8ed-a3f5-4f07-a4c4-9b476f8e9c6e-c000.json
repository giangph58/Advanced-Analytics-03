{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04104v1\", \"title\": \"Position: We need responsible, application-driven (RAD) AI research\", \"summary\": \"This position paper argues that achieving meaningful scientific and societal\\nadvances with artificial intelligence (AI) requires a responsible,\\napplication-driven approach (RAD) to AI research. As AI is increasingly\\nintegrated into society, AI researchers must engage with the specific contexts\\nwhere AI is being applied. This includes being responsive to ethical and legal\\nconsiderations, technical and societal constraints, and public discourse. We\\npresent the case for RAD-AI to drive research through a three-staged approach:\\n(1) building transdisciplinary teams and people-centred studies; (2) addressing\\ncontext-specific methods, ethical commitments, assumptions, and metrics; and\\n(3) testing and sustaining efficacy through staged testbeds and a community of\\npractice. We present a vision for the future of application-driven AI research\\nto unlock new value through technically feasible methods that are adaptive to\\nthe contextual needs and values of the communities they ultimately serve.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T03:43:52Z\"}"}
