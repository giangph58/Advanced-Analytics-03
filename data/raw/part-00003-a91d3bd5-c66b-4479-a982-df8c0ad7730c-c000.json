Due to the non-zero curvature and non-zero\\ntangential velocity of compressible Euler solution on the boundary, new\\ndifficulties arise in the construction of Knudsen boundary layer. By employing\\nthe geometric correction, and an innovative and refined $L^2-L^\\\\infty$ method,\\nwe establish the existence and space-decay for a truncated Knudsen boundary\\nlayer. Then, by the Hilbert expansion of multi-scales, we successfully justify\\nthe hydrodynamic limit of Boltzmann equation with specular reflection boundary\\ncondition to the compressible Euler equations in the two-dimensional disk.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T07:51:48Z\"}"}
