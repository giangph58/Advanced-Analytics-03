{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19729v1\", \"title\": \"Faster Dynamic $(\\u0394+1)$-Coloring Against Adaptive Adversaries\", \"summary\": \"We consider the problem of maintaining a proper $(\\\\Delta + 1)$-vertex\\ncoloring in a graph on $n$-vertices and maximum degree $\\\\Delta$ undergoing edge\\ninsertions and deletions. We give a randomized algorithm with amortized update\\ntime $\\\\widetilde{O}( n^{2/3} )$ against adaptive adversaries, meaning that\\nupdates may depend on past decisions by the algorithm. This improves on the\\nvery recent $\\\\widetilde{O}( n^{8/9} )$-update-time algorithm by Behnezhad,\\nRajaraman, and Wasim (SODA 2025) and matches a natural barrier for dynamic\\n$(\\\\Delta+1)$-coloring algorithms. The main improvements are in the densest\\nregions of the graph, where we use structural hints from the study of\\ndistributed graph algorithms.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T12:28:45Z\"}"}
