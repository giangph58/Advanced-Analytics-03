In this work, we propose\\nForesightNav, a novel exploration strategy inspired by human imagination and\\nreasoning. Our approach equips robotic agents with the capability to predict\\ncontextual information, such as occupancy and semantic details, for unexplored\\nregions. These predictions enable the robot to efficiently select meaningful\\nlong-term navigation goals, significantly enhancing exploration in unseen\\nenvironments. We validate our imagination-based approach using the Structured3D\\ndataset, demonstrating accurate occupancy prediction and superior performance\\nin anticipating unseen scene geometry. Our experiments show that the\\nimagination module improves exploration efficiency in unseen environments,\\nachieving a 100% completion rate for PointNav and an SPL of 67% for ObjectNav\\non the Structured3D Validation split. These contributions demonstrate the power\\nof imagination-driven reasoning for autonomous systems to enhance generalizable\\nand efficient exploration.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T17:38:38Z\"}"}
