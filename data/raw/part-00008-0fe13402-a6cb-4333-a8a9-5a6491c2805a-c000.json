The feature extractors generate vector\\nrepresentations of the input sound segments, called embeddings, which can be\\ninput to a classifier. While benchmarking of classification scores provides\\ninsights into specific performance statistics, it is limited to species that\\nare included in the models' training data. Furthermore, it makes it impossible\\nto compare models trained on very different taxonomic groups. This paper aims\\nto address this gap by analyzing the embeddings generated by the feature\\nextractors of 15 bioacoustic models spanning a wide range of setups (model\\narchitectures, training data, training paradigms). We evaluated and compared\\ndifferent ways in which models structure embedding spaces through clustering\\nand kNN classification, which allows us to focus our comparison on feature\\nextractors independent of their classifiers. We believe that this approach lets\\nus evaluate the adaptability and generalization potential of models going\\nbeyond the classes they were trained on.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T09:13:18Z\"}"}
