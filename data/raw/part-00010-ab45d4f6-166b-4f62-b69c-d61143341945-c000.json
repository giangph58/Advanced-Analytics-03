This contribution\\nwill outline the scientific case for this detector, its design and potential\\nlocations, and the sensitivity that can be achieved. The ongoing efforts to\\nprove the feasibility of the detector with the FORMOSA demonstrator will be\\ndiscussed. Finally, possible upgrades to the detector through the use of\\nhigh-performance scintillator will be discussed.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex,physics.ins-det\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T14:26:33Z\"}"}
