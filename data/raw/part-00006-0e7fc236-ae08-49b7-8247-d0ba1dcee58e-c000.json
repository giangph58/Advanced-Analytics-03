We present a novel technique based on physically\\ninformed neural networks (PINNs) to solve the eigenvalue problem associated\\nwith normal oscillation modes of neutron stars. The procedure is tested in a\\nsimplified scenario, with an analytical solution, that can be used to test the\\nperformance and the accuracy of the method. We show that it is possible to get\\naccurate results of both the eigenfrequencies and the eigenfunctions with this\\nscheme. The flexibility of the method and its capability of adapting to complex\\nscenarios may serve in the future as a path to include more physics into these\\nsystems.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T15:39:45Z\"}"}
