We show that\\nseparation is undecidable for the two-variable fragment of FO extended with\\ncounting quantifiers and for the graded modal logic with inverse, nominals and\\nuniversal modality. On the other hand, if inverse or nominals are dropped,\\nseparation becomes coNExpTime- or 2ExpTime-complete, depending on whether the\\nuniversal modality is present. In contrast, definability can often be reduced\\nin polynomial time to validity in L. We also consider uniform separation and\\nshow that it often behaves similarly to definability.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LO\", \"categories\": \"cs.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T07:30:57Z\"}"}
