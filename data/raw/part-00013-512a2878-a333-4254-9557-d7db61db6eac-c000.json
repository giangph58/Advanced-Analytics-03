{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21410v1\", \"title\": \"Tolerating Disasters with Hierarchical Consensus\", \"summary\": \"Geo-replication provides disaster recovery after catastrophic accidental\\nfailures or attacks, such as fires, blackouts or denial-of-service attacks to a\\ndata center or region. Naturally distributed data structures, such as\\nBlockchains, when well designed, are immune against such disruptions, but they\\nalso benefit from leveraging locality. In this work, we consolidate the\\nperformance of geo-replicated consensus by leveraging novel insights about\\nhierarchical consensus and a construction methodology that allows creating\\nnovel protocols from existing building blocks. In particular we show that\\ncluster confirmation, paired with subgroup rotation, allows protocols to safely\\noperate through situations where all members of the global consensus group are\\nByzantine. We demonstrate our compositional construction by combining the\\nrecent HotStuff and Damysus protocols into a hierarchical geo-replicated\\nblockchain with global durability guarantees. We present a compositionality\\nproof and demonstrate the correctness of our protocol, including its ability to\\ntolerate cluster crashes. Our protocol -ORION 1 -achieves a 20% higher\\nthroughput than GeoBFT, the latest hierarchical Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT)\\nprotocol.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T08:10:10Z\"}"}
