However, whether\\nFnGD can be observed experimentally in molecular fuids is still obscure with\\nvery little study in real systems. In this letter, we show existence of FnGD in\\nmolecular fluids based on compelling evidence from incoherent quasielastic\\nneutron scattering (IQENS). Using a cage-jump diffsion model, we show that\\nwhile the approach to Fickianity is exponentially fast, the Gaussianity is\\nrestored at a much slower algebraic rate. We propose a non-local diffusion\\n(NLD) model to describe a d-dimensional jump-diffusion in FnGD regime and show\\ntheir universal applicability in such systems. This study establishes that\\ncage-jump diffusion process inevitably lead to FnGD and provides the framework\\nof NLD models to explore such diffusion phenomena in any arbitrary dimensions.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T11:06:20Z\"}"}
