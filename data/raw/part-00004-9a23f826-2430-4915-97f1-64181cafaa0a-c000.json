{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03338v1\", \"title\": \"Safer Prompts: Reducing IP Risk in Visual Generative AI\", \"summary\": \"Visual Generative AI models have demonstrated remarkable capability in\\ngenerating high-quality images from simple inputs like text prompts. However,\\nbecause these models are trained on images from diverse sources, they risk\\nmemorizing and reproducing specific content, raising concerns about\\nintellectual property (IP) infringement. Recent advances in prompt engineering\\noffer a cost-effective way to enhance generative AI performance. In this paper,\\nwe evaluate the effectiveness of prompt engineering techniques in mitigating IP\\ninfringement risks in image generation. Our findings show that Chain of Thought\\nPrompting and Task Instruction Prompting significantly reduce the similarity\\nbetween generated images and the training data of diffusion models, thereby\\nlowering the risk of IP infringement.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.AI,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T09:10:12Z\"}"}
