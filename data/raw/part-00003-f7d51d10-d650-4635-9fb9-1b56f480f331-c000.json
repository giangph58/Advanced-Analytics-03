For large $p$, the spectrum of $H_p$ asymptotically\\ncoincides with the union of all local Landau levels of the operator at the\\npoints of $X$. Moreover, if the union of the local Landau levels over the\\ncomplement of a compact subset of $X$ has a gap, then the spectrum of $H_{p}$\\nin the gap is discrete. The main result of the paper is the trace asymptotics\\nformula associated with these eigenvalues. As a consequence, we get a Weyl type\\nasymptotic formula for the eigenvalue counting function.\", \"main_category\": \"math.SP\", \"categories\": \"math.SP,math-ph,math.DG,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T13:26:05Z\"}"}
