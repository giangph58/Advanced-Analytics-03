{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15092v1\", \"title\": \"Extending structures for pre-Poisson algebras and pre-Poisson bialgebras\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we explore the extending structures problem by the unified\\nproduct for pre-Poisson algebras. In particular, the crossed product and the\\nfactorization problem are investigated. Furthermore, a special case of\\nextending structures is studied under the case of pre-Poisson algebras, which\\nleads to the discussion of bicrossed products and matched pairs of pre-Poisson\\nalgebras. We develop a bialgebra theory for pre-Poisson algebras and establish\\nthe equivalence between matched pairs and pre-Poisson bialgebras. We study\\ncoboundary pre-Poisson bialgebras, which lead to the introduction of the\\npre-Poisson Yang-Baxter equation (PPYBE). A symmetric solution of the PPYBE\\nnaturally gives a coboundary pre-Poisson bialgebra.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RA\", \"categories\": \"math.RA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T13:24:32Z\"}"}
