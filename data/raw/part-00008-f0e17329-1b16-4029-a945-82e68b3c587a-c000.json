Functional groups, lipids, and other complex molecules can be\\nanalyzed by optical absorption measurements due to their vibrational modes in\\nthe MIR spectral region. Over the past few decades, this field has faced\\nchallenges due to difficulties in generating MIR light and the limited maturity\\nof detection systems in this spectral range. Quantum imaging with undetected\\nlight (QIUL) provides a spectrally tuneable photon-pair source, in which the\\nsample can be illuminated with MIR light while visible (VIS) light is employed\\nfor detection and image reconstruction, overcoming the detection limitations\\nand benefiting from the rich chemical information of the MIR spectral region.\\nAll previous QIUL implementations are based on spatial correlations, which are\\nnever perfect and thus hindered the imaging performance. In this work, we\\nimplement a raster-scanning QIUL method that is independent of the strength of\\nthe spatial correlations and achieves a spatial resolution beyond the\\nlimitations of these correlations.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T15:06:43Z\"}"}
