{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17261v1\", \"title\": \"Symbolic Representation for Any-to-Any Generative Tasks\", \"summary\": \"We propose a symbolic generative task description language and a\\ncorresponding inference engine capable of representing arbitrary multimodal\\ntasks as structured symbolic flows. Unlike conventional generative models that\\nrely on large-scale training and implicit neural representations to learn\\ncross-modal mappings, often at high computational cost and with limited\\nflexibility, our framework introduces an explicit symbolic representation\\ncomprising three core primitives: functions, parameters, and topological logic.\\nLeveraging a pre-trained language model, our inference engine maps natural\\nlanguage instructions directly to symbolic workflows in a training-free manner.\\nOur framework successfully performs over 12 diverse multimodal generative\\ntasks, demonstrating strong performance and flexibility without the need for\\ntask-specific tuning. Experiments show that our method not only matches or\\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art unified models in content quality, but\\nalso offers greater efficiency, editability, and interruptibility. We believe\\nthat symbolic task representations provide a cost-effective and extensible\\nfoundation for advancing the capabilities of generative AI.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T05:35:47Z\"}"}
