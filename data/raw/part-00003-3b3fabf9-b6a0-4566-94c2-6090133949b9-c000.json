By applying the STRIP pipeline to\\nboth simulated and real observational data of the Mini-SiTian survey, it\\nsuccessfully identified various types of variable sources, including stellar\\nflares, supernovae, variable stars, and asteroids, while meeting requirements\\nof reduction speed within 5 minutes. For the real observational dataset, the\\npipeline detected 1 flare event, 127 variable stars, and 14 asteroids from\\nthree monitored sky regions. Additionally, two datasets were generated: one, a\\nreal-bogus training dataset comprising 218,818 training samples, and the other,\\na variable star light curve dataset with 421 instances. These datasets will be\\nused to train machine learning algorithms, which are planned for future\\nintegration into STRIP.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:25:59Z\"}"}
