However, the search of material platforms with a large response\\nremains a problem. Here, we suggest that topological Weyl semimetals can host\\nenhanced intrinsic nonlinear planar Hall effect. From a model study, we show\\nthat the enhancement is mainly from the orbital contribution, and the response\\ncoefficient exhibits a characteristic resonance-like lineshape around the\\nWeyl-point energy. Using first-principles calculations, we confirm these\\nfeatures for the concrete material CuTlSe$_{2}$. Previous studies have reported\\ntwo different topological states of CuTlSe$_{2}$. We find this difference\\noriginates from two slightly different structures with different lattice\\nparameters. We show that the nonlinear planar Hall response is much stronger in\\nthe Weyl semimetal state than in the topological insulator state, and the large\\nresponse is indeed dominated by orbital contribution amplified by Weyl points.\\nOur work reveals a close connection between nonlinear orbital responses and\\ntopological band features, and suggests CuTlSe$_{2}$ as a suitable platform for\\nrealizing enhanced nonlinear planar Hall effect.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T10:30:58Z\"}"}
