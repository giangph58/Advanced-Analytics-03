The main aim is to\\ncheck if the increase in band gap due to substitution of I$^-$ ions with Br$^-$\\nions can be overcome by introducing the inorganic SbH$_4^+$ cation. Since the\\nBr$^-$ ions merely enhance structural stability of the perovskite framework and\\nSbH$_4^+$ not only sustains that stability but also reduces the band gap to\\nnearly ideal values and thereby improves electronic performance, these are the\\nleading candidates among them. Of them, the reduced band gap SbH$_4$PbI$_3$\\n($\\\\sim$1.37 eV) and the perfectly matched SbH$_4$PbBrI$_2$ with its band gap\\nbeing exactly 1.51 eV are top prospects for being stable and having\\nhigh-efficiency solar cell applications. The findings show that SbH$_4^+$-based\\nperovskites have potential for future photovoltaic devices.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T10:31:06Z\"}"}
