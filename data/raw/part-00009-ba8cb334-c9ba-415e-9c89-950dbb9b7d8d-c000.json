Focusing on a sample of 9\\nblazars, we analyze $\\\\gamma$-ray light curves to identify significant QPOs. In\\naddition to $\\\\gamma$-ray data, we incorporated polarized light data\\ncorresponding to the same temporal segments to cross-validate the presence of\\nQPOs. However, the limited availability of comprehensive polarized data\\nrestricted our ability to perform a thorough analysis across all datasets.\\nDespite these limitations, our analysis reveals a segment where QPOs in\\npolarized light coincided with those observed in $\\\\gamma$-rays, providing\\npreliminary evidence supporting the kink origin of these oscillations.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T15:18:14Z\"}"}
