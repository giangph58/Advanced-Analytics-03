{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10987v1\", \"title\": \"Leveraging Vertical Public-Private Split for Improved Synthetic Data\\n  Generation\", \"summary\": \"Differentially Private Synthetic Data Generation (DP-SDG) is a key enabler of\\nprivate and secure tabular-data sharing, producing artificial data that carries\\nthrough the underlying statistical properties of the input data. This typically\\ninvolves adding carefully calibrated statistical noise to guarantee individual\\nprivacy, at the cost of synthetic data quality. Recent literature has explored\\nscenarios where a small amount of public data is used to help enhance the\\nquality of synthetic data. These methods study a horizontal public-private\\npartitioning which assumes access to a small number of public rows that can be\\nused for model initialization, providing a small utility gain. However,\\nrealistic datasets often naturally consist of public and private attributes,\\nmaking a vertical public-private partitioning relevant for practical synthetic\\ndata deployments. We propose a novel framework that adapts horizontal\\npublic-assisted methods into the vertical setting. We compare this framework\\nagainst our alternative approach that uses conditional generation, highlighting\\ninitial limitations of public-data assisted methods and proposing future\\nresearch directions to address these challenges.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T08:59:03Z\"}"}
