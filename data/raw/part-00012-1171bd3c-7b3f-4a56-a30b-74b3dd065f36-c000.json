{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16404v1\", \"title\": \"Assessing the Feasibility of Internet-Sourced Video for Automatic Cattle\\n  Lameness Detection\", \"summary\": \"Cattle lameness is often caused by hoof injuries or interdigital dermatitis,\\nleads to pain and significantly impacts essential physiological activities such\\nas walking, feeding, and drinking. This study presents a deep learning-based\\nmodel for detecting cattle lameness, sickness, or gait abnormalities using\\npublicly available video data. The dataset consists of 50 unique videos from 40\\nindividual cattle, recorded from various angles in both indoor and outdoor\\nenvironments. Half of the dataset represents naturally walking\\n(normal/non-lame) cattle, while the other half consists of cattle exhibiting\\ngait abnormalities (lame). To enhance model robustness and generalizability,\\ndata augmentation was applied to the training data. The pre-processed videos\\nwere then classified using two deep learning models: ConvLSTM2D and 3D CNN. A\\ncomparative analysis of the results demonstrates strong classification\\nperformance. Specifically, the 3D CNN model achieved a video-level\\nclassification accuracy of 90%, with precision, recall, and f1-score of 90.9%,\\n90.9%, and 90.91% respectively. The ConvLSTM2D model exhibited a slightly lower\\naccuracy of 85%. This study highlights the effectiveness of directly applying\\nclassification models to learn spatiotemporal features from video data,\\noffering an alternative to traditional multi-stage approaches that typically\\ninvolve object detection, pose estimation, and feature extraction. Besides, the\\nfindings demonstrate that the proposed deep learning models, particularly the\\n3D CNN, effectively classify and detect lameness in cattle while simplifying\\nthe processing pipeline.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI,cs.LG,eess.IV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T04:17:41Z\"}"}
