With fault-tolerant implementation being a long-term\\ngoal, going beyond small molecules with existing error mitigation (EM)\\ntechniques with current noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices has\\nbeen a challenge. That being said, statistical learning methods are promising\\napproaches to learning the noise and its subsequent mitigation. We devise a\\ngraph neural network and regression-based machine learning (ML) architecture\\nfor practical realization of EM techniques for molecular Hamiltonian without\\nthe requirement of the exponential overhead. Given the short coherence time of\\nthe quantum hardware, the ML model is trained with either ideal or mitigated\\nexpectation values over a judiciously chosen ensemble of shallow sub-circuits\\nadhering to the native hardware architecture. The hardware connectivity network\\nis mapped to a directed graph which encodes the information of the native gate\\nnoise profile to generate the features for the neural network. The training\\ndata is generated on-the-fly during ansatz construction thus removing the\\ncomputational overhead. We demonstrate orders of magnitude improvements in\\npredicted energy over a few strongly correlated molecules.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T17:49:09Z\"}"}
