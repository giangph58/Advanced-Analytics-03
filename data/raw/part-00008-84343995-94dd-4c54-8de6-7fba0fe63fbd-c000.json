This paper develops a new approach for bounding the truncation\\nerror that arises when computing approximations to the stationary distribution.\\nThis rigorous a posteriori error bound exploits the regenerative structure of\\nthe chain and assumes knowledge of a Lyapunov function. Because the bound is a\\nposteriori (and leverages the computations done to calculate the stationary\\ndistribution itself), it tends to be much tighter than a priori bounds. The\\nbound decomposes the regenerative cycle into a random number of excursions from\\na set $K$ defined in terms of the Lyapunov function into the complement of the\\ntruncation set $A$. The bound can be easily computed, and does not (for\\nexample) involve a linear program, as do some other error bounds.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,cs.NA,math.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T04:10:09Z\"}"}
