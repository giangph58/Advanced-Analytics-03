First, we develop a computational model for SF6 photoionization and\\nprovide the detailed modeling process. Then, we perform comparative studies\\nagainst simplified approaches. The results demonstrate that the proposed model\\neffectively captures the non-local effects of SF6 photoionization, enhancing\\nboth the spatial numerical convergence and the accuracy of the streamer\\nstructure. Finally, we perform comparative studies by artificially increasing\\nthe photoionization intensity through multiplying the photoionization source\\nterm Sph by a factor of 10 (10*Sph) relative to the baseline intensity.\\nRegarding breakdown voltage prediction, 10*Sph leads to a significant\\nunderestimation of the breakdown voltage for positive streamers, introducing\\nerrors greater than 0.5 kV, while exerting a relatively small impact on\\nnegative streamers. Regarding streamer propagation dynamics, 10*Sph reduces the\\ncontraction at the positive streamer head and significantly lowers the local\\nfield by more than 700 Td, thereby slowing down its speed. In contrast, 10*Sph\\nhas little impact on the morphology of the negative streamers and slightly\\nenhances the local field by less than 200 Td, thereby consistently accelerating\\nits propagation.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:10:39Z\"}"}
