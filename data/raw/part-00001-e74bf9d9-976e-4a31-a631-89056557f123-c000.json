{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19579v1\", \"title\": \"Latest developments in wide-field VLBI\", \"summary\": \"Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) combines the signals of telescopes\\ndistributed across thousands of kilometres to provide some of the highest\\nangular resolution images of astrophysical phenomena. Due to computational\\nexpense, typical VLBI observations are restricted to a single target and a\\nsmall (few arcseconds) field-of-view per pointing. The technique of wide-field\\nVLBI was born to enable the targeting of multiple sources and has been\\nsuccessful in providing new insights into Active Galactic Nuclei, the\\ninterstellar medium, supernovae, gravitational lenses and much more. However,\\nthis technique is still only employed in a few experiments, restricting the\\nscientific potential of VLBI observations. In this conference proceeding, we\\noutline new developments in wide-field VLBI, including an end-to-end\\ncorrelation and calibration workflow, distributed correlation, and new\\ncalibration routines. These developments aim to enable wide-field VLBI to be a\\nstandard observing mode on all major VLBI arrays.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T08:37:22Z\"}"}
