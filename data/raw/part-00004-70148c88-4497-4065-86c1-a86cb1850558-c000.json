However, because of conflicting requirements, the\\ndesign of suitable inorganic crystals with strong second-harmonic generation\\n(SHG) has proven to be challenging to both experimentalists and computational\\nscientists. In this work, we leverage a data-driven approach to accelerate the\\nsearch for high-performance NLO materials. We construct an extensive pool of\\ncandidates using databases within the OPTIMADE federation and employ an active\\nlearning strategy to gather optimal data while iteratively improving a machine\\nlearning model. The result is a publicly accessible dataset of $\\\\sim$2,200\\ncomputed SHG tensors using density-functional perturbation theory. We further\\nassess the performance of machine learning models on SHG prediction and\\nintroduce a multi-fidelity correction-learning scheme to refine data accuracy.\\nThis study represents a significant step towards data-driven materials\\ndiscovery in the NLO field and demonstrates how new materials can be screened\\nin an automated fashion.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T09:13:08Z\"}"}
