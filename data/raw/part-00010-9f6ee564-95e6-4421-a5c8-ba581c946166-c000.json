{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16531v1\", \"title\": \"Pure Error REML for Analyzing Data from Multi-Stratum Designs\", \"summary\": \"Since the dawn of response surface methodology, it has been recommended that\\ndesigns include replicate points, so that pure error estimates of variance can\\nbe obtained and used to provide unbiased estimated standard errors of the\\neffects of factors. In designs with more than one stratum, such as split-plot\\nand split-split-plot designs, it is less obvious how pure error estimates of\\nthe variance components should be obtained, and no pure error estimates are\\ngiven by the popular residual maximum likelihood (REML) method of estimation.\\nWe propose a method of pure error REML estimation of the variance components,\\nusing the full treatment model, obtained by treating each combination of factor\\nlevels as a discrete treatment. Our method is easy to implement using standard\\nsoftware and improved estimated standard errors of the fixed effects estimates\\ncan be obtained by applying the Kenward-Roger correction based on the pure\\nerror REML estimates. We illustrate the new method using several data sets and\\ncompare the performance of pure error REML with the standard REML method. The\\nresults are comparable when the assumed response surface model is correct, but\\nthe new method is considerably more robust in the case of model\\nmisspecification.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T08:55:42Z\"}"}
