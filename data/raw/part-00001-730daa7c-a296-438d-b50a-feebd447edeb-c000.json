{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20001v1\", \"title\": \"Engineering Minimal k-Perfect Hash Functions\", \"summary\": \"Given a set S of n keys, a k-perfect hash function (kPHF) is a data structure\\nthat maps the keys to the first m integers, where each output integer can be\\nhit by at most k input keys. When m=n/k, the resulting function is called a\\nminimal k-perfect hash function (MkPHF). Applications of kPHFs can be found in\\nexternal memory data structures or to create efficient 1-perfect hash\\nfunctions, which in turn have a wide range of applications from databases to\\nbioinformatics. Several papers from the 1980s look at external memory data\\nstructures with small internal memory indexes. However, actual k-perfect hash\\nfunctions are surprisingly rare, and the area has not seen a lot of research\\nrecently. At the same time, recent research in 1-perfect hashing shows that\\nthere is a lack of efficient kPHFs. In this paper, we revive the area of\\nk-perfect hashing, presenting four new constructions. Our implementations\\nsimultaneously dominate older approaches in space consumption, construction\\ntime, and query time. We see this paper as a possible starting point of an\\nactive line of research, similar to the area of 1-perfect hashing.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:22:40Z\"}"}
