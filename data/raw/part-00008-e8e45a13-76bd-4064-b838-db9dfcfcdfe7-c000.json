{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12157v1\", \"title\": \"FocusedAD: Character-centric Movie Audio Description\", \"summary\": \"Movie Audio Description (AD) aims to narrate visual content during\\ndialogue-free segments, particularly benefiting blind and visually impaired\\n(BVI) audiences. Compared with general video captioning, AD demands\\nplot-relevant narration with explicit character name references, posing unique\\nchallenges in movie understanding.To identify active main characters and focus\\non storyline-relevant regions, we propose FocusedAD, a novel framework that\\ndelivers character-centric movie audio descriptions. It includes: (i) a\\nCharacter Perception Module(CPM) for tracking character regions and linking\\nthem to names; (ii) a Dynamic Prior Module(DPM) that injects contextual cues\\nfrom prior ADs and subtitles via learnable soft prompts; and (iii) a Focused\\nCaption Module(FCM) that generates narrations enriched with plot-relevant\\ndetails and named characters. To overcome limitations in character\\nidentification, we also introduce an automated pipeline for building character\\nquery banks. FocusedAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple\\nbenchmarks, including strong zero-shot results on MAD-eval-Named and our newly\\nproposed Cinepile-AD dataset. Code and data will be released at\\nhttps://github.com/Thorin215/FocusedAD .\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,I.2.10\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T15:04:14Z\"}"}
