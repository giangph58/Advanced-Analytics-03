In\\nthis work, we introduce a new model, the hierarchical multiplex stochastic\\nblockmodel (HMPSBM), that simultaneously detects communities within individual\\nlayers of a multiplex network while inferring a global node clustering across\\nthe layers. A stochastic blockmodel is assumed in each layer, with\\nprobabilities of layer-level group memberships determined by a node's global\\ngroup assignment. Our model uses a Bayesian framework, employing a probit\\nstick-breaking process to construct node-specific mixing proportions over a set\\nof shared Griffiths-Engen-McCloseky (GEM) distributions. These proportions\\ndetermine layer-level community assignment, allowing for an unknown and varying\\nnumber of groups across layers, while incorporating nodal covariate information\\nto inform the global clustering. We propose a scalable variational inference\\nprocedure with parallelisable updates for application to large networks.\\nExtensive simulation studies demonstrate our model's ability to accurately\\nrecover both global and layer-level clusters in complicated settings, and\\napplications to real data showcase the model's effectiveness in uncovering\\ninteresting latent network structure.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T11:27:48Z\"}"}
