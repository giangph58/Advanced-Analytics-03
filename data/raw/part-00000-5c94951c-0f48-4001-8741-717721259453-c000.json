{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00520v1\", \"title\": \"Proportionality in Practice: Quantifying Proportionality in Ordinal\\n  Elections\", \"summary\": \"Proportional representation plays a crucial role in electoral systems. In\\nordinal elections, where voters rank candidates based on their preferences, the\\nSingle Transferable Vote (STV) is the most widely used proportional voting\\nmethod. STV is considered proportional because it satisfies an axiom requiring\\nthat large enough solid coalitions of voters are adequately represented. Using\\nreal-world data from local Scottish elections, we observe that solid coalitions\\nof the required size rarely occur in practice. This observation challenges the\\nimportance of proportionality axioms and raises the question of how the\\nproportionality of voting methods can be assessed beyond their axiomatic\\nperformance. We address these concerns by developing quantitative measures of\\nproportionality. We apply these measures to evaluate the proportionality of\\nvoting rules on real-world election data. Besides STV, we consider SNTV, the\\nExpanding Approvals Rule, and Sequential Ranked-Choice Voting. We also study\\nthe effects of ballot truncation by artificially completing truncated ballots\\nand comparing the proportionality of outcomes under complete and truncated\\nballots.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GT\", \"categories\": \"cs.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T13:41:42Z\"}"}
