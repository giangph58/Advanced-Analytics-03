The rate of this process is controlled\\nby the ability of the liquid to move through the meshwork of solid elements\\nwithin the cell. While such dynamics have been interpreted in the frame of the\\nporoelastic theory in the cytoplasm, the behavior of the nucleus remains\\nunknown due to a lack of technique to probe it. Brillouin light scattering\\n(BLS) allows to interrogate the sound velocity and attenuation of a sample in a\\nnon-contact manner, thus revealing the dynamic response of the material. In\\ncells, such data were initially interpreted as the viscoelastic response of the\\nactin meshwork, but later studies pointed out the importance of water content.\\nTo resolve this lack of consensus in the interpretation of the hypersonic data\\nobtained from BLS spectra, and investigate the possible poroelastic nature of\\nthe nucleus, we vary the relative volume fraction of intracellular water and\\nsolid network by applying osmotic compressions to single cells. In the nucleus,\\nwe observe a non-linear increase in the sound velocity and attenuation with\\nincreasing osmotic pressure that we fit to a poroelastic model, providing an\\nestimate of the friction coefficient between the water phase and the network.\\nBy comparing BLS data to volume measurements, our approach demonstrates clearly\\nthat Brillouin microscopy actually provides a measure of molecular\\nconcentration in living cells\", \"main_category\": \"physics.bio-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.bio-ph,cond-mat.soft,q-bio.QM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T08:23:40Z\"}"}
