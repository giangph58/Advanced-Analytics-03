{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16524v1\", \"title\": \"Modality Reliability Guided Multimodal Recommendation\", \"summary\": \"Multimodal recommendation faces an issue of the performance degradation that\\nthe uni-modal recommendation sometimes achieves the better performance. A\\npossible reason is that the unreliable item modality data hurts the fusion\\nresult. Several existing studies have introduced weights for different\\nmodalities to reduce the contribution of the unreliable modality data in\\npredicting the final user rating. However, they fail to provide appropriate\\nsupervisions for learning the modality weights, making the learned weights\\nimprecise. Therefore, we propose a modality reliability guided multimodal\\nrecommendation framework that uniquely learns the modality weights supervised\\nby the modality reliability. Considering that there is no explicit label\\nprovided for modality reliability, we resort to automatically identify it\\nthrough the BPR recommendation objective. In particular, we define a modality\\nreliability vector as the supervision label by the difference between\\nmodality-specific user ratings to positive and negative items, where a larger\\ndifference indicates a higher reliability of the modality as the BPR objective\\nis better satisfied. Furthermore, to enhance the effectiveness of the\\nsupervision, we calculate the confidence level for the modality reliability\\nvector, which dynamically adjusts the supervision strength and eliminates the\\nharmful supervision. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show\\nthe effectiveness of the proposed method.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T08:46:23Z\"}"}
