{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14914v1\", \"title\": \"K-DRIFT Preparation: Experimental Verification of an Observation\\n  Strategy for Accurate Dark-Sky Flats\", \"summary\": \"Despite its scientific importance, the low-surface-brightness universe has\\nyet to be fully explored due to various systematic uncertainties that affect\\nthe achievable surface-brightness limit. Reducing these uncertainties requires\\nvery accurate data processing. The dark-sky flat is a widely used calibration\\nframe for accurate flat-field correction, generated by combining the sky\\nbackground from science images. However, the night sky will likely contain\\ncomplex local fluctuations, thus may still lead to photometric errors in data\\ncalibrated with dark-sky flats. To address this concern, we conduct mock\\nobservations with semi-realistic sky simulation data and evaluate observation\\nstrategies to mitigate the impact of the fluctuating sky background. Our\\nexperiments consider two representative sky conditions (clear and dirty) and\\nperform intensive comparative analysis on two observation methods (offset and\\nrolling). Our findings suggest that the rolling dithering method, which\\nincorporates the operation of camera rotation into conventional dithering, can\\nprovide more accurate dark-sky flats. Finally, we discuss the broader\\nimplications of this method through additional experiments examining several\\nfactors that may affect the imaging quality of observational data.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T07:32:49Z\"}"}
