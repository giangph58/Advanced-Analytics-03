{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06071v1\", \"title\": \"On Onsager-type conjecture for the Els\\u00e4sser energies of the ideal\\n  MHD equations\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we investigate the ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations\\non tours $\\\\TTT^d$. For $d=3$, we resolve the flexible part of Onsager-type\\nconjecture for Els\\\\\\\"{a}sser energies of the ideal MHD equations. More\\nprecisely, for \\\\(\\\\beta < 1/3\\\\), we construct weak solutions \\\\((u, b) \\\\in\\nC^\\\\beta([0,T] \\\\times \\\\mathbb{T}^3)\\\\) with both the total energy dissipation and\\nfailure of cross helicity conservation. The key idea of the proof relies on a\\nsymmetry reduction that embeds the ideal MHD system into a 2$\\\\frac{1}{2}$D\\nEuler flow and the Newton-Nash iteration technique recently developed in\\n\\\\cite{GR}. For $d=2$, we show the non-uniqueness of H\\\\\\\"{o}lder-continuous weak\\nsolutions with non-trivial magnetic fields. Specifically, for \\\\(\\\\beta < 1/5\\\\),\\nthere exist infinitely many solutions \\\\((u, b) \\\\in C^\\\\beta([0,T] \\\\times\\n\\\\mathbb{T}^2)\\\\) with the same initial data while satisfying the total energy\\ndissipation with non-vanishing velocity and magnetic fields. The new ingredient\\nis developing a spatial-separation-driven iterative scheme that incorporates\\nthe magnetic field as a controlled perturbation within the convex integration\\nframework for the velocity field, thereby providing sufficient oscillatory\\nfreedom for Nash-type perturbations in the 2D setting. As a byproduct, we prove\\nthat any H\\\\\\\"{o}lder-continuous Euler solution can be approximated by a sequence\\nof $C^\\\\beta$-weak solutions for the ideal MHD equations in the $L^p$-topology\\nfor $1\\\\le p<\\\\infty$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:11:11Z\"}"}
