As the frequency and scale of HPAI H5\\noutbreaks continue to rise, understanding how wild birds contribute to shape\\nthe global virus spread across regions, affecting poultry, domestic and wild\\nmammals, is increasingly critical. In this review, we examine ecological and\\nevolutionary studies to map the global transmission routes of HPAI H5 viruses,\\nidentify key wild bird species involved in viral dissemination, and explore\\ninfection patterns, including mortality and survival. We also highlight major\\nremaining knowledge gaps that hinder a full understanding of wild birds role in\\nviral dynamics, which must be addressed to enhance surveillance strategies and\\nrefine risk assessment models aimed at preventing future outbreaks in wildlife,\\ndomestic animals and safeguard public health.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.PE\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.PE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T09:42:40Z\"}"}
