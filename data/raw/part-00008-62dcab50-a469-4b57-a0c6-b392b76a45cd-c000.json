This SoK\\nprovides a comprehensive analysis of security vulnerabilities in EMV\\ncontactless payments, particularly within the open-loop systems used by Visa\\nand Mastercard. We categorize attacks into seven attack vectors across three\\nkey areas: application selection, cardholder authentication, and transaction\\nauthorization. We replicate the attacks on Visa and Mastercard protocols using\\nour experimental platform to determine their practical feasibility and offer\\ninsights into the current security landscape of contactless payments. Our study\\nalso includes a detailed evaluation of the underlying protocols, along with a\\ncomparative analysis of Visa and Mastercard, highlighting vulnerabilities and\\nrecommending countermeasures.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T10:16:48Z\"}"}
