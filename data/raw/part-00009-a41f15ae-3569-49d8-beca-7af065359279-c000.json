{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11286v1\", \"title\": \"Efficient Medical Image Restoration via Reliability Guided Learning in\\n  Frequency Domain\", \"summary\": \"Medical image restoration tasks aim to recover high-quality images from\\ndegraded observations, exhibiting emergent desires in many clinical scenarios,\\nsuch as low-dose CT image denoising, MRI super-resolution, and MRI artifact\\nremoval. Despite the success achieved by existing deep learning-based\\nrestoration methods with sophisticated modules, they struggle with rendering\\ncomputationally-efficient reconstruction results. Moreover, they usually ignore\\nthe reliability of the restoration results, which is much more urgent in\\nmedical systems. To alleviate these issues, we present LRformer, a Lightweight\\nTransformer-based method via Reliability-guided learning in the frequency\\ndomain. Specifically, inspired by the uncertainty quantification in Bayesian\\nneural networks (BNNs), we develop a Reliable Lesion-Semantic Prior Producer\\n(RLPP). RLPP leverages Monte Carlo (MC) estimators with stochastic sampling\\noperations to generate sufficiently-reliable priors by performing multiple\\ninferences on the foundational medical image segmentation model, MedSAM.\\nAdditionally, instead of directly incorporating the priors in the spatial\\ndomain, we decompose the cross-attention (CA) mechanism into real symmetric and\\nimaginary anti-symmetric parts via fast Fourier transform (FFT), resulting in\\nthe design of the Guided Frequency Cross-Attention (GFCA) solver. By leveraging\\nthe conjugated symmetric property of FFT, GFCA reduces the computational\\ncomplexity of naive CA by nearly half. Extensive experimental results in\\nvarious tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LRformer in both\\neffectiveness and efficiency.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:26:28Z\"}"}
