{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05099v1\", \"title\": \"Balancing Client Participation in Federated Learning Using AoI\", \"summary\": \"Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized framework that preserves data\\nprivacy while enabling collaborative model training across distributed clients.\\nHowever, FL faces significant challenges due to limited communication\\nresources, statistical heterogeneity, and the need for balanced client\\nparticipation. This paper proposes an Age of Information (AoI)-based client\\nselection policy that addresses these challenges by minimizing load imbalance\\nthrough controlled selection intervals. Our method employs a decentralized\\nMarkov scheduling policy, allowing clients to independently manage\\nparticipation based on age-dependent selection probabilities, which balances\\nclient updates across training rounds with minimal central oversight. We\\nprovide a convergence proof for our method, demonstrating that it ensures\\nstable and efficient model convergence. Specifically, we derive optimal\\nparameters for the Markov selection model to achieve balanced and consistent\\nclient participation, highlighting the benefits of AoI in enhancing convergence\\nstability. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our AoI-based\\nmethod, particularly the optimal Markov variant, improves convergence over the\\nFedAvg selection approach across both IID and non-IID data settings by $7.5\\\\%$\\nand up to $20\\\\%$. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of AoI-based\\nscheduling for scalable, fair, and efficient FL systems across diverse learning\\nenvironments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T09:55:28Z\"}"}
