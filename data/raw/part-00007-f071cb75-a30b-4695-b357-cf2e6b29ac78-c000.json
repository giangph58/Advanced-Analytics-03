Vibrations, excited mechanochemically or by\\nexternal stimuli, dissipate energy into substrate electrons and phonons. Energy\\ndissipation leads to the broadening of spectral lines, vibrational lifetimes,\\nand the coupling between molecular and substrate phonons. It affects molecular\\nmanipulation, giving rise to nanoscale friction, and contributes to scanning\\nprobe and surface spectroscopy signals. We present an approach to disentangle\\nadsorbate vibrational dynamics in non-contact junctions by employing density\\nfunctional theory, machine learning, and non-adiabatic molecular dynamics.\\nFocusing on the CO-functionalised Cu surfaces representing a single-molecule\\njunction, a widely studied system in scanning probe and energy dissipation\\nexperiments, we reveal strong vibrational mode specificity governed by the\\ninterplay of electron-phonon and phonon-phonon coupling. Electron-phonon\\nrelaxation rates vary by two orders of magnitude between modes and sensitively\\ndepend on the tip-substrate geometry. We find evidence of a weak non-additive\\neffect between both energy dissipation channels, where electron-phonon coupling\\nenhances phonon-phonon coupling. Our predicted vibrational lifetimes agree with\\ninfrared spectroscopy and helium scattering experiments. Finally, we outline\\nhow our findings can inform and enhance scanning probe experiments.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:07:59Z\"}"}
