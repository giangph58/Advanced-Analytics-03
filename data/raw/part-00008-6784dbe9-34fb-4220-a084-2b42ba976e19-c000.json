To address this, we propose\\nan orthogonal-polynomial-based quantum reduced-order model (PolyQROM) that\\nintegrates orthogonal polynomial basis transformations with variational quantum\\ncircuits (VQCs). PolyQROM employs optimized polynomial-based quantum operations\\nto compress flow field data into low-dimensional representations while\\npreserving essential features, enabling efficient quantum or classical\\npost-processing for tasks like reconstruction and classification. By leveraging\\nthe mathematical properties of orthogonal polynomials, the framework enhances\\ncircuit expressivity and stabilizes training compared to conventional\\nhardware-efficient VQCs. Numerical experiments demonstrate PolyQROM's\\neffectiveness in reconstructing flow fields with high fidelity and classifying\\nflow patterns with accuracy surpassing classical methods and quantum\\nbenchmarks, all while reducing computational complexity and parameter counts.\\nThe work bridges quantum simulation outputs with practical fluid analysis,\\naddressing the ``output problem'' through efficient reduced-order modeling\\ntailored for quantum-encoded flow data, offering a scalable pathway to exploit\\nquantum advantages in computational fluid dynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T12:14:08Z\"}"}
