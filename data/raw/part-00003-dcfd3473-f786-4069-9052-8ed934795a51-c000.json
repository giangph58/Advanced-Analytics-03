Several instances of low frequency Quasi-Periodic Oscillations\\n(QPOs) have been reported in ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), including\\nthree in pulsating ones (PULXs) to date. The nature of many ULXs is still\\nunclear, as are the detailed properties of accretion in PULXs. Aims. We seek an\\nanswer to questions such as: Is there a QPO model that fits the data? Can mHz\\nQPOs be used to constrain the magnetic field and accretion rate of the neutron\\nstars in PULXs? Are all the low frequency QPOs in ULXs a manifestation of the\\nsame phenomenon? Methods. We apply Dong Lai's precession model to the PULX\\ndata, with the magnetic threading of the accretion disk constrained by recent\\nsimulations. Results. Based on the magnetic precession model, and on recent\\nprogress in understanding the inner structure of accretion disks, we predict an\\ninverse scaling of QPO frequency with the neutron star period in PULXs. The\\ntheoretical curve is largely independent of the stellar magnetic field or mass\\naccretion rate and agrees with the data for the known QPOs in PULXs. The\\nflat-top QPOs detected in ULXs have observational properties that seem to be\\nvery different from the QPOs detected in PULXs, indicating they might have a\\ndifferent origin.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T15:56:39Z\"}"}
