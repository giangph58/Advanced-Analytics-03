{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09882v1\", \"title\": \"SIO-Mapper: A Framework for Lane-Level HD Map Construction Using\\n  Satellite Images and OpenStreetMap with No On-Site Visits\", \"summary\": \"High-definition (HD) maps, particularly those containing lane-level\\ninformation regarded as ground truth, are crucial for vehicle localization\\nresearch. Traditionally, constructing HD maps requires highly accurate sensor\\nmeasurements collection from the target area, followed by manual annotation to\\nassign semantic information. Consequently, HD maps are limited in terms of\\ngeographic coverage. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose\\nSIO-Mapper, a novel lane-level HD map construction framework that constructs\\ncity-scale maps without physical site visits by utilizing satellite images and\\nOpenStreetmap data. One of the key contributions of SIO-Mapper is its ability\\nto extract lane information more accurately by introducing SIO-Net, a novel\\ndeep learning network that integrates features from satellite image and\\nOpenStreetmap using both Transformer-based and convolution-based encoders.\\nFurthermore, to overcome challenges in merging lanes over large areas, we\\nintroduce a novel lane integration methodology that combines cluster-based and\\ngraph-based approaches. This algorithm ensures the seamless aggregation of lane\\nsegments with high accuracy and coverage, even in complex road environments. We\\nvalidated SIO-Mapper on the Naver Labs Open Dataset and NuScenes dataset,\\ndemonstrating better performance in various environments including Korea, the\\nUnited States, and Singapore compared to the state-of-the-art lane-level HD\\nmapconstruction methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T05:10:57Z\"}"}
