{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16932v1\", \"title\": \"Dispu$\\u03c4$able: the high cost of a low optical depth\", \"summary\": \"Recent Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy\\nSpectroscopic Instrument (DESI) are mildly discrepant ($2.2\\\\sigma$) with the\\nCosmic Microwave Background (CMB) when interpreted within $\\\\Lambda$CDM. When\\nanalyzing these data with extended cosmologies this inconsistency manifests as\\na $\\\\simeq3\\\\sigma$ preference for sub-minimal neutrino mass or evolving dark\\nenergy. It is known that the preference for sub-minimal neutrino mass from the\\nsuppression of structure growth could be alleviated by increasing the optical\\ndepth to reionization $\\\\tau$. We show that, because the CMB-inferred $\\\\tau$ is\\nnegatively correlated with the matter fraction, a larger optical depth resolves\\na similar preference from geometric constraints. Optical depths large enough to\\nresolve the neutrino mass tension ($\\\\tau\\\\sim0.09)$ also reduce the preference\\nfor evolving dark energy from $\\\\simeq3\\\\sigma$ to $\\\\simeq1.5\\\\sigma$. Conversely,\\nwithin $\\\\Lambda$CDM the combination of DESI BAO, high-$\\\\ell$ CMB and CMB\\nlensing yields $\\\\tau = 0.090 \\\\pm 0.012$. The required increase in $\\\\tau$ is in\\n$\\\\simeq3-5\\\\sigma$ tension with Planck low-$\\\\ell$ polarization data when taken\\nat face value. While there is no evidence for systematics in the large-scale\\nPlanck data, $\\\\tau$ remains the least well-constrained $\\\\Lambda$CDM parameter\\nand is far from its cosmic variance limit. The importance of $\\\\tau$ for several\\ncosmological measurements strengthens the case for future large-scale CMB\\nexperiments as well as direct probes of the epoch of reionization.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T17:59:56Z\"}"}
