Such damping estimates, consisting of $H^s$ energy\\nestimates yielding exponential slaving of high-derivative to low-derivative\\nnorms, have served as crucial ingredients in nonlinear stability analyses of\\ntraveling waves in hyperbolic or partially parabolic systems, both in obtaining\\nhigh-freqency resolvent estimates and in closing a nonlinear iteration for\\nwhich available linearized stability estimates apparently lose regularity.\\nHere, we establish for systems of size $n\\\\leq 6$ a Lyapunov-type theorem\\nstating that such energy estimates are available whenever strict high-frequency\\nspectral stability holds; for dimensions 7 and higher, there may be in general\\na gap between high-frequency spectral stability and existence of the type of\\nenergy estimate that we develop here. A key ingredient is a dimension-dependent\\nlinear algebraic lemma reminiscent of Lyapunov's Lemma for ODE that is to our\\nknowledge new.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T10:05:33Z\"}"}
