Using\\nan exactly solvable model, we explore how the interplay between RTN parameters\\nthe switching rate, coupling strength, and initial condition governs the\\ntransition between Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics. A coherence based\\nmeasure is employed to quantify non-Markovianity, and a unified quantum speed\\nlimit bound is derived based on relative purity. Our results reveal that in\\nthermodynamic equilibrium, non-Markovian memory effects significantly reduce\\nthe quantum speed limit time, accelerating quantum evolution through\\ninformation backflow. In contrast, under non-equilibrium initial conditions,\\nthe system exhibits purely Markovian behavior regardless of coupling strength,\\nalthough strong coupling still leads to speedup via enhanced dephasing. These\\nfindings offer valuable insights for designing fast and noise resilient quantum\\nprotocols by controlling both dynamical parameters and noise initialization.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T11:45:34Z\"}"}
