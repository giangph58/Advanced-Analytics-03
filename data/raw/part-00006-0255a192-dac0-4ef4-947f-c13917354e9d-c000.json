These solutions exhibit an\\nSO(6)-symmetric internal space constructed from a $\\\\mathbb{CP}^3$, and are\\nfully specified by a single cubic function controlling the fluxes and warping.\\nWe propose a brane box configuration underlying the solutions from which we\\nconstruct a two-dimensional quiver gauge theory whose anomaly structure and\\ncentral charge we analyse, and from which we can realise Seiberg-like dualities\\nas large gauge transformations. The brane box configuration suggests an\\ninterpretation of the solutions as dual to surface defects within the ABJ(M)\\ntheory. Our findings provide a concrete setting for exploring holography beyond\\nthe ABJM vacuum. Remarkably, no explicit field theories are currently known to\\nrealise $\\\\mathcal{N} = (0,6)$ supersymmetry in two dimensions, making our setup\\na promising and largely unexplored direction for field-theoretic\\ninvestigations.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T15:39:27Z\"}"}
