{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00301v1\", \"title\": \"Evidence for Core-Core Collision in Barnard 68\", \"summary\": \"The prestellar core Barnard 68 (B68) is a prototypical source to study the\\ninitial conditions and chemical processes of star formation. A previous\\nnumerical simulation suggested the southeastern bullet is impacting on the main\\nbody of B68. In order to obtain more observational evidence, mapping\\nobservations of the ground state SO ($1_0-0_1$) emission line at 30 GHz were\\nmade with the Effelsberg 100 m telescope. Based on the velocity field and\\nchannel maps derived from SO, three velocity components were clearly detected.\\nThe velocity field of the main body indicates rotation and is well fitted by a\\nsolid-body rotation model. The measured radial velocity difference between the\\nbullet and the main core is about 0.4 km s$^{-1}$, which is almost equal to the\\nvelocity obtained by the previous numerical simulation. Therefore, the bullet\\nis most likely impacting onto the rotating main body of B68. A 1D spherical\\nnon-LTE Monte-Carlo radiation transfer RATRAN code is performed to derive the\\nradial abundance profile of SO by analyzing the observed velocity-integrated\\nintensity. SO is depleted inside a 60$^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}$ (0.02 pc) radius from\\nthe core. The abundance stays constant at 2.0$\\\\times$10$^{-9}$ for radii larger\\nthan 60$^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}$ from the center of the main core. The abundance is\\nenhanced at the interface of the bullet and the main core indicating that shock\\nwaves were produced by the collision between the bullet and the main core. In\\nconclusion, based on the kinematical and chemical analysis, our observational\\nresults support the previously proposed core-core collision scenario in B68.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T04:44:52Z\"}"}
