By leveraging symmetries, we\\nprove the existence of a symmetric minimal partition through a variational\\napproach. A key ingredient in our analysis is a new H\\\\\\\"older regularity result\\nfor symmetric functions in a fractional Sobolev space on the sphere. As a\\nbyproduct, we establish the existence of infinitely many solutions to a\\nnonlocal weakly-coupled competitive system on the sphere that remain invariant\\nunder a group of conformal diffeomorphisms and we investigate the asymptotic\\nbehavior of least-energy solutions as the coupling parameters approach negative\\ninfinity.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T16:58:35Z\"}"}
