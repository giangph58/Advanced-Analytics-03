Previous works utilize neural fields together with\\nphysically based rendering (PBR), to estimate geometry and disentangle\\nappearance properties of human avatars. However, one drawback of these methods\\nis the slow rendering speed due to the expensive Monte Carlo ray tracing. To\\ntackle this problem, we proposed to distill the knowledge from implicit neural\\nfields (teacher) to explicit 2D Gaussian splatting (student) representation to\\ntake advantage of the fast rasterization property of Gaussian splatting. To\\navoid ray-tracing, we employ the split-sum approximation for PBR appearance. We\\nalso propose novel part-wise ambient occlusion probes for shadow computation.\\nShadow prediction is achieved by querying these probes only once per pixel,\\nwhich paves the way for real-time relighting of avatars. These techniques\\ncombined give high-quality relighting results with realistic shadow effects.\\nOur experiments demonstrate that the proposed student model achieves comparable\\nor even better relighting results with our teacher model while being 370 times\\nfaster at inference time, achieving a 67 FPS rendering speed.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:59:58Z\"}"}
