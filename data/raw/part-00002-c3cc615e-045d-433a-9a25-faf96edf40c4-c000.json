Many results in directed structural graph\\ntheory use this notion as a central tool next to directed treewidth, a\\ngeneralisation of the width measure treewidth to directed graphs. Adler\\n[JCTB'07] showed that the directed treewidth is not closed under taking\\nbutterfly minors. Over the years, many alternative definitions for directed\\ntreewidth appeared throughout the literature, equivalent to the original\\ndefinition up to small functions. In this paper, we consider the major ones and\\nshow that not all of them share the problem identified by Adler.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,cs.DM\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T11:40:22Z\"}"}
