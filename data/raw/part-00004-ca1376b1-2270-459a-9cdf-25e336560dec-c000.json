{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04376v1\", \"title\": \"Label-efficient Single Photon Images Classification via Active Learning\", \"summary\": \"Single-photon LiDAR achieves high-precision 3D imaging in extreme\\nenvironments through quantum-level photon detection technology. Current\\nresearch primarily focuses on reconstructing 3D scenes from sparse photon\\nevents, whereas the semantic interpretation of single-photon images remains\\nunderexplored, due to high annotation costs and inefficient labeling\\nstrategies. This paper presents the first active learning framework for\\nsingle-photon image classification. The core contribution is an imaging\\ncondition-aware sampling strategy that integrates synthetic augmentation to\\nmodel variability across imaging conditions. By identifying samples where the\\nmodel is both uncertain and sensitive to these conditions, the proposed method\\nselectively annotates only the most informative examples. Experiments on both\\nsynthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms all\\nbaselines and achieves high classification accuracy with significantly fewer\\nlabeled samples. Specifically, our approach achieves 97% accuracy on synthetic\\nsingle-photon data using only 1.5% labeled samples. On real-world data, we\\nmaintain 90.63% accuracy with just 8% labeled samples, which is 4.51% higher\\nthan the best-performing baseline. This illustrates that active learning\\nenables the same level of classification performance on single-photon images as\\non classical images, opening doors to large-scale integration of single-photon\\ndata in real-world applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T12:57:40Z\"}"}
