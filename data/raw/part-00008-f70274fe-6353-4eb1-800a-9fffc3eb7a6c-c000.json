{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06874v1\", \"title\": \"Optical imaging of spontaneous electric polarizations in tetralayer\\n  graphene\", \"summary\": \"The recent discovery of sliding ferroelectricity has sparked intense\\ninterests in studying interfacial polarizations in two-dimensional (2D) van der\\nWaals materials. However, akin to the conventional ferroelectrics, the studies\\nhave predominantly reported semiconducting and/or insulating moir\\\\'e systems\\nand binary compounds. Spontaneous electric polarizations in elemental metallic\\nphases remain scarcity. Here, we report the first optical imaging of intrinsic\\nout-of-plane electric polarizations and domain wall (DW) sliding dynamics in\\ntetralayer graphene, a 2D conductive layer composed entirely of carbon. Using\\nscanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM), we directly visualize adjacent\\nABAC and ABCB stacking orders with intrinsic and opposite electric\\npolarizations. Our gate-dependent SNOM measurements reveal distinct optical\\nresponse that systematically changes upon carrier doping and unconventional\\ninterplay between DW sliding and electric polarizations, which are supported by\\ndensity functional theory (DFT) calculations. Independent corroboration through\\nKelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and Raman spectroscopy confirms the polar\\nnature and their polarization directions. Furthermore, reversible mechanical\\nswitching of polar states via atomic force microscopy (AFM) tip manipulation is\\nalso demonstrated. Our work establishes SNOM as a critical tool for probing\\nsliding ferroelectricity in conductive 2D layers, opening avenues for exploring\\nmultiferroic behaviors and nonvolatile memory applications in atomically thin\\nmetals at room temperature.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:26:25Z\"}"}
