{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19913v1\", \"title\": \"Lossy Source Coding with Focal Loss\", \"summary\": \"Focal loss has recently gained significant popularity, particularly in tasks\\nlike object detection where it helps to address class imbalance by focusing\\nmore on hard-to-classify examples. This work proposes the focal loss as a\\ndistortion measure for lossy source coding. The paper provides single-shot\\nconverse and achievability bounds. These bounds are then used to characterize\\nthe distortion-rate trade-off in the infinite blocklength, which is shown to be\\nthe same as that for the log loss case. In the non-asymptotic case, the\\ndifference between focal loss and log loss is illustrated through a series of\\nsimulations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:42:34Z\"}"}
