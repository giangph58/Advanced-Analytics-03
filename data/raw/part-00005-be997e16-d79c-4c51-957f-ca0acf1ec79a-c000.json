On the other hand, a moire pattern can form by\\nsuperimposing two periodic structures along a particular direction. Up to now,\\nsupersolids and moire states are disconnected from each other. In this work we\\nshow that exciton polariton supersolids can form moire states in a double\\ndegenerate parametric scattering process which creates two constituted\\nsupersolids with different periods in a liquid crystal microcavity. In\\naddition, we demonstrate the nonrigidity of the moire exciton polariton\\nsupersolids by electrically tuning the wavevector and period of one supersolid\\ncomponent with another one being fixed. Our work finds a simple way to link\\nmoire states and supersolids, which offers to study nontrivial physics emerging\\nfrom the combination of moire lattices and supersolids which can be\\nelectrically tuned at room temperature.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T10:44:29Z\"}"}
