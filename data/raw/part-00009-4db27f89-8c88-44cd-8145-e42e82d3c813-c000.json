{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21618v1\", \"title\": \"Overlapping data in network protocols: bridging OS and NIDS reassembly\\n  gap\", \"summary\": \"IPv4, IPv6, and TCP have a common mechanism allowing one to split an original\\ndata packet into several chunks. Such chunked packets may have overlapping data\\nportions and, OS network stack implementations may reassemble these overlaps\\ndifferently. A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that tries to\\nreassemble a given flow data has to use the same reassembly policy as the\\nmonitored host OS; otherwise, the NIDS or the host may be subject to attack. In\\nthis paper, we provide several contributions that enable us to analyze NIDS\\nresistance to overlapping data chunks-based attacks. First, we extend\\nstate-of-the-art insertion and evasion attack characterizations to address\\ntheir limitations in an overlap-based context. Second, we propose a new way to\\nmodel overlap types using Allen's interval algebra, a spatio-temporal\\nreasoning. This new modeling allows us to formalize overlap test cases, which\\nensures exhaustiveness in overlap coverage and eases the reasoning about and\\nuse of reassembly policies. Third, we analyze the reassembly behavior of\\nseveral OSes and NIDSes when processing the modeled overlap test cases. We show\\nthat 1) OS reassembly policies evolve over time and 2) all the tested NIDSes\\nare (still) vulnerable to overlap-based evasion and insertion attacks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T13:15:50Z\"}"}
