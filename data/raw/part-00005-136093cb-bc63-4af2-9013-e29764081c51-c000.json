Here, we\\nshow that for an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) substrate, the observed orientation\\nand distance dependence of the spontaneous emission rate is reversed compared\\nto metals. This inverse Drexhage effect is studied for ideal ENZ and real ENZ\\nsubstrates compared with ideal and real metallic substrates. ENZ metamaterials\\nconsisting of a subwavelength metal-dielectric stack are shown to exhibit the\\nconventional Drexhage effects due to the large optical losses associated with\\nthese materials. Our results could find applications in quantum sensing,\\nquantum information, and energy-efficient optoelectronic devices.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T05:14:05Z\"}"}
