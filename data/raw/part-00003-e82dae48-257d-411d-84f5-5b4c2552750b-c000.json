However, current models require increasingly large datasets\\nfor training. Acquiring and labeling such data is costly, necessitating the\\ndevelopment of new strategies to optimize this process. Active learning is a\\npromising approach that has been extensively researched in the image domain. In\\nour work, we extend this concept to the LiDAR domain by developing several\\ninconsistency-based sample selection strategies and evaluate their\\neffectiveness in various settings. Our results show that using a naive\\ninconsistency approach based on the number of detected boxes, we achieve the\\nsame mAP as the random sampling strategy with 50% of the labeled data.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T13:29:56Z\"}"}
