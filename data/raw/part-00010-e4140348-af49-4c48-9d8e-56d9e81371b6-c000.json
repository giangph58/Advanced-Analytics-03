{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09996v1\", \"title\": \"Nonlinear transport of Wigner solid phase surrounding the two-flux\\n  composite fermion liquid\", \"summary\": \"We have investigated the low temperature (T) transport properties of\\nfractional quantum Hall (FQH) states in a high-mobility two-dimensional hole\\ngas. According to the composite fermion (CF) model, FQH states stemming from a\\nhalf-filled Landau level, specifically at filling factors ${\\\\nu}=p/(2p+1)\\n(p=\\\\pm 1,\\\\pm 2,\\\\pm 3,...)$, can be associated with two-flux-attached CFs at the\\ncorresponding Lambda filling factor p. The zero-resistance minima and Hall\\nplateaus of these states exhibit unusual temperature dependencies,\\ncharacterized by rapid increases in width below a threshold temperature around\\n100 mK. Differential conductivity measurements from Corbino samples reveal that\\nthe regimes surrounding the CF liquid display clear nonlinear transport\\ncharacteristics. This nonlinearity implies that each CF liquid is surrounded by\\nCF solid phase composed of dilute CF excitations. Quantitatively, the applied\\nelectric field E influences the motion of CF solid in a way analogous to T,\\nwhich is dubbed the \\\"E-T duality\\\". Our analysis indicates that this E-T duality\\nis consistent with the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless theory in\\ntwo-dimensional phase transitions.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:00:07Z\"}"}
