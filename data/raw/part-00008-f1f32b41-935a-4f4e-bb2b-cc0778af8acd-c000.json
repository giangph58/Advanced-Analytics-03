However, the theoretical understanding\\nand experimental implementation of robust OOP spin currents for high-density\\nand low-power magnetization switching remain significant challenges of\\nspintronics. Here, we demonstrate that transitioning NbIrTe$_4$ from a\\ntwo-dimensional quantum spin Hall insulator to a three-dimensional type-II Weyl\\nsemimetal markedly enhances OOP spin current generation. The bulk topological\\nWeyl semimetal nature of NbIrTe$_4$, characterized by its Weyl cone,\\nsignificantly enhances the OOP spin Berry curvature, enabling an unprecedented\\nOOP spin Hall conductivity exceeding $10^5\\\\hbar/2e$ $\\\\Omega^{-1}m^{-1} $. This\\nenhancement, surpassing the in-plane component by more than fourfold, enables\\nefficient and field-free spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching of perpendicular\\nmagnetization with a low current density of 1.4 MA/cm$^2$. The improved spin\\nHall conductivity reduces the overall power consumption by more than two orders\\nof magnitude compared to existing systems, such as heavy metals. Our findings\\nhighlight the pivotal role of dimensionality in harnessing robust OOP spin\\ncurrents in topological Weyl semimetals, paving the way for the development of\\nhigh-density, low-power spintronic memory technologies.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T17:29:56Z\"}"}
