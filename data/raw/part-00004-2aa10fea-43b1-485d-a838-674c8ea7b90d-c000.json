{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07800v1\", \"title\": \"A Systematic Approach to Hyperbolic Quantum Error Correction Codes\", \"summary\": \"Hyperbolic quantum error correction codes (HQECCs) leverage the unique\\ngeometric properties of hyperbolic space to enhance the capabilities and\\nperformance of quantum error correction. By embedding qubits in hyperbolic\\nlattices, HQECCs achieve higher encoding rates and improved error thresholds\\ncompared to conventional Euclidean codes. Building on recent advances in\\nhyperbolic crystallography, we present a systematic framework for constructing\\nHQECCs. As a key component of this framework, we develop a novel algorithm for\\ncomputing all plaquette cycles and logical operators associated with a given\\nHQECC. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we utilize this\\nframework to simulate two HQECCs based respectively on two relevant examples of\\nhyperbolic tilings. In the process, we evaluate key code parameters such as\\nencoding rate, error threshold, and code distance for different sub-lattices.\\nThis work establishes a solid foundation for a systematic and comprehensive\\nanalysis of HQECCs, paving the way for the practical implementation of HQECCs\\nin the pursuit of robust quantum error correction strategies.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.DS,math.AG,math.DG,math.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:38:10Z\"}"}
