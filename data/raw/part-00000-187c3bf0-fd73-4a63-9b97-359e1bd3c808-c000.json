A time-weighted\\nenergy argument has been developed within the $L^2$ framework to derive the\\noptimal time-decay rates, which enables us to remove the smallness of\\nlow-frequencies of initial data. A great part of our analysis relies on the\\nstudy of a Lyapunov functional in the spirit of [13], which mainly depends on\\nsome elaborate use of non-classical Besov product estimates and interpolations.\\nExhibiting a damped mode with faster time decay than the whole solution also\\nplays a key role.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T12:36:51Z\"}"}
