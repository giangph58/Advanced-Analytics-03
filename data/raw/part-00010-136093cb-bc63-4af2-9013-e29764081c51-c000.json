This work explores\\nthe charge-dependent $NN$ interaction in covariant chiral effective field\\ntheory. By incorporating the isospin-breaking contributions, we derive the\\ncharge-dependent covariant chiral $NN$ potential up to the\\nnext-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). The calculated $np$ and $pp$ phase shifts\\nare in satisfactory agreement with the PWA93 partial wave analysis. Our results\\ncontribute to a deeper understanding of the isospin-breaking effects in nuclear\\nforces and provide a solid foundation for future studies of nuclear structure\\nand reactions in the context of a covariant framework.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T05:29:45Z\"}"}
