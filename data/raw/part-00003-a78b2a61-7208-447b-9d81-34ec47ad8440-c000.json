{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07697v1\", \"title\": \"Transformer-Based Robust Underwater Inertial Navigation in Prolonged\\n  Doppler Velocity Log Outages\", \"summary\": \"Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) have a wide variety of applications in\\nthe marine domain, including exploration, surveying, and mapping. Their\\nnavigation systems rely heavily on fusing data from inertial sensors and a\\nDoppler velocity log (DVL), typically via nonlinear filtering. The DVL\\nestimates the AUV's velocity vector by transmitting acoustic beams to the\\nseabed and analyzing the Doppler shift from the reflected signals. However, due\\nto environmental challenges, DVL beams can deflect or fail in real-world\\nsettings, causing signal outages. In such cases, the AUV relies solely on\\ninertial data, leading to accumulated navigation errors and mission\\nterminations. To cope with these outages, we adopted ST-BeamsNet, a deep\\nlearning approach that uses inertial readings and prior DVL data to estimate\\nAUV velocity during isolated outages. In this work, we extend ST-BeamsNet to\\naddress prolonged DVL outages and evaluate its impact within an extended Kalman\\nfilter framework. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework improves\\nvelocity RMSE by up to 63% and reduces final position error by up to 95%\\ncompared to pure inertial navigation. This is in scenarios involving up to 50\\nseconds of complete DVL outage.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T12:31:55Z\"}"}
