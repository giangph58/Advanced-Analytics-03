In the $w_0, w_a$ parametrization\\nof $w$, there is a preference for a phantom crossing, $w<-1$, at redshift\\n$z\\\\sim0.5$. In general relativity, the phantom equation of state is unphysical.\\nThus it is important to check whether phantom crossing is present in other\\nphysically self-consistent models of dark energy that have equivalent evidence\\nto the $w_0, w_a$ parametrization. We find that thawing quintessence with\\nnonzero cosmic curvature can fit the recent data slightly better than $w_0,\\nw_a$ in a flat background. The phantom crossing may be a spurious artifact of a\\nparametrization that is not based on a physical model.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T16:00:28Z\"}"}
