However, we identified the following\\nlimitations: (i) they mainly focus on global structural characteristics and\\ntherefore overlook localized features that often carry critical pathological\\ninformation, and (ii) the SSIM loss function struggles to handle images with\\nvarying pixel intensities, luminance factors, and variance. In this study, we\\npropose Motion-Aware Image SYnthesis (MAISY) which initially characterize\\nmotion and then uses it for correction by: (a) leveraging the foundation model\\nSegment Anything Model (SAM), to dynamically learn spatial patterns along\\nanatomical boundaries where motion artifacts are most pronounced and, (b)\\nintroducing the Variance-Selective SSIM (VS-SSIM) loss which adaptively\\nemphasizes spatial regions with high pixel variance to preserve essential\\nanatomical details during artifact correction. Experiments on chest and head CT\\ndatasets demonstrate that our model outperformed the state-of-the-art\\ncounterparts, with Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) increasing by 40%, SSIM by\\n10%, and Dice by 16%.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T03:44:28Z\"}"}
