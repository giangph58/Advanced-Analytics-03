{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17489v1\", \"title\": \"Towards Equitable Rail Service Allocation Through Fairness-Oriented\\n  Timetabling in Liberalized Markets\", \"summary\": \"Over the last few decades, European rail transport has undergone major\\nchanges as part of the process of liberalization set out in European\\nregulations. In this context of liberalization, railway undertakings compete\\nwith each other for the limited infrastructure capacity available to offer\\ntheir rail services. The infrastructure manager is responsible for the\\nequitable allocation of infrastructure between all companies in the market,\\nwhich is essential to ensure the efficiency and sustainability of this\\ncompetitive ecosystem. In this paper, a methodology based on Jain, Gini and\\nAtkinson equity metrics is used to solve the rail service allocation problem in\\na liberalized railway market, analyzing the solutions obtained. The results\\nshow that the proposed methodology and the equity metrics used allow for\\nequitable planning in different competitiveness scenarios. These results\\ncontrast with solutions where the objective of the infrastructure manager is to\\nmaximize its own profit, without regard for the equitable allocation of\\ninfrastructure. Therefore, the computational tests support the methodology and\\nmetrics used as a planning and decision support tool in a liberalized railway\\nmarket.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NE\", \"categories\": \"cs.NE,cs.CE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T12:30:27Z\"}"}
