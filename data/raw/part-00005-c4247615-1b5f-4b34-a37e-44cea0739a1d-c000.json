For instance, by employing\\nfluorescent probes that exhibit spectra reflective of the surrounding membrane\\nenvironment, one can estimate the membrane polarity. Thus, elucidating how such\\nprobes are dissolved within the membranes would be beneficial for enabling a\\ndeeper interpretation of the spectra. Here, we apply molecular dynamics (MD)\\nsimulation with an enhanced sampling method to investigate the dissolution\\nstate of 6-propionyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene (Prodan) within a membrane\\ncomposed of 1,2-dioleoyl-\\\\textit{sn}-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), as well\\nas its variation upon the addition of ethanol as a cosolvent to the aqueous\\nphase. In the absence of ethanol, it is found that the bulky moieties of Prodan\\n(propionyl and dimethylamine groups) prefer to be oriented toward the membrane\\ncenter owing to the voids existing near the center. The structural change in\\nthe membrane induced by the addition of ethanol causes a reduction in the void\\npopulation near the center, resulting in a diminished orientation preference of\\nProdan.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T08:52:10Z\"}"}
