This tutorial\\narticle aims to provide the foundational knowledge needed to understand,\\ndesign, develop, and improve the dynamic properties of artificial spin ice\\n(ASI). Special emphasis is placed on introducing the theory of micromagnetics,\\nwhich describes the complex dynamics within these systems, along with their\\ndesign, fabrication methods, and standard measurement and control techniques.\\nThe article begins with a review of the historical background, introducing the\\nunderlying physical phenomena and interactions that govern artificial spin ice.\\nWe then explore standard experimental techniques used to prepare the microstate\\nspace of the nanomagnetic array and to characterize magnetization dynamics,\\nboth in artificial spin ice and more broadly in ferromagnetic materials.\\nFinally, we introduce the basics of neuromorphic computing applied to the case\\nof artificial spin ice systems with goal to help researchers new to the field\\ngrasp these exciting new developments.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.dis-nn,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T03:07:07Z\"}"}
