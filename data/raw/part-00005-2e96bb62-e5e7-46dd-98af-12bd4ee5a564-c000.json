The SIM optimization is done via a min-max\\nproblem formulation solved via steepest ascent with closed-form gradients,\\nwhile the RPE is carried out via a compressed sensing-based probabilistic data\\nassociation (PDA) algorithm. Our numerical results indicate that the design of\\nwaveforms suitable to mitigating the effects of DD channels is significantly\\nimpacted by the emerging SIM technology.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T11:36:40Z\"}"}
