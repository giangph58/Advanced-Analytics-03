Particularly, we have bench-marked excitation energies, electric\\ndipole (E1) matrix elements, magnetic dipole hyperfine structure constants\\n($A_{hf}$), and isotope shift (IS) constants in the singly ionized magnesium\\n(Mg$^+$) systematically at different levels of approximation of both methods.\\nWe have also estimated the E1 polarizability of the ground state and lifetimes\\nof the excited states using the E1 matrix elements from both methods. All these\\nresults are compared with the experimental values wherever available. We find\\nthat the computed results agree well with each other with a few exceptions;\\nparticularly the $A_{hf}$ and IS constants from the RCC method are found to\\nagree with the measurements better. This comparison analysis would be useful in\\nevaluating the above-discussed properties in other atomic systems using the\\nMCDHF and RCC methods more reliably.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T06:25:38Z\"}"}
