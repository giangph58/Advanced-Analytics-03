Specifically, dynamic\\nball manipulation in rugged environments presents two key challenges. The first\\nis coordinating distinct motion modalities to integrate terrain traversal and\\nball control seamlessly. The second is overcoming sparse rewards in end-to-end\\ndeep reinforcement learning, which impedes efficient policy convergence. To\\naddress these challenges, we propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning\\nframework. A high-level policy, informed by proprioceptive data and ball\\nposition, adaptively switches between pre-trained low-level skills such as ball\\ndribbling and rough terrain navigation. We further propose Dynamic\\nSkill-Focused Policy Optimization to suppress gradients from inactive skills\\nand enhance critical skill learning. Both simulation and real-world experiments\\nvalidate that our methods outperform baseline approaches in dynamic ball\\nmanipulation across rugged terrains, highlighting its effectiveness in\\nchallenging environments.
