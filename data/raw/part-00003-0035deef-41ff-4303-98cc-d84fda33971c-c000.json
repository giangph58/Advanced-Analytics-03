{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21712v1\", \"title\": \"Presentations, embeddings and automorphisms of homogeneous spaces for\\n  SL(2,C)\", \"summary\": \"For an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic zero and a linear\\nalgebraic $k$-group $G$, it is well known that every affine $G$-variety admits\\na $G$-equivariant closed embedding into a finite-dimensional $G$-module. Such\\nan embedding is a presentation of the $G$-variety, and a minimal presentation\\nis one for which the dimension the $G$-module is minimal. The problem of\\nfinding a minimal presentation generalizes the problem of determining whether a\\ngroup action on affine space is linearizable. We give a minimal presentation\\nfor each homogeneous space for $SL_2(k)$. This constitutes the paper's main\\nwork. Of particular interest are the surfaces $Y=SL_2(k)/T$ and $X=SL_2(k)/N$\\nwhere $T$ is the one-dimensional torus and $N$ is its normalizer. We show that\\nthe minimal presentation of $X$ has dimension 5, the embedding dimension of $X$\\nis 4, and there does not exist a closed $SL_2$-equivariant embedding of $X$ in\\n$A_k^4$. Thus, the $SL_2$-action on $X$ is absolutely nonextendable to $A_k^4$.\\nWe give two other examples of surfaces with absolutely nonextendable group\\nactions. In addition, $X$ is noncancelative, that is, there exists a surface\\n$Z$ such that $X\\\\times A_k^1\\\\cong_k Z\\\\times A_k^1$ and $X\\\\not\\\\cong_kZ$.\\nFinally, we settle the long-standing open question of whether there exist\\ninequivalent closed embeddings of $Y$ in $A_k^3$ by constructing inequivalent\\nembeddings.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:55:13Z\"}"}
