Its remarkable\\ncompactness challenges the standard cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm. In this\\npaper, we explore whether such a compact perturber could be explained as a\\ncore-collapsed halo described by the self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) model.\\nUsing the isothermal Jeans method, we compute the density profiles of\\ncore-collapsed halos across a range of masses. Our comparison with observations\\nindicates that only a core-collapsed halo with a total mass of approximately\\n$10^{11}~{\\\\rm M_{\\\\odot}}$ could produce an inner density profile and mass\\nenclosed within 1 kpc that is consistent with observational data. However, such\\na massive dark matter halo should host a galaxy detectable by prior Hubble\\nimaging, which is not observed. Thus, the core-collapsed SIDM halo model\\nstruggles to fully account for the exotic nature of the \\\"little dark dot\\\" in\\nthe \\\"Jackpot\\\" lens.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T06:16:51Z\"}"}
