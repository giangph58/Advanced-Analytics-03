{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00645v1\", \"title\": \"Generalized Kac-Paljutkin algebras\", \"summary\": \"In this note, we construct a family of semisimple Hopf algebras $H_{n,m}$ of\\ndimension $n^m m!$ over a field of characteristic zero containing a primitive\\n$n$th root of unity, where $n, m \\\\geq 2$ are integers. The well-known\\neight-dimensional Kac--Paljutkin algebra arises as the special case $H_{2,2}$,\\nwhile the Hopf algebras previously constructed by Pansera correspond to the\\ninstances $H_{n,2}$. Each algebra $H_{n,m}$ is defined as an extension of the\\ngroup algebra $\\\\mathbb{K} \\\\Sigma_m$ of the symmetric group by the $m$-fold\\ntensor product $R = \\\\mathbb{K} \\\\mathbb{Z}_n^{\\\\otimes m}$, where $\\\\mathbb{Z}_n$\\ndenotes the cyclic group of order $n$. This extension admits a realization as a\\ncrossed product: $H_{n,m} = \\\\mathbb{K} \\\\mathbb{Z}_n^{\\\\otimes m} \\\\#_\\\\gamma\\n\\\\Sigma_m$. In the final section, we construct a family of irreducible\\n$m$-dimensional representations of $H_{n,m}$ that are inner faithful as\\n$R$-modules and exhibit a nontrivial inner-faithful action of a subalgebra of\\n$H_{n,m}$ on a quantum polynomial algebra.\", \"main_category\": \"math.QA\", \"categories\": \"math.QA,math.RA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T16:35:47Z\"}"}
