{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05921v1\", \"title\": \"Accelerated Reeds-Shepp and Under-Specified Reeds-Shepp Algorithms for\\n  Mobile Robot Path Planning\", \"summary\": \"In this study, we present a simple and intuitive method for accelerating\\noptimal Reeds-Shepp path computation. Our approach uses geometrical reasoning\\nto analyze the behavior of optimal paths, resulting in a new partitioning of\\nthe state space and a further reduction in the minimal set of viable paths. We\\nrevisit and reimplement classic methodologies from the literature, which lack\\ncontemporary open-source implementations, to serve as benchmarks for evaluating\\nour method. Additionally, we address the under-specified Reeds-Shepp planning\\nproblem where the final orientation is unspecified. We perform exhaustive\\nexperiments to validate our solutions. Compared to the modern C++\\nimplementation of the original Reeds-Shepp solution in the Open Motion Planning\\nLibrary, our method demonstrates a 15x speedup, while classic methods achieve a\\n5.79x speedup. Both approaches exhibit machine-precision differences in path\\nlengths compared to the original solution. We release our proposed C++\\nimplementations for both the accelerated and under-specified Reeds-Shepp\\nproblems as open-source code.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.CG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T11:22:50Z\"}"}
