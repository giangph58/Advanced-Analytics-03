The viability of the approach is tested in five\\nexperiments: A target-tracking control strategy, energy-efficient building\\nclimate control, autonomous vehicular dynamics, the simple pendulum, and the\\ncompound pendulum. Three safety guarantees were established for the approach,\\nand the experiments gave the motivation for two important theoretical results\\nthat, in essence, identify systems for which the approach works best.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T15:55:37Z\"}"}
