{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24004v1\", \"title\": \"Multivariate Species Sampling Models\", \"summary\": \"Species sampling processes have long served as the framework for studying\\nrandom discrete distributions. However, their statistical applicability is\\nlimited when partial exchangeability is assumed as probabilistic invariance for\\nthe observables. Despite numerous discrete models for partially exchangeable\\nobservations, a unifying framework is currently missing, leaving many questions\\nabout the induced learning mechanisms unanswered in this setting. To fill this\\ngap, we consider the natural extension of species sampling models to a\\nmultivariate framework, obtaining a general class of models characterized by\\ntheir partially exchangeable partition probability function. A notable\\nsubclass, named regular multivariate species sampling models, exists among\\nthese models. In the subclass, dependence across processes is accurately\\ncaptured by the correlation among them: a correlation of one equals full\\nexchangeability and a null correlation corresponds to independence. Regular\\nmultivariate species sampling models encompass discrete processes for partial\\nexchangeable data used in Bayesian models, thereby highlighting their core\\ndistributional properties and providing a means for developing new models.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.ME,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T12:30:54Z\"}"}
