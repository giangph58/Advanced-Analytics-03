Tur\\\\'{a}n's theorem states that in a simple\\n$K_{r+1}$ free graph, $m \\\\leq \\\\frac{n^2(r-1)}{2r}$. In this paper, we\\ngeneralize this result as follows: For each $v \\\\in V(G)$, let $c(v)$ be the\\norder of the largest clique that contains $v$. We show that \\\\[ m \\\\leq\\n\\\\frac{n}{2}\\\\sum_{v\\\\in V(G)}\\\\frac{c(v)-1}{c(v)}\\\\] Furthermore, we characterize\\nthe class of extremal graphs that attain equality in this bound.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,cs.DM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T17:51:50Z\"}"}
