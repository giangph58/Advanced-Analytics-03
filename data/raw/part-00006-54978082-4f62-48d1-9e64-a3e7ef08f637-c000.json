Specifically, we consider an adversary injecting\\nfalse data into the sensor channels during the learning phase. When the\\noperator seeks to learn a stable state-feedback controller, we propose an\\nattack strategy capable of misleading the operator into learning an unstable\\nfeedback gain. We also investigate the effects of constant-bias injection\\nattacks on data-driven linear quadratic regulation (LQR). Finally, we explore\\npotential mitigation strategies and support our findings with numerical\\nexamples.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T08:08:51Z\"}"}
