The contribution of remote sensing is important for reducing the\\nimpact of flooding both during the event itself and for improving hydrodynamic\\nmodels by reducing their associated uncertainties. This article presents the\\ninnovative capabilities of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT)\\nmission, especially its river node products, to enhance the accuracy of\\nriverine flood reanalysis, performed on a 50-km stretch of the Garonne River.\\nThe experiments incorporate various data assimilation strategies, based on the\\nensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), which allows for sequential updates of model\\nparameters based on available observations. The experimental results show that\\nwhile SWOT data alone offers some improvements, combining it with in-situ water\\nlevel measurements provides the most accurate representation of flood dynamics,\\nboth at gauge stations and along the river. The study also investigates the\\nimpact of different SWOT revisit frequencies on the models performance,\\nrevealing that assimilating more frequent SWOT observations leads to more\\nreliable flood reanalyses. In the real event, it was demonstrated that the\\nassimilation of SWOT and in-situ data accurately reproduces the water level\\ndynamics, offering promising prospects for future flood monitoring systems.\\nOverall, this study emphasizes the complementary strengths of Earth Observation\\ndata in improving the representation of the flood dynamics in the riverbed and\\nthe floodplains.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:10:40Z\"}"}
