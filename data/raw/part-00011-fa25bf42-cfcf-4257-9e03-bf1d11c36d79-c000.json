{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03371v1\", \"title\": \"Learning entanglement from tomography data: contradictory measurement\\n  importance for neural networks and random forests\", \"summary\": \"We study the effectiveness of two distinct machine learning techniques,\\nneural networks and random forests, in the quantification of entanglement from\\ntwo-qubit tomography data. Although we predictably find that neural networks\\nyield better accuracy, we also find that the way that the two methods reach\\ntheir prediction is starkly different. This is seen by the measurements which\\narthe most important for the classification. Neural networks follow the\\nintuitive prediction that measurements containing information about non-local\\ncoherences are most important for entanglement, but random forests signify the\\ndominance of information contained in occupation measurements. This is because\\noccupation measurements are necessary for the extraction of data about all\\nother density matrix elements from the remaining measurements. The same\\ndiscrepancy does not occur when the models are used to learn entanglement\\ndirectly from the elements of the density matrix, so it is the result of the\\nscattering of information and interdependence of measurement data. As a result,\\nthe models behave differently when noise is introduced to various measurements,\\nwhich can be harnessed to obtain more reliable information about entanglement\\nfrom noisy tomography data.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T09:42:35Z\"}"}
