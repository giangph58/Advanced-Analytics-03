{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20992v1\", \"title\": \"Constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity from Quaia\", \"summary\": \"We analyse the large-scale angular clustering of quasars in the Gaia-unWISE\\nquasar catalog, Quaia, and their cross-correlation with maps of the lensing\\nconvergence of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), to constrain the level of\\nprimordial non-Gaussianity (PNG). Specifically, we target the scale-dependent\\nbias that would be induced by PNG on biased tracers of the matter\\ninhomogeneities on large scales. The Quaia sample is particularly well suited\\nfor this analysis, given the large effective volume covered, and our ability to\\nmap out the main potential sources of systematic contamination and mitigate\\ntheir impact. Using the universality relation to characterise the response of\\nthe quasar overdensity to PNG ($p_\\\\phi=1$), we report constraints on the\\nlocal-type PNG parameter $f_{\\\\rm NL}$ of $f_{\\\\rm NL}=-20.5^{+19.0}_{-18.1}$\\n(68\\\\% C.L.) by combining the quasar auto-correlation and its cross-correlation\\nwith CMB lensing in two tomographic redshift bins (or $f_{\\\\rm\\nNL}=-28.7^{+26.1}_{-24.6}$ if assuming a lower response for quasars,\\n$p_\\\\phi=1.6$). Using the CMB lensing cross-correlations alone, we find $f_{\\\\rm\\nNL}=-13.8^{+26.7}_{-25.0}$. These are the tightest constraints on $f_{\\\\rm NL}$\\nto date from angular clustering statistics and cross-correlations with CMB\\nlensing.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:58:04Z\"}"}
