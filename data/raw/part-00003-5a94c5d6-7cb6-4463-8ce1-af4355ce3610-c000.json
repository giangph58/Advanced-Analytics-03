To that end, in this work, we present an\\nimplementation of the Maxwell equations within the adaptive-mesh pseudospectral\\nnumerical relativity code bamps. We present a thorough analysis of the\\nevolution equations as a first order symmetric hyperbolic system of PDEs,\\nincluding the construction of the characteristic variables for use in our\\npenalty boundary communication scheme, and radiation controlling, constraint\\npreserving outer boundary conditions which, in the language of\\nKreiss-Agranovich-M\\\\'etivier, are shown to be boundary-stable. After presenting\\na formulation of the Maxwell constraints that we may solve for initial data, we\\nmove on to present a suite of numerical tests. Our simulations, both within the\\nCowling approximation, and in full non-linear evolution, demonstrate rapid\\nconvergence of error with resolution, as well as consistency with known\\nquasinormal decay rates on the Kerr background. Finally we present evolutions\\nof the electrovacuum equations of motion with strong data, a good\\nrepresentation of typical critical collapse runs.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T11:06:10Z\"}"}
