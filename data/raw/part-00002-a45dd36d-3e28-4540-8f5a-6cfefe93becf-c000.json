Under\\nthis distribution, the measure of a given permutation depends only on its cycle\\nstructure, according to certain weights assigned to each cycle length. The\\nproof is based on uniform control of the characteristic polynomial using\\nresults from the singularity analysis of generating functions, together with\\nthe convergence of traces to explicit random variables expressed via a Poisson\\nfamily. The limit function is the exponential of a Poisson series which has\\nalready appeared in the case of uniform permutation matrices. It is the Poisson\\nanalog of the Gaussian Holomorphic Chaos, related to the limit of\\ncharacteristic polynomials for other matrix models such as Circular Ensembles,\\ni.i.d. matrices, and Gaussian elliptic matrices.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,math.PR,math.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:37:41Z\"}"}
