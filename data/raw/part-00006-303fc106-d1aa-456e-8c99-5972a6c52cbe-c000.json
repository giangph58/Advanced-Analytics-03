{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10041v1\", \"title\": \"Prior Does Matter: Visual Navigation via Denoising Diffusion Bridge\\n  Models\", \"summary\": \"Recent advancements in diffusion-based imitation learning, which show\\nimpressive performance in modeling multimodal distributions and training\\nstability, have led to substantial progress in various robot learning tasks. In\\nvisual navigation, previous diffusion-based policies typically generate action\\nsequences by initiating from denoising Gaussian noise. However, the target\\naction distribution often diverges significantly from Gaussian noise, leading\\nto redundant denoising steps and increased learning complexity. Additionally,\\nthe sparsity of effective action distributions makes it challenging for the\\npolicy to generate accurate actions without guidance. To address these issues,\\nwe propose a novel, unified visual navigation framework leveraging the\\ndenoising diffusion bridge models named NaviBridger. This approach enables\\naction generation by initiating from any informative prior actions, enhancing\\nguidance and efficiency in the denoising process. We explore how diffusion\\nbridges can enhance imitation learning in visual navigation tasks and further\\nexamine three source policies for generating prior actions. Extensive\\nexperiments in both simulated and real-world indoor and outdoor scenarios\\ndemonstrate that NaviBridger accelerates policy inference and outperforms the\\nbaselines in generating target action sequences.
