A 2017\\nresult of Lanzani \\\\& Stein states that the Cauchy--Szeg\\\\\\\"{o} projection\\n$S_\\\\omega$ defined with respect to a bounded, positive continuous multiple\\n$\\\\omega$ of induced Lebesgue measure, {maps $L^p(bD, \\\\omega)$ to $L^p(bD,\\n\\\\omega)$ continuously} for any $1<p<\\\\infty$. Here we show that $S_\\\\omega$\\nsatisfies explicit quantitative bounds in $L^p(bD, \\\\Omega)$, for any\\n$1<p<\\\\infty$ and for any $\\\\Omega$ in the maximal class of\\n\\\\textit{$A_p$}-measures, that is for $\\\\Omega_p = \\\\psi_p\\\\sigma$ where $\\\\psi_p$\\nis a Muckenhoupt $A_p$-weight and $\\\\sigma$ is the induced Lebesgue measure\\n(with $\\\\omega$'s as above being a sub-class). Earlier results rely upon an\\nasymptotic expansion and subsequent pointwise estimates of the Cauchy--Szeg\\\\\\\"o\\nkernel, but these are unavailable in our setting of minimal regularity {of\\n$bD$}; at the same time, more recent techniques that allow to handle domains\\nwith minimal regularity (Lanzani--Stein 2017) are not applicable to\\n$A_p$-measures. It turns out that the method of {quantitative} extrapolation is\\nan appropriate replacement for the missing tools. To finish, we identify a\\nclass of holomorphic Hardy spaces defined with respect to $A_p$-measures for\\nwhich a meaningful notion of Cauchy--Szeg\\\\\\\"o projection can be defined when\\n$p=2$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CV\", \"categories\": \"math.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:34:20Z\"}"}
