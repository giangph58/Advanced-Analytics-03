Using an adequate coupling, we are able to prove the\\nstrong convergence, for the uniform topology, to a piecewise deterministic\\nMarkov process. Under some additional regularity, we also obtain a central\\nlimit theorem and prove that the fluctuations of the continuous scale converge,\\nin a weaker sense, to the solution of a stochastic differential equation.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T06:46:30Z\"}"}
