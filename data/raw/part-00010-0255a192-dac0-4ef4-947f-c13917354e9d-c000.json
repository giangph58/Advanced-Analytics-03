Here, we report some novel stable non-van\\nder Waals Nb$_x$N$_{x+1}$ ($x$ = 1-4) monolayers derived from the NbN bulk\\nexfoliated along the (001) plane, as identified through first-principles\\ncalculations. Among these monolayers, Nb$_2$N$_3$, which crystallizes in the $P\\n\\\\overline{6} m2$ symmetry, stands out with an exceptional superconducting\\ntransition temperature of 77.8 K, setting a new high-$T_c$ benchmark for\\ntwo-dimensional transition metal nitrides and binary compounds. Our detailed\\nanalysis reveals that the strong superconductivity in Nb$_2$N$_3$ is driven by\\nphonon modes dominated by N vibrations, with significant electron-phonon\\ncoupling contributions from N-$p$ and Nb-$d$ electronic states. Using the\\nanisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg framework, we further determine the two-gap\\nnature of the superconductivity in the Nb$_2$N$_3$ monolayer, characterized by\\npronounced electron-phonon coupling and anisotropic energy gaps. These results\\nadvance our understanding of superconductivity in 2D transition metal nitride\\nand highlight their potential for nanoscale superconducting applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T15:42:51Z\"}"}
