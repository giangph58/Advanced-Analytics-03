{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10986v1\", \"title\": \"PraNet-V2: Dual-Supervised Reverse Attention for Medical Image\\n  Segmentation\", \"summary\": \"Accurate medical image segmentation is essential for effective diagnosis and\\ntreatment. Previously, PraNet-V1 was proposed to enhance polyp segmentation by\\nintroducing a reverse attention (RA) module that utilizes background\\ninformation. However, PraNet-V1 struggles with multi-class segmentation tasks.\\nTo address this limitation, we propose PraNet-V2, which, compared to PraNet-V1,\\neffectively performs a broader range of tasks including multi-class\\nsegmentation. At the core of PraNet-V2 is the Dual-Supervised Reverse Attention\\n(DSRA) module, which incorporates explicit background supervision, independent\\nbackground modeling, and semantically enriched attention fusion. Our PraNet-V2\\nframework demonstrates strong performance on four polyp segmentation datasets.\\nAdditionally, by integrating DSRA to iteratively enhance foreground\\nsegmentation results in three state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models, we\\nachieve up to a 1.36% improvement in mean Dice score.
