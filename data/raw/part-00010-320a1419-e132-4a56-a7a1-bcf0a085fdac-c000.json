In this setting, many interesting question remain on\\nthe properties of hereditary dependent (NIP) classes of graphs, in particular\\nrelated to first-order transductions.\\n  Motivated by Simon's decomposition theorem of dependent types into a stable\\npart and a distal (order-like) part, we conjecture that every hereditary\\ndependent class of graphs is transduction-equivalent to a hereditary dependent\\nclass of partially ordered graphs, where the cover graph of the partial order\\nhas bounded treewidth and the unordered graph is (edge) stable.\\n  In this paper, we consider the first non-trivial case (classes with bounded\\nlinear cliquewidth) and prove that the conjecture holds in a strong form, where\\nthe cover graph of the partial order has bounded pathwidth. Then, we extend our\\nstudy to classes that admit bounded-size bounded linear cliquewidth covers, and\\nprove that the conjecture holds for these classes, too.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,cs.LO,math.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T15:27:27Z\"}"}
