In\\nthis work, we investigate three novel approaches to enhance RT-DETR robustness\\nin foggy environments: (1) Domain Adaptation via Perceptual Loss, which\\ndistills domain-invariant features from a teacher network to a student using\\nperceptual supervision; (2) Weather Adaptive Attention, which augments the\\nattention mechanism with fog-sensitive scaling by introducing an auxiliary\\nfoggy image stream; and (3) Weather Fusion Encoder, which integrates a\\ndual-stream encoder architecture that fuses clear and foggy image features via\\nmulti-head self and cross-attention. Despite the architectural innovations,\\nnone of the proposed methods consistently outperform the baseline RT-DETR. We\\nanalyze the limitations and potential causes, offering insights for future\\nresearch in weather-aware object detection.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T05:11:18Z\"}"}
