Leveraging our previously reported high-speed, high-sensitivity\\natomic-based THz imager, we achieve a resolution enhancement of 74(3)% at 0.55\\nTHz, without the aid of deconvolution methods. We show a high-speed THz imaging\\nsystem is compatible with the use of advanced optical techniques, with\\npotential disruptive effects on applications requiring both high speed and high\\nspatial resolution imaging in the THz range.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T13:54:33Z\"}"}
