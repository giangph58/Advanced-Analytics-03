In this context, the light-matter hybridization in optical\\ncavities can lead to intriguing effects, such as modified carrier transport,\\nenhancement of optical quantum yield, and control of chemical reaction\\npathways. Here, we investigate the impact of the strong light-matter coupling\\nregime on energy conversion, both in relaxation and upconversion schemes, by\\nutilizing a strongly charged MoSe2 monolayer embedded in a spectrally tunable\\nopen-access cavity. We find that the charge carrier gas yields a significantly\\nmodified photoluminescence response of cavity exciton-polaritons, dominated by\\nan intra-cavity like pump scheme. In addition, upconversion luminescence\\nemerges from a population transfer from fermionic trions to bosonic\\nexciton-polaritons. Due to the availability of multiple optical modes in the\\ntunable open cavity, it seamlessly meets the cavity-enhanced double resonance\\ncondition required for an efficient upconversion. The latter can be actively\\ntuned via the cavity length in-situ, displaying nonlinear scaling in intensity\\nand fingerprints of the valley polarization. This suggests mechanisms that\\ninclude both trion-trion Auger scattering and phonon absorption as its\\nunderlying microscopic origin.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T08:21:42Z\"}"}
