{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04939v1\", \"title\": \"A Taxonomy of Self-Handover\", \"summary\": \"Self-handover, transferring an object between one's own hands, is a common\\nbut understudied bimanual action. While it facilitates seamless transitions in\\ncomplex tasks, the strategies underlying its execution remain largely\\nunexplored. Here, we introduce the first systematic taxonomy of self-handover,\\nderived from manual annotation of over 12 hours of cooking activity performed\\nby 21 participants. Our analysis reveals that self-handover is not merely a\\npassive transition, but a highly coordinated action involving anticipatory\\nadjustments by both hands. As a step toward automated analysis of human\\nmanipulation, we further demonstrate the feasibility of classifying\\nself-handover types using a state-of-the-art vision-language model. These\\nfindings offer fresh insights into bimanual coordination, underscoring the role\\nof self-handover in enabling smooth task transitions-an ability essential for\\nadaptive dual-arm robotics.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:21:42Z\"}"}
