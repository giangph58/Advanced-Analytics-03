The proposed design aims to improve processing speed and reduce\\ncomputational latency. Through experiments, we validate the performance\\nbenefits of the hardware accelerator and show how well it handles FFT and SVD\\noperations. With its strong security and durability, the accelerator design\\nachieves significant speedups over software implementations, thanks to its\\nmodules for data flow control, watermark embedding, FFT, and SVD.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AR\", \"categories\": \"cs.AR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:58:46Z\"}"}
