{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10460v1\", \"title\": \"Target Pebbling in Trees\", \"summary\": \"Graph pebbling is a game played on graphs with pebbles on their vertices. A\\npebbling move removes two pebbles from one vertex and places one pebble on an\\nadjacent vertex. A configuration $C$ is a supply of pebbles at various vertices\\nof a graph $G$, and a distribution $D$ is a demand of pebbles at various\\nvertices of $G$. The $D$-pebbling number, $\\\\pi(G, D)$, of a graph $G$ is\\ndefined to be the minimum number $m$ such that every configuration of $m$\\npebbles can satisfy the demand $D$ via pebbling moves. The special case in\\nwhich $t$ pebbles are demanded on vertex $v$ is denoted $D=v^t$, and the\\n$t$-fold pebbling number, $\\\\pi_{t}(G)$, equals $\\\\max_{v\\\\in G}\\\\pi(G,v^t)$. It\\nwas conjectured by Alc\\\\'on, Gutierrez, and Hurlbert that the pebbling numbers\\nof chordal graphs forbidding the pyramid graph can be calculated in polynomial\\ntime. Trees, of course, are the most prominent of such graphs. In 1989, Chung\\ndetermined $\\\\pi_t(T)$ for all trees $T$. In this paper, we provide a\\npolynomial-time algorithm to compute the pebbling numbers $\\\\pi(T,D)$ for all\\ndistributions $D$ on any tree $T$, and characterize maximum-size configurations\\nthat do not satisfy $D$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:46:17Z\"}"}
