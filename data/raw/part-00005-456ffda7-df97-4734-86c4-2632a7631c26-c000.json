{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16800v1\", \"title\": \"Array Partitioning Based Near-Field Attitude and Location Estimation\", \"summary\": \"This paper studies a passive source localization system, where a single base\\nstation (BS) is employed to estimate the positions and attitudes of multiple\\nmobile stations (MSs). The BS and the MSs are equipped with uniform rectangular\\narrays, and the MSs are located in the near-field region of the BS array. To\\navoid the difficulty of tackling the problem directly based on the near-field\\nsignal model, we establish a subarray-wise far-field received signal model. In\\nthis model, the entire BS array is divided into multiple subarrays to ensure\\nthat each MS is in the far-field region of each BS subarray. By exploiting the\\nangles of arrival (AoAs) of an MS antenna at different BS subarrays, we\\nformulate the attitude and location estimation problem under the Bayesian\\ninference framework. Based on the factor graph representation of the\\nprobabilistic problem model, a message passing algorithm named array\\npartitioning based pose and location estimation (APPLE) is developed to solve\\nthis problem. An estimation-error lower bound is obtained as a performance\\nbenchmark of the proposed algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the\\nproposed APPLE algorithm outperforms other baseline methods in the accuracy of\\nposition and attitude estimation.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:20:39Z\"}"}
