This\\nis a practical and applicable problem in clinics and hospitals, as WSIs are\\nlarge, require storage, processing, and transfer time. Training new models\\nwhenever new tasks are defined is time-consuming. Recent work has applied\\nregularization- and rehearsal-based methods to this setting. However, the rise\\nof vision-language foundation models that align diagnostic text with pathology\\nimages raises the question: are these models alone sufficient for lifelong WSI\\nlearning using zero-shot classification, or is further investigation into\\ncontinual learning strategies needed to improve performance? To our knowledge,\\nthis is the first study to compare conventional continual-learning approaches\\nwith vision-language zero-shot classification for WSIs. Our source code and\\nexperimental results will be available soon.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T06:38:37Z\"}"}
