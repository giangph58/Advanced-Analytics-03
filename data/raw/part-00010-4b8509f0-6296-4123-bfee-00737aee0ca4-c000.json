So far,\\nhowever, no embedded OS in Rust supports multicore preemptive scheduling on\\nmicrocontrollers. In this paper, we thus fill this gap with a new operating\\nsystem: Ariel OS. We describe its design, we provide the source code of its\\nimplementation, and we perform micro-benchmarks on the main 32-bit\\nmicrocontroller architectures: ARM Cortex-M, RISC-V and Espressif Xtensa. We\\nshow how our scheduler takes advantage of several cores, while incurring only\\nsmall overhead on single-core hardware. As such, Ariel OS provides a convenient\\nembedded software platform for small networked devices, for both research and\\nindustry practitioners.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.OS\", \"categories\": \"cs.OS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T10:21:13Z\"}"}
