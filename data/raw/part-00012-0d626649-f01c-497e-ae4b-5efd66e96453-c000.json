{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04150v1\", \"title\": \"Learning from Similarity Proportion Loss for Classifying Skeletal Muscle\\n  Recovery Stages\", \"summary\": \"Evaluating the regeneration process of damaged muscle tissue is a fundamental\\nanalysis in muscle research to measure experimental effect sizes and uncover\\nmechanisms behind muscle weakness due to aging and disease. The conventional\\napproach to assessing muscle tissue regeneration involves whole-slide imaging\\nand expert visual inspection of the recovery stages based on the morphological\\ninformation of cells and fibers. There is a need to replace these tasks with\\nautomated methods incorporating machine learning techniques to ensure a\\nquantitative and objective analysis. Given the limited availability of fully\\nlabeled data, a possible approach is Learning from Label Proportions (LLP), a\\nweakly supervised learning method using class label proportions. However,\\ncurrent LLP methods have two limitations: (1) they cannot adapt the feature\\nextractor for muscle tissues, and (2) they treat the classes representing\\nrecovery stages and cell morphological changes as nominal, resulting in the\\nloss of ordinal information. To address these issues, we propose Ordinal Scale\\nLearning from Similarity Proportion (OSLSP), which uses a similarity proportion\\nloss derived from two bag combinations. OSLSP can update the feature extractor\\nby using class proportion attention to the ordinal scale of the class. Our\\nmodel with OSLSP outperforms large-scale pre-trained and fine-tuning models in\\nclassification tasks of skeletal muscle recovery stages.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T06:02:27Z\"}"}
