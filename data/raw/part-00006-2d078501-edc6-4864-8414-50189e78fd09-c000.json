Using\\nnumerical simulations for the future experiment DUNE, we find that the\\nstatistical significance for excluding the incorrect mass ordering can be\\nenhanced by $1.0\\\\sigma$--$1.2\\\\sigma$ if a one-loop correction of $5.8\\\\%$ --\\npredicted by the Standard Model in the on-shell renormalization scheme -- is\\nincluded. Even with a smaller correction of $2.0\\\\%$, based instead on the Fermi\\ncoupling constant $G^{}_\\\\mu$ derived from measurements of muon lifetime, we\\nshow that the enhancement remains notable at about $0.4\\\\sigma$. In contrast,\\nthe sensitivity to leptonic CP violation in DUNE is essentially unchanged.\\nFinally, we emphasize that one-loop corrections should be incorporated into\\nanalyses of future neutrino oscillation data in a consistent and systematic\\nmanner.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T16:03:43Z\"}"}
