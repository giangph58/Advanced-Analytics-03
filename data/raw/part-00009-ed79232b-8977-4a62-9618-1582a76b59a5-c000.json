We provide sufficient\\nconditions inspired by [6,63] to prove that at small scales, in the presence of\\nthe Coriolis force, the so-called third-order structure function's asymptotics\\nfollows the third-order universal law of 2D turbulence without the Coriolis\\nforce. Our result indicates that at small scales, the enstrophy flux from\\nlarger to smaller scales is not affected by the Coriolis force, confirming\\nexperimental and numerical observations. To the best of our knowledge, this is\\nthe first mathematically rigorous study of the above equations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T13:38:32Z\"}"}
