{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16065v1\", \"title\": \"A Mysterious Connection Between Tolerant Junta Testing and Agnostically\\n  Learning Conjunctions\", \"summary\": \"The main conceptual contribution of this paper is identifying a previously\\nunnoticed connection between two central problems in computational learning\\ntheory and property testing: agnostically learning conjunctions and tolerantly\\ntesting juntas. Inspired by this connection, the main technical contribution is\\na pair of improved algorithms for these two problems.\\n  In more detail,\\n  - We give a distribution-free algorithm for agnostically PAC learning\\nconjunctions over $\\\\{\\\\pm 1\\\\}^n$ that runs in time $2^{\\\\widetilde{O}(n^{1/3})}$,\\nfor constant excess error $\\\\varepsilon$. This improves on the fastest\\npreviously published algorithm, which runs in time $2^{\\\\widetilde{O}(n^{1/2})}$\\n[KKMS08].\\n  - Building on the ideas in our agnostic conjunction learner and using\\nsignificant additional technical ingredients, we give an adaptive tolerant\\ntesting algorithm for $k$-juntas that makes $2^{\\\\widetilde{O}(k^{1/3})}$\\nqueries, for constant \\\"gap parameter\\\" $\\\\varepsilon$ between the \\\"near\\\" and\\n\\\"far\\\" cases. This improves on the best previous results, due to [ITW21, NP24],\\nwhich make $2^{\\\\widetilde{O}(\\\\sqrt{k})}$ queries. Since there is a known\\n$2^{\\\\widetilde{\\\\Omega}(\\\\sqrt{k})}$ lower bound for non-adaptive tolerant junta\\ntesters, our result shows that adaptive tolerant junta testing algorithms\\nprovably outperform non-adaptive ones.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T17:42:52Z\"}"}
