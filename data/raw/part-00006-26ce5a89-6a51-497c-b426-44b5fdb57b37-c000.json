The system of fluids is\\nconsidered at distinct temperatures to elucidate the effect of the degree of\\nmiscibility between the two fluids. We employ a modified phase- field model to\\ntrack the evolution of the RBM instability as the temperature of the system is\\nvaried. The proposed model correctly initializes the concentration profile and\\nalso properly leads to a miscibility-dependent surface tension. A\\nspectral-collocation-based method is employed to solve the linearized governing\\nequations that help investigate the onset characteristics of the convection,\\ni.e., both the critical values and the mode of convection onset, which could be\\neither oscillatory or stationary. The results reveal the dependence of the\\nwindow of oscillatory convection on the degree of miscibility between the two\\nfluids. The coupling between the Korteweg stresses and the degree of\\nmiscibility governs the thermal energy required to provoke the system into the\\nconvective state. The onset of RBM flow is analyzed parametrically, with the\\nsuccessive rise in the strength of the Marangoni component.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T15:33:27Z\"}"}
