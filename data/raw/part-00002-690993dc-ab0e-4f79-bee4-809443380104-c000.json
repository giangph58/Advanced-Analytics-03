The model consists of\\nthe equation for conservation mass and dependencies for porosity, permeability,\\nand oil density on pressure. The oil viscosity is considered to be the\\nexperimentally expired parabolic relationship on pressure. To close the model,\\ntwo types of Darcy law are used: the classic one and the dynamic one describing\\nthe relaxation processes during filtration. In the former case, self-similar\\nsolutions are studied, while in the latter case, traveling wave solutions are\\nthe focus. Using the invariant solutions, the initial model is reduced to the\\nnonlinear ordinary differential equations possessing the trajectories vanishing\\nat infinity and representing the moving liquid fronts in porous media. To\\napproximate these solutions, we elaborate the semi-analytic procedure based on\\nmodified Pade approximants. In fact, we calculate sequentially Pade\\napproximants up to 3d order for a two-point boundary value problem on the\\nsemi-infinite domain. A good agreement of evaluated Pade approximants and\\nnumerical solutions is observed. The approach provides relatively simple\\nquasi-rational expressions of solutions and can be easily adapted for other\\ntypes of model's nonlinearity.\", \"main_category\": \"math-ph\", \"categories\": \"math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T16:05:46Z\"}"}
