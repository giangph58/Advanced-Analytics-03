{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12648v1\", \"title\": \"Enantiospecific Two-Photon Electric-Dipole Selection Rules of Chiral\\n  Molecules\", \"summary\": \"Distinguishing between enantiomers is crucial in the study of chiral\\nmolecules in chemistry and pharmacology. Many optical approaches rely on\\nenantiospecific cyclic electric-dipole transitions induced by three microwave\\nor laser beams. However, these approaches impose stringent requirements,\\nincluding phase locking, three-photon resonance, and precise control over beam\\nintensities and operation times, which enhance the complexity and restrict the\\napplicability. In this letter, we present a novel optical method that {\\\\it\\neliminates these constraints entirely.} Specifically, we demonstrate that in\\nthe presence of a static electric field, the selection rules for two-photon\\nelectric-dipole transitions differ between enantiomers. This distinction arises\\nbecause the static electric field breaks the symmetry associated with the\\ncombined action of a specific rotation and time-reversal transformation.\\nLeveraging the enantiospecific two-photon selection rule, one can selectively\\nexcite a desired enantiomer using only two beams, without the need for phase\\nlocking, resonance condition, and the precise control of their intensities and\\noperation times. Our method significantly enhances the feasibility and\\napplicability of optical approaches for enantiomer differentiation.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T05:19:03Z\"}"}
