{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02361v1\", \"title\": \"MG-Gen: Single Image to Motion Graphics Generation with Layer\\n  Decomposition\", \"summary\": \"General image-to-video generation methods often produce suboptimal animations\\nthat do not meet the requirements of animated graphics, as they lack active\\ntext motion and exhibit object distortion. Also, code-based animation\\ngeneration methods typically require layer-structured vector data which are\\noften not readily available for motion graphic generation. To address these\\nchallenges, we propose a novel framework named MG-Gen that reconstructs data in\\nvector format from a single raster image to extend the capabilities of\\ncode-based methods to enable motion graphics generation from a raster image in\\nthe framework of general image-to-video generation. MG-Gen first decomposes the\\ninput image into layer-wise elements, reconstructs them as HTML format data and\\nthen generates executable JavaScript code for the reconstructed HTML data. We\\nexperimentally confirm that \\\\ours{} generates motion graphics while preserving\\ntext readability and input consistency. These successful results indicate that\\ncombining layer decomposition and animation code generation is an effective\\nstrategy for motion graphics generation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GR\", \"categories\": \"cs.GR,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T07:52:12Z\"}"}
