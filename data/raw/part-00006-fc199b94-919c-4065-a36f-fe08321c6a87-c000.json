The key challenge is that\\nglobally hyperbolic Lorentzian bordisms between two Cauchy surfaces cannot\\nchange the topology of the Cauchy surface. This is addressed and solved by\\nintroducing a more flexible concept of bordisms which provide morphisms from\\ntuples of causally disjoint partial Cauchy surfaces to a later-in-time full\\nCauchy surface. They assemble into a globally hyperbolic Lorentzian bordism\\npseudo-operad, generalizing the geometric bordism pseudo-categories of Stolz\\nand Teichner. The associated FQFTs are defined as pseudo-multifunctors into a\\nsymmetric monoidal category of unital associative algebras. The main result of\\nthis paper is an equivalence theorem between such globally hyperbolic\\nLorentzian FQFTs and algebraic quantum field theories (AQFTs), both subject to\\nthe time-slice axiom and a mild descent condition called additivity.\", \"main_category\": \"math-ph\", \"categories\": \"math-ph,hep-th,math.DG,math.MP,math.QA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T10:11:48Z\"}"}
