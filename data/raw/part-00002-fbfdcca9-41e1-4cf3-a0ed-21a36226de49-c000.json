Under a highly elliptic microwave field,\\nfew-molecule scatterings in three dimension are shown to be governed by\\neffective one-dimensional (1D) models. These models well reproduce the\\ntetratomic (two-molecule) bound state and the Born-Oppenheimer potential in\\nthree-molecule sector. For hexatomic systems comprising three identical\\nmolecules, we find the lowest bound state emerge concurrently with tetratomic\\nstate, with binding energy exceeding twice of the latter. Strikingly, all these\\nbound states display Bose-Fermi duality, i.e., they share identical energies\\nand spatial densities in both bosonic and fermionic molecular systems.\\nUniversal features of these bound states are supported by the 1D nature of\\neffective scattering and a large repulsive core in the reduced effective\\npotential. For large molecule ensembles, our results suggest the formation of\\nelongated self-bound droplets with crystalline patterns in both bosonic and\\nfermionic polar molecules.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T11:32:42Z\"}"}
