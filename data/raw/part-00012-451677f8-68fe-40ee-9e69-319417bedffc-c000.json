While current\\npharmacological treatments aim to slow disease progression, they remain\\ninsufficient in halting cognitive decline. Mathematical modeling has emerged as\\na powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of AD and optimizing treatment\\nstrategies. However, most existing models focus on temporal dynamics using\\nordinary differential equation-based approaches, often neglecting the critical\\nrole of spatial heterogeneity in disease progression.\\n  In this study, we employ a spatially explicit reaction-diffusion model to\\ndescribe amyloid-beta (A beta) dynamics in the brain, incorporating treatment\\noptimization while accounting for potential side effects. Our objective is to\\nminimize amyloid-beta plaque concentration while balancing therapeutic efficacy\\nagainst adverse effects, such as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA).\\nUnder specific assumptions, we establish the well-posedness and uniqueness of\\nthe optimal solution. We employ numerical methods based on the Finite Element\\nMethod to compute personalized treatment strategies, leveraging real patient\\namyloid-beta positron emission tomography (PET) scan data.\\n  Our results demonstrate that optimal treatment strategies outperform constant\\ndosing regimens, achieving significant reductions in amyloid burden while\\nminimizing side effects. By integrating spatial dynamics and personalized\\ntreatment planning, our framework offers a novel approach to refining\\ntherapeutic interventions for Alzheimer's disease.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:22:09Z\"}"}
