The algorithm has a mathematical\\ndescription and circuit implementation on a quantum processor. The idea is to\\nmake a quick decision (down to a single iteration) based on the correspondence\\nbetween the data and the desired result, with a probability proportionate to\\nthis correspondence. Our approach allows one to calibrate the circuit to\\ncontrol specified proportions.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T11:53:14Z\"}"}
