Our focus\\nis on memristive systems as they appear in neurophysiology and neuromorphic\\nsystems. Revisiting the original definition of Chua, we regard memristive\\nelements as gradient operators of quadratic functionals with respect to a\\nmetric determined by the memristance. We explore the consequences of gradient\\nproperties for the analysis and design of neuromorphic circuits.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY,math.DG,math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T10:56:51Z\"}"}
