Our goal is to design the UAV topology, trajectory, and\\nprecoding to maximize the system channel capacity. To this end, we convert the\\noriginal problem into equivalent two-stage problems. Specifically, we first try\\nto maximize the channel gain by meticulously designing the UAV topology. We\\nthen study the joint optimization of the trajectory and precoding for total\\ntransmit power minimization while satisfying the constraints on providing\\nquality of service (QoS) assurance to the BS, the leakage tolerance to Eves,\\nthe per-UAV transmit power, the initial/final locations, and the cylindrical\\nno-fly zones. For the UAV topology design, we prove that the topology follows\\nthe Fekete-point distribution. The design of trajectory and precoding is\\nformulated as a non-convex optimization problem which is generally intractable.\\nSubsequently, the non-convex constraints are converted into convex terms, and a\\ndouble-loop search algorithm is proposed to solve the transmit power\\nminimization problem. Introduce random rotation offsets so as to perform a\\ndynamic stochastic channel to enhance the security. Numerical results\\ndemonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in promoting capacity.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T03:39:02Z\"}"}
