{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15690v1\", \"title\": \"A Data Literacy Competence Model for Higher Education and Research\", \"summary\": \"In an increasingly data-driven world, the ability to understand, interpret,\\nand use data - data literacy - is emerging as a critical competence across all\\nacademic disciplines. The Data Literacy Initiative (DaLI) at TH K\\\\\\\"oln\\naddresses this need by developing a comprehensive competence model for\\npromoting data literacy in higher education. Based on interdisciplinary\\ncollaboration and empirical research, the DaLI model defines seven overarching\\ncompetence areas: \\\"Establish Data Culture\\\", \\\"Provide Data\\\", \\\"Manage Data\\\",\\n\\\"Analyze Data\\\", \\\"Evaluate Data\\\", \\\"Interpret Data\\\", and \\\"Publish Data\\\". Each\\narea is further detailed by specific competence dimensions and progression\\nlevels, providing a structured framework for curriculum design, teaching, and\\nassessment. Intended for use across disciplines, the model supports the\\nstrategic integration of data literacy into university programs. By providing a\\ncommon language and orientation for educators and institutions, the DaLI model\\ncontributes to the broader goal of preparing students to navigate and shape a\\ndata-informed society.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T08:14:23Z\"}"}
