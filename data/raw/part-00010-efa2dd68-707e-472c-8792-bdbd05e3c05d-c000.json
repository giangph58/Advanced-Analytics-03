Extracting the most\\npertinent context from such data is critical for exploiting its true potential\\ntoward optimal and timely decision-making in patient care. While prior research\\nhas explored various methods for clinical text summarization, most prior\\nstudies either process all input tokens uniformly or rely on heuristic-based\\nfilters, which can overlook nuanced clinical cues and fail to prioritize\\ninformation critical for decision-making. In this study, we propose Contextual,\\na novel framework that integrates a Context-Preserving Token Filtering method\\nwith a Domain-Specific Knowledge Graph (KG) for contextual augmentation. By\\npreserving context-specific important tokens and enriching them with structured\\nknowledge, ConTextual improves both linguistic coherence and clinical fidelity.\\nOur extensive empirical evaluations on two public benchmark datasets\\ndemonstrate that ConTextual consistently outperforms other baselines. Our\\nproposed approach highlights the complementary role of token-level filtering\\nand structured retrieval in enhancing both linguistic and clinical integrity,\\nas well as offering a scalable solution for improving precision in clinical\\ntext generation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T03:42:46Z\"}"}
