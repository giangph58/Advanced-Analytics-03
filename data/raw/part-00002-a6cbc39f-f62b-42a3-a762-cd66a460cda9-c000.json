{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12758v1\", \"title\": \"Universal Approximation with XL MIMO Systems: OTA Classification via\\n  Trainable Analog Combining\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we demonstrate that an eXtremely Large (XL) Multiple-Input\\nMultiple-Output (MIMO) wireless system with appropriate analog combining\\ncomponents exhibits the properties of a universal function approximator,\\nsimilar to a feedforward neural network. By treating the XL MIMO channel\\ncoefficients as the random nodes of a hidden layer, and the receiver's analog\\ncombiner as a trainable output layer, we cast the end-to-end system to the\\nExtreme Learning Machine (ELM) framework, leading to a novel formulation for\\nOver-The-Air (OTA) edge inference without requiring traditional digital\\nprocessing nor pre-processing at the transmitter. Through theoretical analysis\\nand numerical evaluation, we showcase that XL-MIMO-ELM enables\\nnear-instantaneous training and efficient classification, suggesting the\\nparadigm shift of beyond massive MIMO systems as neural networks alongside\\ntheir profound communications role. Compared to deep learning approaches and\\nconventional ELMs, the proposed framework achieves on par performance with\\norders of magnitude lower complexity, making it highly attractive for ultra low\\npower wireless devices.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T08:53:30Z\"}"}
