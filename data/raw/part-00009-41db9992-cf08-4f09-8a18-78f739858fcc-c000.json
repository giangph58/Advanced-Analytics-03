{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05442v1\", \"title\": \"Density modulated star formation efficiency: implications for the\\n  observed abundance of ultra-violet luminous galaxies at z>10\", \"summary\": \"The number density of UV luminous galaxies discovered by the James Webb Space\\nTelescope at ultra high redshift ($z \\\\gtrsim 10$) is higher, and declines much\\nmore slowly with increasing redshift, than expected from extrapolations of\\nlower redshift observations or pre-launch physics-based models. Most of these\\nmodels assume star formation efficiencies (SFE) of only a few percent,\\nmotivated by observations of nearby galaxies. In this work, we incorporate a\\nscaling of SFE with gas surface density (which we refer to as Density Modulated\\nSFE; DMSFE), motivated by cloud-scale simulations and theory, into a\\nsemi-analytic cosmological model (SAM) of galaxy formation which is calibrated\\nto match the observed rest-UV sizes of high redshift galaxies. We also model\\nthe impact of dust and bursty star formation on the SAM-predicted properties of\\nobserved galaxies. We show that with plausible values of the main parameters,\\nsuch as the fraction of gas in dense clouds $f_{\\\\rm dense}$, our new models\\neasily reproduce or even exceed the observed galaxy number densities at $z\\\\sim\\n6$-17. While no single value of $f_{\\\\rm dense}$ is able to reproduce the very\\nshallow observed decline of the galaxy number density at $z\\\\gtrsim 12$, it is\\nplausible and even expected for $f_{\\\\rm dense}$ to have some effective\\ndependence on cosmic time, which could bring these models into closer agreement\\nwith the data. We show that the combined effects of DMSFE, decreasing dust\\nattenuation, and increasingly bursty star formation at earlier cosmic epochs\\ncould conspire to reproduce the observed evolution.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T17:31:45Z\"}"}
