We\\nfurther develop and analyse a covariantized version of the Anderson-York\\nequations, which provide a well posed system of tensorial evolution equations\\nwith freely prescribable shift vector and densitised lapse. The causality\\nproperties of the resulting equations are explored. We show how to relate\\nsolutions of the Anderson-York equations to the maximal globally hyperbolic\\ndevelopment of the initial data.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T13:26:34Z\"}"}
