However, aporophobia -- the societal bias against people\\nliving in poverty -- constitutes a major obstacle to designing, approving and\\nimplementing poverty-mitigation policies. This work presents an initial step\\ntowards operationalizing the concept of aporophobia to identify and track\\nharmful beliefs and discriminative actions against poor people on social media.\\nIn close collaboration with non-profits and governmental organizations, we\\nconduct data collection and exploration. Then we manually annotate a corpus of\\nEnglish tweets from five world regions for the presence of (1) direct\\nexpressions of aporophobia, and (2) statements referring to or criticizing\\naporophobic views or actions of others, to comprehensively characterize the\\nsocial media discourse related to bias and discrimination against the poor.\\nBased on the annotated data, we devise a taxonomy of categories of aporophobic\\nattitudes and actions expressed through speech on social media. Finally, we\\ntrain several classifiers and identify the main challenges for automatic\\ndetection of aporophobia in social networks. This work paves the way towards\\nidentifying, tracking, and mitigating aporophobic views on social media at\\nscale.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY,cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T16:53:14Z\"}"}
