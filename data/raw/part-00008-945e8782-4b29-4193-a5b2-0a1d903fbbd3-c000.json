Without invoking field equations of a particular\\ngravitational theory, we develop visualization techniques for such torsion\\nfields, consider a generalization of Killing vectors to the presence of\\ntorsion, and find explicit representations of such Killing vectors (and their\\ngeneralized algebra) in the presence of constant torsion. We then utilize these\\nstructures to derive general properties of surface gravities of static black\\nholes whose near-horizon region features approximately constant torsion fields.\\nUnder certain assumptions, the two-dimensional results can be lifted to four\\ndimensions.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:18:48Z\"}"}
