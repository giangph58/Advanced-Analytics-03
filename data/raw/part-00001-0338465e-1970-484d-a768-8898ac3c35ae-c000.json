In this work,\\nwe implement an efficient entropy sampling scheme for accurate computation of\\nthe entropy function in low-energy regions. The method is applied to the\\ntwo-dimensional $\\\\pm J$ random-bond Ising model, where frustration is\\ncontrolled by the fraction $p$ of ferromagnetic bonds. We investigate the\\nlow-temperature paramagnetic--ferromagnetic phase boundary below the\\nmulticritical point at $T_N = 0.9530(4)$, $P_N = 0.89078(8)$, as well as the\\nzero-temperature ferromagnetic--spin-glass transition. Finite-size scaling\\nanalysis reveals that the phase boundary for $T < T_N$ exhibits reentrant\\nbehavior. By analyzing the evolution of the magnetization-resolved density of\\nstates $g(E, M)$ and ground-state spin configurations against increasing\\nfrustration, we provide strong evidence that the zero-temperature transition is\\nquasi-first order. Finite-size scaling conducted on the spin-glass side\\nsupports the validity of $\\\\beta = 0$, with a correlation length exponent $\\\\nu =\\n1.50(8)$. Our results provide new insights into the nature of the\\nferromagnetic-to-spin-glass phase transition in an extensively degenerate\\nground state.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T10:10:34Z\"}"}
