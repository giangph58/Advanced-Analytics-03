Cosmological peculiar velocities point\\ntowards gravitational wells and away from potential hills, reflecting a\\nlarge-scale dipole in the gravitational potential, coherent over hundreds of\\nMpc. We predict large-scale dipoles in all fields correlated with the\\npotential, observable via effects of gravitational lensing and the integrated\\nSachs-Wolfe (ISW). The ISW dipole is distinct from the small-scale moving lens\\neffect, which has a dipole of the opposite sign. We provide a unified framework\\nfor analysing these dipoles, and make the first detections in galaxy density,\\nCMB lensing convergence and the ISW effect. We show that the observed signals\\nare consistent with LCDM predictions, and set limits on modified gravity. The\\nCMB dipole signal is independent of galaxy bias, and orthogonal to the monopole\\ncorrelation function, so this new observable provides additional cosmological\\ninformation (abridged).\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T12:29:36Z\"}"}
