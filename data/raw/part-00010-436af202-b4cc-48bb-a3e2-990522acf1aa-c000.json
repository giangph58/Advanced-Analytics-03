When sintering is driven by surface\\ntension, bridges emerge sequentially, favoring contacts between smaller\\nparticles first. Predicting the connectivity percolation threshold is key to\\nunderstanding and controlling the onset of sintering. We investigate ranked\\npercolation in granular packings, where particles connect based on contact\\nnumber. While the percolation threshold defined by the fraction of connected\\nparticles is non-universal and highly sensitive to particle size dispersion, we\\nfind that the critical number of sintered bridges per particle provides a\\nrobust estimator across different size distributions. Through numerical\\nsimulations and a mean-field approach, we link this robustness to the spatial\\ndistribution of contacts. Our results have broader implications for\\nunderstanding the resilience of spatially embedded networks under targeted\\nattacks.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:33:47Z\"}"}
