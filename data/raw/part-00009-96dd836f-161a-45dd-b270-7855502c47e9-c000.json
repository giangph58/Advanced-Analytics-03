Complex\\nformation results from the subtle interplay between different thermodynamic,\\nkinetic, and mechanistic contributions, which remain largely elusive to\\nstandard experimental methodologies and challenging for typical modeling\\napproaches. Here, we present an effective molecular simulation approach that\\ncan fully describe the chemical equilibrium and dynamics of metal complexes in\\nsolution, with atomistic detail. Application to Cd(II) and Ni(II) complexes\\nwith various amine ligands provides an excellent agreement with available\\nassociation constants and formation rates spanning several orders of magnitude.\\nMoreover, investigation of polydentate ligands allows unravelling the origin of\\nthe chelate effect as due to the concurrent contribution of entropy,\\ndissociation rates, and ligand binding mechanisms. This study represents a step\\nforward for the in silico design of coordination chemistry applications and for\\na better understanding of biochemical processes activated by metal binding.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:39:01Z\"}"}
