{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03375v1\", \"title\": \"Efficient Wi-Fi Sensing for IoT Forensics with Lossy Compression of CSI\\n  Data\", \"summary\": \"Wi-Fi sensing is an emerging technology that uses channel state information\\n(CSI) from ambient Wi-Fi signals to monitor human activity without the need for\\ndedicated sensors. Wi-Fi sensing does not only represent a pivotal technology\\nin intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) systems, but it can also provide\\nvaluable insights in forensic investigations. However, the high dimensionality\\nof CSI data presents major challenges for storage, transmission, and processing\\nin resource-constrained IoT environments. In this paper, we investigate the\\nimpact of lossy compression on the accuracy of Wi-Fi sensing, evaluating both\\ntraditional techniques and a deep learning-based approach. Our results reveal\\nthat simple, interpretable techniques based on principal component analysis can\\nsignificantly reduce the CSI data volume while preserving classification\\nperformance, making them highly suitable for lightweight IoT forensic\\nscenarios. On the other hand, deep learning models exhibit higher potential in\\ncomplex applications like activity recognition (achieving compression ratios up\\nto 16000:1 with minimal impact on sensing performance) but require careful\\ntuning and greater computational resources. By considering two different\\nsensing applications, this work demonstrates the feasibility of integrating\\nlossy compression schemes into Wi-Fi sensing pipelines to make intelligent IoT\\nsystems more efficient and improve the storage requirements in forensic\\napplications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T09:51:48Z\"}"}
