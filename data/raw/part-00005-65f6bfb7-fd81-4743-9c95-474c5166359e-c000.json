Peer punishment is\\noften considered as an effective incentive for promoting cooperation in such\\ncontexts. However, previous related studies have mostly ignored the positive\\nfeedback effect of collective contributions on individual payoffs. In this\\nwork, we explore global and local state-feedback, where the multiplication\\nfactor is positively correlated with the frequency of contributors in the\\nentire population or within the game group, respectively. By using replicator\\ndynamics in an infinite well-mixed population we reveal that state-based\\nfeedback plays a crucial role in alleviating the cooperative dilemma by\\nenhancing and sustaining cooperation compared to the feedback-free case.\\nMoreover, when the feedback strength is sufficiently strong or the baseline\\nmultiplication factor is sufficiently high, the system with local\\nstate-feedback provides full cooperation, hence supporting the ``think\\nglobally, act locally'' principle. Besides, we show that the second-order\\nfree-rider problem can be partially mitigated under certain conditions when the\\nstate-feedback is employed. Importantly, these results remain robust with\\nrespect to variations in punishment cost and fine.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T12:26:33Z\"}"}
