A\\nparametric discrete-time Markov chain (pDTMC) models the dressing process,\\nwhile Bayesian inference dynamically updates this pDTMC's transition\\nprobabilities based on sensory and user feedback. Safety constraints from\\nhazard analysis are expressed in probabilistic computation tree logic, and\\nsymbolically verified using a probabilistic model checker. We evaluate\\nreachability, cost, and reward trade-offs for garment-snag mitigation and\\nescalation, enabling real-time adaptation. Our approach provides a formal yet\\nlightweight foundation for safety-aware, explainable robotic assistance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T07:42:16Z\"}"}
