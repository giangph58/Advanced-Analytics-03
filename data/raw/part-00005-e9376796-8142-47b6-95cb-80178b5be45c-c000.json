In~\\\\cite{f2024b}, we confirmed the first\\npart of this prediction. In this paper, we complement these results by showing\\nthat if \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is small and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) large compared to the length of\\nthe line, then Wilson line expectations have exponential decay with\\nOrnstein-Zernike type behavior.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,hep-lat,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T06:42:34Z\"}"}
