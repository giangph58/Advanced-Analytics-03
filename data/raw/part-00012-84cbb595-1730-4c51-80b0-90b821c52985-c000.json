{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10838v1\", \"title\": \"Directional Expansiveness for Rd-Actions and for Penrose Tilings\", \"summary\": \"We define and study two kinds of directional expansiveness, weak and strong,\\nfor an action T of \\\\mathbb{R}^d on a compact metric space X. We show that for\\n\\\\mathbb{R}^2 finite local complexity (FLC) tiling dynamical systems, weak and\\nstrong expansiveness are the same, and are both equivalent to a simple coding\\nproperty. Then we show for the Penrose tiling dynamical system, which is FLC,\\nthere are exactly five non expansive directions, the directions perpendicular\\nto the 5th roots of unity. We also study Raphael Robinson's set of 24 Penrose\\nWang tiles and show the corresponding Penrose Wang tile dynamical system is\\nstrictly ergodic. Finally, we study two deformations of the Penrose Wang tile\\nsystem, one where the square Wang tiles are all deformed into a 2\\\\pi/5 rhombus,\\nand another where they are deformed into a set of eleven tetragon tiles. We\\nshow both of these are topologically conjugate to the Penrose tiling dynamical\\nsystem.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T03:43:06Z\"}"}
