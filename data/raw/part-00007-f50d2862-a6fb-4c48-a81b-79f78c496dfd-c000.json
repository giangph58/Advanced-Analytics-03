{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16711v1\", \"title\": \"A Unified Retrieval Framework with Document Ranking and EDU Filtering\\n  for Multi-document Summarization\", \"summary\": \"In the field of multi-document summarization (MDS), transformer-based models\\nhave demonstrated remarkable success, yet they suffer an input length\\nlimitation. Current methods apply truncation after the retrieval process to fit\\nthe context length; however, they heavily depend on manually well-crafted\\nqueries, which are impractical to create for each document set for MDS.\\nAdditionally, these methods retrieve information at a coarse granularity,\\nleading to the inclusion of irrelevant content. To address these issues, we\\npropose a novel retrieval-based framework that integrates query selection and\\ndocument ranking and shortening into a unified process. Our approach identifies\\nthe most salient elementary discourse units (EDUs) from input documents and\\nutilizes them as latent queries. These queries guide the document ranking by\\ncalculating relevance scores. Instead of traditional truncation, our approach\\nfilters out irrelevant EDUs to fit the context length, ensuring that only\\ncritical information is preserved for summarization. We evaluate our framework\\non multiple MDS datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements in ROUGE\\nmetrics while confirming its scalability and flexibility across diverse model\\narchitectures. Additionally, we validate its effectiveness through an in-depth\\nanalysis, emphasizing its ability to dynamically select appropriate queries and\\naccurately rank documents based on their relevance scores. These results\\ndemonstrate that our framework effectively addresses context-length\\nconstraints, establishing it as a robust and reliable solution for MDS.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T13:41:10Z\"}"}
