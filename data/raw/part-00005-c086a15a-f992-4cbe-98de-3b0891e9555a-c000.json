{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00488v1\", \"title\": \"MULE: Multi-terrain and Unknown Load Adaptation for Effective\\n  Quadrupedal Locomotion\", \"summary\": \"Quadrupedal robots are increasingly deployed for load-carrying tasks across\\ndiverse terrains. While Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based methods can\\naccount for payload variations, they often depend on predefined gait schedules\\nor trajectory generators, limiting their adaptability in unstructured\\nenvironments. To address these limitations, we propose an Adaptive\\nReinforcement Learning (RL) framework that enables quadrupedal robots to\\ndynamically adapt to both varying payloads and diverse terrains. The framework\\nconsists of a nominal policy responsible for baseline locomotion and an\\nadaptive policy that learns corrective actions to preserve stability and\\nimprove command tracking under payload variations. We validate the proposed\\napproach through large-scale simulation experiments in Isaac Gym and real-world\\nhardware deployment on a Unitree Go1 quadruped. The controller was tested on\\nflat ground, slopes, and stairs under both static and dynamic payload changes.\\nAcross all settings, our adaptive controller consistently outperformed the\\ncontroller in tracking body height and velocity commands, demonstrating\\nenhanced robustness and adaptability without requiring explicit gait design or\\nmanual tuning.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T12:41:35Z\"}"}
