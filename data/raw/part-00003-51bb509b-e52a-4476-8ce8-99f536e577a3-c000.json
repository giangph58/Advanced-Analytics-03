Blends host a\\nfraction of water molecules absorbed by the poly(vinyl alcohol) phase. Dc\\nconductivity and dielectric relaxation occur via fluctuation induced tunneling\\nof electrons. Electric charge transport is affected by the glass transition of\\nthe polymer matrix and the rotational and translational dynamics of absorbed\\nwater molecules. In the present work, absorbed water was subtracted by\\nannealing and pumping and, subsequently, dry blends were characterized by\\nemploying Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy at combined temperature and\\npressure states. Conductivity and relaxation obey fluctuation induced tunneling\\ntemperature dependencies. The corresponding activation energies and activation\\nvolumes reveal the role of absorbed polar water molecules on the tunneling\\ncurrent for macroscopic or localized electron transport.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph,cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T05:21:38Z\"}"}
