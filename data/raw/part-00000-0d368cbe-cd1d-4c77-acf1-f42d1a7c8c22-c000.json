{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15015v1\", \"title\": \"Identifying polycentric urban structure using the minimum cycle basis of\\n  road network as building blocks\", \"summary\": \"In a graph, the minimum cycle bases are a set of linearly independent cycles\\nthat can be used to represent any cycle within that cycle space of graph. These\\nbases are useful in various contexts, including the intricate analysis of\\nelectrical networks, structural engineering endeavors, chemical processes and\\nsurface reconstruction techniques etc. This study focuses on six cities in\\nChina to explore the topological characteristics, the centrality of nodes and\\nrobustness of urban road networks based on motif and minimum cycle bases. Some\\ninteresting conclusions are obtained: the frequency of motifs containing cycles\\nexceeds that of random networks with equivalent degree sequences; the frequency\\ndistribution of minimum cycle's length and surface areas obey the power-law\\ndistribution. The cycle contribution rate is introduced to investigate the\\ncentrality of nodes within road networks, and has a significant impact on the\\ntotal number of cycles in the robustness analysis. Finally, we construct two\\ntypes of cycle-based dual networks for urban road networks by representing\\ncycles as nodes and establishing edges between two cycles sharing a common node\\nand edge respectively. The results show that cycle-based dual networks exhibit\\nsmall-world and scale-free properties.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T10:47:50Z\"}"}
