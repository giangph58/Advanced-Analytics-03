In this paper, we study such batch\\ndecompositions from a probabilistic perspective. We assume that data points\\n(possibly corrupted) are drawn independently from a given space and define a\\nconcept of similarity between two data points. We then consider decompositions\\nthat restrict the amount of similarity within each batch and obtain high\\nprobability bounds for the minimum size. We demonstrate an inherent tradeoff\\nbetween relaxing the similarity constraint and the overall size and also use\\nmartingale methods to obtain bounds for the maximum size of data subsets with a\\ngiven similarity.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,math.PR,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T15:58:06Z\"}"}
