Two boundary-type cost functionals are\\nconsidered, and their corresponding variations with respect to shapes are\\nderived using the adjoint method, employing the chain rule approach. This\\ninvolves firstly utilizing the material derivative of the state system and\\nsecondly using its shape derivative. Subsequently, an alternating direction\\nmethod of multipliers (ADMM) combined with the Sobolev-gradient-descent\\nalgorithm is applied to stably solve the shape reconstruction problem.\\nNumerical experiments in two and three dimensions are conducted to demonstrate\\nthe feasibility of the methods.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.NA,math.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:36:56Z\"}"}
