While most studies assume\\npurely diffusive movement, additional movement components can significantly\\nalter habitat requirements. Here, we investigate how critical patch sizes are\\naffected by stochastic resetting, where each organism intermittently returns to\\na common fixed location, modeling behaviors such as homing, refuge-seeking, or\\nmovement toward essential resources. We analytically derive the total\\npopulation growth over time and the critical patch size. Our results are\\nvalidated by agent-based simulations, showing excellent agreement. Our findings\\ndemonstrate that stochastic resetting can either increase or decrease the\\ncritical patch size, depending on the reset rate, reset position, and external\\nenvironmental hostility. These results highlight how intermittent relocation\\nshapes ecological thresholds and may provide insights for ecological modeling\\nand conservation planning, particularly in fragmented landscapes such as in\\ndeforested regions.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech,physics.bio-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T17:54:05Z\"}"}
