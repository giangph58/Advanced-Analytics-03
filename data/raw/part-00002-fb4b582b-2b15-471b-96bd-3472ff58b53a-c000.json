In\\nthis paper, we construct such a model for the ordered configuration space of\\n$m$ points in an oriented surface $\\\\Sigma$. More specifically, we prove that if\\nwe give $\\\\Sigma$ a certain cube complex structure $K$, then the ordered\\nconfiguration space of $m$ points in $\\\\Sigma$ is homotopy equivalent to a\\nsubcomplex of $K^{m}$\", \"main_category\": \"math.AT\", \"categories\": \"math.AT,math.CO,math.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:54:14Z\"}"}
