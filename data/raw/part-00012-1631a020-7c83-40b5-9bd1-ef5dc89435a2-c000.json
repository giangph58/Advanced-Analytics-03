{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10862v1\", \"title\": \"Testing redshift variation of the X-ray and ultraviolet luminosity\\n  relations of quasars\", \"summary\": \"Quasars serve as important cosmological probes and constructing accurate\\nluminosity relations for them is essential for their use in cosmology. If the\\ncoefficients of quasar's luminosity relation vary with redshift, it could\\nintroduce biases into cosmological constraints derived from quasars. In this\\npaper, we conduct a detailed analysis of the redshift variation in the X-ray\\nluminosity and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity ($L_\\\\mathrm{X}$-$L_\\\\mathrm{UV}$)\\nrelations of quasars. For the standard $L_\\\\mathrm{X}$-$L_\\\\mathrm{UV}$ relation,\\nwe find that the relation coefficients exhibit a strong and linear correlation\\nwith redshift, which is not attributable to the selection effect. Additionally,\\nwe examine two three-dimensional, redshift-evolving\\n$L_\\\\mathrm{X}$-$L_\\\\mathrm{UV}$ relations and find that the inclusion of a\\nredshift-dependent term does not eliminate the impact of redshift evolution, as\\nthe relation coefficients continue to evolve with redshift. Finally, we\\nconstruct a new $L_\\\\mathrm{X}$-$L_\\\\mathrm{UV}$ relation in which the redshift\\nevolution of the relation coefficients is nearly eliminated. Calibrating the\\nluminosity relations using Hubble parameter measurements, we demonstrate that\\nquasars utilizing our new relation yield effective constraints on cosmological\\nparameters that are consistent with results from Planck CMB data, unlike\\nconstraints derived from the standard relation.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T04:48:23Z\"}"}
