We study the effect of the\\npresence of a fraction $r$ of quenched impurities (which act as rigid walkers)\\non the dynamics. Here, in case two domain walls or one impurity and one domain\\nwall happen to be on the same site, both get simultaneously annihilated. It is\\nfound that for any non-zero value of $r$, the dynamical behaviour changes as\\nthe surviving fraction of particles $\\\\rho(t)$ attains a constant value.\\n$\\\\rho(t)t^\\\\alpha $ shows a universal behaviour when plotted against $r^\\\\beta t$\\nwith $\\\\alpha, \\\\beta$ values depending on whether the particles are rigid or\\nnonrigid. Also, the values differ for the biased and unbiased cases. The time\\nscale associated with the particle decay obtained in several ways shows that it\\nvaries with $r$ in a power law manner with a universal exponent.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T08:59:34Z\"}"}
