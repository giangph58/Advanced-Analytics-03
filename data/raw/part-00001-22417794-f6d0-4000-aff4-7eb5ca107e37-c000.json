{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12677v1\", \"title\": \"Excitation transfer and many-body dark states in WQED\", \"summary\": \"In one-dimensional waveguide quantum electrodynamics systems, quantum\\nemitters interact through infinite-range, dispersive, and dissipative\\ndipole-dipole interactions mediated by guided photonic modes. These\\ninteractions give rise to long-range periodic behavior and rich many-body\\nphysics absent in free space. In this work, we construct a set of symmetrized\\nM-excitation dark states and derive analytic expressions for their\\ntime-evolution projections. This framework captures the essential dynamics of\\nexcitation transport and storage while significantly reducing computational\\ncomplexity compared to full quantum simulations. Our analysis reveals a\\nfundamental bound on energy redistribution governed by the structure of dark\\nstates and collective dissipation, and discovers that optimal excitation\\ntransfer between emitter ensembles converges toward an initial pumped fraction\\nof $N_\\\\text{p}/N \\\\approx 0.55$ for large system sizes. We further examine the\\nrobustness of this mechanism under realistic imperfections, including\\npositional disorder, nonradiative decay, and dephasing. These results highlight\\nthe role of many-body dark states in enabling efficient and controllable energy\\ntransfer, offering new insights into dissipative many-body dynamics in\\nintegrated quantum platforms.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T06:07:22Z\"}"}
