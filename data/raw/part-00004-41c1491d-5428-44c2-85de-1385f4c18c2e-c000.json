A graph is perfectly divisible if for each of its\\ninduced subgraph $H$, $V(H)$ can be partitioned into $A$ and $B$ such that\\n$H[A]$ is perfect and $\\\\omega(H[B]) < \\\\omega(H)$. In this paper, we prove that\\nthe perfect divisibility of fork-free graphs is equivalent to that of claw-free\\ngraphs. We also prove that, for $F\\\\in \\\\{P_7, P_6\\\\cup K_1\\\\}$, each (fork,\\n$F$)-free graph $G$ is perfectly divisible and hence $\\\\chi(G)\\\\leq\\n\\\\binom{\\\\omega(G)+1}{2}$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T05:08:16Z\"}"}
