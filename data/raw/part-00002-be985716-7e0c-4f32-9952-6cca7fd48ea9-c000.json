TRACE now supports collisional fragmentation and can\\nhandle both removing and adding particles mid-timestep. We describe the\\nback-end logic implemented for robust collision support, and compare TRACE's\\nperformance to other integrators including MERCURIUS on a large-N\\nprotoplanetary disk simulation with various collision prescriptions, a system\\nwhich TRACE previously could not handle. TRACE matches the behavior of these\\nintegrators, while offering potentially vast speedups of over 70x. All updates\\ndescribed in this Note are available with the most recent public release of\\nREBOUND.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T13:24:30Z\"}"}
