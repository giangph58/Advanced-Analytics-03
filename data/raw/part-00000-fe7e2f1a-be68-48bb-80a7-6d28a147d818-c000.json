Using the Schrieffer-Wolff\\ntransformation, we exclude the doubly occupied states raising the on-site\\nCoulomb energy and derive resulting spin interactions from the two-orbital\\nHubbard model. We also introduce effective interactions attributed to the\\ninterorbital Coulomb interaction. To adapt the effective model to bilayer\\nnickelates that exhibit high-temperature superconductivity, we quantitatively\\nevaluate the strengths of the spin interactions based on the hopping parameters\\nin La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Considering the evaluated effective interactions, we\\npropose a simplified $t$-$J$ model for bilayer nickelate superconductors.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T11:25:29Z\"}"}
