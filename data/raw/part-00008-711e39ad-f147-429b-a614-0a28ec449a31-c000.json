{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17537v1\", \"title\": \"Long-time asymptotics of the Sawada-Kotera equation on the line\", \"summary\": \"The Sawada-Kotera (SK) equation is an integrable system characterized by a\\nthird-order Lax operator and is related to the modified Sawada-Kotera (mSK)\\nequation through a Miura transformation. This work formulates the\\nRiemann-Hilbert problem associated with the SK and mSK equations by using\\ndirect and inverse scattering transforms. The long-time asymptotic behaviors of\\nthe solutions to these equations are then analyzed via the Deift-Zhou steepest\\ndescent method for Riemann-Hilbert problems. It is shown that the asymptotic\\nsolutions of the SK and mSK equations are categorized into four distinct\\nregions: the decay region, the dispersive wave region, the Painlev\\\\'{e} region,\\nand the rapid decay region. Notably, the Painlev\\\\'{e} region is governed by the\\nF-XVIII equation in the Painlev\\\\'{e} classification of fourth-order ordinary\\ndifferential equations, a fourth-order analogue of the Painlev\\\\'{e}\\ntranscendents. This connection is established through the Riemann-Hilbert\\nformulation in this work. Similar to the KdV equation, the SK equation exhibits\\na transition region between the dispersive wave and Painlev\\\\'{e} regions,\\narising from the special values of the reflection coefficients at the origin.\\nFinally, numerical comparisons demonstrate that the asymptotic solutions agree\\nexcellently with results from direct numerical simulations.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.SI\", \"categories\": \"nlin.SI,math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T13:26:20Z\"}"}
