As compared to classical\\nsystems, quantum systems add complexity due to quantum correlations. Recent\\nworks have explored anomalous relaxation and Mpemba-like effects in several\\nquantum systems, considering isolated systems at zero temperature or open\\nsystems in contact with reservoirs under Markovian or non-Markovian dynamics.\\nHowever, these models typically assume an initial unentangled system-bath\\nstate, overlooking the role of initial system-environment correlations. Here we\\npropose a type of quantum Mpemba effect, distinct from the strong Mpemba\\neffect, originating from initial system-bath entanglement solely. It is shown\\nthat the degree of initial entanglement significantly influences the early\\nrelaxation dynamics, with certain conditions causing backflow and retarded\\nthermalization. As an example, we investigate the spontaneous emission of a\\ntwo-level atom in a photonic waveguide at zero temperature, where an initial\\natom-photon entangled state results in delayed relaxation and pronounced Mpemba\\neffect. These findings highlight the crucial role of quantum correlations in\\nthermalization processes and open new avenues for identifying and engineering\\nquantum Mpemba phenomena. Controlling relaxation dynamics through\\nsystem-environment entanglement may have potential applications in quantum\\nthermal machines, state initialization protocols, and quantum information\\nprocessing, where precise control over thermalization is essential.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T15:58:17Z\"}"}
