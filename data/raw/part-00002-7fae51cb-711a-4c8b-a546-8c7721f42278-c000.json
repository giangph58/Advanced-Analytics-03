{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15663v1\", \"title\": \"FADEL: Uncertainty-aware Fake Audio Detection with Evidential Deep\\n  Learning\", \"summary\": \"Recently, fake audio detection has gained significant attention, as\\nadvancements in speech synthesis and voice conversion have increased the\\nvulnerability of automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems to spoofing\\nattacks. A key challenge in this task is generalizing models to detect unseen,\\nout-of-distribution (OOD) attacks. Although existing approaches have shown\\npromising results, they inherently suffer from overconfidence issues due to the\\nusage of softmax for classification, which can produce unreliable predictions\\nwhen encountering unpredictable spoofing attempts. To deal with this\\nlimitation, we propose a novel framework called fake audio detection with\\nevidential learning (FADEL). By modeling class probabilities with a Dirichlet\\ndistribution, FADEL incorporates model uncertainty into its predictions,\\nthereby leading to more robust performance in OOD scenarios. Experimental\\nresults on the ASVspoof2019 Logical Access (LA) and ASVspoof2021 LA datasets\\nindicate that the proposed method significantly improves the performance of\\nbaseline models. Furthermore, we demonstrate the validity of uncertainty\\nestimation by analyzing a strong correlation between average uncertainty and\\nequal error rate (EER) across different spoofing algorithms.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.AS\", \"categories\": \"eess.AS,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T07:40:35Z\"}"}
