Instead of\\nthe classical center manifold approach for the existence of small-amplitude\\nboundary layer solutions in the previous results, the delicate global phase\\nplane analysis, based on the qualitative theory of ODEs, is utilized to obtain\\nthe sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence/non-existence of\\nlarge boundary layer solutions to the half-space inflow problem when the right\\nend state belongs to the supersonic, transonic, and subsonic regions,\\nrespectively, which completely answers the existence/non-existence of boundary\\nlayer solutions to the half-space inflow problem of 1D full compressible\\nNavier-Stokes equations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:34:59Z\"}"}
