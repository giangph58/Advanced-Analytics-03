{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05213v1\", \"title\": \"Overlapping Biclustering\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we introduce Bicluster Editing with Vertex Splitting, a\\nvariant of the Bicluster Editing problem, which aims to transform a given graph\\ninto a bicluster graph using a minimum number of operations. In Bicluster\\nEditing, the allowed operations are the insertion and deletion of edges. In\\nBicluster Editing with Vertex Splitting we additionally allow overlapping\\nclusters, which we model by allowing vertex splits. We prove that Bicluster\\nEditing with Vertex Splitting is NP-complete. On the positive side, we show\\nthat it admits a polynomial kernel with respect to the number k of allowed edit\\noperations and present an algorithm running in O(k^{11k} + n + m) time, where n\\nand m denote the number of vertices and edges in the input graph, respectively.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:06:18Z\"}"}
