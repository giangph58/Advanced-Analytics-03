However, broadband experiments such as X-ray\\nabsorption near edge spectroscopy or resonant inelastic X-ray scattering\\nrequire a detailed knowledge of the electronic structure and transition matrix\\nelements. Here, we show how to fill this gap by combining the Maxwell-X-ray\\nBloch formalism with first-principles calculations treating explicitly the core\\nstates. The resulting X-ray absorption spectrum recovers key spectral\\nsignatures which were missing in our previous work relying on a semi-empirical\\ntight-binding approach.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:28:30Z\"}"}
