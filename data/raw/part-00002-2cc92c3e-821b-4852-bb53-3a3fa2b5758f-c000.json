Our analysis relies on uniform relative entropy estimates and\\nKolmogorov's compactness criterion to establish tightness and convergence of\\nthe fluctuation process. In this framework, an extension of the exponential law\\nof large numbers is used to derive the necessary uniform estimates, while a\\nconditional Fubini theorem is employed in the identification of the limit in\\nthe presence of common noise. We demonstrate that the fluctuation process\\nconverges in distribution to the unique solution of a linear stochastic\\nevolution equation. This work extends previous fluctuation results beyond the\\nclassical Lipschitz framework.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:12:55Z\"}"}
