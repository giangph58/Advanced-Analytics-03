The essential part\\nof the paper is a new construction of the basic space\\n$\\\\mathcal{K}_{-1/2}(\\\\RR_+)$, ensuring Montel space properties that guarantee\\ndesirable topological features such as the equivalence of weak and strong\\nconvergence. Also, we prove the continuity of the FrHT on this Montel space,\\nboth in function and distribution settings. The paper concludes with a\\nTauberian theorem that provides the converse implication showing that under\\nappropriate growth and limit conditions the asymptotic behavior of the original\\ndistribution can be deduced from that of its FrHT. For this purpose a new space\\n$\\\\mathcal B_{-1/2}(\\\\RR_+)$ is construct.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T10:28:41Z\"}"}
