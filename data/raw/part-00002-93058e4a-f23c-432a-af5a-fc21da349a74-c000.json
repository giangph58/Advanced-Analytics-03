{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17570v1\", \"title\": \"Atemporality from Conservation Laws of Physics in Lorentzian-Euclidean\\n  Black Hole\", \"summary\": \"Recent results have shown that singularities can be avoided from the general\\nrelativistic standpoint in Lorentzian-Euclidean black holes by means of the\\ntransition from a Lorentzian to an Euclidean region where time loses its\\nphysical meaning and becomes imaginary. This dynamical mechanism, dubbed\\n``atemporality'', prevents the emergence of black hole singularities and the\\nviolation of conservation laws. In this paper, the notion of atemporality\\ntogether with a detailed discussion of its implications is presented from a\\nphilosophical perspective. The main result consists in showing that\\natemporality is naturally related to conservation laws.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.HE,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T13:59:42Z\"}"}
