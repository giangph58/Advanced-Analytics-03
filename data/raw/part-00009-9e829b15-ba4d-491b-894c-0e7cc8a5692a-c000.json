This report presents a plan for an\\nexploratory study to investigate how PTMs are utilized, maintained, and tested\\nin OSS projects, focusing on models hosted on platforms like Hugging Face and\\nPyTorch Hub. We plan to explore how PTMs are used in open-source software\\nprojects and their related maintenance practices by mining software\\nrepositories that use PTMs and analyzing their code-base, historical data, and\\nreported issues. This study aims to provide actionable insights into improving\\nthe use and sustainability of PTM in open-source projects and a step towards a\\nfoundation for advancing software engineering practices in the context of model\\ndependencies.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:41:13Z\"}"}
