{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04158v1\", \"title\": \"FilterTS: Comprehensive Frequency Filtering for Multivariate Time Series\\n  Forecasting\", \"summary\": \"Multivariate time series forecasting is crucial across various industries,\\nwhere accurate extraction of complex periodic and trend components can\\nsignificantly enhance prediction performance. However, existing models often\\nstruggle to capture these intricate patterns. To address these challenges, we\\npropose FilterTS, a novel forecasting model that utilizes specialized filtering\\ntechniques based on the frequency domain. FilterTS introduces a Dynamic\\nCross-Variable Filtering Module, a key innovation that dynamically leverages\\nother variables as filters to extract and reinforce shared variable frequency\\ncomponents across variables in multivariate time series. Additionally, a Static\\nGlobal Filtering Module captures stable frequency components, identified\\nthroughout the entire training set. Moreover, the model is built in the\\nfrequency domain, converting time-domain convolutions into frequency-domain\\nmultiplicative operations to enhance computational efficiency. Extensive\\nexperimental results on eight real-world datasets have demonstrated that\\nFilterTS significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of prediction\\naccuracy and computational efficiency.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T06:19:00Z\"}"}
