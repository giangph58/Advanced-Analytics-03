{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23991v1\", \"title\": \"Deviation Between Team-Optimal Solution and Nash Equilibrium in Flow\\n  Assignment Problems\", \"summary\": \"We investigate the relationship between the team-optimal solution and the\\nNash equilibrium (NE) to assess the impact of strategy deviation on team\\nperformance. As a working use case, we focus on a class of flow assignment\\nproblems in which each source node acts as a cooperating decision maker (DM)\\nwithin a team that minimizes the team cost based on the team-optimal strategy.\\nIn practice, some selfish DMs may prioritize their own marginal cost and\\ndeviate from NE strategies, thus potentially degrading the overall performance.\\nTo quantify this deviation, we explore the deviation bound between the\\nteam-optimal solution and the NE in two specific scenarios: (i) when the\\nteam-optimal solution is unique and (ii) when multiple solutions do exist. This\\nhelps DMs analyze the factors influencing the deviation and adopting the NE\\nstrategy within a tolerable range. Furthermore, in the special case of a\\npotential game model, we establish the consistency between the team-optimal\\nsolution and the NE. Once the consistency condition is satisfied, the strategy\\ndeviation does not alter the total cost, and DMs do not face a strategic\\ntrade-off. Finally, we validate our theoretical analysis through some\\nsimulation studies.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GT\", \"categories\": \"cs.GT,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T12:06:09Z\"}"}
