{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11848v1\", \"title\": \"Proximal Inference on Population Intervention Indirect Effect\", \"summary\": \"The population intervention indirect effect (PIIE) is a novel mediation\\neffect representing the indirect component of the population intervention\\neffect. Unlike traditional mediation measures, such as the natural indirect\\neffect, the PIIE holds particular relevance in observational studies involving\\nunethical exposures, when hypothetical interventions that impose harmful\\nexposures are inappropriate. Although prior research has identified PIIE under\\nunmeasured confounders between exposure and outcome, it has not fully addressed\\nthe confounding that affects the mediator. This study extends the PIIE\\nidentification to settings where unmeasured confounders influence\\nexposure-outcome, exposure-mediator, and mediator-outcome relationships.\\nSpecifically, we leverage observed covariates as proxy variables for unmeasured\\nconfounders, constructing three proximal identification frameworks.\\nAdditionally, we characterize the semiparametric efficiency bound and develop\\nmultiply robust and locally efficient estimators. To handle high-dimensional\\nnuisance parameters, we propose a debiased machine learning approach that\\nachieves $\\\\sqrt{n}$-consistency and asymptotic normality to estimate the true\\nPIIE values, even when the machine learning estimators for the nuisance\\nfunctions do not converge at $\\\\sqrt{n}$-rate. In simulations, our estimators\\ndemonstrate higher confidence interval coverage rates than conventional methods\\nacross various model misspecifications. In a real data application, our\\napproaches reveal an indirect effect of alcohol consumption on depression risk\\nmediated by depersonalization symptoms.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,math.ST,stat.ML,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T08:14:55Z\"}"}
