{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21540v1\", \"title\": \"Improving Informally Romanized Language Identification\", \"summary\": \"The Latin script is often used to informally write languages with non-Latin\\nnative scripts. In many cases (e.g., most languages in India), there is no\\nconventional spelling of words in the Latin script, hence there will be high\\nspelling variability in written text. Such romanization renders languages that\\nare normally easily distinguished based on script highly confusable, such as\\nHindi and Urdu. In this work, we increase language identification (LID)\\naccuracy for romanized text by improving the methods used to synthesize\\ntraining sets. We find that training on synthetic samples which incorporate\\nnatural spelling variation yields higher LID system accuracy than including\\navailable naturally occurring examples in the training set, or even training\\nhigher capacity models. We demonstrate new state-of-the-art LID performance on\\nromanized text from 20 Indic languages in the Bhasha-Abhijnaanam evaluation set\\n(Madhani et al., 2023a), improving test F1 from the reported 74.7% (using a\\npretrained neural model) to 85.4% using a linear classifier trained solely on\\nsynthetic data and 88.2% when also training on available harvested text.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T11:36:28Z\"}"}
