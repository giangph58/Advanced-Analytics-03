Here, we have\\nsynthesized two new rare-earth compounds Rb$_3$Yb(VO$_4$)$_2$ and\\nCs$_3$Yb(VO$_4$)$_2$. X-ray diffractions reveal a perfect triangular-lattice\\nstructure with no detectable disorder. Magnetic susceptibility measurements do\\nnot capture any phase transition or spin freezing down to 1.8~K. A fit to\\nlow-temperature data indicates dominant antiferromagnetic interactions with the\\nCurie-Weiss temperature of -1.40~K and -0.43~K for Rb$_3$Yb(VO$_4$)$_2$ and\\nCs$_3$Yb(VO$_4$)$_2$, respectively. Specific heat results show no sign of\\nlong-range magnetic order down to $\\\\sim$0.1~K either, but only a Schottky\\nanomaly that is continuously mediated by the external magnetic fields.\\nAdditionally, inelastic neutron scattering is employed to detect low-energy\\nspin excitations in Rb$_3$Yb(VO$_4$)$_2$. The absence of magnetic excitation\\nsignals as well as static magnetic order down to 97~mK aligns with the results\\nfrom magnetic susceptibility and specific heat. Collectively, these findings\\npoint to a quantum disordered ground state with persistent spin dynamics,\\nreminiscent of QSL behaviors. Our work provides a promising platform for\\nfurther exploration of quantum magnetism in this new disorder-free system.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T12:02:05Z\"}"}
