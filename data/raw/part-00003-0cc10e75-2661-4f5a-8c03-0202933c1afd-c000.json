{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12832v1\", \"title\": \"Physics of an AMOC Overshoot in a Box Model\", \"summary\": \"Recently the global average temperature has temporarily exceeded the\\n1.5{\\\\deg}C goal of the Paris Agreement, and so an overshoot of various climate\\ntipping elements becomes increasingly likely. In this study we analyze the\\nphysical processes of an overshoot of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning\\nCirculation (AMOC), one of the major tipping elements, using a conceptual box\\nmodel. Here either the atmospheric temperature above the North Atlantic, or the\\nfreshwater forcing into the North Atlantic overshoot their respective critical\\nboundaries. In both cases a higher forcing rate can prevent a collapse of the\\nAMOC, since a higher rate of forcing causes initially a fresher North Atlantic,\\nwhich in turn results in a higher northward transport by the subtropical gyre\\nsupplementing the salinity loss in time. For small exceedance amplitudes the\\nAMOC is still resilient as the forcing rates can be low and so other state\\nvariables outside of the North Atlantic can adjust. Contrarily, for larger\\novershoots the trajectories are dynamically similar and we find a lower limit\\nin volume and exceedance time for respectively freshwater and temperature\\nforcing in order to prevent a collapse. Moreover, for a large overshoot an\\nincreased air-sea temperature coupling has a destabilizing effect, while the\\nreverse holds for an overshoot close to the tipping point. The understanding of\\nthe physics of the AMOC overshoot behavior is important for interpreting\\nresults of Earth System Models and for evaluating the effects of mitigation and\\nintervention strategies.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T10:46:21Z\"}"}
