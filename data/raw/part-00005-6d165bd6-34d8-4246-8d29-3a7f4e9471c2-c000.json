{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07744v1\", \"title\": \"MMLA: Multi-Environment, Multi-Species, Low-Altitude Aerial Footage\\n  Dataset\", \"summary\": \"Real-time wildlife detection in drone imagery is critical for numerous\\napplications, including animal ecology, conservation, and biodiversity\\nmonitoring. Low-altitude drone missions are effective for collecting\\nfine-grained animal movement and behavior data, particularly if missions are\\nautomated for increased speed and consistency. However, little work exists on\\nevaluating computer vision models on low-altitude aerial imagery and\\ngeneralizability across different species and settings. To fill this gap, we\\npresent a novel multi-environment, multi-species, low-altitude aerial footage\\n(MMLA) dataset. MMLA consists of drone footage collected across three diverse\\nenvironments: Ol Pejeta Conservancy and Mpala Research Centre in Kenya, and The\\nWilds Conservation Center in Ohio, which includes five species: Plains zebras,\\nGrevy's zebras, giraffes, onagers, and African Painted Dogs. We comprehensively\\nevaluate three YOLO models (YOLOv5m, YOLOv8m, and YOLOv11m) for detecting\\nanimals. Results demonstrate significant performance disparities across\\nlocations and species-specific detection variations. Our work highlights the\\nimportance of evaluating detection algorithms across different environments for\\nrobust wildlife monitoring applications using drones.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T13:40:27Z\"}"}
