However, existing laser-driven ion\\nacceleration schemes often produce broad energy spectra and limited control\\nover ion species. Here we propose the acceleration mechanism, boosted Coulomb\\nexplosion, initiated by a standing wave, which is formed in a pre-expanded\\nplasma by the interference between a continuously incoming main laser pulse and\\nthe pulse reflected by a solid target, where the pre-expanded plasma is formed\\nfrom a thin layer on the solid target by a relatively strong pre-pulse. This\\nmechanism produces a persistent Coulomb field on the target front side with\\nfield strengths on the order of TV/m for picoseconds. We experimentally\\ndemonstrate generation of quasi-monoenergetic deuterons up to 50 MeV using an\\nin-situ D$_2$O-deposited target. Our results show that the peak energy can be\\ntuned by the laser pulse duration.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T13:33:10Z\"}"}
