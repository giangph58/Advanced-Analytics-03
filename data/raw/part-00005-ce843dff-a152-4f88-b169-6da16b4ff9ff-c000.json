Our study took place during summer 2024 and\\nbuilds on work presented at DH2017 (Bailey-Ross et al., 2017). Our\\ninterdisciplinary team included researchers from digital humanities,\\npsychology, art history and computer science, working in collaboration with\\nprofessionals from the museum. We used fixed and mobile eye tracking to\\nunderstand how museum visitors view art in a physical gallery setting. This\\nresearch will enable us to make recommendations about how the Museum's\\ncollections could be more effectively displayed, encouraging visitors to engage\\nwith them more fully.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:12:30Z\"}"}
