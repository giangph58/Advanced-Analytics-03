We introduce and study the\\nclass of analytic relatively operator Lipschitz functions. An essential role is\\nplayed by double operator integrals with respect to semispectral measures. We\\nalso study the class of analytic resolvent Lipschitz functions. Then we obtain\\na trace formula in the case of relatively trace class perturbations and show\\nthat the maximal class of function for which the trace formula holds in the\\ncase of relatively trace class perturbations coincides with the class of\\nanalytic relatively operator Lipschitz functions. We also establish the\\ninequality $\\\\int|\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\xi}(t)|(1+|t|)^{-1}\\\\,{\\\\rm d}t<\\\\infty$ for the\\nspectral shift function $\\\\boldsymbol\\\\xi$ in the case of relatively trace class\\nperturbations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA,math.CA,math.CV,math.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T16:37:12Z\"}"}
