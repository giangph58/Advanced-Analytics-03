If Tr${}^E_F(y)=\\\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\\\sigma^i y=0$,\\nthen the additive form of Hilbert's Theorem 90 asserts that $y=\\\\sigma x-x$ for\\nsome $x\\\\in E$. Suppose that $E$ has characteristic $p$. We prove that $x$ gives\\nrise to a periodic sequence $x_0,x_1,\\\\dots$ which has period $pn_p$, where\\n$n_p$ is the largest $p$-power that divides $n$. As an application, we find\\nclosed-form expressions for the roots of Artin-Schreier polynomials $t^p-t-y$.\\nLet $y$ lie in the finite field $F_{p^n}$ of order $p^n$. The Artin-Schreier\\npolynomial $t^p-t-y\\\\in F_{p^n}[t]$ is reducible precisely when\\n$\\\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}y^{p^i}=0$. In this case, $t^p-t-y=\\\\prod_{k=0}^{p-1}(t-x-k)$\\nwhere $x=\\\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\\\sum_{j=0}^{i-1}z^{p^j}y^{p^i}$ for some $z\\\\in\\nF_{p^e}$ and $e=n_p$.
