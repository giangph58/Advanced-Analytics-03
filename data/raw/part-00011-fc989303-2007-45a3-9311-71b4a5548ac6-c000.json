{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03592v1\", \"title\": \"95 GeV Higgs boson and nano-Hertz gravitational waves from domain walls\\n  in the N2HDM\", \"summary\": \"We explore the diphoton and $b\\\\bar{b}$ excesses at 95.4 GeV, as well as\\nnano-Hertz gravitational waves originating from domain walls, within the\\nframework of the next-to-two-Higgs-doublet model (N2HDM), which extends the\\ntwo-Higgs-doublet model by introducing a real singlet scalar subject to a\\ndiscrete $Z_2$ symmetry. The $Z_2$ symmetry is spontaneously broken by the\\nnon-zero vacuum expectation value of the singlet scalar, $v_s$, which leads to\\nthe formation of domain walls. We discuss two different scenarios: in scenario\\nA, the 95.4 GeV Higgs boson predominantly originates from the singlet field,\\nwhile in scenario B, it arises mainly from the CP-even components of the Higgs\\ndoublets. Taking into account relevant theoretical and experimental\\nconstraints, we find that scenario A can fully account for both the diphoton\\nand $b\\\\bar{b}$ excesses at 95.4 GeV within the $1\\\\sigma$ range. Moreover, the\\npeak amplitude of the gravitational wave spectrum at a peak frequency of\\n$10^{-9}$ Hz can reach $2 \\\\times 10^{-12}$ for $v_s = 100$ TeV. Scenario B only\\nmarginally accounts for the diphoton and $b\\\\bar{b}$ excesses at the $1\\\\sigma$\\nlevel, but the peak amplitude of the gravitational wave spectrum at the peak\\nfrequency of $10^{-9}$ Hz can reach $6\\\\times 10^{-8}$ for $v_s=100$ TeV. The\\nnano-Hertz gravitational wave signals predicted in both scenarios can be tested\\nby the current and future pulsar timing array projects.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T14:50:29Z\"}"}
