Despite their impact on the\\npublic, these frameworks do not define means or mechanisms for transparency\\ntowards the public, leading to reduced trust and complex tracking processes.\\n  We analyse the German guideline for railway-infrastructural modifications\\nfrom proposal to approval, using the guideline as a motivating example for\\nmodelling decisions in processes using digital signatures and zero-knowledge\\nproofs. Therein, a verifier can verify that a process was executed correctly by\\nthe involved parties and according to specification without learning\\nconfidential information such as trade secrets or identities of the\\nparticipants. We validate our system by applying it to the railway process,\\ndemonstrating how it realises various rules, and we evaluate its scalability\\nwith increased process complexities. Our solution is not railway-specific but\\nalso applicable to other contexts, helping leverage zero-knowledge proofs for\\npublic transparency and trust.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T09:54:38Z\"}"}
