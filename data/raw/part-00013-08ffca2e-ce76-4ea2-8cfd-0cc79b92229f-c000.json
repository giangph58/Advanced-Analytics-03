This background can be obtained in different ways in this\\ntheory. We first consider an arbitrary potential to implement an effective\\ncosmological constant. The scalar field has long range whereas its potential\\ncan induce a mass term, rendering its range to short distances. A second effect\\nof the potential is the possibility to induce a background curvature or an\\neffective cosmological constant via the minimum of the potential. The latter is\\nusually ignored in the literature to have an asymptotically flat background for\\nthe gravitational waves. In order to fill this gap, we consider the effects of\\nthe scalar potential in the framework of gravitational waves in the theories\\nhaving such scalar couplings, and compare its effects with other approaches\\nsuch as the presence of a vacuum energy density filling the spacetime or a\\nlinear potential which leads to an effective cosmological constant but now with\\na massless scalar field. We discuss properties of the gravitational waves,\\ntheir propagation and interaction with the medium in which they propagate. The\\nminimum of the scalar potential term mimics a cosmological constant and leads\\nto separate redshifts in the effective frequency and wave number, which also\\ndiscriminates the tensorial and massive scalar waves. We see that, depending on\\nthe implementation to have a cosmological constant, the propagation speeds and\\npolarization properties of scalar modes of these waves is different, as\\nsummarized in the paper.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:51:33Z\"}"}
