{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11776v1\", \"title\": \"ALMASOP. Detection of Turbulence-induced Mass Assembly Shocks in\\n  Starless Cores\", \"summary\": \"Star formation is a series of mass assembly processes and starless cores,\\nthose cold and dense condensations in molecular clouds, play a pivotal role as\\ninitial seeds of stars. With only a limited sample of known starless cores,\\nhowever, the origin and growth of such stellar precursors had not been well\\ncharacterized previously. Meanwhile, the recent discovery of CH$_3$OH emission,\\nwhich is generally associated with desorbed icy mantle in warm regions,\\nparticularly at the periphery of starless cores also remains puzzling. We\\npresent sensitive ALMA (Band~3) observations (at 3~mm) toward a sample of newly\\nidentified starless cores in the Orion Molecular Cloud. The spatially resolved\\nimages distinctly indicate that the observed CH$_3$OH and N$_2$H$^+$ emission\\nassociated with these cores are morphologically anti-correlated and\\nkinematically offset from each other. We postulate that the CH$_3$OH emission\\nhighlights the desorption of icy mantle by shocks resulting from gas piling\\nonto dense cores in the filaments traced by N$_2$H$^+$. Our magnetohydrodynamic\\n(MHD) simulations of star formation in turbulent clouds combined with radiative\\ntransfer calculations and imaging simulations successfully reproduced the\\nobserved signatures and reaffirmed the above scenario at work. Our result\\nserves as an intriguing and exemplary illustration, a snapshot in time, of the\\ndynamic star-forming processes in turbulent clouds. The results offer\\ncompelling insights into the mechanisms governing the growth of starless cores\\nand the presence of gas-phase complex organic molecules associated with these\\ncores.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T05:31:03Z\"}"}
