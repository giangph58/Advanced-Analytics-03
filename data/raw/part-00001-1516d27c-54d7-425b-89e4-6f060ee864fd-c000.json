To inherit the intrinsic characteristic of the original\\nsystem, the stochastic Lie--Trotter splitting method and the stochastic Strang\\nsplitting method are introduced, which are proved to preserve the positivity of\\nthe numerical solution and possess the discrete stochastic symplectic\\nconservation law as well. By deriving the uniform boundedness of the $p$-th\\nmoment of the numerical solution, we prove that the strong convergence orders\\nof these two methods are both one in the $L^2(\\\\Omega)$-norm. Finally, we\\nvalidate the theoretical results through two and four dimensional numerical\\nexamples.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T02:49:40Z\"}"}
