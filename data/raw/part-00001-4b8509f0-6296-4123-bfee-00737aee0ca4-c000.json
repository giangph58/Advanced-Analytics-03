{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19653v1\", \"title\": \"GAN-SLAM: Real-Time GAN Aided Floor Plan Creation Through SLAM\", \"summary\": \"SLAM is a fundamental component of modern autonomous systems, providing\\nrobots and their operators with a deeper understanding of their environment.\\nSLAM systems often encounter challenges due to the dynamic nature of robotic\\nmotion, leading to inaccuracies in mapping quality, particularly in 2D\\nrepresentations such as Occupancy Grid Maps. These errors can significantly\\ndegrade map quality, hindering the effectiveness of specific downstream tasks\\nsuch as floor plan creation. To address this challenge, we introduce our novel\\n'GAN-SLAM', a new SLAM approach that leverages Generative Adversarial Networks\\nto clean and complete occupancy grids during the SLAM process, reducing the\\nimpact of noise and inaccuracies introduced on the output map. We adapt and\\nintegrate accurate pose estimation techniques typically used for 3D SLAM into a\\n2D form. This enables the quality improvement 3D LiDAR-odometry has seen in\\nrecent years to be effective for 2D representations. Our results demonstrate\\nsubstantial improvements in map fidelity and quality, with minimal noise and\\nerrors, affirming the effectiveness of GAN-SLAM for real-world mapping\\napplications within large-scale complex environments. We validate our approach\\non real-world data operating in real-time, and on famous examples of 2D maps.\\nThe improved quality of the output map enables new downstream tasks, such as\\nfloor plan drafting, further enhancing the capabilities of autonomous systems.\\nOur novel approach to SLAM offers a significant step forward in the field,\\nimproving the usability for SLAM in mapping-based tasks, and offers insight\\ninto the usage of GANs for OGM error correction.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T10:13:38Z\"}"}
