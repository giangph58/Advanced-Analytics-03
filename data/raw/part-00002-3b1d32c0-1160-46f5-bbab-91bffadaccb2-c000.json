{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15904v1\", \"title\": \"Dimensional Uplift in Conformal Field Theories\", \"summary\": \"The n-point functions of any Conformal Field Theory (CFT) in $d$ dimensions\\ncan always be interpreted as spatial restrictions of corresponding functions in\\na higher-dimensional CFT with dimension $d'> d$. In particular, when a\\nfour-point function in $d$ dimensions has a known conformal block expansion,\\nthis expansion can be easily extended to $d'=d+2$ due to a remarkable identity\\namong conformal blocks, discovered by Kaviraj, Rychkov, and Trevisani (KRT) as\\na consequence of Parisi-Sourlas supersymmetry and confirmed to hold in any CFT\\nwith $d > 1$. In this note, we provide an elementary proof of this identity\\nusing simple algebraic properties of the Casimir operators. Additionally, we\\nconstruct five differential operators, $\\\\Lambda_i$, which promote a conformal\\nblock in $d$ dimensions to five conformal blocks in $d+2$ dimensions. These\\noperators can be normalized such that $\\\\sum_i \\\\Lambda_i = 1$, from which the\\nKRT identity immediately follows. Similar, simpler identities have been\\nproposed, all of which can be reformulated in the same way.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T13:44:16Z\"}"}
