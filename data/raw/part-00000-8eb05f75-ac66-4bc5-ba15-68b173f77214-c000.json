{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17629v1\", \"title\": \"Integrated Sensing and Communications for Unsourced Random Access: A\\n  Spectrum Sharing Compressive Sensing Approach\", \"summary\": \"This paper addresses the unsourced/uncoordinated random access problem in an\\nintegrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system, with a focus on uplink\\nmultiple access code design. Recent theoretical advancements highlight that an\\nISAC system will be overwhelmed by the increasing number of active devices,\\ndriven by the growth of massive machine-type communication (mMTC). To meet the\\ndemands of future mMTC network, fundamental solutions are required that ensure\\nrobust capacity while maintaining favorable energy and spectral efficiency. One\\npromising approach to support emerging massive connectivity is the development\\nof systems based on the unsourced ISAC (UNISAC) framework. This paper proposes\\na spectrum-sharing compressive sensing-based UNISAC (SSCS-UNISAC) and offers\\ninsights into the practical design of UNISAC multiple access codes. In this\\nframework, both communication signals (data transmission) and sensing signals\\n(e.g., radar echoes) overlap within finite channel uses and are transmitted via\\nthe proposed UNISAC protocol. The proposed decoder exhibits robust performance,\\nproviding 20-30 dB capacity gains compared to conventional protocols such as\\nTDMA and ALOHA. Numerical results validate the promising performance of the\\nproposed scheme.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:53:28Z\"}"}
