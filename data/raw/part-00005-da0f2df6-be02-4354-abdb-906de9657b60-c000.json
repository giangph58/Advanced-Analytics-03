{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01822v1\", \"title\": \"Track and Trace: Automatically Uncovering Cross-chain Transactions in\\n  the Multi-blockchain Ecosystems\", \"summary\": \"Cross-chain technology enables seamless asset transfer and message-passing\\nwithin decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems, facilitating multi-chain\\ncoexistence in the current blockchain environment. However, this development\\nalso raises security concerns, as malicious actors exploit cross-chain asset\\nflows to conceal the provenance and destination of assets, thereby facilitating\\nillegal activities such as money laundering. Consequently, the need for\\ncross-chain transaction traceability has become increasingly urgent. Prior\\nresearch on transaction traceability has predominantly focused on single-chain\\nand centralized finance (CeFi) cross-chain scenarios, overlooking DeFispecific\\nconsiderations. This paper proposes ABCTRACER, an automated, bi-directional\\ncross-chain transaction tracing tool, specifically designed for DeFi\\necosystems. By harnessing transaction event log mining and named entity\\nrecognition techniques, ABCTRACER automatically extracts explicit cross-chain\\ncues. These cues are then combined with information retrieval techniques to\\nencode implicit cues. ABCTRACER facilitates the autonomous learning of latent\\nassociated information and achieves bidirectional, generalized cross-chain\\ntransaction tracing. Our experiments on 12 mainstream cross-chain bridges\\ndemonstrate that ABCTRACER attains 91.75% bi-directional traceability (F1\\nmetrics) with self-adaptive capability. Furthermore, we apply ABCTRACER to\\nreal-world cross-chain attack transactions and money laundering traceability,\\nthereby bolstering the traceability and blockchain ecological security of DeFi\\nbridging applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE,cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:28:25Z\"}"}
