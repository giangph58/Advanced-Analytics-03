{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03641v1\", \"title\": \"Synthesizing Images on Perceptual Boundaries of ANNs for Uncovering and\\n  Manipulating Human Perceptual Variability\", \"summary\": \"Human decision-making in cognitive tasks and daily life exhibits considerable\\nvariability, shaped by factors such as task difficulty, individual preferences,\\nand personal experiences. Understanding this variability across individuals is\\nessential for uncovering the perceptual and decision-making mechanisms that\\nhumans rely on when faced with uncertainty and ambiguity. We present a\\ncomputational framework BAM (Boundary Alignment & Manipulation framework) that\\ncombines perceptual boundary sampling in ANNs and human behavioral experiments\\nto systematically investigate this phenomenon. Our perceptual boundary sampling\\nalgorithm generates stimuli along ANN decision boundaries that intrinsically\\ninduce significant perceptual variability. The efficacy of these stimuli is\\nempirically validated through large-scale behavioral experiments involving 246\\nparticipants across 116,715 trials, culminating in the variMNIST dataset\\ncontaining 19,943 systematically annotated images. Through personalized model\\nalignment and adversarial generation, we establish a reliable method for\\nsimultaneously predicting and manipulating the divergent perceptual decisions\\nof pairs of participants. This work bridges the gap between computational\\nmodels and human individual difference research, providing new tools for\\npersonalized perception analysis.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:44:42Z\"}"}
