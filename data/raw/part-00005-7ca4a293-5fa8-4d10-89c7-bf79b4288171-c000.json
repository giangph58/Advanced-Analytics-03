We applied noise to ground truth organ\\nsegmentations, and the autoencoders were tasked to denoise them. Through the\\napplication of our method to organ segmentations generated on both MR and CT\\nscans, we demonstrated that the method is independent of imaging modality. By\\nproviding reconstructions, our method offers visual information about\\ninaccurate regions of the organ segmentations, leading to more explainable\\ndetection of suboptimal segmentations. We compared our method to existing\\napproaches in the literature and demonstrated that it achieved superior\\nperformance for the majority of organs.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T15:53:40Z\"}"}
