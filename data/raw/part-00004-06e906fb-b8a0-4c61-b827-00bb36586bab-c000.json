Using a high-frequency identification approach, I\\nconstruct a novel \\\"election shock'' series, which captures exogenous surprises\\nin election probabilities. Aside from election outcomes, the largest shocks are\\nassociated with events that are orthogonal to innovations in the macroeconomy,\\ne.g., scandals and debates. These shocks have immediate effects on asset prices\\nin sectors that are differentially impacted by the policy platforms of the two\\nmajor U.S. political parties. In particular, shocks favoring Republican\\n(Democratic) candidates increase (decrease) the asset prices in the energy and\\ndefense sectors, while decreasing (increasing) prices in the clean energy\\nsector. These effects persist overtime.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T16:13:46Z\"}"}
