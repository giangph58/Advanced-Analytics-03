In addition, improving the accuracy at this current range\\nis also desirable for practical small-current measurements. However,\\nnanoampere-level currents have not yet been achieved with parallel pumps,\\nmainly due to challenges in optimizing operating conditions. Here, we propose a\\nscalable and easily implementable parallelization method based on\\ntunable-barrier single-electron pumps with split source electrodes. By tuning\\nthe source voltages, we successfully parallelize four single-electron pumps at\\n200 MHz and further demonstrate a current plateau exceeding 2 nA using three\\npumps at 2.1 GHz. The wide applicability of this parallelization technique\\nopens a path toward advancing high-accuracy quantum current standards.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T06:01:13Z\"}"}
