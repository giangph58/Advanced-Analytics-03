{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16470v1\", \"title\": \"Improved Streaming Edge Coloring\", \"summary\": \"Given a graph, an edge coloring assigns colors to edges so that no pairs of\\nadjacent edges share the same color. We are interested in edge coloring\\nalgorithms under the W-streaming model. In this model, the algorithm does not\\nhave enough memory to hold the entire graph, so the edges of the input graph\\nare read from a data stream one by one in an unknown order, and the algorithm\\nneeds to print a valid edge coloring in an output stream. The performance of\\nthe algorithm is measured by the amount of space and the number of different\\ncolors it uses.\\n  This streaming edge coloring problem has been studied by several works in\\nrecent years. When the input graph contains $n$ vertices and has maximum vertex\\ndegree $\\\\Delta$, it is known that in the W-streaming model, an\\n$O(\\\\Delta^2)$-edge coloring can be computed deterministically with\\n$\\\\tilde{O}(n)$ space [Ansari, Saneian, and Zarrabi-Zadeh, 2022], or an\\n$O(\\\\Delta^{1.5})$-edge coloring can be computed by a $\\\\tilde{O}(n)$-space\\nrandomized algorithm [Behnezhad, Saneian, 2024] [Chechik, Mukhtar, Zhang,\\n2024].\\n  In this paper, we achieve polynomial improvement over previous results.\\nSpecifically, we show how to improve the number of colors to\\n$\\\\tilde{O}(\\\\Delta^{4/3+\\\\epsilon})$ using space $\\\\tilde{O}(n)$\\ndeterministically, for any constant $\\\\epsilon > 0$. This is the first\\ndeterministic result that bypasses the quadratic bound on the number of colors\\nwhile using near-linear space.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T07:29:57Z\"}"}
