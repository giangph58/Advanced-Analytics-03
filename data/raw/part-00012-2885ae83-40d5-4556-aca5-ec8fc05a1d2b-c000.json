In the\\nliterature, the system is referred to as the Biot-Allard model. We recast the\\nmodel as a first-order system in time, where the memory effects are transformed\\ninto an auxiliary differential equation. This allows for a computationally\\nefficient numerical scheme. The system is discretized by continuous Galerkin\\nmethods in time and equal-order finite element methods in space. An optimal\\norder error estimate is proved for the norm of the first-order energy of the\\nunknowns of the system. The estimate is confirmed by numerical experiments.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T10:38:13Z\"}"}
