However, fairness and reliability concerns\\npersist, as hallucinations can emerge at both the retrieval and generation\\nstages, affecting users' reasoning and decision-making. Our research explores\\nhow tailored warning messages -- whose content depends on the specific context\\nof hallucination -- shape user reasoning and actions in an educational quiz\\nsetting. Preliminary findings suggest that while warnings improve accuracy and\\nawareness of high-level hallucinations, they may also introduce cognitive\\nfriction, leading to confusion and diminished trust in the system. By examining\\nthese interactions, this work contributes to the broader goal of AI-augmented\\nreasoning: developing systems that actively support human reflection, critical\\nthinking, and informed decision-making rather than passive information\\nconsumption.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T17:00:25Z\"}"}
