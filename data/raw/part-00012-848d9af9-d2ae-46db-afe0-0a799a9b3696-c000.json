In previous work, we proposed a\\nquantum imaging technique, in which variations in polarization angle due to\\nreflection or transmission at the sample enhance image contrast in the\\nsecond-order autocorrelation function at zero delay g2(0). However, the image\\nresolution observed was not satisfactory. In this report, to improve the image\\nquality, the parameters such as coincidence window was optimized to distinguish\\nphoton statistics effectively due to change in polarization angle and the\\nobjective lens was utilized to focus the entangled photon beams. These\\nmodifications enabled optical imaging by accurately detecting slight\\npolarization variations in different media. It is suggested that the proposed\\nmethod enables a superior imaging performance even in the presence of noise and\\nlow-power illumination requirement, offering new possibilities for high-quality\\nimaging applications.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T17:46:28Z\"}"}
