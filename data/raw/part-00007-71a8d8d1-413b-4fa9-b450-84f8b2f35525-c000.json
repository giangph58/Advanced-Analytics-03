Previous studies suggest that such\\nfluctuations in TDE may arise from the fallback of tidal disrupted debris. In\\nthis paper, we introduce the fluctuations of the mass distribution ${\\\\rm\\nd}M/{\\\\rm d}E$ for the debris ejected during the tidal disruption (with energy\\n$E$) and study their impact on jet power. Turbulence induced by tidal force and\\nthe self-gravity of the debris may imprint variabilities in ${\\\\rm d}M/{\\\\rm d}E$\\nduring fallback. We model these fluctuations with a power density spectrum\\n$\\\\propto f_{\\\\rm E}^{\\\\beta}$, where $f_{\\\\rm E} = 1/E$ and $\\\\beta$ is the\\npower-law index. We find that the resulting light curve can preserve the\\nfluctuation characteristics from ${\\\\rm d}M/{\\\\rm d}E$. In addition, the observed\\nfluctuations in the light-curves can be reproduced for a given suitable\\n$\\\\beta$. Based on the observations, we find that the value of $\\\\beta$ should be\\naround $-1$.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T03:37:48Z\"}"}
