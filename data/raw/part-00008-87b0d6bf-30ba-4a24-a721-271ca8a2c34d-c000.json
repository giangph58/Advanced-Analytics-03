Early engagement is vital for building interest\\nin computing careers and achieving equitable participation. Recent work has\\nshown that the use of sensor-enabled tools and block-based programming can\\nimprove engagement and self-efficacy for students from under-represented\\ngroups, but these findings lack replication in diverse, resource-constrained\\nsettings. This study addresses this gap by implementing sensor-based\\nprogramming workshops with rural students in Sri Lanka. Replicating methods\\nfrom the literature, we conduct a between-group study (sensor vs. non-sensor)\\nusing Scratch and real-time environmental sensors. We found that students in\\nboth groups reported significantly higher confidence in programming in Scratch\\nafter the workshop. In addition, average changes in both self-efficacy and\\noutcome expectancy were higher in the experimental (sensor) group than in the\\ncontrol (non-sensor) group, mirroring trends observed in the original study\\nbeing replicated. We also found that using the sensors helped to enhance\\ncreativity and inspired some students to express an interest in information and\\ncommunications technology (ICT) careers, supporting the value of such hands-on\\nactivities in building programming confidence among under-represented groups.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T09:47:41Z\"}"}
