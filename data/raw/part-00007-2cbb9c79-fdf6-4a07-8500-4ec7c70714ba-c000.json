{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17386v1\", \"title\": \"Free Cosmic Density Bispectrum on Small Scales\", \"summary\": \"We study the asymptotic behaviour of the free, cold-dark matter density\\nfluctuation bispectrum in the limit of small scales. From an initially Gaussian\\nrandom field, we draw phase-space positions of test particles which then\\npropagate along Zel'dovich trajectories. A suitable expansion of the initial\\nmomentum auto-correlations of these particles leads to an asymptotic series\\nwhose lower-order power-law exponents we calculate. The dominant contribution\\nhas an exponent of $-11/2$. For triangle configurations with zero surface area,\\nthis exponent is even enhanced to $-9/2$. These power laws can only be revealed\\nby a non-perturbative calculation with respect to the initial power spectrum.\\nThey are valid for a general class of initial power spectra with a cut-off\\nfunction, required to enforce convergence of its moments. We then confirm our\\nanalytic results numerically. Finally, we use this asymptotic behaviour to\\ninvestigate the shape dependence of the bispectrum in the small-scale limit,\\nand to show how different shapes grow over cosmic time. These confirm the usual\\nmodel of gravitational collapse within the Zel'dovich picture.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T09:12:51Z\"}"}
