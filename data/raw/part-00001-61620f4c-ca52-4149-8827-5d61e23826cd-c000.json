In a non-targeted trial both sick\\nand healthy subjects may be treated, producing heterogeneous effects within the\\ntreated group. Inferring the correct treatment effect on the sick population is\\nthen difficult, because the effects on the different groups get tangled. We\\npropose an efficient nonparametric approach to estimating the group effects,\\ncalled {\\\\bf PCM} (pre-cluster and merge). We prove its asymptotic consistency\\nin a general setting and show, on synthetic data, more than a 10x improvement\\nin accuracy over existing state-of-the-art. Our approach applies more generally\\nto consistent estimation of functions with a finite range.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T12:51:07Z\"}"}
