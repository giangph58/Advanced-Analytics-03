We use a generalized version of chip firing to bound the\\nnumber of invariant factors of the critical group of an arithmetical structure\\non a graph. We also show that, under appropriate hypotheses, critical groups\\nare additive under wedge sums of graphs with arithmetical structures. We apply\\nthese results to relate the number of invariant factors of critical groups\\nassociated to any given tree to decompositions of the tree into simpler trees.\\nWe use this to classify those trees for which every arithmetical structure has\\ncyclic critical group. Finally, we show how to construct arithmetical\\nstructures on trees with prescribed critical groups. In particular, every\\nfinite abelian group is realized as the critical group of some arithmetical\\nstructure on a tree.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T16:27:32Z\"}"}
