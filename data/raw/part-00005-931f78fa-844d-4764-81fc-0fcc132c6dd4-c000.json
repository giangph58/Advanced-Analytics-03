{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16446v1\", \"title\": \"Mumott -- a Python package for the analysis of multi-modal tensor\\n  tomography data\", \"summary\": \"Small and wide angle x-ray scattering tensor tomography are powerful methods\\nfor studying anisotropic nanostructures in a volume-resolved manner, and are\\nbecoming increasingly available to users of synchrotron facilities. The\\nanalysis of such experiments requires, however, advanced procedures and\\nalgorithms, which creates a barrier for the wider adoption of these techniques.\\nHere, in response to this challenge, we introduce the mumott package. It is\\nwritten in Python with computationally demanding tasks handled via just-in-time\\ncompilation using both CPU and GPU resources. The package is being developed\\nwith a focus on usability and extensibility, while achieving a high\\ncomputational efficiency. Following a short introduction to the common\\nworkflow, we review key features, outline the underlying object-oriented\\nframework, and demonstrate the computational performance. By developing the\\nmumott package and making it generally available, we hope to lower the\\nthreshold for the adoption of tensor tomography and to make these techniques\\naccessible to a larger research community.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T06:15:11Z\"}"}
