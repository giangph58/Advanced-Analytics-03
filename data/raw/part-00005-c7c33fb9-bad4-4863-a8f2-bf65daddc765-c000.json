The model\\naims to minimize total evacuation cost by integrating pedestrian speed, route\\nlength, and effort, while also selecting the optimal number and position of\\nshelters. A modified minimum cost flow formulation is used to capture complex\\nhydrodynamic and behavioral conditions within a directed street network. The\\nevacuation problem is modeled through an extended graph representing the urban\\nstreet network, where nodes and links simulate paths and shelters, including\\nincomplete evacuations (deadly nodes), enabling accurate representation of\\nreal-world constraints and network dynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T14:04:50Z\"}"}
