A single vehicle is in charge for all pick-up and\\ndrop-off operations, and the solution cost is associated with its route, which\\nmust also be decided. We provide a general and flexible mathematical\\noptimization based approach for solving the problem that has some peculiarities\\nto assure that the demand is adequately picked up, that some pickup points can\\nbe visited multiple times, that the capacity of the vehicle is respected, or\\nthat the vehicle is capable to implement the path or tour in the obtained\\nsolution. We report the results of a extense battery of experiments to validate\\nour proposal on synthetic instances, and provide some insighs on the usefulness\\nof our approach in practical applications.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T17:07:43Z\"}"}
