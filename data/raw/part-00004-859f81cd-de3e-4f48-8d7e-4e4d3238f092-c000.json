{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15841v1\", \"title\": \"Quantum Discrete Variable Representations\", \"summary\": \"We present a fault-tolerant quantum algorithm for implementing the Discrete\\nVariable Representation (DVR) transformation, a technique widely used in\\nsimulations of quantum-mechanical Hamiltonians. DVR provides a diagonal\\nrepresentation of local operators and enables sparse Hamiltonian structures,\\nmaking it a powerful alternative to the finite basis representation (FBR),\\nparticularly in high-dimensional problems. While DVR has been extensively used\\nin classical simulations, its quantum implementation, particularly using\\nGaussian quadrature grids, remains underexplored. We develop a quantum circuit\\nthat efficiently transforms FBR into DVR by following a recursive construction\\nbased on quantum arithmetic operations, and we compare this approach with\\nmethods that directly load DVR matrix elements using quantum read-only memory\\n(QROM). We analyze the quantum resources, including T-gate and qubit counts,\\nrequired for implementing the DVR unitary and discuss preferable choices of\\nQROM-based and recursive-based methods for a given matrix size and precision.\\nThis study lays the groundwork for utilizing DVR Hamiltonians in quantum\\nalgorithms such as quantum phase estimation with block encoding.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.chem-ph,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T12:35:25Z\"}"}
