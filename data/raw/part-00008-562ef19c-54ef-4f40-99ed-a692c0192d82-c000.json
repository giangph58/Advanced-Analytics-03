However, the necessity of complex\\nnumbers--as opposed to their mere convenience--remains a subject of debate.\\nSeveral alternative formulations of quantum mechanics using real numbers have\\nbeen proposed. In this paper, we demonstrate that standard quantum mechanics,\\nformulated in a complex Hilbert space, admits an equivalent reformulation in a\\nreal Kahler space. By establishing a natural isomorphism between the operator\\ntheories of the complex Hilbert space and the real Kahler space, we prove the\\nequivalence of the two formulations including composite system.\\n  This Kahler-space framework preserves all essential features of quantum\\nmechanics while offering a key advantage: it inherently incorporates a\\nHamiltonian symplectic structure analogous to classical mechanics. This\\nstructural alignment provides a unified geometric perspective for both\\nclassical and quantum dynamics. Additionally, we show that the ergodicity of\\nfinite-dimensional quantum systems becomes manifest in this framework,\\nresolving interpretational ambiguities present in conventional complex\\nformulations.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T16:01:25Z\"}"}
