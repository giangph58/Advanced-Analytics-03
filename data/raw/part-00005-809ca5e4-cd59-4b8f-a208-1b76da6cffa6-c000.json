Variable-pitch propeller (VPP) MAVs offer\\ngreater agility, yet their complex dynamics complicate the sim-to-real\\ntransfer. This paper introduces a novel RL framework to overcome these\\nchallenges, enabling VPP MAVs to perform advanced aerial maneuvers in\\nreal-world settings. Our approach includes real-to-sim transfer techniques-such\\nas system identification, domain randomization, and curriculum learning to\\ncreate robust training simulations and a sim-to-real transfer strategy\\ncombining a cascade control system with a fast-response low-level controller\\nfor reliable deployment. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of this\\nframework in achieving zero-shot deployment, enabling MAVs to perform complex\\nmaneuvers such as flips and wall-backtracking.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T12:27:59Z\"}"}
