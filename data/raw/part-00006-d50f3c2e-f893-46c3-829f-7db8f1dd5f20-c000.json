{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15108v1\", \"title\": \"Unwarping Screen Content Images via Structure-texture Enhancement\\n  Network and Transformation Self-estimation\", \"summary\": \"While existing implicit neural network-based image unwarping methods perform\\nwell on natural images, they struggle to handle screen content images (SCIs),\\nwhich often contain large geometric distortions, text, symbols, and sharp\\nedges. To address this, we propose a structure-texture enhancement network\\n(STEN) with transformation self-estimation for SCI warping. STEN integrates a\\nB-spline implicit neural representation module and a transformation error\\nestimation and self-correction algorithm. It comprises two branches: the\\nstructure estimation branch (SEB), which enhances local aggregation and global\\ndependency modeling, and the texture estimation branch (TEB), which improves\\ntexture detail synthesis using B-spline implicit neural representation.\\nAdditionally, the transformation self-estimation module autonomously estimates\\nthe transformation error and corrects the coordinate transformation matrix,\\neffectively handling real-world image distortions. Extensive experiments on\\npublic SCI datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms\\nstate-of-the-art methods. Comparisons on well-known natural image datasets also\\nshow the potential of our approach for natural image distortion.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T13:59:44Z\"}"}
