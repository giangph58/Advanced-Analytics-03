{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15158v1\", \"title\": \"Interacting Copies of Random Constraint Satisfaction Problems\", \"summary\": \"We study a system of $y=2$ coupled copies of a well-known constraint\\nsatisfaction problem (random hypergraph bicoloring) to examine how the\\nferromagnetic coupling between the copies affects the properties of the\\nsolution space. We solve the replicated model by applying the cavity method to\\nthe supervariables taking $2^y$ values. Our results show that a coupling of\\nstrength $\\\\gamma$ between the copies decreases the clustering threshold\\n$\\\\alpha_d(\\\\gamma)$, at which typical solutions shatters into disconnected\\ncomponents, therefore preventing numerical methods such as Monte Carlo Markov\\nChains from reaching equilibrium in polynomial time. This result needs to be\\nreconciled with the observation that, in models with coupled copies, denser\\nregions of the solution space should be more accessible. Additionally, we\\nobserve a change in the nature of the clustering phase transition, from\\ndiscontinuous to continuous, in a wide $\\\\gamma$ range. We investigate how the\\ncoupling affects the behavior of the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm on\\nfinite-size instances and find that BP convergence is significantly impacted by\\nthe continuous transition. These results highlight the importance of better\\nunderstanding algorithmic performance at the clustering transition, and call\\nfor a further exploration into the optimal use of re-weighting strategies\\ndesigned to enhance algorithmic performances.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T15:05:18Z\"}"}
