In this study, we present a comprehensive deep\\nlearning framework for multiscale building segmentation using RGB aerial and\\nsatellite imagery with spatial resolutions ranging from 0.4m to 2.7m. We curate\\na diverse, multi-sensor dataset and introduce feature-augmented inputs by\\nderiving secondary representations including Principal Component Analysis\\n(PCA), Visible Difference Vegetation Index (VDVI), Morphological Building Index\\n(MBI), and Sobel edge filters from RGB channels. These features guide a\\nRes-U-Net architecture in learning complex spatial patterns more effectively.\\nWe also propose training policies incorporating layer freezing, cyclical\\nlearning rates, and SuperConvergence to reduce training time and resource\\nusage. Evaluated on a held-out WorldView-3 image, our model achieves an overall\\naccuracy of 96.5%, an F1-score of 0.86, and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of\\n0.80, outperforming existing RGB-based benchmarks. This study demonstrates the\\neffectiveness of combining multi-resolution imagery, feature augmentation, and\\noptimized training strategies for robust building segmentation in remote\\nsensing applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:08:36Z\"}"}
