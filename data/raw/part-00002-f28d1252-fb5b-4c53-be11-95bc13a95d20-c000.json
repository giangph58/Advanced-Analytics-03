{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10102v1\", \"title\": \"A Human-Sensitive Controller: Adapting to Human Ergonomics and Physical\\n  Constraints via Reinforcement Learning\", \"summary\": \"Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders continue to be a major challenge in\\nindustrial environments, leading to reduced workforce participation, increased\\nhealthcare costs, and long-term disability. This study introduces a\\nhuman-sensitive robotic system aimed at reintegrating individuals with a\\nhistory of musculoskeletal disorders into standard job roles, while\\nsimultaneously optimizing ergonomic conditions for the broader workforce. This\\nresearch leverages reinforcement learning to develop a human-aware control\\nstrategy for collaborative robots, focusing on optimizing ergonomic conditions\\nand preventing pain during task execution. Two RL approaches, Q-Learning and\\nDeep Q-Network (DQN), were implemented and tested to personalize control\\nstrategies based on individual user characteristics. Although experimental\\nresults revealed a simulation-to-real gap, a fine-tuning phase successfully\\nadapted the policies to real-world conditions. DQN outperformed Q-Learning by\\ncompleting tasks faster while maintaining zero pain risk and safe ergonomic\\nlevels. The structured testing protocol confirmed the system's adaptability to\\ndiverse human anthropometries, underscoring the potential of RL-driven cobots\\nto enable safer, more inclusive workplaces.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T11:09:43Z\"}"}
