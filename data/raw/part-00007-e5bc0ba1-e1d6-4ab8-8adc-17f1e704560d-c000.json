While an existing method for egocentric\\nwhole-body (i.e., body and hands) motion estimation is non-real-time and\\nacausal due to diffusion-based iterative motion refinement to capture\\ncorrelations between body and hand poses, REWIND operates in a fully causal and\\nreal-time manner. To enable real-time inference, we introduce (1) cascaded\\nbody-hand denoising diffusion, which effectively models the correlation between\\negocentric body and hand motions in a fast, feed-forward manner, and (2)\\ndiffusion distillation, which enables high-quality motion estimation with a\\nsingle denoising step. Our denoising diffusion model is based on a modified\\nTransformer architecture, designed to causally model output motions while\\nenhancing generalizability to unseen motion lengths. Additionally, REWIND\\noptionally supports identity-conditioned motion estimation when identity prior\\nis available. To this end, we propose a novel identity conditioning method\\nbased on a small set of pose exemplars of the target identity, which further\\nenhances motion estimation quality. Through extensive experiments, we\\ndemonstrate that REWIND significantly outperforms the existing baselines both\\nwith and without exemplar-based identity conditioning.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GR\", \"categories\": \"cs.GR,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:44:11Z\"}"}
