The model\\nexplains the fermion mass hierarchy through the non-universality of the extra\\ngauge symmetry and by an additional $\\\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ discrete symmetry, where\\nthe heaviest fermions acquire their masses from two different scales determined\\nby two Higgs doublets and one singlet, whereas the lightest fermions obtain\\ntheir masses from radiative corrections. From cancellation of chiral anomalies,\\nthe model also includes heavy extra fermions, both charged and neutral. The\\nlatter are right-handed neutrinos that acquire masses via an inverse see-saw\\nmechanism, reproducing the observed squared mass differences for the active\\nneutrinos. Using the latest lattice calculation of the leading hadronic vacuum\\npolarization (HVP) contribution to the muon $g-2$, we compute the dominant\\none-loop diagrams mediated by the $W$ and charged Higgs bosons, both with a\\nheavy Majorana neutrino in the loop, setting bounds for masses of the new\\nparticles. We also provide predictions for observables that can probe our model\\nin the future such as charged lepton flavor violating searches at Belle II like\\n$\\\\tau\\\\to \\\\mu\\\\gamma$, $\\\\tau\\\\to e\\\\gamma$ and at MEG II for $\\\\mu\\\\to e\\\\gamma$.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:05:23Z\"}"}
