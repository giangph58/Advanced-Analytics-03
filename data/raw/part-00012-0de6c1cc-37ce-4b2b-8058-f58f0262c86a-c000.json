{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13162v1\", \"title\": \"Personalized Text-to-Image Generation with Auto-Regressive Models\", \"summary\": \"Personalized image synthesis has emerged as a pivotal application in\\ntext-to-image generation, enabling the creation of images featuring specific\\nsubjects in diverse contexts. While diffusion models have dominated this\\ndomain, auto-regressive models, with their unified architecture for text and\\nimage modeling, remain underexplored for personalized image generation. This\\npaper investigates the potential of optimizing auto-regressive models for\\npersonalized image synthesis, leveraging their inherent multimodal capabilities\\nto perform this task. We propose a two-stage training strategy that combines\\noptimization of text embeddings and fine-tuning of transformer layers. Our\\nexperiments on the auto-regressive model demonstrate that this method achieves\\ncomparable subject fidelity and prompt following to the leading diffusion-based\\npersonalization methods. The results highlight the effectiveness of\\nauto-regressive models in personalized image generation, offering a new\\ndirection for future research in this area.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:58:26Z\"}"}
