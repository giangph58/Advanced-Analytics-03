In AI-augmented reasoning, interventions that disrupt the state of\\ncognitive flow can hinder rather than enhance decision-making. This paper\\nproposes a context-aware cognitive augmentation framework that adapts\\ninterventions based on three key contextual factors: type, timing, and scale.\\nBy leveraging multimodal behavioral cues (e.g., gaze behavior, typing\\nhesitation, interaction speed), AI can dynamically adjust cognitive support to\\nmaintain or restore flow. We introduce the concept of cognitive flow, an\\nextension of flow theory in AI-augmented reasoning, where interventions are\\npersonalized, adaptive, and minimally intrusive. By shifting from static\\ninterventions to context-aware augmentation, our approach ensures that AI\\nsystems support deep engagement in complex decision-making and reasoning\\nwithout disrupting cognitive immersion.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T16:35:39Z\"}"}
