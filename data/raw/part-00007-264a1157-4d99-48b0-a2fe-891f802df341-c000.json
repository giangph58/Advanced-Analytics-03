Drawing parallels with single-particle flat-band localization and\\nAharonov-Bohm cages, we identify conditions under which similar interference\\neffects in the many-body domain produce Fock space cages (FSCs)-highly\\nlocalized many-body eigenstates. By interpreting Fock space as a graph where\\nnodes represent bitstring basis states and edges denote non-zero transition\\namplitudes of the Hamiltonian, we analyze different kinetically constrained\\nmodels. The FSCs cause non-ergodic dynamics when the system is initialized\\nwithin their support, highlighting a universal interference-driven localization\\nmechanism in many-body systems.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:56:25Z\"}"}
