This\\nphenomenon occurs when an idle FaaS function is invoked, requiring a full\\ninitialization process, which increases latency and degrades user experience.\\nExisting solutions for cold start mitigation are limited in terms of invocation\\npattern generalization and implementation complexity. In this study, we propose\\nan innovative approach leveraging Transformer models to mitigate the impact of\\ncold starts in FaaS architectures. Our solution excels in accurately modeling\\nfunction initialization delays and optimizing serverless system performance.\\nExperimental evaluation using a public dataset provided by Azure demonstrates a\\nsignificant reduction in cold start times, reaching up to 79\\\\% compared to\\nconventional methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:12:07Z\"}"}
