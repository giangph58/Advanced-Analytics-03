{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16383v1\", \"title\": \"Fast and Modular Whole-Body Lagrangian Dynamics of Legged Robots with\\n  Changing Morphology\", \"summary\": \"Fast and modular modeling of multi-legged robots (MLRs) is essential for\\nresilient control, particularly under significant morphological changes caused\\nby mechanical damage. Conventional fixed-structure models, often developed with\\nsimplifying assumptions for nominal gaits, lack the flexibility to adapt to\\nsuch scenarios. To address this, we propose a fast modular whole-body modeling\\nframework using Boltzmann-Hamel equations and screw theory, in which each leg's\\ndynamics is modeled independently and assembled based on the current robot\\nmorphology. This singularity-free, closed-form formulation enables efficient\\ndesign of model-based controllers and damage identification algorithms. Its\\nmodularity allows autonomous adaptation to various damage configurations\\nwithout manual re-derivation or retraining of neural networks. We validate the\\nproposed framework using a custom simulation engine that integrates contact\\ndynamics, a gait generator, and local leg control. Comparative simulations\\nagainst hardware tests on a hexapod robot with multiple leg damage confirm the\\nmodel's accuracy and adaptability. Additionally, runtime analyses reveal that\\nthe proposed model is approximately three times faster than real-time, making\\nit suitable for real-time applications in damage identification and recovery.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,nlin.AO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T03:24:57Z\"}"}
