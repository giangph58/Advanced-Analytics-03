{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16504v1\", \"title\": \"Intelligent Depression Prevention via LLM-Based Dialogue Analysis:\\n  Overcoming the Limitations of Scale-Dependent Diagnosis through Precise\\n  Emotional Pattern Recognition\", \"summary\": \"Existing depression screening predominantly relies on standardized\\nquestionnaires (e.g., PHQ-9, BDI), which suffer from high misdiagnosis rates\\n(18-34% in clinical studies) due to their static, symptom-counting nature and\\nsusceptibility to patient recall bias. This paper presents an AI-powered\\ndepression prevention system that leverages large language models (LLMs) to\\nanalyze real-time conversational cues--including subtle emotional expressions\\n(e.g., micro-sentiment shifts, self-referential language patterns)--for more\\naccurate and dynamic mental state assessment. Our system achieves three key\\ninnovations: (1) Continuous monitoring through natural dialogue, detecting\\ndepression-indicative linguistic features (anhedonia markers, hopelessness\\nsemantics) with 89% precision (vs. 72% for PHQ-9); (2) Adaptive risk\\nstratification that updates severity levels based on conversational context,\\nreducing false positives by 41% compared to scale-based thresholds; and (3)\\nPersonalized intervention strategies tailored to users' emotional granularity,\\ndemonstrating 2.3x higher adherence rates than generic advice. Clinical\\nvalidation with 450 participants shows the system identifies 92% of at-risk\\ncases missed by traditional scales, while its explainable AI interface bridges\\nthe gap between automated analysis and clinician judgment. This work\\nestablishes conversational AI as a paradigm shift from episodic scale-dependent\\ndiagnosis to continuous, emotionally intelligent mental health monitoring.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.NC\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.NC,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T08:31:51Z\"}"}
