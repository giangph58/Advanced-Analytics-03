Here we take the machine learning weather model\\nACE2, trained to predict 6-hourly steps in atmospheric evolution and which can\\nremain stable over long forecast periods, and assess it from a seasonal\\nforecasting perspective. Applying persisted sea surface temperature (SST) and\\nsea-ice anomalies centred on 1st November each year, we initialise a lagged\\nensemble of winter predictions covering 1993/1994 to 2015/2016. Over this\\n23-year period there is remarkable similarity in the patterns of predictability\\nwith a leading physics-based model. The ACE2 model exhibits skilful predictions\\nof the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) with a correlation score of 0.47\\n(p=0.02), as well as a realistic global distribution of skill and ensemble\\nspread. Surprisingly, ACE2 is found to exhibit a signal-to-noise error as seen\\nin physics-based models, in which it is better at predicting the real world\\nthan itself. Examining predictions of winter 2009/2010 indicates potential\\nlimitations of ACE2 in capturing extreme seasonal conditions that extend\\noutside the training data. Nevertheless, this study reveals that machine\\nlearning weather models can produce skilful global seasonal predictions and\\nheralds a new era of increased understanding, development and generation of\\nnear-term climate predictions.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T11:11:16Z\"}"}
