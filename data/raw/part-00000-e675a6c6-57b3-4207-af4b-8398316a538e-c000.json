In this work, we\\ndevelop confidence regions for spatial excursion sets above and below a given\\nlevel. We achieve this by treating the confidence procedure as a testing\\nproblem at the given level, allowing control of the False Discovery Rate (FDR).\\nMethods are developed to control the FDR, separately for positive and negative\\nexcursions, as well as jointly over both. Furthermore, power is increased by\\nincorporating a two-stage adaptive procedure. Simulation results with various\\nsignals show that our confidence regions successfully control the FDR under the\\nnominal level. We showcase our methods with an application to functional\\nmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the Human Connectome Project\\nillustrating the improvement in statistical power over existing approaches.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:41:05Z\"}"}
