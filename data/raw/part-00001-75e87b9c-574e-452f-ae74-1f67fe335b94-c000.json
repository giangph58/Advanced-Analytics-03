{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05298v1\", \"title\": \"Toward Reasonable Parrots: Why Large Language Models Should Argue with\\n  Us by Design\", \"summary\": \"In this position paper, we advocate for the development of conversational\\ntechnology that is inherently designed to support and facilitate argumentative\\nprocesses. We argue that, at present, large language models (LLMs) are\\ninadequate for this purpose, and we propose an ideal technology design aimed at\\nenhancing argumentative skills. This involves re-framing LLMs as tools to\\nexercise our critical thinking rather than replacing them. We introduce the\\nconcept of 'reasonable parrots' that embody the fundamental principles of\\nrelevance, responsibility, and freedom, and that interact through argumentative\\ndialogical moves. These principles and moves arise out of millennia of work in\\nargumentation theory and should serve as the starting point for LLM-based\\ntechnology that incorporates basic principles of argumentation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.MA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:41:07Z\"}"}
