{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11210v1\", \"title\": \"Differentiating Formation Models with New Dynamical Masses for the PDS\\n  70 Protoplanets\", \"summary\": \"Hot- and cold-start planet formation models predict differing luminosities\\nfor the young, bright planets that direct imaging surveys are most sensitive\\nto. However, precise mass estimates are required to distinguish between these\\nmodels observationally. The presence of two directly imaged planets, PDS 70 b\\nand c, in the PDS 70 protoplanetary disk provides us a unique opportunity for\\ndynamical mass measurements, since the masses for these planets are currently\\npoorly constrained. Fitting orbital parameters to new astrometry of these\\nplanets, taken with VLTI/GRAVITY in the $K$~band, we find $2\\\\sigma$ dynamical\\nupper mass limits of 4.9 $M_{\\\\rm Jup}$ for b and 13.6 $M_{\\\\rm Jup}$ for c.\\nAdding astrometry from the newly proposed planet candidate PDS 70 d into our\\nmodel, we determine $2\\\\sigma$ dynamical upper mass limits of 5.3 $M_{\\\\rm Jup}$,\\n7.5 $M_{\\\\rm Jup}$ and 2.2 $M_{\\\\rm Jup}$ for b, c, and the candidate d\\nrespectively. However, $N$-body analysis of the orbits fit in this case suggest\\nthat the inclusion of $d$ makes the system unstable. Using the upper mass\\nlimits for b and c we rule out the coldest-start formation models for both\\nplanets, calculating minimum post-formation entropies ($S_i$) of 9.5 $k_{\\\\rm\\nB}/{\\\\rm baryon}$ and 8.4 $k_{\\\\rm B}/{\\\\rm baryon}$ respectively. This places PDS\\n70 b and c on the growing list of directly-imaged planets inconsistent with\\ncold-start formation.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:12:38Z\"}"}
