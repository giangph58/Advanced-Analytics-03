{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10095v1\", \"title\": \"Influence of packing protocol on fractal exponents in dense polydisperse\\n  packings\", \"summary\": \"We study fractal properties of a system of densely and randomly packed disks,\\nobeying a power-law distribution of radii, which is generated by using various\\nprotocols: Delaunay triangulation (DT) with both zero and periodic boundary\\nconditions and the constant pressure protocol with periodic boundary\\nconditions. The power-law exponents of the mass-radius relation and structure\\nfactor are obtained numerically for various values of the size ratio of the\\ndistribution, defined as the largest-to-smallest radius ratio. It is shown that\\nthe size ratio is an important control parameter responsible for the\\nconsistency of the fractal properties of the system: the greater the ratio, the\\nless the finite size effects are pronounced and the better the agreement\\nbetween the exponents. For the DT protocol, the exponents of the mass-radius\\nrelation, structure factor, and power-law distribution coincide even at\\nmoderate values of the size ratio. By contrast, for the constant-pressure\\nprotocol, all three exponents are found to be different for both moderate\\n(around 300) and large (around 1500) size ratios, which might indicate a biased\\nrather than random spatial distribution of the disks. Nevertheless, there is a\\ntendency for the exponents to converge as the size ratio increases, suggesting\\nthat all the exponents become equal in the limit of infinite size ratio.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T11:01:39Z\"}"}
