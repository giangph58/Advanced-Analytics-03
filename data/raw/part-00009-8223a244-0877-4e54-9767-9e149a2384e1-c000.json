If controlled by platform companies -- either those that already\\ndominate online search, communication, and commerce, or those vying to replace\\nthem -- platform agents could intensify surveillance, exacerbate user lock-in,\\nand further entrench the incumbent digital giants. This position paper argues\\nthat to resist the undesirable effects of platform agents, we should champion\\nagent advocates -- agents that are controlled by users, serve the interests of\\nusers, and preserve user autonomy and choice. We identify key interventions to\\nenable agent advocates: ensuring public access to compute, developing\\ninteroperability protocols and safety standards, and implementing appropriate\\nmarket regulations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T11:45:38Z\"}"}
