A central limit theorem and a\\nmoderate deviation principle of the additive functional of the process are\\nproved, which include the CLT and the MDP of the occupation time as special\\ncases. A graphical representation of the SSEP plays the key role in proofs of\\nthe main results, by which we can extend the martingale decomposition formula\\nintroduced in Kipnis (1987) for the occupation time to the case of general\\nadditive functionals.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T04:40:28Z\"}"}
