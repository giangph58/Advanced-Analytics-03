{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23882v1\", \"title\": \"GLane3D : Detecting Lanes with Graph of 3D Keypoints\", \"summary\": \"Accurate and efficient lane detection in 3D space is essential for autonomous\\ndriving systems, where robust generalization is the foremost requirement for 3D\\nlane detection algorithms. Considering the extensive variation in lane\\nstructures worldwide, achieving high generalization capacity is particularly\\nchallenging, as algorithms must accurately identify a wide variety of lane\\npatterns worldwide. Traditional top-down approaches rely heavily on learning\\nlane characteristics from training datasets, often struggling with lanes\\nexhibiting previously unseen attributes. To address this generalization\\nlimitation, we propose a method that detects keypoints of lanes and\\nsubsequently predicts sequential connections between them to construct complete\\n3D lanes. Each key point is essential for maintaining lane continuity, and we\\npredict multiple proposals per keypoint by allowing adjacent grids to predict\\nthe same keypoint using an offset mechanism. PointNMS is employed to eliminate\\noverlapping proposal keypoints, reducing redundancy in the estimated BEV graph\\nand minimizing computational overhead from connection estimations. Our model\\nsurpasses previous state-of-the-art methods on both the Apollo and OpenLane\\ndatasets, demonstrating superior F1 scores and a strong generalization capacity\\nwhen models trained on OpenLane are evaluated on the Apollo dataset, compared\\nto prior approaches.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T09:33:26Z\"}"}
