AI planning literature has reported\\nseveral research efforts on generating explanations of solutions to planning\\nproblems. However, explaining the unsolvability of planning problems remains a\\nlargely open and understudied problem. A widely practiced approach to plan\\ngeneration and automated problem solving, in general, is to decompose tasks\\ninto sub-problems that help progressively converge towards the goal. In this\\npaper, we propose to adopt the same philosophy of sub-problem identification as\\na mechanism for analyzing and explaining unsolvability of planning problems in\\nhybrid systems. In particular, for a given unsolvable planning problem, we\\npropose to identify common waypoints, which are universal obstacles to plan\\nexistence; in other words, they appear on every plan from the source to the\\nplanning goal. This work envisions such waypoints as sub-problems of the\\nplanning problem and the unreachability of any of these waypoints as an\\nexplanation for the unsolvability of the original planning problem. We propose\\na novel method of waypoint identification by casting the problem as an instance\\nof the longest common subsequence problem, a widely popular problem in computer\\nscience, typically considered as an illustrative example for the dynamic\\nprogramming paradigm. Once the waypoints are identified, we perform symbolic\\nreachability analysis on them to identify the earliest unreachable waypoint and\\nreport it as the explanation of unsolvability. We present experimental results\\non unsolvable planning problems in hybrid domains.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.FL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T07:45:30Z\"}"}
