Vulnerable road users\\n(VRUs), such as pedestrians, are vastly overrepresented in the worldwide TBI\\nstatistics. To evaluate the effectiveness of injury prevention measures,\\nresearchers often employ Finite Element (FE) models of the human body to\\nvirtually simulate the human response to impact in real-world road traffic\\naccident scenarios. However, VRU accidents occur in a highly uncontrolled\\nenvironment and, in consequence, there is a large amount of variables\\n(covariates), e.g. the vehicle impact speed and VRU body posture, that together\\ndictate the injurious outcome of the collision. At the same time, since FE\\nanalysis is a computationally heavy task, researchers often need to apply\\nextensive simplifications to FE models when attempting to predict real-world\\nVRU head trauma. To help researchers make informed decisions when conducting FE\\naccident reconstructions, this literature review aims to create an overarching\\nsummary of covariates that have been reported influential in literature. The\\nreview provides researchers with an overview of variables proven to have an\\ninfluence on head injury predictions. The material could potentially be useful\\nas a basis for choosing parameters to include when performing sensitivity\\nanalyses of car-to-pedestrian impact simulations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T14:48:06Z\"}"}
