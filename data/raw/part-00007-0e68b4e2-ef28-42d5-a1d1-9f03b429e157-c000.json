{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16752v1\", \"title\": \"Adversarial Knapsack for Sequential Competitive Resource Allocation\", \"summary\": \"This work addresses competitive resource allocation in a sequential setting,\\nwhere two players allocate resources across objects or locations of shared\\ninterest. Departing from the simultaneous Colonel Blotto game, our framework\\nintroduces a sequential decision-making dynamic, where players act with partial\\nor complete knowledge of previous moves. Unlike traditional approaches that\\nrely on complex mixed strategies, we focus on deterministic pure strategies,\\nstreamlining computation while preserving strategic depth. Additionally, we\\nextend the payoff structure to accommodate fractional allocations and payoffs,\\nmoving beyond the binary, all-or-nothing paradigm to allow more granular\\noutcomes. We model this problem as an adversarial knapsack game, formulating it\\nas a bilevel optimization problem that integrates the leader's objective with\\nthe follower's best-response. This knapsack-based approach is novel in the\\ncontext of competitive resource allocation, with prior work only partially\\nleveraging it for follower analysis. Our contributions include: (1) proposing\\nan adversarial knapsack formulation for the sequential resource allocation\\nproblem, (2) developing efficient heuristics for fractional allocation\\nscenarios, and (3) analyzing the 0-1 knapsack case, providing a computational\\nhardness result alongside a heuristic solution.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GT\", \"categories\": \"cs.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T14:24:17Z\"}"}
