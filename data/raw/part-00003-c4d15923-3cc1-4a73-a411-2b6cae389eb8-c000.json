{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16436v1\", \"title\": \"Towards a fast and robust deep hedging approach\", \"summary\": \"We present a robust Deep Hedging framework for the pricing and hedging of\\noption portfolios that significantly improves training efficiency and model\\nrobustness. In particular, we propose a neural model for training model\\nembeddings which utilizes the paths of several advanced equity option models\\nwith stochastic volatility in order to learn the relationships that exist\\nbetween hedging strategies. A key advantage of the proposed method is its\\nability to rapidly and reliably adapt to new market regimes through the\\nrecalibration of a low-dimensional embedding vector, rather than retraining the\\nentire network. Moreover, we examine the observed Profit and Loss distributions\\non the parameter space of the models used to learn the embeddings. The results\\nshow that the proposed framework works well with data generated by complex\\nmodels and can serve as a construction basis for an efficient and robust\\nsimulation tool for the systematic development of an entirely model-independent\\nhedging strategy.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.CP\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.CP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T05:48:52Z\"}"}
