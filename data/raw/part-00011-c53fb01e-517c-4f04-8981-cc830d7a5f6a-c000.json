The observed\\ndata consist of pairs of multivariate distributions for ligands from one cell\\ntype and corresponding receptors from another. For each ordered pair $e=(l,r)$\\nof cell types $(l \\\\neq r)$ and each sample $i = 1, \\\\ldots, n$, we observe a\\npair of distributions $(F_{ei}, G_{ei})$ of gene expressions for ligands and\\nreceptors of cell types $l$ and $r$, respectively. The aim is to set up a\\nregression of receptor distributions $G_{ei}$ given ligand distributions\\n$F_{ei}$. A key challenge is that these distributions reside in distinct spaces\\nof differing dimensions. We formulate the regression of multivariate densities\\non multivariate densities using a generalized Bayes framework with the sliced\\nWasserstein distance between fitted and observed distributions. Finally, we use\\ninference under such regressions to define a directed graph for cell-cell\\ncommunications.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,stat.AP,stat.CO,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T03:46:03Z\"}"}
