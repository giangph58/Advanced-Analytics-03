However, optimizing donor-acceptor\\n(D-A) combinations to achieve high power conversion efficiency (PCE) remains a\\nsignificant challenge. In this work, we propose a framework that integrates\\nlarge-scale pretraining of graph neural networks (GNNs) with a GPT-2\\n(Generative Pretrained Transformer 2)-based reinforcement learning (RL)\\nstrategy to design OPV molecules with potentially high PCE. This approach\\nproduces candidate molecules with predicted efficiencies approaching 21\\\\%,\\nalthough further experimental validation is required. Moreover, we conducted a\\npreliminary fragment-level analysis to identify structural motifs recognized by\\nthe RL model that may contribute to enhanced PCE, thus providing design\\nguidelines for the broader research community. To facilitate continued\\ndiscovery, we are building the largest open-source OPV dataset to date,\\nexpected to include nearly 3,000 donor-acceptor pairs. Finally, we discuss\\nplans to collaborate with experimental teams on synthesizing and characterizing\\nAI-designed molecules, which will provide new data to refine and improve our\\npredictive and generative models.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T06:31:15Z\"}"}
