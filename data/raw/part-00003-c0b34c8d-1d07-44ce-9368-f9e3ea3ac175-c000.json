Our approach leverages a multi-agent decision-making\\nmodel known as the Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics (NOD) to address the narrow\\ncorridor passage problem, formulated as a multi-robot navigation game. By\\nintegrating the NOD model with a multi-robot path planning algorithm, we\\ndemonstrate that the framework effectively reduces the likelihood of deadlocks\\nduring corridor traversal. To ensure scalability with an increasing number of\\nrobots, we introduce a game reduction technique that enables efficient\\ncoordination in larger groups. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to\\nvalidate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.MA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:14:55Z\"}"}
