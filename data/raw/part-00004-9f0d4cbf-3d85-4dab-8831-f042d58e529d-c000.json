After positing\\nthat export intensity acts as a continuous treatment, we investigate\\ncounterfactual productivity levels in a quasi-experimental setting. For our\\npurpose, we exploit a control group of non-temporary exporters that have\\nalready sustained the fixed costs of reaching foreign markets, thus controlling\\nfor self-selection into exporting. Our findings reveal a non-linear\\nrelationship between export intensity and productivity, with small albeit\\nstatistically significant benefits ranging from 0.1% to 0.6% per year only\\nafter exports reach 60% of total revenues. After we look at sales, variable\\ncosts, capital intensity, and the propensity to filing patents, we show that,\\nbefore the 60% threshold, economies of scale and capital adjustment offset each\\nother and induce, on average, a minimal albeit statistically significant loss\\nin productivity of about 0.01% per year. Crucially, we find that heterogeneous\\nexport intensity is associated with the firm's position on the technological\\nfrontier, as the propensity to file a patent increases when export intensity\\nranges in 8%-60% with a peak at 40%. The latest finding further highlights that\\nlearning-by-exporting is linked to the building of absorptive capacity.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:56:09Z\"}"}
