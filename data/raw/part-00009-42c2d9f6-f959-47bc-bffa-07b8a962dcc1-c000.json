Verch [Comm. Math.\\nPhys. 378 (2020) 851-889]. Topics include: a brief introduction to algebraic\\nQFT, measurement schemes in QFT, state updates, multiple measurements and the\\nresolution of Sorkin's \\\"impossible measurement\\\" problem. Examples using\\nsuitable theories based on Green hyperbolic operators are given, and the\\ninterpretational significance of the framework is briefly considered. The basic\\nstyle is to give details relating to QFT while taking for granted various facts\\nfrom the theory of globally hyperbolic spacetimes.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,math-ph,math.MP,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T10:56:56Z\"}"}
