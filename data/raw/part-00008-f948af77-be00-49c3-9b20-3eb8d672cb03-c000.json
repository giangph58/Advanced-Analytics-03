The discovery of exceptional\\npoints within mechanical and optical systems has uncovered peculiar effects in\\ntheir vicinity. Here we consider perhaps the simplest quantum model which\\nexhibits an exceptional point and which allows for an analytical treatment. In\\nparticular, we re-examine a two-level atom driven by a laser and suffering from\\nlosses. The same exceptional point arises in several non-Hermitian matrices\\nwhich determine various aspects of the dynamics of the system. There are\\nconsequences for some important observables, for example the spectrum evolves\\nfrom being a Lorentzian-like singlet to a Mollow triplet upon passing through\\nthe exceptional point. Our analysis supports the perspective that viewing\\ncertain quantum systems through the lens of exceptional points offers some\\ndesirable explanatory advantages.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T17:07:17Z\"}"}
