{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21572v1\", \"title\": \"Powerful randomization tests for subgroup analysis\", \"summary\": \"Randomization tests are widely used to generate valid $p$-values for testing\\nsharp null hypotheses in finite-population causal inference. This article\\nextends their application to subgroup analysis. We show that directly testing\\nsubgroup null hypotheses may lack power due to small subgroup sizes.\\nIncorporating an estimator of the conditional average treatment effect (CATE)\\ncan substantially improve power but requires splitting the treatment variables\\nbetween estimation and testing to preserve finite-sample validity. To this end,\\nwe propose BaR-learner, a Bayesian extension of the popular method R-learner\\nfor CATE estimation. BaR-learner imputes the treatment variables reserved for\\nrandomization tests, reducing information loss due to sample-splitting.\\nFurthermore, we show that the treatment variables most informative for training\\nBaR-learner are different from those most valuable for increasing test power.\\nMotivated by this insight, we introduce AdaSplit, a sample-splitting procedure\\nthat adaptively allocates units between estimation and testing. Simulation\\nstudies demonstrate that our method yields more powerful randomization tests\\nthan baselines that omit CATE estimation or rely on random sample-splitting. We\\nalso apply our method to a blood pressure intervention trial, identifying\\npatient subgroups with significant treatment effects.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T12:21:50Z\"}"}
