Advancing towards fault-tolerant quantum\\ncomputing will require an understanding of the underlying error mechanisms in\\nlogical primitives as they relate to the performance of quantum error\\ncorrection. In this work we demonstrate the novel capability to characterize\\nthe physical error properties relevant to fault-tolerant operations via cycle\\nerror reconstruction. We illustrate this diagnostic capability for a\\ntransversal CNOT, a prototypical component of quantum logical operations, in a\\n16-qubit register of a trapped-ion quantum computer. Our error characterization\\ntechnique offers three key capabilities: (i) identifying context-dependent\\nphysical layer errors, enabling their mitigation; (ii) contextualizing\\ncomponent gates in the environment of logical operators, validating the\\nperformance differences in terms of characterized component-level physics, and\\n(iii) providing a scalable method for predicting quantum error correction\\nperformance using pertinent error terms, differentiating correctable versus\\nuncorrectable physical layer errors. The methods with which our results are\\nobtained have scalable resource requirements that can be extended with moderate\\noverhead to capture overall logical performance in increasingly large and\\ncomplex systems.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T11:22:32Z\"}"}
