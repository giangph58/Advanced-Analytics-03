{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16431v1\", \"title\": \"Target Concrete Score Matching: A Holistic Framework for Discrete\\n  Diffusion\", \"summary\": \"Discrete diffusion is a promising framework for modeling and generating\\ndiscrete data. In this work, we present Target Concrete Score Matching (TCSM),\\na novel and versatile objective for training and fine-tuning discrete diffusion\\nmodels. TCSM provides a general framework with broad applicability. It supports\\npre-training discrete diffusion models directly from data samples, and many\\nexisting discrete diffusion approaches naturally emerge as special cases of our\\nmore general TCSM framework. Furthermore, the same TCSM objective extends to\\npost-training of discrete diffusion models, including fine-tuning using reward\\nfunctions or preference data, and distillation of knowledge from pre-trained\\nautoregressive models. These new capabilities stem from the core idea of TCSM,\\nestimating the concrete score of the target distribution, which resides in the\\noriginal (clean) data space. This allows seamless integration with reward\\nfunctions and pre-trained models, which inherently only operate in the clean\\ndata space rather than the noisy intermediate spaces of diffusion processes.\\nOur experiments on language modeling tasks demonstrate that TCSM matches or\\nsurpasses current methods. Additionally, TCSM is versatile, applicable to both\\npre-training and post-training scenarios, offering greater flexibility and\\nsample efficiency.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T05:32:58Z\"}"}
