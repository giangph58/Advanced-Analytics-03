NGC 4395 and POX 52 are two\\nprototypical IMBH hosts, both exhibiting multi-line evidence of low-mass black\\nhole activity. Here, we report the first detection of mid-infrared (MIR) lags\\nin response to optical variability, with measurements of $3.0^{+2.4}_{-1.9}$\\ndays for NGC 4395 and $35.2^{+14.2}_{-11.7}$ days for POX~52 at $3.4$ $\\\\mu$m,\\nrespectively, using archival optical data and observations from the Wide-field\\nInfrared Survey Explorer (WISE). This detection provides the first\\nreverberation evidence of low-mass black hole activity in POX 52. The time lags\\nof these two low-mass, low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) generally\\nfollow the extent of the $R_{\\\\rm dust}-L_{\\\\rm 5100}$ relation found in\\nhigher-mass AGNs. Based on an empirical relation between the broad-line region\\nand dusty torus size, we constrain the black hole mass of POX 52 to log($M_{\\\\rm\\nBH}$/$M_\\\\odot$) = 5.5 $\\\\pm$ 0.37 (systemic and statistical errors), confirming\\nits IMBH nature. Furthermore, long-term optical continuum monitoring of POX 52\\nreveals a mild inter-band lag of $\\\\lesssim$ 1 day. However, no significant\\nintranight variability was detected during its one-night, high-cadence\\nmonitoring, which we attribute to the longer duty cycle of fast variability in\\nPOX 52 compared to that in NGC 4395.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:54:56Z\"}"}
