Traditional statistical\\nand model-based techniques have been successfully used for path optimization in\\ncommunication networks. However, when dynamic channel propagation\\ncharacteristics such as line-of-sight (LOS), interference, handover, and\\nsignal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR) are included in path\\noptimization, statistical and model-based path planning solutions become\\nobsolete since they cannot adapt to the dynamic and time-varying wireless\\nchannels, especially in the mmWave bands. In this paper, we propose a novel\\nmodel-free actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (AC-DRL) framework for path\\noptimization in UAV-assisted 5G mmWave wireless networks, which combines four\\nimportant aspects of UAV communication: \\\\textit{flight time, handover,\\nconnectivity and SINR}. We train an AC-RL agent that enables a UAV connected to\\na gNB to determine the optimal path to a desired destination in the shortest\\npossible time with minimal gNB handover, while maintaining connectivity and the\\nhighest possible SINR. We train our model with data from a powerful ray tracing\\ntool called Wireless InSite, which uses 3D images of the propagation\\nenvironment and provides data that closely resembles the real propagation\\nenvironment. The simulation results show that our system has superior\\nperformance in tracking high SINR compared to other selected RL algorithms.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI,cs.LG,eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:28:04Z\"}"}
