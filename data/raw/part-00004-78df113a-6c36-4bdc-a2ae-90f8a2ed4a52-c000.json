To assist surgeons achieve this level of accuracy,\\nthe Improved Integrated Robotic Intraocular Snake (I2RIS) with dexterous\\ncapability has been developed. However, such flexible tendon-driven robots\\noften suffer from hysteresis problems, which significantly challenges precise\\ncontrol and positioning. In particular, we observed multi-stage hysteresis\\nphenomena in the small-scale I2RIS. In this paper, we propose an Extended\\nGeneralized Prandtl-Ishlinskii (EGPI) model to increase the fitting accuracy of\\nthe hysteresis. The model incorporates a novel switching mechanism that enables\\nit to describe multi-stage hysteresis in the regions of monotonic input.\\nExperimental validation on I2RIS data demonstrate that the EGPI model\\noutperforms the conventional Generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii (GPI) model in\\nterms of RMSE, NRMSE, and MAE across multiple motor input directions. The EGPI\\nmodel in our study highlights the potential in modeling multi-stage hysteresis\\nin minimally invasive flexible robots.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T14:23:12Z\"}"}
