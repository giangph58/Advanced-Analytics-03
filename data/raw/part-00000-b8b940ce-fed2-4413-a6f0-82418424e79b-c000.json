{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01532v1\", \"title\": \"Incorporating Coupling Knowledge into Echo State Networks for Learning\\n  Spatiotemporally Chaotic Dynamics\", \"summary\": \"Machine learning methods have shown promise in learning chaotic dynamical\\nsystems, enabling model-free short-term prediction and attractor\\nreconstruction. However, when applied to large-scale, spatiotemporally chaotic\\nsystems, purely data-driven machine learning methods often suffer from\\ninefficiencies, as they require a large learning model size and a massive\\namount of training data to achieve acceptable performance. To address this\\nchallenge, we incorporate the spatial coupling structure of the target system\\nas an inductive bias in the network design. Specifically, we introduce\\nphysics-guided clustered echo state networks, leveraging the efficiency of the\\necho state networks as a base model. Experimental results on benchmark chaotic\\nsystems demonstrate that our physics-informed method outperforms existing echo\\nstate network models in learning the target chaotic systems. Additionally, our\\nmodels exhibit robustness to noise in training data and remain effective even\\nwhen prior coupling knowledge is imperfect. This approach has the potential to\\nenhance other machine learning methods.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.CD\", \"categories\": \"nlin.CD,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T09:19:33Z\"}"}
