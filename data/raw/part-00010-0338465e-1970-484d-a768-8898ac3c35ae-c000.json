Furthermore, the\\nassociated propagation delays have been lengthy, and these do not correlate\\nwell with the number of ecosystems involved in the associated sequences. Nor\\ndoes the presence or absence of particularly ecosystems in the sequences yield\\nclear, interpretable patterns. With these results, the paper contributes to the\\noverlapping knowledge bases about software ecosystems, traceability, and\\nvulnerabilities.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE,cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T10:38:11Z\"}"}
