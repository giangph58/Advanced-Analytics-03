Random\\nSubstitutional Crystals (RSCs), where atomic species are randomly distributed\\nthroughout a crystal lattice, present a promising route to overcome this\\ncompetitive relation. Although extensive studies have focused on local ionic\\nhopping, the role of mesoscale structural organization in determining\\nmacroscopic conductivity remains poorly understood, limiting the rational\\ndesign of optimal compositions. Here, we systematically investigate the ionic\\nconductivity of NaCl-type RSCs as a function of composition using molecular\\ndynamics simulations. We find that ionic conductivity increases sharply once\\nthe carrier ion concentration exceeds a critical threshold, without disrupting\\nthe underlying crystal structure. Strikingly, this threshold aligns with the\\nsite percolation threshold predicted by percolation theory. Our findings\\nestablish ion percolation as a universal design principle that reconciles the\\ntrade-off between conductivity and stability, offering a simple and broadly\\napplicable strategy for the development of robust, high-performance solid\\nelectrolytes.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T07:22:14Z\"}"}
