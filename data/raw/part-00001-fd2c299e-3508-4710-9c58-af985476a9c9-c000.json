{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15987v1\", \"title\": \"Few-shot Hate Speech Detection Based on the MindSpore Framework\", \"summary\": \"The proliferation of hate speech on social media poses a significant threat\\nto online communities, requiring effective detection systems. While deep\\nlearning models have shown promise, their performance often deteriorates in\\nfew-shot or low-resource settings due to reliance on large annotated corpora.\\nTo address this, we propose MS-FSLHate, a prompt-enhanced neural framework for\\nfew-shot hate speech detection implemented on the MindSpore deep learning\\nplatform. The model integrates learnable prompt embeddings, a CNN-BiLSTM\\nbackbone with attention pooling, and synonym-based adversarial data\\naugmentation to improve generalization. Experimental results on two benchmark\\ndatasets-HateXplain and HSOL-demonstrate that our approach outperforms\\ncompetitive baselines in precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, the\\nframework shows high efficiency and scalability, suggesting its suitability for\\ndeployment in resource-constrained environments. These findings highlight the\\npotential of combining prompt-based learning with adversarial augmentation for\\nrobust and adaptable hate speech detection in few-shot scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T15:42:33Z\"}"}
