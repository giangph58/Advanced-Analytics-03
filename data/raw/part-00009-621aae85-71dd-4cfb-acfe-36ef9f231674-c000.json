Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising approach to\\nenhancing reconstruction accuracy while reducing acquisition and processing\\ntime, thereby minimizing patient radiation exposure and discomfort and\\nultimately benefiting clinical diagnosis. This review explores state-of-the-art\\nAI-based 3D reconstruction algorithms in radiological imaging, categorizing\\nthem into explicit and implicit approaches based on their underlying\\nprinciples. Explicit methods include point-based, volume-based, and Gaussian\\nrepresentations, while implicit methods encompass implicit prior embedding and\\nneural radiance fields. Additionally, we examine commonly used evaluation\\nmetrics and benchmark datasets. Finally, we discuss the current state of\\ndevelopment, key challenges, and future research directions in this evolving\\nfield.
