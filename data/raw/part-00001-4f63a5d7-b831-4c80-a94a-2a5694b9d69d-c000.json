Observations of the Milky Way and local galaxies have\\nrevealed an ubiquitous disk structure with two distinctive components: an old\\nthick disk and a relatively young thin disk. The formation of this dual-disk\\nstructure and the mechanisms that develop the thickness of the disk are still\\nunclear. Whether the disk thickness inherit from the birth environment or is\\nestablished through secular dynamical heating after formation is under debate.\\nIn this work we identify a relatively young ($\\\\sim$6.6 billion years old)\\ngeometric thick disk in the Milky Way, with a scale height of $0.64$ kpc at the\\nSolar Circle. This young thick component exhibits comparable thickness and\\nflaring strength to the canonical old thick disk but is more radially extended\\nand systematically younger. We also identify thin disk components that formed\\nbefore and after this young thick disk. Detailed analysis of the solar vicinity\\nstructure suggests that the young thick disk marks the onset of a new phase of\\nupside-down disk formation. These findings strongly discount the role of\\nsecular dynamical heating and support a turbulent, bursty birth environment as\\nthe primary mechanism behind thick disk formation. The existence of two thick\\ndisk components suggests that the Milky Way has undergone at least two episodes\\nof turbulent and bursty star formation, likely triggered by galaxy mergers.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T05:01:21Z\"}"}
