Lasserre's hierarchy (also known as the moment- or sum-of-squares\\nhierarchy) provides a sequence of lower bounds $\\\\{f_{(r)}\\\\}_{r \\\\in \\\\mathbb N}$\\non the minimum value $f^*$, where $r$ refers to the allowed degrees in the\\nsum-of-squares hierarchy. A natural question is how fast the hierarchy\\nconverges as a function of the parameter $r$. The current state-of-the-art is\\ndue to Baldi and Slot [SIAM J. on Applied Algebraic Geometry, 2024] and roughly\\nshows a convergence rate of order $1/r$. Here we obtain closely related results\\nvia a different approach: the polynomial kernel method. We also discuss\\nlimitations of the polynomial kernel method, suggesting a lower bound of order\\n$1/r^2$ for our approach.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T14:19:54Z\"}"}
