{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02630v1\", \"title\": \"Grammar-based Ordinary Differential Equation Discovery\", \"summary\": \"The understanding and modeling of complex physical phenomena through\\ndynamical systems has historically driven scientific progress, as it provides\\nthe tools for predicting the behavior of different systems under diverse\\nconditions through time. The discovery of dynamical systems has been\\nindispensable in engineering, as it allows for the analysis and prediction of\\ncomplex behaviors for computational modeling, diagnostics, prognostics, and\\ncontrol of engineered systems. Joining recent efforts that harness the power of\\nsymbolic regression in this domain, we propose a novel framework for the\\nend-to-end discovery of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), termed\\nGrammar-based ODE Discovery Engine (GODE). The proposed methodology combines\\nformal grammars with dimensionality reduction and stochastic search for\\nefficiently navigating high-dimensional combinatorial spaces. Grammars allow us\\nto seed domain knowledge and structure for both constraining, as well as,\\nexploring the space of candidate expressions. GODE proves to be more sample-\\nand parameter-efficient than state-of-the-art transformer-based models and to\\ndiscover more accurate and parsimonious ODE expressions than both genetic\\nprogramming- and other grammar-based methods for more complex inference tasks,\\nsuch as the discovery of structural dynamics. Thus, we introduce a tool that\\ncould play a catalytic role in dynamics discovery tasks, including modeling,\\nsystem identification, and monitoring tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.CE,cs.SC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:28:13Z\"}"}
