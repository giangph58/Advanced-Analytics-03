It highlights the potential of quantum machine learning in\\nbioinformatics, addressing computational efficiency limitations of traditional\\nmethods as data complexity grows. QSVM uses quantum kernel functions for data\\nmapping, while VQC employs parameterized quantum circuits for classification.\\nResults show QSVM and VQC achieving 70% and 73% accuracy, respectively, with\\nQSVM excelling in balancing classes. Despite challenges like computational\\ndemands and hardware limitations, quantum methods show promise, suggesting\\nfuture improvements with ongoing advancements.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T08:09:34Z\"}"}
