{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20989v1\", \"title\": \"Photonic Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks with Adaptive State\\n  Injection\", \"summary\": \"Linear optical architectures have been extensively investigated for quantum\\ncomputing and quantum machine learning applications. Recently, proposals for\\nphotonic quantum machine learning have combined linear optics with resource\\nadaptivity, such as adaptive circuit reconfiguration, which promises to enhance\\nexpressivity and improve algorithm performances and scalability. Moreover,\\nlinear optical platforms preserve some subspaces due to the fixed number of\\nparticles during the computation, a property recently exploited to design a\\nnovel quantum convolutional neural networks. This last architecture has shown\\nan advantage in terms of running time complexity and of the number of\\nparameters needed with respect to other quantum neural network proposals. In\\nthis work, we design and experimentally implement the first photonic quantum\\nconvolutional neural network (PQCNN) architecture based on particle-number\\npreserving circuits equipped with state injection, an approach recently\\nproposed to increase the controllability of linear optical circuits.\\nSubsequently, we experimentally validate the PQCNN for a binary image\\nclassification on a photonic platform utilizing a semiconductor quantum\\ndot-based single-photon source and programmable integrated photonic\\ninterferometers comprising 8 and 12 modes. In order to investigate the\\nscalability of the PQCNN design, we have performed numerical simulations on\\ndatasets of different sizes. We highlight the potential utility of a simple\\nadaptive technique for a nonlinear Boson Sampling task, compatible with\\nnear-term quantum devices.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:57:01Z\"}"}
