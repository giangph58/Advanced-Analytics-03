Our\\nresult builds on the Gily\\\\'en--Hastings--Vazirani (sub)exponential oracle\\nseparation for adiabatic quantum computing. With a sequence of perturbative\\nreductions, we compile their construction into two standalone objective\\nfunctions, whose oracles can be directly leveraged by the plain adiabatic\\nevolution and Schr\\\\\\\"odinger operator evolution for discrete and continuous\\noptimization, respectively.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.CC,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T03:44:46Z\"}"}
