We focused on analyzing the changes in inductance when\\nnon-ferromagnetic materials (such as H59 brass) were inserted into the coil and\\nverified the impact of the copper rod on inductance through theoretical\\nderivation and experimental validation. Based on Maxwell's equations, the\\nmagnetic field distribution within the copper rod was thoroughly derived, and\\nthe inductance and resistance values were experimentally measured. These\\nresults confirm the accuracy of the theoretical model.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.class-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.class-ph,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T07:14:58Z\"}"}
