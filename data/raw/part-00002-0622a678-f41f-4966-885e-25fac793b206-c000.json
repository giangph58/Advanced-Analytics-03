However, these experiments have a start\\nand an end, which introduces unavoidable transitions out of and into static\\nregimes that alter the intended expansion profile. We show that the resulting\\nparticle spectra can be overwhelmingly dominated by these transition periods,\\nwhich calls for a careful interpretation of experimental outcomes. In\\nprospective Schwinger effect experiments, by contrast, transition effects do\\nnot dominate particle production, and such a reinterpretation may not be\\nnecessary.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,cond-mat.quant-gas,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:43:00Z\"}"}
