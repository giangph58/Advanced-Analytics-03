{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14978v1\", \"title\": \"clusttraj: a solvent-informed clustering tool for molecular modeling\", \"summary\": \"Clustering techniques are consolidated as a powerful strategy for analyzing\\nthe extensive data generated from molecular modeling. In particular, some tools\\nhave been developed to cluster configurations from classical simulations with a\\nstandard focus on individual units, ranging from small molecules to complex\\nproteins. Since the standard approach includes computing the Root Mean Square\\nDeviation (RMSD) of atomic positions, accounting for the permutation between\\natoms is crucial for optimizing the clustering procedure in the presence of\\nidentical molecules. To address this issue, we present the clusttraj program, a\\nsolvent-informed clustering package that fixes inflated RMSD values by finding\\nthe optimal pairing between configurations. The program combines reordering\\nschemes with the Kabsch algorithm to minimize the RMSD of molecular\\nconfigurations before running a hierarchical clustering protocol. By\\nconsidering evaluation metrics, one can determine the ideal threshold in an\\nautomated fashion and compare the different linkage schemes available. The\\nprogram capabilities are exemplified by considering solute-solvent systems\\nranging from pure water clusters to a solvated protein or a small solute in\\ndifferent solvents. As a result, we investigate the dependence on different\\nparameters, such as the system size and reordering method, and also the\\nrepresentativeness of the cluster medoids for the characterization of optical\\nproperties. clusttraj is implemented as a Python library and can be employed to\\ncluster generic ensembles of molecular configurations that go beyond\\nsolute-solvent systems.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T09:12:00Z\"}"}
