{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05883v1\", \"title\": \"Rolling Horizon Coverage Control with Collaborative Autonomous Agents\", \"summary\": \"This work proposes a coverage controller that enables an aerial team of\\ndistributed autonomous agents to collaboratively generate non-myopic coverage\\nplans over a rolling finite horizon, aiming to cover specific points on the\\nsurface area of a 3D object of interest. The collaborative coverage problem,\\nformulated, as a distributed model predictive control problem, optimizes the\\nagents' motion and camera control inputs, while considering inter-agent\\nconstraints aiming at reducing work redundancy. The proposed coverage\\ncontroller integrates constraints based on light-path propagation techniques to\\npredict the parts of the object's surface that are visible with regard to the\\nagents' future anticipated states. This work also demonstrates how complex,\\nnon-linear visibility assessment constraints can be converted into logical\\nexpressions that are embedded as binary constraints into a mixed-integer\\noptimization framework. The proposed approach has been demonstrated through\\nsimulations and practical applications for inspecting buildings with unmanned\\naerial vehicles (UAVs).\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T10:17:38Z\"}"}
