For the safe use, management and maintenance of\\nlithium-ion batteries, the state of health (SOH) of lithium-ion batteries is an\\nimportant indicator so that the SOH estimation is of significant practical\\nvalue. In order to accurately predict SOH, this paper proposes a fusion\\nprediction model which combines particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm,\\nbi-directional long-short time memory network (BiLSTM) and adaptive boosting\\n(AdaBoost) algorithm. In the proposed prediction model, indirect health\\nindicators (HIs), which characterize battery degradation, are obtained with the\\nhelp of incremental capacity analysis (ICA), and is fed into BiLSTM to extract\\ntime-series features, whose parameters are optimized by employing PSO\\nalgorithm. On this basis, the AdaBoost algorithm is applied to reduce the risk\\nof overfitting the PSO-BiLSTM model. The study based on lithium-ion battery\\ndata from Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE) shows that the\\nPSO-BiLSTM-AdaBoost model has higher accuracy, better robustness, and\\ngeneralization ability.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T09:05:56Z\"}"}
