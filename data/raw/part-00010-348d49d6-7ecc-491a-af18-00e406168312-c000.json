Specifically, we examine the case where the true\\ndata-generating process features a hidden Markov regime sequence with\\ncovariate-dependent transition probabilities, but estimation proceeds under a\\nsimplified mixture model that assumes regimes are independent and identically\\ndistributed. We show that the parameters governing the conditional distribution\\nof the observables can still be consistently estimated under this\\nmisspecification, provided certain regularity conditions hold. Our results\\nhighlight a practical benefit of using computationally simpler mixture models\\nin settings where regime dependence is complex or difficult to model directly.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.EM\", \"categories\": \"econ.EM,math.ST,stat.ME,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:10:30Z\"}"}
