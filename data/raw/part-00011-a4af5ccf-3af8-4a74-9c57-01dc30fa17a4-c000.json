We show that for any positive integers $m \\\\leq n$, there exists a\\nvirtual link $K$ with $b_1(K) = m$ and $b_2(K) = n$, thereby answering a\\nquestion posed by Nakanishi and Satoh. In some sense, this gap between the two\\nformulations measures how far the knot is from being classical. We also use\\nthese bridge number analyses to systematically construct families of links in\\nwhich quiver invariants can distinguish between links that share the same\\nbiquandle counting invariant.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GT\", \"categories\": \"math.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:44:30Z\"}"}
