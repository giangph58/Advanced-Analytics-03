In this model framework, we establish a fine version of the\\nso-called creation-of-chaos phenomenon: in weak norms, the mean-field\\napproximation for a typical particle is shown to hold with an accuracy\\n$O(N^{-1})$ up to an error due solely to initial pair correlations, which is\\ndamped exponentially over time. The novelty is that the initial information\\nappears in our estimates only through pair correlations, which currently seems\\ninaccessible to other methods. This is complemented by corresponding results on\\nhigher-order creation of chaos in the form of higher-order correlation\\nestimates.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,math-ph,math.AP,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T06:26:01Z\"}"}
