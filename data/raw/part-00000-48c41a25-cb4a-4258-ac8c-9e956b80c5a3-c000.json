In\\nthis progress report, we explore various Ramsey interrogation schemes tailored\\nto optical atomic clocks primarily limited by laser noise. To incorporate\\nfrequency fluctuations directly into the theoretical model, we consider a\\nBayesian framework. In this context, we review fundamental bounds arising in\\nBayesian estimation theory, which serve as a benchmark throughout this work. We\\ninvestigate the trade-off between entanglement-enhanced sensitivity and\\nrobustness against laser noise in order to identify optimal initial states,\\nmeasurement schemes and estimation strategies. Beside standard protocols based\\non coherent spin states, squeezed spin states and GHZ states, we consider\\nvariational Ramsey protocols implemented via low-depth quantum circuits based\\non one-axis twisting operations to approach optimal stability. In particular,\\nwe review known and identify new optimal interrogation schemes for a variety of\\nscenarios, including different experimental platforms, ensemble sizes and\\nregimes characterized by a wide range of interrogation durations and dead\\ntimes. Hence, this work establishes a comprehensive theoretical framework for\\noptimizing Ramsey interrogation schemes, providing guidance for the development\\nof next-generation optical atomic clocks.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T09:46:29Z\"}"}
