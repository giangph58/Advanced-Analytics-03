{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20941v1\", \"title\": \"Conformal-DP: Differential Privacy on Riemannian Manifolds via Conformal\\n  Transformation\", \"summary\": \"Differential Privacy (DP) has been established as a safeguard for private\\ndata sharing by adding perturbations to information release. Prior research on\\nDP has extended beyond data in the flat Euclidean space and addressed data on\\ncurved manifolds, e.g., diffusion tensor MRI, social networks, or organ shape\\nanalysis, by adding perturbations along geodesic distances. However, existing\\nmanifold-aware DP methods rely on the assumption that samples are uniformly\\ndistributed across the manifold. In reality, data densities vary, leading to a\\nbiased noise imbalance across manifold regions, weakening the privacy-utility\\ntrade-offs. To address this gap, we propose a novel mechanism: Conformal-DP,\\nutilizing conformal transformations on the Riemannian manifold to equalize\\nlocal sample density and to redefine geodesic distances accordingly while\\npreserving the intrinsic geometry of the manifold. Our theoretical analysis\\nyields two main results. First, we prove that the conformal factor computed\\nfrom local kernel-density estimates is explicitly data-density-aware; Second,\\nunder the conformal metric, the mechanism satisfies $ \\\\varepsilon\\n$-differential privacy on any complete Riemannian manifold and admits a\\nclosed-form upper bound on the expected geodesic error that depends only on the\\nmaximal density ratio, not on global curvatureof the manifold. Our experimental\\nresults validate that the mechanism achieves high utility while providing the $\\n\\\\varepsilon $-DP guarantee for both homogeneous and especially heterogeneous\\nmanifold data.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,math.DG,stat.OT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:05:55Z\"}"}
