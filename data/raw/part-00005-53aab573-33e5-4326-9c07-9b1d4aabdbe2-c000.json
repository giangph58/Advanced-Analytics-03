That is, $|A \\\\bigtriangleup B| \\\\in D$\\nholds for every pair of distinct sets $A, B \\\\in \\\\mathcal{F}$. Kleitman's\\ncelebrated discrete isodiametric inequality states that $f_D(n)$ is maximized\\nat Hamming balls of radius $d/2$ when $D = \\\\{1, \\\\dots, d\\\\}$. We study the\\ngeneralization where $D$ is a set of arithmetic progression and determine\\n$f_D(n)$ asymptotically for all homogeneous $D$. In the special case when $D$\\nis an interval, our result confirms a conjecture of Huang, Klurman, and\\nPohoata. Moreover, we demonstrate a dichotomy in the growth of $f_D(n)$,\\nshowing linear growth in $n$ when $D$ is a non-homogeneous arithmetic\\nprogression. Different from previous combinatorial and spectral approaches, we\\ndeduce our results by converting the restricted distance problems to restricted\\nintersection problems.\\n  Our proof ideas can be adapted to prove upper bounds on $t$-distance sets in\\nHamming cubes (also known as binary $t$-codes), which has been extensively\\nstudied by algebraic combinatorialists community, improving previous bounds\\nfrom polynomial methods and optimization approaches.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,cs.DM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T17:56:56Z\"}"}
