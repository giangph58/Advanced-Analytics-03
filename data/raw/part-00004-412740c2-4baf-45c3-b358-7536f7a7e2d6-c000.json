{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11301v1\", \"title\": \"Learning to Be A Doctor: Searching for Effective Medical Agent\\n  Architectures\", \"summary\": \"Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated strong capabilities\\nacross a wide range of tasks, and their application in the medical domain holds\\nparticular promise due to the demand for high generalizability and reliance on\\ninterdisciplinary knowledge. However, existing medical agent systems often rely\\non static, manually crafted workflows that lack the flexibility to accommodate\\ndiverse diagnostic requirements and adapt to emerging clinical scenarios.\\nMotivated by the success of automated machine learning (AutoML), this paper\\nintroduces a novel framework for the automated design of medical agent\\narchitectures. Specifically, we define a hierarchical and expressive agent\\nsearch space that enables dynamic workflow adaptation through structured\\nmodifications at the node, structural, and framework levels. Our framework\\nconceptualizes medical agents as graph-based architectures composed of diverse,\\nfunctional node types and supports iterative self-improvement guided by\\ndiagnostic feedback. Experimental results on skin disease diagnosis tasks\\ndemonstrate that the proposed method effectively evolves workflow structures\\nand significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy over time. This work represents\\nthe first fully automated framework for medical agent architecture design and\\noffers a scalable, adaptable foundation for deploying intelligent agents in\\nreal-world clinical environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:44:21Z\"}"}
