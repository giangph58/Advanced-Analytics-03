In this work, we perform the first global fit\\nof elastic neutrino-nucleus and neutrino-electron scattering data to further\\ntest the SM within a consistent framework. Our results on the neutrino charge\\nradius, the only non-zero electromagnetic property of neutrinos in the SM, show\\nno significant deviation, indicating no large beyond the SM flavor-dependent\\neffects for electron and muon neutrinos. By incorporating solar neutrino data\\nfrom dark matter direct detection experiments, we also place the most stringent\\nconstraints on the tau neutrino charge radius obtained from neutrino scattering\\nexperiments. Additionally, we determine updated constraints on the vector and\\naxial-vector neutrino-electron neutral current couplings, adjusting for\\nflavor-dependent effects and for the different experimental momentum transfers.\\nThe global analysis reveals two allowed solutions: one close to the SM\\nprediction, and a degenerate solution that is favored. We show that future dark\\nmatter detectors could achieve sufficient precision to resolve the degeneracy.\\nAs we move toward the precision era, this work demonstrates the crucial need to\\nproperly account for flavor- and momentum-dependent effects to avoid\\nmisinterpretations of the data.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T17:08:28Z\"}"}
