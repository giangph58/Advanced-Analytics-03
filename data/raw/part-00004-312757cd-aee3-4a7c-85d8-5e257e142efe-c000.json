This study\\nanalyzes MDI-QKD performance in thermal-loss and phase noise channels, modeled\\nas depolarizing and dephasing channels to capture thermal and phase noise\\neffects. Based on this channel framework, we derive analytical expressions for\\nBell state measurement probabilities, quantum bit error rates (QBER), and\\nsecret key rates (SKR) of MDI-QKD. Our simulations reveal that SKR decreases\\nexponentially with transmission distance, with performance further degraded by\\nincreasing thermal noise and phase noise, particularly under high thermal noise\\nconditions. These findings offer insights into enhancing MDI-QKD's noise\\nresilience, supporting secure key generation in practical, noisy environments.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T09:39:34Z\"}"}
