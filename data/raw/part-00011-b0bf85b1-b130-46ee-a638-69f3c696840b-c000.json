{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19935v1\", \"title\": \"Enhancing Quality for VVC Compressed Videos with Omniscient Quality\\n  Enhancement Model\", \"summary\": \"The latest video coding standard H.266/VVC has shown its great improvement in\\nterms of compression performance when compared to its predecessor HEVC\\nstandard. Though VVC was implemented with many advanced techniques, it still\\nmet the same challenges as its predecessor due to the need for even higher\\nperceptual quality demand at the decoder side as well as the compression\\nperformance at the encoder side. The advancement of Artificial Intelligence\\n(AI) technology, notably the deep learning-based video quality enhancement\\nmethods, was shown to be a promising approach to improving the perceptual\\nquality experience. In this paper, we propose a novel Omniscient video quality\\nenhancement Network for VVC compressed Videos. The Omniscient Network for\\ncompressed video quality enhancement was originally designed for HEVC\\ncompressed videos in which not only the spatial-temporal features but also\\ncross-frequencies information were employed to augment the visual quality.\\nInspired by this work, we propose a modification of the OVQE model and\\nintegrate it into the lasted STD-VVC (Standard Versatile Video Coding) decoder\\narchitecture. As assessed in a rich set of test conditions, the proposed\\nOVQE-VVC solution is able to achieve significant PSNR improvement, notably\\naround 0.74 dB and up to 1.2 dB with respect to the original STD-VVC codec.\\nThis also corresponds to around 19.6% of bitrate saving while keeping a similar\\nquality observation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:08:49Z\"}"}
