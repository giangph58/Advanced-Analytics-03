{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21696v1\", \"title\": \"MovementVR: An open-source tool for the study of motor control and\\n  learning in virtual reality\", \"summary\": \"Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly used to enhance the ecological validity\\nof motor control and learning studies by providing immersive, interactive\\nenvironments with precise motion tracking. However, designing realistic\\nVR-based motor tasks remains complex, requiring advanced programming skills and\\nlimiting accessibility in research and clinical settings. MovementVR is an\\nopen-source platform designed to address these challenges by enabling the\\ncreation of customizable, naturalistic reaching tasks in VR without coding\\nexpertise. It integrates physics-based hand-object interactions, real-time hand\\ntracking, and flexible experimental paradigms, including motor adaptation and\\nreinforcement learning. The intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) allows\\nresearchers to customize task parameters and paradigm structure. Unlike\\nexisting platforms, MovementVR eliminates the need for scripting while\\nsupporting extensive customization and preserving ecological validity and\\nrealism. In addition to reducing technical barriers, MovementVR lowers\\nfinancial constraints by being compatible with consumer-grade VR headsets. It\\nis freely available with comprehensive documentation, facilitating broader\\nadoption in movement research and rehabilitation.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.QM\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.QM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:39:01Z\"}"}
