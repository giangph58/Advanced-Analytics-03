It is shown that while\\nbond-dependent terms do not affect the ground state classically, quantum\\nfluctuations select preferred magnetization direction of the ferromagnetic\\nstate. Anisotropic terms of the magnetic Hamiltonian also give rise to\\nmagnon-magnon interactions that lead to spontaneous decays and spectral\\nrenormalization, which we illustrate using non-linear spin-wave theory.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:00:32Z\"}"}
