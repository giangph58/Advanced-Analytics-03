The orbit of $x^{\\\\lambda}$ under the action of\\n$\\\\mathcal{S}_{N}$ (by permutation of coordinates) spans a module $V_{\\\\lambda}%\\n$, the representation induced from the identity representation of $G_{n}$. The\\nspace $V_{\\\\lambda}$ decomposes into a direct sum of irreducible $\\\\mathcal{S}%\\n_{N}$-modules. The spherical function is defined for each of these, it is the\\ncharacter of the module averaged over the group $G_{n}$. This paper concerns\\nthe value of certain spherical functions evaluated at a cycle which has no more\\nthan one entry in each of the three intervals $I_{j}=\\\\left\\\\{\\ni:\\\\lambda_{i}=d_{j}\\\\right\\\\} ,1\\\\leq j\\\\leq3$. These values appear in the study of\\neigenvalues of the Heckman-Polychronakos operators in the paper by V. Gorin and\\nthe author (arXiv:2412:01938v1). The present paper determines the spherical\\nfunction values for $\\\\mathcal{S}_{N}$-modules $V$ of two-row tableau type,\\ncorresponding to Young tableaux of shape $\\\\left[ N-k,k\\\\right] $. The method is\\nbased on analyzing the effect of a cycle on $G_{n}$-invariant elements of $V$.\\nThese are constructed in terms of Hahn polynomials in two variables.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RT\", \"categories\": \"math.RT,math.CA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T16:20:29Z\"}"}
