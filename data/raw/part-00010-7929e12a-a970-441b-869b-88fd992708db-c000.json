We propose a linear distributed algorithm (referred to as\\nRPPAC) that handles asynchronous updates and time-varying heterogeneous\\ninformation delays. Our proposed distributed algorithm utilizes a\\nsurplus-consensus mechanism and information regarding the number of incoming\\nand outgoing links to guarantee state averaging, despite the imbalanced and\\ndelayed information flow in directional networks. The convergence of the RPPAC\\nalgorithm is examined using key properties of the backward product of\\ntime-varying matrices that correspond to different snapshots of the directional\\naugmented network.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T08:05:36Z\"}"}
