As lattice QCD calculations become more precise,\\nthese QED corrections are becoming more important. However, one of the\\nchallenges in adding QED effects to QCD calculations is avoiding power-law\\nsuppressed finite-volume effects. By using the recently introduced\\ninfinite-volume reconstruction method for QED, we are able to avoid this\\nproblem and perform calculations with exponentially-suppressed finite-volume\\neffects.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-lat\", \"categories\": \"hep-lat\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T13:29:40Z\"}"}
