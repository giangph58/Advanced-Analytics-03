Using relativistic atomic structure methods, we\\ncomputed DR rate coefficients under conditions typical of these environments.\\nOur results highlight the critical role of low-lying DR resonances in shaping\\nrate coefficients at kilonova temperatures (~ 10^4 K) and regulating\\ncharge-state distributions. Pronounced near-threshold DR resonances\\nsignificantly influence the evolving ionization states and opacity of neutron\\nstar merger ejecta. Comparisons with previous studies emphasize the necessity\\nof including high-n Rydberg states for accurate DR rate coefficients,\\nespecially for complex heavy ions with dense energy levels. Discrepancies with\\nexisting datasets underscore the need for refined computational techniques to\\nminimize uncertainties. These results provide essential input for interpreting\\nspectroscopic observations of neutron star mergers, including James Webb Space\\nTelescope data. We also put forward suitable candidates for experimental\\nstudies, recognizing the challenges involved in such measurements. The data\\npresented here have potential to refine models of heavy-element\\nnucleosynthesis, enhance plasma simulation accuracy, and improve non-LTE plasma\\nmodeling in astrophysical and laboratory settings.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T07:30:19Z\"}"}
