{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10429v1\", \"title\": \"Out of the box approach to Black hole Information paradox\", \"summary\": \"Suppose a black hole forms from a pure quantum state $\\\\ket{\\\\psi}$. The black\\nhole information loss paradox arises from semiclassical arguments suggesting\\nthat, even in a closed system, the process of black hole formation and\\nevaporation evolves a pure state into a mixed state. Resolution to the paradox\\ntypically demands violation of quantum mechanics or relativity in domains where\\nthey should hold. Instead, I propose that in a complete theory of quantum\\ngravity, any region $\\\\mathcal{U}$ that could collapse into a black hole should\\nalready be described by a mixed state, thus bypassing the paradox entirely. To\\nthat end, I present a model in which the universe is in a quantum\\nerror-corrected state, such that any local black hole appears mixed and encodes\\nno information locally.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:19:57Z\"}"}
