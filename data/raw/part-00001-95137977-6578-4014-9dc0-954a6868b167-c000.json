Moreover, we prove the Li-Yau-Hamilton-Perelman Harnack\\ninequality on super Ricci flows. As a significant application, we prove the\\nequivalence between the volume non-local collapsing property and the lower\\nboundedness of the $W$-entropy on RCD$(0, N)$ spaces. Finally, we use the\\n$W$-entropy to study the logarithmic Sobolev inequality with optimal constant\\non super Ricci flows on metric measure spaces.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG,math.MG,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T05:37:47Z\"}"}
