To address these\\nchallenges, we introduce OmegAMP, a framework that leverages a diffusion-based\\ngenerative model with efficient low-dimensional embeddings, precise\\ncontrollability mechanisms, and novel classifiers with drastically reduced\\nfalse positive rates for candidate filtering. OmegAMP enables the targeted\\ngeneration of AMPs with specific physicochemical properties, activity profiles,\\nand species-specific effectiveness. Moreover, it maximizes sample diversity\\nwhile ensuring faithfulness to the underlying data distribution during\\ngeneration. We demonstrate that OmegAMP achieves state-of-the-art performance\\nacross all stages of the AMP discovery pipeline, significantly advancing the\\npotential of computational frameworks in combating antimicrobial resistance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,q-bio.BM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T04:53:04Z\"}"}
