This\\nsubclass not only shares similar observational properties around the maximum,\\nbut is commonly characterized by a long duration precursor before its maximum.\\nInvestigating the observed properties of the precursor provides constraints on\\nthe mass-loss history of the progenitor.We present observational data of SN\\n2023vbg, a 09ip-like type IIn SN that displayed unique observational properties\\ncompared to other 09ip-like SNe. SN 2023vbg showed a long-duration precursor at\\n$M_g\\\\sim-14$ mag lasting for $\\\\sim100$ days, followed by a bright bump at\\n$M_g\\\\sim-17$ mag at 12-25 days before the maximum. The luminosity of the\\nprecursor is similar to those of other 09ip-like SNe, but the bright bump has\\nnot been observed in other cases.After reaching the peak luminosity, the light\\ncurve exhibited a peculiar smooth decline.While the H$\\\\alpha$ profile displays\\ntwo velocity components ($\\\\sim 500$ and $3000\\\\ \\\\mathrm{km\\\\ s^{-1}}$), a broad\\ncomponent observed in other 09ip-like SNe was not detected. We suggest that\\nthese properties are explained by the difference in the CSM structure as\\ncompared to other 09ip-like SNe; SN 2023vbg had an inner denser CSM component,\\nas well as generally smooth CSM density distribution in a more extended scale,\\nthan in the others. Such diversity of CSM likely reflects the diversity of\\npre-SN outbursts, which in turn may mirror the range of evolutionary pathways\\nin the final stages of the progenitors.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T15:44:05Z\"}"}
