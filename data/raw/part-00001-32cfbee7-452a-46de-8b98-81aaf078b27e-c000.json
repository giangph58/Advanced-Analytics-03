{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10417v1\", \"title\": \"Silent Self-Stabilizing Ranking: Time Optimal and Space Efficient\", \"summary\": \"We present a silent, self-stabilizing ranking protocol for the population\\nprotocol model of distributed computing, where agents interact in randomly\\nchosen pairs to solve a common task. We are given $n$ anonymous agents, and the\\ngoal is to assign each agent a unique rank in $\\\\{1, \\\\dots, n\\\\}$. Given unique\\nranks, it is straightforward to select a designated leader. Thus, our protocol\\nis a self-stabilizing leader election protocol as well. Ranking requires at\\nleast $n$ states per agent; hence, the goal is to minimize the additional\\nnumber of states, called overhead states. The core of our protocol is a\\nspace-efficient but non-self-stabilizing ranking protocol that requires only $n\\n+ O(\\\\log n)$ states. Our protocol stabilizes in $O(n^2\\\\log n)$ interactions\\nw.h.p.\\\\ and in expectation, using $n + O(\\\\log^2 n)$ states in total. Our\\nstabilization time is asymptotically optimal (see Burman et al., PODC'21). In\\ncomparison to the currently best known ranking protocol by Burman et al., which\\nrequires $n + \\\\Omega(n)$ states, our result exponentially improves the number\\nof overhead states.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:04:19Z\"}"}
