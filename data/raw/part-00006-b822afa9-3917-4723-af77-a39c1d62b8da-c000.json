Non-Stabilizerness in Molecular Bonding\", \"summary\": \"Isolated atoms as well as molecules at equilibrium are presumed to be simple\\nfrom the point of view of quantum computational complexity. Here we show that\\nthe process of chemical bond formation is accompanied by a marked increase in\\nthe quantum complexity of the electronic ground state. By studying the hydrogen\\ndimer H$_{2}$ as a prototypical example, we demonstrate that when two hydrogen\\natoms form a bond, a specific measure of quantum complexity exhibits a\\npronounced peak that closely follows the behavior of the binding energy. This\\nmeasure of quantum complexity, known as magic in the quantum information\\nliterature, reflects how difficult it is to simulate the state using classical\\nmethods. This observation suggests that regions of strong bonding formation or\\nbreaking are also regions of enhanced intrinsic quantum complexity. This\\ninsight suggests a connection of quantum information measures to chemical\\nreactivity and advocates the use of stretched molecules as a quantum\\ncomputational resource.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T08:14:27Z\"}"}
