While\\nlogical axioms are a cornerstone of ontology design, natural language elements\\nsuch as annotations are equally critical for conveying intended meaning and\\nensuring consistent term usage. This paper explores how meaning is represented\\nin ontologies and how it can be effectively represented and communicated,\\naddressing challenges such as indeterminacy of reference and meaning holism. To\\nthis end, it proposes an approach founded on the use of a new structure, named\\n'ontological component' and defined by: a term-centered design; enhanced\\ncharacterization of both formal and natural language statements; an\\noperationalizable definition of communicated meaning based on general\\nassertions; and the integration of natural language elements into the logical\\ntheory. By formalizing the meaning of ontological components, this work seeks\\nto enhance the semantic robustness of terms, improving their clarity and\\naccessibility across domains. Furthermore, it aims to address practical\\nchallenges in applied ontologies, such as facilitating reuse and managing\\nversioning, thereby strengthening their role in diverse applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.FL\", \"categories\": \"cs.FL,cs.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T16:24:12Z\"}"}
