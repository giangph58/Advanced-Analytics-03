It was found that the valency\\nof the predicates is the underlying factor behind the trade-off relation\\nbetween MDD and MHD in Japanese. Native speakers of Japanese regulate the\\nlinear complexity and hierarchical complexity through the valency of the\\npredicates, and the relative sizes of MDD and MHD depend on whether the\\nthreshold of valency has been reached. Apart from the cognitive load, the\\nvalency of the predicates also affects the probability distributions of DD and\\nHD. The effect of the valency of the predicates on the distribution of HD is\\ngreater than on that of DD, which leads to differences in their probability\\ndistributions and causes the mean of MDD to be lower than that of MHD.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T08:27:33Z\"}"}
