However, some empty object positions seem to be\\nincompatible with extant empty categories. Given this, Li (2007a, 2007b, 2014)\\nand Li & Wei (2014) raise the true empty category hypothesis, which holds that\\ntrue empty category is only an empty position with category and Case features.\\nAs a last resort option, it is used mainly to meet the subcatgorization of a\\nverb. This assumption is ingenious, and if proved to be true, it will exert a\\ngreat impact on the study of UG. In this paper, we evaluate their evidence from\\ntopicalization and demonstrate that it can be accounted for without invoking\\ntrue empty category.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T15:22:21Z\"}"}
