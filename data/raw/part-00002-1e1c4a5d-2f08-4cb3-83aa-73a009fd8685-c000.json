{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07411v1\", \"title\": \"Estimand framework development for eGFR slope estimation and comparative\\n  analyses across various estimation methods\", \"summary\": \"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health challenge characterized by\\nprogressive kidney function decline, often culminating in end-stage kidney\\ndisease (ESKD) and increased mortality. To address the limitations such as the\\nextended trial follow-up necessitated by the low incidence of kidney composite\\nendpoint, the eGFR slope -- a surrogate endpoint reflecting the trajectory of\\nkidney function decline -- has gained prominence for its predictive power and\\nregulatory support. Despite its advantages, the lack of a standardized\\nframework for eGFR slope estimand and estimation complicates consistent\\ninterpretation and cross-trial comparisons. Existing methods, including simple\\nlinear regression and mixed-effects models, vary in their underlying\\nassumptions, creating a need for a formalized approach to align estimation\\nmethods with trial objectives. This manuscript proposes an estimand framework\\ntailored to eGFR slope-based analyses in CKD RCTs, ensuring clarity in defining\\n\\\"what to estimate\\\" and enhancing the comparability of results. Through\\nsimulation studies and real-world data applications, we evaluate the\\nperformance of various commonly applied estimation techniques under distinct\\nscenarios. By recommending a clear characterization for eGFR slope estimand and\\nproviding considerations for estimation approaches, this work aims to improve\\nthe reliability and interpretability of CKD trial results, advancing\\ntherapeutic development and clinical decision-making.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T03:03:31Z\"}"}
