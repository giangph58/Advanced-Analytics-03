{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07551v1\", \"title\": \"Topology optimization of decoupling feeding networks for antenna arrays\", \"summary\": \"Near-field and radiation coupling between nearby radiating elements is\\nunavoidable, and it is considered a limiting factor for applications in\\nwireless communications and active sensing. This article proposes a\\ndensity-based topology optimization approach to design decoupling networks for\\nsuch systems. The decoupling networks are designed based on a multi-objective\\noptimization problem with the radiating elements replaced by their time-domain\\nimpulse response for efficient computations and to enable the solution of the\\ndesign problem using gradient-based optimization methods. We use the\\nadjoint-field method to compute the gradients of the optimization objectives.\\nAdditionally, nonlinear filters are applied during the optimization procedure\\nto impose minimum-size control on the optimized designs. We demonstrate the\\nconcept by designing the decoupling network for a two-element planar antenna\\narray; the antenna is designed in a separate optimization problem. The\\noptimized decoupling networks provide a signal path that destructively\\ninterferes with the coupling between the radiating elements while preserving\\ntheir individual matching to the feeding ports. Compact decoupling networks\\ncapable of suppressing the mutual coupling by more than 10 dB between two\\nclosely separated planar antennas operating around 2.45 GHz are presented and\\nvalidated experimentally.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T08:27:04Z\"}"}
