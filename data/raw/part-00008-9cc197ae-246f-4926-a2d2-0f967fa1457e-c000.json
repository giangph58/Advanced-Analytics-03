{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12820v1\", \"title\": \"Skewness as a Probe of Gravity: Real and Redshift Space Counts-In-Cells\", \"summary\": \"We study the counts-in-cells reduced skewness $s_3$ for dark matter, halo,\\nand galaxy distributions in both real and redshift space, using the ELEPHANT\\n($\\\\textit{Extended LEnsing PHysics with ANalytical ray Tracing}$) suite of\\n$N$-body simulations. We compare General Relativity (GR) with two extended (EG)\\ngravity models: $f(R)$ gravity with chameleon screening and the normal-branch\\nDvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (nDGP) model with Vainshtein screening. We quantify the\\nsuppression of $s_3$ by redshift-space distortions (RSD), finding that while\\nsmall-scale skewness is strongly reduced, the $F5$ model retains a $\\\\sim 4\\\\%$\\ndeviation from GR in galaxy samples, corresponding to a $2\\\\sigma$ significance.\\nWe show that the ratio $s_3^{\\\\mathrm{RSD}}/s_3^{\\\\mathrm{real}}$ is\\napproximately independent of the gravity model across tracers and redshifts.\\nOur results demonstrate that real-space predictions can help reliably infer\\nredshift-space skewness in both GR and extended gravity, providing a new tool\\nfor testing gravity with current and forthcoming galaxy redshift surveys.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T10:25:11Z\"}"}
