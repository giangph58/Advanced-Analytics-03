This paper introduces\\nthe MCP Gateway to simplify self-hosted MCP server integration. The proposed\\narchitecture integrates security principles, authentication, intrusion\\ndetection, and secure tunneling, enabling secure self-hosting without exposing\\ninfrastructure. Key contributions include a reference architecture, threat\\nmodel mapping, simplified integration strategies, and open-source\\nimplementation recommendations. This work focuses on the unique challenges of\\nenterprise-centric, self-hosted AI integrations, unlike existing public MCP\\nserver solutions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:17:42Z\"}"}
