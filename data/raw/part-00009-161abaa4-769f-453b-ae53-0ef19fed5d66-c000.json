This problem is known as absolute auditory attention decoding\\n(aAAD). We propose an unsupervised discriminative CCA model for feature\\nextraction and combine it with an unsupervised classifier called minimally\\ninformed linear discriminant analysis (MILDA) for aAAD classification.\\nRemarkably, the proposed unsupervised algorithm performs significantly better\\nthan a state-of-the-art supervised model. A key reason is that the unsupervised\\nalgorithm can successfully adapt to the non-stationary test data at a low\\ncomputational cost. This opens the door to the analysis of the auditory\\nattention of a subject using EEG signals with a model that automatically tunes\\nitself to the subject without requiring an arduous supervised training session\\nbeforehand.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP,cs.SD\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T16:36:56Z\"}"}
