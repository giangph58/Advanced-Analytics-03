{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15123v1\", \"title\": \"Squeezing Effect in the Gouy Phase of Matter Waves\", \"summary\": \"We investigate the Gouy phase emerging from the time evolution of confined\\nmatter waves in a harmonic potential. Specifically, we analyze the quantum\\ndynamics of a Gaussian wavepacket that exhibits position--momentum\\ncorrelations. By tuning the parameters governing its evolution, we reveal\\nintriguing effects, with a particular focus on squeezing. Notably, during the\\nwavepacket evolution quantum spreading and squeezing processes emerge, giving\\nrise to Gouy phase contributions of $\\\\pi/4$ rad, establishing a clear link\\nbetween the Gouy phase and a purely quantum phenomenon. Furthermore, the\\ninterplay between wavepacket squeezing and one-dimensional spreading leads to a\\ntotal Gouy phase accumulation of $\\\\pi/2$ rad in an oscillation period. Both\\nsqueezing and Gouy phase have individually proven valuable in state engineering\\nand quantum metrology. By demonstrating a direct, controllable relationship\\nbetween these two fundamental processes, our findings expand the realm of\\nquantum-enhanced technologies, including quantum sensing and precision\\nmeasurement.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T14:19:36Z\"}"}
