{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21622v1\", \"title\": \"Path Planning on Multi-level Point Cloud with a Weighted Traversability\\n  Graph\", \"summary\": \"This article proposes a new path planning method for addressing multi-level\\nterrain situations. The proposed method includes innovations in three aspects:\\n1) the pre-processing of point cloud maps with a multi-level skip-list\\nstructure and data-slimming algorithm for well-organized and simplified map\\nformalization and management, 2) the direct acquisition of local traversability\\nindexes through vehicle and point cloud interaction analysis, which saves work\\nin surface fitting, and 3) the assignment of traversability indexes on a\\nmulti-level connectivity graph to generate a weighted traversability graph for\\ngenerally search-based path planning. The A* algorithm is modified to utilize\\nthe traversability graph to generate a short and safe path. The effectiveness\\nand reliability of the proposed method are verified through indoor and outdoor\\nexperiments conducted in various environments, including multi-floor buildings,\\nwoodland, and rugged mountainous regions. The results demonstrate that the\\nproposed method can properly address 3D path planning problems for ground\\nvehicles in a wide range of situations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T13:24:53Z\"}"}
