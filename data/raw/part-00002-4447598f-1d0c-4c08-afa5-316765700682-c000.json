{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06913v1\", \"title\": \"Controlling a Social Network of Individuals with Coevolving Actions and\\n  Opinions\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we consider a population of individuals who have actions and\\nopinions, which coevolve, mutually influencing one another on a complex network\\nstructure. In particular, we formulate a control problem for this social\\nnetwork, in which we assume that we can inject into the network a committed\\nminority -- a set of stubborn nodes -- with the objective of steering the\\npopulation, initially at a consensus, to a different consensus state. Our study\\nfocuses on two main objectives: i) determining the conditions under which the\\ncommitted minority succeeds in its goal, and ii) identifying the optimal\\nplacement for such a committed minority. After deriving general monotone\\nconvergence result for the controlled dynamics, we leverage these results to\\nbuild a computationally-efficient algorithm to solve the first problem and an\\neffective heuristics for the second problem, which we prove to be NP-complete.\\nThe proposed methodology is illustrated though academic examples, and\\ndemonstrated on a real-world case study.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY,math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:20:46Z\"}"}
