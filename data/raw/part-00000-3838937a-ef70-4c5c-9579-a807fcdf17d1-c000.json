This infinite-dimensional space has appeared in the study of\\nHermitian-Einstein structures, where a special L2-type Riemannian metric is\\nintroduced. We compute the metric spray, geodesics and curvature associated to\\nthis metric, and show that the exponential map is a diffeomorphsim. Though\\nbeing geodesically complete, the space of Hermitian metrics is metrically\\nincomplete, and its metric completion is proved to be the space of L2\\nintegrable singular Hermitian metrics. In addition, both the original space and\\nits completion are CAT(0). In the holomorphic case, it turns out that Griffiths\\nseminegative/semipositive singular Hermitian metric is always L2 integrable in\\nour sense. Also, in the Appendix, the Nash-Moser inverse function theorem is\\nused to prove that, for any L2 metric on the space of smooth sections of a\\ngiven fiber bundle, the exponential map is always a local diffeomorphism,\\nprovided that each fiber is nonpositively curved.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T06:12:40Z\"}"}
