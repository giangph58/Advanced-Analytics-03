{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11156v1\", \"title\": \"A preliminary cosmological analysis of stellar population synthesis of\\n  galaxies released by LAMOST LRS DR11\", \"summary\": \"The evolution of the universe together with the galaxies is one of the\\nfundamental issues that we humans are most interested in. Both the observations\\nof tidal streams from SDSS and the theory of $\\\\Lambda$CDM support the\\nhierarchical merging theory. The study of high redshift celestial bodies\\ncontributes to a more in-depth study of cosmology. The LAMOST low resolution\\nsearch catalog DR11 v1.0 has released 11,939,296 spectra, including 11,581,542\\nstars, 275,302 galaxies, and 82,452 quasars, and so on. The data of 28,780\\nstellar population synthesis of galaxies and some high redshift quasars are\\nused to do a preliminary statistical research. We selected the data with small\\nerrors for analysis and obtained some basic statistical conclusions. Older\\ngalaxies have relatively larger stellar velocity dispersions. The larger the\\nmetallicity, the greater the stellar velocity dispersion. These statistical\\nresults are reasonable and consistent with previous work. Because the stellar\\nvelocity dispersion is driven by the total mass of a galaxy at the first order\\nand more massive galaxies have older ages and greater metallicities. The\\nspectra of high redshift quasars show clear Gunn-Peterson trough and\\nLyman-$\\\\alpha$ forest. The identified emission lines and high redshift\\ncelestial spectra released by LAMOST can be used for cosmological research.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T13:01:48Z\"}"}
