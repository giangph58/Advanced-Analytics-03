The random matrix theory shows\\nthat the divergence of the non-affine displacement field has large-scale\\nexponentially decaying correlations. The corresponding length scale $\\\\xi$ is\\ndetermined by the strength of the disorder and can be indefinitely large,\\nsignificantly exceeding the correlation length of the disorder. The rotor of\\nthe non-affine displacement field has the same length scale $\\\\xi$ except the\\ncase of the volumetric deformation. The main theoretical dependencies are\\nconfirmed by molecular dynamics simulation of a model polystyrene in the\\namorphous state.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T16:31:45Z\"}"}
