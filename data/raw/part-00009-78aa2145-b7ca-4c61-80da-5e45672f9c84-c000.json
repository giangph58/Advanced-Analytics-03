{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12287v1\", \"title\": \"Trend Filtered Mixture of Experts for Automated Gating of High-Frequency\\n  Flow Cytometry Data\", \"summary\": \"Ocean microbes are critical to both ocean ecosystems and the global climate.\\nFlow cytometry, which measures cell optical properties in fluid samples, is\\nroutinely used in oceanographic research. Despite decades of accumulated data,\\nidentifying key microbial populations (a process known as ``gating'') remains a\\nsignificant analytical challenge. To address this, we focus on gating\\nmultidimensional, high-frequency flow cytometry data collected {\\\\it\\ncontinuously} on board oceanographic research vessels, capturing time- and\\nspace-wise variations in the dynamic ocean. Our paper proposes a novel\\nmixture-of-experts model in which both the gating function and the experts are\\ngiven by trend filtering. The model leverages two key assumptions: (1) Each\\nsnapshot of flow cytometry data is a mixture of multivariate Gaussians and (2)\\nthe parameters of these Gaussians vary smoothly over time. Our method uses\\nregularization and a constraint to ensure smoothness and that cluster means\\nmatch biologically distinct microbe types. We demonstrate, using flow cytometry\\ndata from the North Pacific Ocean, that our proposed model accurately matches\\nhuman-annotated gating and corrects significant errors.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,stat.AP,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T17:51:59Z\"}"}
