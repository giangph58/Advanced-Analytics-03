{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07600v1\", \"title\": \"System Concept and Demonstration of Bistatic MIMO-OFDM-based ISAC\", \"summary\": \"In future sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks, radar sensing is expected to\\nbe offered as an additional service to its original purpose of communication.\\nMerging these two functions results in integrated sensing and communication\\n(ISAC) systems. In this context, bistatic ISAC appears as a possibility to\\nexploit the distributed nature of cellular networks while avoiding highly\\ndemanding hardware requirements such as full-duplex operation. Recent studies\\nhave introduced strategies to perform required synchronization and data\\nexchange between nodes for bistatic ISAC operation, based on orthogonal\\nfrequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), however, only for single-input\\nsingle-output architectures. In this article, a system concept for a bistatic\\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-OFDM-based ISAC system with beamforming\\nat both transmitter and receiver is proposed, and a distribution\\nsynchronization concept to ensure coherence among the different receive\\nchannels for direction-of-arrival estimation is presented. After a discussion\\non the ISAC processing chain, including relevant aspects for practical\\ndeployments such as transmitter digital pre-distortion and receiver\\ncalibration, a 4x8 MIMO measurement setup at 27.5 GHz and results are presented\\nto validate the proposed system and distribution synchronization concepts.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T09:54:15Z\"}"}
