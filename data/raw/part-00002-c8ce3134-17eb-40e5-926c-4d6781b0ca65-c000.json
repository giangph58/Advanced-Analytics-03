{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12280v1\", \"title\": \"On the range of validity of parabolic models for fluid flow through\\n  isotropic homogeneous porous media\", \"summary\": \"Lattice-Boltzmann methods are established mesoscopic numerical schemes for\\nfluid flow, that recover the evolution of macroscopic quantities (viz.,\\nvelocity and pressure fields) evolving under macroscopic target equations. The\\napproximated target equations for fluid flows are typically parabolic and\\ninclude a (weak) compressibility term. A number of Lattice-Boltzmann models\\ntargeting, or making use of, flow through porous media in the representative\\nelementary volume, have been successfully developed. However, apart from two\\nexceptions, the target equations are not reported, or the assumptions for and\\napproximations of these equations are not fully clarified. Within this work,\\nthe underlying assumption underpinning parabolic equations for porous flow in\\nthe representative elementary volume, are discussed, clarified and listed. It\\nis shown that the commonly-adopted assumption of negligible hydraulic\\ndispersion is not justifiable by clear argument - and in fact, that by not\\nadopting it, one can provide a qualitative and quantitative expression for the\\neffective viscosity in the Brinkman correction of Darcy law. Finally, it is\\nshown that, under certain conditions, it is possible to interpret porous models\\nas Euler-Euler multiphase models wherein one phase is the solid matrix.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T17:41:37Z\"}"}
