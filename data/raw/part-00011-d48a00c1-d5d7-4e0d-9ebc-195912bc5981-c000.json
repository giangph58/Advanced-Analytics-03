{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06091v1\", \"title\": \"Real-Time LaCAM\", \"summary\": \"The vast majority of Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) methods with\\ncompleteness guarantees require planning full horizon paths. However, planning\\nfull horizon paths can take too long and be impractical in real-world\\napplications. Instead, real-time planning and execution, which only allows the\\nplanner a finite amount of time before executing and replanning, is more\\npractical for real world multi-agent systems. Several methods utilize real-time\\nplanning schemes but none are provably complete, which leads to livelock or\\ndeadlock. Our main contribution is to show the first Real-Time MAPF method with\\nprovable completeness guarantees. We do this by leveraging LaCAM (Okumura 2023)\\nin an incremental fashion. Our results show how we can iteratively plan for\\ncongested environments with a cutoff time of milliseconds while still\\nmaintaining the same success rate as full horizon LaCAM. We also show how it\\ncan be used with a single-step learned MAPF policy. The proposed Real-Time\\nLaCAM also provides us with a general mechanism for using iterative constraints\\nfor completeness in future real-time MAPF algorithms.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MA\", \"categories\": \"cs.MA,cs.AI,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:31:05Z\"}"}
