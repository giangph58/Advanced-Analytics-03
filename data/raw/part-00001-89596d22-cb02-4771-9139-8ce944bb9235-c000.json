Inspired by twisted boundary conditions in equilibrium systems, this\\napproach modifies the temporal evolution of the system upon completing a\\nspatial loop, enabling the identification of distinct Floquet phases, including\\ndiscrete time crystals (DTCs). By studying the spectral form factor (SFF) and\\nits response to the twist, we uncover signatures of time-crystalline order,\\nwhich exhibits periodic dependence on the twist parameter analogous to the\\nLittle-Parks effect in superconductors. We apply this framework to the kicked\\nIsing model, demonstrating that our twist can distinguish time-crystalline\\nphases.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T09:29:36Z\"}"}
