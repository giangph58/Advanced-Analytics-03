In this work, we extend the\\nuniversal relation proposed by Goon and Penco by deriving a generalized form\\nwhere entropy is not just the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Our analysis treats\\nentropy as a general function of the horizon radius, and with the help of that,\\nwe formulate the generalized universal relation. We show that, in the case of\\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy, the generalized relation coincides with the\\noriginal universal relation by Goon and Penco. Furthermore, we explore the\\nimplications of logarithmic and exponential corrections to entropy and test the\\nvalidity of the generalized universal relation under these modifications.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T07:12:53Z\"}"}
