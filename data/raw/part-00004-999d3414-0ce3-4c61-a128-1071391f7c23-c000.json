Motivated by\\nthe differential cross-section data for $\\\\gamma p \\\\to K^+ \\\\Sigma^0$ from CLAS\\n2010, which exhibits some bump structures at $W \\\\approx$ 1875, 2080 and 2270\\nMeV, we extend our previous analysis by investigating the effects of\\n$N(1535)1/2^-$, $N(1875)3/2^-$, $N(2080)1/2^- \\\\&\\\\ 3/2^-$ and $N(2270)1/2^- ,\\n3/2^- \\\\&\\\\ 5/2^-$, as strange partners of $P_c$ molecular states, in the\\nreactions $\\\\gamma p \\\\to K^+ \\\\Sigma^0$ and $\\\\gamma p \\\\to K^0 \\\\Sigma^+$. The\\ntheoretical model employed in this study utilizes an effective Lagrangian\\napproach in the tree-level Born approximation. It contains the contributions\\nfrom $s$-channel with exchanges of $N$, $\\\\Delta$, $N^*$ (including the hadronic\\nmolecules with hidden strangeness), and $\\\\Delta^*$; $t$-channel; $u$-channel;\\nand the generalized contact term. The results corresponding to the final fitted\\nparameters are in good agreement with all available experimental data of both\\ncross-sections and polarization observables for $\\\\gamma p \\\\to K^+ \\\\Sigma^0$ and\\n$\\\\gamma p \\\\to K^0 \\\\Sigma^+$. Notably, the $s$-channel exchanges of molecules\\nsignificantly contribute to the bump structures in cross-sections for $\\\\gamma p\\n\\\\to K \\\\Sigma$ at $W \\\\approx$ 1900, 2080 and 2270 MeV, and show considerable\\ncoherence with contributions from $s$-channel exchanges of general resonances\\nto construct the overall structures of cross-sections. More abundant\\nexperiments, particularly for the reaction $\\\\gamma p \\\\to K^0 \\\\Sigma^+$, are\\nnecessary to further strengthen the constraints on the theoretical models.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T08:48:25Z\"}"}
