We present\\na generalisation of Dung's extension semantics as extension-ranking semantics,\\nwhich induce a preorder over the power set of all arguments, allowing us to\\nstate that one set is \\\"closer\\\" to being acceptable than another. To evaluate\\nthe extension-ranking semantics, we introduce a number of principles that a\\nwell-behaved extension-ranking semantics should satisfy. We consider several\\nsimple base relations, each of which models a single central aspect of\\nargumentative reasoning. The combination of these base relations provides us\\nwith a family of extension-ranking semantics. We also adapt a number of\\napproaches from the literature for ranking extensions to be usable in the\\ncontext of extension-ranking semantics, and evaluate their behaviour.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:19:42Z\"}"}
