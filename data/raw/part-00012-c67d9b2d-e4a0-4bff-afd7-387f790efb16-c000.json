The Role of Filament\\n  Mass\", \"summary\": \"The thorough understanding on the initiation of coronal mass ejections\\n(CMEs), which is manifested as a slow rise of pre-eruptive structures before\\nthe impulsive ejection in kinematics, is the key for forecasting the solar\\neruptions. In our previous work, we showed that the slow rise of a hot flux\\nrope with coronal mass density is caused by the moderate magnetic reconnection\\noccurring in the hyperbolic flux tube (HFT) combined with the torus\\ninstability. However, it remains unclear how the initiation process varies when\\na filament is present in the pre-eruptive flux rope. In this work, we reveal\\nthe complete initiation route of a CME containing filament mass with a\\nstate-of-the-art full-magnetohydrodynamics simulation. The comprehensive\\nanalyses show that the filament mass has an important impact on the CME\\ninitiation through triggering and driving the slow rise of flux rope with its\\ndrainage, besides the contributions of HFT reconnection and torus instability.\\nFinally, in combination with our previous work, we propose that the enhanced\\ndrainage of filament mass and various features related to the HFT reconnection,\\nsuch as, the split of pre-eruptive structure and the pre-flare loops and X-ray\\nemissions, can serve as the precursors of CME initiation in observations.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T06:06:24Z\"}"}
