In\\nnext-generation technologies, the demand for data has evolved beyond the\\nconventional log generation or export capabilities provided by existing\\nlicensed network monitoring tools. There is now a growing need to collect such\\ndata at specific time intervals and with defined granularities. At this stage,\\nthe development of real-time KPI extraction methods and enabling their exchange\\nbetween both standardized/commercialized and non-standardized components or\\ntools has become increasingly critical. This study presents a comprehensive\\nevaluation of three distinct KPI extraction methodologies applied to two\\ncommercially available devices. The analysis aims to uncover the strengths,\\nweaknesses, and overall efficacy of these approaches under varying conditions,\\nand highlights the critical insights into the practical capabilities and\\nlimitations. The findings serve as a foundational guide for the seamless\\nintegration and robust testing of novel technologies and approaches within\\ncommercial telecommunication networks. This work aspires to bridge the gap\\nbetween technological innovation and real-world applicability, fostering\\nenhanced decision-making in network deployment and optimization.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI,eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T17:04:02Z\"}"}
