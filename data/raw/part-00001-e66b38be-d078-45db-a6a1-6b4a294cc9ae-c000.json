{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07062v1\", \"title\": \"Universal neural wave functions for high-pressure hydrogen\", \"summary\": \"We leverage the power of neural quantum states to describe the ground state\\nwave function of solid and liquid dense hydrogen, including both electronic and\\nprotonic degrees of freedom. For static protons, the resulting Born-Oppenheimer\\nenergies are consistently lower than all previous projector Monte Carlo\\ncalculations for systems containing up to $128$ hydrogen atoms. In contrast to\\nconventional methods, we introduce a universal trial wave function whose\\nvariational parameters are optimized simultaneously over a large set of proton\\nconfigurations spanning a wide pressure-temperature spectrum and covering both\\nmolecular and atomic phases. This global optimization not only yields lower\\nenergies compared to benchmarks but also brings an enormous reduction in\\ncomputational cost. By including nuclear quantum effects in the\\nzero-temperature ground state, thus going beyond the Born-Oppenheimer\\napproximation, our description overcomes major limitations of current wave\\nfunctions, notably by avoiding any explicit symmetry assumption on the expected\\nquantum crystal and sidestepping efficiency issues of imaginary time evolution\\nwith disparate mass scales. As a first application, we examine crystal\\nformation in an extremely high-density region where pressure-induced melting is\\nexpected.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T17:26:35Z\"}"}
