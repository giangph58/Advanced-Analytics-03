Such properties are typically\\nassociated with structures requiring intricate fabrication processes, such as\\natomic contacts or hybrid junctions based on semiconducting nanowires and 2D\\nmaterials. In contrast, our approach relies solely on standard nanofabrication\\ntechniques. The resulting devices exhibit a key signature of high-transmission\\njunctions - Multiple Andreev Reflections (MAR) - in their current-voltage\\ncharacteristics. Furthermore, we propose a straightforward superconducting\\ncircuit design based on these junctions, enabling the implementation of a\\nparity-protected qubit.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T10:24:51Z\"}"}
