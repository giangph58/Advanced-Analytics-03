Closed expressions of values for all the\\ncomponents of the tuner are detailed, and tuner performance optimization is\\naddressed, resulting in a Figure of Merit measure of FE-FRT tuner performance\\nand use case applicability over a wide range of RF frequencies and reactive\\npower levels. This enables addressing feasibility and rapid assessment of\\ndesign parameters given an FE-FRT tuning scenario defined by required tuning\\nrange, cavity operating frequency a cavity stored energy.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.acc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.acc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:25:23Z\"}"}
