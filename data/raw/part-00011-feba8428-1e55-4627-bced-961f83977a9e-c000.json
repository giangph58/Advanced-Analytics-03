{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17266v1\", \"title\": \"Multipartite continuous-variable quantum nondemolition interaction and\\n  entanglement certification and monitoring\", \"summary\": \"The quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement is one of the most studied\\nquantum measurement procedures. Usually, such process involves the coupling of\\na single system of interest, called signal, with a single probe system, so that\\nthe relevant information in the signal system is indirectly measured by\\nobserving the probe system. Here, we extend the concept of quantum\\nnondemolition interaction to the cases in which the signal and the probe\\nsystems are each one multipartite continuous-variable systems. Specifically, we\\npropose a general scheme that performs the multipartite QND interactions,\\nrelying on beam-splitter couplings among the signal and probe modes with\\nancillary modes prepared off-line in squeezed states. The scheme is also\\ncomposed by homodyne detections and feedforward modulations. The ancillary\\nmodes are detected in the process, providing photocurrents for post-modulation\\nof the output systems, as well as sufficient information to calculate genuine\\nmultipartite entanglement conditions of the input systems and to monitor\\nsimilar conditions of the output systems.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T05:51:53Z\"}"}
