{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15783v1\", \"title\": \"Towards prediction of morphological heart age from computed tomography\\n  angiography\", \"summary\": \"Age prediction from medical images or other health-related non-imaging data\\nis an important approach to data-driven aging research, providing knowledge of\\nhow much information a specific tissue or organ carries about the chronological\\nage of the individual. In this work, we studied the prediction of age from\\ncomputed tomography angiography (CTA) images, which provide detailed\\nrepresentations of the heart morphology, with the goals of (i) studying the\\nrelationship between morphology and aging, and (ii) developing a novel\\n\\\\emph{morphological heart age} biomarker. We applied an image\\nregistration-based method that standardizes the images from the whole cohort\\ninto a single space. We then extracted supervoxels (using unsupervised\\nsegmentation), and corresponding robust features of density and local volume,\\nwhich provide a detailed representation of the heart morphology while being\\nrobust to registration errors. Machine learning models are then trained to fit\\nregression models from these features to the chronological age. We applied the\\nmethod to a subset of the images from the Swedish CArdioPulomonary bioImage\\nStudy (SCAPIS) dataset, consisting of 721 females and 666 males. We observe a\\nmean absolute error of $2.74$ years for females and $2.77$ years for males. The\\npredictions from different sub-regions of interest were observed to be more\\nhighly correlated with the predictions from the whole heart, compared to the\\nchronological age, revealing a high consistency in the predictions from\\nmorphology. Saliency analysis was also performed on the prediction models to\\nstudy what regions are associated positively and negatively with the predicted\\nage. This resulted in detailed association maps where the density and volume of\\nknown, as well as some novel sub-regions of interest, are determined to be\\nimportant. The saliency analysis aids in the interpretability of the models and\\ntheir predictions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T10:48:27Z\"}"}
