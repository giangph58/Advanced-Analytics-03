Recent reports\\nsuggest that the key solution is to migrate to memory-safe languages. To this\\nend, C-to-Rust transpilation becomes popular to resolve memory-safety issues in\\nC programs. Recent works propose C-to-Rust transpilation frameworks; however, a\\ncomprehensive evaluation dataset is missing. Although one solution is to put\\ntogether a large enough dataset, this increases the analysis time in automated\\nframeworks as well as in manual efforts for some cases. In this work, we build\\na method to select functions from a large set to construct a minimized yet\\nrepresentative dataset to evaluate the C-to-Rust transpilation. We propose\\nC2RUST-BENCH that contains 2,905 functions, which are representative of\\nC-to-Rust transpilation, selected from 15,503 functions of real-world programs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.AI,cs.PL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T14:48:45Z\"}"}
