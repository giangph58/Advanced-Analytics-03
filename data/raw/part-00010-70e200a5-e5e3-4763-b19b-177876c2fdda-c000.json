{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19974v1\", \"title\": \"Modelling collective cell migration in a data-rich age: challenges and\\n  opportunities for data-driven modelling\", \"summary\": \"Mathematical modelling has a long history in the context of collective cell\\nmigration, with applications throughout development, disease and regenerative\\nmedicine. The aim of modelling in this context is to provide a framework in\\nwhich to mathematically encode experimentally derived mechanistic hypotheses,\\nand then to test and validate them to provide new insights and understanding.\\nTraditionally, mathematical models have consisted of systems of partial\\ndifferential equations that model the evolution of cell density over time,\\ntogether with the dynamics of any associated biochemical signals or the\\nunderlying substrate. The various terms in the model are usually chosen to\\nprovide simplified, phenomenological descriptions of the underlying biology,\\nand follow long-standing conventions in the field. However, with the recent\\ndevelopment of a plethora of new experimental technologies that provide\\nquantitative data on collective cell migration processes, we now have the\\nopportunity to leverage statistical and machine learning tools to determine\\nmathematical models directly from the data. This perspectives article aims to\\nprovide an overview of recently developed data-driven modelling approaches,\\noutlining the main methodologies and the challenges involved in using them to\\ninterrogate real-world data relating to collective cell migration.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.QM\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.QM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:48:09Z\"}"}
