{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10005v1\", \"title\": \"Session-based Recommender Systems: User Interest as a Stochastic Process\\n  in the Latent Space\", \"summary\": \"This paper jointly addresses the problem of data uncertainty, popularity\\nbias, and exposure bias in session-based recommender systems. We study the\\nsymptoms of this bias both in item embeddings and in recommendations. We\\npropose treating user interest as a stochastic process in the latent space and\\nproviding a model-agnostic implementation of this mathematical concept. The\\nproposed stochastic component consists of elements: debiasing item embeddings\\nwith regularization for embedding uniformity, modeling dense user interest from\\nsession prefixes, and introducing fake targets in the data to simulate extended\\nexposure. We conducted computational experiments on two popular benchmark\\ndatasets, Diginetica and YooChoose 1/64, as well as several modifications of\\nthe YooChoose dataset with different ratios of popular items. The results show\\nthat the proposed approach allows us to mitigate the challenges mentioned.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.IR,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:08:40Z\"}"}
