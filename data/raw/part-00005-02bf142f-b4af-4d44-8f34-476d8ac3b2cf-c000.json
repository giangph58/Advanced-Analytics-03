We here demonstrate\\nthat the planetary albedo of an observed exoplanet is limited by the\\nabove-cloud atmosphere - the region of the atmosphere that is probed in remote\\nobservation. We derive an analytic model to explore how the maximum planetary\\nalbedo depends on the above-cloud optical depth and scattering versus absorbing\\nproperties, even in the limit of a perfectly reflective grey cloud layer. We\\napply this framework to sub-Neptune K2-18b, for which a high planetary albedo\\nhas recently been invoked to argue for the possibility of maintaining a liquid\\nwater ocean surface, despite K2-18b receiving an energy flux from its host star\\nthat places it inside of its estimated `habitable zone' inner edge. We use a\\nnumerical multiple-scattering line-by-line radiative transfer model to retrieve\\nthe albedo of K2-18b based on the observational constraints from the\\nabove-cloud atmosphere. Our results demonstrate that K2-18b's observed\\ntransmission spectrum already restricts its possible planetary albedo to values\\nbelow the threshold required to be potentially habitable, with the data\\nfavouring a median planetary albedo of 0.17-0.18. Our results thus reveal that\\ncurrently characteriseable sub-Neptunes are likely to be magma-ocean or\\ngas-dwarf worlds. The methods that we present are generally applicable to\\nconstrain the planetary albedo of any exoplanet with measurements of its\\nobservable atmosphere, enabling the quantification of potential exoplanet\\nhabitability with current observational capabilities.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T12:39:54Z\"}"}
