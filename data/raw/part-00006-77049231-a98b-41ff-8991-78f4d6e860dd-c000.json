Building on the\\nproperties of quaternionic quantum states, we define quaternionic analogues of\\nPauli operators and quantum gates, ensuring inner product preservation and\\nHilbert space conditions. A simple encoding scheme maps logical qubits into\\nquaternionic systems, introducing natural redundancy and enhanced resilience\\nagainst noise. We construct a quaternionic extension of the five-qubit code,\\nintroducing a framework of 15 syndrome measurements to detect quaternionic\\nerrors, including quaternionically rotated error components. Numerical\\nestimates show that the quaternionic five-qubit code achieves a logical error\\nthreshold of approximately $p_{th} \\\\approx 0.015$, demonstrating improved\\nperformance compared to the standard complex-valued code. These results suggest\\na new pathway for quantum error correction in high-noise environments,\\nleveraging the richer structure of quaternionic quantum mechanics to improve\\nfault tolerance.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:34:57Z\"}"}
