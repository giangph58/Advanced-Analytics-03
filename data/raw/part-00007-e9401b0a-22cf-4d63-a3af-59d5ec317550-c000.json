We establish\\nthe fibrewise basic dihomotopy invariance of directed parametrized topological\\ncomplexity and explore its relationship with the parametrized topological\\ncomplexity. In addition, we introduce the concept of the directed\\nLusternik$-$Schnirelmann (LS) category, prove its basic dihomotopy invariance,\\nand investigate its connections with both directed topological complexity and\\ndirected parametrized topological complexity. As an application, we show that\\nthe directed LS category of the directed spheres is equal to two.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AT\", \"categories\": \"math.AT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:47:09Z\"}"}
