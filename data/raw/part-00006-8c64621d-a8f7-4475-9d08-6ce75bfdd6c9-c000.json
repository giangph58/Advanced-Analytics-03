{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07827v1\", \"title\": \"HarmonySeg: Tubular Structure Segmentation with Deep-Shallow Feature\\n  Fusion and Growth-Suppression Balanced Loss\", \"summary\": \"Accurate segmentation of tubular structures in medical images, such as\\nvessels and airway trees, is crucial for computer-aided diagnosis,\\nradiotherapy, and surgical planning. However, significant challenges exist in\\nalgorithm design when faced with diverse sizes, complex topologies, and (often)\\nincomplete data annotation of these structures. We address these difficulties\\nby proposing a new tubular structure segmentation framework named HarmonySeg.\\nFirst, we design a deep-to-shallow decoder network featuring flexible\\nconvolution blocks with varying receptive fields, which enables the model to\\neffectively adapt to tubular structures of different scales. Second, to\\nhighlight potential anatomical regions and improve the recall of small tubular\\nstructures, we incorporate vesselness maps as auxiliary information. These maps\\nare aligned with image features through a shallow-and-deep fusion module, which\\nsimultaneously eliminates unreasonable candidates to maintain high precision.\\nFinally, we introduce a topology-preserving loss function that leverages\\ncontextual and shape priors to balance the growth and suppression of tubular\\nstructures, which also allows the model to handle low-quality and incomplete\\nannotations. Extensive quantitative experiments are conducted on four public\\ndatasets. The results show that our model can accurately segment 2D and 3D\\ntubular structures and outperform existing state-of-the-art methods. External\\nvalidation on a private dataset also demonstrates good generalizability.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:04:42Z\"}"}
