{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19550v1\", \"title\": \"Deployment Optimization for XL-IRS Assisted Multi-User Communications\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we study the deployment optimization for an extremely\\nlarge-scale intelligent reflecting surface (XL-IRS) assisted multi-user\\ncommunication system, within which the channels between the XL-IRS and the BS\\n(or user) are modeled by the near-field spherical wavefronts. To draw some\\nvaluable insights, we first consider the single-user case, where an alternating\\noptimization (AO) based algorithm is devised to maximize the received\\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the user. To address the high computational\\ncomplexity issue incurred by the AO based algorithm, three approximate received\\nSNR expressions are obtained to yield useful insights, corresponding to the\\nupper bound, approximate expression, and closed-form. It is demonstrated that\\nthe XL-IRS ought to be positioned near the user (rather than the BS) to obtain\\na higher beamforming gain. Then, for the multi-user scenario, an efficient\\nalgorithm is proposed to obtain a high-quality XL-IRS placement solution by\\nusing the AO and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Furthermore,\\nthe effective degree of freedom (DoF) of the BS-IRS channel is provided, which\\nindicates that the additional effective DoF can be leveraged to improve\\nmulti-user spatial multiplexing. Last, numerical results confirm the existence\\nof a trade-off between near-field beam-focusing gain and multiplexing gain.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T07:57:14Z\"}"}
