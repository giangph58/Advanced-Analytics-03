{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12770v1\", \"title\": \"Comparative Analysis of POX and RYU SDN Controllers in Scalable Networks\", \"summary\": \"This paper explores the Quality of Service (QoS) performance of two widely\\nused Software-Defined Networking (SDN) controllers, POX and Ryu, using Mininet\\nfor network simulation. SDN, a transformative approach to network architecture,\\nseparates the control and data planes, enabling centralized management,\\nimproved agility, and cost-effective solutions. The study evaluates key QoS\\nparameters, including throughput, delay, and jitter, to understand the\\ncapabilities and limitations of the POX and Ryu controllers in handling traffic\\nunder diverse network topologies. The research employs a systematic methodology\\ninvolving the design of custom network topologies, implementation of OpenFlow\\nrules, and analysis of controller behavior under simulated conditions. Results\\nreveal that while POX offers simplicity and ease of use, making it suitable for\\nsmaller-scale applications and experimentation, Ryu provides superior\\nscalability and adaptability for more complex network environments. The\\nfindings highlight the strengths and challenges of each controller, providing\\nvaluable insights for organizations seeking to optimize SDN deployment. This\\nstudy contributes to the growing body of knowledge on SDN technologies and\\ntheir role in building scalable, efficient, and resilient network\\ninfrastructures.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T09:09:56Z\"}"}
