In this work, we propose BARIS-Decoder\\n(Boundary-Aware Refinement Decoder for Instance Segmentation), a framework that\\nenhances segmentation accuracy through feature refinement. To address\\nunderwater degradations, we introduce the Environmental Robust Adapter (ERA),\\nwhich efficiently models underwater degradation patterns while reducing\\ntrainable parameters by over 90\\\\% compared to full fine-tuning. The integration\\nof BARIS-Decoder with ERA-tuning, referred to as BARIS-ERA, achieves\\nstate-of-the-art performance, surpassing Mask R-CNN by 3.4 mAP with a Swin-B\\nbackbone and 3.8 mAP with ConvNeXt V2. Our findings demonstrate the\\neffectiveness of BARIS-ERA in advancing underwater instance segmentation,\\nproviding a robust and efficient solution.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T10:00:22Z\"}"}
