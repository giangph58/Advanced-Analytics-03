However, the co-designs\\nbetween the two were often undervalued or failed to realize their full\\npotential.\\n  This paper proposes K2, a multi-region data store that intensely explores the\\nopportunity of using TTC for distributed transactions. Compared to its pioneer,\\nGoogle Spanner, K2 augments TTC's semantics in three core design pillars.\\nFirst, K2 carries a new timestamp-generating scheme that is capable of\\nproviding a small time uncertainty bound at scale. Second, K2 revitalizes\\nexisting multi-version timestamp-ordered concurrency control to realize\\nmulti-version properties for read-write transactions. Third, K2 introduces a\\nnew TTC-based visibility control protocol that provides efficient reads at\\nreplicas. Our evaluation shows that, K2 achieves an order of magnitude higher\\ntransaction throughput relative to other practical geo-distributed transaction\\nprotocols while ensuring a lower visibility delay at asynchronous replicas.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DB\", \"categories\": \"cs.DB\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:17:11Z\"}"}
