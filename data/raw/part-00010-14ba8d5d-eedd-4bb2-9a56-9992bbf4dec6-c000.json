We discuss a rigorous definition of such operator square\\nroots and show well-posedness of the pseudodifferential parabolic equation by\\nusing the theory of strongly continuous semigroups. This provides a\\njustification for a family of widely-used numerical methods for wavefield\\nsimulations in various areas of physics.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ao-ph,math.AP,math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T07:52:48Z\"}"}
