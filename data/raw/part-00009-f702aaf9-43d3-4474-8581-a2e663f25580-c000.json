{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10058v1\", \"title\": \"Data Cooperatives: Democratic Models for Ethical Data Stewardship\", \"summary\": \"Data cooperatives offer a new model for fair data governance, enabling\\nindividuals to collectively control, manage, and benefit from their information\\nwhile adhering to cooperative principles such as democratic member control,\\neconomic participation, and community concern. This paper reviews data\\ncooperatives, distinguishing them from models like data trusts, data commons,\\nand data unions, and defines them based on member ownership, democratic\\ngovernance, and data sovereignty. It explores applications in sectors like\\nhealthcare, agriculture, and construction. Despite their potential, data\\ncooperatives face challenges in coordination, scalability, and member\\nengagement, requiring innovative governance strategies, robust technical\\nsystems, and mechanisms to align member interests with cooperative goals. The\\npaper concludes by advocating for data cooperatives as a sustainable,\\ndemocratic, and ethical model for the future data economy.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SI\", \"categories\": \"cs.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T10:01:07Z\"}"}
