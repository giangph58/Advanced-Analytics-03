Our\\nBayesian framework addresses the fundamental challenge of reconciling\\njudgmental narrative approaches with statistical forecasting. Analysis\\nevaluates explicit measures of concordance of scenarios with a reference\\nforecasting model, delivers Bayesian predictive synthesis of the scenarios to\\nbest match that reference, and addresses scenario set incompleteness. This\\nunderlies systematic evaluation and integration of risks from different\\nscenarios, and quantifies relative support for scenarios modulo the defined\\nreference forecasts. The framework offers advances in forecasting in policy\\ninstitutions that supports clear and rigorous communication of evolving risks.\\nWe also discuss broader questions of integrating judgmental information with\\nstatistical model-based forecasts in the face of unexpected circumstances.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.EM\", \"categories\": \"econ.EM,stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T12:47:49Z\"}"}
