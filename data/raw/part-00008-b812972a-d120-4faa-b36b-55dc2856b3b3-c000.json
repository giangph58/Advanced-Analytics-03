We intend\\nto (partially) bridge the gap between them while expanding the boundary of\\ntheoretical knowledge on the B&B framework. Branch-and-bound algorithms\\ntypically guarantee that an optimal solution is eventually found. However, we\\nshow that the standard implementation of branch-and-bound for certain knapsack\\nand scheduling problems also exhibits PTAS-like behavior, yielding increasingly\\nbetter solutions within polynomial time. Our findings are supported by\\ncomputational experiments and comparisons with benchmark methods.
