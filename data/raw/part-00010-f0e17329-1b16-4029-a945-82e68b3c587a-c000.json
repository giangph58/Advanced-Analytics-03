This idea is almost as old as\\nmodern robotics. Yet, while diverse general-purpose reasoning architectures\\nhave been proposed since, general-purpose systems that are integrated with\\nmodern robotic platforms have emerged only recently, starting with the\\ninfluential ROSPlan system. Since then, a growing number of model-based systems\\nfor robot task-level control have emerged. In this paper, we consider the\\ndiverse design choices and issues existing systems attempt to address, the\\ndifferent solutions proposed so far, and suggest avenues for future\\ndevelopment.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T15:17:38Z\"}"}
