Here, we develop an accurate semiclassical\\napproach that provides direct and efficient access to the phase-space-resolved\\nquantum Fisher information (QFI), the central quantity that quantifies the\\nultimate achievable sensitivity. This approximation reveals, in very concrete\\nterms, that the QFI is large whenever a specific dynamical quantity tied to the\\nsensing parameter displays a large variance over the course of the\\ncorresponding classical time evolution. Applied to a paradigmatic system of\\nquantum chaos, the kicked top, we show that the semiclassical description is\\naccurate already for modest quantum numbers, i.e. deep in the quantum regime,\\nand extends seamlessly to very high quantum numbers that are beyond the reach\\nof other methods.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T04:31:50Z\"}"}
