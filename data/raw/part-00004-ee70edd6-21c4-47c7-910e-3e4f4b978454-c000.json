We propose a unifying\\nframework for obtaining various duality results related to this property. The\\nabelian Rokhlin property coincides with the known Rokhlin property for actions\\nby the reals (i.e., flows), but is not identical to the known Rokhlin property\\nin general. The main duality result we obtain is a generalisation of a duality\\nfor flows proved by Kishimoto in the case of Kirchberg algebras. We consider\\nalso a slight weakening of the abelian Rokhlin property, which allows us to\\nshow that all traces on the crossed product C$^*$-algebra are canonically\\ninduced from invariant traces on the the coefficient C$^*$-algebra.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OA\", \"categories\": \"math.OA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T08:11:04Z\"}"}
