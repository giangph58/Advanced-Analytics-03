{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12674v1\", \"title\": \"Can spacetime fluctuations generate entanglement between co-moving\\n  accelerated detectors?\", \"summary\": \"Recent studies [Class. Quant. Grav. 42, 03LT01 (2025); Phys. Rev. D 111,\\n045023 (2025)] indicate that in a nested sequence of Rindler wedges, vacuum of\\nformer Rindler frame appears to be thermally populated for an observer in\\nshifted Rindler frame. Interestingly, this thermality is independent of shift\\nparameter as long as it is non-zero and therefore arises even if the shift\\nparameter is as small as Planck length. Building on this insight, we propose a\\nset-up involving two atoms accelerating with identical acceleration. We find\\nthat if their Rindler frames (consequently their trajectories) get\\ninfinitesimally separated, the atoms become entangled. Remarkably again, this\\nentanglement, like the perceived thermality, is independent of the shift\\nparameter, provided it is non-vanishing. We investigate the dependence of\\nentanglement on acceleration of the detectors. The present study indicates that\\nthe entanglement between two detectors, moving on the same Rindler wedge, is\\npossible. Moreover, small spacetime fluctuations can lead to entanglement\\nbetween detectors, moving along same classical trajectory. Hence we feel that\\nsuch theoretical prediction has potential to probe the Planck length nature of\\nspacetime.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T06:05:41Z\"}"}
