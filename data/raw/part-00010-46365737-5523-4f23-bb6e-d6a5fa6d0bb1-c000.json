We argue that AI models, especially in autonomous systems, fail to make\\nrobust predictions when faced with unfamiliar or adversarial data, as evidenced\\nby incidents with autonomous vehicles. Traditional machine learning approaches\\nstruggle to address these issues due to an overemphasis on data fitting and\\ndomain adaptation. This position paper posits a paradigm shift towards\\nepistemic artificial intelligence, emphasizing the need for models to learn not\\nonly from what they know but also from their ignorance. This approach, which\\nfocuses on recognizing and managing uncertainty, offers a potential solution to\\nimprove the resilience and robustness of AI systems, ensuring that they can\\nbetter handle unpredictable real-world environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T05:10:38Z\"}"}
