{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16599v1\", \"title\": \"A two-dimensional swarmalator model with higher-order interactions\", \"summary\": \"We study a simple two-dimensional swarmalator model that incorporates\\nhigher-order phase interactions, uncovering a diverse range of collective\\nstates. The latter include spatially coherent and gas-like configurations,\\nneither of which appear in models with only pairwise interactions.\\nAdditionally, we discover bistability between various states, a phenomenon that\\narises directly from the inclusion of higher-order interactions. By analyzing\\nseveral of these emergent states analytically, both for identical and\\nnonidentical populations of swarmalators, we gain deeper insights into their\\nunderlying mechanisms and stability conditions. Our findings broaden the\\nunderstanding of swarmalator dynamics and open new avenues for exploring\\ncomplex collective behaviors in systems governed by higher-order interactions.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.AO\", \"categories\": \"nlin.AO,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T10:28:13Z\"}"}
