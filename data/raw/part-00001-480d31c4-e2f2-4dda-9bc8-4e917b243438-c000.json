Recent cyberattacks have, however, exposed the weaknesses of\\nCAN, which was designed without any security considerations in the 1980s.\\nCurrent efforts to retrofit security via intrusion detection or message\\nauthentication codes are insufficient to fully secure CAN as they cannot\\nadequately protect against masquerading attacks, where a compromised\\ncommunication device, a so-called electronic control units, imitates another\\ndevice. To remedy this situation, multicast source authentication is required\\nto reliably identify the senders of messages. In this paper, we present CAIBA,\\na novel multicast source authentication scheme specifically designed for\\ncommunication buses like CAN. CAIBA relies on an authenticator overwriting\\nauthentication tags on-the-fly, such that a receiver only reads a valid tag if\\nnot only the integrity of a message but also its source can be verified. To\\nintegrate CAIBA into CAN, we devise a special message authentication scheme and\\na reactive bit overwriting mechanism. We achieve interoperability with legacy\\nCAN devices, while protecting receivers implementing the AUTOSAR SecOC standard\\nagainst masquerading attacks without communication overhead or verification\\ndelays.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T13:27:30Z\"}"}
