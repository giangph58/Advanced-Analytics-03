In this work, we\\ninvestigate temporal Fisher information, which measures the temporal\\ninformation content encoded in probability distributions, for both classical\\nand quantum systems. We establish that temporal Fisher information is bounded\\nfrom above by physical costs, such as entropy production in classical Langevin\\nand Markov processes, and the variance of interaction Hamiltonians in open\\nquantum systems. Conversely, temporal Fisher information is bounded from below\\nby statistical distances (e.g., the Bhattacharyya arccos distance), leading to\\nclassical and quantum speed limits that constrain the minimal time required for\\nstate transformations. Our work provides a unified perspective of speed limits\\nfrom the point of view of temporal Fisher information in both classical and\\nquantum dynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T07:34:18Z\"}"}
