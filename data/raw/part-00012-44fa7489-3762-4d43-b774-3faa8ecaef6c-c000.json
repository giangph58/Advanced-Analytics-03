This review examines XR's evolution through\\nfoundational framework - hardware ranging from monitors to sensors and software\\nranging from visual tasks to user interface; highlights state of the art (SOTA)\\nXR products with the comparison and analysis of performance based on their\\nfoundational framework; discusses how commercial XR devices can support the\\ndemand of high-quality performance focusing on spatial intelligence. For future\\ndirections, attention should be given to the integration of multi-modal AI and\\nIoT-driven digital twins to enable adaptive XR systems. With the concept of\\nspatial intelligence, future XR should establish a new digital space with\\nrealistic experience that benefits humanity. This review underscores the\\npivotal role of AI in unlocking XR as the next frontier in human-computer\\ninteraction.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.CV,cs.MA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T15:11:55Z\"}"}
