We use this opportunity to investigate the\\neffectiveness of Charge Comparison Method in Pulse Shape Discrimination of\\nneutron and gamma radiation measured with organic glass scintillator and\\ntrans-stilbene. The idea of software for automated off-line analysis of\\ndigitally recorded data is briefly described. We discuss the difference between\\nLeading Edge and Constant Fraction Discrimination triggering methods and we\\npropose triggering on pulse maximum as an alternative. We observe that the\\nstarting point of charge integration gates has major impact on Figure of Merit\\nvalues, therefore it is important to choose it carefully and report it with\\nother Charge Comparison Method parameters to keep comparison between\\nscintillators reliable. Figure of Merit has a limited usage, so Relative Height\\nof Minimum is proposed as an additional indicator of neutron-gamma\\ndiscrimination effectiveness in practical applications.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T10:53:42Z\"}"}
