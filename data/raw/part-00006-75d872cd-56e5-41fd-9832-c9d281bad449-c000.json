While DNN-based\\nSQA models are not trained for impairment classification, our experiments show\\ngood impairment classification results in an appropriate SQA latent\\nrepresentation. We investigate the clustering of impairments using various\\nkinds of audio degradations that include different types of noises, waveform\\nclipping, gain transition, pitch shift, compression, reverberation, etc. To\\nvisualize the clusters we perform classification of impairments in the\\nSQA-latent representation domain using a standard k-nearest neighbor (kNN)\\nclassifier. We also develop a new DNN-based SQA model, named DNSMOS+, to\\nexamine whether an improvement in SQA leads to an improvement in impairment\\nclassification. The classification accuracy is 94% for LibriAugmented dataset\\nwith 16 types of impairments and 54% for ESC-50 dataset with 50 types of real\\nnoises.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.AS\", \"categories\": \"eess.AS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T11:22:12Z\"}"}
