{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04096v1\", \"title\": \"Direct Bandgap Photoluminescence of GeSn grown on Si(100) substrate by\\n  Molecular Beam Epitaxy Growth\", \"summary\": \"Group IV alloys of GeSn have gained significant attention for electronic and\\noptoelectronic applications on a Si platform due to their compatibility with\\nexisting CMOS technology, tunable band structure, and potential for a direct\\nbandgap at high Sn concentrations. However, synthesizing Sn-rich GeSn\\nstructures remains challenging due to the low solid solubility of Sn in Ge\\n(less than 1%) and the substantial lattice mismatch ( about 14%) between Sn and\\nGe. In this work, we demonstrate the successful growth of high-quality, relaxed\\nGeSn layers with Sn contents of 9.2% and 11.4% on Si(100) substrates via\\nmolecular beam epitaxy (MBE). As far as we know, this is the first report of\\ndirect bandgap photoluminescence observed from MBE-grown GeSn films without\\npost-growth annealing. Structural characterizations including X-ray diffraction\\n(XRD), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), and transmission electron\\nmicroscopy (TEM) confirm uniform Sn incorporation with minimal defect\\nformation. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) reveals smooth surfaces with low\\nroughness. Temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) measurements further\\nconfirm direct bandgap emission, representing a new stage in the development of\\nMBE-grown GeSn.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T03:21:23Z\"}"}
