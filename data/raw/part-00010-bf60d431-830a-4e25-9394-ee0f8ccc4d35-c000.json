Define $\\n\\\\mathrm{cv}(G)=\\\\{\\\\chi(g)\\\\mid \\\\chi \\\\in \\\\mathrm{Irr}(G), g\\\\in G \\\\} $, $\\n\\\\mathrm{cv}(\\\\chi)=\\\\{\\\\chi(g)\\\\mid g\\\\in G \\\\} $ and denote $ \\\\mathrm{dl}(G) $ by\\nthe derived length of $ G $. In the 1990s Berkovich, Chillag and Zhmud\\ndescribed groups $ G $ in which $ |\\\\mathrm{cv}(\\\\chi)|=3 $ for every non-linear\\n$ \\\\chi \\\\in \\\\mathrm{Irr}(G) $ and their results show that $ G $ is solvable.\\nThey also considered groups in which $ |\\\\mathrm{cv}(\\\\chi)|=4 $ for some\\nnon-linear $ \\\\chi \\\\in \\\\mathrm{Irr}(G) $. Continuing with their work, in this\\narticle, we prove that if $ |\\\\mathrm{cv}(\\\\chi)|\\\\leqslant 4 $ for every\\nnon-linear $ \\\\chi \\\\in \\\\mathrm{Irr}(G) $, then $ G $ is solvable. We also\\nconsidered groups $ G $ such that $ |\\\\mathrm{cv}(G)\\\\setminus \\\\mathrm{cd}(G)|=2\\n$. T. Sakurai classified these groups in the case when $ |\\\\mathrm{cd}(G)|=2 $.\\nWe show that $ G $ is solvable and we classify groups $ G $ when $\\n|\\\\mathrm{cd}(G)|\\\\leqslant 4 $ or $ \\\\mathrm{dl}(G)\\\\leqslant 3 $. It is\\ninteresting to note that these groups are such that $\\n|\\\\mathrm{cv}(\\\\chi)|\\\\leqslant 4 $ for all $ \\\\chi \\\\in \\\\mathrm{Irr}(G) $. Lastly,\\nwe consider finite groups $ G $ with $ |\\\\mathrm{cv}(G)\\\\setminus\\n\\\\mathrm{cd}(G)|=3 $. For nilpotent groups, we obtain a characterization which\\nis also connected to the work of Berkovich, Chillag and Zhmud. For\\nnon-nilpotent groups, we obtain the structure of $ G $ when $ \\\\mathrm{dl}(G)=2\\n$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GR\", \"categories\": \"math.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:35:23Z\"}"}
