{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10334v1\", \"title\": \"Flying Hand: End-Effector-Centric Framework for Versatile Aerial\\n  Manipulation Teleoperation and Policy Learning\", \"summary\": \"Aerial manipulation has recently attracted increasing interest from both\\nindustry and academia. Previous approaches have demonstrated success in various\\nspecific tasks. However, their hardware design and control frameworks are often\\ntightly coupled with task specifications, limiting the development of\\ncross-task and cross-platform algorithms. Inspired by the success of robot\\nlearning in tabletop manipulation, we propose a unified aerial manipulation\\nframework with an end-effector-centric interface that decouples high-level\\nplatform-agnostic decision-making from task-agnostic low-level control. Our\\nframework consists of a fully-actuated hexarotor with a 4-DoF robotic arm, an\\nend-effector-centric whole-body model predictive controller, and a high-level\\npolicy. The high-precision end-effector controller enables efficient and\\nintuitive aerial teleoperation for versatile tasks and facilitates the\\ndevelopment of imitation learning policies. Real-world experiments show that\\nthe proposed framework significantly improves end-effector tracking accuracy,\\nand can handle multiple aerial teleoperation and imitation learning tasks,\\nincluding writing, peg-in-hole, pick and place, changing light bulbs, etc. We\\nbelieve the proposed framework provides one way to standardize and unify aerial\\nmanipulation into the general manipulation community and to advance the field.\\nProject website: https://lecar-lab.github.io/flying_hand/.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T15:41:14Z\"}"}
