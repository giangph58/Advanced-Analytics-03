{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00331v1\", \"title\": \"Geodesic Synthetic Control Methods for Random Objects and Functional\\n  Data\", \"summary\": \"We introduce a geodesic synthetic control method for causal inference that\\nextends existing synthetic control methods to scenarios where outcomes are\\nelements in a geodesic metric space rather than scalars. Examples of such\\noutcomes include distributions, compositions, networks, trees and functional\\ndata, among other data types that can be viewed as elements of a geodesic\\nmetric space given a suitable metric. We extend this further to geodesic\\nsynthetic difference-in-differences that builds on the established synthetic\\ndifference-in-differences for Euclidean outcomes. This estimator generalizes\\nboth the geodesic synthetic control method and a previously proposed geodesic\\ndifference-in-differences method and exhibits a double robustness property. The\\nproposed geodesic synthetic control method is illustrated through comprehensive\\nsimulation studies and applications to the employment composition changes\\nfollowing the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, and the impact of abortion\\nliberalization policy on fertility patterns in East Germany. We illustrate the\\nproposed geodesic synthetic difference-in-differences by studying the\\nconsequences of the Soviet Union's collapse on age-at-death distributions for\\nmales and females.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T06:12:35Z\"}"}
