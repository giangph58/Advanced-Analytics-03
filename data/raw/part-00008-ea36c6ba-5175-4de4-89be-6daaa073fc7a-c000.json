{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05120v1\", \"title\": \"Simulating MLB Seasons using Bayesian Inference and Random Walks\", \"summary\": \"As a dedicated follower of sports statistics and with the MLB season\\nbeginning in late March, I set out to predict how many wins each team would\\naccumulate by the end of the 162 game season. The goal was to build a\\nsimulation framework capable of forecasting the remainder of the season,\\nstarting from a 20 game burn-in period to establish initial estimates of team\\nstrength. My approach used a Bayesian inference model incorporating team win\\npercentage, batting average, and pitching ERA to construct a posterior\\ndistribution of win probability for each matchup. For each game, I sampled from\\nthe posterior and simulated the outcome using a Bernoulli trial. Because future\\nmatchup inputs were unobserved, I forecasted batting averages using random\\nwalks and modeled pitching ERA with Kalman filters. After simulating many\\nseasons, the model produced a distribution of win totals for all 30 teams and\\ncan also be used to estimate each team's probability of making the postseason.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T10:44:29Z\"}"}
