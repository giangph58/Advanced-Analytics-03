{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21808v1\", \"title\": \"Stable Trajectory Clustering: An Efficient Split and Merge Algorithm\", \"summary\": \"Clustering algorithms group data points by characteristics to identify\\npatterns. Over the past two decades, researchers have extended these methods to\\nanalyze trajectories of humans, animals, and vehicles, studying their behavior\\nand movement across applications. This paper presents whole-trajectory\\nclustering and sub-trajectory clustering algorithms based on DBSCAN line\\nsegment clustering, which encompasses two key events: split and merge of line\\nsegments. The events are employed by object movement history and the average\\nEuclidean distance between line segments. In this framework, whole-trajectory\\nclustering considers entire entities' trajectories, whereas sub-trajectory\\nclustering employs a sliding window model to identify similar sub-trajectories.\\nMany existing trajectory clustering algorithms respond to temporary anomalies\\nin data by splitting trajectories, which often obscures otherwise consistent\\nclustering patterns and leads to less reliable insights. We introduce the\\nstable trajectory clustering algorithm, which leverages the mean absolute\\ndeviation concept to demonstrate that selective omission of transient\\ndeviations not only preserves the integrity of clusters but also improves their\\nstability and interpretability. We run all proposed algorithms on real\\ntrajectory datasets to illustrate their effectiveness and sensitivity to\\nparameter variations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.CG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:11:36Z\"}"}
