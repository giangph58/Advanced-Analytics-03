By admitting that the matter content that\\ngenerates such geometries satisfies the Maxwell limit condition, we obtain a\\nclass of regular black holes that give rise to new solutions and successfully\\nreproduce particular cases found in earlier studies of (2-1)-dimensional\\nGeneral Relativity. Moreover, we discover the first regular black hole\\nsolutions in (2+1)-dimensional $f(R, T)$ gravity and explore both qualitatively\\nand quantitatively the non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor present\\nin those solutions.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T11:54:44Z\"}"}
