{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11088v1\", \"title\": \"FLSSM: A Federated Learning Storage Security Model with Homomorphic\\n  Encryption\", \"summary\": \"Federated learning based on homomorphic encryption has received widespread\\nattention due to its high security and enhanced protection of user data\\nprivacy. However, the characteristics of encrypted computation lead to three\\nchallenging problems: ``computation-efficiency\\\", ``attack-tracing\\\" and\\n``contribution-assessment\\\". The first refers to the efficiency of encrypted\\ncomputation during model aggregation, the second refers to tracing malicious\\nattacks in an encrypted state, and the third refers to the fairness of\\ncontribution assessment for local models after encryption. This paper proposes\\na federated learning storage security model with homomorphic encryption (FLSSM)\\nto protect federated learning model privacy and address the three issues\\nmentioned above. First, we utilize different nodes to aggregate local models in\\nparallel, thereby improving encrypted models' aggregation efficiency. Second,\\nwe introduce trusted supervise nodes to examine local models when the global\\nmodel is attacked, enabling the tracing of malicious attacks under homomorphic\\nencryption. Finally, we fairly reward local training nodes with encrypted local\\nmodels based on trusted training time. Experiments on multiple real-world\\ndatasets show that our model significantly outperforms baseline models in terms\\nof both efficiency and security metrics.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T11:33:14Z\"}"}
