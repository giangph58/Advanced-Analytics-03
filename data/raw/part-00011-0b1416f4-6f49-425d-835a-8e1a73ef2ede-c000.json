To circumvent\\nthese limitations, there is a growing interest in alternative materials. In\\nparticular, high-refractive-index dielectrics have emerged as promising\\ncandidates, offering negligible ohmic losses, and supporting both electric and\\nmagnetic resonances in the visible and near-infrared range that can unlock\\nnovel effects. Currently, the few available studies on dielectric nanoantennas\\nfocus on ensemble measurements. Here, we exploit the DNA origami technique to\\nstudy the interaction between silicon nanoparticles and organic fluorophores at\\nthe single molecule level, in controlled geometries and at different spectral\\nranges within the visible spectrum. We characterize their distance-dependent\\ninteraction in terms of fluorescence intensity and lifetime, revealing a\\nsignificant modification of the decay rate together with minimal quenching and\\na high fluorescence quantum yield even at short distances from the dielectric\\nnanoparticle. This work demonstrates the advantages of dielectric nanoantennas\\nover their metallic counterparts and paves the way for their applications in\\nsingle-molecule spectroscopy and sensing.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T14:41:37Z\"}"}
