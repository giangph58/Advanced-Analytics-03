The problem involves\\ndetermining all possible postures of a mobile platform connected to a fixed\\nbase by six legs, given the leg lengths and the internal geometries of the\\nplatform and base. The problem is known to have 40 solutions (whether real or\\ncomplex). The proposed algorithm consists of three main steps: (i) a specific\\nsparse matrix of size 293x362 (the elimination template) is constructed from\\nthe coefficients of the polynomial system describing the platform's kinematics;\\n(ii) the PLU decomposition of this matrix is used to construct a pair of 69x69\\nmatrices; (iii) all 40 solutions (including complex ones) are obtained by\\ncomputing the generalized eigenvectors of this matrix pair. The proposed\\nalgorithm is numerically robust, computationally efficient, and straightforward\\nto implement - requiring only standard linear algebra decompositions. MATLAB,\\nJulia, and Python implementations of the algorithm will be made publicly\\navailable.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T16:18:07Z\"}"}
