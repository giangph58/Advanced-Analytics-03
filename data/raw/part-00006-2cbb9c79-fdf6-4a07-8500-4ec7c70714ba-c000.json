{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17385v1\", \"title\": \"Continuous coherent perfect absorption and lasing at an exceptional\\n  point of anti-parity-time symmetric photonic structures\", \"summary\": \"We consider a type of hypothetical compound materials in which its refractive\\nindex in spatial distribution meet $n(-x)=-n^{*}(x)$, belonging to\\nanti-parity-time (APT) symmetric structures. Additionally, we demand balanced\\nreal positive- and negative- permeabilities with $\\\\mu(-x)=-\\\\mu(x)$. By\\nintroducing parametrization into APT symmetric transfer matrix, together with\\nreciprocity theorem, we propose a generic parametric space to display its\\nassociated scattering results including symmetry phase, exceptional point, and\\nsymmetry broken phase. The outcome is irrespective of any system complexity,\\ngeometries, materials, and operating frequency. With the parametric space, we\\nfind that APT symmetric system not only enables coherent perfect absorption or\\nlasing occurred at an exceptional point, but also realize a simultaneous\\ncoherent perfect absorption-lasing. Since APT-symmetric system is constructed\\nby balanced positive and negative index materials, the phase accumulated from\\noptical path length is null, resulting in an assignment of mode order lost. To\\nverify our analysis, several designed heterostructures are demonstrated to\\nsupport our findings.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T09:08:28Z\"}"}
