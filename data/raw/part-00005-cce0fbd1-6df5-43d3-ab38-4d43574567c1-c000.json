{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01685v1\", \"title\": \"Augmenting chemical databases for atomistic machine learning by sampling\\n  conformational space\", \"summary\": \"Machine learning (ML) has become a standard tool for the exploration of\\nchemical space. Much of the performance of such models depends on the chosen\\ndatabase for a given task. Here, this aspect is investigated for \\\"chemical\\ntasks\\\" including the prediction of hybridization, oxidation, substituent\\neffects, and aromaticity, starting from an initial \\\"restricted\\\" database (iRD).\\nChoosing molecules for augmenting this iRD, including increasing numbers of\\nconformations generated at different temperatures, and retraining the models\\ncan improve predictions of the models on the selected \\\"tasks\\\". Addition of a\\nsmall percentage of conformers (1 % ) obtained at 300 K improves the\\nperformance in almost all cases. On the other hand, and in line with previous\\nstudies, redundancy and highly deformed structures in the augmentation set\\ncompromise prediction quality. Energy and bond distributions were evaluated by\\nmeans of Kullback-Leibler ($D_{\\\\rm KL}$) and Jensen-Shannon ($D_{\\\\rm JS}$)\\ndivergence and Wasserstein distance ($W_{1}$). The findings of this work\\nprovide a baseline for the rational augmentation of chemical databases or the\\ncreation of synthetic databases.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph,physics.data-an\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:32:37Z\"}"}
