{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01816v1\", \"title\": \"Random Phase Approximation Correlation Energy using Real-Space Density\\n  Functional Perturbation Theory\", \"summary\": \"We present a real-space method for computing the random phase approximation\\n(RPA) correlation energy within Kohn-Sham density functional theory, leveraging\\nthe low-rank nature of the frequency-dependent density response operator. In\\nparticular, we employ a cubic scaling formalism based on density functional\\nperturbation theory that circumvents the calculation of the response function\\nmatrix, instead relying on the ability to compute its product with a vector\\nthrough the solution of the associated Sternheimer linear systems. We develop a\\nlarge-scale parallel implementation of this formalism using the subspace\\niteration method in conjunction with the spectral quadrature method, while\\nemploying the Kronecker product-based method for the application of the Coulomb\\noperator and the conjugate orthogonal conjugate gradient method for the\\nsolution of the linear systems. We demonstrate convergence with respect to key\\nparameters and verify the method's accuracy by comparing with planewave\\nresults. We show that the framework achieves good strong scaling to many\\nthousands of processors, reducing the time to solution for a lithium hydride\\nsystem with 128 electrons to around 150 seconds on 4608 processors.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.comp-ph,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:21:51Z\"}"}
