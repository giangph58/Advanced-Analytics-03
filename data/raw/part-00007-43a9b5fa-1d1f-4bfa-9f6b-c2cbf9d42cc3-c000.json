Through simulations\\nof the perceptual crossing paradigm, we explore the effect of various internal\\nreward functions in reinforcement learning agents. The drive to understand is\\nimplemented as an active inference type artificial curiosity reward, whereas\\nthe drive to be understood is implemented through intrinsic rewards for\\nimitation, influence/impressionability, and sub-reaction time anticipation of\\nthe other. Results indicate that while artificial curiosity alone does not lead\\nto a preference for social interaction, rewards emphasizing reciprocal\\nunderstanding successfully drive agents to prioritize interaction. We\\ndemonstrate that this intrinsic motivation can facilitate cooperation in tasks\\nwhere only one agent receives extrinsic reward for the behaviour of the other.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T06:15:24Z\"}"}
