The implicit-explicit discontinuous finite element scheme is based on\\na matrix-free approach, meaning that no global sparse matrix is built and only\\nthe action of the linear operators on a vector is actually implemented.\\nFollowing a profiling analysis, we focus on the performance optimization of the\\nnumerical method and describe the impact of different preconditioning and\\nsolving techniques in this framework. Moreover, we show how the use of the\\nlatest version of the \\\\texttt{deal.II} library and of suitable execution flags\\ncan improve the parallel performance.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.DC,cs.NA,cs.PF\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T08:20:10Z\"}"}
