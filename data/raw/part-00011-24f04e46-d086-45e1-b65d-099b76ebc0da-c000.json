We present\\n\\\\textit{Cam-2-Cam}, an interaction concept implemented in three\\nsmartphone-based AR applications with interactions that span both cameras.\\nResults from our qualitative analysis conducted on 30 participants presented\\ntwo major design lessons that explore the interaction space of smartphone AR\\nwhile maintaining critical AR interface attributes like embodiment and\\nimmersion: (1) \\\\textit{Balancing Contextual Relevance and Feedback Quality}\\nserves to outline a delicate balance between implementing familiar interactions\\npeople do in the real world and the quality of multimodal AR responses and (2)\\n\\\\textit{Preventing Disorientation using Simultaneous Capture and Alternating\\nCameras} which details how to prevent disorientation during AR interactions\\nusing the two distinct camera techniques we implemented in the paper.\\nAdditionally, we consider observed user assumptions or natural tendencies to\\ninform future implementations of dual-camera setups for smartphone-based AR. We\\nenvision our design lessons as an initial pioneering step toward expanding the\\ninteraction space of smartphone-based AR, potentially driving broader adoption\\nand overcoming limitations of single-camera AR.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:56:40Z\"}"}
