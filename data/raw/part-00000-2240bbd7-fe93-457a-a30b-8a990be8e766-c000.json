{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15129v1\", \"title\": \"A General Infrastructure and Workflow for Quadrotor Deep Reinforcement\\n  Learning and Reality Deployment\", \"summary\": \"Deploying robot learning methods to a quadrotor in unstructured outdoor\\nenvironments is an exciting task. Quadrotors operating in real-world\\nenvironments by learning-based methods encounter several challenges: a large\\namount of simulator generated data required for training, strict demands for\\nreal-time processing onboard, and the sim-to-real gap caused by dynamic and\\nnoisy conditions. Current works have made a great breakthrough in applying\\nlearning-based methods to end-to-end control of quadrotors, but rarely mention\\nthe infrastructure system training from scratch and deploying to reality, which\\nmakes it difficult to reproduce methods and applications. To bridge this gap,\\nwe propose a platform that enables the seamless transfer of end-to-end deep\\nreinforcement learning (DRL) policies. We integrate the training environment,\\nflight dynamics control, DRL algorithms, the MAVROS middleware stack, and\\nhardware into a comprehensive workflow and architecture that enables\\nquadrotors' policies to be trained from scratch to real-world deployment in\\nseveral minutes. Our platform provides rich types of environments including\\nhovering, dynamic obstacle avoidance, trajectory tracking, balloon hitting, and\\nplanning in unknown environments, as a physical experiment benchmark. Through\\nextensive empirical validation, we demonstrate the efficiency of proposed\\nsim-to-real platform, and robust outdoor flight performance under real-world\\nperturbations.
