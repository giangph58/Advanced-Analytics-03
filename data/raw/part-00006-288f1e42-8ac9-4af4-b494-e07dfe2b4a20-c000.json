The\\nmain results of this article are that a planar (regular) wandering flow has no\\ngeneralized recurrence and has only two topological invariants: the space of\\nits orbits and its prolongational relation (or, equivalently, its smallest\\nstream). As a byproduct, our results show that, even in absence of any type of\\nrecurrence, the stream of a flow contains fundamental information on its\\nbehavior.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS,math.GN\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T04:06:41Z\"}"}
