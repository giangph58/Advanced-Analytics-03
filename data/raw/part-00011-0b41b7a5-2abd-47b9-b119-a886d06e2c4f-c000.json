{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05892v1\", \"title\": \"Matched Topological Subspace Detector\", \"summary\": \"Topological spaces, represented by simplicial complexes, capture richer\\nrelationships than graphs by modeling interactions not only between nodes but\\nalso among higher-order entities, such as edges or triangles. This motivates\\nthe representation of information defined in irregular domains as topological\\nsignals. By leveraging the spectral dualities of Hodge and Dirac theory,\\npractical topological signals often concentrate in specific spectral subspaces\\n(e.g., gradient or curl). For instance, in a foreign currency exchange network,\\nthe exchange flow signals typically satisfy the arbitrage-free condition and\\nhence are curl-free. However, the presence of anomalies can disrupt these\\nconditions, causing the signals to deviate from such subspaces. In this work,\\nwe formulate a hypothesis testing framework to detect whether simplicial\\ncomplex signals lie in specific subspaces in a principled and tractable manner.\\nConcretely, we propose Neyman-Pearson matched topological subspace detectors\\nfor signals defined at a single simplicial level (such as edges) or jointly\\nacross all levels of a simplicial complex. The (energy-based projection)\\nproposed detectors handle missing values, provide closed-form performance\\nanalysis, and effectively capture the unique topological properties of the\\ndata. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed topological detectors on\\nvarious real-world data, including foreign currency exchange networks.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ML\", \"categories\": \"stat.ML,eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T10:38:30Z\"}"}
