Here we note that, in addition to CF\\npotentials with a globally constant FSR, the potentials having constant FSR\\nconfined within a specific spectral region may be sufficient or, in certain\\ncases, preferable for a range of applications. We describe such potentials in\\nsemiclassical approximation and analyze their properties considering\\nrepresentative examples.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:04:04Z\"}"}
