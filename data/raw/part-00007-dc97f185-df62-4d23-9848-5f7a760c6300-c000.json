{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16069v1\", \"title\": \"Increase of $n_s$ in regularized pole inflation & Einstein-Cartan\\n  gravity\", \"summary\": \"We show that the regularization of the second order pole in the pole\\ninflation can induce the increase of $n_s$, which may be important after the\\nlatest data release of cosmic microwave background (CMB) observation by Atacama\\nCosmology Telescope (ACT). Pole inflation is known to provide a unified\\ndescription of attractor models that they can generate a flat plateau for\\ninflation given a general potential. Recent ACT observation suggests that the\\nconstraint on the scalar spectral index $n_s$ at CMB scale may be shifted to a\\nlarger value than the predictions in the Starobinsky model, the Higgs\\ninflation, and the $\\\\alpha$-attractor model, which motivates us to consider the\\nmodification of the pole inflation. We find that if we regularize the second\\norder pole in the kinetic term such that the kinetic term becomes regular for\\nall field range, we can generally increase $n_s$ because the potential in the\\nlarge field regime will be lifted. We have explicitly demonstrated that this\\ntype of regularized pole inflation can naturally arise from the Einstein-Cartan\\nformalism, and the inflationary predictions are consistent with the latest ACT\\ndata without spoiling the success of the $\\\\alpha$-attractor models.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T17:49:04Z\"}"}
