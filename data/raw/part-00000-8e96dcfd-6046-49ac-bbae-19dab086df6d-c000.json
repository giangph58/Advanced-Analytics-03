We\\nemploy a recently-proposed speech enhancement model based on Schr\\\\\\\"odinger\\nbridge, which has been shown to perform well compared to diffusion-based\\napproaches. We analyze the impact of model scaling and different sampling\\nmethods on the ASR performance. Furthermore, we compare the considered model\\nwith predictive and diffusion-based baselines and analyze the speech\\nrecognition performance when using different pre-trained ASR models. The\\nproposed approach significantly reduces the word error rate, reducing it by\\napproximately 40% relative to the unprocessed speech signals and by\\napproximately 8% relative to a similarly sized predictive approach.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.AS\", \"categories\": \"eess.AS\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:40:50Z\"}"}
