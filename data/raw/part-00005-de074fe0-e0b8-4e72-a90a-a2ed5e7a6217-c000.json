The\\nMscale-DeepOnet introduces the multiscale neural network in the branch and\\ntrunk networks of the original DeepOnet, the resulting Mscale-DeepOnet is shown\\nto be able to capture various high-frequency components of the mapping itself\\nand its image. Numerical results demonstrate the substantial improvement of the\\nMscale-DeepOnet for the problem of wave scattering in the high-frequency regime\\nover the normal DeepOnet with a similar number of network parameters.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.NA,math.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T07:19:54Z\"}"}
