To overcome these challenges,\\nwe present a memristor-based hardware-software co-design that processes raw\\nsequencer signals directly in analog memory, effectively combining the\\nseparated basecalling and read mapping steps. Here we demonstrate, for the\\nfirst time, end-to-end memristor-based genomic analysis in a fully integrated\\nmemristor chip. By exploiting intrinsic device noise for locality-sensitive\\nhashing and implementing parallel approximate searches in content-addressable\\nmemory, we experimentally showcase on-site applications including infectious\\ndisease detection and metagenomic classification. Our experimentally-validated\\nanalysis confirms the effectiveness of this approach on real-world tasks,\\nachieving a state-of-the-art 97.15% F1 score in virus raw signal mapping, with\\n51x speed up and 477x energy saving compared to implementation on a\\nstate-of-the-art ASIC. These results demonstrate that memristor-based in-memory\\ncomputing provides a viable solution for integration with portable sequencers,\\nenabling truly real-time on-site genomic analysis for applications ranging from\\npathogen surveillance to microbial community profiling.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.ET\", \"categories\": \"cs.ET,q-bio.QM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T14:22:34Z\"}"}
