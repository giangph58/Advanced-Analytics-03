The\\nresearch explores how varying mesh step sizes within the coil regions\\ninfluences the simulations accuracy and convergence. The results are analyzed\\nalong a line parallel to the central axis at a distance equal to half of the\\nsolenoid's radius.. The findings emphasize the consistency of the numerical\\nresults, the compatibility of the solvers, and offer insights into further\\noptimization strategies for more efficient simulations.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.acc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.acc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T13:20:36Z\"}"}
