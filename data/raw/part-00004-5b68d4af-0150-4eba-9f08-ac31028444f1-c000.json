To verify that the\\nleading constant agrees with Peyre's predicition we also show that a\\ncommutative unipotent group admitting a smooth equivariant compactification\\nsatisfies the Hasse principle for algebraic groups and weak approximation. We\\nstudy in detail the case of $\\\\mathbb{P}^{p-1}$, where $p$ is the characteristic\\nof $F$, viewed as a compactification of appropriate $F$-wound groups to\\nillustrate new phenomena appearing in the function field setting.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT,math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T16:52:53Z\"}"}
