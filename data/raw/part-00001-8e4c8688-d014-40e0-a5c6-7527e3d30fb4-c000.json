{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17391v1\", \"title\": \"Mach-Zehnder atom interferometry with non-interacting trapped Bose\\n  Einstein condensates\", \"summary\": \"The coherent manipulation of a quantum wave is at the core of quantum\\nsensing. For instance, atom interferometers require linear splitting and\\nrecombination processes to map the accumulated phase shift into a measurable\\npopulation signal. Although Bose Einstein condensates (BECs) are the archetype\\nof coherent matter waves, their manipulation between trapped spatial modes has\\nbeen limited by the strong interparticle collisions. Here, we overcome this\\nproblem by using BECs with tunable interaction trapped in an innovative array\\nof double-well potentials and exploiting quantum tunneling to realize linear\\nbeam splitting. We operate several Mach-Zehnder interferometers in parallel,\\ncanceling common-mode potential instabilities by a differential analysis, thus\\ndemonstrating a trapped-atom gradiometer. Furthermore, by applying a spin-echo\\nprotocol, we suppress additional decoherence sources and approach unprecedented\\ncoherence times of one second. Our interferometer will find applications in\\nprecision measurements of forces with a high spatial resolution and in linear\\nmanipulation of quantum entangled states for sensing with sub shot-noise\\nsensitivity.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.quant-gas,physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T09:18:01Z\"}"}
