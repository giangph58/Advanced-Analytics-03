{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20529v1\", \"title\": \"Safe Bottom-Up Flexibility Provision from Distributed Energy Resources\", \"summary\": \"Modern renewables-based power systems need to tap on the flexibility of\\nDistributed Energy Resources (DERs) connected to distribution networks. It is\\nimportant, however, that DER owners/users remain in control of their assets,\\ndecisions, and objectives. At the same time, the dynamic landscape of\\nDER-penetrated distribution networks calls for agile, data-driven flexibility\\nmanagement frameworks. In the face of these developments, the Multi-Agent\\nReinforcement Learning (MARL) paradigm is gaining significant attention, as a\\ndistributed and data-driven decision-making policy. This paper addresses the\\nneed for bottom-up DER management decisions to account for the distribution\\nnetwork's safety-related constraints. While the related literature on safe MARL\\ntypically assumes that network characteristics are available and incorporated\\ninto the policy's safety layer, which implies active DSO engagement, this paper\\nensures that self-organized DER communities are enabled to provide\\ndistribution-network-safe flexibility services without relying on the\\naspirational and problematic requirement of bringing the DSO in the\\ndecision-making loop.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T08:16:15Z\"}"}
