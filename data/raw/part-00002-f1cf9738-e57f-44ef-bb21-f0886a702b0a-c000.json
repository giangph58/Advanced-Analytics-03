This is\\nbased on our observation that the function derived from a few methods can all\\nbe recast into two terms: one corresponds to the scattering phase, and the\\nother is similar to structure constants related to the Green function. We also\\ndiscuss the possible physical realizations. Our method provides a new physical\\npathway towards the solution of the Riemann hypothesis.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:43:43Z\"}"}
