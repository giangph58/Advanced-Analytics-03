Our\\npurpose is to derive the parameters that define the network structure --\\nspecifically, the distribution of clique size and the abundance of inter-clique\\nlinks -- from the observation of selected statistical features along the random\\nwalk. To this end, we apply a Bayesian approach based on recording the times\\nspent by the walker inside successively visited cliques. The procedure is\\nillustrated with some numerical examples of diverse complexity, where the\\nrelevant structural parameters are successfully recovered.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T13:45:34Z\"}"}
