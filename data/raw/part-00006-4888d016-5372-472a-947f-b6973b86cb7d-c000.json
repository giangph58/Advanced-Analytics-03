{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05008v1\", \"title\": \"Adaptive Contextual Embedding for Robust Far-View Borehole Detection\", \"summary\": \"In controlled blasting operations, accurately detecting densely distributed\\ntiny boreholes from far-view imagery is critical for operational safety and\\nefficiency. However, existing detection methods often struggle due to small\\nobject scales, highly dense arrangements, and limited distinctive visual\\nfeatures of boreholes. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive\\ndetection approach that builds upon existing architectures (e.g., YOLO) by\\nexplicitly leveraging consistent embedding representations derived through\\nexponential moving average (EMA)-based statistical updates.\\n  Our method introduces three synergistic components: (1) adaptive augmentation\\nutilizing dynamically updated image statistics to robustly handle illumination\\nand texture variations; (2) embedding stabilization to ensure consistent and\\nreliable feature extraction; and (3) contextual refinement leveraging spatial\\ncontext for improved detection accuracy. The pervasive use of EMA in our method\\nis particularly advantageous given the limited visual complexity and small\\nscale of boreholes, allowing stable and robust representation learning even\\nunder challenging visual conditions. Experiments on a challenging proprietary\\nquarry-site dataset demonstrate substantial improvements over baseline\\nYOLO-based architectures, highlighting our method's effectiveness in realistic\\nand complex industrial scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T07:25:42Z\"}"}
