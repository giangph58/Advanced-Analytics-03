Various groups of authors have provided an exact characterization for\\nthe global nonnegativity of a signomial in this class in terms of circuit\\nsignomials and that characterization provides a tractable nonnegativity test.\\nWe generalize this characterization to the constrained nonnegativity over a\\nconvex set $X$. This provides a tractable $X$-nonnegativity test for the class\\nin terms of relative entropy programming and in terms of the support function\\nof $X$. Our proof methods rely on the convex cone of constrained SAGE\\nsignomials (sums of arithmetic-geometric exponentials) and the duality theory\\nof this cone.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,math.AG,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T15:11:12Z\"}"}
