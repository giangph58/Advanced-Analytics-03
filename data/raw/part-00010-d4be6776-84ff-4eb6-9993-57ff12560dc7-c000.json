{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00555v1\", \"title\": \"On the Mechanistic Interpretability of Neural Networks for Causality in\\n  Bio-statistics\", \"summary\": \"Interpretable insights from predictive models remain critical in\\nbio-statistics, particularly when assessing causality, where classical\\nstatistical and machine learning methods often provide inherent clarity. While\\nNeural Networks (NNs) offer powerful capabilities for modeling complex\\nbiological data, their traditional \\\"black-box\\\" nature presents challenges for\\nvalidation and trust in high-stakes health applications. Recent advances in\\nMechanistic Interpretability (MI) aim to decipher the internal computations\\nlearned by these networks. This work investigates the application of MI\\ntechniques to NNs within the context of causal inference for bio-statistics.\\n  We demonstrate that MI tools can be leveraged to: (1) probe and validate the\\ninternal representations learned by NNs, such as those estimating nuisance\\nfunctions in frameworks like Targeted Minimum Loss-based Estimation (TMLE); (2)\\ndiscover and visualize the distinct computational pathways employed by the\\nnetwork to process different types of inputs, potentially revealing how\\nconfounders and treatments are handled; and (3) provide methodologies for\\ncomparing the learned mechanisms and extracted insights across statistical,\\nmachine learning, and NN models, fostering a deeper understanding of their\\nrespective strengths and weaknesses for causal bio-statistical analysis.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T14:30:34Z\"}"}
