{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04596v1\", \"title\": \"Dynamic Network Flow Optimization for Task Scheduling in PTZ Camera\\n  Surveillance Systems\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents a novel approach for optimizing the scheduling and\\ncontrol of Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) cameras in dynamic surveillance environments.\\nThe proposed method integrates Kalman filters for motion prediction with a\\ndynamic network flow model to enhance real-time video capture efficiency. By\\nassigning Kalman filters to tracked objects, the system predicts future\\nlocations, enabling precise scheduling of camera tasks. This prediction-driven\\napproach is formulated as a network flow optimization, ensuring scalability and\\nadaptability to various surveillance scenarios. To further reduce redundant\\nmonitoring, we also incorporate group-tracking nodes, allowing multiple objects\\nto be captured within a single camera focus when appropriate. In addition, a\\nvalue-based system is introduced to prioritize camera actions, focusing on the\\ntimely capture of critical events. By adjusting the decay rates of these values\\nover time, the system ensures prompt responses to tasks with imminent\\ndeadlines. Extensive simulations demonstrate that this approach improves\\ncoverage, reduces average wait times, and minimizes missed events compared to\\ntraditional master-slave camera systems. Overall, our method significantly\\nenhances the efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness of surveillance\\nsystems, particularly in dynamic and crowded environments.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.CV,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T17:37:53Z\"}"}
