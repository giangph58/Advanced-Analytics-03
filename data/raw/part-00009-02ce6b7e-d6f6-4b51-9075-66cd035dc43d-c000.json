{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19540v1\", \"title\": \"Event-triggered Robust Model Predictive Control under Hard Computation\\n  Resource Constraints\", \"summary\": \"Model predictive control (MPC) is capable of controlling nonlinear systems\\nwith guaranteed constraint satisfaction and stability. However, MPC requires\\nsolving optimization problems online periodically, which often exceeds the\\nlocal system's computational capabilities. A potential solution is to leverage\\nexternal processing, such as a central industrial server. Yet, this central\\ncomputer typically serves multiple systems simultaneously, leading to\\nsignificant hardware demands due to the need to solve numerous optimization\\nproblems concurrently. In this work, we tackle this challenge by developing an\\nevent-triggered model predictive control (ET-MPC) that provably stabilizes\\nmultiple nonlinear systems under disturbances while solving only optimization\\nproblems for a fixed-size subset at any given time. Unlike existing ET-MPC\\nmethods, which primarily reduce average computational load yet still require\\nhardware capable of handling all systems simultaneously, our approach reduces\\nthe worst-case computational load. This significantly lowers central server\\nhardware requirements by diminishing peak computational demands. We achieve our\\nimprovements by leveraging recent advancements in distributed event-triggered\\nlinear control and integrating them with a robust MPC that employs constraint\\ntightening.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T07:44:35Z\"}"}
