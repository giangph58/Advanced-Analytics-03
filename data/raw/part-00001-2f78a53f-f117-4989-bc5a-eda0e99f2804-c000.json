{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01743v1\", \"title\": \"High Dimensional Bayesian Optimization using Lasso Variable Selection\", \"summary\": \"Bayesian optimization (BO) is a leading method for optimizing expensive\\nblack-box optimization and has been successfully applied across various\\nscenarios. However, BO suffers from the curse of dimensionality, making it\\nchallenging to scale to high-dimensional problems. Existing work has adopted a\\nvariable selection strategy to select and optimize only a subset of variables\\niteratively. Although this approach can mitigate the high-dimensional challenge\\nin BO, it still leads to sample inefficiency. To address this issue, we\\nintroduce a novel method that identifies important variables by estimating the\\nlength scales of Gaussian process kernels. Next, we construct an effective\\nsearch region consisting of multiple subspaces and optimize the acquisition\\nfunction within this region, focusing on only the important variables. We\\ndemonstrate that our proposed method achieves cumulative regret with a\\nsublinear growth rate in the worst case while maintaining computational\\nefficiency. Experiments on high-dimensional synthetic functions and real-world\\nproblems show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T13:54:04Z\"}"}
