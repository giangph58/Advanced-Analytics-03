This study employs large-scale molecular dynamics\\nsimulations combined with machine learning-assisted analysis to elucidate how\\npolymer type (hydrophilic vs hydrophobic) modulates interfacial premelting. Our\\nsimulations reveal that hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer surfaces have\\ndistinct effects on the QLL thickness, interfacial water structure, and\\ndiffusivity. Specifically, a hydrophilic polymer interface promotes a thicker\\nQLL with more ordered interfacial water and lower diffusivity, whereas a\\nhydrophobic interface induces a thinner QLL with a less ordered interfacial\\nwater structure and higher diffusivity. These results advance the understanding\\nof polymer-mediated interfacial melting phenomena and offer guidance for\\ndesigning anti-icing and low-friction materials.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T09:39:44Z\"}"}
