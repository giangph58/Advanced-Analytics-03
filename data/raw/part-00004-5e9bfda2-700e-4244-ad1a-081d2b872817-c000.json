{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12230v1\", \"title\": \"Suppression of composition g-modes in chemically-equilibrating warm\\n  neutron stars\", \"summary\": \"We investigate the impact of chemical equilibration and the resulting bulk\\nviscosity on non-radial oscillation modes of warm neutron stars at temperatures\\nup to T~5 MeV, relevant for protoneutron stars and neutron-star post-merger\\nremnants. In this regime, the relaxation rate of weak interactions becomes\\ncomparable to the characteristic frequencies of composition g-modes in the\\ncore, resulting in resonant damping. To capture this effect, we introduce the\\ndynamic sound speed, a complex, frequency-dependent generalization of the\\nadiabatic sound speed that encodes both the restoring force and the dissipative\\neffects of bulk compression. Using realistic weak reaction rates and three\\nrepresentative equations of state, we compute the complex frequencies of\\ncomposition g-modes with finite-temperature profiles. We find that bulk viscous\\ndamping becomes increasingly significant with temperature and can completely\\nsuppress composition g-modes. In contrast, the f-mode remains largely\\nunaffected by bulk viscosity due to its nearly divergence-free character. Our\\nresults highlight the sensitivity of g-mode behavior to thermal structure, weak\\nreaction rates, and the equation of state, and establish the dynamic sound\\nspeed as a valuable descriptor characterizing oscillation properties in\\ndissipative neutron star matter.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,gr-qc,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T16:27:50Z\"}"}
