The proposed strategy is applicable to\\nuncertain linear time-invariant systems subject to sub-Gaussian disturbances.\\nAs the main result, the proposed approach provides a priori guarantees,\\nensuring that the optimized exploration inputs achieve a desired accuracy of\\nthe model parameters. The technical derivation of the strategy (i) leverages\\nexisting non-asymptotic identification bounds with self-normalized martingales,\\n(ii) utilizes spectral lines to predict the effect of sinusoidal excitation,\\nand (iii) effectively accounts for spectral transient error and parametric\\nuncertainty. A numerical example illustrates how the finite exploration time\\ninfluence the required exploration energy.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T08:17:17Z\"}"}
