Although the\\nidentification of these qualities in software requirements described in natural\\nlanguage has been investigated, most of the results are often not applicable in\\npractice, and rely on having been validated on small datasets and limited\\namount of projects. For many years, machine learning (ML) techniques have been\\nproved as a valid technique to identify and tag terms described in natural\\nlanguage. In order to advance previous works, in this research we use cutting\\nedge models like Transformers, together with a vast dataset mined and curated\\nfrom GitHub, to identify what text is usually associated with different quality\\nproperties. We also study the distribution of such qualities in issue trackers\\nfrom openly accessible software repositories, and we evaluate our approach both\\nwith students from a software engineering course and with its application to\\nrecognize security labels in industry.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T10:40:40Z\"}"}
