{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05283v1\", \"title\": \"JWST Reveals Spectral Tracers of Recent Surface Modification on Europa\", \"summary\": \"Europa has been modified by a variety of geologic processes, exposing\\ninternally-derived materials that are heavily irradiated by charged particles\\ntrapped in Jupiter's magnetosphere. Prior spectral analysis of H2O ice on\\nEuropa relied on low signal-to-noise data at wavelengths >2.5 microns, limiting\\nassessment of a 3.1 micron Fresnel peak that is diagnostic of exposed\\ncrystalline ice. We report new measurements of H2O ice spectral features using\\nhigh signal-to-noise data collected by the NIRSpec spectrograph (1.48 - 5.35\\nmicrons) on the James Webb Space Telescope. These data reveal a narrow 3.1\\nmicron crystalline H2O ice Fresnel peak, which is primarily located at southern\\nlatitudes in Tara and Powys Regiones. Our analysis indicates that crystalline\\nice exposed in these low-latitude regiones is likely sustained by ongoing\\nthermal (re)crystallization outpacing charged particle amorphization of the top\\n10 microns of Europa's regolith over short timescales (<15 days). We also\\nmeasured H2O ice features centered near 1.5 microns, 1.65 microns, and 2.0\\nmicrons, and a broad 3.6 micron H2O continuum peak, which are all stronger at\\nnorthern latitudes, in contrast to the 3.1 micron Fresnel peak identified at\\nsouthern latitudes. These results support the hypothesis that H2O ice in\\nEuropa's regolith is vertically stratified, with amorphous ice grains\\ndominating its exposed surface, except in Tara and Powys Regiones. We also find\\nthat a previously detected 4.38 micron 13O2 feature is present almost\\nexclusively at southern latitudes in Tara and Powys Regiones, likely derived\\nfrom an internal source of carbon-bearing material.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T17:32:42Z\"}"}
