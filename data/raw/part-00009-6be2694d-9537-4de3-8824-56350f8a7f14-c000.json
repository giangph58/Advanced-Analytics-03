{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21840v1\", \"title\": \"Parameter Inference of Black Hole Images using Deep Learning in\\n  Visibility Space\", \"summary\": \"Using very long baseline interferometry, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)\\ncollaboration has resolved the shadows of two supermassive black holes. Model\\ncomparison is traditionally performed in image space, where imaging algorithms\\nintroduce uncertainties in the recovered structure. Here, we develop a deep\\nlearning framework to perform parameter inference in visibility space, directly\\nusing the data measured by the interferometer without introducing potential\\nerrors and biases from image reconstruction. First, we train and validate our\\nframework on synthetic data derived from general relativistic\\nmagnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations that vary in magnetic field state,\\nspin, and $R_\\\\mathrm{high}$. Applying these models to the real data obtained\\nduring the 2017 EHT campaign, and only considering total intensity, we do not\\nderive meaningful constraints on either of these parameters. At present, our\\nmethod is limited both by theoretical uncertainties in the GRMHD simulations\\nand variation between snapshots of the same underlying physical model. However,\\nwe demonstrate that spin and $R_\\\\mathrm{high}$ could be recovered using this\\nframework through continuous monitoring of our sources, which mitigates\\nvariations due to turbulence. In future work, we anticipate that including\\nspectral or polarimetric information will greatly improve the performance of\\nthis framework.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:50:47Z\"}"}
