We construct the perverse homotopy t-structure which is the best\\npossible approximation to a perverse t-structure on Artin motives with rational\\ncoefficients. The heart of this t-structure has properties similar to those of\\nthe category of perverse sheaves and contains the Ayoub-Zucker motive. With\\nintegral coefficients, we construct the perverse motivic t-structure on Artin\\nmotives when the base scheme is of dimension at most $2$ and show that it\\ncannot exist in dimension $4$. This construction relies notably on a an\\nanalogue for Artin motives of the Artin Vanishing Theorem.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T09:25:27Z\"}"}
