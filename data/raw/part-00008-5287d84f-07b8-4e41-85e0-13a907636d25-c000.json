{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19624v1\", \"title\": \"ARMOR: Adaptive Meshing with Reinforcement Optimization for Real-time 3D\\n  Monitoring in Unexposed Scenes\", \"summary\": \"Unexposed environments, such as lava tubes, mines, and tunnels, are among the\\nmost complex yet strategically significant domains for scientific exploration\\nand infrastructure development. Accurate and real-time 3D meshing of these\\nenvironments is essential for applications including automated structural\\nassessment, robotic-assisted inspection, and safety monitoring. Implicit neural\\nSigned Distance Fields (SDFs) have shown promising capabilities in online\\nmeshing; however, existing methods often suffer from large projection errors\\nand rely on fixed reconstruction parameters, limiting their adaptability to\\ncomplex and unstructured underground environments such as tunnels, caves, and\\nlava tubes. To address these challenges, this paper proposes ARMOR, a\\nscene-adaptive and reinforcement learning-based framework for real-time 3D\\nmeshing in unexposed environments. The proposed method was validated across\\nmore than 3,000 meters of underground environments, including engineered\\ntunnels, natural caves, and lava tubes. Experimental results demonstrate that\\nARMOR achieves superior performance in real-time mesh reconstruction, reducing\\ngeometric error by 3.96\\\\% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while\\nmaintaining real-time efficiency. The method exhibits improved robustness,\\naccuracy, and adaptability, indicating its potential for advanced 3D monitoring\\nand mapping in challenging unexposed scenarios.
