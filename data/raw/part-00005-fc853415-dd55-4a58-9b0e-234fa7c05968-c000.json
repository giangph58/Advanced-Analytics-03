{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15183v1\", \"title\": \"Multiple Quantum Many-Body Clustering Probed by Dynamical Decoupling\", \"summary\": \"The manipulation of quantum information in large systems requires precise\\ncontrol of quantum systems that are out-of-equilibrium. As the size of the\\nsystem increases, its fragility in response to external perturbations and\\nintrinsic decoherence processes also increases. The degradation of the system\\nresponse makes accurate measurements a challenging and time-consuming task.\\nHowever, quantum information lifetime enhancement can be achieved by dynamical\\ndecoupling techniques (DD), where an external drive with a frequency much\\nhigher than the system's internal evolution renders signal acquisition with\\ndecay times greater than 1000-fold. In this study, we demonstrate that the\\nsystem response during a prethermal period, subject to Floquet control, can be\\nutilized to probe the multiple quantum evolution of dense and highly connected\\nspin systems. This approach exhibits an enhanced sensitivity at a reduced\\nexperimental time. The enhanced signal-to-noise ratio achieved enabled the use\\nof numerical inversion strategies to model the evolution of the excited\\nmultiple quantum coherences, which describe the number of correlated spins\\nwithin a cluster. We observed for the first time, to the best of our knowledge,\\nthat the increase in the number of correlated spins with multiple quantum\\nevolution is accompanied by an increase in the distribution of spin cluster\\nsizes, which follows a quadratic law.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T15:46:05Z\"}"}
