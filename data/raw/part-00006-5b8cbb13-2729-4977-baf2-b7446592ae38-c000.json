Nodal lines of an Ising SOC in the Brillouin zone are imposed\\nby symmetry, so they cause such nodal points whenever they intersect an FS\\npocket, which is indeed the case in monolayer NbSe$_2$ and TaS$_2$, but not in\\ngated MoS$_2$ and WS$_2$. Our analysis reinterprets existing measurements,\\nconcluding that a dominant singlet-order parameter on pockets with SOC nodes is\\nconsistent with the $H_c(T)$ data for all monolayer Ising superconductors, in\\ncontrast to previous contradictory pairing assumptions. Finally, we show that\\nthe theory is also consistent with data on homobilayer TMDs.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:53:27Z\"}"}
