{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05194v1\", \"title\": \"Two-dimensional $J_1$-$J_2$ clock model: A cornucopia of emergence\", \"summary\": \"We present a comprehensive study on the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ classical\\n$q$-state clock model with even $q>4$ on a two-dimensional square lattice,\\nrevealing a rich ensemble of phases driven by competing interactions. In the\\nunfrustrated regime ($J_1>2J_2$), the model reproduces the standard clock model\\nphenomenology: a low-temperature $\\\\mathbb{Z}_q$-broken ferromagnet, an\\nintermediate XY-like critical quasi-long-range-ordered (QLRO) phase with\\nemergent $U(1)$ symmetry, and a high-temperature paramagnet. For $J_1<2J_2$,\\nfrustration stabilizes five distinct regimes: the disordered paramagnet, a\\nstripe-ordered phase breaking $\\\\mathbb{Z}_q\\\\times\\\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, two\\n$\\\\mathbb{Z}_2$-broken nematic phases (one with and one without QLRO), and an\\nexotic stripe phase with emergent discrete $\\\\mathbb{Z}_q$ spin degrees of\\nfreedom prohibited in the microscopic Hamiltonian. Remarkably, this seemingly\\nforbidden $\\\\mathbb{Z}_q$ order emerges via a relevant operator in the infrared\\nlong-wavelength limit, rather than from an irrelevant perturbation,\\nhighlighting a non-standard route to emergence. Using large-scale corner\\ntransfer matrix renormalization group calculations, complemented by classical\\nMonte Carlo simulations, we map the complete phase diagram and identify\\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless, Ising, first-order, and unconventional\\nLandau-incompatible transitions between different phases. Finally, we propose\\nan effective field-theoretic framework that encompasses these emergent orders\\nand their interwoven transitions.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T12:51:59Z\"}"}
