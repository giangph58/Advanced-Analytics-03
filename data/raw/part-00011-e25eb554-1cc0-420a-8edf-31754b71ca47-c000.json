{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15925v1\", \"title\": \"Improving robustness and training efficiency of machine-learned\\n  potentials by incorporating short-range empirical potentials\", \"summary\": \"Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) are powerful tools for materials\\nmodeling, but their performance is often limited by training dataset quality,\\nparticularly the lack of rare event configurations. This limitation undermines\\ntheir accuracy and robustness in long-time and large-scale molecular dynamics\\nsimulations. In this work, we present a hybrid MLFF framework that integrates\\nan empirical short-range repulsive potential and demonstrates improved\\nrobustness and training efficiency. Using solid electrolyte\\nLi$_7$La$_3$Zr$_2$O$_{12}$ (LLZO) as a model system, we show that purely\\ndata-driven MLFFs fail to prevent unphysical atomistic clustering in extended\\nsimulations due to inadequate short-range repulsion. In contrast, the hybrid\\nforce field eliminates these artifacts, enabling stable long-time simulations,\\nwhich are critical for studying various properties of LLZO. The hybrid\\nframework also reduces the need for extensive active learning and performs well\\nwith just 25 training configurations. By combining physics-driven constraints\\nwith data-driven flexibility, this approach is compatible with most existing\\nMLFF architectures and establishes a universal paradigm for developing robust,\\ntraining-efficient force fields for complex material systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T14:12:45Z\"}"}
