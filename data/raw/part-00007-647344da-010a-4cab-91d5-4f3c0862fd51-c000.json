In such\\ncases, the light must be depolarized to allow properly calibrated measurements.\\nSeveral types of depolarizers are already in use, but none is optimal due to\\nthe inevitable image degradation associated with the scrambling process. Here,\\nwe present a device based on an all-dielectric metasurface using anisotropic\\nscatterers capable of generating multiple polarization states by varying their\\norientation angle. Our new scrambling solution allows a massive reduction in\\nthe integrated degree of polarization and thus the spatial depolarization of\\nany incident linear polarization, while allowing easier integration into the\\ninstrument design and reducing the impact on its image quality.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:11:40Z\"}"}
