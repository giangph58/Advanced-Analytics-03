The model incorporates key socioeconomic and\\nenvironmental variables and is applicable at macro-, meso-, and\\nmicro-demographic levels, addressing global fertility declines, regional\\npopulation disparities, and micro-level phenomena such as teenage pregnancies.\\nThis approach enables a comprehensive analysis of reproductive health at\\naggregate, sub-national, and age-group-specific levels. An agent-based model\\nfor teenage pregnancy is described to illustrate how latent factors -- such as\\neducation, contraceptive use, and parental guidance -- interact with\\ncatastrophic shocks like socioeconomic deprivation, violence, and substance\\nabuse. The bifurcation set analysis shows how minor shifts in socioeconomic\\nconditions can lead to significant changes in fertility rates, revealing\\ncritical points in fertility transitions. By integrating Thom's morphogenesis\\nequations with traditional fertility theory, this paper proposes a\\ngroundbreaking approach to understanding fertility dynamics, offering valuable\\ninsights for the development of public health policies that address both stable\\nfertility patterns and abrupt demographic shifts.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph,math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T08:09:38Z\"}"}
