In\\nparticular, this implies that there exist infinitely many non-isotopic contact\\nstructures on the real projective 3-space which cannot be obtained by a single\\nrational contact surgery from the standard tight contact 3-sphere.\\n  Large parts of our proofs deal with a detailed analysis of Gompf's\\n$\\\\Gamma$-invariant of tangential 2-plane fields on 3-manifolds. From our main\\nresult we also deduce that the $\\\\Gamma$-invariant of a tangential 2-plane field\\non the real projective 3-space only depends on its $d_3$-invariant.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GT\", \"categories\": \"math.GT,math.SG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:54:55Z\"}"}
