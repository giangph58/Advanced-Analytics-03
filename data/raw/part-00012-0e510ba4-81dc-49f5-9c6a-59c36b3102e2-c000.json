{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03237v1\", \"title\": \"Well-balanced POD-based reduced-order models for finite volume\\n  approximation of hyperbolic balance laws\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces a reduced-order modeling approach based on finite\\nvolume methods for hyperbolic systems, combining Proper Orthogonal\\nDecomposition (POD) with the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM) and\\nProper Interval Decomposition (PID). Applied to systems such as the transport\\nequation with source term, non-homogeneous Burgers equation, and shallow water\\nequations with non-flat bathymetry and Manning friction, this method achieves\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency and accuracy compared to\\nprevious time-averaging techniques. A theoretical result justifying the use of\\nwell-balanced Full-Order Models (FOMs) is presented. Numerical experiments\\nvalidate the approach, demonstrating its accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore,\\nthe question of prediction of solutions for systems that depend on some\\nphysical parameters is also addressed, and a sensitivity analysis on POD\\nparameters confirms the model's robustness and efficiency in this case.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T07:05:56Z\"}"}
