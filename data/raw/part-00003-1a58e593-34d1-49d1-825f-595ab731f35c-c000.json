In this study, we explore how convective mixing can\\nlink the planetary primordial state to its atmospheric composition. We simulate\\nthe long-term evolution of gas giants with masses between 0.3 and 3 Jupiter\\nmasses, considering various composition profiles and primordial entropies\\n(assuming no entropy-mass dependence). Our results show that when convective\\nmixing is considered, the atmospheric metallicity increases with time and that\\nthis time evolution encodes information about the planetary primordial\\nstructure. Additionally, the degree of compositional mixing affects the\\nplanetary radius, altering its evolution in a measurable way. By applying mock\\nobservations, we demonstrate that combining radius and atmospheric composition\\ncan help to constrain the planetary formation history. Young systems emerge as\\nprime targets for such characterization, with lower-mass gas giants\\n(approaching Saturn's mass) being particularly susceptible to mixing-induced\\nchanges. Our findings highlight convective mixing as a key mechanism for\\nprobing the primordial state of giant planets, offering new constraints on\\nformation models and demonstrating that the conditions inside giant planets\\nshortly after their formation are not necessarily erased over billions of years\\nand can leave a lasting imprint on their evolution.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T14:32:56Z\"}"}
