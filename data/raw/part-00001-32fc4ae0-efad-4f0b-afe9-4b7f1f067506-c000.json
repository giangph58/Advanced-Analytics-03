{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19497v1\", \"title\": \"Negative Imaginary Neural ODEs: Learning to Control Mechanical Systems\\n  with Stability Guarantees\", \"summary\": \"We propose a neural control method to provide guaranteed stabilization for\\nmechanical systems using a novel negative imaginary neural ordinary\\ndifferential equation (NINODE) controller. Specifically, we employ neural\\nnetworks with desired properties as state-space function matrices within a\\nHamiltonian framework to ensure the system possesses the NI property. This\\nNINODE system can serve as a controller that asymptotically stabilizes an NI\\nplant under certain conditions. For mechanical plants with colocated force\\nactuators and position sensors, we demonstrate that all the conditions required\\nfor stability can be translated into regularity constraints on the neural\\nnetworks used in the controller. We illustrate the utility, effectiveness, and\\nstability guarantees of the NINODE controller through an example involving a\\nnonlinear mass-spring system.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.LG,cs.SY,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T05:37:25Z\"}"}
