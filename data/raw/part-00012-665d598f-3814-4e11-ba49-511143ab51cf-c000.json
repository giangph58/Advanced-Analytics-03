To learn the Gibbs state of local Hamiltonians at any inverse\\ntemperature $\\\\beta$, the state-of-the-art provable algorithms fall short of the\\noptimal sample and computational complexity, in sharp contrast with the\\nlocality and simplicity in the classical cases. In this work, we present a\\nlearning algorithm that learns each local term of a $n$-qubit $D$-dimensional\\nHamiltonian to an additive error $\\\\epsilon$ with sample complexity\\n$\\\\tilde{O}\\\\left(\\\\frac{e^{\\\\mathrm{poly}(\\\\beta)}}{\\\\beta^2\\\\epsilon^2}\\\\right)\\\\log(n)$.\\nThe protocol uses parallelizable local quantum measurements that act within\\nbounded regions of the lattice and near-linear-time classical post-processing.\\nThus, our complexity is near optimal with respect to $n,\\\\epsilon$ and is\\npolynomially tight with respect to $\\\\beta$. We also give a learning algorithm\\nfor Hamiltonians with bounded interaction degree with sample and time\\ncomplexities of similar scaling on $n$ but worse on $\\\\beta, \\\\epsilon$. At the\\nheart of our algorithm is the interplay between locality, the\\nKubo-Martin-Schwinger condition, and the operator Fourier transform at\\narbitrary temperatures.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:42:23Z\"}"}
