Our approach applies to a new class of correlated\\nnoncentrosymmetric materials that host two spin-split Fermi surfaces with\\nidentical spin textures due to a spin-orbital intertwined effect. Incorporating\\nmulti-orbital repulsive Hubbard interactions, we calculate the superconducting\\npairings of a minimal two-orbital effective model within a\\nspin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity framework. We find that, depending\\non the effective Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) strength and filling level,\\nthe Hubbard interaction can drive the leading pairing symmetry into the\\n$A_1(S_{\\\\pm})$, $B_1$, $B_2$ or $B_2(d_{\\\\pm})$ irreducible representations\\n(IRs) of the $C_{4v}$ point group. Notably, the $A_1(S_{\\\\pm})$ pairing gives\\nrise to a fully gapped TSC characterized by a $Z_2$ invariant, while the\\n$B_2(d_{\\\\pm})$ pairing results in a nodal TSC. Our analysis reveals that the\\nfully gapped TSC is predominated by spin-singlet regardless of the presence of\\nthe spin-triplet components. This distinguishes our model from\\nnoncentrosymmetric materials with conventional Rashba-split band structures,\\nwhere TSC typically emerges near the van Hove singularity and is primarily\\ndriven by $p$-wave or $f$-wave spin-triplet pairing. These features enhances\\nits experimental accessibility, and we discuss potential experimental systems\\nfor its realization.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:40:34Z\"}"}
