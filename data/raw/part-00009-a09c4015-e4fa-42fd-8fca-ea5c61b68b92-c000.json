To enhance SOC without synthesizing new materials,\\nwe leverage interfacial interactions between molecules and\\ntransition-element-based solid-state materials. This computational study\\ninvestigates SOC splitting in metal-phthalocyanine adsorbed on transition metal\\ndichalcogenides (TMDs) using density functional theory (DFT). The enhanced SOC\\nsplitting is attributed to strong orbital hybridization at the\\nmolecule-substrate interface. Specifically, Zn-phthalocyanine (ZnPC) on\\nmonolayer MoS2 achieves a notable SOC splitting of ~8 meV. Furthermore, when\\nZnPC forms self-assembled chains on MoS2, the splitting increases to ~20 meV,\\ndriven by the formation of hybrid bands modulated by molecular periodicity.\\nThese findings highlight the role of interfacial and intermolecular\\ninteractions in inducing and enhancing SOC in surface-adsorbed molecules,\\nproviding a new strategy for molecular spintronic materials without complex\\nsynthetic efforts.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.chem-ph,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T05:11:19Z\"}"}
