{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19726v1\", \"title\": \"Discrimination performance in illness-death models with\\n  interval-censored disease data\", \"summary\": \"In clinical studies, the illness-death model is often used to describe\\ndisease progression. A subject starts disease-free, may develop the disease and\\nthen die, or die directly. In clinical practice, disease can only be diagnosed\\nat pre-specified follow-up visits, so the exact time of disease onset is often\\nunknown, resulting in interval-censored data. This study examines the impact of\\nignoring this interval-censored nature of disease data on the discrimination\\nperformance of illness-death models, focusing on the time-specific Area Under\\nthe receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) in both incident/dynamic and\\ncumulative/dynamic definitions. A simulation study with data simulated from\\nWeibull transition hazards and disease state censored at regular intervals is\\nconducted. Estimates are derived using different methods: the Cox model with a\\ntime-dependent binary disease marker, which ignores interval-censoring, and the\\nillness-death model for interval-censored data estimated with three\\nimplementations - the piecewise-constant model from the msm package, the\\nWeibull and M-spline models from the SmoothHazard package. These methods are\\nalso applied to a dataset of 2232 patients with high-grade soft tissue sarcoma,\\nwhere the interval-censored disease state is the post-operative development of\\ndistant metastases. The results suggest that, in the presence of\\ninterval-censored disease times, it is important to account for\\ninterval-censoring not only when estimating the parameters of the model but\\nalso when evaluating the discrimination performance of the disease.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T12:26:13Z\"}"}
