However, identifying such microlensed GRBs within large datasets is a\\nsignificant challenge. In this study, we develop a machine learning approach to\\ndistinguish Lensed GRBs from their Non-lensed counterparts using simulated\\nlight curves. A comprehensive dataset was generated, comprising labeled light\\ncurves for both categories. Features were extracted using the Cesium package,\\ncapturing critical temporal properties of the light curves. Multiple machine\\nlearning models were trained on the extracted features, with Random Forest\\nachieving the best performance, delivering an accuracy of 94\\\\% and an F1 score\\nof 95\\\\% (94\\\\%) for Non-Lensed (Lensed) class. This approach successfully\\ndemonstrates the potential of machine learning for identifying gravitational\\nlensing in GRBs, paving the way for future observational applications.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:31:43Z\"}"}
