{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23867v1\", \"title\": \"Experimental Measurement of Non-Hermitian Left Eigenvectors\", \"summary\": \"The duality of left and right eigenvectors underpins the comprehensive\\nunderstanding of many physical phenomena. In Hermitian systems, left and right\\neigenvectors are simply Hermitian-conjugate pairs. Non-Hermitian eigenstates in\\ncontrast, have left and right eigenvectors that are distinct from each other.\\nHowever, despite the tremendous interest in non-Hermitian physics in recent\\nyears, the roles of non-Hermitian left eigenvectors (LEVs) are still\\ninadequately explored-their physical consequences and observable effects remain\\nelusive, so much so that LEVs seem largely like an object of primarily\\nmathematical purpose. In this study, we present a method based on the\\nnon-Hermitian Green's function for directly retrieving both LEVs and REVs from\\nexperimentally measured steady-state responses. We validate the effectiveness\\nof this approach in two separate acoustic experiments: one characterizes the\\nnon-Hermitian Berry phase, and the other measures extended topological modes.\\nOur results not only unambiguously demonstrate observable effects related to\\nnon-Hermitian LEVs, but also highlight the under-appreciated role of LEVs in\\nnon-Hermitian phenomena.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.class-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T09:17:30Z\"}"}
