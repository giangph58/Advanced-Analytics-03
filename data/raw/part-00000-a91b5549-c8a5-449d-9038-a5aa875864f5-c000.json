{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23697v1\", \"title\": \"A Low-complexity Structured Neural Network to Realize States of\\n  Dynamical Systems\", \"summary\": \"Data-driven learning is rapidly evolving and places a new perspective on\\nrealizing state-space dynamical systems. However, dynamical systems derived\\nfrom nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) suffer from limitations\\nin computational efficiency. Thus, this paper stems from data-driven learning\\nto advance states of dynamical systems utilizing a structured neural network\\n(StNN). The proposed learning technique also seeks to identify an optimal,\\nlow-complexity operator to solve dynamical systems, the so-called Hankel\\noperator, derived from time-delay measurements. Thus, we utilize the StNN based\\non the Hankel operator to solve dynamical systems as an alternative to existing\\ndata-driven techniques. We show that the proposed StNN reduces the number of\\nparameters and computational complexity compared with the conventional neural\\nnetworks and also with the classical data-driven techniques, such as Sparse\\nIdentification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) and Hankel Alternative view of\\nKoopman (HAVOK), which is commonly known as delay-Dynamic Mode\\nDecomposition(DMD) or Hankel-DMD. More specifically, we present numerical\\nsimulations to solve dynamical systems utilizing the StNN based on the Hankel\\noperator beginning from the fundamental Lotka-Volterra model, where we compare\\nthe StNN with the LEarning Across Dynamical Systems (LEADS), and extend our\\nanalysis to highly nonlinear and chaotic Lorenz systems, comparing the StNN\\nwith conventional neural networks, SINDy, and HAVOK. Hence, we show that the\\nproposed StNN paves the way for realizing state-space dynamical systems with a\\nlow-complexity learning algorithm, enabling prediction and understanding of\\nfuture states.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T03:52:38Z\"}"}
