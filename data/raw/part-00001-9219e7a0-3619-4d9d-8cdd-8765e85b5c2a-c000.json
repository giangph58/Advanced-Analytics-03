{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09997v1\", \"title\": \"GenTe: Generative Real-world Terrains for General Legged Robot\\n  Locomotion Control\", \"summary\": \"Developing bipedal robots capable of traversing diverse real-world terrains\\npresents a fundamental robotics challenge, as existing methods using predefined\\nheight maps and static environments fail to address the complexity of\\nunstructured landscapes. To bridge this gap, we propose GenTe, a framework for\\ngenerating physically realistic and adaptable terrains to train generalizable\\nlocomotion policies. GenTe constructs an atomic terrain library that includes\\nboth geometric and physical terrains, enabling curriculum training for\\nreinforcement learning-based locomotion policies. By leveraging\\nfunction-calling techniques and reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language\\nModels (VLMs), GenTe generates complex, contextually relevant terrains from\\ntextual and graphical inputs. The framework introduces realistic force modeling\\nfor terrain interactions, capturing effects such as soil sinkage and\\nhydrodynamic resistance. To the best of our knowledge, GenTe is the first\\nframework that systemically generates simulation environments for legged robot\\nlocomotion control. Additionally, we introduce a benchmark of 100 generated\\nterrains. Experiments demonstrate improved generalization and robustness in\\nbipedal robot locomotion.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:01:44Z\"}"}
