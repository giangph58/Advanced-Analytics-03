{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05049v1\", \"title\": \"CMaP-SAM: Contraction Mapping Prior for SAM-driven Few-shot Segmentation\", \"summary\": \"Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to segment new classes using few annotated\\nimages. While recent FSS methods have shown considerable improvements by\\nleveraging Segment Anything Model (SAM), they face two critical limitations:\\ninsufficient utilization of structural correlations in query images, and\\nsignificant information loss when converting continuous position priors to\\ndiscrete point prompts. To address these challenges, we propose CMaP-SAM, a\\nnovel framework that introduces contraction mapping theory to optimize position\\npriors for SAM-driven few-shot segmentation. CMaP-SAM consists of three key\\ncomponents: (1) a contraction mapping module that formulates position prior\\noptimization as a Banach contraction mapping with convergence guarantees. This\\nmodule iteratively refines position priors through pixel-wise structural\\nsimilarity, generating a converged prior that preserves both semantic guidance\\nfrom reference images and structural correlations in query images; (2) an\\nadaptive distribution alignment module bridging continuous priors with SAM's\\nbinary mask prompt encoder; and (3) a foreground-background decoupled\\nrefinement architecture producing accurate final segmentation masks. Extensive\\nexperiments demonstrate CMaP-SAM's effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art\\nperformance with 71.1 mIoU on PASCAL-$5^i$ and 56.1 on COCO-$20^i$ datasets.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:19:16Z\"}"}
