This work analyzes the implementation of rectified\\nlinear unit neural networks to achieve constrained control in differentially\\nflat systems. Specifically, the class of flat systems enjoys the benefit of\\nfeedback linearizability, i.e., the systems can be linearized by means of a\\nproper variable transformation. However, the price for linearizing the dynamics\\nis that the constraint descriptions are distorted geometrically. Our results\\nshow that, by using neural networks, these constraints can be represented as a\\nunion of polytopes, enabling the use of mixed-integer programming tools to\\nguarantee constraint satisfaction. We further analyze the integration of the\\ncharacterization into efficient settings such as control Lyapunov\\nfunction-based and model predictive control (MPC). Interestingly, this\\ndescription also allows us to explicitly compute the solution of the MPC\\nproblem for the nonlinear system. Several examples are provided to illustrate\\nthe effectiveness of our framework.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T12:57:13Z\"}"}
