While the lowest two bands correspond to spin-$1/2$\\nfermions, the fermions in the highest band are of spin-$3/2$. Because the bands\\nare for different species of fermions, the particle-hole excitation channel\\nacross the bands is closed. However, fractionalized excitations as spin-$1/2$\\nand spin-$3/2$ fermions in pairs open a cooperon channel of excitations in\\nRaman scattering. The background spectral intensity profile obtained by Raman\\nscattering measurements in Na$_2$Cu$_3$Ge$_4$O$_{12}$ having a trimer chain\\nconsisting of spin-$1/2$ Cu ions, has comprehensively been shown to be\\nconsistent with these excitations.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T13:11:10Z\"}"}
