However, there is little known about their\\nfunctionality and degradation under over-voltaging or high average power\\ndissipation conditions that could therefore hinder their continual design and\\noptimization toward better performance. The experiments on a Si seven layer\\nDSRD conducted in the present paper allowed to broaden the understanding of its\\nopening switching performance under over-voltaging conditions. A striking\\ndesynchronization was discovered and linked to junction and electro-neutral\\nregion damage through experiments and PSpice modelling.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.app-ph,physics.ins-det\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:10:48Z\"}"}
