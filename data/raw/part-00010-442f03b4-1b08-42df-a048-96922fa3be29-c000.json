By representing product\\nlocations and order flows within a time-evolving graph structure, we employ\\nunsupervised clustering to define and refine compact order regions, effectively\\nreducing picking distances. We describe the procedure using a dynamic\\nmathematical model formulated using tools from random dynamical systems theory,\\nenabling a principled analysis of the system's behavior over time even under\\nrandom operational variations. For routing within this framework, we implement\\na parallelized Bellman-Ford algorithm, utilizing GPU acceleration to evaluate\\npath segments efficiently. To address scalability challenges inherent in large\\nrouting graphs, we introduce a segmentation strategy that preserves performance\\nwhile maintaining tractable memory requirements. Our results demonstrate\\nsignificant improvements in both operational efficiency and computational\\nfeasibility for large-scale warehouse environments.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.DS,math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T11:27:41Z\"}"}
