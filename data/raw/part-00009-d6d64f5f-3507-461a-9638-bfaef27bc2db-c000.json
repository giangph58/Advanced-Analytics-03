It proposes a flexible geometric framework\\nwithin which existing solution methods can be recast and improved, and new ones\\ncan be designed. Almost sure weak, strong, and linear convergence results are\\nestablished in particular for fixed point and feasibility problems. In these\\nareas, the proposed algorithms exceed the features of the state of the art in\\nseveral respects. Numerical applications to signal and image recovery are\\nprovided.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T16:57:22Z\"}"}
