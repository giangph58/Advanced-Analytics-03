There are\\ntwo basis elements for each degree of $\\\\mathbb{Z}_2^3\\\\setminus\\\\{(0,0,0)\\\\}$,\\nthus yielding 14 basis elements. We give a general and simple closed form\\nexpression for commutators between these basis elements. Next, we use this\\n$\\\\mathbb{Z}_2^3$-grading in order to examine graded color algebras. Our\\nanalysis yields three different $\\\\mathbb{Z}_2^3$-graded color algebras of type\\n$G_2$. Since the $\\\\mathbb{Z}_2^3$-grading is not compatible with a Cartan-Weyl\\nbasis of $G_2$, we also study another grading of $G_2$. This is a\\n$\\\\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-grading, compatible with a Cartan-Weyl basis, and for which we\\ncan also construct a $\\\\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded color algebra of type $G_2$.\", \"main_category\": \"math-ph\", \"categories\": \"math-ph,math.GR,math.MP,math.RA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T12:59:32Z\"}"}
