{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14894v1\", \"title\": \"Never too Cocky to Cooperate: An FIM and RL-based USV-AUV Collaborative\\n  System for Underwater Tasks in Extreme Sea Conditions\", \"summary\": \"This paper develops a novel unmanned surface vehicle (USV)-autonomous\\nunderwater vehicle (AUV) collaborative system designed to enhance underwater\\ntask performance in extreme sea conditions. The system integrates a dual\\nstrategy: (1) high-precision multi-AUV localization enabled by Fisher\\ninformation matrix-optimized USV path planning, and (2) reinforcement\\nlearning-based cooperative planning and control method for multi-AUV task\\nexecution. Extensive experimental evaluations in the underwater data collection\\ntask demonstrate the system's operational feasibility, with quantitative\\nresults showing significant performance improvements over baseline methods. The\\nproposed system exhibits robust coordination capabilities between USV and AUVs\\nwhile maintaining stability in extreme sea conditions. To facilitate\\nreproducibility and community advancement, we provide an open-source simulation\\ntoolkit available at: https://github.com/360ZMEM/USV-AUV-colab .\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T06:47:46Z\"}"}
