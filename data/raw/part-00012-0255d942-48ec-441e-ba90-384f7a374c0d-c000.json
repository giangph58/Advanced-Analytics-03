In this work, a\\nmultilayer perceptron and autoencoder (MLP + AE) hybrid neural network method\\nis introduced to extract preformation factors within the generalized liquid\\ndrop model and experimental data. A K-fold cross validation method is also\\nadopted. The accuracy of the preformation factor calculated by this improved\\nneural network is comparable to the results of the empirical formula. MLP + AE\\ncan effectively capture the linear relationship between the logarithm of the\\npreformation factor and the square root of the ratio of the decay energy,\\nfurther verifying that Geiger-Nuttall law can deal with preformation factor.\\nThe extracted preformation probability of isotope and isotone chains show\\ndifferent trends near the magic number, and in addition, an odd-even staggering\\neffect appears. This means that the preformation factors are affected by closed\\nshells and unpaired nucleons. Therefore the preformation factors can provide\\nnuclear structure information. Furthermore, for 41 new nuclides, the half-lives\\nintroduced with the preformation factors reproduce the experimental values as\\nexpected. Finally, the preformation factors and {\\\\alpha}-decay half-lives of Z\\n= 119 and 120 superheavy nuclei are predicted.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T11:08:49Z\"}"}
