Previous methods\\nusually adopt large-scale models, focusing on view-invariant features. However,\\nthey overlook the semantic information in person attributes. Additionally,\\nexisting training strategies often rely on full fine-tuning large-scale models,\\nwhich significantly increases training costs. To address these issues, we\\npropose a novel framework named LATex for AG-ReID, which adopts prompt-tuning\\nstrategies to leverage attribute-based text knowledge. More specifically, we\\nfirst introduce the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model as the\\nbackbone, and propose an Attribute-aware Image Encoder (AIE) to extract global\\nsemantic features and attribute-aware features. Then, with these features, we\\npropose a Prompted Attribute Classifier Group (PACG) to generate person\\nattribute predictions and obtain the encoded representations of predicted\\nattributes. Finally, we design a Coupled Prompt Template (CPT) to transform\\nattribute tokens and view information into structured sentences. These\\nsentences are processed by the text encoder of CLIP to generate more\\ndiscriminative features. As a result, our framework can fully leverage\\nattribute-based text knowledge to improve the AG-ReID. Extensive experiments on\\nthree AG-ReID benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed LATex.\\nThe source code will be available.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T04:47:05Z\"}"}
