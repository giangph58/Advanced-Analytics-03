The non-local terms in the anomaly-induced\\neffective action do not depend on the scheme of quantum calculations. On the\\nother hand, total derivative terms in the anomaly and the corresponding local\\npart of the induced action manifest scheme dependence and multiplicative\\nanomaly.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T04:10:12Z\"}"}
