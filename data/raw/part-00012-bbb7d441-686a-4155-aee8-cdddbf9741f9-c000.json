However, determining the microscopic spin configurations that\\nstabilize such phases is a key challenge, especially when in-plane and\\nout-of-plane spin components coexist and compete. Here, we combine neutron\\nscattering and magnetic susceptibility experiments with simulations to\\ninvestigate the emergence of field-induced fractional plateaus and the related\\ncriticality in a frustrated magnet holmium tetraboride (HoB4) that represents\\nthe family of rare earth tetraborides that crystalize in a Shastry-Sutherland\\nlattice in the ab plane. We focus on the interplay between classical and\\nquantum criticality near phase boundaries as well as the role of material\\ndefects in the stabilization of the ordered phases. We find that simulations\\nusing classical annealing can explain certain observed features in the\\nexperimental Laue diffraction and the origin of multiple magnetization\\nplateaus. Our results show that defects and out of plane interactions play an\\nimportant role and can guide the route towards resolving microscopic spin\\ntextures in highly frustrated magnets.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T15:05:09Z\"}"}
