{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17607v1\", \"title\": \"Time-resolved dynamics of GaN waveguide polaritons\", \"summary\": \"We implement a new experimental approach to directly measure the lifetime of\\nguided polaritons arising from the strong-coupling of GaN excitons and the\\nguided photonic modes of a slab waveguide. Using a Fourier imaging setup,\\ncombined with spatial filtering of the emission, the emission associated to\\npolaritonic modes with well-defined propagation constants can be selectively\\nanalyzed in the temporal domain. By directing it to the entrance slit of a\\nstreak camera, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements along the\\npolariton dispersion branch were performed at 40 K, enabling to assess the time\\ndecay of polariton modes. By combining this information with the\\nphotonic/excitonic fraction corresponding to each polariton mode, extracted\\nfrom a coupled-oscillators model that indicate a Rabi splitting of $\\\\Omega$ =\\n80 meV, we could extract the photon lifetime in the waveguide $\\\\tau_\\\\gamma\\\\,\\n=\\\\, 3\\\\pm 1$ ps. This corresponds to a record $Q$-factor in the UV of 16 000.\\nThe excitonic reservoir lifetime, which contributes to polariton formation, was\\ndetermined through TRPL measurements on excitonic luminescence. Finally,\\nmeasurements conducted at lower temperature highlight secondary feeding\\nmechanisms for the guided polaritonic mode, either via photon recycling from\\nthe AlGaN cladding layer or through resonant injection of photons from\\ntransitions below the band gap.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:33:50Z\"}"}
