For the\\nEquation-of-State we employ a density and momentum dependent potential from the\\nChiral-Mean-Field model. Light nuclei and hypernuclei production is described\\nat kinetic freeze-out via a coalescence mechanism or with a statistical\\nmulti-fragmentation calculation. The directed flow $v_1$ of p, d, t, $^3$He,\\n$^4$He as well as the $\\\\Lambda$, $^3_\\\\Lambda$H and $^4_\\\\Lambda$H is shown to\\napproximately scale with mass number $A$ of the light cluster in both\\ncalculations. This is in agreement with the experimental results for the\\ndirected flow measured by STAR. Predictions for the directed and elliptic flow\\nof (hyper)nuclei at further RHIC-FXT and FAIR energies show that the scaling\\nproperties should improve as the beam energy is increased.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T09:13:34Z\"}"}
