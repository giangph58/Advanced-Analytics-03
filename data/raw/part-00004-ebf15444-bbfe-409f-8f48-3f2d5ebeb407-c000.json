{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02379v1\", \"title\": \"The Spear and the Ring: Emergent Structures in Magnetic Colloidal\\n  Suspensions\", \"summary\": \"We study from a mathematical point of view the nanoparticle model of a\\nmagnetic colloid, presented by G. Klughertz. Our objective is to obtain\\nproperties of stable stationary structures that arise in the long-time limit\\nfor the magnetic nanoparticles dynamics following this model. In this article,\\nwe present a detailed study of two specific structures using techniques from\\nthe calculus of variations. The first, called the spear, consists of a chain of\\naligned particles interacting via a Lennard-Jones potential. We establish\\nexistence and uniqueness results, derive bounds on the distances between\\nneighboring particles, and provide a sharp asymptotic description as the number\\nof particles tends to infinity. The second structure, the ring, features\\nparticles uniformly distributed along a circle. We prove its existence and\\nuniqueness and derive an explicit formula for its radius.\", \"main_category\": \"math-ph\", \"categories\": \"math-ph,math.MP,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T08:16:38Z\"}"}
