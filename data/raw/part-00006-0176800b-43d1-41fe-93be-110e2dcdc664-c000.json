A lingo is a dialect's key security component by making attackers\\nunable to \\\"speak\\\" the lingo. A lingo's \\\"talk\\\" changes all the time, becoming a\\nmoving target for attackers. We present several kinds of lingo transformations\\nand compositions to generate stronger lingos from simpler ones, thus making\\ndialects more secure.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T11:08:18Z\"}"}
