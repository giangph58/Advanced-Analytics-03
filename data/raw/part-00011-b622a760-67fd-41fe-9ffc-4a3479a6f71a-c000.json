We present StealthRank, a novel adversarial ranking attack that\\nmanipulates LLM-driven product recommendation systems while maintaining textual\\nfluency and stealth. Unlike existing methods that often introduce detectable\\nanomalies, StealthRank employs an energy-based optimization framework combined\\nwith Langevin dynamics to generate StealthRank Prompts (SRPs)-adversarial text\\nsequences embedded within product descriptions that subtly yet effectively\\ninfluence LLM ranking mechanisms. We evaluate StealthRank across multiple LLMs,\\ndemonstrating its ability to covertly boost the ranking of target products\\nwhile avoiding explicit manipulation traces that can be easily detected. Our\\nresults show that StealthRank consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\\nadversarial ranking baselines in both effectiveness and stealth, highlighting\\ncritical vulnerabilities in LLM-driven recommendation systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T08:36:18Z\"}"}
