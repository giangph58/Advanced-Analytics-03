The gradient property of the memristive elements is\\nexploited to split the current to voltage operator as the sum of the derivative\\noperator, a Riemannian gradient operator, and a nonlinear residual operator\\nthat is linearized at each step of the algorithm. The diagonal structure of the\\nthree operators makes the variable metric forward-backward splitting algorithm\\nscalable and amenable to the simulation of large-scale neuromorphic circuits.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T11:34:31Z\"}"}
