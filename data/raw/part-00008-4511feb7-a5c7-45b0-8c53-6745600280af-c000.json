While classical results often assume constant\\ndiffusion and gradient-based drifts, we extend the analysis to spatially\\ninhomogeneous diffusion and non-integrable vector fields. We establish\\nsufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of stationary measures\\nunder global contraction, showing that convergence is preserved when the\\ncontraction rate dominates diffusion inhomogeneity. For systems contracting\\nonly outside of a compact set and with constant diffusion, we demonstrate mass\\nconcentration near the minima of an associated non-convex potential, like in\\nmultistable regimes. The theoretical findings are illustrated through Hopfield\\nnetworks, highlighting implications for memory retrieval dynamics in noisy\\nenvironments.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS,math-ph,math.AP,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T04:24:39Z\"}"}
