{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01869v1\", \"title\": \"Buggin: Automatic intrinsic bugs classification model using NLP and ML\", \"summary\": \"Recent studies have shown that bugs can be categorized into intrinsic and\\nextrinsic types. Intrinsic bugs can be backtracked to specific changes in the\\nversion control system (VCS), while extrinsic bugs originate from external\\nchanges to the VCS and lack a direct bug-inducing change. Using only intrinsic\\nbugs to train bug prediction models has been reported as beneficial to improve\\nthe performance of such models. However, there is currently no automated\\napproach to identify intrinsic bugs. To bridge this gap, our study employs\\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically identify\\nintrinsic bugs. Specifically, we utilize two embedding techniques, seBERT and\\nTF-IDF, applied to the title and description text of bug reports. The resulting\\nembeddings are fed into well-established machine learning algorithms such as\\nSupport Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and\\nK-Nearest Neighbors. The primary objective of this paper is to assess the\\nperformance of various NLP and machine learning techniques in identifying\\nintrinsic bugs using the textual information extracted from bug reports. The\\nresults demonstrate that both seBERT and TF-IDF can be effectively utilized for\\nintrinsic bug identification. The highest performance scores were achieved by\\ncombining TF-IDF with the Decision Tree algorithm and utilizing the bug titles\\n(yielding an F1 score of 78%). This was closely followed by seBERT, Support\\nVector Machine, and bug titles (with an F1 score of 77%). In summary, this\\npaper introduces an innovative approach that automates the identification of\\nintrinsic bugs using textual information derived from bug reports.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T16:23:08Z\"}"}
