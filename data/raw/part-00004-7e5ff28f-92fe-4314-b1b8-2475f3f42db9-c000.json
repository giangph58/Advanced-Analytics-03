The first one has an explicit description as $2$-term complexes\\nof smooth commutative group algebraic spaces. Using the second-named author's\\nduality results arXiv:1806.07641, we prove that they are equivalent to the\\nopposite of the categories of torsion-free $\\\\mathbb{Z}$-constructible sheaves\\nand all $\\\\mathbb{Z}$-constructible sheaves, respectively. We then define\\n$L$-functions for constructible tori over a Dedekind scheme proper over\\n$\\\\mathrm{Spec}(\\\\mathbb{Z})$ in terms of their \\\\'etale realizations and prove a\\nspecial value formula at $s=0$ using the Weil-\\\\'etale formalism developed by\\nthe first-named author in arXiv:2210.09102. This extends the results of the\\nfirst-named author by removing the tame ramification hypothesis.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG,math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:36:20Z\"}"}
