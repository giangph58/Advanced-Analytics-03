One common strategy is to introduce an external field to\\nprevent the plasma distribution from developing turbulence. However, finding\\nsuch external fields efficiently remains an open question, even for simplified\\nmodels such as the Vlasov-Poisson (VP) system. In this work, we leverage two\\ndifferent approaches to build such fields: for the first approach, we use an\\nanalytical derivation of the dispersion relation of the VP system to find a\\nrange of reasonable fields that can potentially suppress instability, providing\\na qualitative suggestion. For the second approach, we leverage PDE-constrained\\noptimization to obtain a locally optimal field using different loss functions.\\nAs the stability of the system can be characterized in several different ways,\\nthe objective functions need to be tailored accordingly. We show, through\\nextensive numerical tests, that objective functions such as the relative\\nentropy (KL divergence) and the $L^{2}$ norm result in a highly non-convex\\nproblem, rendering the global minimum difficult to find. However, we show that\\nusing the electric energy of the system as a loss function is advantageous, as\\nit has a large convex basin close to the global minimum. Unfortunately, outside\\nthe basin, the electric energy landscape consists of unphysical flat local\\nminima, thus rendering a good initial guess key for the overall convergence of\\nthe optimization problem, particularly for solvers with adaptive steps.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:26:09Z\"}"}
