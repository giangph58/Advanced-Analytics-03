The effective\\ngeometry has a transition surface that connects trapped and anti-trapped\\nregions with the same mass. There is a minimum mass for which the horizon\\ntemperature and Komar energy are zero, and the black hole stops its Hawking\\nevaporation. For horizons above this limit, we present the grey-body factors,\\nemission spectra, and the mass loss rate, solving a one-dimensional\\nSchrdinger-type equation with an effective short-range potential barrier for\\nmassless fields of spins 0, 1/2, 1 and 2.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T15:19:03Z\"}"}
