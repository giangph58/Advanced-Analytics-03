Three benchmark problems are considered,\\nranging from 1D free-space wave propagation to 2D Gaussian pulses in periodic\\nand dielectric media. We assess the effectiveness of convergence-enhancing\\nstrategies for PINNs, including random Fourier features, spatio-temporal\\nperiodicity, and temporal causality training. An ablation study highlights that\\narchitectural choices must align with the underlying physics. Additionally, we\\nemploy a Neural Tangent Kernel framework to examine the spatio-temporal\\nconvergence behavior of PINNs. Results show that convergence rates correlate\\nwith error over time but not in space, revealing a limitation in how training\\ndynamics allocate learning effort. Overall, this study demonstrates that PINNs,\\nwhen properly configured, can match or surpass traditional solvers in accuracy\\nand flexibility, though challenges remain in addressing spatial inhomogeneity\\nand adapting training to localized complexity.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T14:56:17Z\"}"}
