There are excellent short- and mid-term prospects for\\nsignificantly improved measurements in heavy flavour physics (involving b and c\\nhadrons and $\\\\tau$ leptons), with upgrades in progress or planned for the\\nATLAS, CMS and LHCb experiments exploiting proton-proton collisions at CERN's\\nLarge Hadron Collider, and for the Belle II experiment operating with\\nelectron-positron collisions from the SuperKEKB accelerator in KEK. The\\nexpected sensitivities that can be achieved from these experiments for a number\\nof key observables are presented, highlighting the complementarity of the\\ndifferent experiments and showing how the precision will improve with time.\\nThis international programme in heavy flavour physics will result in\\nunprecedented capability to probe this sector of the Standard Model and,\\npotentially, observe imprints of physics at higher energy scales than can be\\naccessed directly.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:32:03Z\"}"}
