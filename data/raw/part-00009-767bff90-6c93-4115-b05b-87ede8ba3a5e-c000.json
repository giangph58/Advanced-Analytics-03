{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07480v1\", \"title\": \"Echoes of Disagreement: Measuring Disparity in Social Consensus\", \"summary\": \"Public discourse and opinions stem from multiple social groups. Each group\\nhas beliefs about a topic (such as vaccination, abortion, gay marriage, etc.),\\nand opinions are exchanged and blended to produce consensus. A particular\\nmeasure of interest corresponds to measuring the influence of each group on the\\nconsensus and the disparity between groups on the extent to which they\\ninfluence the consensus. In this paper, we study and give provable algorithms\\nfor optimizing the disparity under the DeGroot or the Friedkin-Johnsen models\\nof opinion dynamics. Our findings provide simple poly-time algorithms to\\noptimize disparity for most cases, fully characterize the instances that\\noptimize disparity, and show how simple interventions such as contracting\\nvertices or adding links affect disparity. Finally, we test our developed\\nalgorithms in a variety of real-world datasets.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SI\", \"categories\": \"cs.SI,physics.soc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T06:18:27Z\"}"}
