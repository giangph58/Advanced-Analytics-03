{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11039v1\", \"title\": \"Modeling dislocations in quasicrystals through amplitude equations\", \"summary\": \"Quasicrystals (QCs) are a class of aperiodic ordered structures that emerge\\nin various systems, from metallic alloys to soft matter and driven\\nnon-equilibrium systems. Within a mesoscale theory based on slowly-varying\\ncomplex amplitudes for QCs, we track dislocations as topological defects\\nharbored by the amplitudes and characterize their Burgers vectors and induced\\ndeformations. We study the formation of dislocations at semicoherent\\ninterfaces, particularly those emerging from rotated inclusions, and find a\\nhierarchy of dislocations forming at such interfaces. We further analyze\\ninterfaces in strained systems, revealing conditions for the emergence of\\nperiodic dislocation arrays and discussing the energetics of dislocations\\nassociated with different phonon and phason deformations. The stability,\\ninteraction, and motion of dislocation dipoles and quadrupoles are also\\ndiscussed. These findings provide new insights into the mesoscale modeling of\\ndislocations in QCs and their distinct behavior compared to conventional\\ncrystals, while demonstrating a versatile framework for studying dislocations\\nin systems exhibiting quasicrystalline order.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T10:03:41Z\"}"}
