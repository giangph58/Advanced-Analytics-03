In this work, we quantify the entanglement of states in\\nunresolvable spin ensembles, which are inherently mixed. By exploiting their\\npermutationally invariant properties, we show that the bipartite entanglement\\nof a wide range of unresolvable ensemble states can be calculated exactly. Our\\nformalism is versatile; it can be used to evaluate the entanglement in an\\nensemble with an arbitrary number of particles, effective angular momentum, and\\nbipartition. We apply our method to explore the characteristics of entanglement\\nin different physically motivated scenarios, including states with definite\\nmagnetization and metrologically useful superpositions such as\\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and spin-squeezed states. Our method\\ncan help understand the role of entanglement in spin-ensemble-based quantum\\ntechnologies.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T04:35:05Z\"}"}
