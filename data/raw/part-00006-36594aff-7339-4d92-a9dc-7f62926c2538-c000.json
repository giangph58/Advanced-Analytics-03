We introduce\\nOmicsCL, a modular contrastive learning framework that jointly embeds\\nheterogeneous omics modalities-such as gene expression, DNA methylation, and\\nmiRNA expression-into a unified latent space. Our method incorporates a\\nsurvival-aware contrastive loss that encourages the model to learn\\nrepresentations aligned with survival-related patterns, without relying on\\nlabeled outcomes. Evaluated on the TCGA BRCA dataset, OmicsCL uncovers\\nclinically meaningful clusters and achieves strong unsupervised concordance\\nwith patient survival. The framework demonstrates robustness across\\nhyperparameter configurations and can be tuned to prioritize either subtype\\ncoherence or survival stratification. Ablation studies confirm that integrating\\nsurvival-aware loss significantly enhances the predictive power of learned\\nembeddings. These results highlight the promise of contrastive objectives for\\nbiological insight discovery in high-dimensional, heterogeneous omics data.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,q-bio.GN,q-bio.QM\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T16:51:48Z\"}"}
