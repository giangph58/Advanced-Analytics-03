Our timing analysis\\nrevealed a pulsation period of approximately 7.02 s in the X-ray light curve.\\nThe pulse profile obtained in the broad energy range is double-peaked and\\nasymmetric in nature and shows moderate variation with the energy. An absorbed\\npower-law model describes the 0.5-8 keV NICER spectra well. The 3-50 keV NuSTAR\\nspectrum is best described with an absorbed power-law modified with a\\nhigh-energy cutoff model. We find no evidence of iron or cyclotron line\\nfeatures in the energy spectrum. During our observation period, the 0.5-50 keV\\nluminosity varies in the range of $\\\\sim 8\\\\times10^{36} - 4\\\\times10^{37}$ erg\\ns$^{-1}$. We also discuss the dependence of spectral parameters on the\\nrotational phase of the pulsar through phase-resolved spectroscopy.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:12:36Z\"}"}
