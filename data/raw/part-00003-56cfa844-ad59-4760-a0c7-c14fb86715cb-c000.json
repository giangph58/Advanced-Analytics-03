The focus of our contribution is on\\nan optimal a priori error estimate for a contractive Picard type iteration\\nscheme on meshes that are locally refined towards possible corner singularities\\nin polygonal domains. Our analysis involves, in particular, an elliptic\\nregularity result in weighted Sobolev spaces and the use of the Trudinger\\ninequality, which is instrumental in dealing with subcritically growing\\nnonlinearities. A series of numerical experiments confirm the accuracy and\\nefficiency of our method.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:32:26Z\"}"}
