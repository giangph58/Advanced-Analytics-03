Indeed, given\\nthe existence of more than 200 formulations of DP (and counting), before even\\nattempting to answer the titular question one must first precisely specify what\\nit actually means to be DP. Motivated by this observation, a theoretical\\ninvestigation into DP's fundamental essence resulted in Part I of this trio,\\nwhich introduces a five-building-block system explicating the who, where, what,\\nhow and how much aspects of DP. Instantiating this system in the context of the\\nUnited States Decennial Census, Part II then demonstrates the broader\\napplicability and relevance of DP by comparing a swapping strategy like that\\nused in 2010 with the TopDown Algorithm$\\\\unicode{x2014}$a DP method adopted in\\nthe 2020 Census. This paper provides nontechnical summaries of the preceding\\ntwo parts as well as new discussion$\\\\unicode{x2014}$for example, on how greater\\nawareness of the five building blocks can thwart privacy theatrics; how our\\nresults bridging traditional SDC and DP allow a data custodian to reap the\\nbenefits of both these fields; how invariants impact disclosure risk; and how\\nremoving the implicit reliance on aleatoric uncertainty could lead to new\\ngeneralizations of DP.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,stat.OT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T17:19:57Z\"}"}
