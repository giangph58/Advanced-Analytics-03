{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02814v1\", \"title\": \"Convergence of the Markovian iteration for coupled FBSDEs via a\\n  differentiation approach\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we investigate the Markovian iteration method for solving\\ncoupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) featuring a\\nfully coupled forward drift, meaning the drift term explicitly depends on both\\nthe forward and backward processes. An FBSDE system typically involves three\\nstochastic processes: the forward process $X$, the backward process $Y$\\nrepresenting the solution, and the $Z$ process corresponding to the scaled\\nderivative of $Y$. Prior research by Bender and Zhang (2008) has established\\nconvergence results for iterative schemes dealing with $Y$-coupled FBSDEs.\\nHowever, extending these results to equations with $Z$ coupling poses\\nsignificant challenges, especially in uniformly controlling the Lipschitz\\nconstant of the decoupling fields across iterations and time steps within a\\nfixed-point framework.\\n  To overcome this issue, we propose a novel differentiation-based method for\\nhandling the $Z$ process. This approach enables improved management of the\\nLipschitz continuity of decoupling fields, facilitating the well-posedness of\\nthe discretized FBSDE system with fully coupled drift. We rigorously prove the\\nconvergence of our Markovian iteration method in this more complex setting.\\nFinally, numerical experiments confirm our theoretical insights, showcasing the\\neffectiveness and accuracy of the proposed methodology.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA,math.PR,q-fin.CP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T17:56:36Z\"}"}
