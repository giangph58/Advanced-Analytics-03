We investigate the interaction between the\\ndomain wall and a periodic background field, which can induce perturbations in\\nthe oscillatory behavior of the wall. We propose a novel mechanism for\\nresolving the domain wall problem through the phenomenon of resonant\\noscillation. Resonant oscillation occurs when the frequency of the external\\ndriving force aligns with the intrinsic frequency of the domain wall. This\\nsynchrony can significantly amplify the amplitude of the oscillation. If the\\namplitude of oscillation exceeds a predetermined critical deformation\\nthreshold, the domain wall may be deconstructed. Furthermore, we demonstrate\\nthat this mechanism remains valid in models that preserve discrete symmetry.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T10:35:42Z\"}"}
