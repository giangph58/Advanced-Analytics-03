Let ${\\nZ}_n$ be the $p\\\\times q$ upper-left submatrix of ${\\\\Gamma}_n$ and ${G}_n$ be a\\n$p\\\\times q$ matrix whose $pq$ entries are independent standard normals, where\\n$p$ and $q$ are two positive integers.

Consider the\\nFisher information $I(\\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\sqrt{n} { Z}_n)|\\\\mathcal{L}(G_n))$ between\\nthe distributions of $\\\\sqrt{n} {Z}_n$ and ${ G}_n.$ In this paper, we conclude\\nthat $$I(\\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\sqrt{n} {Z}_n)|\\\\mathcal{L}(G_n))\\\\longrightarrow 0 $$ as\\n$n\\\\to\\\\infty$ if $pq=o(n)$ and it does not tend to zero if\\n$c=\\\\lim\\\\limits_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\frac{pq}{n}\\\\in(0, +\\\\infty).$ Precisely, we obtain\\nthat $$I(\\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\sqrt{n}\\n{Z}_n)|\\\\mathcal{L}(G_n))=\\\\frac{p^2q(q+1)}{4n^2}(1+o(1))$$ when $p=o(n).$\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T05:38:13Z\"}"}
