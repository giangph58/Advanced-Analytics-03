{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17246v1\", \"title\": \"A Sandwich Model for Changing-Look AGNs\", \"summary\": \"The spectral variability of changing-look active galactic nuclei (CL-AGNs)\\noccurred on timescales of years to tens of years, posing a significant\\nchallenge to the standard thin disk model. In this work, we propose a sandwich\\nmodel, including an optically thick disk in the mid-plane (Disk 1) and two\\ndisks of low effective optical depth on both sides (Disk 2). These two types of\\ndisks are coupled with magnetic fields, which allow viscous torque interaction\\nbetween them. As a consequence, the radial velocity of Disk 1 can increase by\\nup to three orders of magnitude compared to the standard thin disk, leading to\\nan equivalent decrease in the accretion timescale. Therefore, such a sandwich\\nmodel can account for the rapid variability in CL-AGNs. In addition, we also\\ndiscuss the influence of the magnetic pressure on Disk 2. When Disk 2 is\\ndominated by the magnetic pressure, it resembles a \\\"warm corona\\\", which is\\nresponsible for the soft X-ray excess.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T04:49:19Z\"}"}
