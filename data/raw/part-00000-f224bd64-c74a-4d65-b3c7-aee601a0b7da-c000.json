This study investigates\\nhow socio-structural characteristics such as the age, gender, and race of CCs\\nbut also platform features including the number of subscribers, community\\nstrength, and the channel topic shape differences in the occurrence of these\\nphenomena on that platform. Drawing on a random sample of n=3,695 YouTube\\nchannels from German-speaking countries, we conduct a comprehensive analysis\\ncombining digital trace data, enhanced with hand-coded variables to include\\nsocio-structural characteristics in social media data. Publicly visible\\nnegative sentiment, offensive language, and hate speech are detected with\\nmachine- and deep-learning methods using N=40,000,000 comments. Contrary to\\nexisting studies our findings indicate that female content creators are\\nconfronted with less negative communication. Notably, our analysis reveals that\\nwhile BIPoC, who work as CCs, receive significantly more negative sentiment,\\nthey aren't exposed to more offensive comments or hate speech. Additionally,\\nplatform characteristics also play a crucial role, as channels publishing\\ncontent on conspiracy theories or politics are more frequently subject to\\nnegative communication.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY,J.4\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T11:58:56Z\"}"}
