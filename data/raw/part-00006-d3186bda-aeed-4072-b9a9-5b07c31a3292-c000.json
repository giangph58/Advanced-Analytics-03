Detecting biosignature gases\\nvia exoplanet atmosphere transmission spectroscopy is in principle within\\nJWST's reach. We reflect on JWST's early results in the context of the\\npotential search for biological activity on exoplanets. The results confront us\\nwith a complex reality. Established inverse methods to interpret observed\\nspectra-already known to be highly averaged representations of intricate 3D\\natmospheric processes-can lead to disparate interpretations even with JWST's\\nquality of data. Characterizing rocky or sub-Neptune-size exoplanets with JWST\\nis an intricate task, and moves us away from the notion of finding a definitive\\n\\\"silver bullet\\\" biosignature gas. Indeed, JWST results necessitate us to allow\\n\\\"parallel interpretations\\\" that will perhaps not be resolved until the next\\ngeneration of observatories. Nonetheless, with a handful of habitable-zone\\nplanet atmospheres accessible given the anticipated noise floor, JWST may\\ncontinue to contribute to this journey by designating a planet as biosignature\\ngas candidate. To do this we will need to sufficiently refine our inverse\\nmethods and physical models for confidently quantifying specific gas abundances\\nand constraining the atmosphere context. Looking ahead, future telescopes and\\ninnovative observational strategies will be essential for the reliable\\ndetection of biosignature gases.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T13:48:43Z\"}"}
