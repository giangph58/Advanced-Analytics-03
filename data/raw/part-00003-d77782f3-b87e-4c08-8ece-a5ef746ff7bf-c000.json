{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20623v1\", \"title\": \"Cell-free Fluid Antenna Multiple Access Networks\", \"summary\": \"Fluid antenna enables position reconfigurability that gives transceiver\\naccess to a high-resolution spatial signal and the ability to avoid\\ninterference through the ups and downs of fading channels. Previous studies\\ninvestigated this fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA) approach in a\\nsingle-cell setup only. In this paper, we consider a cell-free network\\narchitecture in which users are associated with the nearest base stations (BSs)\\nand all users share the same physical channel. Each BS has multiple fixed\\nantennas that employ maximum ratio transmission (MRT) to beam to its associated\\nusers while each user relies on its fluid antenna system (FAS) on one radio\\nfrequency (RF) chain to overcome the inter-user interference. Our aim is to\\nanalyze the outage probability performance of such cell-free FAMA network when\\nboth large- and small-scale fading effects are considered. To do so, we derive\\nthe distribution of the received \\\\textcolor{black}{magnitude} for a typical\\nuser and then the interference distribution under both fast and slow port\\nswitching techniques. The outage probability is finally obtained in integral\\nform in each case. Numerical results demonstrate that in an\\ninterference-limited situation, although fast port switching is typically\\nunderstood as the superior method for FAMA, slow port switching emerges as a\\nmore effective solution when there is a large antenna array at the BS.\\nMoreover, it is revealed that FAS at each user can serve to greatly reduce the\\nburden of BS in terms of both antenna costs and CSI estimation overhead,\\nthereby enhancing the scalability of cell-free networks.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T10:50:10Z\"}"}
