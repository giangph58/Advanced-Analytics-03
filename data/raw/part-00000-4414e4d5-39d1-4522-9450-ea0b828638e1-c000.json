{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11925v1\", \"title\": \"Reducing Calls to the Simulator in Simulation Based Inference (SBI)\", \"summary\": \"Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) deals with statistical inference in problems\\nwhere the data are generated from a system that is described by a complex\\nstochastic simulator. The challenge for inference in these problems is that the\\nlikelihood is intractable; SBI proceeds by using the simulator to sample from\\nthe likelihood. In many real world applications, simulator calls are expensive,\\nlimiting the associated sample size. Our goal in this work is to extend SBI to\\nexploit two proposals for reducing simulator calls: to draw likelihood samples\\nfrom a Neural Density Estimator (NDE) surrogate rather than from the stochastic\\nsimulator; and use of Support Points rather than simple random sampling to\\ngenerate evaluation sites. We embed these methods in the Sequential Neural\\nPosterior Estimator (SNPE) algorithm. Across a suite of test cases, we find\\nthat the NDE surrogate improves the quality of the inference; support points\\nworked well in some examples, but not in others.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.CO\", \"categories\": \"stat.CO,62-08\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T09:59:31Z\"}"}
