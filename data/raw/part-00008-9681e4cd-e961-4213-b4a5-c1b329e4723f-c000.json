Developed\\nas part of Mu-SHROOM, the Multilingual Shared-task on Hallucinations and\\nRelated Observable Overgeneration Mistakes, HalluSearch couples\\nretrieval-augmented verification with fine-grained factual splitting to\\nidentify and localize hallucinations in fourteen different languages. Empirical\\nevaluations show that HalluSearch performs competitively, placing fourth in\\nboth English (within the top ten percent) and Czech. While the system's\\nretrieval-based strategy generally proves robust, it faces challenges in\\nlanguages with limited online coverage, underscoring the need for further\\nresearch to ensure consistent hallucination detection across diverse linguistic\\ncontexts.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T12:22:30Z\"}"}
