Prior work has focused on meta-learning for\\nsupport-query matching, with extensive development in both prototype-based and\\naggregation-based methods. To address data scarcity, recent approaches have\\nturned to foundation models to enhance representation transferability for novel\\nclass segmentation. Among them, a hybrid dual-modal framework including both\\nDINOv2 and SAM has garnered attention due to their complementary capabilities.\\nWe wonder \\\"can we build a unified model with knowledge from both foundation\\nmodels?\\\" To this end, we propose FS-DINO, with only DINOv2's encoder and a\\nlightweight segmenter. The segmenter features a bottleneck adapter, a\\nmeta-visual prompt generator based on dense similarities and semantic\\nembeddings, and a decoder. Through coarse-to-fine cross-model distillation, we\\neffectively integrate SAM's knowledge into our lightweight segmenter, which can\\nbe further enhanced by 4D correlation mining on support-query pairs. Extensive\\nexperiments on COCO-20i, PASCAL-5i, and FSS-1000 demonstrate the effectiveness\\nand superiority of our method.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T07:47:06Z\"}"}
