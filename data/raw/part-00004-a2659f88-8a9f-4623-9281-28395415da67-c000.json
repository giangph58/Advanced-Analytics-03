Here we challenge this\\nparadigm by demonstrating pathway competitions using our newly developed\\nlight-induced mechanical absorption spectroscopy (LIMAS), which allows us to\\nprobe genuine recombination dynamics in semiconductors via mechanical damping.\\nWe show that the total recombination rate in zinc sulfide (ZnS), a model\\nsemiconductor material, follows a multiplicative weighting model, r_total\\n\\\\propto \\\\Pi r_i ^(w_i) with \\\\Sigma w_i=1. Under both steady-state and switch-on\\nilluminations, the weighting factors w_i for each recombination pathway-direct,\\ntrap-assisted, and sublinear-are dictated by the carrier generation mechanism:\\n(i) interband transition favors direct recombination; (ii) single-defect\\nlevel-mediated generation promotes trap-assisted recombination; (iii)\\ngeneration involving multiple saturated defect levels gives rise to sublinear\\nrecombination. Upon light switch-off, localized state changes drive a dynamic\\nevolution of w_i, altering pathway competitions. These findings reshape our\\nfundamental understanding of carrier dynamics and provide a new strategy to\\noptimize next-generation optoelectronic devices.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T15:01:38Z\"}"}
