However, such materials,\\nparticularly those with a full band gap, remain scarce. Given the limitations\\nof traditional approaches that scan known materials for candidates, we focus on\\nthe generation of new topological materials through a generative model.\\nSpecifically, we apply reinforcement fine-tuning (ReFT) to a pre-trained\\ngenerative model, thereby aligning the model's objectives with our material\\ndesign goals. We demonstrate that ReFT is effective in enhancing the model's\\nability to generate TIs and TCIs, with minimal compromise on the stability of\\nthe generated materials. Using the fine-tuned model, we successfully identify a\\nlarge number of new topological materials, with Ge$_2$Bi$_2$O$_6$ serving as a\\nrepresentative example--a TI with a full band gap of 0.26 eV, ranking among the\\nlargest known in this category.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T16:05:24Z\"}"}
