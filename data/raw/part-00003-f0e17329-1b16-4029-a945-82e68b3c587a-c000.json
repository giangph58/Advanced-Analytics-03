{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04485v1\", \"title\": \"FA-KPConv: Introducing Euclidean Symmetries to KPConv via Frame\\n  Averaging\", \"summary\": \"We present Frame-Averaging Kernel-Point Convolution (FA-KPConv), a neural\\nnetwork architecture built on top of the well-known KPConv, a widely adopted\\nbackbone for 3D point cloud analysis. Even though invariance and/or\\nequivariance to Euclidean transformations are required for many common tasks,\\nKPConv-based networks can only approximately achieve such properties when\\ntraining on large datasets or with significant data augmentations. Using Frame\\nAveraging, we allow to flexibly customize point cloud neural networks built\\nwith KPConv layers, by making them exactly invariant and/or equivariant to\\ntranslations, rotations and/or reflections of the input point clouds. By simply\\nwrapping around an existing KPConv-based network, FA-KPConv embeds geometrical\\nprior knowledge into it while preserving the number of learnable parameters and\\nnot compromising any input information. We showcase the benefit of such an\\nintroduced bias for point cloud classification and point cloud registration,\\nespecially in challenging cases such as scarce training data or randomly\\nrotated test data.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:58:04Z\"}"}
