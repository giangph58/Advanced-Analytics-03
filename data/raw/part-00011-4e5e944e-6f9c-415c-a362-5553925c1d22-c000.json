However, direct sunspot observations and reconstructions of long-term\\nsolar activity clearly exhibit amplitude fluctuations beyond the decadal\\ntimescale -- which may be termed as supradecadal modulation. Whether this\\nlong-term modulation in the Sun's magnetic activity results from nonlinear\\nmechanisms or stochastic perturbations remains controversial and a matter of\\nactive debate. Utilizing multi-millennial scale kinematic dynamo simulations\\nbased on the Babcock-Leighton paradigm -- in the likely (near-critical) regime\\nof operation of the solar dynamo -- we demonstrate that this supradecadal\\nmodulation in solar activity cannot be explained by nonlinear mechanisms alone;\\nstochastic forcing is essential for the manifestation of observed long-term\\nfluctuations in the near-critical dynamo regime. Our findings substantiate some\\nindependent observational and theoretical investigations, and provide\\nadditional insights into temporal dynamics associated with a plethora of\\nnatural phenomena in astronomy and planetary systems arising from weakly\\nnonlinear, non-deterministic processes.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T13:01:12Z\"}"}
