{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04877v1\", \"title\": \"SoK: LLM-based Log Parsing\", \"summary\": \"Log data, generated by software systems, provides crucial insights for tasks\\nlike monitoring, root cause analysis, and anomaly detection. Due to the vast\\nvolume of logs, automated log parsing is essential to transform semi-structured\\nlog messages into structured representations. Traditional log parsing\\ntechniques often require manual configurations, such as defining log formats or\\nlabeling data, which limits scalability and usability. Recent advances in large\\nlanguage models (LLMs) have introduced the new research field of LLM-based log\\nparsing, offering potential improvements in automation and adaptability.\\nDespite promising results, there is no structured overview of these approaches\\nsince this is a relatively new research field with the earliest advances\\npublished in late 2023. This paper systematically reviews 29 LLM-based log\\nparsing methods, comparing their capabilities, limitations, and reliance on\\nmanual effort. We analyze the learning and prompt-engineering paradigms\\nemployed, efficiency- and effectiveness-enhancing techniques, and the role of\\nLLMs in the parsing process. We aggregate the results of the survey in a large\\ntable comprising the characterizing features of LLM-based log parsing\\napproaches and derive the general process of LLM-based log parsing,\\nincorporating all reviewed approaches in a single flow chart. Additionally, we\\nbenchmark seven open-source LLM-based log parsers on public datasets and\\ncritically assess their reproducibility. Our findings summarize the advances of\\nthis new research field and provide insights for researchers and practitioners\\nseeking efficient and user-friendly log parsing solutions, with all code and\\nresults made publicly available for transparency.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T09:41:04Z\"}"}
