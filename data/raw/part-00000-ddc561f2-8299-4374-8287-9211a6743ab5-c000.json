{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11805v1\", \"title\": \"Network-Integrated Decoding System for Real-Time Quantum Error\\n  Correction with Lattice Surgery\", \"summary\": \"Existing real-time decoders for surface codes are limited to isolated logical\\nqubits and do not support logical operations involving multiple logical qubits.\\nWe present DECONET, a first-of-its-kind decoding system that scales to\\nthousands of logical qubits and supports logical operations implemented through\\nlattice surgery. DECONET organizes compute resources in a network-integrated\\nhybrid tree-grid structure, which results in minimal latency increase and no\\nthroughput degradation as the system grows. Specifically, DECONET can be scaled\\nto any arbitrary number of $l$ logical qubits by increasing the compute\\nresources by $O(l \\\\times log(l))$, which provides the required $O(l)$ growth in\\nI/O resources while incurring only an $O(log(l))$ increase in latency-a modest\\ngrowth that is sufficient for thousands of logical qubits. Moreover, we\\nanalytically show that the scaling approach preserves throughput, keeping\\nDECONET backlog-free for any number of logical qubits. We report an exploratory\\nprototype of DECONET, called DECONET/HELIOS, built with five VMK-180 FPGAs,\\nthat successfully decodes 100 logical qubits of distance five. For 100 logical\\nqubits, under a phenomenological noise rate of 0.1%, the DECONET/HELIOS has an\\naverage latency of 2.40 {\\\\mu}s and an inverse throughput of 0.84 {\\\\mu}s per\\nmeasurement round.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.DC,cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T06:37:12Z\"}"}
