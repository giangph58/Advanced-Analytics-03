{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04134v1\", \"title\": \"Loading and decay dynamics of an optical dipole trap using\\n  spatio-temporal Monte Carlo method\", \"summary\": \"Here, we present our studies on intra-trap dynamics of an optical dipole trap\\n(ODT) loaded from a Magneto-optical trap (MOT) of $^{87}$Rb atoms. A\\nspatio-temporal Monte Carlo (MC) simulation approach has been employed in\\nconjunction with the semi-classical theory based calculations for estimation of\\nvarious intra-trap two-body loss parameters in the ODT. The temporal MC method\\nbased on estimated parameters from spatial MC, gives a close estimation of the\\nexperimentally observed atom-number evolution in ODT. We also find that, the\\ndecay rate of atoms in an ODT is dominated by momentum-transfer elastic\\ncollisions in the absence of MOT beams. However, in presence of MOT beams, the\\nradiative escape process is the dominant two-body loss mechanism in the trap,\\nwhich surpasses the fine-structure changing and hyperfine changing collisional\\nlosses by nearly an order of magnitude.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T05:12:35Z\"}"}
