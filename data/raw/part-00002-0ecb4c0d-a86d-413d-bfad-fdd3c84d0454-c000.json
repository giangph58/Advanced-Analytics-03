Here, we use\\nGRACE ocean bottom pressure, reanalysis winds and \\\\textit{in situ} transport\\nestimates at $26^\\\\circ$N to diagnose the large-scale response of the deep ocean\\ncirculation to wind-forcing. We find that deep ocean transports -- including\\nthose associated with a reversal of the Atlantic meridional overturning\\ncirculation in 2009/10 and 2010/11 -- are part of a large-scale response to\\nwind stress curl over the intergyre-gyre region. Wind-forcing dominates deep\\nocean circulation variability on monthly timescales, but interannual\\nfluctuations in the residual \\\\textit{in situ} transports (after removing the\\nwind-effect) are also captured by GRACE bottom pressure measurements. On\\ndecadal timescales, uncertainty in regional trends in GRACE ocean bottom\\npressure preclude investigation of decadal-timescale transport trends.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T04:05:14Z\"}"}
