{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06120v1\", \"title\": \"Hyperbolic Category Discovery\", \"summary\": \"Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an intriguing open-world problem that\\nhas garnered increasing attention. Given a dataset that includes both labelled\\nand unlabelled images, GCD aims to categorize all images in the unlabelled\\nsubset, regardless of whether they belong to known or unknown classes. In GCD,\\nthe common practice typically involves applying a spherical projection operator\\nat the end of the self-supervised pretrained backbone, operating within\\nEuclidean or spherical space. However, both of these spaces have been shown to\\nbe suboptimal for encoding samples that possesses hierarchical structures. In\\ncontrast, hyperbolic space exhibits exponential volume growth relative to\\nradius, making it inherently strong at capturing the hierarchical structure of\\nsamples from both seen and unseen categories. Therefore, we propose to tackle\\nthe category discovery challenge in the hyperbolic space. We introduce HypCD, a\\nsimple \\\\underline{Hyp}erbolic framework for learning hierarchy-aware\\nrepresentations and classifiers for generalized \\\\underline{C}ategory\\n\\\\underline{D}iscovery. HypCD first transforms the Euclidean embedding space of\\nthe backbone network into hyperbolic space, facilitating subsequent\\nrepresentation and classification learning by considering both hyperbolic\\ndistance and the angle between samples. This approach is particularly helpful\\nfor knowledge transfer from known to unknown categories in GCD. We thoroughly\\nevaluate HypCD on public GCD benchmarks, by applying it to various baseline and\\nstate-of-the-art methods, consistently achieving significant improvements.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T15:12:33Z\"}"}
