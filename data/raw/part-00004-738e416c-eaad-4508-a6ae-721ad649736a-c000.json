In this work, we\\ninvestigate short-duration population transfer between the ground and first\\nexcited states of a ladder-type qutrit, with the goal of minimizing leakage\\ninto the second excited state. Our multiobjective approach seeks to reduce the\\nmaximum transient second-state population and maximize detuning robustness.\\nInspired by two-state models, such as the Allen-Eberly and Hioe-Carroll models,\\nwe extend these concepts to our system, exploring a range of pulse families,\\nincluding those with super-Gaussian envelopes and polynomial detuning\\nfunctions. We identify Pareto fronts for pulse models constructed from one of\\ntwo envelope functions paired with one of four detuning functions. We then\\nanalyze how each Pareto-optimal pulse parameter influences the two Pareto\\nobjectives and amplitude robustness.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T12:06:56Z\"}"}
