{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11296v1\", \"title\": \"Random matrix ensembles and integrable differential identities\", \"summary\": \"Integrable differential identities, together with ensemble-specific initial\\nconditions, provide an effective approach for the characterisation of relevant\\nobservables and state functions in random matrix theory. We develop the\\napproach for the unitary and orthogonal ensembles. In particular, we focus on a\\nreduction where the probability measure is induced by a Hamiltonian expressed\\nas a formal series of even interactions. We show that the order parameters for\\nthe unitary ensemble, that is associated with the Volterra lattice, solve the\\nmodified KP equation. The analogous reduction for the orthogonal ensemble,\\nassociated with the Pfaff lattice, leads to a new integrable chain. A key step\\nfor the calculation of order parameters solution for the orthogonal ensemble is\\nthe evaluation of the initial condition by using a map from orthogonal to\\nskew-orthogonal polynomials. The thermodynamic limit leads to an integrable\\nsystem (a chain for the orthogonal ensemble) of hydrodynamic type.\\nIntriguingly, we find that the solution to the initial value problem for both\\nthe discrete system and its continuum limit are given by the very same\\nsemi-discrete dynamical chain.\", \"main_category\": \"math-ph\", \"categories\": \"math-ph,math.MP,nlin.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:35:19Z\"}"}
