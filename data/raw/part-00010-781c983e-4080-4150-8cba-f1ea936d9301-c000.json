In the theory of cryptology, the Shannon impossibility theorem\\nstates that the upper bound of the security of a plaintext against a\\nciphertext-only attack is the entropy of the secret key. At the same time, it\\ngives the upper bound of the unicity distance against a known plaintext attack.\\nHence the development of a new symmetric key cipher requires finding a way to\\nundo or lift this theorem. Such challenges have been attempted with quantum\\nstream cipher and quantum data locking as block cipher. Both ciphers are\\ndesigned by means of differentiating the receiving performance of Bob with key\\nand Eve without key according to the principle of quantum communication theory.\\nThus, the origin of security of both ciphers come from the principle of keyed\\ncommunication in quantum noise (KCQ) proposed by Yuen. In this paper, we\\nexplain and compare the principles and features of both cipher and assist to\\nimprove the quantum data locking scheme. Then we will introduce experimental\\nresearch on quantum stream cipher towards commercialization, which has\\nperformance superior to conventional cipher.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T04:28:17Z\"}"}
