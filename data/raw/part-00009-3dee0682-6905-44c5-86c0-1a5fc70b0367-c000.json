{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00297v1\", \"title\": \"A Low-Noise and High-Stability DC Source for Superconducting Quantum\\n  Circuits\", \"summary\": \"With the rapid scaling of superconducting quantum processors, electronic\\ncontrol systems relying on commercial off-the-shelf instruments face critical\\nbottlenecks in signal density, power consumption, and crosstalk mitigation.\\nHere we present a custom dual-channel direct current (DC) source module\\n(QPower) dedicated for large-scale superconducting quantum processors. The\\nmodule delivers a voltage range of $\\\\pm$7 V with 200 mA maximum current per\\nchannel, while achieving the following key performance benchmarks: noise\\nspectral density of 20 nV/$\\\\sqrt{\\\\mathrm{Hz}}$ at 10 kHz, output ripple $<$500\\n$\\\\mu$V$_{\\\\mathrm{pp}}$ within 20 MHz bandwidth, and long-term voltage drift\\n$<$5 $\\\\mu$V$_{\\\\mathrm{pp}}$ over 12 hours. Integrated into the control\\nelectronics of a 66-qubit quantum processor, QPower enables qubit coherence\\ntimes of $T_1 = 87.6~\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{s}$ and Ramsey $T_2 = 5.1~\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{s}$, with\\nqubit resonance frequency drift constrained to $\\\\pm$40 kHz during 12-hour\\noperation. This modular design is compact in size and efficient in energy\\nconsumption, providing a scalable DC source solution for intermediate-scale\\nquantum processors with stringent noise and stability requirements, with\\npotential extensions to other quantum hardware platforms and precision\\nmeasurement.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T04:39:00Z\"}"}
