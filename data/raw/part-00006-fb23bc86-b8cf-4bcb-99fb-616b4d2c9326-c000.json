{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16663v1\", \"title\": \"Online and feasible presentability: from trees to modal algebras\", \"summary\": \"We investigate whether every computable member of a given class of structures\\nadmits a fully primitive recursive (also known as punctual) or fully P-TIME\\ncopy. A class with this property is referred to as punctually robust or P-TIME\\nrobust, respectively. We present both positive and negative results for\\nstructures corresponding to well-known representations of trees, such as binary\\ntrees, ordered trees, sequential (or prefix) trees, and partially ordered\\n(poset) trees. A corollary of one of our results on trees is that semilattices\\nand lattices are not punctually robust. In the main result of the paper, we\\ndemonstrate that, unlike Boolean algebras, modal algebras - that is, Boolean\\nalgebras with modality - are not punctually robust. The question of whether\\ndistributive lattices are punctually robust remains open. The paper contributes\\nto a decades-old program on effective and feasible algebra, which has recently\\ngained momentum due to rapid developments in punctual structure theory and its\\nconnections to online presentations of structures.\", \"main_category\": \"math.LO\", \"categories\": \"math.LO,cs.CC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T12:31:44Z\"}"}
