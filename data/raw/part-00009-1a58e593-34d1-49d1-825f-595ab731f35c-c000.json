However, failures in actuators such as reaction wheels are detrimental\\nand can often lead to an early end of mission. We propose a Lyapunov-based\\nadaptive controller that can estimate and compensate for reaction wheels\\ndegradation simultaneously. The controller incorporates an adaptive update\\ncontrol law with a gradient-based term and an integral concurrent learning term\\nthat collects input-output data for online estimation of uncertain parameters.\\nThe proposed controller guarantees attitude tracking and its performance is\\ntested through numerical simulations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T14:36:51Z\"}"}
