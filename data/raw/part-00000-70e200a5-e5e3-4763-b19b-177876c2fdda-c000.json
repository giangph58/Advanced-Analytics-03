{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19964v1\", \"title\": \"XMM-Newton Observations of the High Temperature Plasma in the Large\\n  Magellanic Cloud Supernova Remnant N132D\", \"summary\": \"We present an analysis of the archival XMM-Newton observations of the Large\\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC) supernova remnant N132D totaling more than 500ks. We\\nfocus on the high temperature plasma ($kt\\\\sim 4.5$keV) that is responsible for\\nthe high energy continuum and exciting the Fe K emission. An image analysis\\nshows that the Fe K emission is mainly concentrated in the southern part of the\\nremnant interior to the region defined by the forward shock. This Fe K\\ndistribution would be consistent with an asymmetric distribution of the Fe\\nejecta and/or an asymmetric interaction between the reverse shock and the Fe\\nejecta. We compare the EPIC-pn and EPIC-MOS spectra in the 3.0 -- 12.0keV\\nbandpass with a model based on RGS data plus a higher temperature component, in\\ncollisional ionization equilibrium (CIE), or non-equilibrium (NEI) (both\\nionizing and recombining). We find that the data are equally well-fitted by the\\nCIE and ionizing models. Assuming the CIE and ionizing spectral models, the Fe\\nin this high temperature component is significantly enhanced with respect to\\ntypical LMC abundances. We can place only an upper limit on the neutral Fe K\\nline. We conclude that the Fe~K emission is due to ejecta heated by the reverse\\nshock given the spatial distribution, relatively high temperature, and enhanced\\nabundance. We estimate the progenitor mass based on the Ca/Fe and Ni/Fe mass\\nratios to be $13\\\\le M_P \\\\le 15 M_\\\\odot$.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:36:27Z\"}"}
