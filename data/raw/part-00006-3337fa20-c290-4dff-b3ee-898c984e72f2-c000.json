In this paper,\\nneural operator models, including Fourier neural operator (FNO), U-net combined\\nFNO (U-FNO) and Deep operator network (DeepONet) are used to approximate the\\ndynamic hysteresis models of GO steel. Furthermore, two types of data\\naugmentation strategies including cyclic rolling augmentation and Gaussian data\\naugmentation (GDA) are implemented to enhance the learning ability of models.\\nWith the inclusion of these augmentation techniques, the optimized models\\naccount for not only the peak values of the magnetic flux density but also the\\neffects of different frequencies and phase shifts. The accuracy of all models\\nis assessed using the L2-norm of the test data and the mean relative error\\n(MRE) of calculated core losses. Each model performs well in different\\nscenarios, but FNO consistently achieves the best performance across all cases.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cs.SY,physics.data-an\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T09:19:23Z\"}"}
