{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04958v1\", \"title\": \"Enhancing the Dynamic Range of Quantum Sensing via Quantum Circuit\\n  Learning\", \"summary\": \"Quantum metrology is a promising application of quantum technologies,\\nenabling the precise measurement of weak external fields at a local scale. In\\ntypical quantum sensing protocols, a qubit interacts with an external field,\\nand the amplitude of the field is estimated by analyzing the expectation value\\nof a measured observable. Sensitivity can, in principle, be enhanced by\\nincreasing the number of qubits within a fixed volume, thereby maintaining\\nspatial resolution. However, at high qubit densities, inter-qubit interactions\\ninduce complex many-body dynamics, resulting in multiple oscillations in the\\nexpectation value of the observable even for small field amplitudes. This\\nambiguity reduces the dynamic range of the sensing protocol. We propose a\\nmethod to overcome the limitation in quantum metrology by adopting a quantum\\ncircuit learning framework using a parameterized quantum circuit to approximate\\na target function by optimizing the circuit parameters. In our method, after\\nthe qubits interact with the external field, we apply a sequence of\\nparameterized quantum gates and measure a suitable observable. By optimizing\\nthe gate parameters, the expectation value is trained to exhibit a monotonic\\nresponse within a target range of field amplitudes, thereby eliminating\\nmultiple oscillations and enhancing the dynamic range. This method offers a\\nstrategy for improving quantum sensing performance in dense qubit systems.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.mes-hall,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T05:40:26Z\"}"}
