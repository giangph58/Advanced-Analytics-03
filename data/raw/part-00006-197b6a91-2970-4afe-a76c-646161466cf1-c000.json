{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01893v1\", \"title\": \"A minimal Pati-Salam theory: from cosmic defects to gravitational waves\\n  and colliders\", \"summary\": \"We discuss a minimal renormalizable Pati-Salam theory based on the\\n$SU(4)_{\\\\rm C}\\\\,\\\\times\\\\,SU(2)_{\\\\rm L}\\\\,\\\\times\\\\,SU(2)_{\\\\rm R}$ gauge group, with\\nunification scale Higgs multiplets taken as $SU(2)_{\\\\rm L}$ and $SU(2)_{\\\\rm R}$\\ndoublets, which lead to neutrino Dirac picture. Although a number of scalar\\nparticles could be light, even lying at the LHC energies, the unification scale\\nis hopelessly out of reach in any foreseeable future. Moreover, phase\\ntransition in the early Universe leads to the production of magnetic monopoles\\nand domain walls, both incompatible with the standard cosmological model. A\\nsmall explicit breaking of the discrete left-right symmetry allows the domain\\nwalls to decay, and in the process possibly sweep away the monopoles,\\nanalogously to the previously discussed case of $SU(5)$ grand unified theory.\\nThis leaves an important imprint of gravitational waves, within the reach of\\nnext generation searches, correlated with monopole detection and new light\\nparticles at collider energies. The theory has a dark matter candidate in the\\nform of an inert scalar doublet, with a mass below TeV, which can further\\ntrigger electroweak baryogenesis.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,astro-ph.CO,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T16:53:52Z\"}"}
