Apart from the\\nnon-thermal nature of the spectra in a majority of GRBs, there is evidence for\\nthe presence of quasi-thermal components in the prompt emission of a few GRBs\\naccording to observations by Fermi satellite. On the other hand, the GRB jet\\nhas been revealed as structured in recent research. The theoretical observed\\nspectra of photosphere emissions by an off-axis observer and the dependence of\\nthe spectra on the viewing angle under the assumption of structured jets remain\\nunexplored. In this paper, we numerically calculate the instantaneous\\nphotosphere spectra by different viewing angles from a structured jet, from\\nwhich relevant temporal and spectral characteristics are derived. Moreover, we\\naddress the necessity of proper treatment of the outflow boundary in the\\nphotosphere emission scenario. Furthermore, our calculations suggest that the\\nEinstein Probe and Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Object Monitor\\nwill have the capability to detect the short GRBs similar to GRB 170817A up to\\na luminosity distance of 200Mpc if the off-axis viewing angle is less than 10\\ndegrees.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T10:24:51Z\"}"}
