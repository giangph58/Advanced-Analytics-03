{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20839v1\", \"title\": \"Universal language model with the intervention of quantum theory\", \"summary\": \"This paper examines language modeling based on the theory of quantum\\nmechanics. It focuses on the introduction of quantum mechanics into the\\nsymbol-meaning pairs of language in order to build a representation model of\\nnatural language. At the same time, it is realized that word embedding, which\\nis widely used as a basic technique for statistical language modeling, can be\\nexplained and improved by the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics. On\\nthis basis, this paper continues to try to use quantum statistics and other\\nrelated theories to study the mathematical representation, natural evolution\\nand statistical properties of natural language. It is also assumed that the\\nsource of such quantum properties is the physicality of information. The\\nfeasibility of using quantum theory to model natural language is pointed out\\nthrough the construction of a experimental code. The paper discusses, in terms\\nof applications, the possible help of the theory in constructing generative\\nmodels that are popular nowadays. A preliminary discussion of future\\napplications of the theory to quantum computers is also presented.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T15:02:30Z\"}"}
