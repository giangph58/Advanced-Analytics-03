Specifically, we\\nexploit the RSMA structure by interleaving the common bits of each user based\\non a sequence derived from their private bits. By decoding its private stream,\\nthe legitimate receiver reconstructs the interleaving sequence set by the\\ntransmitter and successfully de-interleaves the common stream. Therefore, the\\ncommon part is successfully prevented from being intercepted by an eavesdropper\\nwho is unable to deduce the dynamic changing interleaving permutations. To\\nensure dynamic interleaving sequences, a private bit selection approach that\\nbalances the trade-off between security and system efficiency is proposed.\\nSimulation findings confirm the effectiveness of the suggested method, showing\\nnotable security improvements while maintaining robust overall system\\nreliability.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T08:59:10Z\"}"}
