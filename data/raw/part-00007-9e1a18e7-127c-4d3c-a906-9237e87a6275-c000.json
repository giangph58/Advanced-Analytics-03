With this\\nsimple method, statements that were previously derived with approaches using\\nMalliavin calculus or difference operators can be recovered and extended to\\ninclude regularity properties with respect to the time variable. For example,\\nwe derive the H\\\\\\\"older continuity and joint continuity of local densities in\\nthe case of drift coefficients that are locally piecewise H\\\\\\\"older continuous.\\nTo this end, we derive fairly general bounds for the Fourier transform of the\\nlocal density of a solution of the SDE when the drift is locally bounded and\\nthe diffusion is locally sufficiently regular.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T11:09:49Z\"}"}
