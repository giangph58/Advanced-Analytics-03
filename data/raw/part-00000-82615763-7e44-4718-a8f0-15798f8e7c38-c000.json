{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10371v1\", \"title\": \"Brain-Machine Interfaces & Information Retrieval Challenges and\\n  Opportunities\", \"summary\": \"The fundamental goal of Information Retrieval (IR) systems lies in their\\ncapacity to effectively satisfy human information needs - a challenge that\\nencompasses not just the technical delivery of information, but the nuanced\\nunderstanding of human cognition during information seeking. Contemporary IR\\nplatforms rely primarily on observable interaction signals, creating a\\nfundamental gap between system capabilities and users' cognitive processes.\\nBrain-Machine Interface (BMI) technologies now offer unprecedented potential to\\nbridge this gap through direct measurement of previously inaccessible aspects\\nof information-seeking behaviour. This perspective paper offers a broad\\nexamination of the IR landscape, providing a comprehensive analysis of how BMI\\ntechnology could transform IR systems, drawing from advances at the\\nintersection of both neuroscience and IR research. We present our analysis\\nthrough three identified fundamental vertices: (1) understanding the neural\\ncorrelates of core IR concepts to advance theoretical models of search\\nbehaviour, (2) enhancing existing IR systems through contextual integration of\\nneurophysiological signals, and (3) developing proactive IR capabilities\\nthrough direct neurophysiological measurement. For each vertex, we identify\\nspecific research opportunities and propose concrete directions for developing\\nBMI-enhanced IR systems. We conclude by examining critical technical and\\nethical challenges in implementing these advances, providing a structured\\nroadmap for future research at the intersection of neuroscience and IR.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:18:30Z\"}"}
