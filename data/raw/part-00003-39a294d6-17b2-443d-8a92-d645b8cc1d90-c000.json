The\\nmethod of evaluation of quantities $\\\\sigma_n=\\\\sqrt{E_n^*E_n}$ known as the\\nsingular values of $H$ is proposed. Its basic idea is that the quantities\\n$\\\\sigma_n$ can be treated as square roots of eigenvalues of a certain auxiliary\\nself-adjoint operator $\\\\mathbb{H}$. As long as such an operator can be given a\\nblock-tridiagonal matrix form, we construct its resolvent as a matrix continued\\nfraction. In an illustrative application of the formalism, a discrete version\\nof conventional Hamiltonian $H=-d^2/dx^2+V(x)$ with complex local $V(x) \\\\neq\\nV^*(x)$ is considered. The numerical convergence of the recipe is found quick,\\nsupported also by a fixed-point-based formal proof.\", \"main_category\": \"math-ph\", \"categories\": \"math-ph,math.MP,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T05:23:07Z\"}"}
