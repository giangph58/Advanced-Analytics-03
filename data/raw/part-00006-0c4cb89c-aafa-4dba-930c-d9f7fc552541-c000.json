{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04933v1\", \"title\": \"Massive MIMO-OFDM Channel Acquisition with Time-Frequency Phase-Shifted\\n  Pilots\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we propose a channel acquisition approach with time-frequency\\nphase-shifted pilots (TFPSPs) for massive multi-input multi-output orthogonal\\nfrequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. We first present a\\ntriple-beam (TB) based channel tensor model, allowing for the representation of\\nthe space-frequency-time (SFT) domain channel as the product of beam matrices\\nand the TB domain channel tensor. By leveraging the specific characteristics of\\nTB domain channels, we develop TFPSPs, where distinct pilot signals are\\nsimultaneously transmitted in the frequency and time domains. Then, we present\\nthe optimal TFPSP design and provide the corresponding pilot scheduling\\nalgorithm. Further, we propose a tensor-based information geometry approach\\n(IGA) to estimate the TB domain channel tensors. Leveraging the specific\\nstructure of beam matrices and the properties of TFPSPs, we propose a\\nlow-complexity implementation of the tensor-based IGA. We validate the\\nefficiency of our proposed channel acquisition approach through extensive\\nsimulations. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our\\napproach. The proposed approach can effectively suppress inter-UT interference\\nwith low complexity and limited pilot overhead, thereby enhancing channel\\nestimation performance. Particularly in scenarios with a large number of UTs,\\nthe channel acquisition method outperforms existing approaches by reducing the\\nnormalized mean square error (NMSE) by more than 8 dB.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,eess.SP,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T04:24:21Z\"}"}
