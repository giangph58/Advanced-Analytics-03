Near the Franck-Condon regime, DEA is dominated by\\nmolecular shape resonances, where transient OCS$^-$ states form with high\\nvibrational amplitudes, spectroscopically evident as broad features in DEA\\ncross-sections. As the electron beam energy increases from 5.5 to 6.0 eV, S$^-$\\npopulation shifts from lower to higher-energy highly dense bending vibrational\\nstates, reinforcing our findings on dipole-forbidden vibronic intensity\\nborrowing. Our advanced potential energy curve calculations, employing the\\nEquation-of-motion coupled cluster singles and doubles for electron attachment\\n(EA-EOMCCSD) method, reveal that beyond the shape resonance, non-adiabatic\\nresonant tunneling governs the avoided crossings, dynamically generating three\\nmode-specific vibronic Feshbach resonances before complete dissociation into\\nthree distinct kinetic energy bands of S$^-$. Our theoretical results probe\\nmost of the experimental observations quantitatively and qualitatively. These\\ninsights deepen our fundamental understanding of resonance-mediated\\ndissociation in electron-molecule resonant scattering, with broader\\nimplications for quantum mechanics, plasma physics, vibrational revival,\\nastrochemistry, and radiation damage research.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atm-clus\", \"categories\": \"physics.atm-clus,physics.chem-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T13:58:23Z\"}"}
