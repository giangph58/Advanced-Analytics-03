{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10008v1\", \"title\": \"Time for Timed Monitorability\", \"summary\": \"Monitoring is an important part of the verification toolbox, in particular in\\nsituations where exhaustive verification using, e.g., model-checking, is\\ninfeasible. The goal of online monitoring is to determine the satisfaction or\\nviolation of a specification during runtime, i.e., based on finite execution\\nprefixes. However, not every specification is amenable to monitoring, e.g.,\\nproperties for which no finite execution can witness satisfaction or violation.\\nMonitorability is the question whether a given specification is amenable to\\nmonitoring, and has been extensively studied in discrete time.\\n  Here, we study, for the first time, the monitorability problem for real-time\\nspecifications. For specifications given by deterministic Timed Muller\\nAutomata, we prove decidability while we show that the problem is undecidable\\nfor specifications given by nondeterministic Timed B\\\\\\\"uchi automata.\\nFurthermore, we refine monitorability to also determine bounds on the number of\\nevents as well as the time that must pass before monitoring the property may\\nyield an informative verdict. We prove that for deterministic Timed Muller\\nautomata, such bounds can be effectively computed. In contrast we show that for\\nnondeterministic Timed B\\\\\\\"uchi automata such bounds are not computable.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.FL\", \"categories\": \"cs.FL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:12:58Z\"}"}
