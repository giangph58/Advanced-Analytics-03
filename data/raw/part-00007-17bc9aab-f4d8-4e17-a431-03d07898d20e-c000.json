{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17771v1\", \"title\": \"Integrating Learning-Based Manipulation and Physics-Based Locomotion for\\n  Whole-Body Badminton Robot Control\", \"summary\": \"Learning-based methods, such as imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement\\nlearning (RL), can produce excel control policies over challenging agile robot\\ntasks, such as sports robot. However, no existing work has harmonized\\nlearning-based policy with model-based methods to reduce training complexity\\nand ensure the safety and stability for agile badminton robot control. In this\\npaper, we introduce \\\\ourmethod, a novel hybrid control system for agile\\nbadminton robots. Specifically, we propose a model-based strategy for chassis\\nlocomotion which provides a base for arm policy. We introduce a\\nphysics-informed ``IL+RL'' training framework for learning-based arm policy. In\\nthis train framework, a model-based strategy with privileged information is\\nused to guide arm policy training during both IL and RL phases. In addition, we\\ntrain the critic model during IL phase to alleviate the performance drop issue\\nwhen transitioning from IL to RL. We present results on our self-engineered\\nbadminton robot, achieving 94.5% success rate against the serving machine and\\n90.7% success rate against human players. Our system can be easily generalized\\nto other agile mobile manipulation tasks such as agile catching and table\\ntennis.
