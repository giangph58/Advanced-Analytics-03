We investigate fluctuation effects on the\\nrelativistic BEC through numerical analyses for various spatial dimensions and\\nchemical potentials. Our numerical results are consistent with the\\nMermin-Wagner theorem, and this consistency is also analytically confirmed from\\nthe flow equation. We also discuss a numerical instability of the FRG in lower\\nspatial dimensions, which is evadable for certain parameter choices.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,cond-mat.quant-gas,hep-th,G.1.8\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:37:35Z\"}"}
