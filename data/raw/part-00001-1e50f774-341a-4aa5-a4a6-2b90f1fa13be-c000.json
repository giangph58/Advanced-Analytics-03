Our\\nground-state calculations reveal a rich array of interaction- and\\nfilling-dependent phases, including the FCI, Chern insulator, and generalized\\nWigner crystal, etc., explaining recent experimental observations. Moreover, we\\nreveal quantum anomalous Hall crystals exhibiting integer Hall conductivity at\\nfractional moir\\\\'e unit cell fillings, which opens new avenues for experimental\\nexploration in tMoTe$_2$. In the FCI phase, dynamical simulations reveal a\\nsingle-particle continuum with a finite charge gap, indicating the presence of\\nfractional charge excitations. Moreover, our finite-temperature calculations\\ndetermine the characteristic temperatures for charge activation and\\nferromagnetic (FM) transitions, consistent with experiments. We find that the\\ncharge gap is significantly larger than the energy scales of both thermal\\nactivation and FM transitions, explaining recent experimental observations.\\nOverall, by integrating ground-state, finite-temperature, and dynamical\\ntensor-network calculations on the real-space model, we establish a theoretical\\nframework for understanding and exploring correlated topological phases in\\ntMoTe$_2$ and related systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:47:23Z\"}"}
