The integration of massive\\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology is being actively explored to\\nenhance the performance of LEO satellite communications. However, the limited\\npower of LEO satellites poses a significant challenge in improving\\ncommunication energy efficiency (EE) under constrained power conditions.\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) methods are increasingly recognized as promising\\nsolutions for optimizing energy consumption while enhancing system performance,\\nthus enabling more efficient and sustainable communications. This paper\\nproposes approaches to address the challenges associated with precoding in\\nmassive MIMO LEO satellite communications. First, we introduce an end-to-end\\ngraph neural network (GNN) framework that effectively reduces the computational\\ncomplexity of traditional precoding methods. Next, we introduce a deep\\nunfolding of the Dinkelbach algorithm and the weighted minimum mean square\\nerror (WMMSE) approach to achieve enhanced EE, transforming iterative\\noptimization processes into a structured neural network, thereby improving\\nconvergence speed and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we incorporate the\\nTaylor expansion method to approximate matrix inversion within the GNN,\\nenhancing both the interpretability and performance of the proposed method.\\nNumerical experiments demonstrate the validity of our proposed method in terms\\nof complexity and robustness, achieving significant improvements over\\nstate-of-the-art methods.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP,cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:43:15Z\"}"}
