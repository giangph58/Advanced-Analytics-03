Using ultrafast imaging technique,\\nwe show experimentally that a femtosecond laser pulse with a gradient\\ndistribution of intensity efficiently excites strongly inhomogeneous spin\\ndynamics on spatial scales much smaller than the pump spot size. The mechanism\\nresponsible for the inhomogeneous distribution is based on temperature\\ngradients and corresponds to a sign change of the torque derivative in\\ndifferent areas of the pump. We argue that the observed phenomenon is general\\nfor the systems with competitive magnetic anisotropies. Overlooking this effect\\nin the majority of pump-probe experiments may result in a dramatic\\nunderestimation of the live time and amplitude of the laser-induced spin\\ndynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T08:23:54Z\"}"}
