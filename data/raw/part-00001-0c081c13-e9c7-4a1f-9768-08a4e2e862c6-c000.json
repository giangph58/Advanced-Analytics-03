The Majorana nature of heavy neutrinos can induce\\nthe processes $pp \\\\to W_R^\\\\pm \\\\to \\\\ell_\\\\alpha^\\\\pm N \\\\to \\\\ell_\\\\alpha^\\\\pm\\n\\\\ell_\\\\beta^{\\\\mp,\\\\,\\\\pm} jj$, with opposite-sign (OS) and same-sign (SS) dilepton\\nand two jets in the final state. The distributions of the charged leptons $\\\\ell\\n= e ,\\\\, \\\\mu$ and jets and their correlations are utilized as input for machine\\nlearning analysis. It is found that for both the OS and SS processes, XGBoost\\ncan efficiently distinguish signals from the standard model backgrounds. We\\nestimate the sensitivities of heavy neutrino mass $m_N$ and their mixing in the\\nOS and SS $ee$, $\\\\mu\\\\mu$ and $e\\\\mu$ final states at $\\\\sqrt{s} = 14$ TeV, 27 TeV\\nand 100 TeV. It turns out that the heavy neutrinos can be probed up to 17.1 TeV\\nand 19.5 TeV in the OS and SS channels, respectively. The sine of the mixing\\nangle of heavy neutrinos can be probed up to the maximal value of $\\\\sqrt2/2$\\nand 0.69 in the OS and SS channels, respectively.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T14:52:57Z\"}"}
