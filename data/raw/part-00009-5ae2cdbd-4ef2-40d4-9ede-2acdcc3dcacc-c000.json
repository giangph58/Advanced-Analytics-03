While mobile augmented\\nreality (AR) offers a promising alternative with its portability and familiar\\ninteraction gestures, existing solutions limit collaboration to users in the\\nsame physical space. We developed HybridCollab, the first iOS AR application\\nthat introduces a novel paradigm that enables both in-person and remote medical\\nteams to interact with a shared AR heart model in a single surgical planning\\nsession. For example, a team of two doctors in one hospital room can\\ncollaborate in real time with another team in a different hospital.Our approach\\nis the first to leverage Apple's GameKit service for surgical planning,\\nensuring an identical collaborative experience for all participants, regardless\\nof location. Additionally, co-located users can interact with the same anchored\\nheart model in their shared physical space. By bridging the gap between remote\\nand in-person collaboration across medical teams, HybridCollab has the\\npotential for significant real-world impact, streamlining communication and\\nenhancing the effectiveness of surgical planning.
