This approach can correct the\\nmisapplication of shadow radius constraints in some previous studies.\\nSubsequently, we selected two regular Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) black hole\\nsolutions as a representative example to test the $d$-dimensional shadow\\nconstraint formula. Our analysis reveals that the characteristic parameters\\nwithin these $d$-dimensional black hole solutions maintain physically\\nmeaningful bounded domains under shadow radius constraints. We further propose\\nthat this $d$-dimensional shadow constraint formula is universal and can be\\napplied to constrain the characteristic parameters in other high-dimensional\\nspherically symmetric black hole solutions.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T15:08:26Z\"}"}
