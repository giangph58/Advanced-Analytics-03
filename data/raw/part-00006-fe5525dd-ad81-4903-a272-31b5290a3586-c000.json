Using AI-TA, we examined\\nphotochemical changes during femtosecond pump-probe experiments on\\nall-inorganic cesium lead halide nanomaterials, including perovskite\\nnanocrystals (PeNCs) and nanoplatelets (PeNPLs). The laser pulse train\\nfacilitates photoreactions while allowing real-time observation of charge\\ncarrier dynamics. In PeNCs undergoing halide anion photo-substitution,\\ntransient absorption spectra showed increasing bandgap energy and faster\\nrelaxation dynamics as the Cl/Br ratio increased. For colloidal PeNPLs,\\ncontinuous observation revealed both spectral and kinetic changes during the\\nlight-induced coalescence of nanoplatelets, by analyzing temporal segments.\\nThis integrated technique not only deepens understanding of exciton dynamics\\nand environmental influences in perovskite nanomaterials but also establishes\\nAI-TA as a transformative tool for real-time observation of photochemical\\ndynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T07:09:29Z\"}"}
