In recent\\nyears, their study has become increasingly important, as they are present on a\\nwide variety of temporal and spatial scales and can connect several layers of\\nthe solar atmosphere. In this work, we focused on the detection and analysis of\\nthese structures in an automatic way. We use realistic 3D MHD numerical\\nsimulations obtained with the Mancha3D code at different magnetic field\\nconfigurations and spatial resolutions. The vortex detection has been performed\\nusing the novel SWIRL code. We have been able to determine multiple structures\\nassociated with small and large scale vortices that extend in height in our\\nsimulations. We performed a statistical analysis of these structures,\\nquantifying their number and typical sizes, as well as their temperature and\\nheating profiles, confirming their importance in the energy transport.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T16:12:11Z\"}"}
