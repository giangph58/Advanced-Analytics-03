{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00335v1\", \"title\": \"Efficient Neural Video Representation with Temporally Coherent\\n  Modulation\", \"summary\": \"Implicit neural representations (INR) has found successful applications\\nacross diverse domains. To employ INR in real-life, it is important to speed up\\ntraining. In the field of INR for video applications, the state-of-the-art\\napproach employs grid-type parametric encoding and successfully achieves a\\nfaster encoding speed in comparison to its predecessors. However, the grid\\nusage, which does not consider the video's dynamic nature, leads to redundant\\nuse of trainable parameters. As a result, it has significantly lower parameter\\nefficiency and higher bitrate compared to NeRV-style methods that do not use a\\nparametric encoding. To address the problem, we propose Neural Video\\nrepresentation with Temporally coherent Modulation (NVTM), a novel framework\\nthat can capture dynamic characteristics of video. By decomposing the\\nspatio-temporal 3D video data into a set of 2D grids with flow information,\\nNVTM enables learning video representation rapidly and uses parameter\\nefficiently. Our framework enables to process temporally corresponding pixels\\nat once, resulting in the fastest encoding speed for a reasonable video\\nquality, especially when compared to the NeRV-style method, with a speed\\nincrease of over 3 times. Also, it remarks an average of 1.54dB/0.019\\nimprovements in PSNR/LPIPS on UVG (Dynamic) (even with 10% fewer parameters)\\nand an average of 1.84dB/0.013 improvements in PSNR/LPIPS on MCL-JCV (Dynamic),\\ncompared to previous grid-type works. By expanding this to compression tasks,\\nwe demonstrate comparable performance to video compression standards (H.264,\\nHEVC) and recent INR approaches for video compression. Additionally, we perform\\nextensive experiments demonstrating the superior performance of our algorithm\\nacross diverse tasks, encompassing super resolution, frame interpolation and\\nvideo inpainting.
