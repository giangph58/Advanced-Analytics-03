To address this challenge, we introduce an Integrated\\nCommunication and Computing (ICC) framework where computing capabilities are\\nenabled to reside directly in radio access network (RAN) nodes and jointly\\nmanage bandwidth and computing resources. Our queueing-theoretic analysis shows\\nthat ICC outperforms 5G MEC, achieving higher service capacity (defined as the\\nmaximum arrival rate that maintains a specified fraction of jobs completed\\nwithin a given delay budget) by 98%. We corroborate these gains through\\nsystem-level simulations that account for transformer-based LLM workloads,\\nrealistic GPU specifications, and a priority-based scheduling scheme. The\\nsimulations show that ICC improves service capacity by 60%, demonstrating its\\npotential to enable efficient, cost-effective real-time GenAI services in 6G.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T08:54:10Z\"}"}
