Unlike conventional deep learning\\nmodels, which require extensive annotation, ADZUS leverages zero-shot learning\\nto dynamically adapt segmentation based on descriptive prompts, offering\\nenhanced flexibility and adaptability in clinical applications. Experimental\\nevaluations demonstrate that ADZUS surpasses traditional and state-of-the-art\\nsegmentation models, achieving an IoU of 86.68\\\\% and the highest precision of\\n94.69\\\\% on the chronic wound dataset, outperforming supervised approaches such\\nas FUSegNet. Further validation on a custom-curated DFU dataset reinforces its\\nrobustness, with ADZUS achieving a median DSC of 75\\\\%, significantly surpassing\\nFUSegNet's 45\\\\%. The model's text-guided segmentation capability enables\\nreal-time customization of segmentation outputs, allowing targeted analysis of\\nwound characteristics based on clinical descriptions. Despite its competitive\\nperformance, the computational cost of diffusion-based inference and the need\\nfor potential fine-tuning remain areas for future improvement. ADZUS represents\\na transformative step in wound segmentation, providing a scalable, efficient,\\nand adaptable AI-driven solution for medical imaging.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:50:10Z\"}"}
