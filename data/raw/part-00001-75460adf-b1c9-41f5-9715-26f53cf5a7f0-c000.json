{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12993v1\", \"title\": \"New Frontiers in Muon-Spin Spectroscopy Using Si-Pixel Detectors\", \"summary\": \"The study of novel quantum materials relies on muon-spin rotation,\\nrelaxation, or resonance (\\\\mSR) measurements. Yet, a fundamental limitation\\npersists: many of these materials can only be synthesized in extremely small\\nquantities, often at sub-millimeter scales. While \\\\mSR ~offers unique insights\\ninto electronic and magnetic properties, existing spectrometers lack a\\nsub-millimeter spatial resolution and the possibility of triggerless pump-probe\\ndata acquisition, which would enable more advanced measurements. The General\\nPurpose Surface-muon instrument (GPS) at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) is\\ncurrently limited to a muon stopping rate of \\\\SI{40}{\\\\kilo\\\\hertz} to\\n\\\\SI{120}{\\\\kilo\\\\hertz}, a constraint that will become more pressing with the\\nupcoming High-Intensity Muon Beam (HIMB) project. To overcome these challenges,\\nwe demonstrate the feasibility of employing ultra-thin monolithic Si-pixel\\ndetectors to reconstruct the stopping position of muons within the sample,\\nthereby significantly enhancing the capability of measuring at higher muon\\nrate. Additionally, we explore the first steps toward a triggerless pump-probe\\n\\\\mSR ~measurement scheme. Unlike conventional pump-probe techniques that\\nrequire external triggers, a triggerless readout system can continuously\\nintegrate stimuli pulses into the data stream, allowing real-time tracking of\\nultra-fast dynamics in quantum materials. This approach will enable the study\\nof transient states, spin dynamics, and quantum coherence under external\\nstimuli.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T15:02:36Z\"}"}
