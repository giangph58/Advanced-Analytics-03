{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17716v1\", \"title\": \"Online metric TSP\", \"summary\": \"In the online metric traveling salesperson problem, $n$ points of a metric\\nspace arrive one by one and have to be placed (immediately and irrevocably)\\ninto empty cells of a size-$n$ array. The goal is to minimize the sum of\\ndistances between consecutive points in the array. This problem was introduced\\nby Abrahamsen, Bercea, Beretta, Klausen, and Kozma [ESA'24] as a generalization\\nof the online sorting problem, which was introduced by Aamand, Abrahamsen,\\nBeretta, and Kleist [SODA'23] as a tool in their study of online geometric\\npacking problems.\\n  Online metric TSP has been studied for a range of fixed metric spaces. For\\n1-dimensional Euclidean space, the problem is equivalent to online sorting,\\nwhere an optimal competitive ratio of $\\\\Theta(\\\\sqrt n)$ is known. For\\n$d$-dimensional Euclidean space, the best-known upper bound is $O(2^{d}\\n\\\\sqrt{dn\\\\log n})$, leaving a gap to the $\\\\Omega(\\\\sqrt n)$ lower bound. Finally,\\nfor the uniform metric, where all distances are 0 or 1, the optimal competitive\\nratio is known to be $\\\\Theta(\\\\log n)$.\\n  We study the problem for a general metric space, presenting an algorithm with\\ncompetitive ratio $O(\\\\sqrt n)$. In particular, we close the gap for\\n$d$-dimensional Euclidean space, completely removing the dependence on\\ndimension. One might hope to simultaneously guarantee competitive ratio\\n$O(\\\\sqrt n)$ in general and $O(\\\\log n)$ for the uniform metric, but we show\\nthat this is impossible.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T16:17:57Z\"}"}
