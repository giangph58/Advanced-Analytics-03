The problem of the previously proposed approaches written\\nin terms of inter-atomic Green's functions is the presence of a spatial sum\\nover all atoms of the crystal, which greatly complicates their application to\\nsystems with itinerant electrons. To provide a solution we derived expressions\\nfor magnetic torque vector and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions based on\\n$\\\\bf{k}$-dependent Green's functions, which allow numerical evaluations with\\nguaranteed stability of spatial sums over the crystal lattice and moreover with\\nmuch lower computational cost. Approbation of the approaches on the case of\\nFe$_3$GeTe$_2$ monolayer, which is based on first-principles DFT calculations,\\nconfirmed the numerical stability and allowed us to reproduce the\\ncharacteristic length of experimentally observed collective spin excitations in\\nthe domain structure of this promising conducting material.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T06:31:18Z\"}"}
