Aim: Our research aim to explore the processes and\\nassociated challenges with requirements activities that include client-supplier\\ninteraction and communication. Method: we study requirements validation,\\ncommunication, and digital asset verification processes through two case\\nstudies in the road and railway sectors, involving interviews with ten experts\\nacross three companies. Results: We identify 13 challenges, along with their\\ncauses and consequences, and suggest solution areas from existing literature.\\nConclusion: Interestingly, the challenges in infrastructure projects mirror\\nthose found in software engineering, highlighting a need for further research\\nto validate potential solutions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T07:52:08Z\"}"}
