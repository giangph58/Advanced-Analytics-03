{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10313v1\", \"title\": \"An Empirical Evaluation of White-box and Black-box Test Case\\n  Prioritization Techniques in CPSs Modeled in Simulink\", \"summary\": \"MATLAB/Simulink is the leading tool for simulating complex Cyber-Physical\\nSystems (CPSs). The simulation models of complex CPSs are typically compute\\nintensive, and the execution of test cases is long. Furthermore, the execution\\nof test cases is typically triggered several times at different ``in-the-Loop''\\ntest levels (i.e., Model, Software and Hardware-in-the-Loop). Therefore, test\\noptimization techniques, such as test case prioritization, are paramount when\\ntesting these systems. In this paper, we present the largest empirical study on\\ntest case prioritization techniques for Simulink models by comparing the\\nperformance of white-box and black-box test case prioritization techniques. We\\nassess traditional test case prioritization techniques, and we also propose new\\napproaches for use in the context of Simulink models. We empirically compared\\n11 test case prioritization techniques using six Simulink models of different\\nsizes and complexities. When comparing white-box against black-box test case\\nprioritization techniques, we found that in general, white-box techniques were\\nslightly better than black-box ones. In the context of white-box test case\\nprioritization, the total greedy approach performed better than the additional\\ngreedy techniques in larger models. As for the test case prioritization time,\\nblack-box techniques were faster, although total greedy techniques were fast\\nenough to be used in practice.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T15:22:12Z\"}"}
