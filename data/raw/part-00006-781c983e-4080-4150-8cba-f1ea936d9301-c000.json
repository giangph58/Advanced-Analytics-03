Moreover, it is shown that this single-letter characterization can be\\nexplicitly evaluated for the Gaussian source. Various notions of universal\\nrepresentation are also clarified.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,cs.LG,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T04:13:56Z\"}"}
