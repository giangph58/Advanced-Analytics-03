Specifically, we validate the\\n3GPP TR 38.901 path loss model for the InH scenario in both line of sight (LOS)\\nand non line of sight (NLOS) channel conditions, using the floating intercept\\n(FI) and alpha-beta-gamma (ABG) path loss models. The validation focuses on\\nspecific frequencies, including 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz, as well as the broader\\n7-24 GHz and 0.5-100 GHz frequency ranges. The validation is based on\\nreal-world measurements conducted at 6.75 GHz, 16.95 GHz, 28 GHz, and 73 GHz by\\nNYU WIRELESS using a 1 GHz wideband time domain based sliding correlation\\nchannel sounder in the InH scenario for both LOS and NLOS channel conditions.\\nOur results confirm that the 3GPP TR 38.901 path loss model for the InH\\nscenario remains valid for the 7-24 GHz range in both LOS and NLOS conditions\\nand provide valuable input for 6G standardization efforts.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T05:08:09Z\"}"}
