{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19496v1\", \"title\": \"DISCO: learning to DISCover an evolution Operator for\\n  multi-physics-agnostic prediction\", \"summary\": \"We address the problem of predicting the next state of a dynamical system\\ngoverned by unknown temporal partial differential equations (PDEs) using only a\\nshort trajectory. While standard transformers provide a natural black-box\\nsolution to this task, the presence of a well-structured evolution operator in\\nthe data suggests a more tailored and efficient approach. Specifically, when\\nthe PDE is fully known, classical numerical solvers can evolve the state\\naccurately with only a few parameters. Building on this observation, we\\nintroduce DISCO, a model that uses a large hypernetwork to process a short\\ntrajectory and generate the parameters of a much smaller operator network,\\nwhich then predicts the next state through time integration. Our framework\\ndecouples dynamics estimation (i.e., DISCovering an evolution operator from a\\nshort trajectory) from state prediction (i.e., evolving this operator).\\nExperiments show that pretraining our model on diverse physics datasets\\nachieves state-of-the-art performance while requiring significantly fewer\\nepochs. Moreover, it generalizes well and remains competitive when fine-tuned\\non downstream tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T05:36:52Z\"}"}
