{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11170v1\", \"title\": \"A Real-time Anomaly Detection Method for Robots based on a Flexible and\\n  Sparse Latent Space\", \"summary\": \"The growing demand for robots to operate effectively in diverse environments\\nnecessitates the need for robust real-time anomaly detection techniques during\\nrobotic operations. However, deep learning-based models in robotics face\\nsignificant challenges due to limited training data and highly noisy signal\\nfeatures. In this paper, we present Sparse Masked Autoregressive Flow-based\\nAdversarial AutoEncoders model to address these problems. This approach\\nintegrates Masked Autoregressive Flow model into Adversarial AutoEncoders to\\nconstruct a flexible latent space and utilize Sparse autoencoder to efficiently\\nfocus on important features, even in scenarios with limited feature space. Our\\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a 4.96% to 9.75%\\nhigher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for\\npick-and-place robotic operations with randomly placed cans, compared to\\nexisting state-of-the-art methods. Notably, it showed up to 19.67% better\\nperformance in scenarios involving collisions with lightweight objects.\\nAdditionally, unlike the existing state-of-the-art model, our model performs\\ninferences within 1 millisecond, ensuring real-time anomaly detection. These\\ncapabilities make our model highly applicable to machine learning-based robotic\\nsafety systems in dynamic environments. The code will be made publicly\\navailable after acceptance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T13:17:14Z\"}"}
