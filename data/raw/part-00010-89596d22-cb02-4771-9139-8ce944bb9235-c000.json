One impetus driving recent interest in\\nthe effect is its dependence on intrinsic or microscopic symmetry breaking\\nmechanisms.\\n  Here, we study the superconducting diode effect in gated planar Josephson\\njunctions fabricated on a superconductor--semiconductor heterostructure under\\nan in-plane magnetic field.\\n  We observe two gate-driven inversions of the diode polarity in the vicinity\\nof zero field, as well as a third-harmonic component in the dependence of the\\ndiode efficiency on the in-plane field angle.\\n  We analyze the Lifshitz invariant for an arbitrary spin--orbit coupling and\\nshow that multiple polarity inversions are possible in the presence of both\\nlinear and cubic Dresselhaus terms, where the Rashba parameter varies\\nmonotonically with gate voltage.\\n  Numerical calculations of the diode efficiency further reveal the presence of\\nhigher harmonics in its field-angle dependence in the presence of spin--orbit\\ncoupling.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T09:48:43Z\"}"}
