By paralleling the incoherence matrix completion framework, we show\\nfor the first time that global convergence guarantee with exact recovery of\\nthis routine can be established given $\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\mu^2 r^3 \\\\kappa^2 n \\\\log\\nn)$ Bernoulli random observations without any sample splitting. Unlike\\nleveraging the tangent space Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) and local\\ncurvature of the low-rank embedding manifold in some very recent works, our\\nproof provides new upper bounds to replace the random graph lemma under EDMC\\nsetting. The APGD works surprisingly well and numerical experiments demonstrate\\nexact linear convergence behavior in rich-sample regions yet deteriorates fast\\nwhen compared with the performance obtained by optimizing the s-stress\\nfunction, i.e., the standard but unexplained non-convex approach for EDMC, if\\nthe sample size is limited. While virtually matching our theoretical\\nprediction, this unusual phenomenon might indicate that: (i) the power of\\nimplicit regularization is weakened when specified in the APGD case; (ii) the\\nstabilization of such new gradient direction requires substantially more\\nsamples than the information-theoretic limit would suggest.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,eess.SP,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T07:13:23Z\"}"}
