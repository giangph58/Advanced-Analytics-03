This paper concentrates on pose graph\\nconstruction and motion synchronization within multiview registration. Previous\\nmethods for pose graph construction often pruned fully connected graphs or\\nconstructed sparse graph using global feature aggregated from local\\ndescriptors, which may not consistently yield reliable results. To identify\\ndependable pairs for pose graph construction, we design a network model that\\nextracts information from the matching distance between point cloud pairs. For\\nmotion synchronization, we propose another neural network model to calculate\\nthe absolute pose in a data-driven manner, rather than optimizing inaccurate\\nhandcrafted loss functions. Our model takes into account geometric distribution\\ninformation and employs a modified attention mechanism to facilitate flexible\\nand reliable feature interaction. Experimental results on diverse indoor and\\noutdoor datasets confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of our\\napproach.
