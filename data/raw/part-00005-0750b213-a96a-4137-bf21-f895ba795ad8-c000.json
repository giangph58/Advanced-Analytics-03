The enabling\\ncondition of a channel under attacks is formulated with respect to attack flow\\nand channel bandwidth, then a new networked control system model bridging the\\ngap between system dynamics and network deployment is built. Based on this, the\\ncross-layered defense strategy is proposed. It jointly optimizes the controller\\ngain and bandwidth allocation of channels according to the real-time attack\\nflow and system dynamics, by solving a mixed-integer semidefinite programming\\nonline. A smart enumeration algorithm for non-convex bi-level optimization is\\nproposed to analyze the stability under the strategy. Numerical examples are\\ngiven to illustrate the high resilience from the cross-layered feature.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:43:26Z\"}"}
