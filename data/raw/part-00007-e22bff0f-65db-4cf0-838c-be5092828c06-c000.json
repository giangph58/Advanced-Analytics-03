{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17686v1\", \"title\": \"Metal-insulator transitions in pyrochlore oxides\", \"summary\": \"Pyrochlore oxides with chemical formula of A2B2O7 exhibit a diverse range of\\nelectronic properties as a representative family of quantum materials. These\\nproperties mostly stem from strong electron correlations at the transition\\nmetal B site and typical geometrical frustration effects on the pyrochlore\\nlattice. Furthermore, the coupling between the magnetic moments of the\\nrare-earth A site and the conduction electrons at the B site, along with the\\nrelativistic spin-orbit coupling particularly affecting the 4d/5d electrons at\\nthe B site, gives rise to the topological characteristics of the correlated\\nelectrons. This review paper focuses on the metal-insulator transitions in\\npyrochlore oxides as evidence of the strong electron correlation, which is\\nhighlighted as a rich source of intriguing charge dynamics coupled with\\nfrustrated spin-orbital entangled magnetism.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:55:13Z\"}"}
