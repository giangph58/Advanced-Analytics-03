There are so\\nfar only 16 known circumbinary exoplanets, all of which lie in the same orbital\\nplane as the host binary. Suggestions exist that circumbinary planets could\\nalso exist on orbits highly inclined to the binary, close to 90$^{\\\\circ}$,\\npolar orbits. No such planets have been found yet but polar circumbinary gas\\nand debris discs have been observed and if these were to form planets then\\nthose would be left on a polar orbit. We report strong evidence for a polar\\ncircumbinary exoplanet, which orbits a close pair of brown dwarfs which are on\\nan eccentric orbit. We use radial-velocities to measure a retrograde apsidal\\nprecession for the binary, and show that this can only be attributed to the\\npresence of a polar planet.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T15:56:57Z\"}"}
