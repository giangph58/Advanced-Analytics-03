Our calculation is a novel use of analytic\\nreconstruction, retaining explicit covariance in the massive spin states\\nthrough the massive spinor-helicity formalism. The analytic reconstruction\\nrelies on embedding the massive five-point kinematics in a fully massless\\neight-point phase space while still building a minimal ansatz directly in the\\nfive-point phase space. In order to obtain compact analytic expressions it is\\nnecessary to identify suitable partial fraction decompositions and extract\\ncommon numerator factors, which we achieve through careful inspection of limits\\nin which pairs of denominators vanish. We find that the resulting amplitudes\\nare more numerically efficient than ones computed using automatic methods but\\nthat the gains are not as significant as in the massless case, at least at\\npresent. The method opens the door to applications at two-loop order, where\\nnumerical efficiency and improvements in the reconstruction methodology are\\nmore crucial, especially with regards to the number of free parameters in the\\nansatz.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:40:33Z\"}"}
