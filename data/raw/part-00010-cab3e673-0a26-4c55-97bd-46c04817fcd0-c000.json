It has been previously shown by \\\\v{S}pitalsk\\\\'y that there\\nare exact maps on the Gehman dendrite with arbitrarily low positive topological\\nentropy. Together, these results show that the entropy of maps on the Gehman\\ndendrite does not exhibit the paradoxical behaviour reported for graph maps,\\nwhere the infimum of the topological entropy of exact maps is strictly smaller\\nthan the infimum of the entropy of pure mixing maps. The latter result, stated\\nin terms of popular notions of chaos, says that for maps on graphs, lower\\nentropy implies stronger Devaney chaos. The conclusion of this paper says that\\nlower entropy does not force stronger chaos for maps of the Gehman dendrite.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:26:04Z\"}"}
