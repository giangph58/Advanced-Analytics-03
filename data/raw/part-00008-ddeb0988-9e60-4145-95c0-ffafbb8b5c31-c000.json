For instance, Kittur et al. highlight how success expectations are\\nshaped by perceived system fit and course difficulty.\\n  Recent advances in generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) present new\\npossibilities for GenAI-mediated learning. AI-generated instructional messages\\nare often perceived as clearer than human-written content, but their impact on\\nlearners' perceptions of skill-building experiences remains underexplored.\\n  This study examines GenAI-mediated learning in a self-directed context,\\nfocusing on communication skills. We compare three messaging styles -\\nAffective, Cognitive, and Action-Oriented - to investigate their influence on\\nlearners' perceptions of the learning process. We applied this approach to ten\\ninstructional units, using GenAI to generate 30 learning items. Three\\nevaluators assessed them for desirability and appropriateness through numerical\\nratings and open-ended feedback. The 180 excerpts were analyzed using reflexive\\nthematic analysis, revealing four overarching themes: Prerequisite Common\\nGround, Intrinsic Value, User Responses, and Expressed Preferences.\\n  We discuss these insights to inform the design of GenAI-mediated,\\nself-directed skill-building, with the goal of enhancing engagement,\\npersistence, and learning outcomes.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T07:34:39Z\"}"}
