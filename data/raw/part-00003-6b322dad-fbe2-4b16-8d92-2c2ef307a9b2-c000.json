The effects of phonon damping and\\nadsorbent size on the adsorption rate in this quantum regime are studied using\\nthe multimode Rabi model. It is demonstrated that the adsorption rate can be\\neither enhanced or suppressed relative to the Fermi golden rule rate, in\\nanalogy to cavity effects in the spontaneous emission rate in QED. A\\nmesoscopic-sized adsorbent behaves as an acoustic cavity that enhances the\\nadsorption rate when tuned to the adsorption transition frequency and\\nsuppresses the rate when detuned. This acoustic cavity effect occurs in the\\nregime where the frequency spacing between vibrational modes exceeds the phonon\\nlinewidth.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:58:03Z\"}"}
