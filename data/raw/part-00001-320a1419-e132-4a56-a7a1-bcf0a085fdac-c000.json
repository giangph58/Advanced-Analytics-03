{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00585v1\", \"title\": \"Dimension-reduced Optimization of Multi-zone Thermostatically Controlled\\n  Loads\", \"summary\": \"This study proposes a computationally efficient method for optimizing\\nmulti-zone thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) by leveraging\\ndimensionality reduction through an auto-encoder. We develop a multi-task\\nlearning framework to jointly represent latent variables and formulate a\\nstate-space model based on observed TCL operation data. This significantly\\nreduces the dimensionality of TCL variables and states while preserving\\ncritical nonlinear interdependencies in TCL control. To address various\\napplication scenarios, we introduce optimization algorithms based on system\\nidentification (OptIden) and system simulation (OptSim) tailored to the latent\\nvariable representation. These approaches employ automatic differentiation and\\nzeroth-order techniques, respectively, for efficient implementation. We\\nevaluate the proposed method using a 90-zone apartment prototype, comparing its\\nperformance to traditional high-dimensional optimization. Results demonstrate\\nthat our approach effectively reduces control costs while achieving\\nsignificantly higher computational efficiency.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T15:16:04Z\"}"}
