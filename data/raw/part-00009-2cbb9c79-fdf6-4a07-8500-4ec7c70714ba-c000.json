{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17388v1\", \"title\": \"Computing-heightened low-cost high-dimensional controlled-SUM gates\", \"summary\": \"Qudit-based quantum gates offer several advantages over qubit-based\\ncounterparts, such as higher information density, the ability to address more\\ncomplex problems, and richer quantum operations. In this paper, we present\\nthree realistic protocols for implementing a 4$\\\\times$4-dimensional (16D)\\ntwo-qudit controlled-SUM (CSUM) gate, where the 4D control qudit and 4D target\\nqudit are encoded in the polarization degree of freedom (DoF) and spatial DoF\\nof two photons, respectively. The first protocol is implemented exclusively\\nusing linear optical elements without auxiliary resources, making it feasible\\nwith current optical technologies and achieving an efficiency of 1/9. The\\nsecond protocol utilizes photon scattering by a microcavity-quantum-dot system,\\nenabling the 16D CSUM gate to operate deterministically without postselection.\\nThe third protocol introduces an error-heralded mechanism based on the second\\nprotocol, theoretically achieving unity fidelity. Moreover, all protocols\\noperate without ancillary photons, offering the advantages of compact circuits\\nand low cost while further promoting the development of high-dimensional\\nquantum computation.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T09:13:26Z\"}"}
