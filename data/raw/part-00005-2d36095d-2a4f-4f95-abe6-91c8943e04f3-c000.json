{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16810v1\", \"title\": \"Polarity from the Bottom Up: A Computational Framework for Predicting\\n  Spontaneous Polar Order\", \"summary\": \"So-called polar liquid crystals possess spontaneous long-range mutual\\norientation of their electric dipole moments, conferring bulk polarity to fluid\\nphases of matter. The combination of polarity and fluidity leads to complex\\nphase behaviour, and rich new physics, yet the limited understanding around how\\nspecific molecular features generate long-range polar ordering in a fluid is a\\nhindrance to development of new materials. In this work, we introduce a\\ncomputational framework that probes the bimolecular potential energy landscape\\nof candidate molecules, enabling us to dissect the role of directional\\nintermolecular interactions in establishing polar order. In closely related\\nfamilies of materials we find conflicting preferences for (anti)parallel\\nordering which can be accounted for by specific interactions between molecules.\\nThus, our results allow us to argue that the presence (or absence) of polar\\norder is a product of specific molecular features and strong directional\\nintermolecular interactions rather than being simply a product of dipole-dipole\\nforces. The design principles established can be leveraged to developing new\\npolar liquid crystalline materials.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:28:46Z\"}"}
