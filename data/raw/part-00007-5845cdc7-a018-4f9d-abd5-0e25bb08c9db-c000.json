{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04949v1\", \"title\": \"One Quantizer is Enough: Toward a Lightweight Audio Codec\", \"summary\": \"Neural audio codecs have recently gained traction for their ability to\\ncompress high-fidelity audio and generate discrete tokens that can be utilized\\nin downstream generative modeling tasks. However, leading approaches often rely\\non resource-intensive models and multi-quantizer architectures, resulting in\\nconsiderable computational overhead and constrained real-world applicability.\\nIn this paper, we present SQCodec, a lightweight neural audio codec that\\nleverages a single quantizer to address these limitations. SQCodec explores\\nstreamlined convolutional networks and local Transformer modules, alongside\\nTConv, a novel mechanism designed to capture acoustic variations across\\nmultiple temporal scales, thereby enhancing reconstruction fidelity while\\nreducing model complexity. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets show\\nthat SQCodec achieves audio quality comparable to multi-quantizer baselines,\\nwhile its single-quantizer design offers enhanced adaptability and its\\nlightweight architecture reduces resource consumption by an order of magnitude.\\nThe source code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhai-lw/SQCodec.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SD\", \"categories\": \"cs.SD,cs.AI,I.2.m\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:34:39Z\"}"}
