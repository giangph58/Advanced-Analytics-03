{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04478v1\", \"title\": \"Ratchet Hall Effect in Fluctuating Superconductors\", \"summary\": \"We propose a superconducting ratchet-induced Hall effect (RHE), characterized\\nby the emergence of a unidirectional, rectified flux of fluctuating Cooper\\npairs in a two-dimensional thin film exposed to an external electromagnetic\\nfield. The RHE is a second-order response with respect to the electromagnetic\\nfield amplitude. It consists of a nonzero photocurrent due to the breaking of\\nthe system's inversion symmetry driven by the combined action of the in-plane\\ntime-dependent electric field and a spatial modulation of the critical\\ntemperature. We explore a means to control the electric current by the\\npolarization of the external field accompanied by a non-linear Hall effect of\\nfluctuating Cooper pairs caused by circularly polarized irradiation. Moreover,\\nthe nonlinear conductivity tensor exhibits a higher-power dependence on the\\nreduced temperature compared to that of the conventional Aslamazov-Larkin\\ncorrection (or other fluctuating second-order nonlinear responses). It results\\nin a dramatic enhancement of the non-linear Hall response of fluctuating Cooper\\npairs in the vicinity of the superconducting criticality.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:48:38Z\"}"}
