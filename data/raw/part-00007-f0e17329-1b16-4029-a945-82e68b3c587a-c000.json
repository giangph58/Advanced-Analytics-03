Using weak-noise\\nlarge deviation theory, we derive the most probable escape paths and quantify\\ntheir likelihood via the action functional. We compute the feedback-modified\\nKramers rate and its inverse, which approximates the mean escape time, and show\\nthat the feedback accelerates escape by storing finite-time fluctuations\\nthereby lowering the effective energy barrier, and shifting the optimal escape\\ntime from infinite to finite. Although we identify alternative mechanisms, such\\nas slingshot and ballistic escape trajectories, we find that they remain\\nsub-optimal and hence do not accelerate escape. These results show how memory\\nfeedback reshapes rare event statistics, thereby offering a mechanism to\\npotentially control escape dynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T15:04:23Z\"}"}
