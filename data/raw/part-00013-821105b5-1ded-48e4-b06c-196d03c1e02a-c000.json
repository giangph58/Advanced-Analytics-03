{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07743v1\", \"title\": \"Finite-Blocklength Information Theory\", \"summary\": \"Traditional asymptotic information-theoretic studies of the fundamental\\nlimits of wireless communication systems primarily rely on some ideal\\nassumptions, such as infinite blocklength and vanishing error probability.\\nWhile these assumptions enable tractable mathematical characterizations, they\\nfail to capture the stringent requirements of some emerging next-generation\\nwireless applications, such as ultra-reliable low latency communication and\\nultra-massive machine type communication, in which it is required to support a\\nmuch wider range of features including short-packet communication, extremely\\nlow latency, and/or low energy consumption. To better support such\\napplications, it is important to consider finite-blocklength information\\ntheory. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the advances in\\nthis field, followed by a discussion on the open questions. Specifically, we\\ncommence with the fundamental limits of source coding in the non-asymptotic\\nregime, with a particular focus on lossless and lossy compression in\\npoint-to-point~(P2P) and multiterminal cases. Next, we discuss the fundamental\\nlimits of channel coding in P2P channels, multiple access channels, and\\nemerging massive access channels. We further introduce recent advances in joint\\nsource and channel coding, highlighting its considerable performance advantage\\nover separate source and channel coding in the non-asymptotic regime. In each\\npart, we review various non-asymptotic achievability bounds, converse bounds,\\nand approximations, as well as key ideas behind them, which are essential for\\nproviding engineering insights into the design of future wireless communication\\nsystems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T13:39:56Z\"}"}
