Phase identification is based on High\\nResolution Transmission Electron Microscopy and on X-ray emission analysis\\ncoupled with Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy. We propose that\\nPtSn4-ordered domains precipitate inside Sn nanoparticles once the temperature\\ndrops below 520{\\\\deg}C upon collisional cooling with room temperature Argon,\\nwhile the nanoparticles persist longer in a liquid state. Sn matrix eventually\\nsolidifies upon the sudden temperature drop due to the supersonic expansion.\\n2D-layered PtSn4 domains create interparticle heterostructures that disrupt the\\nspherical symmetry typical of gas aggregation processes and separate the Sn\\nparticle into distinct parts. The Dirac nodal arc semimetal character of PtSn4\\nmakes it particularly interesting for studying the transport mechanisms in\\nnanogranular films obtained by the soft-assembling of such nanoparticles, which\\nfeature a network of heterostructures showing sequences of alternate PtSn4 2D\\ndomains and metallic \\\\b{eta}-Sn necks.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:15:30Z\"}"}
