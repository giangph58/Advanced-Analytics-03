{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21316v1\", \"title\": \"Reduced order asymptotic observer of friction in motion control\", \"summary\": \"An asymptotic observer of the motion state variables with nonlinear friction\\n[1] benefits from a robust to the noise state-space representation of the\\ndynamic friction force, including pre-sliding transitions, and implements the\\nreduced order Luenberger observation law with only measurable output\\ndisplacement. The uniform asymptotic stability and convergence analysis of the\\nproposed observer are elaborated by using the Lyapunov function-based stability\\ncriteria by Ignatyev and imposing the parametric constraints on the time\\ndependent eigenvalues to be always negative real. A design procedure for\\nassigning a dominant (thus slowest) real pole of the observer system matrix is\\nproposed. A thorough experimental evaluation is given for the proposed\\nobserver-based friction compensation, which is performed for positioning and\\ntracking tasks and compared with an optimally tuned PID feedback control.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T05:04:48Z\"}"}
