{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03285v1\", \"title\": \"Soft Reasoning Paths for Knowledge Graph Completion\", \"summary\": \"Reasoning paths are reliable information in knowledge graph completion (KGC)\\nin which algorithms can find strong clues of the actual relation between\\nentities. However, in real-world applications, it is difficult to guarantee\\nthat computationally affordable paths exist toward all candidate entities.\\nAccording to our observation, the prediction accuracy drops significantly when\\npaths are absent. To make the proposed algorithm more stable against the\\nmissing path circumstances, we introduce soft reasoning paths. Concretely, a\\nspecific learnable latent path embedding is concatenated to each relation to\\nhelp better model the characteristics of the corresponding paths. The\\ncombination of the relation and the corresponding learnable embedding is termed\\na soft path in our paper. By aligning the soft paths with the reasoning paths,\\na learnable embedding is guided to learn a generalized path representation of\\nthe corresponding relation. In addition, we introduce a hierarchical ranking\\nstrategy to make full use of information about the entity, relation, path, and\\nsoft path to help improve both the efficiency and accuracy of the model.\\nExtensive experimental results illustrate that our algorithm outperforms the\\ncompared state-of-the-art algorithms by a notable margin. The code will be made\\npublicly available after the paper is officially accepted.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:12:48Z\"}"}
