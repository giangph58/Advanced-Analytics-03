We first propose a full magnetic field foil winding formulation\\nby analogy with magnetic flux density conforming formulations. We then\\nintroduce the magnetic scalar potential in non-conducting regions to improve\\nthe efficiency of the model. This leads to a significant reduction in the\\nnumber of degrees of freedom, particularly in 3-D applications. The proposed\\nmodels are verified on two frequency-domain benchmark problems: a 2-D\\naxisymmetric problem and a 3-D problem. They reproduce results obtained with\\nmagnetic flux density conforming formulations and with resolved conductor\\nmodels that explicitly discretize all turns. Moreover, the models are applied\\nin the transient simulation of a high-temperature superconducting coil. In all\\ninvestigated configurations, the proposed models provide reliable results while\\nconsiderably reducing the size of the numerical problem to be solved.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CE\", \"categories\": \"cs.CE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T13:48:18Z\"}"}
