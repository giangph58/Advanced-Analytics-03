{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14829v1\", \"title\": \"$\\\\mathrm{M}$-ideals: from Banach spaces to rings\", \"summary\": \"We introduce and investigate a class of ring ideals, termed ring\\n$\\\\mathrm{M}$-ideals, inspired by the Alfsen--Effros theory of\\n$\\\\mathrm{M}$-ideals in Banach spaces. We show that $\\\\mathrm{M}$-ideals extend\\nthe classical notion of essential ideals and subsume them as a subclass. The\\ncentral theorem provides a full characterization: an ideal is an\\n$\\\\mathrm{M}$-ideal if and only if it is either essential or relatively\\nirreducible. This dichotomy reveals the abundant and diverse nature of\\n$\\\\mathrm{M}$-ideals, encompassing both essential and minimal ideals, and admits\\nnatural generalizations in rings beyond the commutative and unital settings.\\n  We systematically study the algebraic stability of $\\\\mathrm{M}$-ideals under\\nstandard constructions such as intersection, quotient, direct product, and\\nMorita equivalence and establish their behavior in topological rings and\\noperator algebras. In certain rings such as $\\\\mathbb{Z}_n$ and C*-algebras, we\\ncompletely classify $\\\\mathrm{M}$-ideals and relate them to algebraically\\nminimal projections and central idempotents. The ring $\\\\mathrm{M}$-ideals in\\n$C(K)$ are shown to be precisely the essential ideals or those minimal ideals\\ncorresponding to isolated points.\\n  Structurally, we show that the absence of proper $\\\\mathrm{M}$-ideals\\ncharacterizes simplicity, while rings in which every proper $\\\\mathrm{M}$-ideal\\nis a direct summand must decompose as finite direct sums of simple rings. In\\nclosing, we introduce the notion of $\\\\mathrm{M}$-complements, drawing an\\nanalogy with essential extensions in module theory, and demonstrate their\\nexistence.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RA\", \"categories\": \"math.RA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T03:13:39Z\"}"}
