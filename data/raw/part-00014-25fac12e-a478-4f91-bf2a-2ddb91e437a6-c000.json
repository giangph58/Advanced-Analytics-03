Our approach consists in reformulating the\\nVlasov-Poisson system as a hyperbolic problem by applying a spectral expansion\\nin the basis of Hermite functions in the velocity space and in designing a\\nstructure-preserving scheme for the time and spatial variables. Through this\\nHermite formulation, we establish a convergence result for the electric field\\ntoward its quasineutral limit together with optimal error estimates. Following\\nthis path, we then propose a fully discrete numerical method for the\\nVlasov-Poisson system, inspired by the approach in arXiv:2306.14605 , and\\nrigorously prove that it is uniformly consistent in the quasineutral limit\\nregime. Finally, we present several numerical simulations to illustrate the\\nbehavior of the proposed scheme. These results demonstrate the capability of\\nour method to describe quasineutral plasmas and confirm the theoretical\\nfindings: stability and asymptotic preservation.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T08:32:13Z\"}"}
