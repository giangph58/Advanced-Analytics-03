Here, we use the density-matrix\\nrenormalization-group to numerically analyze lattices of superconducting qubits\\nfrom a perspective of many-body localization. Specifically, we compare\\ndifferent architectures that include tunable couplers designed to decouple\\nqubits in the idle state, and calculate the residual ZZ interactions as well as\\nthe inverse participation ratio in the computational basis states. For transmon\\nqubits outside of the straddling regime, the results confirm that tunable\\nC-shunt flux couplers are significantly more efficient in mitigating the ZZ\\ninteractions than tunable transmons. A recently proposed fluxonium architecture\\nwith tunable transmon couplers is demonstrated to also maintain its strong\\nsuppression of the ZZ interactions in larger systems, while having a higher\\ninverse participation ratio in the computational basis states than lattices of\\ntransmon qubits. Our results thus suggest that fluxonium architectures may\\nfeature lower cross talk than transmon lattices when designed to achieve\\nsimilar gate speeds and fidelities.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T15:07:35Z\"}"}
