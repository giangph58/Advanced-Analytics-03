We\\nconsider the optimization problem in the framework of a linear elasticity\\nmodel. We choose three mechanical measures that define optimality via related\\nobjective functionals: the compliance, the \\\\(L^p\\\\)-norm of the von Mises\\nstress, and the area of the stretched skin. We provide a proof of the existence\\nof solutions for each problem, but we cannot claim uniqueness. We compute the\\ngradient of the objectives with respect to the cut configuration using shape\\ncalculus concepts. To solve the problem numerically, we use the gradient\\ndescent method, which performs well under uniaxial stretching. However, in more\\ncomplex cases, such as multidirectional stretching, its effectiveness is\\nlimited due to low sensitivity of the functionals. To avoid this difficulty, we\\nuse a combination of the genetic algorithm and the gradient descent method,\\nwhich leads to a significant improvement in the results.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T11:50:40Z\"}"}
