{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21716v1\", \"title\": \"Dynamics of Star Cluster Formation: The Effects of Ongoing Star\\n  Formation and Stellar Feedback\", \"summary\": \"We perform a high resolution zoom-in simulation of star cluster assembly\\nincluding the merger of two sub-clusters with initial conditions taken from\\nprevious large scale giant molecular cloud (GMC) simulations. We couple\\nhydrodynamics to N-body dynamics to simulate the individual stars themselves,\\nand the gas-rich environment in which they evolve. We include prescriptions for\\nstar formation and stellar feedback and compare directly to previous\\nsimulations of the same region without these prescriptions to determine their\\nrole in shaping the dynamics inherited from the cluster assembly process. The\\nstellar mass of the cluster grows through star formation within the cluster and\\naccretion of new stars and star forming gas from a nearby filament. This growth\\nresults in an enhancement in the cluster's rotation and anisotropic expansion\\ncompared to simulations without star formation. We also analyze the internal\\nkinematics of the cluster once it has lost most of its gas and find that the\\nrotational velocity and the velocity anisotropy profiles are qualitatively\\nsimilar to those expected of clusters that have undergone violent relaxation.\\nAs well, rotation and anisotropic expansion are still present by the time of\\ngas removal. This implies that evolution within the GMC was unable to\\ncompletely erase the kinematics inherited by the merger.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:28:36Z\"}"}
