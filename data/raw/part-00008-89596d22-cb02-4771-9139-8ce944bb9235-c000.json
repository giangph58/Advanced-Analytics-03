Quaternion matrices, with their ability to\\nnaturally model multi-dimensional data, offer a promising framework for this\\nproblem. This paper introduces the quaternion nuclear norm over the Frobenius\\nnorm (QNOF) as a novel nonconvex approximation for the rank of quaternion\\nmatrices. QNOF is parameter-free and scale-invariant. Utilizing quaternion\\nsingular value decomposition, we prove that solving the QNOF can be simplified\\nto solving the singular value $L_1/L_2$ problem. Additionally, we extend the\\nQNOF to robust quaternion matrix completion, employing the alternating\\ndirection multiplier method to derive solutions that guarantee weak convergence\\nunder mild conditions. Extensive numerical experiments validate the proposed\\nmodel's superiority, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art quaternion\\nmethods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T09:44:09Z\"}"}
