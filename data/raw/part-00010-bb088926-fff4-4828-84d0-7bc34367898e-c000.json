Next-generation\\nwireless communication networks increasingly employ uniform planar arrays (UPA)\\ndue to their ability to steer beamformers towards desired directions,\\nmitigating interference and eavesdropping. However, the application of\\nUPA-based CSS in cognitive radio remains largely unexplored. This paper\\nproposes a multi-beam UPA-based weighted CSS (WCSS) framework to enhance\\ndetection reliability, applicable to various cognitive radio networks,\\nincluding cellular, vehicular, and satellite communications. We first propose a\\nweighting factor for commonly used energy detection (ED) and eigenvalue\\ndetection (EVD) techniques, based on the spatial variation of signal strengths\\nresulting from UPA antenna beamforming. We then analytically characterize the\\nperformance of both weighted ED and weighted EVD by deriving closed-form\\nexpressions for false alarm and detection probabilities. Our numerical results,\\nconsidering both static and dynamic user behaviors, demonstrate the superiority\\nof WCSS in enhancing sensing performance compared to uniformly weighted\\ndetectors.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:36:56Z\"}"}
