{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20935v1\", \"title\": \"Note about the complexity of the acyclic orientation with parity\\n  constraint problem\", \"summary\": \"Let $G = (V, E)$ be a connected graph, and let $T$ in $V$ be a subset of\\nvertices. An orientation of $G$ is called $T$-odd if any vertex $v \\\\in V$ has\\nodd in-degree if and only if it is in $T$. Finding a T -odd orientation of G\\ncan be solved in polynomial time as shown by Chevalier, Jaeger, Payan and Xuong\\n(1983). Since then, $T$-odd orientations have continued to attract interest,\\nparticularly in the context of global constraints on the orientation. For\\ninstance, Frank and Kir\\\\'aly (2002) investigated $k$-connected $T$-odd\\norientations and raised questions about acyclic $T$-odd orientations. This\\nproblem is now recognized as an Egres problem and is known as the \\\"Acyclic\\norientation with parity constraints\\\" problem. Szegedy ( 005) proposed a\\nrandomized polynomial algorithm to address this problem. An easy consequence of\\nhis work provides a polynomial time algorithm for planar graphs whenever $|T |\\n= |V | - 1$. Nevertheless, it remains unknown whether it exists in general. In\\nthis paper we contribute to the understanding of the complexity of this problem\\nby studying a more general one. We prove that finding a $T$-odd acyclic\\norientation on graphs having some directed edges is NP-complete.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DM\", \"categories\": \"cs.DM,math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T16:56:48Z\"}"}
