The\\nproportionality constant, $c$, is dimensionless and independent of the system's\\nparameters. Remarkably, while $c$ is universally bounded by unity, it attains\\nthe exact value $c=1/2$ for particles in central potentials.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:08:41Z\"}"}
