However, the number of\\nbinaries with known orbital parameters remains limited. Utilizing the\\nLAMOST-MRS survey, we derived orbital solutions for 665 SB2 binaries by fitting\\nthe radial velocities of 1119 SB2 systems with at least six observations,\\nemploying a modified version of Thejoker optimized for SB2 binaries. To ensure\\nthe reliability of the results, four selection criteria were applied: reduced\\nchi-square, normalized mean absolute error, maximum phase gap, and RV\\ndistribution metric. After applying these criteria, 665 reliable orbits were\\nretained. Comparison with Kepler, TESS, and ZTF light curve data shows\\nexcellent agreement, with discrepancies in some cases attributed to shorter\\npulsation periods observed in light curves. Additionally, good consistency is\\nfound between our periods and those of SB1 systems in Gaia data. These orbital\\nsolutions contribute to understanding binary star evolution and the statistical\\nproperties of binary populations.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T10:30:46Z\"}"}
