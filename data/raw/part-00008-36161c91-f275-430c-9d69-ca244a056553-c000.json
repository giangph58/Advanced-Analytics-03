{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04997v1\", \"title\": \"Foam-Agent: Towards Automated Intelligent CFD Workflows\", \"summary\": \"Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is an essential simulation tool in various\\nengineering disciplines, but it often requires substantial domain expertise and\\nmanual configuration, creating barriers to entry. We present Foam-Agent, a\\nmulti-agent framework that automates complex OpenFOAM-based CFD simulation\\nworkflows from natural language inputs. Our innovation includes (1) a\\nhierarchical multi-index retrieval system with specialized indices for\\ndifferent simulation aspects, (2) a dependency-aware file generation system\\nthat provides consistency management across configuration files, and (3) an\\niterative error correction mechanism that diagnoses and resolves simulation\\nfailures without human intervention. Through comprehensive evaluation on the\\ndataset of 110 simulation tasks, Foam-Agent achieves an 83.6% success rate with\\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet, significantly outperforming existing frameworks (55.5% for\\nMetaOpenFOAM and 37.3% for OpenFOAM-GPT). Ablation studies demonstrate the\\ncritical contribution of each system component, with the specialized error\\ncorrection mechanism providing a 36.4% performance improvement. Foam-Agent\\nsubstantially lowers the CFD expertise threshold while maintaining modeling\\naccuracy, demonstrating the potential of specialized multi-agent systems to\\ndemocratize access to complex scientific simulation tools.
