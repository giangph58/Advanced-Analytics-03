{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00683v1\", \"title\": \"Quantum Circuit Overhead\", \"summary\": \"We introduce a measure for evaluating the efficiency of finite universal\\nquantum gate sets $\\\\mathcal{S}$, called the Quantum Circuit Overhead (QCO), and\\nthe related notion of $T$-Quantum Circuit Overhead ($T$-QCO). The overhead is\\nbased on the comparison between the efficiency of $\\\\mathcal{S}$ versus the\\noptimal efficiency among all gate sets with the same number of gates. We\\ndemonstrate the usefulness of the ($T$-)QCO by extensive numerical calculations\\nof its upper bounds, providing insight into the efficiency of various choices\\nof single-qubit $\\\\mathcal{S}$, including Haar-random gate sets and the gate\\nsets derived from finite subgroups, such as Clifford and Hurwitz groups. In\\nparticular, our results suggest that, in terms of the upper bounds on the\\n$T$-QCO, the famous T gate is a highly non-optimal choice for the completion of\\nthe Clifford gate set, even among the gates of order 8. We identify the optimal\\nchoices of such completions for both finite subgroups.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T17:43:33Z\"}"}
