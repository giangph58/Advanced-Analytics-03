However, node deletion is not always feasible in certain\\npractical scenarios. We consider the maximum shortest path interdiction problem\\nby upgrading nodes on trees under unit cost (MSPIT-UN$_u$). It aims to upgrade\\na subset of nodes to maximize the length of the shortest root-leaf distance\\nsuch that the total upgrade cost under unit cost is upper bounded by a given\\nvalue. We develop a dynamic programming algorithm with a time complexity of\\n$O(n^3)$ to solve this problem. Furthermore, we consider the related minimum\\ncost problem of (MSPIT-UN$_u$) and propose an $O(n^3\\\\log n)$ binary search\\nalgorithm, where a dynamic programming algorithm is exceeded in each iteration\\nto solve its corresponding problem (MSPIT-UN$_u$). Finally, we design numerical\\nexperiments to show the effectiveness of the algorithms.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T15:41:34Z\"}"}
