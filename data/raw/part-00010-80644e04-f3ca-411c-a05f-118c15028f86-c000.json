{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05232v1\", \"title\": \"ChemRxivQuest: A Curated Chemistry Question-Answer Database Extracted\\n  from ChemRxiv Preprints\", \"summary\": \"The rapid expansion of chemistry literature poses significant challenges for\\nresearchers seeking to efficiently access domain-specific knowledge. To support\\nadvancements in chemistry-focused natural language processing (NLP), we present\\nChemRxivQuest, a curated dataset of 970 high-quality question-answer (QA) pairs\\nderived from 155 ChemRxiv preprints across 17 subfields of chemistry. Each QA\\npair is explicitly linked to its source text segment to ensure traceability and\\ncontextual accuracy. ChemRxivQuest was constructed using an automated pipeline\\nthat combines optical character recognition (OCR), GPT-4o-based QA generation,\\nand a fuzzy matching technique for answer verification. The dataset emphasizes\\nconceptual, mechanistic, applied, and experimental questions, enabling\\napplications in retrieval-based QA systems, search engine development, and\\nfine-tuning of domain-adapted large language models. We analyze the dataset's\\nstructure, coverage, and limitations, and outline future directions for\\nexpansion and expert validation. ChemRxivQuest provides a foundational resource\\nfor chemistry NLP research, education, and tool development.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:26:33Z\"}"}
