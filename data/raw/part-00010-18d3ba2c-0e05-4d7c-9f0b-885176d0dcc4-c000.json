There are three types of bias. One\\narises from anisotropy of the kinematic pressure tensor and has been already\\nwell studied; a second arises from departures from equilibrium; and a third\\narises because of heterogeneity of the clusters used, from their individual\\nnon-sphericity, and because velocities used are measured with respect to\\ncentres that are, in general, accelerating. Here we focus on the latter two. We\\nstack clusters to measure the pressure tensor and density profiles and then\\nestimate the dynamical mass profile using the Jeans equation, and compare to\\nthe actual mean mass profile. The main result of this paper is an estimate of\\nthe bias, that can be used to correct the dynamical mass estimate, and we show\\nhow it depends on the cluster sample selection. We find that Jeans equation\\ntypically overestimates the true mass by about 20\\\\% at the virial radius.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:56:14Z\"}"}
