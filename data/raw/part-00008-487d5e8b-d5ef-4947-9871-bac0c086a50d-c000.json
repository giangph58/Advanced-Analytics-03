We reformulate a\\nclassical optimal control problem, constrained by a differential equation\\nsystem, into an optimization framework that uses neural networks to represent\\ncontrol variables. We demonstrate that this deep learning method adheres to\\nPontryagin Maximum Principle and mitigates numerical instabilities by employing\\nbackward propagation instead of a backward sweep for the adjoint equations. As\\na case study, we solve an optimal control problem to find the optimal\\ncombination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Our approach holds significant\\npotential across various fields, including epidemiology, ecological modeling,\\nengineering, and financial mathematics, where optimal control under complex\\ndynamic constraints is crucial.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T16:58:37Z\"}"}
