{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15738v1\", \"title\": \"RRC Signaling Storm Detection in O-RAN\", \"summary\": \"The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) marks a significant shift in the mobile\\nnetwork industry. By transforming a traditionally vertically integrated\\narchitecture into an open, data-driven one, O-RAN promises to enhance\\noperational flexibility and drive innovation. In this paper, we harness O-RAN's\\nopenness to address one critical threat to 5G availability: signaling storms\\ncaused by abuse of the Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol. Such attacks\\noccur when a flood of RRC messages from one or multiple User Equipments (UEs)\\ndeplete resources at a 5G base station (gNB), leading to service degradation.\\nWe provide a reference implementation of an RRC signaling storm attack, using\\nthe OpenAirInterface (OAI) platform to evaluate its impact on a gNB. We\\nsupplement the experimental results with a theoretical model to extend the\\nfindings for different load conditions. To mitigate RRC signaling storms, we\\ndevelop a threshold-based detection technique that relies on RRC layer features\\nto distinguish between malicious activity and legitimate high network load\\nconditions. Leveraging O-RAN capabilities, our detection method is deployed as\\nan external Application (xApp). Performance evaluation shows attacks can be\\ndetected within 90ms, providing a mitigation window of 60ms before gNB\\nunavailability, with an overhead of 1.2% and 0% CPU and memory consumption,\\nrespectively.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T09:32:11Z\"}"}
