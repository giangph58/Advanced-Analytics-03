{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05164v1\", \"title\": \"Balancing Task-invariant Interaction and Task-specific Adaptation for\\n  Unified Image Fusion\", \"summary\": \"Unified image fusion aims to integrate complementary information from\\nmulti-source images, enhancing image quality through a unified framework\\napplicable to diverse fusion tasks. While treating all fusion tasks as a\\nunified problem facilitates task-invariant knowledge sharing, it often\\noverlooks task-specific characteristics, thereby limiting the overall\\nperformance. Existing general image fusion methods incorporate explicit task\\nidentification to enable adaptation to different fusion tasks. However, this\\ndependence during inference restricts the model's generalization to unseen\\nfusion tasks. To address these issues, we propose a novel unified image fusion\\nframework named \\\"TITA\\\", which dynamically balances both Task-invariant\\nInteraction and Task-specific Adaptation. For task-invariant interaction, we\\nintroduce the Interaction-enhanced Pixel Attention (IPA) module to enhance\\npixel-wise interactions for better multi-source complementary information\\nextraction. For task-specific adaptation, the Operation-based Adaptive Fusion\\n(OAF) module dynamically adjusts operation weights based on task properties.\\nAdditionally, we incorporate the Fast Adaptive Multitask Optimization (FAMO)\\nstrategy to mitigate the impact of gradient conflicts across tasks during joint\\ntraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TITA not only achieves\\ncompetitive performance compared to specialized methods across three image\\nfusion scenarios but also exhibits strong generalization to unseen fusion\\ntasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T15:08:35Z\"}"}
