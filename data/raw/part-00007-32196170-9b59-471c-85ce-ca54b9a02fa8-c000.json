The DS obtained, which reveals closely related entities, has\\nbeen found to be useful in various application domains such as e-commerce,\\nsocial science, and biology. However, in a big graph that contains billions of\\nedges, it is desirable to find more than one subgraph cluster that is not\\nnecessarily the densest, yet they reveal closely related vertices. In this\\npaper, we study the locally densest subgraph (LDS), a recently proposed variant\\nof DS. An LDS is a subgraph which is the densest among the ``local neighbors''.\\nGiven a graph $G$, a number of LDSs can be returned, which reflect different\\ndense regions of $G$ and thus give more information than DS. The existing LDS\\nsolution suffers from low efficiency. We thus develop a\\nconvex-programming-based solution that enables powerful pruning. We also extend\\nour algorithm to triangle-based density to solve LTDS problem. Based on current\\nalgorithms, we propose a unified framework for the LDS and LTDS problems.\\nExtensive experiments on thirteen real large graph datasets show that our\\nproposed algorithm is up to four orders of magnitude faster than the\\nstate-of-the-art.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DB\", \"categories\": \"cs.DB\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T07:32:35Z\"}"}
