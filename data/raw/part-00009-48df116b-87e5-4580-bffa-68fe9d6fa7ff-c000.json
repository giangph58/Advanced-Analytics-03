{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20978v1\", \"title\": \"Coloring graphs as complete graph invariants\", \"summary\": \"For a graph $G$, the $k$-coloring graph $\\\\mathcal{C}_{k}(G)$ is obtained by\\ntaking the vertices to be the proper $k$-colorings of $G$ and two $k$-colorings\\nare incident if they differ exactly on one vertex of $G$. Hogan, Scott,\\nTamitegama and Tan recently proved that $\\\\mathcal{C}_{k_1}(G_1)\\\\cong\\n\\\\mathcal{C}_{k_2}(G_2)$ with $k_1>5n_1^2$ and $k_2>5n_2^2$ implies $G_1\\\\cong\\nG_2$, where $n_i$ is the number of vertices of $G_i$ for $i=1,2$. We sharpen\\nthis result by showing that $\\\\mathcal{C}_{k_1}(G_1)\\\\cong\\n\\\\mathcal{C}_{k_2}(G_2)$ with $k_1>\\\\chi(G_1)$ and $k_2>\\\\chi(G_2)$ implies\\n$G_1\\\\cong G_2$, where $\\\\chi(G)$ is the chromatic number of $G$. In other words,\\ngiven any graph $\\\\mathcal{C}$, there is at most one pair of $G$ and $k>\\\\chi(G)$\\nsuch that $\\\\mathcal C=\\\\mathcal C_k(G)$, and we additionally provide an\\nalgorithm to reconstruct $(G,k)$ from $\\\\mathcal C$ or determine that no such\\npair exists. Moreover, our requirement that $k>\\\\chi$ is tight because coloring\\ngraphs are empty for $k<\\\\chi$ and there exist examples of non-isomorphic\\n$G_1,G_2$ with $k=\\\\chi(G_1)=\\\\chi(G_2)$ such that $\\\\mathcal C_k(G_1)\\\\cong\\n\\\\mathcal C_k(G_2)$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:49:06Z\"}"}
