Unlike conventional approaches, we assume that the background\\npermittivity and permeability are unknown due to their dependence on frequency\\nand temperature, and we propose a normalized imaging function to localize\\ncracks. Despite inaccuracies in background parameters, application of the\\nproposed imaging function enables to recognize the existence of crack but it is\\nstill impossible to identify accurate crack locations. Furthermore, the shift\\nin crack localization of imaging results is significantly influenced by the\\napplied background parameters. In order to theoretically explain this\\nphenomenon, we show that the imaging function can be expressed in terms of the\\nzero-order Bessel function of the first kind, the crack lengths, and the\\napplied inaccurate background wavenumber corresponding to the applied\\ninaccurate background permittivity and permeability. Various numerical\\nsimulations results with synthetic data polluted by random noise validate the\\ntheoretical results.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T05:01:12Z\"}"}
