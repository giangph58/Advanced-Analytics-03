In this work, we develop\\nthe sum-over-states numerical method and the Hylleraas variational perturbation\\napproximation to calculate the multipole nuclear shielding factors for general\\none-electron systems and apply them to the model of the hydrogen atom confined\\nby a spherical cavity. The generalized pseudospectral method is employed to\\nsolve the eigenstates of the unperturbed atom. The obtained dipole nuclear\\nshielding factors are in good agreement with previous calculations and the\\nhigher-pole results are reported for the first time. The asymptotic behaviors\\nof the multipole nuclear shielding factors in both the large- and\\nsmall-confinement limits are analyzed with the assistance of variational\\nperturbation theory. The free-atom values can be exactly reproduced by the\\nsecond-order perturbation approximation and all multipole nuclear shielding\\nfactors in the small-confinement limit tend to zero by a linear law. The\\nvariational perturbation method manifests exponential convergence with\\nincreasing the order of approximation. The numerical and approximate methods\\ndeveloped in this work together pave the way for further investigation of the\\nmultipole nuclear shielding factors for general atomic systems.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T07:20:21Z\"}"}
