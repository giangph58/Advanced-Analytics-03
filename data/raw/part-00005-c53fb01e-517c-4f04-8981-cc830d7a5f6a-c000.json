However, this leads to increased qubit requirements and often\\ndistorts the optimization landscape, making it harder to find high-quality\\nfeasible solutions. To address these issues, we explore a slack-free\\nformulation that directly encodes inequality constraints using custom penalty\\nfunctions, specifically the exponential function and the Heaviside step\\nfunction. These step-like penalties suppress infeasible solutions without\\nintroducing additional qubits or requiring finely tuned weights. Inspired by\\nrecent developments in quantum annealing and threshold-based constraint\\nhandling in gate-based algorithms, we implement and evaluate our approach on\\nthe Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP). Experimental results show that the\\nstep-based formulation significantly improves feasibility and optimality rates\\ncompared to unbalanced penalization, while reducing overall qubit overhead.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T03:20:02Z\"}"}
