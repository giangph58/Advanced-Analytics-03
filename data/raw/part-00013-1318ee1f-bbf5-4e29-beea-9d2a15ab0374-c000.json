As a starting point, we use two transformations of\\nbilateral basic very-well-poised ${}_8\\\\Psi_8$. The first transformation is\\ngiven as a sum of two nonterminating ${}_8W_7$'s and the second is given in\\nterms of a sum of a ${}_4\\\\psi_4$ and two balanced ${}_4\\\\phi_3$'s. From these\\ntransformations we derive limiting transformations with vanishing denominator\\nelements which shed light on the transformation properties of these bilateral\\nbasic hypergeometric series. We also study tuple product identities, namely\\ntriple, quintuple, sextuple, septuple, octuple, nonuple and undecuple, which\\nare given in terms of sums of bilateral basic hypergeometric series.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CA\", \"categories\": \"math.CA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T16:38:36Z\"}"}
