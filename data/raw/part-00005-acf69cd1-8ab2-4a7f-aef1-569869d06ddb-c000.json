{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04365v1\", \"title\": \"CDE-Mapper: Using Retrieval-Augmented Language Models for Linking\\n  Clinical Data Elements to Controlled Vocabularies\", \"summary\": \"The standardization of clinical data elements (CDEs) aims to ensure\\nconsistent and comprehensive patient information across various healthcare\\nsystems. Existing methods often falter when standardizing CDEs of varying\\nrepresentation and complex structure, impeding data integration and\\ninteroperability in clinical research. We introduce CDE-Mapper, an innovative\\nframework that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation approach combined with\\nLarge Language Models to automate the linking of CDEs to controlled\\nvocabularies. Our modular approach features query decomposition to manage\\nvarying levels of CDEs complexity, integrates expert-defined rules within\\nprompt engineering, and employs in-context learning alongside multiple\\nretriever components to resolve terminological ambiguities. In addition, we\\npropose a knowledge reservoir validated by a human-in-loop approach, achieving\\naccurate concept linking for future applications while minimizing computational\\ncosts. For four diverse datasets, CDE-Mapper achieved an average of 7.2\\\\%\\nhigher accuracy improvement compared to baseline methods. This work highlights\\nthe potential of advanced language models in improving data harmonization and\\nsignificantly advancing capabilities in clinical decision support systems and\\nresearch.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR,J.3\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T12:32:05Z\"}"}
