{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00354v1\", \"title\": \"Multi-segment Soft Robot Control via Deep Koopman-based Model Predictive\\n  Control\", \"summary\": \"Soft robots, compared to regular rigid robots, as their multiple segments\\nwith soft materials bring flexibility and compliance, have the advantages of\\nsafe interaction and dexterous operation in the environment. However, due to\\nits characteristics of high dimensional, nonlinearity, time-varying nature, and\\ninfinite degree of freedom, it has been challenges in achieving precise and\\ndynamic control such as trajectory tracking and position reaching. To address\\nthese challenges, we propose a framework of Deep Koopman-based Model Predictive\\nControl (DK-MPC) for handling multi-segment soft robots. We first employ a deep\\nlearning approach with sampling data to approximate the Koopman operator, which\\ntherefore linearizes the high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics of the soft robots\\ninto a finite-dimensional linear representation. Secondly, this linearized\\nmodel is utilized within a model predictive control framework to compute\\noptimal control inputs that minimize the tracking error between the desired and\\nactual state trajectories. The real-world experiments on the soft robot\\n\\\"Chordata\\\" demonstrate that DK-MPC could achieve high-precision control,\\nshowing the potential of DK-MPC for future applications to soft robots.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T06:53:09Z\"}"}
