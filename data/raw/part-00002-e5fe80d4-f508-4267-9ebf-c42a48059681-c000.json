We propose a high-fidelity quantum control\\nframework based on the quasi-topological number ($\\\\nu_{\\\\text{qua}}$), which\\nextends the traditional Chern number to characterize geometric responses in\\nnon-closed paths. By introducing a counterdiabatic gauge potential (AGP) that\\ndynamically suppresses non-adiabatic transitions and reconstructs path\\ncurvature, we demonstrate that $\\\\nu_{\\\\text{qua}}$ -a relative homotopy\\ninvariant of compact manifolds in parameter space-quantifies the robustness of\\ngeometric phases during open-path quantum evolution. This integer invariant\\nensures gauge-invariant suppression of decoherence errors arising from\\ndynamical phase coupling. By introducing nonlinear parametric ring paths, we\\naddress the defects caused by intermediate states in the Rydberg atomic system.\\nNumerical simulations in the Kitaev superconducting chain and 2D\\ntransverse-field Ising model confirm that our protocol achieves quantum gate\\nfidelity exceeding $\\\\mathcal{F} > 0.9999$. We bridges geometric quantum control\\nwith topological protection, offering a universal approach to noise-resistant\\nquantum computing.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T08:35:43Z\"}"}
