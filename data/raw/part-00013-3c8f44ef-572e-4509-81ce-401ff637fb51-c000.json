Consider $n$ algebraically\\nindependent elements $g_1, \\\\dots, g_n$ in $\\\\mathcal{R}$. Let $\\\\mathcal{S}$\\ndenote the subring of $\\\\mathcal{R}$ generated by $g_1, \\\\dots, g_n$, and let $h$\\nbe an element of $\\\\mathcal{S}$. Then, there exists a unique element ${f} \\\\in\\n\\\\mathbb{K}[u_1, \\\\dots, u_n]$ such that $h = f(g_1, \\\\dots, g_n)$.\\n  In this paper, we provide an algorithm for computing ${f}$, given $h$ and\\n$g_1, \\\\dots, g_n$. The complexity of our algorithm is linear in the size of the\\ninput, $h$ and $g_1, \\\\dots, g_n$, and polynomial in $n$ when the degree of $f$\\nis fixed. Previous works are mostly known when $f$ is a symmetric polynomial\\nand $g_1, \\\\dots, g_n$ are elementary symmetric, homogeneous symmetric, or power\\nsymmetric polynomials.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SC\", \"categories\": \"cs.SC,cs.CC,math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:52:31Z\"}"}
