{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07802v1\", \"title\": \"Cable Optimization and Drag Estimation for Tether-Powered Multirotor\\n  UAVs\", \"summary\": \"The flight time of multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is typically\\nconstrained by their high power consumption. Tethered power systems present a\\nviable solution to extend flight times while maintaining the advantages of\\nmultirotor UAVs, such as hover capability and agility. This paper addresses the\\ncritical aspect of cable selection for tether-powered multirotor UAVs,\\nconsidering both hover and forward flight. Existing research often overlooks\\nthe trade-offs between cable mass, power losses, and system constraints. We\\npropose a novel methodology to optimize cable selection, accounting for thrust\\nrequirements and power efficiency across various flight conditions. The\\napproach combines physics-informed modeling with system identification to\\ncombine hover and forward flight dynamics, incorporating factors such as motor\\nefficiency, tether resistance, and aerodynamic drag. This work provides an\\nintuitive and practical framework for optimizing tethered UAV designs, ensuring\\nefficient power transmission and flight performance. Thus allowing for better,\\nsafer, and more efficient tethered drones.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:38:44Z\"}"}
