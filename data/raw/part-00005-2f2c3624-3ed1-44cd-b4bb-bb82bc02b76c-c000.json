However, we discovered some problems that can be improved in the\\nsupply chain that delivers drug samples (used for the treatment of excess\\nglucose). Databases were integrated; then we apply data extraction and\\ntransformation; and finally we apply multiple regression analysis to explain\\ndrug sales. The first analysis evaluates the integration of regional data and\\nthe second analysis refers to data dis-aggregated by region. We identify the\\nregion with the greatest impact on sales and the impact of the delivery of drug\\nsamples in the Mexican market.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T02:11:38Z\"}"}
