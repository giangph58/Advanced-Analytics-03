However, an\\nintegration of communication and artificial intelligence (AI) also exposes\\nSemCom to security and privacy threats posed by intelligent eavesdroppers. To\\naddress this challenge, image steganography in SemCom embeds secret semantic\\nfeatures within cover semantic features, allowing intelligent eavesdroppers to\\ndecode only the cover image. This technique offers a form of \\\"invisible\\nencryption\\\" for SemCom. Motivated by these advancements, this paper conducts a\\ncomprehensive exploration of integrating image steganography into SemCom.\\nFirstly, we review existing encryption techniques in SemCom and assess the\\npotential of image steganography in enhancing its security. Secondly, we delve\\ninto various image steganographic paradigms designed to secure SemCom,\\nencompassing three categories of joint source-channel coding (JSCC) models\\ntailored for image steganography SemCom, along with multiple training\\nstrategies. Thirdly, we present a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of\\ncoverless steganography SemCom. Finally, we propose future research directions\\nfor image steganography SemCom.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:38:15Z\"}"}
