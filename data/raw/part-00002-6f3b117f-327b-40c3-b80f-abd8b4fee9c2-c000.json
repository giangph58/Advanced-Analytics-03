The\\n  bird and batching algorithms and other parallel implementations on GPUs\", \"summary\": \"We present efficient implementations of atom reconfiguration algorithms for\\nboth CPUs and GPUs, along with a batching routine to merge displacement\\noperations for parallel execution. Leveraging graph-theoretic methods, our\\napproach derives improved algorithms that achieve reduced time complexity and\\nfaster operational running times. First, we introduce an enhanced version of\\nthe redistribution-reconfiguration (red-rec) algorithm, which offers superior\\noperational and runtime performance. We detail its efficient implementation on\\na GPU using a parallel approach. Next, we present an optimized version of the\\nassignment-reconfiguration-ordering (aro) algorithm, specifically tailored for\\nunweighted grid graphs. Finally, we introduce the bird algorithm to solve\\nreconfiguration problems on grids, achieving performance gains over both\\nred-rec and aro. These algorithms can be used to prepare defect-free\\nconfigurations of neutral atoms in arrays of optical traps, serve as\\nsubroutines in more complex algorithms, or cross-benchmark the operational and\\nruntime performance of new algorithms. They are suitable for realizing quantum\\ncircuits incorporating displacement operations and are optimized for real-time\\noperation on increasingly large system sizes.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T16:22:42Z\"}"}
