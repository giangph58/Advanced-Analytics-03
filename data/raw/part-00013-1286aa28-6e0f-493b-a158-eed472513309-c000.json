{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20398v1\", \"title\": \"Noise limits for dc SQUID readout of high-$Q$ resonators below 300 MHz\", \"summary\": \"We present the limits on noise for the readout of cryogenic high-$Q$\\nresonators using dc Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) below\\n300 MHz. This analysis uses realized first-stage SQUIDs (previously published),\\nwhose performance is well described by Tesche-Clarke (TC) theory, coupled\\ndirectly to the resonators. We also present data from a prototype second-stage\\ndc SQUID array designed to couple to this first-stage SQUID as a follow-on\\namplifier with high system bandwidth. This analysis is the first full\\nconsideration of dc SQUID noise performance referred to a high-$Q$ resonator\\nover this frequency range, and is presented relative to the standard quantum\\nlimit. We include imprecision, backaction, and backaction-imprecision noise\\ncorrelations from TC theory, the noise contributed by the second-stage SQUIDs,\\nwiring, and preamplifiers, and optimizations for both on-resonance measurements\\nand off-resonance scan sensitivity. This architecture has modern relevance due\\nto the increased interest in axion searches and the requirements of the\\nDMRadio-m$^3$ axion search, which will use dc SQUIDs in this frequency range.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T03:42:06Z\"}"}
