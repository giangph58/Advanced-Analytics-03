{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05266v1\", \"title\": \"PUDTune: Multi-Level Charging for High-Precision Calibration in\\n  Processing-Using-DRAM\", \"summary\": \"Recently, practical analog in-memory computing has been realized using\\nunmodified commercial DRAM modules. The underlying Processing-Using-DRAM (PUD)\\ntechniques enable high-throughput bitwise operations directly within DRAM\\narrays. However, the presence of inherent error-prone columns hinders PUD's\\npractical adoption. While selectively using only error-free columns would\\nensure reliability, this approach significantly reduces PUD's computational\\nthroughput.\\n  This paper presents PUDTune, a novel high-precision calibration technique for\\nincreasing the number of error-free columns in PUD. PUDTune compensates for\\nerrors by applying pre-identified column-specific offsets to PUD operations. By\\nleveraging multi-level charge states of DRAM cells, PUDTune generates\\nfine-grained and wide-range offset variations despite the limited available\\nrows. Our experiments with DDR4 DRAM demonstrate that PUDTune increases the\\nnumber of error-free columns by 1.81$\\\\times$ compared to conventional\\nimplementations, improving addition and multiplication throughput by\\n1.88$\\\\times$ and 1.89$\\\\times$ respectively.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AR\", \"categories\": \"cs.AR,cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:13:35Z\"}"}
