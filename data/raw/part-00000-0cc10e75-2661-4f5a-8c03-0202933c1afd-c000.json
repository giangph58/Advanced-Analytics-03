{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12829v1\", \"title\": \"Particle-based Simulation of an Air-Breathing Electric Propulsion System\", \"summary\": \"A novel concept called Air-Breathing Electric Propulsion proposes to fly\\nsatellites at altitudes in the range 180-250 km, since this would have some\\nadvantages for the performance of radio communication and Earth observation\\nequipment. The ABEP satellites compensate the atmospheric drag through a\\ncontinuous thrust provided by collecting, ionizing and accelerating the\\nresidual atmospheric particles. It is clear that the feasibility of this\\nconcept will require a significant design and testing effort, performed first\\non ground and later in orbit. Plasma simulation tools play a fundamental role\\nin the development of this technology, for two main reasons: (i) they can\\npotentially increase dramatically the optimization and testing process of ABEP\\nsystems, since on-ground testing and in-orbit demonstrators are costly and time\\nconsuming, and (ii) the fidelity of on-ground testing is limited by the finite\\nsize and pumping speed of high-vacuum facilities, as well as the means through\\nwhich the orbital flow is produced. In this paper, we demonstrate a one-way\\ncoupled, particle-based simulation strategy for a CubeSat sized ABEP system.\\nThe neutral flow in the full geometry of the ABEP system comprising the intake\\nand the thruster is simulated first through Direct Simulation Monte Carlo.\\nThen, the resulting neutral density is used as the input for a Particle-in-Cell\\nsimulation of the detailed thruster geometry. The simulations are performed in\\n3D and within the VKI in-house code Pantera, taking advantage of the\\nfully-implicit energy-conserving scheme.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T10:42:59Z\"}"}
