We show, through bias control of an\\nisotopically purified silicon carbide (SiC) p-i-n diode, the depletion of not\\nonly electrical noise sources but also magnetic noise sources, resulting in\\nrecord coherences for SiC electron spin qubits. We also uncover complementary\\nimprovements to the relaxation times of nuclear spin registers controllable by\\nthe defect, and measure diode-enhanced coherences. These improvements lead to\\nrecord-long nuclear spin Hahn-echo times on the scale of minutes. These results\\ndemonstrate the power of materials control and electronic device integration to\\ncreate highly coherent solid-state quantum network nodes and processors.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:58:52Z\"}"}
