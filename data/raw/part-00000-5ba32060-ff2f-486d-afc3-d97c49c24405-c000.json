{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21856v1\", \"title\": \"Holography and Causality in the Karch-Randall Braneworld\", \"summary\": \"It has been argued that the existence of a geodesic shortcut in the\\nKarch-Randall (KR) braneworld rules out the possibility for a low-energy\\nintermediate theory, even when gravity is turned off. We study this problem in\\nan explicit example with two symmetrically placed KR branes. We find that there\\ncan be a consistent quantization of bulk matter fields with a holographic\\nintermediate description. In our model, there is no causality violation. We use\\nthis example to study potential implications of the bulk geodesic shortcut. We\\nfind that there are possible enhancements of the correlation or entanglement\\nbetween the two branes that is directly correlated with the extra-dimensional\\ngeometry. This could affect the low-energy regime when there are interactions\\nbetween low and high energy modes. Our model makes it clear that any possible\\ncausality violation can only arise from the UV. Independently of the\\nquantization, an intermediate description should be valid as an EFT.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,gr-qc,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:59:59Z\"}"}
