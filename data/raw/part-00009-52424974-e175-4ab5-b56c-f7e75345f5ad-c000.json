{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05071v1\", \"title\": \"AI-Driven Tactical Communications and Networking for Defense: A Survey\\n  and Emerging Trends\", \"summary\": \"The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in military communications\\nand networking is reshaping modern defense strategies, enhancing secure data\\nexchange, real-time situational awareness, and autonomous decision-making. This\\nsurvey explores how AI-driven technologies improve tactical communication\\nnetworks, radar-based data transmission, UAV-assisted relay systems, and\\nelectronic warfare resilience. The study highlights AI applications in adaptive\\nsignal processing, multi-agent coordination for network optimization,\\nradar-assisted target tracking, and AI-driven electronic countermeasures. Our\\nwork introduces a novel three-criteria evaluation methodology. It\\nsystematically assesses AI applications based on general system objectives,\\ncommunications constraints in the military domain, and critical tactical\\nenvironmental factors. We analyze key AI techniques for different types of\\nlearning applied to multi-domain network interoperability and distributed data\\ninformation fusion in military operations. We also address challenges such as\\nadversarial AI threats, the real-time adaptability of autonomous communication\\nnetworks, and the limitations of current AI models under battlefield\\nconditions. Finally, we discuss emerging trends in self-healing networks,\\nAI-augmented decision support systems, and intelligent spectrum allocation. We\\nprovide a structured roadmap for future AI-driven defense communications and\\nnetworking research.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.LG,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:38:32Z\"}"}
