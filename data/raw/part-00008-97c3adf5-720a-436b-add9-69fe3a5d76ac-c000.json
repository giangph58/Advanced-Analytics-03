Mobile phone surveys provide a scalable and temporally rich data\\nsource that can be tailored to different administrative levels. However, due to\\ncost and operational constraints, maintaining high-frequency data collection\\nwhile ensuring representativeness at lower administrative levels is often\\ninfeasible. We propose a joint multilevel regression and poststratification\\n(jMRP) approach that combines high-frequency and up-to-date mobile phone survey\\ndata, designed for higher administrative levels, with an annual face-to-face\\nsurvey representative at lower levels to produce reliable food security\\nestimates at spatially and temporally finer scales than those originally\\ntargeted by the surveys. This methodology accounts for systematic differences\\nin survey responses due to modality and socio-economic characteristics,\\nreducing both sampling and modality bias. We implement the approach in a fully\\nBayesian manner to quantify uncertainty. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\\nour method using data from Zimbabwe, thus offering a cost-effective solution\\nfor real-time monitoring and strengthening decision-making in\\nresource-constrained settings.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T13:27:02Z\"}"}
