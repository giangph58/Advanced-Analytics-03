{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20902v1\", \"title\": \"Classifier-to-Bias: Toward Unsupervised Automatic Bias Detection for\\n  Visual Classifiers\", \"summary\": \"A person downloading a pre-trained model from the web should be aware of its\\nbiases. Existing approaches for bias identification rely on datasets containing\\nlabels for the task of interest, something that a non-expert may not have\\naccess to, or may not have the necessary resources to collect: this greatly\\nlimits the number of tasks where model biases can be identified. In this work,\\nwe present Classifier-to-Bias (C2B), the first bias discovery framework that\\nworks without access to any labeled data: it only relies on a textual\\ndescription of the classification task to identify biases in the target\\nclassification model. This description is fed to a large language model to\\ngenerate bias proposals and corresponding captions depicting biases together\\nwith task-specific target labels. A retrieval model collects images for those\\ncaptions, which are then used to assess the accuracy of the model w.r.t. the\\ngiven biases. C2B is training-free, does not require any annotations, has no\\nconstraints on the list of biases, and can be applied to any pre-trained model\\non any classification task. Experiments on two publicly available datasets show\\nthat C2B discovers biases beyond those of the original datasets and outperforms\\na recent state-of-the-art bias detection baseline that relies on task-specific\\nannotations, being a promising first step toward addressing task-agnostic\\nunsupervised bias detection.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T16:19:38Z\"}"}
