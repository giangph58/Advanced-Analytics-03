{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21420v1\", \"title\": \"A Test Suite for Efficient Robustness Evaluation of Face Recognition\\n  Systems\", \"summary\": \"Face recognition is a widely used authentication technology in practice,\\nwhere robustness is required. It is thus essential to have an efficient and\\neasy-to-use method for evaluating the robustness of (possibly third-party)\\ntrained face recognition systems. Existing approaches to evaluating the\\nrobustness of face recognition systems are either based on empirical evaluation\\n(e.g., measuring attacking success rate using state-of-the-art attacking\\nmethods) or formal analysis (e.g., measuring the Lipschitz constant). While the\\nformer demands significant user efforts and expertise, the latter is extremely\\ntime-consuming. In pursuit of a comprehensive, efficient, easy-to-use and\\nscalable estimation of the robustness of face recognition systems, we take an\\nold-school alternative approach and introduce RobFace, i.e., evaluation using\\nan optimised test suite. It contains transferable adversarial face images that\\nare designed to comprehensively evaluate a face recognition system's robustness\\nalong a variety of dimensions. RobFace is system-agnostic and still consistent\\nwith system-specific empirical evaluation or formal analysis. We support this\\nclaim through extensive experimental results with various perturbations on\\nmultiple face recognition systems. To our knowledge, RobFace is the first\\nsystem-agnostic robustness estimation test suite.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T08:27:08Z\"}"}
