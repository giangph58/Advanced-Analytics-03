{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21710v1\", \"title\": \"While-alive regression analysis of composite survival endpoints\", \"summary\": \"Composite endpoints, which combine two or more distinct outcomes, are\\nfrequently used in clinical trials to enhance the event rate and improve the\\nstatistical power. In the recent literature, the while-alive cumulative\\nfrequency measure offers a strong alternative to define composite survival\\noutcomes, by relating the average event rate to the survival time. Although\\nnon-parametric methods have been proposed for two-sample comparisons between\\ncumulative frequency measures in clinical trials, limited attention has been\\ngiven to regression methods that directly address time-varying effects in\\nwhile-alive measures for composite survival outcomes. Motivated by an\\nindividually randomized trial (HF-ACTION) and a cluster randomized trial\\n(STRIDE), we address this gap by developing a regression framework for\\nwhile-alive measures for composite survival outcomes that include a terminal\\ncomponent event. Our regression approach uses splines to model time-varying\\nassociation between covariates and a while-alive loss rate of all component\\nevents, and can be applied to both independent and clustered data. We derive\\nthe asymptotic properties of the regression estimator in each setting and\\nevaluate its performance through simulations. Finally, we apply our regression\\nmethod to analyze data from the HF-ACTION individually randomized trial and the\\nSTRIDE cluster randomized trial. The proposed methods are implemented in the\\nWAreg R package.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:54:47Z\"}"}
