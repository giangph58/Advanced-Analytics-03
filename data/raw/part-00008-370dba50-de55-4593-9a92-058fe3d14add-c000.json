{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00641v1\", \"title\": \"Expected First Return Times for Random Walks on Toroidal and Bounded\\n  Grids\", \"summary\": \"We consider random walks on an $n \\\\times n$ grid with opposite edges\\nidentified, forming a two-dimensional torus with $(n-1)^2$ unique states. We\\nprove that, starting from any fixed state (e.g., the origin), the expected\\nfirst return time is exactly $(n-1)^2$.\\n  Our proof generalizes naturally to rectangular grids of size $n \\\\times m$,\\nwhere the expected first return time becomes $(n-1)(m-1)$. More broadly, we\\nextend the argument to $d$-dimensional toroidal grids of size $n_1 \\\\times n_2\\n\\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times n_d$, where the expected first return time is $n_1 n_2\\n\\\\cdots n_d $. We also discuss the problem under alternative boundary\\nconditions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T16:30:55Z\"}"}
