{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13006v1\", \"title\": \"Mathematical programs with complementarity constraints and application\\n  to hyperparameter tuning for nonlinear support vector machines\", \"summary\": \"We consider the Mathematical Program with Complementarity Constraints (MPCC).\\nOne of the main challenges in solving this problem is the systematic failure of\\nstandard Constraint Qualifications (CQs). Carefully accounting for the\\ncombinatorial nature of the complementarity constraints, tractable versions of\\nthe Mangasarian Fromovitz Constraint Qualification (MFCQ) have been designed\\nand widely studied in the literature. This paper looks closely at two such\\nMPCC-MFCQs and their influence on MPCC algorithms. As a key contribution, we\\nprove the convergence of the sequential penalisation and Scholtes relaxation\\nalgorithms under a relaxed MPCC-MFCQ that is much weaker than the CQs currently\\nused in the literature. We then form the problem of tuning hyperparameters of a\\nnonlinear Support Vector Machine (SVM), a fundamental machine learning problem\\nfor classification, as a MPCC. For this application, we establish that the\\naforementioned relaxed MPCC-MFCQ holds under a very mild assumption. Moreover,\\nwe program robust implementations and comprehensive numerical experimentation\\non real-world data sets, where we show that the sequential penalisation method\\napplied to the MPCC formulation for tuning SVM hyperparameters can outperform\\nboth the Scholtes relaxation technique and the state-of-the-art derivative-free\\nmethods from the machine learning literature.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T15:15:34Z\"}"}
