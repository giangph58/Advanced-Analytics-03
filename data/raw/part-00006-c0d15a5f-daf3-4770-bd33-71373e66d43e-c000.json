In recent years, the field of haptic interaction has witnessed\\nsignificant advancements, particularly in the area of electrical haptic\\nfeedback, driving innovation across various domains. To gain a comprehensive\\nunderstanding of the current state of research and the latest developments in\\nelectrical haptic interaction, this study systematically reviews the literature\\nin this area. Our investigation covers key aspects including haptic devices,\\nhaptic perception mechanisms, the comparison and integration of electrical\\nhaptic feedback with other feedback modalities, and their diverse applications.\\nSpecifically, we conduct a systematic analysis of 110 research papers to\\nexplore the forefront of electrical haptic feedback, providing insights into\\nits latest trends, challenges, and future directions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T09:57:33Z\"}"}
