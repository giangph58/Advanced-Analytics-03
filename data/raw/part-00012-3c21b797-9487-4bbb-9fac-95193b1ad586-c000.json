{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20459v1\", \"title\": \"SAS-Prompt: Large Language Models as Numerical Optimizers for Robot\\n  Self-Improvement\", \"summary\": \"We demonstrate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform\\niterative self-improvement of robot policies. An important insight of this\\npaper is that LLMs have a built-in ability to perform (stochastic) numerical\\noptimization and that this property can be leveraged for explainable robot\\npolicy search. Based on this insight, we introduce the SAS Prompt (Summarize,\\nAnalyze, Synthesize) -- a single prompt that enables iterative learning and\\nadaptation of robot behavior by combining the LLM's ability to retrieve, reason\\nand optimize over previous robot traces in order to synthesize new, unseen\\nbehavior. Our approach can be regarded as an early example of a new family of\\nexplainable policy search methods that are entirely implemented within an LLM.\\nWe evaluate our approach both in simulation and on a real-robot table tennis\\ntask.
