In this letter, we investigate an RA-enabled secure communication\\nsystem where confidential information is transmitted from an RA-based access\\npoint (AP) to a single-antenna legitimate user in the presence of multiple\\neavesdroppers. We aim to maximize the achievable secrecy rate by jointly\\noptimizing the transmit beamforming and the deflection angles of all RAs.\\nAccordingly, we propose an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to\\nobtain a high-quality suboptimal solution in an iterative manner, where the\\ngeneralized Rayleigh quotient-based beamforming is applied and the RAs'\\ndeflection angles are optimized by the successive convex approximation (SCA).\\nSimulation results show that the proposed RA-enabled secure communication\\nsystem achieves significant improvement in achievable secrecy rate as compared\\nto various benchmark schemes.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:55:27Z\"}"}
