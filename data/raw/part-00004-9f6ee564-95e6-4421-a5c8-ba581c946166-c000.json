Applying gravitational positivity bounds with dark matter forward\\nscattering process $\\\\phi \\\\phi \\\\to \\\\phi \\\\phi$ to this DM model, we find that the\\nnew physics, besides the Higgs-portal dark matter physics, arises at an energy\\nscale lower than $10^{10}$ GeV without the dark matter self-coupling. With the\\nexistence of the dark matter self-coupling, the hierarchical order of magnitude\\nbetween the self-coupling $\\\\lambda_{\\\\phi}$ and the Higgs-portal coupling\\n$\\\\lambda_{h\\\\phi}$ changes the game. With $\\\\lambda_{\\\\phi}/\\\\lambda_{h\\\\phi} =\\n10^{12}$, the GUT scale cutoff can realize. In this case, the dark freezeout\\nscenario is possible for realizing the relic density of dark matter in the\\nUniverse. We find that $\\\\lambda_{\\\\phi} \\\\sim O(1)$, $\\\\lambda_{h\\\\phi} \\\\sim\\n10^{-12}$, and sub-GeV dark matter is implicated for the GUT scale cutoff\\npossibility with the Higgs-portal dark matter model.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T08:49:36Z\"}"}
