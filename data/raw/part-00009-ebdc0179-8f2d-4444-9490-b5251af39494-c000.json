{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12021v1\", \"title\": \"Action Anticipation from SoccerNet Football Video Broadcasts\", \"summary\": \"Artificial intelligence has revolutionized the way we analyze sports videos,\\nwhether to understand the actions of games in long untrimmed videos or to\\nanticipate the player's motion in future frames. Despite these efforts, little\\nattention has been given to anticipating game actions before they occur. In\\nthis work, we introduce the task of action anticipation for football broadcast\\nvideos, which consists in predicting future actions in unobserved future\\nframes, within a five- or ten-second anticipation window. To benchmark this\\ntask, we release a new dataset, namely the SoccerNet Ball Action Anticipation\\ndataset, based on SoccerNet Ball Action Spotting. Additionally, we propose a\\nFootball Action ANticipation TRAnsformer (FAANTRA), a baseline method that\\nadapts FUTR, a state-of-the-art action anticipation model, to predict\\nball-related actions. To evaluate action anticipation, we introduce new\\nmetrics, including mAP@$\\\\delta$, which evaluates the temporal precision of\\npredicted future actions, as well as mAP@$\\\\infty$, which evaluates their\\noccurrence within the anticipation window. We also conduct extensive ablation\\nstudies to examine the impact of various task settings, input configurations,\\nand model architectures. Experimental results highlight both the feasibility\\nand challenges of action anticipation in football videos, providing valuable\\ninsights into the design of predictive models for sports analytics. By\\nforecasting actions before they unfold, our work will enable applications in\\nautomated broadcasting, tactical analysis, and player decision-making. Our\\ndataset and code are publicly available at\\nhttps://github.com/MohamadDalal/FAANTRA.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T12:24:33Z\"}"}
