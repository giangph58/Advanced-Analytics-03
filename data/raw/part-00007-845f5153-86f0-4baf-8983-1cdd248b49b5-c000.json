Existing results\\nthat hold on the imaginary axis are extended to the complex plane, without\\nreliance on a simultaneous diagonalizability assumption that is ubiquitous in\\nthe literature. Therefore, the results remain valid even when line symmetry\\nbreaks down, as in the case of electrical faults. The system-theoretic\\nproperties established here are of general relevance to control, power systems,\\nand signal processing involving multiconductor transmission lines.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:06:02Z\"}"}
