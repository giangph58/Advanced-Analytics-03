We derive the variational formulas\\nfor the determinant of the Laplacian, ${\\\\rm det}\\\\,\\\\Delta^m$, on $X$ under\\ninfinitesimal variations of the positions of the conical points and the conical\\nangles (i. e. infinitesimal variations of $X$ in the class of polyhedra with\\nthe same number of vertices). Besides having an independent interest, this\\nderivation may serve as a somewhat belated mathematical counterpart of the\\nwell-known heuristic calculation of ${\\\\rm det}\\\\,\\\\Delta^m$ performed by Aurell\\nand Salomonson in the 90-s.\", \"main_category\": \"math.SP\", \"categories\": \"math.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:22:04Z\"}"}
