HDM is a model that incorporates pixel-level\\noperations while maintaining the same training process as DDPM. In HDM, the\\ndiscrete form of the two-dimensional heat equation is integrated into the\\ndiffusion and generation formulas of DDPM, enabling the model to compute\\nrelationships between neighboring pixels during image processing. Our\\nexperiments demonstrate that HDM can generate higher-quality samples compared\\nto models such as DDPM, Consistency Diffusion Models (CDM), Latent Diffusion\\nModels (LDM), and Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Networks (VQGAN).\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T09:03:33Z\"}"}
