However, the\\nintrinsic heterogeneity across modalities (e.g., 4D spatiotemporal fMRI\\ndynamics vs. 3D anatomical sMRI structure) presents critical challenges for\\ndiscriminative feature fusion. To bridge this gap, we propose M2M-AlignNet: a\\ngeometry-aware multimodal co-attention network with latent alignment for early\\nAD diagnosis using sMRI and fMRI. At the core of our approach is a\\nmulti-patch-to-multi-patch (M2M) contrastive loss function that quantifies and\\nreduces representational discrepancies via geometry-weighted patch\\ncorrespondence, explicitly aligning fMRI components across brain regions with\\ntheir sMRI structural substrates without one-to-one constraints. Additionally,\\nwe propose a latent-as-query co-attention module to autonomously discover\\nfusion patterns, circumventing modality prioritization biases while minimizing\\nfeature redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments to confirm the\\neffectiveness of our method and highlight the correspondance between fMRI and\\nsMRI as AD biomarkers.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MM\", \"categories\": \"cs.MM,cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:18:55Z\"}"}
