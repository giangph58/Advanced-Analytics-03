A number of recently popular\\nByzantine-fault-tolerant (BFT) protocols first construct a directed acyclic\\ngraph (DAG) that partially orders transactions, then linearize the DAG into a\\nblockchain that totally orders transactions. The definitions and correctness\\nproofs of these DAG-based protocols typically assume that the set of\\nparticipants is fixed, which is impractical in long-lived blockchains.\\nAdditionally, only a few of those proofs have been machine-checked, uncovering\\nerrors in some published proofs. We developed a formal model of a DAG-based BFT\\nprotocol with dynamic stake, where participants can join and leave at every\\nblock, with stake used to weigh decisions in the protocol. We formally proved\\nthat blockchains never fork in the model, also clarifying how BFT bounds on\\nfaulty participants generalize to these highly dynamic sets of participants.\\nOur model and proofs are formalized in the ACL2 theorem prover, apply to\\narbitrarily long executions and arbitrarily large system states, and are\\nverified in 1 minute by ACL2.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LO\", \"categories\": \"cs.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T16:22:55Z\"}"}
