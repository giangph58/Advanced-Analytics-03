{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17687v1\", \"title\": \"The Igusa Zeta function of restricted power series over $\\\\mathbb{Q}_p$\", \"summary\": \"In this article, we ask whether the Igusa zeta function of a restricted power\\nseries over $\\\\mathbb{Q}_p$ can be determined solely from the terms of degree at\\nmost $D$. That is, we ask whether the truncated polynomial $f_D$, consisting of\\nall terms of f of degree $\\\\leq D$, yields the same Igusa zeta function as $f$\\nfor sufficiently large $D$. Our main results include a counterexample already\\nin the one-variable case, but also a positive result under the condition that\\n$f$ is sufficiently non-degenerate with respect to its Newton polyhedron\\n$\\\\Gamma(f)$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:57:59Z\"}"}
