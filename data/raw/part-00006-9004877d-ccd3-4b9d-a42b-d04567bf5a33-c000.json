{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21604v1\", \"title\": \"Robust Misinformation Detection by Visiting Potential Commonsense\\n  Conflict\", \"summary\": \"The development of Internet technology has led to an increased prevalence of\\nmisinformation, causing severe negative effects across diverse domains. To\\nmitigate this challenge, Misinformation Detection (MD), aiming to detect online\\nmisinformation automatically, emerges as a rapidly growing research topic in\\nthe community. In this paper, we propose a novel plug-and-play augmentation\\nmethod for the MD task, namely Misinformation Detection with Potential\\nCommonsense Conflict (MD-PCC). We take inspiration from the prior studies\\nindicating that fake articles are more likely to involve commonsense conflict.\\nAccordingly, we construct commonsense expressions for articles, serving to\\nexpress potential commonsense conflicts inferred by the difference between\\nextracted commonsense triplet and golden ones inferred by the well-established\\ncommonsense reasoning tool COMET. These expressions are then specified for each\\narticle as augmentation. Any specific MD methods can be then trained on those\\ncommonsense-augmented articles. Besides, we also collect a novel\\ncommonsense-oriented dataset named CoMis, whose all fake articles are caused by\\ncommonsense conflict. We integrate MD-PCC with various existing MD backbones\\nand compare them across both 4 public benchmark datasets and CoMis. Empirical\\nresults demonstrate that MD-PCC can consistently outperform the existing MD\\nbaselines.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T13:03:17Z\"}"}
