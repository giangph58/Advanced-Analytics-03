The\\nproposed architecture addresses the crucial issues of patient consent, data\\nsecurity, and investing trust in healthcare by integrating Ethereum blockchain\\nwith cloud computing. Our blockchain-based consent application simplifies\\npatient consent's secure and transparent management. We explain the smart\\ncontract mechanisms and privacy measures employed, ensuring data protection\\nwhile permitting controlled data sharing among authorized parties. This work\\ndemonstrates the potential of combining blockchain and cloud technologies in\\nhealthcare, emphasizing their role in maintaining data integrity, with\\nimplications for computer science and healthcare innovation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T12:31:37Z\"}"}
