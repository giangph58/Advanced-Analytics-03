{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19822v1\", \"title\": \"Mj\\u00f6lnir: A Deep Learning Parametrization Framework for Global\\n  Lightning Flash Density\", \"summary\": \"Recent advances in AI-based weather forecasting models, such as FourCastNet,\\nPangu-Weather, and GraphCast, have demonstrated the remarkable ability of deep\\nlearning to emulate complex atmospheric dynamics. Building on this momentum, we\\npropose Mj\\\\\\\"olnir, a novel deep learning-based framework for global lightning\\nflash density parameterization. Trained on ERA5 atmospheric predictors and\\nWorld Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) observations at a daily temporal\\nresolution and 1 degree spatial resolution, Mj\\\\\\\"olnir captures the nonlinear\\nmapping between large-scale environmental conditions and lightning activity.\\nThe model architecture is based on the InceptionNeXt backbone with SENet, and a\\nmulti-task learning strategy to simultaneously predict lightning occurrence and\\nmagnitude. Extensive evaluations yield that Mollnir accurately reproduces the\\nglobal distribution, seasonal variability, and regional characteristics of\\nlightning activity, achieving a global Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.96\\nfor annual mean fields. These results suggest that Mj\\\\\\\"olnir serves not only as\\nan effective data-driven global lightning parameterization but also as a\\npromising AI-based scheme for next-generation Earth system models (AI-ESMs).\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.CV,physics.ao-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:22:59Z\"}"}
