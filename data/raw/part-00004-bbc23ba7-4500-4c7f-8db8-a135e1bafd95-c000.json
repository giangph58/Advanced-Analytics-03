After separating the variables, we get\\nthe system of two differential equations for angular functions and the system\\nof four differential equations for radial functions. Solutions of the angular\\nequations give the NUT charge-dependent quantization rule for the angular\\nseparation constant. As a result of studying the radial equations, the effects\\nof NUT charge are described analytically in the particle-antiparticle\\nproduction on the outer horizon. Also the scattering resonances with imaginary\\nenergies are found for the massless fermion. The particular case of extremal\\nNUT black hole with a single horizon, when the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy\\nvanishes identically, is considered.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T17:07:32Z\"}"}
