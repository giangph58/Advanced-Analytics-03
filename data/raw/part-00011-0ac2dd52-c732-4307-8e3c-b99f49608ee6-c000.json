{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05694v1\", \"title\": \"Large Language Models Enhanced Hyperbolic Space Recommender Systems\", \"summary\": \"Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention in\\nrecommender systems for their excellent world knowledge capabilities. However,\\nexisting methods that rely on Euclidean space struggle to capture the rich\\nhierarchical information inherent in textual and semantic data, which is\\nessential for capturing user preferences. The geometric properties of\\nhyperbolic space offer a promising solution to address this issue.\\nNevertheless, integrating LLMs-based methods with hyperbolic space to\\neffectively extract and incorporate diverse hierarchical information is\\nnon-trivial. To this end, we propose a model-agnostic framework, named\\nHyperLLM, which extracts and integrates hierarchical information from both\\nstructural and semantic perspectives. Structurally, HyperLLM uses LLMs to\\ngenerate multi-level classification tags with hierarchical parent-child\\nrelationships for each item. Then, tag-item and user-item interactions are\\njointly learned and aligned through contrastive learning, thereby providing the\\nmodel with clear hierarchical information. Semantically, HyperLLM introduces a\\nnovel meta-optimized strategy to extract hierarchical information from semantic\\nembeddings and bridge the gap between the semantic and collaborative spaces for\\nseamless integration. Extensive experiments show that HyperLLM significantly\\noutperforms recommender systems based on hyperbolic space and LLMs, achieving\\nperformance improvements of over 40%. Furthermore, HyperLLM not only improves\\nrecommender performance but also enhances training stability, highlighting the\\ncritical role of hierarchical information in recommender systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T05:35:38Z\"}"}
