{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15786v1\", \"title\": \"Satellite to GroundScape -- Large-scale Consistent Ground View\\n  Generation from Satellite Views\", \"summary\": \"Generating consistent ground-view images from satellite imagery is\\nchallenging, primarily due to the large discrepancies in viewing angles and\\nresolution between satellite and ground-level domains. Previous efforts mainly\\nconcentrated on single-view generation, often resulting in inconsistencies\\nacross neighboring ground views. In this work, we propose a novel cross-view\\nsynthesis approach designed to overcome these challenges by ensuring\\nconsistency across ground-view images generated from satellite views. Our\\nmethod, based on a fixed latent diffusion model, introduces two conditioning\\nmodules: satellite-guided denoising, which extracts high-level scene layout to\\nguide the denoising process, and satellite-temporal denoising, which captures\\ncamera motion to maintain consistency across multiple generated views. We\\nfurther contribute a large-scale satellite-ground dataset containing over\\n100,000 perspective pairs to facilitate extensive ground scene or video\\ngeneration. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms\\nexisting methods on perceptual and temporal metrics, achieving high\\nphotorealism and consistency in multi-view outputs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T10:58:42Z\"}"}
