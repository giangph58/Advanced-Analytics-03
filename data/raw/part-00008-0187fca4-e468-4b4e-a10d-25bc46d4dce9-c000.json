However, a comprehensive study of the magnetic,\\nthermodynamic, and transport properties of single-crystalline NdGaSi, guided by\\nfirst-principles calculations, reveals a ferromagnetic ground state that\\ninduces a splitting of quasi-flat 4$\\\\textit{f}$-electronic bands and positions\\nthem near the Fermi energy. The observation of an extraordinarily large\\nintrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity of 1165 $\\\\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$ implies\\nthe direct involvement of localized states in the generation of non-trivial\\nband crossings around the Fermi energy. These results are remarkable when\\ncompared to ferrimagnetic NdAlSi, which differs only in a non-magnetic atom (a\\nchange in the principal quantum number $\\\\textit{n}$ of the outer $\\\\textit{p}$\\norbital) with the same number of valence electrons and does not exhibit any\\nmeasurable anomalous Hall conductivity.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T09:30:23Z\"}"}
