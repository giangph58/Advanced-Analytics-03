Here, we show that the notion of altermagnetism extends beyond the\\nrealm of Landau-type order: we study exactly solvable $\\\\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum\\nspin(-orbital) liquids (QSL), which simultaneously support magnetic long-range\\norder as well as fractionalization and $\\\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. Our\\nsymmetry analysis reveals that in this model three distinct types of\\n``fractionalized altermagnets (AM$^*$)'' may emerge, which can be distinguished\\nby their residual symmetries. Importantly, the fractionalized excitations of\\nthese states carry an emergent $\\\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charge, which implies that\\nthey transform \\\\emph{projectively} under symmetry operations. Consequently, we\\nshow that ``altermagnetic spin splittings'' are now encoded in a\\nmomentum-dependent particle-hole asymmetry of the fermionic parton bands. We\\ndiscuss consequences for experimental observables such as dynamical spin\\nstructure factors and (nonlinear) thermal and spin transport.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T17:59:01Z\"}"}
