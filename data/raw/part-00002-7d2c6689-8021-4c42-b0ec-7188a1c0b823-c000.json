We develop a state-of-the-art dust synthesis\\ncode by self-consistently solving molecule and dust formation in supernova (SN)\\nejecta that contain various elements in different layers. With a progenitor\\nmass 25 Msun and explosion energy 10^{52} erg, we run the following four test\\ncalculations to investigate the impact of input physics. (i) With molecule\\nformation solved, our SN model produces 8.45x10^{-2} Msun carbonaceous grains.\\n(ii) If all available C and Si were initially depleted into CO and SiO\\nmolecules, respectively, the C grain mass could be underestimated by ~40%. In\\nthese two models producing 0.07 Msun 56Ni without mixing fallback, a large\\namount of silicates (0.260 Msun) created in O-rich layers are also ejected and\\nlikely to hide the spectral feature of carbonaceous grains. We then consider\\nmixing-fallback that can reproduce the observed elemental abundance ratios of\\nC-normal and C-enhanced extremely metal-poor stars in the Milky Way. (iii) In\\nthe former, the mass ratio of carbonaceous to silicate grains is still small\\n(~0.3). However, (iv) in the latter (known as a ``faint SN'), while the C grain\\nmass is unchanged (6.78x10^{-2} Msun), the silicate mass is reduced\\n(9.98x10^{-3} Msun). Therefore, we conclude that faint SNe can be a significant\\ncarbonaceous dust factory in the early Universe.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T12:49:49Z\"}"}
