{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17737v1\", \"title\": \"Modularity of tadpole Nahm sums in ranks 4 and 5\", \"summary\": \"Around 2016, Calinescu, Milas and Penn conjectured that the rank $r$ Nahm sum\\nassociated with the $r\\\\times r$ tadpole Cartan matrix is modular, and they\\nprovided a proof for $r=2$. The $r=3$ case was recently resolved by Milas and\\nWang. We prove this conjecture for the next cases $r=4,5$. We also prove the\\nmodularity of some companion Nahm sums by establishing the corresponding\\nRogers--Ramanujan type identities. A key new ingredient in our proofs is some\\nrank reduction formulas which allow us to decompose higher rank tadpole Nahm\\nsums to mixed products of some lower rank Nahm-type sums and theta functions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT,math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T16:49:38Z\"}"}
