Using the\\nFast Fourier Transform (FFT), the collected signal is transformed to the\\nfrequency domain and then goes through the processing steps of this algorithm.\\nHowever, when it comes to large datasets, this process can be computationally\\nexpensive. This paper explores the implementation of a Quantum Range Doppler\\nAlgorithm (QRDA), relying on the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) as a speedup\\ntool over the classical FFT. Additionally, it proposes a quantum version of the\\nRange Cell Migration Correction (RCMC) in the Fourier domain, one of the key\\ncorrectional steps of the RDA algorithm, and compares it with its classical\\ncounterpart.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:40:12Z\"}"}
