Under any ergodic boundary condition it is\\nknown that the mixing time of the chain in a box of side $L$ is $\\\\Theta(L)$ for\\nany $d\\\\ge 1$. Moreover, with minimal boundary conditions and at low\\ntemperature, i.e. low equilibrium density of the facilitating vertices, the\\nchain exhibits cutoff around the mixing time of the $d=1$ case. Here we extend\\nthis result to high temperature. As in the low temperature case, the key tool\\nis to prove that the speed of infection propagation in the $(1,1,\\\\dots,1)$\\ndirection is larger than $d$ $\\\\times$ the same speed along a coordinate\\ndirection. By borrowing a technique from first passage percolation, the proof\\nlinks the result to the precise value of the critical probability of oriented\\n(bond or site) percolation in $\\\\mathbb Z^d$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T07:42:29Z\"}"}
