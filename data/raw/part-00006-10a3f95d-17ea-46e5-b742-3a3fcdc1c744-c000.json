Recently there has been interest in breast MRI as an adjunct to\\nmammography, as this modality provides an orthogonal and highly quantitative\\nassessment of breast tissue. However, its 3D nature poses analytic challenges\\nrelated to delineating and aggregating complex structures across slices. Here,\\nwe applied an in-house machine-learning algorithm to assess breast density on\\nnormal breasts in three MRI datasets. Breast density was consistent across\\ndifferent datasets (0.104 - 0.114). Analysis across different age groups also\\ndemonstrated strong consistency across datasets and confirmed a trend of\\ndecreasing density with age as reported in previous studies. MR breast density\\nwas correlated with mammographic breast density, although some notable\\ndifferences suggest that certain breast density components are captured only on\\nMRI. Future work will determine how to integrate MR breast density with current\\ntools to improve future breast cancer risk prediction.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T16:01:51Z\"}"}
