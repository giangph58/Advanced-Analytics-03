{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03278v1\", \"title\": \"The Rayleigh-Taylor instability with local energy dissipation\", \"summary\": \"We consider the inhomogeneous incompressible Euler equations including their\\nlocal energy inequality as a differential inclusion. Providing a corresponding\\nconvex integration theorem and constructing subsolutions, we show the existence\\nof locally dissipative Euler flows emanating from the horizontally flat\\nRayleigh-Taylor configuration and having a mixing zone which grows\\nquadratically in time. For the Rayleigh-Taylor instability these are the first\\nturbulently mixing solutions known to respect local energy dissipation, and\\noutside the range of Atwood numbers considered in arXiv:2002.08843, the first\\nweakly admissible solutions in general. In the coarse grained picture the\\nexistence relies on one-dimensional subsolutions described by a family of\\nhyperbolic conservation laws, among which one can find the optimal background\\nprofile appearing in the scale invariant bounds from arXiv:2303.01889, and as\\nwe show, the optimal conservation law with respect to maximization of the total\\nenergy dissipation.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:06:31Z\"}"}
