We derive the distribution of\\nexclusive fermions via the employment of the grand canonical ensemble. Salient\\nfeatures of its statistical properties, compared to the free electron gases,\\ninclude: larger Fermi energy, higher degeneracy pressure, but the same Pauli\\nparamagnetism and Landau diamagnetism. In particular, higher degeneracy\\npressure leads to an inflation of the Chandrasekhar limit to 1.6 times when\\napplied to white dwarf stars and neutron stars.\", \"main_category\": \"math-ph\", \"categories\": \"math-ph,astro-ph.SR,cond-mat.stat-mech,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T08:08:57Z\"}"}
