{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01846v1\", \"title\": \"Many neighbors little entanglement: A curious scaling in the\\n  variable-range extended Ising model\", \"summary\": \"We study the two-point correlation functions and the bipartite entanglement\\nin the ground state of the exactly-solvable variable-range extended Ising model\\nof qubits in the presence of a transverse field on a one-dimensional lattice.\\nWe introduce the variation in the range of interaction by varying the\\ncoordination number, $\\\\mathcal{Z}$, of each qubit, where the interaction\\nstrength between a pair of qubits at a distance $r$ varies as $\\\\sim\\nr^{-\\\\alpha}$. We show that the algebraic nature of the correlation functions is\\npresent only up to $r=\\\\mathcal{Z}$, above which it exhibits short-range\\nexponential scaling. We also show that at the critical point, the bipartite\\nentanglement exhibits a power-law decrease ($\\\\sim\\\\mathcal{Z}^{-\\\\gamma}$) with\\nincreasing coordination number irrespective of the partition size and the value\\nof $\\\\alpha$ for $\\\\alpha>1$. We further consider a sudden quench of the system\\nstarting from the ground state of the infinite-field limit of the system\\nHamiltonian via turning on the critical Hamiltonian, and demonstrate that the\\nlong-time averaged bipartite entanglement exhibits a qualitatively similar\\nvariation ($\\\\sim\\\\mathcal{Z}^{-\\\\gamma}$) with $\\\\mathcal{Z}$.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:54:52Z\"}"}
