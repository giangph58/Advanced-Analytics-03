This paper studies the problem of\\nleveraging pretrained diffusion models for performing discriminative tasks.\\nSpecifically, we extend the discriminative capability of pretrained frozen\\ngenerative diffusion models from the classification task to the more complex\\nobject detection task, by \\\"inverting\\\" a pretrained layout-to-image diffusion\\nmodel. To this end, a gradient-based discrete optimization approach for\\nreplacing the heavy prediction enumeration process, and a prior distribution\\nmodel for making more accurate use of the Bayes' rule, are proposed\\nrespectively. Empirical results show that this method is on par with basic\\ndiscriminative object detection baselines on COCO dataset. In addition, our\\nmethod can greatly speed up the previous diffusion-based method for\\nclassification without sacrificing accuracy.
