In a previous joint work, we\\nestablished a variant of Hardy's inequality for the same half-space, but with\\ncertain parameter restrictions. However, all integrals in that work were\\nconsidered over half-spaces, and here the seminorm is taken over the entire\\n$\\\\mathbb{H}^n$. Although this inequality holds for all values of the quantity\\n$sp+\\\\alpha$, we are only able to compute the corresponding sharp constant when\\n$sp+\\\\alpha>1$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:03:40Z\"}"}
