{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12205v1\", \"title\": \"Barrow and Tsallis entropies after the DESI DR2 BAO data\", \"summary\": \"Modified cosmology based on Barrow entropy arises from the\\ngravity-thermodynamics conjecture, in which the standard Bekenstein-Hawking\\nentropy is replaced by the Barrow entropy of quantum-gravitational origin,\\ncharacterized by the Barrow parameter $\\\\Delta$. Interestingly, this framework\\nexhibits similarities with cosmology based on Tsallis $\\\\delta$-entropy, which,\\nalthough rooted in a non-extensive generalization of Boltzmann-Gibbs\\nstatistics, features the same power-law deformation of the holographic scaling\\npresent in the Barrow case. We use observational data from Supernova Type Ia\\n(SNIa), Cosmic Chronometers (CC), and Baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO),\\nincluding the recently released DESI DR2 data, in order to extract constraints\\non such scenarios. As we show, the best-fit value for the Barrow exponent\\n$\\\\Delta$ is found to be negative, while the zero value, which corresponds to\\n$\\\\Lambda$CDM paradigm, is allowed only in the range of $2\\\\sigma $ for three out\\nof four datasets. Additionally, for the case of the SN$_{0}$+OHD+BAO dataset,\\nfor the current Hubble function we obtain a value of $H_0= 72.2_{-0.9}^{+0.9}$,\\nwhich offers an alleviation for the $H_0$ tension. Finally, by applying\\ninformation criteria such as the Akaike Information Criterion and the Bayes\\nevidence, we compare the fitting efficiency of the scenario at hand with\\n$\\\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, showing that the latter is slightly favoured.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T15:54:06Z\"}"}
