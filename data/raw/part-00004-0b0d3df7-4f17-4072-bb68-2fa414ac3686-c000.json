{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02454v1\", \"title\": \"Taylor Series-Inspired Local Structure Fitting Network for Few-shot\\n  Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation\", \"summary\": \"Few-shot point cloud semantic segmentation aims to accurately segment\\n\\\"unseen\\\" new categories in point cloud scenes using limited labeled data.\\nHowever, pretraining-based methods not only introduce excessive time overhead\\nbut also overlook the local structure representation among irregular point\\nclouds. To address these issues, we propose a pretraining-free local structure\\nfitting network for few-shot point cloud semantic segmentation, named\\nTaylorSeg. Specifically, inspired by Taylor series, we treat the local\\nstructure representation of irregular point clouds as a polynomial fitting\\nproblem and propose a novel local structure fitting convolution, called\\nTaylorConv. This convolution learns the low-order basic information and\\nhigh-order refined information of point clouds from explicit encoding of local\\ngeometric structures. Then, using TaylorConv as the basic component, we\\nconstruct two variants of TaylorSeg: a non-parametric TaylorSeg-NN and a\\nparametric TaylorSeg-PN. The former can achieve performance comparable to\\nexisting parametric models without pretraining. For the latter, we equip it\\nwith an Adaptive Push-Pull (APP) module to mitigate the feature distribution\\ndifferences between the query set and the support set. Extensive experiments\\nvalidate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Notably, under the 2-way\\n1-shot setting, TaylorSeg-PN achieves improvements of +2.28% and +4.37% mIoU on\\nthe S3DIS and ScanNet datasets respectively, compared to the previous\\nstate-of-the-art methods.
