Existing coding benchmarks are insufficient\\nas they do not reflect the context and complexity of safety-critical\\napplications. To this end, we assessed six LLMs' abilities to generate the code\\nfor three different path-planning algorithms and tested them on three maps of\\nvarious difficulties. Our results suggest that LLM-generated code presents\\nserious hazards for path planning applications and should not be applied in\\nsafety-critical contexts without rigorous testing.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T03:11:54Z\"}"}
