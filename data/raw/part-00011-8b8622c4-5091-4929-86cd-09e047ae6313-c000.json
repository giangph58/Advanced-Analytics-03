{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00396v1\", \"title\": \"Temporal coupled mode theory for high-$Q$ resonances in dielectric\\n  metasurfaces\", \"summary\": \"In this work, we propose a coupled mode theory for resonant response from\\nquasi-guided modes in periodic dielectric metasurfaces. First, we derived a\\ngeneric set of constraints imposed onto the parameters of the temporal coupled\\nmode theory by energy conservation and time-reversal symmetry in an invariant\\nform that allows for asymmetry between the coupling and decoupling\\ncoefficients. The proposed approach is applied to the problem of Fano\\nresonances induced by isolated quasi-guided modes in the regime of specular\\nreflection. Our central result is a generic formula for the line-shape of the\\nFano resonance in transmittance for the lossless metasurfaces in the framework\\nof 2D electrodynamics. We consider all possible symmetries of the metasurface\\nelementary cell and uncover the effects that the symmetry incurs on the profile\\nof the Fano resonance induced by an isolated high-$Q$ mode. It is shown that\\nthe proposed approach correctly describes the presence of robust reflection and\\ntransmission zeros in the spectra as well as the spectral signatures of bound\\nstates in the continuum. The approach is applied to uniderictionally guided\\nresonant modes in metasurfaces with an asymmetric elementary cell. It is found\\nthat the existence of such modes and the transmittance in their spectral\\nvicinity are consistent with the theoretical predictions. Furthermore, the\\ntheory predicts that a uniderictionally guided resonant mode is dual to a\\ncounter-propagating mode of a peculiar type which is coupled with the outgoing\\nwave on both sides of the metasurface but, nonetheless, exhibits only a\\nsingle-sided coupling with incident waves.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T08:32:07Z\"}"}
