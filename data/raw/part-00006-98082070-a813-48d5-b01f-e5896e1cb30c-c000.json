The trust system constructed by blockchain technology based on\\ncryptography algorithm and computing power provides a practical and powerful\\nsolution to solve the trust problem in human society. In order to make more\\nconvenient use of the characteristics of blockchain and build applications on\\nit, smart contracts appear. By defining some trigger automatic execution\\ncontracts, the application space of blockchain is expanded and the foundation\\nfor the rapid development of blockchain is laid. This is blockchain 2.0.\\nHowever, the programmability of smart contracts also introduces\\nvulnerabilities. In order to cope with the insufficient security guarantee of\\nhigh-value application networks running on blockchain 2.0 and smart contracts,\\nthis article will be represented by Ethereum to introduce the technical details\\nof understanding blockchain 2.0 and the operation principle of contract virtual\\nmachines, and explain how cryptocurrencies based on blockchain 2.0 are\\nconstructed and operated. The common security problems and solutions are also\\ndiscussed. Based on relevant research and on-chain practice, this paper\\nprovides a complete and comprehensive perspective to understanding\\ncryptocurrency technology based on blockchain 2.0 and provides a reference for\\nbuilding more secure cryptocurrency contracts.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CE\", \"categories\": \"cs.CE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T06:59:25Z\"}"}
