Set in a futuristic world where humans and machines\\ncoexist, players take on the role of a fast-food chef who must assemble food\\norders based on pseudocode instructions. By interpreting and executing these\\ninstructions correctly, players develop problem-solving skills, computational\\nthinking, and a foundational understanding of programming logic. The game\\nleverages the kitchen metaphor to teach computational thinking, using\\naffordances for an immersive VR experience.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T10:31:48Z\"}"}
