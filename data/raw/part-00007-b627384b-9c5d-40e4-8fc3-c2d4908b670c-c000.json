{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05778v1\", \"title\": \"Residual U-Net for accurate and efficient prediction of hemodynamics in\\n  two-dimensional asymmetric stenosis\", \"summary\": \"This study presents residual U-Net (U-ResNet), a deep learning surrogate\\nmodel for predicting hemodynamic fields in two-dimensional asymmetric stenotic\\nchannels at Reynolds numbers ranging from 200 to 800. By integrating residual\\nconnections with multi-scale feature extraction, U-ResNet achieves exceptional\\naccuracy while significantly reducing computational costs compared to\\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) approaches. Comprehensive evaluation against\\nU-Net, Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), and U-Net enhanced Fourier Neural\\nOperator demonstrates U-ResNet's superior performance in capturing sharp\\nhemodynamic gradients and complex flow features. Notably, U-ResNet demonstrates\\nrobust generalization to interpolated Reynolds numbers without retraining - a\\ncapability rarely achieved in existing models. The model's non-dimensional\\nformulation ensures scalability across vessel sizes and anatomical locations,\\nenhancing its applicability to diverse clinical scenarios. Statistical analysis\\nof prediction errors reveals that U-ResNet maintains substantially narrower\\nerror distributions compared to spectral methods, confirming its reliability\\nfor critical hemodynamic assessment. These advances position U-ResNet as a\\npromising tool for real-time clinical decision support, treatment planning, and\\nmedical device optimization, with future work focusing on extension to\\nthree-dimensional geometries and integration with patient-specific data.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn,physics.bio-ph,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T07:59:19Z\"}"}
