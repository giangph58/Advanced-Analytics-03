However, verifying their output distributions remains\\nchallenging. Here, we propose the infinite-temperature correlation function\\n(ITCF) as a physically meaningful observable for noisy intermediate-scale\\nquantum (NISQ) devices one that can be extracted using engineered circuits\\nrather than relying on fully random constructions. This is realized by\\nleveraging peaked quantum states whose probability distributions are sharply\\npeaked at specific outcomes due to constructive interference thus offering more\\nefficient verifiability and stronger signal observability. Rather than using\\nHaar-random states, which often yield vanishing signals through destructive\\ninterference, we construct purposefully biased quantum states using either\\nGrover-based amplitude amplification or shallow structured circuits. These\\nengineered states amplify contributions from relevant operator subspaces,\\nenabling robust detection of non-zero ITCF values that would otherwise be\\nsuppressed under random-state sampling. Our results highlight a\\nproblem-specific state preparation framework that mitigates signal loss from\\nrandom averaging and facilitates the detection of physically meaningful\\nobservables in NISQ devices. We also discuss future extensions to multi-qubit\\nobservables, scrambling diagnostics, and variational circuit optimization,\\nunderscoring the broader potential of Peaked States for quantum simulation and\\nverification.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:41:36Z\"}"}
