{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14896v1\", \"title\": \"Vector pulse magnet\", \"summary\": \"The underlying symmetry of the crystal, electronic structure, and magnetic\\nstructure manifests itself in the anisotropy of materials' properties, which is\\na central topic of the present condensed matter research. However, it demands\\nsuch a considerable effort to fill the explorable space that only a small part\\nhas been conquered. We report a vector pulse magnet (VPM) as an alternative\\nexperimental technique to control the direction of applied magnetic fields,\\nwhich may complement the conventional methods with its characteristic features.\\nThe VPM combines a conventional pulse magnet and a vector magnet. The VPM can\\ncreate vector pulsed magnetic fields and swiftly rotating pulsed magnetic\\nfields. As a demonstration, the three-dimensional magnetoresistance measurement\\nof a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite is carried out using the AC four-probe\\nmethod at 4.5 K and 6 T. The two-dimensional electronic structure of graphite\\nis visualized in the three-dimensional magnetoresistance data. One can uncover\\nthe rotational and time-reversal symmetry of materials using a VPM and a\\nvariety of measurement techniques.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T07:05:33Z\"}"}
