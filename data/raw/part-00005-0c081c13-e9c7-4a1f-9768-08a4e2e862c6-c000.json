We show that $\\\\mathbb N_0[x]^*$ is not a half-factorial monoid\\nand is not a Krull monoid, but has a structure very similar to that of Krull\\nmonoids, replacing valuations into $\\\\mathbb N_0$ with derivations into $\\\\mathbb\\nN_0$. We study ideals, chain of ideals, prime ideals and prime elements of\\n$\\\\mathbb N_0[x]^*$. Our monoid $\\\\mathbb N_0[x]^*$ is a submonoid of the\\nmultiplicative monoid of the ring $\\\\mathbb Z[x]$, which is a left module over\\nthe Weyl algebra $A_1(\\\\mathbb Z)$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AC\", \"categories\": \"math.AC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T14:56:31Z\"}"}
