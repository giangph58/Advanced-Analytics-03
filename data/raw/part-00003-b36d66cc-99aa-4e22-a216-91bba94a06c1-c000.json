We introduce a systematic\\nframework for searching codes with specified transversal groups by\\nparametrizing their logical subspaces on the Stiefel manifold and minimizing a\\ncomposite loss that enforces both the Knill-Laflamme conditions and a target\\ntransversal-group structure. Applying this method, we uncover a new $((6,2,3))$\\ncode admitting a transversal $Z\\\\bigl(\\\\tfrac{2\\\\pi}{5}\\\\bigr)$ gate (transversal\\ngroup $\\\\mathrm{C}_{10}$), the smallest known distance $3$ code supporting\\nnon-Clifford transversal gates, as well as several new $((7,2,3))$ codes\\nrealizing the binary icosahedral group $2I$. We further propose the\\n\\\\emph{Subset-Sum-Linear-Programming} (SS-LP) construction for codes with\\ntransversal \\\\emph{diagonal} gates, which dramatically shrinks the search space\\nby reducing to integer partitions subject to linear constraints. In a more\\nconstrained form, the method also applies directly to the binary-dihedral\\ngroups $\\\\mathrm{BD}_{2m}$. Specializing to $n=7$, the SS-LP method yields codes\\nfor all $\\\\mathrm{BD}_{2m}$ with $2m\\\\le 36$, including the first $((7,2,3))$\\nexamples supporting transversal $T$ gate ($\\\\mathrm{BD}_{16}$) and $\\\\sqrt{T}$\\ngate ($\\\\mathrm{BD}_{32}$), improving on the previous smallest examples\\n$((11,2,3))$ and $((19,2,3))$. Extending the SS-LP approach to $((8,2,3))$, we\\nconstruct new codes for $2m>36$, including one supporting a transversal\\n$T^{1/4}$ gate ($\\\\mathrm{BD}_{64}$). These results reveal a far richer\\nlandscape of nonadditive codes than previously recognized and underscore a\\ndeeper connection between quantum error correction and the algebraic\\nconstraints on transversal gate groups.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T15:18:33Z\"}"}
