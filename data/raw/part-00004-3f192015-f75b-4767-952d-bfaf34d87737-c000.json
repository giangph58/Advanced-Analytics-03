In this study, we introduce\\na novel machine learning method that combines Hidden Multivariate Pattern\\nanalysis with a Structured State Space Sequence model to decode cognitive\\nstrategies from electroencephalography data at the trial level. We apply this\\nmethod to a decision-making task, where participants were instructed to\\nprioritize either speed or accuracy in their responses. Our results reveal an\\nadditional cognitive operation, labeled Confirmation, which seems to occur\\npredominantly in the accuracy condition but also frequently in the speed\\ncondition. The modeled probability that this operation occurs is associated\\nwith higher probability of responding correctly as well as changes of mind, as\\nindexed by electromyography data. By successfully modeling cognitive operations\\nat the trial level, we provide empirical evidence for dynamic variability in\\ndecision strategies, challenging the assumption of homogeneous cognitive\\nprocesses within experimental conditions. Our approach shows the potential of\\nsequence modeling in cognitive neuroscience to capture trial-level variability\\nthat is obscured by aggregate analyses. The introduced method offers a new way\\nto detect and understand cognitive strategies in a data-driven manner, with\\nimplications for both theoretical research and practical applications in many\\nfields.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.NC\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.NC,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:33:02Z\"}"}
