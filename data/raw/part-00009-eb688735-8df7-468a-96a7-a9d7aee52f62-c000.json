{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14843v1\", \"title\": \"Quantitative Measures for Passive Sonar Texture Analysis\", \"summary\": \"Passive sonar signals contain complex characteristics often arising from\\nenvironmental noise, vessel machinery, and propagation effects. While\\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) perform well on passive sonar\\nclassification tasks, they can struggle with statistical variations that occur\\nin the data. To investigate this limitation, synthetic underwater acoustic\\ndatasets are generated that centered on amplitude and period variations. Two\\nmetrics are proposed to quantify and validate these characteristics in the\\ncontext of statistical and structural texture for passive sonar. These measures\\nare applied to real-world passive sonar datasets to assess texture information\\nin the signals and correlate the performances of the models. Results show that\\nCNNs underperform on statistically textured signals, but incorporating explicit\\nstatistical texture modeling yields consistent improvements. These findings\\nhighlight the importance of quantifying texture information for passive sonar\\nclassification.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.AS\", \"categories\": \"eess.AS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T03:55:49Z\"}"}
