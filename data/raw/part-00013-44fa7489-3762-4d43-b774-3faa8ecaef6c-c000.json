First, for Szpiro's\\nconjecture when the relevant elliptic curves are members of a one-parameter\\nfamily (an elliptic surface). And secondly, for the problem of giving lower\\nbounds for the greatest prime factor of polynomial values, in the case of\\nquadratic and cubic polynomials. The latter extends earlier work by the second\\nauthor for the polynomial $n^2+1$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T15:12:24Z\"}"}
