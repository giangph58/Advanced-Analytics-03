{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04586v1\", \"title\": \"Active Sampling for MRI-based Sequential Decision Making\", \"summary\": \"Despite the superior diagnostic capability of Magnetic Resonance Imaging\\n(MRI), its use as a Point-of-Care (PoC) device remains limited by high cost and\\ncomplexity. To enable such a future by reducing the magnetic field strength,\\none key approach will be to improve sampling strategies. Previous work has\\nshown that it is possible to make diagnostic decisions directly from k-space\\nwith fewer samples. Such work shows that single diagnostic decisions can be\\nmade, but if we aspire to see MRI as a true PoC, multiple and sequential\\ndecisions are necessary while minimizing the number of samples acquired. We\\npresent a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning framework enabling\\ncomprehensive, sequential, diagnostic evaluation from undersampled k-space\\ndata. Our approach during inference actively adapts to sequential decisions to\\noptimally sample. To achieve this, we introduce a training methodology that\\nidentifies the samples that contribute the best to each diagnostic objective\\nusing a step-wise weighting reward function. We evaluate our approach in two\\nsequential knee pathology assessment tasks: ACL sprain detection and cartilage\\nthickness loss assessment. Our framework achieves diagnostic performance\\ncompetitive with various policy-based benchmarks on disease detection, severity\\nquantification, and overall sequential diagnosis, while substantially saving\\nk-space samples. Our approach paves the way for the future of MRI as a\\ncomprehensive and affordable PoC device.
