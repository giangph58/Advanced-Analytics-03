{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12641v1\", \"title\": \"Hodge Dual Gauge Symmetry in Minimal Einstein-Aether Theory\", \"summary\": \"Einstein-aether gravity is a theory that breaks the local Lorentz symmetry by\\nintroducing a preferred direction via a vector field, which is considered to\\nplay the role of an aether. The theory is identified by four coupling constants\\nbetween the aether and gravity. Minimal Einstein-aether is the special case in\\nwhich only one of the couplings is non-zero. We show that the aether vector\\nfield in its minimal version is Hodge dual to a gauge field. The gauge symmetry\\nin the dual description has been known for decades and has been used to\\nimplement a cosmological constant into the Lagrangian. As a result, solutions\\nto the well-established gauge theory can be transferred into the minimal\\nEinstein-aether theory straightforwardly. On the other hand, some of the\\nproposed solutions to the minimal Einstein-aether theory could be discarded as\\npure gauges of the vanishing aether. We prove as a theorem that this holds true\\nfor all divergence-less aether fields.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T04:58:15Z\"}"}
