While existing approaches rely on\\nsingle-frame analysis from onboard cameras, they struggle with complex\\nscenarios involving occlusions and adverse lighting conditions. We present\\n\\\\textit{ViTLR}, a novel video-based end-to-end neural network that processes\\nmultiple consecutive frames to achieve robust traffic light detection and state\\nclassification. The architecture leverages a transformer-like design with\\nconvolutional self-attention modules, which is optimized specifically for\\ndeployment on the Rockchip RV1126 embedded platform. Extensive evaluations on\\ntwo real-world datasets demonstrate that \\\\textit{ViTLR} achieves\\nstate-of-the-art performance while maintaining real-time processing\\ncapabilities (>25 FPS) on RV1126's NPU. The system shows superior robustness\\nacross temporal stability, varying target distances, and challenging\\nenvironmental conditions compared to existing single-frame approaches. We have\\nsuccessfully integrated \\\\textit{ViTLR} into an ego-lane traffic light\\nrecognition system using HD maps for autonomous driving applications. The\\ncomplete implementation, including source code and datasets, is made publicly\\navailable to facilitate further research in this domain.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T11:27:48Z\"}"}
