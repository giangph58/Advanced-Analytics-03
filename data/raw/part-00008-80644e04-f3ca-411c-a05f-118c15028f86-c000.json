{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05230v1\", \"title\": \"Theoretical characterisation of the Barium II and Radium II ions\", \"summary\": \"Motivated by recent experimental advances, including the ongoing development\\nof an optical atomic clock in singly ionised radium, we perform a detailed\\ntheoretical characterisation of Ra+ and its lighter analogue, Ba+. Both ions\\nare of interest for precision studies, including for atomic parity violation\\nand searches for new physics beyond the standard model. Using the all-orders\\ncorrelation potential method, including Breit and radiative quantum\\nelectrodynamics corrections, we perform high-accuracy calculations of\\nelectric-dipole (E1), electric-quadrupole (E2), and magnetic-dipole (M1)\\ntransition matrix elements between the low-lying s, p, and d states of these\\nions, as well as the excited-state lifetimes, polarizabilities, magic\\nwavelengths, and magnetic dipole (A) hyperfine structure constants. By\\ncombining lifetime measurements with precise theoretical ratios, we extract\\nhigh-accuracy determinations of the s-d_1/2 and s-d_3/2 E2 matrix elements. By\\ncombining hyperfine measurements with atomic theory, we extract parameters of\\nthe nuclear magnetisation distribution (the Bohr-Weisskopf effect) for 135-,\\n137-Ba and 223-, 225-Ra. These results provide theoretical input for ongoing\\nand future experimental programs in fundamental physics and precision\\nmetrology.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:23:14Z\"}"}
