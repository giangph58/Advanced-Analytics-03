{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15269v1\", \"title\": \"Scalable and robust regression models for continuous proportional data\", \"summary\": \"Beta regression is used routinely for continuous proportional data, but it\\noften encounters practical issues such as a lack of robustness of regression\\nparameter estimates to misspecification of the beta distribution. We develop an\\nimproved class of generalized linear models starting with the continuous\\nbinomial (cobin) distribution and further extending to dispersion mixtures of\\ncobin distributions (micobin). The proposed cobin regression and micobin\\nregression models have attractive robustness, computation, and flexibility\\nproperties. A key innovation is the Kolmogorov-Gamma data augmentation scheme,\\nwhich facilitates Gibbs sampling for Bayesian computation, including in\\nhierarchical cases involving nested, longitudinal, or spatial data. We\\ndemonstrate robustness, ability to handle responses exactly at the boundary (0\\nor 1), and computational efficiency relative to beta regression in simulation\\nexperiments and through analysis of the benthic macroinvertebrate multimetric\\nindex of US lakes using lake watershed covariates.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T17:55:00Z\"}"}
