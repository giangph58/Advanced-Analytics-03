In addition to the more standard\\ntime-stepping approach we propose a space-time finite element method which\\nallows both for parallelization and adaptivity simultaneously in space and\\ntime. Numerical experiments confirm both approaches yield the same numerical\\nresults.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T11:56:42Z\"}"}
