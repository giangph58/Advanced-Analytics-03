It deals\\nwith certifying the basin of attraction of a stable equilibrium for an unknown\\ndynamical system. It is supposed that point-wise evaluation of the right-hand\\nside of the ordinary differential equation governing the system is available\\nfor a set of points in the state space. Technically, a Piecewise Affine\\nLyapunov function will be constructed iteratively using an optimisation-based\\ntechnique for the effective validation of the certificates. As a main\\ncontribution, whenever those certificates are violated locally, a refinement of\\nthe domain and the associated tessellation is produced, thus leading to an\\nimprovement in the description of the domain of attraction.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T12:52:06Z\"}"}
