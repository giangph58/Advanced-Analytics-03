{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10404v1\", \"title\": \"Framing Perception: Exploring Camera Induced Objectification in Cinema\", \"summary\": \"This study investigates how cinematographic techniques influence viewer\\nperception and contribute to the objectification of women, utilizing\\neye-tracking data from 91 participants. They watched a sexualized music video\\n(SV) known for objectifying portrayals and a non-sexualized music video (TV).\\nUsing dynamic Areas of Interests (AOIs) (head, torso, and lower body), gaze\\nmetrics such as fixation duration, visit count, and scan paths were recorded to\\nassess visual attention patterns. Participants were grouped according to their\\naverage fixations on sexualized AOIs. Statistical analyses revealed significant\\ndifferences in gaze behavior between the videos and among the groups, with\\nincreased attention to sexualized AOIs in SV. Additionally, data-driven group\\ndifferences in fixations identified specific segments with heightened\\nobjectification that are further analyzed using scan path visualization\\ntechniques. These findings provide strong empirical evidence of camera-driven\\ngaze objectification, demonstrating how cinematic framing implicitly shapes\\nobjectifying gaze patterns, highlighting the critical need for mindful media\\nrepresentation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:53:16Z\"}"}
