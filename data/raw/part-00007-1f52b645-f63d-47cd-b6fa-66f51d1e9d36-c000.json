We establish a quenched central limit theorem and identify conditions\\nunder which the associated limit variance varies continuously and\\ndifferentiably with respect to perturbations of the random dynamics. Our\\narguments rely on recent results on statistical stability and linear response\\nfor random intermittent maps established in Dragicevic et al. (J. Lond.
