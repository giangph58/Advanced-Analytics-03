Here, we report on the\\nevolution of topological magnetic textures in the proximity of other\\ntopological defects, i.e., antiferromagnetic domain walls in the topological\\ninsulator MnBi2Te4. The transition from the antiferromagnetic ground state to a\\ncanted antiferromagnetic state at finite magnetic fields is accompanied by the\\nformation of chiral bobbers - bulk-terminated topological defects adjacent to\\nthe domain walls in this system, leading to a topological proximity effect.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T13:42:05Z\"}"}
