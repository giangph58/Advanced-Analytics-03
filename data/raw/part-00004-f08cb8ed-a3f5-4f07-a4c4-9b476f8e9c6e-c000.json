{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04106v1\", \"title\": \"The Eccentricity Distribution of Warm Sub-Saturns in TESS\", \"summary\": \"We present the eccentricity distribution of warm sub-Saturns (4-8 Re, 8-200\\nday periods) as derived from an analysis of transit light curves from NASA's\\nTransiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission. We use the\\n\\\"photoeccentric\\\" effect to constrain the eccentricities of 76 planets,\\ncomprising 60 and 16 from single- and multi-transiting systems, respectively.\\nWe employ Hierarchical Bayesian Modelling to infer the eccentricity\\ndistribution of the population, testing both a Beta and Mixture Beta\\ndistribution. We identify a few highly eccentric (e ~ 0.7-0.8) warm sub-Saturns\\nwith eccentricities that appear too high to be explained by disk migration or\\nplanet-planet scattering alone, suggesting high-eccentricity migration may play\\na role in their formation. The majority of the population have a mean\\neccentricity of e = 0.103+0.047-0.045, consistent with both planet-disk and\\nplanet-planet interactions. Notably, we find that the highly eccentric\\nsub-Saturns occur in single-transiting systems. This study presents the first\\nevidence at the population level that the eccentricities of sub-Saturns may be\\nsculpted by dynamical processes.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T03:47:54Z\"}"}
