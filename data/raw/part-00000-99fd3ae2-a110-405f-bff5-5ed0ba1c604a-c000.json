Many such systems can be\\nmodeled as networks, where identifying structurally central nodes is essential\\nfor assessing their robustness and susceptibility to failure. Traditional\\ncentrality metrics often face challenges in identifying structurally important\\nnodes in networks exhibiting heterogeneity at the network scale, with\\nmultilayer networks being a prime example of such networks. These metrics\\ntypically fail to balance the trade-off between capturing local layer-specific\\nstructures and integrating global multiplex connectivity. In this study, we\\nextend DomiRank centrality, a metric that has been shown to effectively assess\\nnodal importance across diverse monoplex topologies, to multiplex networks. Our\\napproach combines layer-specific DomiRank calculations with a global\\ncontextualization step, incorporating multiplex-wide DomiRank scores to combine\\nrankings. Through synthetic and real-world network studies, we demonstrate that\\nour generalized DomiRank framework significantly improves the identification of\\nkey nodes in highly heterogeneous multiplex networks. This work advances\\ncentrality-based robustness assessments by addressing the fundamental trade-off\\nbetween layer adaptability and multiplex-wide coherence.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T09:56:36Z\"}"}
