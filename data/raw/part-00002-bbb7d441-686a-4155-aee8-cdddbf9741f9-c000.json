{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15954v1\", \"title\": \"Monocular inspection of spacecraft under illumination constraints and\\n  avoidance regions\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents an adaptive control approach to information-based\\nguidance and control of a spacecraft carrying out on-orbit inspection by\\nactively computing optimal policies for the spacecraft to achieve the best\\npossible representation of objects within its orbital environment. Due to the\\ncomplexity of navigating the space environment, it may be impossible to carry\\nout on-orbit servicing to maintain space systems like satellites using a\\nspacecraft equipped with controllers that cannot adapt to changing conditions.\\nIn particular, the presence of constraints such as illumination, field-of-view\\n(FOV), minimal fuel, the use of visual-inertial navigation for improved\\nlocalization, and the need for real-time computation of control policies render\\nthe spacecraft motion planning problem challenging. The control framework\\ndeveloped in this paper addresses these challenges by formulating the\\ninspection task as a constrained optimization problem where the goal is to\\nmaximize information gained from the cameras, while navigating to the next best\\nview, subject to illumination and FOV constraints. The developed architecture\\nis analyzed using a Lyapunov-based stability analysis and the effectiveness of\\nthe planning algorithm is verified in simulation.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T14:50:09Z\"}"}
