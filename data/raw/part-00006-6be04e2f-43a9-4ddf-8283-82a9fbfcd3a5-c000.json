{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20925v1\", \"title\": \"Chemotactic aggregation dynamics of micro-swimmers in Brinkman flows\", \"summary\": \"We study through analysis and simulations of a continuum model the collective\\nchemotactic dynamics of micro-swimmers immersed in viscous Brinkman flows. The\\nBrinkman viscous flow approximates with a resistance or friction term the\\npresence of inert impurities or stationary obstacles immersed in the fluid, an\\nenvironment that can be regarded as a wet porous medium. Analysis of the\\nlinearized system reveals that resistance primarily affects the development of\\ncollective swimming instabilities and barely affects chemotactic instabilities.\\nWe present a parameter phase space for the distinct types of dynamics we can\\nexpect in the case of auto-chemotactic bacteria-like pusher swimmers for\\nvarying medium resistance, chemotactic response strength, and hydrodynamic\\ncoupling strength values. Simulations of the full nonlinear system show that\\nresistance impacts the collective dynamics for each of these states because it\\ninhibits the hydrodynamic interactions and the emergence of the collective\\nswimmer. Surprisingly, and not expected from the linear analysis predictions,\\nwe find that resistance also hampers the chemotactic aggregation of the\\nswimmers because it impedes their ability to navigate efficiently and\\ncollectively towards chemical cues and assemble into clusters. We show\\nsimulations of the complex system for parameters sets from each of the\\nphase-space regions and quantify the observed behavior. Lastly, we discuss the\\nexperimental values of the parameters and discuss possible future experimental\\nrealizations of this system.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,physics.bio-ph,physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T16:38:41Z\"}"}
