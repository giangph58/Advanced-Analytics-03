{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10252v1\", \"title\": \"MapperEEG: A Topological Approach to Brain State Clustering in EEG\\n  Recordings\", \"summary\": \"Electrical potential scalp recordings (Electroencephalograms-EEGs) are a\\ncommon tool used to investigate brain activity. EEG is routinely used in\\nclinical applications as well as in research studies thanks to its noninvasive\\nnature, relatively inexpensive equipment, and high temporal resolution. But,\\nEEG is prone to contamination from movement artifacts and signals from external\\nsources. Thus, it requires advanced signal processing and mathematical analysis\\nmethods in tasks requiring brain state identification. Recently, tools from\\ntopological data analysis have been used successfully across many domains,\\nincluding brain research, however these uses have been limited to fMRI\\ndatasets. We introduce the topological tool MapperEEG (M-EEG) and provide an\\nexample of it's ability to separate different brain states during a simple\\nfinger tapping teaming task without any pre-labeling or prior knowledge. M-EEG\\nuses the power spectral density applied to traditional EEG frequency bands\\ncombined with the Mapper algorithm from topological data analysis to capture\\nthe underlying structure of the data and represent that structure as a graph in\\ntwo-dimensional space. This tool provides clear separation (clustering) of\\nstates during different conditions of the experiment (syncopated vs.\\nsynchronized) and we demonstrate that M-EEG outperforms other clustering\\nmethods when applied to EEG data.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GN\", \"categories\": \"math.GN\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T14:13:48Z\"}"}
