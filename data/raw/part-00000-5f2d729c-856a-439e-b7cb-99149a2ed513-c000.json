{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06629v1\", \"title\": \"Rethinking LayerNorm in Image Restoration Transformers\", \"summary\": \"This work investigates abnormal feature behaviors observed in image\\nrestoration (IR) Transformers. Specifically, we identify two critical issues:\\nfeature entropy becoming excessively small and feature magnitudes diverging up\\nto a million-fold scale. We pinpoint the root cause to the per-token\\nnormalization aspect of conventional LayerNorm, which disrupts essential\\nspatial correlations and internal feature statistics. To address this, we\\npropose a simple normalization strategy tailored for IR Transformers. Our\\napproach applies normalization across the entire spatio-channel dimension,\\neffectively preserving spatial correlations. Additionally, we introduce an\\ninput-adaptive rescaling method that aligns feature statistics to the unique\\nstatistical requirements of each input. Experimental results verify that this\\ncombined strategy effectively resolves feature divergence, significantly\\nenhancing both the stability and performance of IR Transformers across various\\nIR tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T07:06:44Z\"}"}
