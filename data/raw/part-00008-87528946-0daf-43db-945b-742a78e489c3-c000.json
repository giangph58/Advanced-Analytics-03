{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11181v1\", \"title\": \"A Quantum-Inspired Algorithm for Wave Simulation Using Tensor Networks\", \"summary\": \"We present an efficient classical algorithm based on the construction of a\\nunitary quantum circuit for simulating the Isotropic Wave Equation (IWE) in\\none, two, or three dimensions. Using an analogy with the massless Dirac\\nequation, second order time and space derivatives in the IWE are reduced to\\nfirst order, resulting in a Schr\\\\\\\"odinger equation of motion. Exact\\ndiagonalization of the unitary circuit in combination with Tensor Networks\\nallows simulation of the wave equation with a resolution of $10^{13}$ grid\\npoints on a laptop. A method for encoding arbitrary analytical functions into\\ndiagonal Matrix Product Operators is employed to prepare and evolve a Matrix\\nProduct State (MPS) encoding the solution. Since the method relies on the\\nQuantum Fourier Transform, which has been shown to generate small entanglement\\nwhen applied to arbitrary MPSs, simulating the evolution of initial conditions\\nwith sufficiently low bond dimensions to high accuracy becomes highly\\nefficient, up to the cost of Trotterized propagation and sampling of the\\nwavefunction. We conclude by discussing possible extensions of the approach for\\ncarrying out Tensor Network simulations of other partial differential equations\\nsuch as Maxwell's equations.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T13:36:08Z\"}"}
