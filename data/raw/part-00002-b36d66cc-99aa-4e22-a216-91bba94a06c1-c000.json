{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20846v1\", \"title\": \"Disjunctive and Conjunctive Normal Form Explanations of Clusters Using\\n  Auxiliary Information\", \"summary\": \"We consider generating post-hoc explanations of clusters generated from\\nvarious datasets using auxiliary information which was not used by clustering\\nalgorithms. Following terminology used in previous work, we refer to the\\nauxiliary information as tags. Our focus is on two forms of explanations,\\nnamely disjunctive form (where the explanation for a cluster consists of a set\\nof tags) and a two-clause conjunctive normal form (CNF) explanation (where the\\nexplanation consists of two sets of tags, combined through the AND operator).\\nWe use integer linear programming (ILP) as well as heuristic methods to\\ngenerate these explanations. We experiment with a variety of datasets and\\ndiscuss the insights obtained from our explanations. We also present\\nexperimental results regarding the scalability of our explanation methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,I.2\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T15:18:18Z\"}"}
