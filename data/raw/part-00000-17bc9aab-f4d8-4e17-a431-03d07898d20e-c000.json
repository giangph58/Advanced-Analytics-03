{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17764v1\", \"title\": \"Orbifolds, higher dagger structures, and idempotents\", \"summary\": \"The orbifold/condensation completion procedure of defect topological quantum\\nfield theories can be seen as carrying out a lattice or state sum model\\nconstruction internal to an ambient theory. In this paper, we propose a\\nconceptual algebraic description of orbifolds/condensations for arbitrary\\ntangential structures in terms of higher dagger structures and higher\\nidempotents. In particular, we obtain (oriented) orbifold completion from\\n(framed) condensation completion by using a general strictification procedure\\nfor higher dagger structures which we describe explicitly in low dimensions; we\\nalso discuss the spin and unoriented case. We provide several examples of\\nhigher dagger categories, such as those associated to state sum models,\\n(orbifolds of) Landau--Ginzburg models, and truncated affine Rozansky--Witten\\nmodels. We also explain how their higher dagger structures are naturally\\ninduced from rigid symmetric monoidal structures, recontextualizing and\\nextending results from the literature.\", \"main_category\": \"math.QA\", \"categories\": \"math.QA,hep-th,math-ph,math.CT,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T17:30:20Z\"}"}
