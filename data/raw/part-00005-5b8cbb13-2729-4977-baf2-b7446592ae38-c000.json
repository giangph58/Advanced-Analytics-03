In contrast to standard\\ncongestion games where agents interact in a one-shot fashion, in our model each\\nagent chooses an infinite sequence of actions and maximizes the total reward\\nstream discounted over time under different ways of computing present values.\\nOur model assumes that actions consume common resources that get congested, and\\nthe action choice by an agent affects the completion times of actions chosen by\\nother agents, which in turn affects the time rewards are accrued and their\\ndiscounted value. This is a mean-field game, where an agent's reward depends on\\nthe decisions of the other agents through the resulting action completion\\ntimes. For this type of game we define stationary equilibria, and analyze their\\nexistence and price of anarchy (PoA). Overall, we find that the PoA depends\\nentirely on the type of discounting rather than its specific parameters. For\\nexponential discounting, myopic behaviour leads to extreme inefficiency: the\\nPoA is infinity for any value of the discount parameter. For power law\\ndiscounting, such inefficiency is greatly reduced and the PoA is 2 whenever\\nstationary equilibria exist. This matches the PoA when there is no discounting\\nand players maximize long-run average rewards. Additionally, we observe that\\nexponential discounting may introduce unstable equilibria in learning\\nalgorithms, if action completion times are interdependent. In contrast, under\\nno discounting all equilibria are stable.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GT\", \"categories\": \"cs.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:53:21Z\"}"}
