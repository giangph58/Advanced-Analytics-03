{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10178v1\", \"title\": \"MSCoT: Structured Chain-of-Thought Generation for Multiple Programming\\n  Languages\", \"summary\": \"With the rapid development of code intelligence, the application of multiple\\nprogramming languages is becoming increasingly widespread. However, most\\nexisting code generation models mainly focus on a single or a few programming\\nlanguages, resulting in unsatisfactory performance in a multilingual\\nenvironment. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning can significantly improve the\\nperformance of the model without the need for retraining or fine-tuning the\\ncode generation model by reasonably decomposing complex code generation tasks\\ninto multiple subtasks and gradually deriving solutions for each subtask.\\nNevertheless, the existing CoT generation methods mainly concentrate on Python\\ncode, and the performance on other programming languages remains unclear. To\\nfill this gap, we first constructed a CoT generation dataset for 12 programming\\nlanguages through multi-agent technology. On this basis, we proposed a CoT\\ngeneration method MSCoT applicable to multiple programming languages. By\\nintroducing CoT into the code generation large model, the performance of the\\ncode generation large model in a multilingual environment can be improved.\\nThrough large-scale empirical research, we compared the generalization\\nabilities of MSCoT and the existing CoT generation methods on multiple\\nprogramming languages and proved the effectiveness of MSCoT for multiple\\nprogramming languages. In addition, we also designed a human study to prove the\\nquality of the CoT generated by MSCoT. Finally, we opensourced the model and\\ndataset of MSCoT to promote the research on CoT generation for multiple\\nprogramming languages.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T12:30:47Z\"}"}
