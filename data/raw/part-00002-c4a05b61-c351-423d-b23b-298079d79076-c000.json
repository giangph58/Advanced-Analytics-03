Two successful models\\nused for the description of the experimental measurements are the statistical\\nhadronization model and the coalescence approach. In the latter, multi-baryon\\nstates are assumed to be formed by the coalescence of baryons that are close in\\nphase-space at kinetic freeze-out. Given the collimated emission of nucleons in\\njets, the available phase-space is limited. As a result, the production of\\nnuclear states through coalescence in jets is expected to be enhanced compared\\nto production in underlying events. In this contribution, the results for the\\ncoalescence parameter $B_2$, which quantifies the formation probability of\\ndeuterons by coalescence, measured in and out of jets with the ALICE detector\\nat the Large Hadron Collider, are presented and discussed in the context of the\\ncoalescence model.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T13:11:21Z\"}"}
