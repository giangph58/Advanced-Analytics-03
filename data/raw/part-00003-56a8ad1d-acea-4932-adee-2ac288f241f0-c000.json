In this paper we investigate the emergence\\nof computational structure in a transformer-like model trained to simulate the\\nphysics of a particle system, where the transformer's attention mechanism is\\nused to transfer information between particles. We show that (a) structures\\nemerge in the attention heads of the transformer which learn to detect particle\\ncollisions, (b) the emergence of these structures is associated to degenerate\\ngeometry in the loss landscape, and (c) the dynamics of this emergence follows\\na power law. This suggests that these components are governed by a degenerate\\n\\\"effective potential\\\". These results have implications for the convergence time\\nof computational structure within neural networks and suggest that the\\nemergence of computational structure can be detected by studying the dynamics\\nof network components.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T07:38:51Z\"}"}
