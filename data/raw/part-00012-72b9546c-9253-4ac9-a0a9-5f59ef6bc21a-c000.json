For a given continuous\\npotential $\\\\phi: \\\\mathcal{A}^{\\\\mathbb{Z}^d} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\\\beta>0$\\n(``inverse temperature''), there exists a (nonempty) set of equilibrium states\\n$\\\\mathrm{ES}(\\\\beta\\\\phi)$. The potential $\\\\phi$ is said to exhibit a ``freezing\\nphase transition'' if $\\\\mathrm{ES}(\\\\beta\\\\phi) = \\\\mathrm{ES}(\\\\beta'\\\\phi)$ for\\nall $\\\\beta, \\\\beta' > \\\\beta_c$, while $\\\\mathrm{ES}(\\\\beta\\\\phi) \\\\neq\\n\\\\mathrm{ES}(\\\\beta'\\\\phi)$ for any $\\\\beta < \\\\beta_c < \\\\beta'$, where $\\\\beta_c\\\\in\\n(0,\\\\infty)$ is a critical inverse temperature depending on $\\\\phi$. In this\\npaper, given any proper subshift $X_0$ of $X$, we explicitly construct a\\ncontinuous potential $\\\\phi: X \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ for which there exists $\\\\beta_c\\n\\\\in (0,\\\\infty)$ such that $\\\\mathrm{ES}(\\\\beta\\\\phi)$ coincides with the set of\\nmeasures of maximal entropy on $X_0$ for all $\\\\beta > \\\\beta_c$, whereas for all\\n$\\\\beta < \\\\beta_c$, $\\\\mu(X_0)=0$ for all $\\\\mu\\\\in \\\\mathrm{ES}(\\\\beta\\\\phi)$. This\\nphenomenon was previously studied only for $d = 1$ in the context of dynamical\\nsystems and for restricted classes of subshifts, with significant motivation\\nstemming from quasicrystal models. Additionally, we prove that under a natural\\nsummability condition -- satisfied, for instance, by finite-range potentials or\\nexponentially decaying potentials -- freezing phase transitions are impossible.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS,math-ph,math.MP,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T15:53:11Z\"}"}
