{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04264v1\", \"title\": \"Drops can Perpetually Bounce over a Vibrating Wettable Solid\", \"summary\": \"On the surface of a vibrating liquid bath, instead of coalescing, a drop will\\ncontinually bounce on a thin film of air between the drop and the free surface,\\ngiving rise to rich chaotic dynamics and quantum analog behavior. However,\\nperpetual bouncing is yet to be demonstrated on a vibrating rigid solid, where\\nthe control of the drop's motion is not limited by the bath dynamics. Here we\\nshow that vibration of an atomically smooth mica surface prolongs a drop's\\nhovering state by several orders of magnitude, increasing the time to wet from\\nless than a second to several minutes. The excitation of the second spherical\\nharmonic mode determines a transition between a bouncing state with\\nhigh-amplitude rebounds, and a bound state, where the drop's motion is locked\\nonto the vibrating solid above a thin air layer. We further develop a coupled\\nlinear spring model, accounting for the drop's deformation, that predicts\\nbouncing trajectories without fitting parameters. Our results extend the scope\\nof bouncing drop studies beyond the liquid bath and highlight the potential for\\nprecision manipulation of small liquid quantities in air.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T09:14:02Z\"}"}
