We rigorously\\nprove that classical discrete diffusion models, which calculate per-dimension\\ntransition probabilities to avoid exponential computational cost, exhibit\\nworst-case linear scaling of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with data\\ndimension. To address this, we propose a Quantum Discrete Denoising Diffusion\\nProbabilistic Model (QD3PM), which enables joint probability learning through\\ndiffusion and denoising in exponentially large Hilbert spaces. By deriving\\nposterior states through quantum Bayes' theorem, similar to the crucial role of\\nposterior probabilities in classical diffusion models, and by learning the\\njoint probability, we establish a solid theoretical foundation for\\nquantum-enhanced diffusion models. For denoising, we design a quantum circuit\\nusing temporal information for parameter sharing and learnable\\nclassical-data-controlled rotations for encoding. Exploiting joint distribution\\nlearning, our approach enables single-step sampling from pure noise,\\neliminating iterative requirements of existing models. Simulations demonstrate\\nthe proposed model's superior accuracy in modeling complex distributions\\ncompared to factorization methods. Hence, this paper establishes a new\\ntheoretical paradigm in generative models by leveraging the quantum advantage\\nin joint distribution learning.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T11:48:21Z\"}"}
