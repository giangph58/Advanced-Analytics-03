{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04872v1\", \"title\": \"Simulating Persuasive Dialogues on Meat Reduction with Generative Agents\", \"summary\": \"Meat reduction benefits human and planetary health, but social norms keep\\nmeat central in shared meals. To date, the development of communication\\nstrategies that promote meat reduction while minimizing social costs has\\nrequired the costly involvement of human participants at each stage of the\\nprocess. We present work in progress on simulating multi-round dialogues on\\nmeat reduction between Generative Agents based on large language models (LLMs).\\nWe measure our main outcome using established psychological questionnaires\\nbased on the Theory of Planned Behavior and additionally investigate Social\\nCosts. We find evidence that our preliminary simulations produce outcomes that\\nare (i) consistent with theoretical expectations; and (ii) valid when compared\\nto data from previous studies with human participants. Generative agent-based\\nmodels are a promising tool for identifying novel communication strategies on\\nmeat reduction-tailored to highly specific participant groups-to then be tested\\nin subsequent studies with human participants.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY,cs.HC,cs.MA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T09:27:37Z\"}"}
