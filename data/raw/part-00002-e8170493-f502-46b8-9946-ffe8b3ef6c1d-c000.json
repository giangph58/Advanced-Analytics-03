{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07420v1\", \"title\": \"Emergency Communication: OTFS-Based Semantic Transmission with Diffusion\\n  Noise Suppression\", \"summary\": \"Due to their flexibility and dynamic coverage capabilities, Unmanned Aerial\\nVehicles (UAVs) have emerged as vital platforms for emergency communication in\\ndisaster-stricken areas. However, the complex channel conditions in high-speed\\nmobile scenarios significantly impact the reliability and efficiency of\\ntraditional communication systems. This paper presents an intelligent emergency\\ncommunication framework that integrates Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS)\\nmodulation, semantic communication, and a diffusion-based denoising module to\\naddress these challenges. OTFS ensures robust communication under dynamic\\nchannel conditions due to its superior anti-fading characteristics and\\nadaptability to rapidly changing environments. Semantic communication further\\nenhances transmission efficiency by focusing on key information extraction and\\nreducing data redundancy. Moreover, a diffusion-based channel denoising module\\nis proposed to leverage the gradual noise reduction process and statistical\\nnoise modeling, optimizing the accuracy of semantic information recovery.\\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution significantly\\nimproves link stability and transmission performance in high-mobility UAV\\nscenarios, achieving at least a 3dB SNR gain over existing methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T03:25:56Z\"}"}
