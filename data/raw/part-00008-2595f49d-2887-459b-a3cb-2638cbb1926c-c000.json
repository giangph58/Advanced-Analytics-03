The\\nresulting theory is a vector-tensor theory within the generalized Proca class.\\nWe then consider the static spherically symmetric solutions of this theory and\\nfind black hole solutions that acquire primary hair. Notably, one of the\\nintegration constants associated with the Proca field is not manifest in the\\noriginal metric, but under a disformal transformation of the seed solution, it\\nemerges as a second, independent primary hair. This additional hair acts as an\\neffective cosmological constant in the disformed geometry, even in the absence\\nof a bare cosmological constant term. We further generalize these black hole\\nsolutions to include electromagnetic charges and effects related to the\\nscalar-tensor counterparts of the regularized Gauss-Bonnet theory. We discuss\\nthe implications of our findings to observations.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T16:51:57Z\"}"}
