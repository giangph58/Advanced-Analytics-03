{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20951v1\", \"title\": \"Information Gravity: A Field-Theoretic Model for Token Selection in\\n  Large Language Models\", \"summary\": \"We propose a theoretical model called \\\"information gravity\\\" to describe the\\ntext generation process in large language models (LLMs). The model uses\\nphysical apparatus from field theory and spacetime geometry to formalize the\\ninteraction between user queries and the probability distribution of generated\\ntokens. A query is viewed as an object with \\\"information mass\\\" that curves the\\nsemantic space of the model, creating gravitational potential wells that\\n\\\"attract\\\" tokens during generation. This model offers a mechanism to explain\\nseveral observed phenomena in LLM behavior, including hallucinations (emerging\\nfrom low-density semantic voids), sensitivity to query formulation (due to\\nsemantic field curvature changes), and the influence of sampling temperature on\\noutput diversity.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:21:20Z\"}"}
