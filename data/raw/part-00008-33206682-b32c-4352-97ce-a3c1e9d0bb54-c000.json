{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23701v1\", \"title\": \"Topological Electronic Structure and Transport Properties of the\\n  Distorted Rutile-type WO$_2$\", \"summary\": \"We elucidate the transport properties and electronic structures of distorted\\nrutile-type WO2. Electrical resistivity and Hall effect measurements of\\nhigh-quality single crystals revealed the transport property characteristics of\\ntopological materials; these characteristics included an extremely large\\nmagnetoresistance of 13,200% (2 K and 9 T) and a very high carrier mobility of\\n25,700 cm2 V-1 s-1 (5 K). First-principles calculations revealed Dirac nodal\\nlines (DNL) near the Fermi energy in the electronic structure when spin-orbit\\ninteractions (SOIs) were absent. Although these DNLs mostly disappeared in the\\npresence of SOIs, band crossings at high-symmetry points in the reciprocal\\nspace existed as Dirac points. Furthermore, DNLs protected by nonsymmorphic\\nsymmetry persisted on the ky = {\\\\pi}/b plane. The unique transport properties\\noriginating from the topological electronic structure of chemically and\\nthermally stable WO2 could represent an opportunity to investigate the\\npotential electronic applications of the material.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T03:58:36Z\"}"}
