{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03529v1\", \"title\": \"SKALD: Scalable K-Anonymisation for Large Datasets\", \"summary\": \"Data privacy and anonymisation are critical concerns in today's data-driven\\nsociety, particularly when handling personal and sensitive user data.\\nRegulatory frameworks worldwide recommend privacy-preserving protocols such as\\nk-anonymisation to de-identify releases of tabular data. Available hardware\\nresources provide an upper bound on the maximum size of dataset that can be\\nprocessed at a time. Large datasets with sizes exceeding this upper bound must\\nbe broken up into smaller data chunks for processing. In these cases, standard\\nk-anonymisation tools such as ARX can only operate on a per-chunk basis. This\\npaper proposes SKALD, a novel algorithm for performing k-anonymisation on large\\ndatasets with limited RAM. Our SKALD algorithm offers multi-fold performance\\nimprovement over standard k-anonymisation methods by extracting and combining\\nsufficient statistics from each chunk during processing to ensure successful\\nk-anonymisation while providing better utility.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,cs.CR,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T13:38:53Z\"}"}
