Here we\\ndemonstrate such a metasurface for an advanced THz control of spins in a\\nferrimagnetic film of iron garnet. Structuring a nonmagnetic substrate one can\\nforce a THz electromagnetic field, otherwise described by plane waves, to\\nacquire an out-of-plane magnetic field and thus enable arbitrary direction of\\nthe torque acting on spins in all three dimensions. Hence, metaphotonics opens\\nup a plethora of opportunities for advanced control of spins at THz rates in\\nmany hot fields of contemporary science, including spintronics, magnonics and\\nquantum computing.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:19:35Z\"}"}
