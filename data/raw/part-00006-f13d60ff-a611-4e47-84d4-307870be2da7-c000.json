The above system can be considered as\\ndamped stochastic Navier-Stokes equations. Using the dynamic programming\\napproach, we study the infinite-dimensional second-order Hamilton-Jacobi\\nequation associated with an optimal control problem for SCBF equations. For the\\nsupercritical case, that is, $r\\\\in(3,\\\\infty)$ for $d=2$ and $r\\\\in(3,5)$ for\\n$d=3$ ($2\\\\beta\\\\mu\\\\geq 1$ for $r=3$ in $d\\\\in\\\\{2,3\\\\}$), we first prove the\\nexistence of a viscosity solution for the infinite-dimensional HJB equation,\\nwhich we identify with the value function of the associated control problem. By\\nestablishing a comparison principle for $r\\\\in(3,\\\\infty)$ and $r=3$ with\\n$2\\\\beta\\\\mu\\\\geq1$ in $d\\\\in\\\\{2,3\\\\}$, we prove that the value function is the\\nunique viscosity solution and hence we resolve the global unique solvability of\\nthe HJB equation in both two and three dimensions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T06:03:34Z\"}"}
