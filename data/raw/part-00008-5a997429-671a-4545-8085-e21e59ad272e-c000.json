Using the simple example of\\none-loop massive bubble integrals, we pose the problem of minimizing the number\\nof arithmetic operations in reducing a target integral to master integrals via\\nthe Laporta algorithm. This is a nontrivial combinatorial optimization problem\\nover the ordering of IBP equation generation (from pairs of seed integrals and\\nIBP operators) and the ordering of integral elimination. Our first proposed\\nmethod is reinforcement learning, which involves an agent interacting with an\\nenvironment in a step-by-step manner and learning the best actions to take\\ngiven an observation of the environment (in this case, the current state of the\\nIBP reduction process). The second method is using metaheuristics, e.g.\\nsimulated annealing, to minimize the computational cost as a black-box function\\nof numerical priority values that control the orderings. For large-scale\\nproblems, the number of free parameters can be compressed by using a small\\nneural network to assign priority values. Remarkably, both methods lead to IBP\\nreduction schemes that are more efficient than human-designed algorithms.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T17:14:05Z\"}"}
