{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07047v1\", \"title\": \"Hydrogen-Mediated Control of Phase Formation and Microstructure\\n  Evolution\", \"summary\": \"Hydrogen is key in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in materials production.\\nAt the same time, it significantly affects mechanical properties, often causing\\nunwanted embrittlement. However, rather than solely addressing these\\ndisadvantages, hydrogens inevitable role in sustainable metallurgy should be\\nleveraged to create new and potentially superior materials. Here, we show that\\nusing hydrogen in the form of metal hydrides introduces a barrier to mechanical\\nalloying, stabilizing otherwise unattainable microstructures. Severe plastic\\ndeformation of a composite of the high entropy alloy (HEA) TiVZrNbHf and Cu\\nleads to amorphization while substituting the HEA by its hydride preserves the\\ntwo-phase structure. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that the significantly\\ndifferent hydrogen affinities, together with the restricted dislocation motion\\nin the hydride, create a barrier to mechanical alloying. This hydride route\\nenables new microstructural states, even in well-studied material systems. It\\nopens an additional dimension in designing materials with diverging hydrogen\\naffinities, offering tighter control over mechanical alloying.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T17:05:07Z\"}"}
