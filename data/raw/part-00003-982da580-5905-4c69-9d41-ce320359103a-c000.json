The steady-state concentration and the total diffusive\\nflux onto the target are expressed in terms of the eigenvalues and\\neigenfunctions of the exterior Steklov problem. In particular, the eigenvalues\\nare shown to provide the geometric lengthscales of the target that are relevant\\nfor diffusion-controlled reactions. Using toroidal and bispherical coordinates,\\nwe propose an efficient procedure for analyzing and solving numerically this\\nspectral problem for an arbitrary torus and a pair of balls, respectively. A\\nsimple two-term approximation for the diffusive flux is established and\\nvalidated. Implications of these results in the context of chemical physics and\\nbeyond are discussed.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph,cond-mat.stat-mech,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T09:12:47Z\"}"}
