The model\\nis proven not to be universal for generating arbitrary distributions, but it is\\nsuspected that marginals can be - much like Boltzmann machines achieve\\nuniversality by utilizing hidden (traced-out in quantum jargon) layers. In this\\nshort note, we provide two simple proofs of this fact. The first is\\nnear-trivial and asymptotic, and the second shows universality can be achieved\\nwith a reasonable number of additional qubits.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:03:23Z\"}"}
