To address this issue, we develop a framework\\nfor analyzing classical capacities of quantum channels where the set of states\\nused for encoding information is restricted based on various physical\\nproperties. Specifically, we provide expressions for the classical capacities\\nof noiseless and noisy quantum channels when the average energy of the encoded\\nensemble or the energy of each of the constituent states in the ensemble is\\nbounded. In the case of qubit energy-preserving dephasing channels, we\\ndemonstrate that a nonuniform probability distribution based on the energy\\nconstraint maximizes capacity, while we derive the compact form of the capacity\\nfor equiprobable messages. We suggest an energy-constrained dense coding (DC)\\nprotocol that we prove to be optimal in the two-qubit situation and obtain a\\nclosed-form expression for the DC capacity. Additionally, we demonstrate a\\nno-go result, which states that when the dimension of the sender and the\\nreceiver is two, no energy-preserving operation can offer any quantum advantage\\nfor energy-constrained entanglement-assisted capacity. We exhibit that, in the\\nenergy-constrained situation, classical-quantum noisy channels can show\\nimproved capabilities under entanglement assistance, a phenomenon that is\\nunattainable in the unrestricted scenario.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T15:41:38Z\"}"}
