Analysing\\nover 13,000 hybrid journals between 2019-2023, the research found substantial\\ngrowth in open access due to these agreements, although most articles remain\\npaywalled. The results were consistent across all three data sources, showing\\nstrong correlations in country-level metrics despite differences in journal\\ncoverage and metadata availability. By 2023, transformative agreements enabled\\nthe majority of open access in hybrid journals, with particularly high adoption\\nin European countries. The analysis revealed strong alignment between first and\\ncorresponding authorship when measuring agreement uptake by publisher and\\ncountry. This comparative approach supports the use of open metadata for\\nlarge-scale hybrid open access studies, while using multiple data sources\\ntogether provides a more robust understanding of hybrid open access adoption\\nthan any single database can offer, overcoming individual limitations in\\ncoverage and metadata quality.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DL\", \"categories\": \"cs.DL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T11:48:39Z\"}"}
