{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20865v1\", \"title\": \"AI-GenBench: A New Ongoing Benchmark for AI-Generated Image Detection\", \"summary\": \"The rapid advancement of generative AI has revolutionized image creation,\\nenabling high-quality synthesis from text prompts while raising critical\\nchallenges for media authenticity. We present Ai-GenBench, a novel benchmark\\ndesigned to address the urgent need for robust detection of AI-generated images\\nin real-world scenarios. Unlike existing solutions that evaluate models on\\nstatic datasets, Ai-GenBench introduces a temporal evaluation framework where\\ndetection methods are incrementally trained on synthetic images, historically\\nordered by their generative models, to test their ability to generalize to new\\ngenerative models, such as the transition from GANs to diffusion models. Our\\nbenchmark focuses on high-quality, diverse visual content and overcomes key\\nlimitations of current approaches, including arbitrary dataset splits, unfair\\ncomparisons, and excessive computational demands. Ai-GenBench provides a\\ncomprehensive dataset, a standardized evaluation protocol, and accessible tools\\nfor both researchers and non-experts (e.g., journalists, fact-checkers),\\nensuring reproducibility while maintaining practical training requirements. By\\nestablishing clear evaluation rules and controlled augmentation strategies,\\nAi-GenBench enables meaningful comparison of detection methods and scalable\\nsolutions. Code and data are publicly available to ensure reproducibility and\\nto support the development of robust forensic detectors to keep pace with the\\nrise of new synthetic generators.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T15:41:13Z\"}"}
