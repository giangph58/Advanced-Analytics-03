However, it remains unclear how\\ntourism diversification occurs, what forms it can take and what it produces at\\na territorial scale. In this study, we apply a theory of regional\\ndiversification to the case of tourism in order to examine tourism\\ndiversification paths. We base our analysis on qualitative data collected on\\ntwo French study areas: the intercommunities of the massif du Sancy and of the\\nHaut-Chablais. Our results show a pattern in tourism diversification paths,\\nfollowing three steps that can lead to the abandonment of the perimeter of the\\nski resort. However, among the different types of tourism diversification\\ntrajectories, only a saltation form of tourism diversification can lead to the\\nestablishment of a larger and more diversified tourism system. Our findings\\nalso show that several types of tourism diversification paths can coexist at a\\nterritorial scale.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.RM\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.RM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T08:08:47Z\"}"}
