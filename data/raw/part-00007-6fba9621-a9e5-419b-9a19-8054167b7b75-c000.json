We investigate the\\ninterplay between correlation coefficients and Hurst exponents and propose a\\nnovel estimation method for all model parameters, establishing consistency and\\nasymptotic normality of the estimators. Additionally, we develop a\\ntime-reversibility test, which is typically not rejected by real volatility\\ndata. When the data-generating process is a time-reversible mfBm, we derive\\noptimal forecasting formulae and analyze their properties. A key insight is\\nthat an mfBm with different Hurst exponents and non-zero correlations can\\nreduce forecasting errors compared to a one-dimensional model. Consistent with\\noptimal forecasting theory, out-of-sample forecasts using the time-reversible\\nmfBm show improvements over univariate fBm, particularly when the estimated\\nHurst exponents differ significantly. Empirical results demonstrate that\\nmfBm-based forecasts outperform the (vector) HAR model.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.ST\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.ST\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T15:38:31Z\"}"}
