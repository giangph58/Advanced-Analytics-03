{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12616v1\", \"title\": \"Graph-based Path Planning with Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance for Autonomous\\n  Parking\", \"summary\": \"Safe and efficient path planning in parking scenarios presents a significant\\nchallenge due to the presence of cluttered environments filled with static and\\ndynamic obstacles. To address this, we propose a novel and computationally\\nefficient planning strategy that seamlessly integrates the predictions of\\ndynamic obstacles into the planning process, ensuring the generation of\\ncollision-free paths. Our approach builds upon the conventional Hybrid A star\\nalgorithm by introducing a time-indexed variant that explicitly accounts for\\nthe predictions of dynamic obstacles during node exploration in the graph, thus\\nenabling dynamic obstacle avoidance. We integrate the time-indexed Hybrid A\\nstar algorithm within an online planning framework to compute local paths at\\neach planning step, guided by an adaptively chosen intermediate goal. The\\nproposed method is validated in diverse parking scenarios, including\\nperpendicular, angled, and parallel parking. Through simulations, we showcase\\nour approach's potential in greatly improving the efficiency and safety when\\ncompared to the state of the art spline-based planning method for parking\\nsituations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T03:43:20Z\"}"}
