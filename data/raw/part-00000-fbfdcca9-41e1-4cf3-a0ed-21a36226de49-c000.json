In this work, we propose a\\nsketching-based approach to approximate Grassmannian kernels using random\\nprojections. We introduce three variations of kernel approximation, including\\ntwo that rely on binarised sketches, offering substantial memory gains. We\\nestablish theoretical properties of our method in the special case of G(1, n)\\nand extend it to general G(k, n). Experimental validation demonstrates that our\\nsketched kernels closely match the performance of standard Grassmannian kernels\\nwhile avoiding the need to compute or store the full kernel matrix. Our\\napproach enables scalable Grassmannian-based methods for large-scale\\napplications in machine learning and pattern recognition.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP,eess.IV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T11:28:14Z\"}"}
