The latter renders the ghost graviton an unstable\\nhigh mass resonance which renders unitarity in the spirit of Lee-Week type\\ntheories. Furthermore, if the scalar graviton is tachyonic then there will be a\\nlow energy fixed point where tachyonic condensation leads to a new stable\\nvacuum. At this fixed point the symmetry breaks and the Fermi scale emerges,\\nand the behavior of the Higgs field is classical (not influenced by\\ngravitational interaction). Gravity at the UV scale is purely quadratic whereas\\nat the Fermi scale it is linear, and in the intermediate region both\\ncontributions are relevant. Thus, at the Fermi scale the quadratic curvature\\nfields disappear through the ghost instability and tachyon condensation, giving\\nrise to Einstein gravity and the electroweak phase transition.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T15:04:47Z\"}"}
