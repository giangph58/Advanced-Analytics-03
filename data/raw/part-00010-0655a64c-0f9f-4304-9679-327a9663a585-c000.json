While traditional frameworks\\nuse autoencoders for CSI compression at the user equipment (UE) and\\nreconstruction at the network (NW) side in spatial-frequency (SF), massive\\nmultiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems in low mobility scenarios\\nexhibit strong temporal correlation alongside frequency and spatial\\ncorrelations. An autoencoder architecture alone is insufficient to exploit the\\nTSF domain correlation in CSI; a recurrent element is also required. To address\\nthe vanishing gradients problem, researchers in recent works have proposed\\nstate-of-the-art TSF domain CSI compression architectures that combine\\nrecurrent networks for temporal correlation exploitation with deep pre-trained\\nautoencoder that handle SF domain CSI compression. However, this approach\\nincreases the number of parameters and computational complexity. To jointly\\nutilize correlations across the TSF domain, we propose a novel,\\nparameter-light, low-complexity AI/ML-based recurrent autoencoder architecture\\nto compress CSI at the UE side and reconstruct it on the NW side while\\nminimizing CSI feedback overhead.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:00:59Z\"}"}
