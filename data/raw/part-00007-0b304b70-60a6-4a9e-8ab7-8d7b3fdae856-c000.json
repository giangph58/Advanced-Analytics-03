{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14997v1\", \"title\": \"Gravitational form factors of the pion in the self-consistent\\n  light-front quark model\", \"summary\": \"We present a self-consistent light-front quark model (LFQM) analysis of the\\npion's gravitational form factors (GFFs), incorporating the Bakamjian-Thomas\\n(BT) construction consistently throughout the framework. By uniformly applying\\nthe BT formalism to both hadronic matrix elements and their associated Lorentz\\nstructures, we achieve a current-component-independent extraction of the pion\\nGFFs $A_\\\\pi(t)$ and $D_\\\\pi(t)$, thereby eliminating the light-front zero-mode\\nambiguities that typically hinder conventional LFQM approaches. By tuning the\\nmodel parameters, we identify an optimal set that successfully reproduces the\\ndecay constant and electromagnetic form factor of the pion, while yielding a\\n$D$-term value $D_\\\\pi(0) \\\\approx -1$, consistent with predictions from chiral\\nperturbation theory. The $D$-term emerges as a sensitive probe of the pion's\\ninternal dynamics, governing its mechanical radius -- the largest among the\\ncharge, mass, and mechanical radii. We further examine the pion's spatial\\nstructure via its associated two-dimensional light-front densities, including\\nthe momentum density, transverse pressure, and shear stress, all of which\\nsatisfy the required normalization and von Laue stability conditions. Our\\nresults reveal a detailed mechanical landscape: a centrally peaked momentum\\ndensity that decreases monotonically; a repulsive pressure near the center (up\\nto $x_\\\\perp = 0.33$~fm) that transitions to attraction in the outer region; and\\na shear stress profile peaking at an intermediate distance ($x_\\\\perp \\\\approx\\n0.2$~fm).\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T09:53:57Z\"}"}
