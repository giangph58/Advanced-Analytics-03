We\\nintroduce GlobeReady, a clinician-friendly AI platform that enables ocular\\ndisease diagnosis without retraining/fine-tuning or technical expertise.\\nGlobeReady achieves high accuracy across imaging modalities: 93.9-98.5% for an\\n11-category fundus photo dataset and 87.2-92.7% for a 15-category OCT dataset.\\nThrough training-free local feature augmentation, it addresses domain shifts\\nacross centers and populations, reaching an average accuracy of 88.9% across\\nfive centers in China, 86.3% in Vietnam, and 90.2% in the UK. The built-in\\nconfidence-quantifiable diagnostic approach further boosted accuracy to\\n94.9-99.4% (fundus) and 88.2-96.2% (OCT), while identifying out-of-distribution\\ncases at 86.3% (49 CFP categories) and 90.6% (13 OCT categories). Clinicians\\nfrom multiple countries rated GlobeReady highly (average 4.6 out of 5) for its\\nusability and clinical relevance. These results demonstrate GlobeReady's\\nrobust, scalable diagnostic capability and potential to support ophthalmic care\\nwithout technical barriers.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T14:17:22Z\"}"}
