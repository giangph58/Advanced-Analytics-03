We refer to these as quasi-hierarchical\\ndynamic games and define a solution concept called the feedback\\nStackelberg-Nash (FSN) equilibrium. Under a separability assumption on cost\\nfunctions, we formulate FSN solutions recursively using a dynamic\\nprogramming-like approach. We further show that the FSN solution for these\\nconstrained games can be derived from the parametric feedback Stackelberg\\nsolution of an associated unconstrained game with only sequential interactions,\\ngiven parameter choices that satisfy implicit complementarity conditions. For\\nthe linear-quadratic case, we show that the FSN solutions are obtained by\\nreformulating these complementarity conditions as a single large-scale linear\\ncomplementarity problem. Finally, we illustrate our results with a dynamic\\nduopoly game with production constraints.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T11:05:03Z\"}"}
