In this study, we explore\\nthe possibility that the narrow structure is caused by a decay cascade via an\\nintermediate nucleon resonance decaying to $\\\\eta p$ final states. The\\ncandidates for the intermediate nucleon resonances are $N(1700)3/2^{-}$ and\\n$N(1710)1/2^{+}$, with masses near the observed structure. We consider the\\n$t$-channel $\\\\rho$- and $\\\\omega$-exchange diagrams, the $u$-channel\\nnucleon-pole exchange diagram, the contact term, and the $s$-channel pole\\ndiagrams of nucleon, $\\\\Delta$, and nucleon resonances when constructing the\\nreaction amplitudes to reproduce the stripped individual contribution of the\\nnarrow structure. Our analysis indicates that the signature strength of the\\ndecay cascade $\\\\gamma p \\\\to \\\\pi^{0}N(1700)3/2^{-} \\\\to \\\\pi^{0}\\\\eta p$ is too\\nweak to reach the experimental curve of the narrow structure due to the small\\ndecay branching ratio of $N(1700)3/2^{-}$ to $\\\\eta p$. Although the decay\\ncascade $\\\\gamma p \\\\to \\\\pi^{0}N(1710)1/2^{+} \\\\to \\\\pi^{0}\\\\eta p$ can\\nqualitatively reproduce the experimental curve of the invariant mass\\ndistributions, its cross-section width is much larger than that of the\\ncorresponding experimental curve. Therefore, we conclude that the decay cascade\\nvia an intermediate nucleon resonance could not be the reason leading to the\\nnarrow structure in the $\\\\eta p$ invariant mass distributions of the $\\\\gamma p\\n\\\\to \\\\pi^0 \\\\eta p$ reaction.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T06:07:07Z\"}"}
