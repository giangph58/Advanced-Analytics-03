{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05183v1\", \"title\": \"Utility-aware Social Network Anonymization using Genetic Algorithms\", \"summary\": \"Social networks may contain privacy-sensitive information about individuals.\\nThe objective of the network anonymization problem is to alter a given social\\nnetwork dataset such that the number of anonymous nodes in the social graph is\\nmaximized. Here, a node is anonymous if it does not have a unique surrounding\\nnetwork structure. At the same time, the aim is to ensure data utility, i.e.,\\npreserve topological network properties and retain good performance on\\ndownstream network analysis tasks. We propose two versions of a genetic\\nalgorithm tailored to this problem: one generic GA and a uniqueness-aware GA\\n(UGA). The latter aims to target edges more effectively during mutation by\\navoiding edges connected to already anonymous nodes. After hyperparameter\\ntuning, we compare the two GAs against two existing baseline algorithms on\\nseveral real-world network datasets. Results show that the proposed genetic\\nalgorithms manage to anonymize on average 14 times more nodes than the best\\nbaseline algorithm. Additionally, data utility experiments demonstrate how the\\nUGA requires fewer edge deletions, and how our GAs and the baselines retain\\nperformance on downstream tasks equally well. Overall, our results suggest that\\ngenetic algorithms are a promising approach for finding solutions to the\\nnetwork anonymization problem.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SI\", \"categories\": \"cs.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T15:29:28Z\"}"}
