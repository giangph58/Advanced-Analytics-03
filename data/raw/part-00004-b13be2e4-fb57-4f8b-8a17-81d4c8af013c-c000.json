We investigate the properties of dual dimonoids. In the class of\\nnon-commutative dimonoids, we construct a number of abelian, non-abelian, and\\nrectangular dimonoids. The internal structure of these objects is analyzed, in\\nparticular, their automorphism groups and halos are computed.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GR\", \"categories\": \"math.GR,math.RA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T09:21:44Z\"}"}
