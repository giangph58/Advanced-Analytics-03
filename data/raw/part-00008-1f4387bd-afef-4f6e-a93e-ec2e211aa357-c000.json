Especially, we propose a method named\\n$\\\\bar{R}$-operation to subtract out ultraviolet divergences that at the same\\ntime preserves infrared and collinear safety of the original FI. By expressing\\nthese locally finite FIs in terms of master integrals and imposing constraints\\non their $\\\\epsilon$-expanded forms, we reduce the $\\\\epsilon$-expanded master\\nintegrals to a minimal basis. We provide an automated package to identify such\\nconstraints, offering a tool useful for high-order perturbative computations.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T14:34:34Z\"}"}
