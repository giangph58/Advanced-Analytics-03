In this work, we present\\nan optimized methodology for stopping power measurements using the\\nbackscattering technique, with a focus on minimizing both random and systematic\\nuncertainties. By systematically analyzing the sources of uncertainty and\\nrefining the experimental geometry, we establish a robust framework for\\nhigh-precision measurements. Our approach was applied to the stopping power of\\nhelium ions in gold thin films, demonstrating excellent agreement with\\nreference models such as SRIM and ICRU-49. The results reveal that carefully\\nchosen measurement angles can effectively balance statistical precision and\\nsystematic accuracy, achieving total uncertainties below 3% across a wide\\nenergy range. This study provides a refined strategy for stopping power\\ndetermination, offering valuable improvements for ion beam analysis and\\nbenchmarking theoretical models.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det,cond-mat.other,nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T13:58:01Z\"}"}
