As a consequence, we obtain that the Leavitt path\\nalgebras of graphs of Gelfand-Kirillov dimension three are graded Morita\\nequivalent if and only if their graph $C^*$-algebras are equivariant Morita\\nequivalent, and two graphs $E$ and $F$ of Gelfand-Kirillov dimension three are\\nshift equivalent if and only if the singularity categories\\n$\\\\text{D}_{\\\\text{sg}}(KE/J_E^2)$ and $\\\\text{D}_{\\\\text{sg}}(KF/J_F^2)$ are\\ntriangulated equivalent.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RA\", \"categories\": \"math.RA,math.DS,math.OA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:14:00Z\"}"}
