{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06952v1\", \"title\": \"Holographic hybrid stars with slow phase transitions\", \"summary\": \"The $D_3$-$D_7$ holographic model is used to describe the core of the hybrid\\nstar, composed by quark matter, while its crust is modeled from a hadronic\\nrelativistic mean field (RMF) model capable of reproducing low-energy nuclear\\nphysics data as well as some astrophysical observations. The $D_3$-$D_7$ brane\\nconfiguration and the RMF model lead to an equation of state that is used to\\nsolve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations. For different model parameters,\\nthe mass-radius diagram is presented. The conditions for the dynamic stability\\nof stellar configurations are discussed, considering the radial oscillation\\ncriterion for hybrid stars with slow phase transitions. Strikingly, it is shown\\nthat the models generate stable star configurations with a core of quarks. We\\ncompare our results with NICER observational data for the pulsars PSR\\nJ0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620 and show that the compact stars generated from\\nthis method fall within the corresponding observational regions.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:58:58Z\"}"}
