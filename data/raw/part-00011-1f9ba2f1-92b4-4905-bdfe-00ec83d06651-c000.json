Gravitational dynamical friction due to\\nhalo particles causes GC orbits to contract over time, providing a beyond-mean\\nfield test of the cold dark matter paradigm. We explore the information content\\nof such systems, using N-body and semianalytic simulations and scanning over a\\nrange of initial conditions. We consider data from the ultradiffuse galaxies\\nNGC5846-UDG1 and UDG-DF44, and from the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy. The GC\\nsystems of UDG1 and Fornax indicate the presence of dark matter halos,\\nindependent of (but consistent with) stellar kinematics data. UDG-DF44 is too\\ndiffuse for dynamical friction to give strong constraints. Our analysis can be\\nextended to many additional galaxies.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T10:53:02Z\"}"}
