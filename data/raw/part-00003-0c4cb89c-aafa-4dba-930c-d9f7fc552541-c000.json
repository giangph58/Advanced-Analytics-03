{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04930v1\", \"title\": \"Accurate and Fast Channel Estimation for Fluid Antenna Systems with\\n  Diffusion Models\", \"summary\": \"Fluid antenna systems (FAS) offer enhanced spatial diversity for\\nnext-generation wireless systems. However, acquiring accurate channel state\\ninformation (CSI) remains challenging due to the large number of reconfigurable\\nports and the limited availability of radio-frequency (RF) chains --\\nparticularly in high-dimensional FAS scenarios. To address this challenge, we\\npropose an efficient posterior sampling-based channel estimator that leverages\\na diffusion model (DM) with a simplified U-Net architecture to capture the\\nspatial correlation structure of two-dimensional FAS channels. The DM is\\ninitially trained offline in an unsupervised way and then applied online as a\\nlearned implicit prior to reconstruct CSI from partial observations via\\nposterior sampling through a denoising diffusion restoration model (DDRM). To\\naccelerate the online inference, we introduce a skipped sampling strategy that\\nupdates only a subset of latent variables during the sampling process, thereby\\nreducing the computational cost with minimal accuracy degradation. Simulation\\nresults demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significantly higher\\nestimation accuracy and over 20x speedup compared to state-of-the-art\\ncompressed sensing-based methods, highlighting its potential for practical\\ndeployment in high-dimensional FAS.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,eess.SP,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T04:09:31Z\"}"}
