{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05267v1\", \"title\": \"A Telecentric Offset Reflective Imaging System (TORIS) for Terahertz\\n  Imaging and Spectroscopy\", \"summary\": \"Terahertz (THz) imaging has emerged as a promising technology in medical\\ndiagnostics due to its non-ionizing radiation and high sensitivity to water\\ncontent. However, conventional THz imaging systems face limitations such as\\nslow mechanical scanning, restricted field of view, and poor telecentricity. To\\novercome these challenges, we introduce the Telecentric Offset Reflective\\nImaging System (TORIS), a novel dual-mirror scanning design optimized for\\nhigh-speed, distortion-free imaging. The system employs a telecentric f-theta\\nlens and is validated using ray tracing and physical optics simulations. It\\nachieves uniform resolution across a 50 mm x 50 mm field of view without the\\nneed for mechanical translation stages. Broadband spectral imaging of a USAF\\nresolution test target across WR-2.2 (325-500 GHz) and WR-1.5 (500-700 GHz)\\nfrequency bands demonstrates consistent beam focus and minimal distortion, with\\na maximum deviation of 2.7 degrees from normal incidence and a beam waist of\\n2.1 lambda at the field edge in the WR-1.5 band. The system's sensitivity to\\nhydration dynamics is further validated through imaging of wet tissue paper,\\ncapturing temporal changes in water content. In vivo imaging of human skin\\nafter capsaicin patch application reveals localized hydration variations due to\\nbiochemical response and adhesive removal. These findings confirm the system's\\npotential for real-time hydration sensing and dermatological evaluation. TORIS\\nsets a new benchmark in THz imaging, with applications in clinical diagnostics,\\nwound assessment, and material characterization.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T17:05:35Z\"}"}
