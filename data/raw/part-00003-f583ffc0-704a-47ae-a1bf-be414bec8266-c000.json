{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11203v1\", \"title\": \"Braiding vineyards\", \"summary\": \"Vineyards are a common way to study persistence diagrams of a data set which\\nis changing, as strong stability means that it is possible to pair points in\\n``nearby'' persistence diagrams, yielding a family of point sets which connect\\ninto curves when stacked. Recent work has also studied monodromy in the\\npersistent homology transform, demonstrating some interesting connections\\nbetween an input shape and monodromy in the persistent homology transform for\\n0-dimensional homology embedded in $\\\\mathbb{R}^2$. In this work, we\\nre-characterize monodromy in terms of periodicity of the associated vineyard of\\npersistence diagrams.\\n  We construct a family of objects in any dimension which have non-trivial\\nmonodromy for $l$-persistence of any periodicity and for any $l$. More\\ngenerally we prove that any knot or link can appear as a vineyard for a shape\\nin $\\\\mathbb{R}^d$, with $d\\\\geq 3$. This shows an intriguing and, to the best of\\nour knowledge, previously unknown connection between knots and persistence\\nvineyards. In particular this shows that vineyards are topologically as rich as\\none could possibly hope.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CG\", \"categories\": \"cs.CG,math.AT,math.GT,I.3.5\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:02:59Z\"}"}
