{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00252v1\", \"title\": \"Emergent Synaptic Plasticity from Tunable Dynamics of Probabilistic Bits\", \"summary\": \"Probabilistic (p-) computing, which leverages the stochasticity of its\\nbuilding blocks (p-bits) to solve a variety of computationally hard problems,\\nhas recently emerged as a promising physics-inspired hardware accelerator\\nplatform. A functionality of importance for p-computers is the ability to\\nprogram-and reprogram-the interaction strength between arbitrary p-bits\\non-chip. In natural systems subject to random fluctuations, it is known that\\nspatiotemporal noise can interact with the system's nonlinearities to render\\nuseful functionalities. Leveraging that principle, here we introduce a novel\\nscheme for tunable coupling that inserts a ''hidden'' p-bit between each pair\\nof computational p-bits. By modulating the fluctuation rate of the hidden p-bit\\nrelative to the synapse speed, we demonstrate both numerically and analytically\\nthat the effective interaction between the computational p-bits can be\\ncontinuously tuned. Moreover, this tunability is directional, where the\\neffective coupling from one computational p-bit to another can be made\\ndifferent from the reverse. This synaptic-plasticity mechanism could open new\\navenues for designing (re-)configurable p-computers and may inspire novel\\nalgorithms that leverage dynamic, hardware-level tuning of stochastic\\ninteractions.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn,physics.app-ph,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T02:35:52Z\"}"}
