{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19567v1\", \"title\": \"GenPTW: In-Generation Image Watermarking for Provenance Tracing and\\n  Tamper Localization\", \"summary\": \"The rapid development of generative image models has brought tremendous\\nopportunities to AI-generated content (AIGC) creation, while also introducing\\ncritical challenges in ensuring content authenticity and copyright ownership.\\nExisting image watermarking methods, though partially effective, often rely on\\npost-processing or reference images, and struggle to balance fidelity,\\nrobustness, and tamper localization. To address these limitations, we propose\\nGenPTW, an In-Generation image watermarking framework for latent diffusion\\nmodels (LDMs), which integrates Provenance Tracing and Tamper Localization into\\na unified Watermark-based design. It embeds structured watermark signals during\\nthe image generation phase, enabling unified provenance tracing and tamper\\nlocalization. For extraction, we construct a frequency-coordinated decoder to\\nimprove robustness and localization precision in complex editing scenarios.\\nAdditionally, a distortion layer that simulates AIGC editing is introduced to\\nenhance robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GenPTW outperforms\\nexisting methods in image fidelity, watermark extraction accuracy, and tamper\\nlocalization performance, offering an efficient and practical solution for\\ntrustworthy AIGC image generation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T08:21:39Z\"}"}
