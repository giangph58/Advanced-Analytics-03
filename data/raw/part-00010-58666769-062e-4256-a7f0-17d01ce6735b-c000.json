{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20506v1\", \"title\": \"SPARK Hand: Scooping-Pinching Adaptive Robotic Hand with Kempe Mechanism\\n  for Vertical Passive Grasp in Environmental Constraints\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents the SPARK finger, an innovative passive adaptive robotic\\nfinger capable of executing both parallel pinching and scooping grasps. The\\nSPARK finger incorporates a multi-link mechanism with Kempe linkages to achieve\\na vertical linear fingertip trajectory. Furthermore, a parallelogram linkage\\nensures the fingertip maintains a fixed orientation relative to the base,\\nfacilitating precise and stable manipulation. By integrating these mechanisms\\nwith elastic elements, the design enables effective interaction with surfaces,\\nsuch as tabletops, to handle challenging objects. The finger employs a passive\\nswitching mechanism that facilitates seamless transitions between pinching and\\nscooping modes, adapting automatically to various object shapes and\\nenvironmental constraints without additional actuators. To demonstrate its\\nversatility, the SPARK Hand, equipped with two SPARK fingers, has been\\ndeveloped. This system exhibits enhanced grasping performance and stability for\\nobjects of diverse sizes and shapes, particularly thin and flat objects that\\nare traditionally challenging for conventional grippers. Experimental results\\nvalidate the effectiveness of the SPARK design, highlighting its potential for\\nrobotic manipulation in constrained and dynamic environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T07:47:06Z\"}"}
