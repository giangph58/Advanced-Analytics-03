The\\nchallenge of this task lies in measuring the influences of different news\\nevents towards the fluctuations of time series. This requires agents to possess\\nstronger abilities of innovative thinking and the identifying misleading logic.\\nHowever, the existing multi-agent discussion framework has limited enhancement\\non time series prediction in terms of optimizing these two capabilities.\\nInspired by the role of competition in fostering innovation, this study embeds\\na competition mechanism within the multi-agent discussion to enhance agents'\\ncapability of generating innovative thoughts. Furthermore, to bolster the\\nmodel's proficiency in identifying misleading information, we incorporate a\\nfine-tuned small-scale LLM model within the reflective stage, offering\\nauxiliary decision-making support. Experimental results confirm that the\\ncompetition can boost agents' capacity for innovative thinking, which can\\nsignificantly improve the performances of time series prediction. Similar to\\nthe findings of social science, the intensity of competition within this\\nframework can influence the performances of agents, providing a new perspective\\nfor studying LLMs-based multi-agent systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T13:25:50Z\"}"}
