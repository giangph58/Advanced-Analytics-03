When particles are killed below\\nthe origin, we show that the limit of this martingale admits an exponential\\ntail, contrary to the case without killing, where the tail is polynomial. In\\nthe critical case, where the characteristic equation has a single root, the\\nsame holds for the (truncated) derivative martingale, as we show. This study is\\nmotivated by recent work on first passage percolation on Erd\\\\H{o}s-R\\\\'enyi\\ngraphs.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:32:43Z\"}"}
