{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15855v1\", \"title\": \"Generating heterogeneous data on gene trees\", \"summary\": \"We introduce GenPhylo, a Python module that simulates nucleotide sequence\\ndata along a phylogeny avoiding the restriction of continuous-time Markov\\nprocesses. GenPhylo uses directly a general Markov model and therefore\\nnaturally incorporates heterogeneity across lineages. We solve the challenge of\\ngenerating transition matrices with a pre-given expected number of\\nsubstitutions (the branch length information) by providing an algorithm that\\ncan be incorporated in other simulation software.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.PE\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.PE,92-10\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T12:52:10Z\"}"}
