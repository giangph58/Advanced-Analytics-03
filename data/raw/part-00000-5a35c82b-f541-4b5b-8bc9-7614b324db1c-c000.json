{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04447v1\", \"title\": \"Warming up the Fibres\", \"summary\": \"Fibre inflationary models are constructed in type-IIB string flux\\ncompactification. These models have been shown to be in agreement with the\\ncosmological observations under appropriate choices of parameters, which\\noriginate from their string theory construction. In the present work, we embed\\nsuch models, originally studied in the cold inflation picture, in the context\\nof warm inflation. We study the viability of different fibre inflation\\npotentials in both strong and weak dissipative regime of warm inflation. In\\nfibre inflation, the inflaton is a four-dimensional complex manifold -- a fibre\\nof a $K3$ fibred Calabi-Yau. The potential in this case is generated by an\\ninterplay of various perturbative and non-perturbative corrections. The former\\ntype of corrections consists of leading-order $\\\\alpha'^3-$ term, higher\\nderivative $F^4-$ correction, and various string loop corrections of KK,\\nlog-loop and winding type. Depending on the balance between several\\ncorrections, we present four different fibre inflationary potentials and show\\nthat the warm inflationary pictures for all of them can successfully fall in\\nthe viable window from both Planck and recent Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT)\\ndata. We show that warm inflation makes it possible to extend the range of\\nparameters of applicability of these models. Our results also indicate that\\nwith the help of a large dissipation ratio, one can achieve a sub-Planckian\\nfield excursion, although, this runs on the possibility of moving away from the\\nperturbative control of low-energy four-dimensional supergravity theory.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:17:31Z\"}"}
