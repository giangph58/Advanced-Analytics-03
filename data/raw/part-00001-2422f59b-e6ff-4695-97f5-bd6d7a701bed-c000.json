Based\\non a nonlinear coordinate transformation proposed in \\\\cite{LXY2019}, we first\\nprove the local-in-time well-posedness for the compressible magneto-micropolar\\nboundary layer system in Sobolev spaces, provided that initial tangential\\nmagnetic field is non-degenerate.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T10:10:40Z\"}"}
