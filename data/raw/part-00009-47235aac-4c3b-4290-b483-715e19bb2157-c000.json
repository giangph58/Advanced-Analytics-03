In the\\ncase that $G_\\\\mathcal{S}(2)$ is algebraic over $\\\\mathbb{Q}$ of degree $d\\\\ge 2$,\\nwe prove that the $N$th $2$-adic complexity of $\\\\mathcal{S}$ is at least\\n$\\\\frac{N}{d}+O(1)$, where the implied constant depends only on the minimal\\npolynomial of $G_\\\\mathcal{S}(2)$. This result is an analog of the bound of\\nM\\\\'erai and the second author on the linear complexity of automatic sequences,\\nthat is, sequences with algebraic $G_\\\\mathcal{S}(X)$ over the rational function\\nfield $\\\\mathbb{F}_2(X)$. We further discuss the most important case $d=2$ in\\nboth settings and explain that the intersection of the set of $2$-adic\\nalgebraic sequences and the set of automatic sequences is the set of\\n(eventually) periodic sequences. Finally, we provide some experimental results\\nsupporting the conjecture that $2$-adic algebraic sequences can have also a\\ndesirable $N$th linear complexity and automatic sequences a desirable $N$th\\n$2$-adic complexity, respectively.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT,cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T06:52:47Z\"}"}
