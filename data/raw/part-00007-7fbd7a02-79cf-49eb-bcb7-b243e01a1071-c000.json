New physics can affect both Higgs boson production and decay, leading to\\ndeviations from the distributions that are expected in the standard model. In\\nthis paper, combined measurements of differential spectra in a fiducial region\\nmatching the experimental selections are performed, based on analyses of four\\nHiggs boson decay channels ($\\\\gamma\\\\gamma$, ZZ$^{(*)}$, WW$^{(*)}$, and\\n$\\\\tau\\\\tau$) using proton-proton collision data recorded with the CMS detector\\nat $\\\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138\\nfb$^{-1}$. The differential measurements are extrapolated to the full phase\\nspace and combined to provide the differential spectra. A measurement of the\\ntotal Higgs boson production cross section is also performed using the\\n$\\\\gamma\\\\gamma$ and ZZ decay channels, with a result of 53.4$^{+2.9}_{-2.9}$\\n(stat)$^{+1.9}_{-1.8}$ (syst) pb, consistent with the standard model prediction\\nof 55.6 $\\\\pm$ 2.5 pb. The fiducial measurements are used to compute limits on\\nHiggs boson couplings using the $\\\\kappa$-framework and the SM effective field\\ntheory.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T16:48:08Z\"}"}
