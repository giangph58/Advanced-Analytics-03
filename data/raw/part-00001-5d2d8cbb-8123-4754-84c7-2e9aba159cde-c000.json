Our\\nmain objective is to establish approximate controllability by using the\\ncontrollability of the inviscid Burgers system, linearized around a suitably\\nconstructed trajectory. In contrast to earlier approaches based on Lie\\nalgebraic techniques, our method offers a more concise proof and sheds new\\nlight on the structure of the control. Although the approach necessitates a\\nhigher-dimensional control space, both the structure and dimension of the\\ncontrol remain uniform with respect to the order of the dispersive equation and\\nthe control time.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:10:48Z\"}"}
