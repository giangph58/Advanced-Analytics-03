{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01717v1\", \"title\": \"Construction of MDS Euclidean Self-Dual Codes via Multiple Subsets\", \"summary\": \"MDS self-dual codes have good algebraic structure, and their parameters are\\ncompletely determined by the code length. In recent years, the construction of\\nMDS Euclidean self-dual codes with new lengths has become an important issue in\\ncoding theory. In this paper, we are committed to constructing new MDS\\nEuclidean self-dual codes via generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes and their\\nextended (EGRS) codes. The main effort of our constructions is to find suitable\\nsubsets of finite fields as the evaluation sets, ensuring that the\\ncorresponding (extended) GRS codes are Euclidean self-dual. Firstly, we present\\na method for selecting evaluation sets from multiple intersecting subsets and\\nprovide a theorem to guarantee that the chosen evaluation sets meet the desired\\ncriteria. Secondly, based on this theorem, we construct six new classes of MDS\\nEuclidean self-dual codes using the norm function, as well as the union of\\nthree multiplicity subgroups and their cosets respectively. Finally, in our\\nconstructions, the proportion of possible MDS Euclidean self-dual codes exceeds\\n85\\\\%, which is much higher than previously reported results.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T13:26:04Z\"}"}
