More precisely, we\\nessentially assume that the drift coefficient is piecewise Lipschitz continuous\\nwith an exceptional set $\\\\Theta\\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^d$ that is an orientable\\n$C^4$-hypersurface of positive reach, the diffusion coefficient is assumed to\\nbe Lipschitz continuous and, in a neighborhood of $\\\\Theta$, both coefficients\\nare bounded and the diffusion coefficient has a non-degenerate portion\\northogonal to $\\\\Theta$.\\n  In recent years, a number of results have been proven in the literature for\\nstrong approximation of such SDEs and, in particular, the performance of the\\nEuler-Maruyama scheme was studied. For $d=1$ and finite $\\\\Theta$ it was shown\\nthat the Euler-Maruyama scheme achieves an $L_p$-error rate of at least $1/2$\\nfor all $p\\\\geq 1$ as in the classical case of Lipschitz continuous\\ncoefficients. For $d>1$, it was only known so far, that the Euler-Maruyama\\nscheme achieves an $L_2$-error rate of at least $1/4-$ if, additionally, the\\ncoefficients $\\\\mu$ and $\\\\sigma$ are globally bounded.\\n  In this article, we prove that in the above setting the Euler-Maruyama scheme\\nin fact achieves an $L_{p}$-error rate of at least $1/2-$ for all\\n$d\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}$ and all $p\\\\geq 1$. The proof of this result is based on the\\nwell-known approach of transforming such an SDE into an SDE with globally\\nLipschitz continuous coefficients, a new It\\\\^{o} formula for a class of\\nfunctions which are not globally $C^2$ and a detailed analysis of the expected\\ntotal time that the actual position of the time-continuous Euler-Maruyama\\nscheme and its position at the preceding time point on the underlying grid are\\non 'different sides' of the hypersurface $\\\\Theta$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:37:06Z\"}"}
