We obtain Baernstein\\ntype extremal results for the analytic and co-analytic parts of harmonic\\nfunctions in the major geometric subclasses (e.g. convex, starlike,\\nclose-to-convex, convex in one direction) of $\\\\mathcal{S}_H^0(K)$. We then use\\nthese results to obtain integral mean estimates for the respective classes.\\nFurthermore, we find the range of $p>0$ such that these geometric classes of\\nquasiconformal mappings are contained in the harmonic Hardy space $h^p$,\\nthereby refining some earlier results of Nowak. Our findings extend the recent\\ndevelopments on harmonic quasiconformal mappings by Li and Ponnusamy.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CV\", \"categories\": \"math.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T08:01:31Z\"}"}
