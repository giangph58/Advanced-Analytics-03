Firstly, we investigated the\\ninfluence of EMS parameters on the black hole shadow using the null geodesic\\nmethod and constrained these parameters based on EHT observations of M87* and\\nSgr A*. Furthermore, we analyzed the direct emission, lensing ring, and photon\\nring structures in EMS black hole. Comparing our results with the Schwarzschild\\nand Reissner-Nordstr$\\\\ddot{\\\\mathrm{o}}$m (RN) black holes, we found that the\\nSchwarzschild black hole exhibits the largest shadow radius and the highest\\nobserved intensity. Increasing the EMS model parameters leads to a reduction in\\nintensity. Ultimately, our findings suggest that imaging black hole accretion\\ndisks does not clearly distinguish among these three types of black holes.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T15:35:47Z\"}"}
