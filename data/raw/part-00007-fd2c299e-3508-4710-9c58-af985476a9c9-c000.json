{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15993v1\", \"title\": \"Benchmarking machine learning models for predicting aerofoil performance\", \"summary\": \"This paper investigates the capability of Neural Networks (NNs) as\\nalternatives to the traditional methods to analyse the performance of aerofoils\\nused in the wind and tidal energy industry. The current methods used to assess\\nthe characteristic lift and drag coefficients include Computational Fluid\\nDynamics (CFD), thin aerofoil and panel methods, all face trade-offs between\\ncomputational speed and the accuracy of the results and as such NNs have been\\ninvestigated as an alternative with the aim that it would perform both quickly\\nand accurately. As such, this paper provides a benchmark for the windAI_bench\\ndataset published by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in the\\nUSA. In order to validate the methodology of the benchmarking, the AirfRANS\\n{\\\\tt arXiv:2212.07564v3} dataset is used as both a starting point and a point\\nof comparison. This study evaluates four neural networks (MLP, PointNet,\\nGraphSAGE, GUNet) trained on a range aerofoils at 25 angles of attack\\n(4$^\\\\circ$ to 20$^\\\\circ$). to predict fluid flow and calculate lift\\ncoefficients ($C_L$) via the panel method. GraphSAGE and GUNet performed well\\nduring the testing phase, but underperformed during validation. Accordingly,\\nthis paper has identified PointNet and MLP as the two strongest models tested,\\nhowever whilst the results from MLP are more commonly correct for predicting\\nthe behaviour of the fluid, the results from PointNet provide the more accurate\\nresults for calculating $C_L$.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T15:54:49Z\"}"}
