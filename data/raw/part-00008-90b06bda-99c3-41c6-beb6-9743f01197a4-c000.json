{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06957v1\", \"title\": \"A Comparison of Deep Learning Methods for Cell Detection in Digital\\n  Cytology\", \"summary\": \"Accurate and efficient cell detection is crucial in many biomedical image\\nanalysis tasks. We evaluate the performance of several Deep Learning (DL)\\nmethods for cell detection in Papanicolaou-stained cytological Whole Slide\\nImages (WSIs), focusing on accuracy of predictions and computational\\nefficiency. We examine recentoff-the-shelf algorithms as well as\\ncustom-designed detectors, applying them to two datasets: the CNSeg Dataset and\\nthe Oral Cancer (OC) Dataset. Our comparison includes well-established\\nsegmentation methods such as StarDist, Cellpose, and the Segment Anything Model\\n2 (SAM2), alongside centroid-based Fully Convolutional Regression Network\\n(FCRN) approaches. We introduce a suitable evaluation metric to assess the\\naccuracy of predictions based on the distance from ground truth positions. We\\nalso explore the impact of dataset size and data augmentation techniques on\\nmodel performance. Results show that centroid-based methods, particularly the\\nImproved Fully Convolutional Regression Network (IFCRN) method, outperform\\nsegmentation-based methods in terms of both detection accuracy and\\ncomputational efficiency. This study highlights the potential of centroid-based\\ndetectors as a preferred option for cell detection in resource-limited\\nenvironments, offering faster processing times and lower GPU memory usage\\nwithout compromising accuracy.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T15:08:12Z\"}"}
