{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19584v1\", \"title\": \"ShowMak3r: Compositional TV Show Reconstruction\", \"summary\": \"Reconstructing dynamic radiance fields from video clips is challenging,\\nespecially when entertainment videos like TV shows are given. Many challenges\\nmake the reconstruction difficult due to (1) actors occluding with each other\\nand having diverse facial expressions, (2) cluttered stages, and (3) small\\nbaseline views or sudden shot changes. To address these issues, we present\\nShowMak3r, a comprehensive reconstruction pipeline that allows the editing of\\nscenes like how video clips are made in a production control room. In\\nShowMak3r, a 3DLocator module locates recovered actors on the stage using depth\\nprior and estimates unseen human poses via interpolation. The proposed\\nShotMatcher module then tracks the actors under shot changes. Furthermore,\\nShowMak3r introduces a face-fitting network that dynamically recovers the\\nactors' expressions. Experiments on Sitcoms3D dataset show that our pipeline\\ncan reassemble TV show scenes with new cameras at different timestamps. We also\\ndemonstrate that ShowMak3r enables interesting applications such as synthetic\\nshot-making, actor relocation, insertion, deletion, and pose manipulation.\\nProject page : https://nstar1125.github.io/showmak3r\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T08:44:42Z\"}"}
