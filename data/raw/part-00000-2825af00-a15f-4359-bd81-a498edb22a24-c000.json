However, several leakage-abuse attacks have highlighted some security\\nvulnerabilities. Recent attacks assumed an attacker's knowledge containing data\\n``similar'' to the indexed data. However, this vague assumption is barely\\ndiscussed in literature: how likely is it for an attacker to obtain a \\\"similar\\nenough\\\" data?\\n  Our paper provides novel statistical tools usable on any attack in this\\nsetting to analyze its sensitivity to data similarity. First, we introduce a\\nmathematical model based on statistical estimators to analytically understand\\nthe attackers' knowledge and the notion of similarity. Second, we conceive\\nstatistical tools to model the influence of the similarity on the attack\\naccuracy. We apply our tools on three existing attacks to answer questions such\\nas: is similarity the only factor influencing accuracy of a given attack?\\nThird, we show that the enforcement of a maximum index size can make the\\n``similar-data'' assumption harder to satisfy. In particular, we propose a\\nstatistical method to estimate an appropriate maximum size for a given attack\\nand dataset. For the best known attack on the Enron dataset, a maximum index\\nsize of 200 guarantees (with high probability) the attack accuracy to be below\\n5%.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T05:04:25Z\"}"}
