{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17238v1\", \"title\": \"Crisp: Cognitive Restructuring of Negative Thoughts through Multi-turn\\n  Supportive Dialogues\", \"summary\": \"Cognitive Restructuring (CR) is a psychotherapeutic process aimed at\\nidentifying and restructuring an individual's negative thoughts, arising from\\nmental health challenges, into more helpful and positive ones via multi-turn\\ndialogues. Clinician shortage and stigma urge the development of human-LLM\\ninteractive psychotherapy for CR. Yet, existing efforts implement CR via simple\\ntext rewriting, fixed-pattern dialogues, or a one-shot CR workflow, failing to\\nalign with the psychotherapeutic process for effective CR. To address this gap,\\nwe propose CRDial, a novel framework for CR, which creates multi-turn dialogues\\nwith specifically designed identification and restructuring stages of negative\\nthoughts, integrates sentence-level supportive conversation strategies, and\\nadopts a multi-channel loop mechanism to enable iterative CR. With CRDial, we\\ndistill Crisp, a large-scale and high-quality bilingual dialogue dataset, from\\nLLM. We then train Crispers, Crisp-based conversational LLMs for CR, at 7B and\\n14B scales. Extensive human studies show the superiority of Crispers in\\npointwise, pairwise, and intervention evaluations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T04:22:00Z\"}"}
