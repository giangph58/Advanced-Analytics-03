By employing Doi- Peliti formalism we recast the master equation in\\nthe form of a Schr\\\\\\\"odinger-like equation. Therein appearing pseudo-Hamiltonian\\nis conveniently expressed in a suitable Fock space, constructed using\\nbosonic-like creation and annihilation operators. The kernel of the associated\\ntime evolution operator is rewritten using a functional integral, for which we\\npropose an approximate method that allows its analytical treatment. The method\\nis based on the expansion in eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian generating given\\nfunctional integral. In this manner, we obtain approximate values for the\\nprobabilities of the system being in the first and second states for the case\\nof the pure birth process.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T11:08:31Z\"}"}
