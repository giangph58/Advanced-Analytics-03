{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16676v1\", \"title\": \"Volumes of divisors in a family and variation of singularities of linear\\n  systems\", \"summary\": \"We study the behavior of volumes of divisors in a family. We show that the\\nvolume of a divisor on the generic fiber equals the infimum of its volumes on\\nfibers over any dense subset of the base. As an application, we show that the\\nvolume function is upper semicontinuous in flat families with reduced and\\nirreducible fibers.\\n  We also prove that for a $\\\\mathbb{Q}$-Cartier divisor $B$ on a family of\\nvarieties $X\\\\rightarrow T$, if $(X_t,|B_t|_{\\\\mathbb{Q}})$ is $\\\\epsilon$-lc and\\nthe volume of $B_t$ is a constant for densely many closed points $t\\\\in T$, then\\nthe generic fiber $(X_\\\\eta,|B_\\\\eta|_{\\\\mathbb{Q}})$ is also $\\\\epsilon$-lc.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T12:46:23Z\"}"}
