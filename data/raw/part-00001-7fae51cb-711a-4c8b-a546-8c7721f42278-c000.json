{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15662v1\", \"title\": \"On GKM fiber bundles and realizability with full flag fibers\", \"summary\": \"We investigate under which conditions an equivariant fiber bundle whose base,\\ntotal space and fiber are GKM manifolds induces a fibration or fiber bundle of\\nthe corresponding GKM graphs. In particular, we give several counterexamples.\\nConcerning the converse direction, i.e., the realization problem for fiber\\nbundles of GKM graphs, we restrict to the setting of fiberwise signed GKM fiber\\nbundles over $n$-gons whose fiber is the GKM graph of a full flag manifold.\\nWhile it was known that any such bundle is realizable for a\\n$\\\\mathbb{CP}^1$-fiber, we observe that new phenomena occur in higher dimensions\\nwhere realizability depends on the twist automorphism of the GKM fiber bundle.\\nWe classify possible twist isomorphsims and show that realizability can be\\ndecided in terms of our classification.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AT\", \"categories\": \"math.AT,math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T07:37:33Z\"}"}
