However, their application to crystal structure\\nprediction (CSP) is still ineffective due to symmetry agnostic encoding of\\natomic coordinates. We introduce CRYSIM, an algorithm that encodes the space\\ngroup, the Wyckoff positions combination, and coordinates of independent atomic\\nsites as separate variables. This encoding reduces the search space\\nsubstantially by exploiting the symmetry in space groups. When CRYSIM is\\ninterfaced to Fixstars Amplify, a GPU-based Ising machine, its prediction\\nperformance was competitive with CALYPSO and Bayesian optimization for crystals\\ncontaining more than 150 atoms in a unit cell. Although it is not realistic to\\ninterface CRYSIM to current small-scale quantum devices, it has the potential\\nto become the standard CSP algorithm in the coming quantum age.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:33:48Z\"}"}
