While the first is associative, the latter is not. But the major\\ndrawback of the Minkowski combination is that, by increasing the number of\\nsummands, this leads to convexification. The present article is uncovered in\\ntwo folds: The initial segment presents a novel approach to approximate a\\ncontinuous set-valued function with compact images via a fractal approach using\\nthe metric linear combination of sets. The other segment contains the dimension\\nanalysis of the distance set of graph of set-valued function and solving the\\ncelebrated distance set conjecture. In the end, a decomposition of any\\ncontinuous convex compact set-valued function is exhibited that preserves the\\nHausdorff dimension, so this will serve as a method for dealing with\\ncomplicated set-valued functions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:25:29Z\"}"}
