Based on\\nnumerical calculations, and assuming two conjectures, we provide the complete\\npicture for which values of $q$ these ribbon tensor categories are\\n(pseudo-)unitary and for which values of $q$ they are modular. We compare our\\nresults with the extensive rigorous results appearing in the literature,\\nfinding complete agreement. For the cases that do not appear in the literature,\\nwe complete the picture.\", \"main_category\": \"math.QA\", \"categories\": \"math.QA\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:32:29Z\"}"}
