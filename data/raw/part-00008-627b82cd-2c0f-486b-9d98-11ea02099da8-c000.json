{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24319v1\", \"title\": \"Resolving the baryon assymmetry with RATS\", \"summary\": \"Current leading theories of physics such as the Big Bang, the standard model\\nof particle physics, and general relativity suggest that the universe should\\ncontain an equal amount of matter and antimatter. Yet observations have found a\\ndisproportionately large amount of matter, a phenomenon known as the baryon\\nassymmetry problem. Since century-old established theories are traditionally\\nimpossible to refute, the only possible explanation is that the remaining\\nantimatter is hidden in plain sight and remains to be observed. We propose the\\nexistence of anti-stars to solve the baryon assymetry in our new Reasonable\\nAntimatter Theory of Stars (RATS). In this context, the RATS will create a\\nframework to resolve the traditional tension between observers and theorists,\\nand thus contribute to the peaceful and collaborative spirit of astronomy. Our\\nmethod is the firing of neurons in our brains, typically known as a thought\\nexperiment. We still have no idea why or how this works, but it must be good\\nbecause most of science was created this way. Our results are the result of our\\nmethods, which result in some text and the resulting conclusions. In order to\\nencourage the reader to reach the end of this short paper, we do not want to\\nspoil the conclusions here. Instead, the conclusions will conclude the paper.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.pop-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.pop-ph,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:07:37Z\"}"}
