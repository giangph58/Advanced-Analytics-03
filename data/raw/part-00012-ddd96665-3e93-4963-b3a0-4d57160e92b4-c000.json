{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12828v1\", \"title\": \"Predicting Stock Prices using Permutation Decision Trees and Strategic\\n  Trailing\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we explore the application of Permutation Decision Trees (PDT)\\nand strategic trailing for predicting stock market movements and executing\\nprofitable trades in the Indian stock market. We focus on high-frequency data\\nusing 5-minute candlesticks for the top 50 stocks listed in the NIFTY 50 index.\\nWe implement a trading strategy that aims to buy stocks at lower prices and\\nsell them at higher prices, capitalizing on short-term market fluctuations. Due\\nto regulatory constraints in India, short selling is not considered in our\\nstrategy. The model incorporates various technical indicators and employs\\nhyperparameters such as the trailing stop-loss value and support thresholds to\\nmanage risk effectively. Our results indicate that the proposed trading bot has\\nthe potential to outperform the market average and yield returns higher than\\nthe risk-free rate offered by 10-year Indian government bonds. We trained and\\ntested data on a 60 day dataset provided by Yahoo Finance. Specifically, 12\\ndays for testing and 48 days for training. Our bot based on permutation\\ndecision tree achieved a profit of 1.3468 % over a 12-day testing period, where\\nas a bot based on LSTM gave a return of 0.1238 % over a 12-day testing period\\nand a bot based on RNN gave a return of 0.3096 % over a 12-day testing period.\\nAll of the bots outperform the buy-and-hold strategy, which resulted in a loss\\nof 2.2508 %.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T10:42:38Z\"}"}
