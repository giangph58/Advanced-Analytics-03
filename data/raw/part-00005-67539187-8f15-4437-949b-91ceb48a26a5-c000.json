Rule systems allow\\nqueries using such rules to be done automatically. It is well known that rule\\nsystems using different inference methods can have very different efficiency on\\nthe same rules and queries. In fact, different variants of rules and queries\\nexpressing the same relationships can have more drastically different\\nefficiency in the same rule system. Many other differences can also cause\\ndifferences in efficiency. What exactly are the differences? Can we capture\\nthem exactly and predict efficiency precisely? What are the best systems to\\nuse?\\n  This paper analyzes together the efficiency of all three types of well-known\\ninference methods -- query-driven, ground-and-solve, and fact-driven -- with\\noptimizations, and compares with optimal complexities for the first time,\\nespecially for analyzing transitive relations. We also experiment with rule\\nsystems widely considered to have best performances for each type. We analyze\\nall well-known variants of the rules and examine a wide variety of input\\nrelationship graphs. Our results include precisely calculated optimal time\\ncomplexities; exact explanations and comparisons across different inference\\nmethods, rule variants, and graph types; confirmation with detailed\\nmeasurements from performance experiments; and answers to the key questions\\nabove.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DB\", \"categories\": \"cs.DB,cs.PL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T03:55:48Z\"}"}
