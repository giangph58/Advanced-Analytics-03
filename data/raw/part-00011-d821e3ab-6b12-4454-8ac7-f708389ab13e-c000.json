Generic\\nprogrammable support for fine-grained instruction analysis has gained broad\\ninterest in the literature as a fundamental building block for the security of\\nfuture processors. Yet, implementation in real out-of-order (OoO) superscalar\\nprocessors presents tough challenges that cannot be explored in highly abstract\\nsimulators. We detail the challenges of implementing complex programmable\\npathways without critical paths or contention. We then introduce FireGuard, the\\nfirst implementation of fine-grained instruction analysis on a real OoO\\nsuperscalar processor. We establish an end-to-end system, including\\nmicroarchitecture, SoC, ISA and programming model. Experiments show that our\\nsolution simultaneously ensures both security and performance of the system,\\nwith parallel scalability. We examine the feasibility of building FireGuard\\ninto modern SoCs: Apple's M1-Pro, Huawei's Kirin-960, and Intel's i7-12700F,\\nwhere less than 1% silicon area is introduced.
