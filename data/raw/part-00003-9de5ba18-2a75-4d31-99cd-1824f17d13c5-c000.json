In this work, we\\nstudy the behavior of nematic disclinations in thin parallel-plate geometries\\nwith strong patterned planar anchoring. Building on prior models, we solve both\\nthe forward problem -- predicting disclination trajectories from given surface\\npatterns -- and an extended inverse problem -- designing surface patterns to\\nproduce a tunable family of disclination curves under varying system\\nparameters. We present an explicit calculation for pattern construction,\\nanalyze parameter limitations and stability constraints, and highlight\\nexperimental and technological applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:54:22Z\"}"}
