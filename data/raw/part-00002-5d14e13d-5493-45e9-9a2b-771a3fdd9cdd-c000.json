{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05144v1\", \"title\": \"Online Cluster-Based Parameter Control for Metaheuristic\", \"summary\": \"The concept of parameter setting is a crucial and significant process in\\nmetaheuristics since it can majorly impact their performance. It is a highly\\ncomplex and challenging procedure since it requires a deep understanding of the\\noptimization algorithm and the optimization problem at hand. In recent years,\\nthe upcoming rise of autonomous decision systems has attracted ongoing\\nscientific interest in this direction, utilizing a considerable number of\\nparameter-tuning methods. There are two types of methods: offline and online.\\nOnline methods usually excel in complex real-world problems, as they can offer\\ndynamic parameter control throughout the execution of the algorithm. The\\npresent work proposes a general-purpose online parameter-tuning method called\\nCluster-Based Parameter Adaptation (CPA) for population-based metaheuristics.\\nThe main idea lies in the identification of promising areas within the\\nparameter search space and in the generation of new parameters around these\\nareas. The method's validity has been demonstrated using the differential\\nevolution algorithm and verified in established test suites of low- and\\nhigh-dimensional problems. The obtained results are statistically analyzed and\\ncompared with state-of-the-art algorithms, including advanced auto-tuning\\napproaches. The analysis reveals the promising solid CPA's performance as well\\nas its robustness under a variety of benchmark problems and dimensions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:48:30Z\"}"}
