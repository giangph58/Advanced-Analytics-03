We\\nintroduce a fast algorithm for azimuthally anisotropic 3D Radon transform with\\nsparsity constraints, allowing effective transformation of seismic volumes\\ncorresponding to arbitrary anisotropic inhomogeneous media. In particular, a 3D\\ndata (CMP) cube of time and offset coordinates is transformed to a 3D cube of\\nintercept time, slowness, and azimuth. The recently proposed generalized\\nFourier slice theorem is employed for very fast calculation of the 3D inverse\\ntransformation and its adjoint, which are subsequently used for efficient\\nimplementation of the sparse transform via a forward-backward splitting\\nalgorithm. The new anisotropic transform improves the temporal resolution of\\nthe resulting seismic data. Furthermore, the Radon transform coefficients\\nallows constructing azimuthally dependent NMO velocity curve at any horizontal\\nplane, which can be inverted for the medium anisotropic parameters. Numerical\\nexamples using synthetic data sets are presented showing the effectiveness of\\nthe proposed anisotropic method in improving seismic processing results\\ncompared with conventional isotropic counterpart.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.geo-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.geo-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T08:23:35Z\"}"}
