The possibility of equatorial superrotation has been\\nstudied in a range of planetary atmospheres, including Earth-like ones, with\\nthe objective of understanding the underlying dynamical processes. However, the\\nbroader impact that this dramatic circulation change would have on the climate\\nsystem is practically unexplored. This is the question we address here. We\\nperform idealized GCM simulations with an imposed equatorial torque to\\ninvestigate how a forced superrotating atmosphere affects surface temperature\\nand the water cycle. We show that these effects are quite large and directly\\nrelated to the global circulation changes, which extend beyond the tropical\\natmosphere. Using tools including a forcing/feedback analysis and a moist\\nenergy balance model, we argue that the dominant mechanism is changes in\\natmospheric energy transport, driven in particular by the collapse of the\\nmeridional overturning circulation, and to a smaller extent by the appearance\\nof an equatorial jet, and the concomitant redistribution of moisture in the\\ntropics, leading to a much weaker relative humidity gradient which has strong\\nradiative effects.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:13:56Z\"}"}
