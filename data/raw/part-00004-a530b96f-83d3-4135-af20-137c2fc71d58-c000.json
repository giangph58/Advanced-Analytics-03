{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10325v1\", \"title\": \"Cumulative-Time Signal Temporal Logic\", \"summary\": \"Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is a widely adopted specification language in\\ncyber-physical systems for expressing critical temporal requirements, such as\\nsafety conditions and response time. However, STL's expressivity is not\\nsufficient to capture the cumulative duration during which a property holds\\nwithin an interval of time. To overcome this limitation, we introduce\\nCumulative-Time Signal Temporal Logic (CT-STL) that operates over discrete-time\\nsignals and extends STL with a new cumulative-time operator. This operator\\ncompares the sum of all time steps for which its nested formula is true with a\\nthreshold. We present both a qualitative and a quantitative (robustness)\\nsemantics for CT-STL and prove both their soundness and completeness\\nproperties. We provide an efficient online monitoring algorithm for both\\nsemantics. Finally, we show the applicability of CT-STL in two case studies:\\nspecifying and monitoring cumulative temporal requirements for a microgrid and\\nan artificial pancreas.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LO\", \"categories\": \"cs.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T15:34:13Z\"}"}
