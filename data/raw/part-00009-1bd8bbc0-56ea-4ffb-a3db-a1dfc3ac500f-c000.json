{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04098v1\", \"title\": \"Satellite-Assisted Low-Altitude Economy Networking: Concepts,\\n  Applications, and Opportunities\", \"summary\": \"The low-altitude economy (LAE) is a new economic paradigm that leverages\\nlow-altitude vehicles (LAVs) to perform diverse missions across diverse areas.\\nTo support the operations of LAE, it is essential to establish LAE networks\\nthat enable LAV management and communications.Existing studies mainly reuse\\nterrestrial networks to construct LAE networks. However, the limited coverage\\nof terrestrial networks poses challenges for serving LAVs in remote areas.\\nBesides, efficient LAV operations also require support such as localization and\\nnavigation, which terrestrial networks designed for communications cannot fully\\nprovide. Due to ubiquitous coverage and diverse functions, satellites are a\\npromising technology to support LAVs. Therefore, this article investigates\\nsatellite-assisted LAE networking. First, we introduce an overview of LAE and\\nsatellites, discussing their features, applications, and architectures. Next,\\nwe investigate opportunities for satellites to assist LAE from aspects of\\ncommunication, control, and computation. As all assistance depends on reliable\\nsatellite-LAV communications, we propose a satellite-assisted LAE framework to\\ntackle issues caused by the severe path loss and high dynamics in\\nsatellite-assisted LAE networks.The case study demonstrates that the\\ndistributed MIMO architecture efficiently reduces the required transmission\\npower and extends service duration, while the two-timescale optimization scheme\\nbalances the performance and control signaling overheads. Specifically, the\\nproposed framework comprises distributed satellite MIMO, distributed LAV MIMO,\\nand a two-timescale optimization scheme.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T03:34:34Z\"}"}
