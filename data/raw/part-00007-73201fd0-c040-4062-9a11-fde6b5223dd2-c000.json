We prove\\nthe finiteness of a stratified de Rham cohomology and obtain its isomorphism to\\nintersection cohomology through establishing a proper duality theory.\\nAdditionally, we present the stratified Poincar\\\\'e duality, the K\\\\\\\"unneth\\ndecomposition theorem and develop stratified structure theory to non-Witt\\nspaces as an application of a theory of stratified mezzoperversities. Our\\nresults connect differential forms, sheaf theory and intersection homology and\\npave the way for new approaches to study singular geometries, as well as\\ntopological invariants on them. Extensions to conical singularities and\\nfibration of complex curves provide examples of the power of this method. This\\ndevelopment will be foundational to new tools in stratified calculus and a\\nstrengthening of Hodge theory, advancing research in the\\nCheeger-Goresky-MacPherson conjecture.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T05:43:49Z\"}"}
