We identify three\\nstructural conditions that, when met by a problem, ensure that a $k$-sized\\nmultiset of maximally-diverse solutions -- measured by the sum of pairwise\\nHamming distances -- can be found in polynomial time. We apply this framework\\nto obtain polynomial time algorithms for finding diverse minimum $s$-$t$ cuts\\nand diverse stable matchings. Moreover, we show that the framework extends to\\ntwo other natural measures of diversity. Lastly, we present a simpler\\nalgorithmic framework for finding a largest set of pairwise disjoint solutions\\nin problems that meet these structural conditions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS,cs.CC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T08:01:41Z\"}"}
