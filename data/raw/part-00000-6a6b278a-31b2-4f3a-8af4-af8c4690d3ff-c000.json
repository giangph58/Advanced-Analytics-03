{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23893v1\", \"title\": \"DiffScale: Continuous Downscaling and Bias Correction of Subseasonal\\n  Wind Speed Forecasts using Diffusion Models\", \"summary\": \"Renewable resources are strongly dependent on local and large-scale weather\\nsituations. Skillful subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) forecasts -- beyond two\\nweeks and up to two months -- can offer significant socioeconomic advantages to\\nthe energy sector. This study aims to enhance wind speed predictions using a\\ndiffusion model with classifier-free guidance to downscale S2S forecasts of\\nsurface wind speed. We propose DiffScale, a diffusion model that super-resolves\\nspatial information for continuous downscaling factors and lead times.\\nLeveraging weather priors as guidance for the generative process of diffusion\\nmodels, we adopt the perspective of conditional probabilities on sampling\\nsuper-resolved S2S forecasts. We aim to directly estimate the density\\nassociated with the target S2S forecasts at different spatial resolutions and\\nlead times without auto-regression or sequence prediction, resulting in an\\nefficient and flexible model. Synthetic experiments were designed to\\nsuper-resolve wind speed S2S forecasts from the European Center for\\nMedium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) from a coarse resolution to a finer\\nresolution of ERA5 reanalysis data, which serves as a high-resolution target.\\nThe innovative aspect of DiffScale lies in its flexibility to downscale\\narbitrary scaling factors, enabling it to generalize across various grid\\nresolutions and lead times -without retraining the model- while correcting\\nmodel errors, making it a versatile tool for improving S2S wind speed\\nforecasts. We achieve a significant improvement in prediction quality,\\noutperforming baselines up to week 3.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.CV,eess.IV\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T09:44:28Z\"}"}
