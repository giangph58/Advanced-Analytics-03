As consequences, we obtain the precise\\nFourier dimensions for multiplicative chaos measures arising from the following\\nkey models: the sub-critical 1D and 2D GMC; the sub-critical $d$-dimensional\\nGMC with $d \\\\ge 3$ when the parameter $\\\\gamma$ is near the critical value; the\\ncanonical Mandelbrot random coverings; the canonical Mandelbrot cascades. For\\nvarious other models, we establish the non-trivial lower bounds of the Fourier\\ndimensions and in various cases we conjecture that they are all optimal and\\nprovide the exact value of the Fourier dimensions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,math-ph,math.DS,math.FA,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:28:11Z\"}"}
