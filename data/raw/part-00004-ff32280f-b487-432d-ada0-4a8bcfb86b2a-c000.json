They treat forecasting as a\\ntime-shift operation, using univariate time series for total bookings and a\\nBayesian Dirichlet Auto-Regressive Moving Average (B-DARMA) model to allocate\\nbookings across trip dates based on lead time. Analysis of Airbnb data shows\\nthat this approach is interpretable, flexible, and potentially more accurate\\nfor forecasting demand across multiple time axes.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T13:49:23Z\"}"}
