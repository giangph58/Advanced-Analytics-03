{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12269v1\", \"title\": \"SEROAISE: Advancing ROA Estimation for ReLU and PWA Dynamics through\\n  Estimating Certified Invariant Sets\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents a novel framework for constructing the Region of\\nAttraction (RoA) for dynamics derived either from Piecewise Affine (PWA)\\nfunctions or from Neural Networks (NNs) with Rectified Linear Units (ReLU)\\nactivation function. This method, described as Sequential Estimation of RoA\\nbased on Invariant Set Estimation (SEROAISE), computes a Lyapunov-like PWA\\nfunction over a certified PWA invariant set. While traditional approaches\\nsearch for Lyapunov functions by enforcing Lyapunov conditions over\\npre-selected domains, this framework enforces Lyapunov-like conditions over a\\ncertified invariant subset obtained using the Iterative Invariant Set\\nEstimator(IISE). Compared to the state-of-the-art, IISE provides systematically\\nlarger certified invariant sets. In order to find a larger invariant subset,\\nthe IISE utilizes a novel concept known as the Non-Uniform Growth of Invariant\\nSet (NUGIS). A number of examples illustrating the efficacy of the proposed\\nmethods are provided, including dynamical systems derived from learning\\nalgorithms. The implementation is publicly available at:\\nhttps://github.com/PouyaSamanipour/SEROAISE.git.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T17:31:47Z\"}"}
