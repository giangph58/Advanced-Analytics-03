While previous studies\\nhave explored HOM interference in quantum metrology, they were mostly limited\\nto one-dimensional scenarios, whereas real-world applications require full 3D\\nspatial resolution. Our approach not only generalizes HOM positioning to\\n3D-achieving ultimate sensitivity as defined by the quantum Cramer-Rao\\nbound-but also stabilizes estimation accuracy through simple polarization\\ntuning, ensuring that the Fisher information remains independent of the\\nestimated parameters. Theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate that our\\nmethod achieves ultra-precise and reliable 3D positioning, even with a limited\\nnumber of detected photons.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T04:01:22Z\"}"}
