The material\\nachieves superior electron mobility (138 cm$^2$/V$\\\\cdot$s at 300 K) through\\ndelocalized Bi-6\\\\textit{p}/S-3\\\\textit{p} networks while maintaining ultralow\\nlattice thermal conductivity (0.40 W/mK at 300 K) via Cu-dominated anharmonic\\nphonon scattering - both optimized along the same crystallographic direction.\\nThis simultaneous optimization originates from the anisotropic bonding\\nhierarchy where [BiSCl$_2$]$_n$ ribbons enable efficient charge transport along\\n\\\\textit{a}-axis, while the soft vibrational modes associated with Cu atoms\\nstrongly scatter heat-carrying phonons. The resulting high power factor (1.71\\nmW/mK$^2$ at 700 K) and peak \\\\textit{ZT} of 1.57 establish CuBiSCl$_2$ as a\\nmodel system that realizes the long-sought \\\"phonon glass-electron crystal\\\"\\nparadigm through crystallographically engineered transport channels.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T03:10:17Z\"}"}
