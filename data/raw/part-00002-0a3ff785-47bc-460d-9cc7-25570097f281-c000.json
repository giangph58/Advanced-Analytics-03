We focus on the interplay between\\ndifferent coherent couplings, which can trigger a structural phase transition,\\nknown as the superradiant phase transition. Our approach, based on band\\nstructure theory and a mean-field description, enables a comprehensive analysis\\nof the nature of the system's excited modes, precursing the phase transitions.\\nBy incorporating dissipative couplings, intrinsic to these systems, we find\\nnon-Hermitian phenomena such as the coalescence of crossing precursor modes and\\nthe emergence of exceptional points (EPs). The general formulation of our model\\nallows us to explain the role of an angle between transverse pump and the\\ncavity deviating from $90^\\\\circ$. This offers us a unified perspective on the\\nplethora of different implementations of such systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas,physics.atom-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T16:43:45Z\"}"}
