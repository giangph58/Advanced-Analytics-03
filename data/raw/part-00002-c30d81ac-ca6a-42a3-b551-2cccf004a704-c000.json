{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21437v1\", \"title\": \"Identifying Critical Dependencies in Large-Scale Continuous Software\\n  Engineering\", \"summary\": \"Continuous Software Engineering (CSE) is widely adopted in the industry,\\nintegrating practices such as Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment\\n(CI/CD). Beyond technical aspects, CSE also encompasses business activities\\nlike continuous planning, budgeting, and operational processes. Coordinating\\nthese activities in large-scale product development involves multiple\\nstakeholders, increasing complexity. This study aims to address this complexity\\nby identifying and analyzing critical dependencies in large-scale CSE. Based on\\n17 semi-structured interviews conducted at two Nordic fintech companies, our\\npreliminary findings indicate that dependencies between software teams and\\nsupport functions, as well as between software teams and external entities, are\\nthe primary sources of delays and bottlenecks. As a next step, we plan to\\nfurther refine our understanding of critical dependencies in large-scale CSE\\nand explore coordination mechanisms that can better support software\\ndevelopment teams in managing these challenges.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T08:52:32Z\"}"}
