{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03454v1\", \"title\": \"Simulation-based performance comparison of varied pitch sizes GEM\\n  detectors\", \"summary\": \"Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) detectors, typically featuring a standard pitch\\nsize of 140 $\\\\mu$m and an inner hole diameter of 50 $\\\\mu$m, are extensively\\nutilized in high-energy physics experiments for tracking, triggering, and\\ntiming measurements. Their characteristics, such as high gain, good position\\nresolution, improved temporal resolution, low discharge probability, radiation\\nhardness, and high rate capabilities, make them highly favoured. Recent\\nexperimental studies have shown that triple-GEM detectors with a reduced pitch\\nsize of 90 $\\\\mu$m and a smaller hole diameter of 40 $\\\\mu$m can perform better\\nthan standard-pitch GEM detectors. To assess the effectiveness of these reduced\\ndimensions, we conducted a simulation-based study using ANSYS and Garfield++.\\nAs a first step, we validated the simulation framework by modelling a standard\\nsingle GEM detector and comparing the results with previous simulations and\\nexperimental data. Following validation, we designed GEM structures with\\nreduced pitch sizes of 90 $\\\\mu$m and 60 $\\\\mu$m. We then performed a comparative\\nanalysis, focusing on key performance parameters like effective gain, electron\\ntransparency, and position resolution. These parameters were varied against an\\nincrease in GEM potential, drift electric field, induction electric field,\\ndrift gap, induction gap, and gas composition to optimize the performance of\\nthe detectors.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T11:51:45Z\"}"}
