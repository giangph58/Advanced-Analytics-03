{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05356v1\", \"title\": \"Time of the Flight of the Gaussians: Optimizing Depth Indirectly in\\n  Dynamic Radiance Fields\", \"summary\": \"We present a method to reconstruct dynamic scenes from monocular\\ncontinuous-wave time-of-flight (C-ToF) cameras using raw sensor samples that\\nachieves similar or better accuracy than neural volumetric approaches and is\\n100x faster. Quickly achieving high-fidelity dynamic 3D reconstruction from a\\nsingle viewpoint is a significant challenge in computer vision. In C-ToF\\nradiance field reconstruction, the property of interest-depth-is not directly\\nmeasured, causing an additional challenge. This problem has a large and\\nunderappreciated impact upon the optimization when using a fast primitive-based\\nscene representation like 3D Gaussian splatting, which is commonly used with\\nmulti-view data to produce satisfactory results and is brittle in its\\noptimization otherwise. We incorporate two heuristics into the optimization to\\nimprove the accuracy of scene geometry represented by Gaussians. Experimental\\nresults show that our approach produces accurate reconstructions under\\nconstrained C-ToF sensing conditions, including for fast motions like swinging\\nbaseball bats. https://visual.cs.brown.edu/gftorf\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GR\", \"categories\": \"cs.GR,cs.AI,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:45:53Z\"}"}
