{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19502v1\", \"title\": \"Simultaneous Pick and Place Detection by Combining SE(3) Diffusion\\n  Models with Differential Kinematics\", \"summary\": \"Grasp detection methods typically target the detection of a set of\\nfree-floating hand poses that can grasp the object. However, not all of the\\ndetected grasp poses are executable due to physical constraints. Even though it\\nis straightforward to filter invalid grasp poses in the post-process, such a\\ntwo-staged approach is computationally inefficient, especially when the\\nconstraint is hard. In this work, we propose an approach to take the following\\ntwo constraints into account during the grasp detection stage, namely, (i) the\\npicked object must be able to be placed with a predefined configuration without\\nin-hand manipulation (ii) it must be reachable by the robot under the joint\\nlimit and collision-avoidance constraints for both pick and place cases. Our\\nkey idea is to train an SE(3) grasp diffusion network to estimate the noise in\\nthe form of spatial velocity, and constrain the denoising process by a\\nmulti-target differential inverse kinematics with an inequality constraint, so\\nthat the states are guaranteed to be reachable and placement can be performed\\nwithout collision. In addition to an improved success ratio, we experimentally\\nconfirmed that our approach is more efficient and consistent in computation\\ntime compared to a naive two-stage approach.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T05:49:59Z\"}"}
