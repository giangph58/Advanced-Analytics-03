This is primarily due to the paucity of datasets containing\\nheterogeneous sensor setups among the CAVs. The recently released SCOPE\\ndatasets address this issue by providing data from three different LiDAR\\nsensors for each CAV. This study is the first to tackle the Sensor2Sensor\\ndomain gap in vehicle to vehicle (V2V) collective perception. First, we present\\nour sensor-domain robust architecture S2S-Net. Then an in-depth analysis of the\\nSensor2Sensor domain adaptation capabilities of S2S-Net on the SCOPE dataset is\\nconducted. S2S-Net demonstrates the capability to maintain very high\\nperformance in unseen sensor domains and achieved state-of-the-art results on\\nthe SCOPE dataset.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T09:38:59Z\"}"}
