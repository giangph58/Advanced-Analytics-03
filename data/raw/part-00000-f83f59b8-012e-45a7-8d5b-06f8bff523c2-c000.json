Two different versions of the proton-neutron quasi\\nparticle random phase (pn-QRPA) model were employed to compute $\\\\beta$-decay\\nrates and half-lives for the N = 126 isotones. The first set of calculation\\nsolves the pn-QRPA equations using the schematic model (SM) approach. The\\nWoods-Saxon potential was employed as a mean-field basis. A spherical shape\\nassigned for each waiting point nuclei throughout all simulations. Both allowed\\nGamow-Teller (GT) and first-forbidden (FF) transitions were considered in the\\nparticle-hole (ph) channel. The second set uses the pn-QRPA model in deformed\\nNilsson basis to calculate $\\\\beta$-decay rates for allowed GT and unique\\nfirst-forbidden (U1F) transitions under terrestrial and stellar conditions. Our\\nresults are in agreement with shell model findings that first-forbidden\\ntransitions lead to a considerable decrement in the calculated half-lives of\\nthe isotones. Inclusion of the first-forbidden contribution led to a decent\\nagreement of our computed terrestrial $\\\\beta$-decay half-lives with measured\\nones, much better than the previous calculations. The possible implication of\\nthe waiting point nuclei on r-process nucleosynthesis is discussed briefly.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T06:11:35Z\"}"}
