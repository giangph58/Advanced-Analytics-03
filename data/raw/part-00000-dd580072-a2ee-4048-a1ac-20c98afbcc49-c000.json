{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12665v1\", \"title\": \"Predicting Driver's Perceived Risk: a Model Based on Semi-Supervised\\n  Learning Strategy\", \"summary\": \"Drivers' perception of risk determines their acceptance, trust, and use of\\nthe Automated Driving Systems (ADSs). However, perceived risk is subjective and\\ndifficult to evaluate using existing methods. To address this issue, a driver's\\nsubjective perceived risk (DSPR) model is proposed, regarding perceived risk as\\na dynamically triggered mechanism with anisotropy and attenuation. 20\\nparticipants are recruited for a driver-in-the-loop experiment to report their\\nreal-time subjective risk ratings (SRRs) when experiencing various automatic\\ndriving scenarios. A convolutional neural network and bidirectional long\\nshort-term memory network with temporal pattern attention (CNN-Bi-LSTM-TPA) is\\nembedded into a semi-supervised learning strategy to predict SRRs, aiming to\\nreduce data noise caused by subjective randomness of participants. The results\\nillustrate that DSPR achieves the highest prediction accuracy of 87.91% in\\npredicting SRRs, compared to three state-of-the-art risk models. The\\nsemi-supervised strategy improves accuracy by 20.12%. Besides, CNN-Bi-LSTM-TPA\\nnetwork presents the highest accuracy among four different LSTM structures.\\nThis study offers an effective method for assessing driver's perceived risk,\\nproviding support for the safety enhancement of ADS and driver's trust\\nimprovement.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T05:50:33Z\"}"}
