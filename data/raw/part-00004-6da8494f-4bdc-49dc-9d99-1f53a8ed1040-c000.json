{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07748v1\", \"title\": \"Versatile ultrafast single-shot imaging\", \"summary\": \"Ultrafast single-shot imaging techniques now reach frame rates of tens of\\ntera-frame-per-second (Tfps) and long sequence depths but are often too complex\\nfor large-scale use, both in terms of image acquisition and reconstruction. We\\npropose an extremely simple yet high-performance method that leverages the\\ncapabilities of two prominent technologies: acousto-optical pulse shaping and\\nlight-field based hyperspectral imaging. We demonstrate the capabilities of the\\ntechnique by capturing laser-induced phenomena at frame rates on par with the\\nstate-of-the-art, and with the potential to reach the peta-frame-per-second,\\nwhile keeping a versatile setup that is easily adaptable to various input pulse\\nshapes and dynamic events. Furthermore, an extra degree of freedom is added to\\nthe system through the use of digital in-line holography on the single-shot\\nmotion pictures. The agility and performance of this technique could then open\\nup new horizons for single-shot imaging techniques, making them accessible to a\\nwider community.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T13:44:33Z\"}"}
