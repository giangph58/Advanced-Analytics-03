{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15146v1\", \"title\": \"Behavioral Universe Network (BUN): A Behavioral Information-Based\\n  Framework for Complex Systems\", \"summary\": \"Modern digital ecosystems feature complex, dynamic interactions among\\nautonomous entities across diverse domains. Traditional models often separate\\nagents and objects, lacking a unified foundation to capture their interactive\\nbehaviors. This paper introduces the Behavioral Universe Network (BUN), a\\ntheoretical framework grounded in the Agent-Interaction-Behavior (AIB)\\nformalism. BUN treats subjects (active agents), objects (resources), and\\nbehaviors (operations) as first-class entities, all governed by a shared\\nBehavioral Information Base (BIB). We detail the AIB core concepts and\\ndemonstrate how BUN leverages information-driven triggers, semantic enrichment,\\nand adaptive rules to coordinate multi-agent systems. We highlight key\\nbenefits: enhanced behavior analysis, strong adaptability, and cross-domain\\ninteroperability. We conclude by positioning BUN as a promising foundation for\\nnext-generation digital governance and intelligent applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T14:50:28Z\"}"}
