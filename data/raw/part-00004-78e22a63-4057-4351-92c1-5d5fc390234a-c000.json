{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11347v1\", \"title\": \"DeepWheel: Generating a 3D Synthetic Wheel Dataset for Design and\\n  Performance Evaluation\", \"summary\": \"Data-driven design is emerging as a powerful strategy to accelerate\\nengineering innovation. However, its application to vehicle wheel design\\nremains limited due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets that\\ninclude 3D geometry and physical performance metrics. To address this gap, this\\nstudy proposes a synthetic design-performance dataset generation framework\\nusing generative AI. The proposed framework first generates 2D rendered images\\nusing Stable Diffusion, and then reconstructs the 3D geometry through 2.5D\\ndepth estimation. Structural simulations are subsequently performed to extract\\nengineering performance data. To further expand the design and performance\\nspace, topology optimization is applied, enabling the generation of a more\\ndiverse set of wheel designs. The final dataset, named DeepWheel, consists of\\nover 6,000 photo-realistic images and 900 structurally analyzed 3D models. This\\nmulti-modal dataset serves as a valuable resource for surrogate model training,\\ndata-driven inverse design, and design space exploration. The proposed\\nmethodology is also applicable to other complex design domains.
