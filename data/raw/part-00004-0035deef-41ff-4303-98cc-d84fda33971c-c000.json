A $p$-lima\\\\c{c}on curve is a planar\\ncurve parametrized by $t$ given by $a(\\\\cos t,\\\\sin t)+b(\\\\cos pt, \\\\sin pt)$,\\nwhere $a,b\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$, $p \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}$, and $t \\\\in [0,2\\\\pi]$. We study\\n$N$-body choreographic motions constrained to a $p$-lima\\\\c{c}on curve and\\nestablish necessary and sufficient conditions for their existence.\\nSpecifically, we prove that choreographic motions exist if and only if $p/N, (p\\n\\\\pm 1)/N \\\\notin \\\\mathbb{Z}$. Under an additional symmetry assumption on the\\nforce coefficients, we further refine these conditions. We also analyze the\\noccurrence of collisions, showing that for given $p$ and $N$, at most $2(N-1)$\\nchoices of $a/b$ lead to collisions. Furthermore, we find additional conserved\\nquantities.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:55:21Z\"}"}
