This direction is of importance in the\\ncontext of DUNE sub-GeV atmospheric oscillation studies. MicroBooNE allows for\\na data-driven quantification of this resolution by investigating the deviation\\nof the reconstructed muon-proton system orientation with respect to the\\nwell-known direction of neutrinos originating from the Booster Neutrino Beam\\nwith an exposure of 1.3 x 1021 protons on target. Using simulation studies, we\\nderive the expected sub-GeV DUNE atmospheric-neutrino reconstructed simulated\\nspectrum by developing a reweighting scheme as a function of the true neutrino\\nenergy. We further report flux-integrated single- and double-differential cross\\nsection measurements of charged-current {\\\\nu}{\\\\mu} quasielastic-like scattering\\non argon as a function of the muon-proton system angle using the full\\nMicroBooNE data sets. We also demonstrate the sensitivity of these results to\\nnuclear effects and final state hadronic reinteraction modeling.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T17:20:49Z\"}"}
