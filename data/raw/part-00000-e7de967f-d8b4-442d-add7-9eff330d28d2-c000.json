{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04844v1\", \"title\": \"Embracing Dynamics: Dynamics-aware 4D Gaussian Splatting SLAM\", \"summary\": \"Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology now has\\nphotorealistic mapping capabilities thanks to the real-time high-fidelity\\nrendering capability of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS). However, due to the\\nstatic representation of scenes, current 3DGS-based SLAM encounters issues with\\npose drift and failure to reconstruct accurate maps in dynamic environments. To\\naddress this problem, we present D4DGS-SLAM, the first SLAM method based on\\n4DGS map representation for dynamic environments. By incorporating the temporal\\ndimension into scene representation, D4DGS-SLAM enables high-quality\\nreconstruction of dynamic scenes. Utilizing the dynamics-aware InfoModule, we\\ncan obtain the dynamics, visibility, and reliability of scene points, and\\nfilter stable static points for tracking accordingly. When optimizing Gaussian\\npoints, we apply different isotropic regularization terms to Gaussians with\\nvarying dynamic characteristics. Experimental results on real-world dynamic\\nscene datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art\\napproaches in both camera pose tracking and map quality.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T08:56:35Z\"}"}
