There are by now several\\ncomplementary procedures for extracting the associated generalized symmetry\\ndata from orbifolds of the form $\\\\mathbb{R}^6 / \\\\Gamma$, including methods\\nbased on the boundary topology of the asymptotic geometry, as well as the\\nadjacency matrix for fermionic degrees of freedom in the quiver gauge theory of\\nprobe branes. In this paper we show that this match between the two methods\\nalso works in non-supersymmetric and discrete torsion backgrounds. In\\nparticular, a refinement of geometric boundary data based on Chen-Ruan\\ncohomology matches the expected answer based on quiver data. Additionally, we\\nalso show that free (i.e., non-torsion) factors count the number of\\nhigher-dimensional branes which couple to the localized singularity. We use\\nthis to also extract quadratic pairing terms in the associated symmetry theory\\n(SymTh) for these systems, and explain how these considerations generalize to a\\nbroader class of backgrounds.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,math.AT,math.RT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:59:55Z\"}"}
