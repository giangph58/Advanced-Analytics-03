Here, we introduce a\\nnon-orientable momentum space isomorphic to the real projective plane RP^2\\nwithin the low-symmetry media. We show that the local band fluidity can be\\ncharacterized by an expanded dihedral group with non-Abelian properties, while\\nthe global band fluidity offers a versatile platform to explore the evolution\\nof non-Hermitian exceptional manifolds, including order-1, higher-order, hybrid\\nexceptional manifolds, diabolic points and even bound states in the continuum.\\nFurthermore, the non-orientable momentum space can pave the way for exploring\\nthe emergence of phenomena for exceptional manifolds.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T04:15:07Z\"}"}
