{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07714v1\", \"title\": \"Quasi-Periodic Pulsations in Ionospheric TEC Synchronized with Solar\\n  Flare EUV Emission\", \"summary\": \"The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray radiation emitted during solar flares\\nhas been shown to significantly increase the electron density of the Earth's\\nionosphere. During flares, quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) in X-ray flux\\noriginating in the corona have previously been linked to subsequent pulsations\\nin the Earth's ionospheric D-region. Similar pulsations have been detected in\\nchromospheric EUV emission, although their impact on the Earth's ionosphere has\\nnot previously been investigated. Here, for the first time, synchronous\\npulsations were detected in solar EUV emission and ionospheric Total Electron\\nContent (TEC) measurements. Using wavelet and periodogram analysis, we detect\\nQPPs with approximately 85 second periods in chromospheric EUV emission lines\\n(He II 304 \\\\AA{}, C III 977 \\\\AA{} and H I 972 \\\\AA{}) from the Solar Dynamics\\nObservatory Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (SDO/EVE) during the\\nimpulsive phase of an X5.4 flare on March 7, 2012. These lines contribute to\\nionization in the ionospheric E- and F-regions, resulting in subsequent\\nvariations of electron density with the same periodicity, which was detected in\\nTEC measurements. This work demonstrates that the Earth's ionosphere is\\nresponsive to fine-scale fluctuations in EUV emission during flares, with a\\ntime delay of approximately 30 seconds found. These findings may have\\napplications in atmospheric modelling and solar-terrestrial studies, including\\nthe calculation of ionospheric recombination rates.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T13:05:45Z\"}"}
