{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02533v1\", \"title\": \"ARCANE: Adaptive RISC-V Cache Architecture for Near-memory Extensions\", \"summary\": \"Modern data-driven applications expose limitations of von Neumann\\narchitectures - extensive data movement, low throughput, and poor energy\\nefficiency. Accelerators improve performance but lack flexibility and require\\ndata transfers. Existing compute in- and near-memory solutions mitigate these\\nissues but face usability challenges due to data placement constraints. We\\npropose a novel cache architecture that doubles as a tightly-coupled\\ncompute-near-memory coprocessor. Our \\\\riscv cache controller executes custom\\ninstructions from the host CPU using vector operations dispatched to\\nnear-memory vector processing units within the cache memory subsystem. This\\narchitecture abstracts memory synchronization and data mapping from application\\nsoftware while offering software-based \\\\isa extensibility. Our implementation\\nshows $30\\\\times$ to $84\\\\times$ performance improvement when operating on 8-bit\\ndata over the same system with a traditional cache when executing a worst-case\\n32-bit CNN workload, with only $41.3\\\\%$ area overhead.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AR\", \"categories\": \"cs.AR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T12:36:01Z\"}"}
