We introduce the Dodecacopter, a new type of modular\\nrotorcraft where all modules take the shape of a regular dodecahedron, allowing\\nthe creation of richer sets of configurations beyond flight arrays. In\\nparticular, we show how the chosen module design can be used to create\\nthree-dimensional and fully actuated configurations. We justify the relevance\\nof these types of configurations in terms of their structural and actuation\\nproperties with various performance indicators. Given the broad range of\\nconfigurations and capabilities that can be achieved with our proposed design,\\nwe formulate tractable optimization programs to find optimal configurations\\ngiven structural and actuation constraints. Finally, a prototype of such a\\nvehicle is presented along with results of performed flights in multiple\\nconfigurations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T07:38:00Z\"}"}
