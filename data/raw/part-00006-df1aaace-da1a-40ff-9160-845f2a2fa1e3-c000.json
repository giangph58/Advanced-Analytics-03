{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02685v1\", \"title\": \"STOOD-X methodology: using statistical nonparametric test for OOD\\n  Detection Large-Scale datasets enhanced with explainability\", \"summary\": \"Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task in machine learning,\\nparticularly in safety-sensitive applications where model failures can have\\nserious consequences. However, current OOD detection methods often suffer from\\nrestrictive distributional assumptions, limited scalability, and a lack of\\ninterpretability. To address these challenges, we propose STOOD-X, a two-stage\\nmethodology that combines a Statistical nonparametric Test for OOD Detection\\nwith eXplainability enhancements. In the first stage, STOOD-X uses\\nfeature-space distances and a Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test to identify OOD\\nsamples without assuming a specific feature distribution. In the second stage,\\nit generates user-friendly, concept-based visual explanations that reveal the\\nfeatures driving each decision, aligning with the BLUE XAI paradigm. Through\\nextensive experiments on benchmark datasets and multiple architectures, STOOD-X\\nachieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art post hoc OOD\\ndetectors, particularly in high-dimensional and complex settings. In addition,\\nits explainability framework enables human oversight, bias detection, and model\\ndebugging, fostering trust and collaboration between humans and AI systems. The\\nSTOOD-X methodology therefore offers a robust, explainable, and scalable\\nsolution for real-world OOD detection tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.HC,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:26:03Z\"}"}
