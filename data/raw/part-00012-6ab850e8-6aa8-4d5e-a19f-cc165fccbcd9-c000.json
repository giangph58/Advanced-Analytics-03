This prompts investigations\\ninto how fast such variability can be. Conventionally, the data are often\\nbinned to examine the time variability such that the measurement in each bin is\\nabove the minimum detectable polarization (MDP). Here we demonstrate that this\\nis unnecessary, and even below the MDP, one can infer the posterior\\ndistribution of PA reliably using the Bayesian approach and still be able to\\nplace useful constraints on the physics in many cases. With this approach, we\\ndiscovered that the PA variation in one of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry\\nExplorer (IXPE) observations of GX 13+1 is not following a linear rotation mode\\nas suggested previously. Instead, the PA swings between two discrete angles,\\nsuggesting that there are two emitting components, e.g., the boundary layer and\\nthe spreading layer, competing with each other. Also in one of the observations\\nof GX 13+1 and Sco X-1, the PA is found to vary in correlation with the source\\ncount rate, indicating that the mass accretion rate is shaping the corona\\nproperties. Also, during the IXPE observation of Sco X-1, the PA in highest\\nflux level seems to deviate from the averaged value and appear to be consistent\\nwith previous measurement results with PolarLight and OSO-8.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T07:09:08Z\"}"}
