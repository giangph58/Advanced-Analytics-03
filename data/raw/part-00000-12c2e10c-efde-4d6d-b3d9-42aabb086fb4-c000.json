The large land areas required to fulfil the conservation target and\\nthe quick schedule of implementation challenge both the current policy\\ninstruments and public funding for conservation. We introduce a deferrence\\nmechanism for forest conservation by using procurement auctions. Deferring the\\nconservation payments allows the government to conserve large areas in a\\nquicker schedule and distributing the financial burden of conservation cost for\\na longer period of time. The deferred payments are paid an interest. The\\ninterest earning and an auction mechanism for downpayments strengthens the\\nincentives for landowners to take part in conservation. We characterize the\\ngeneral properties of the mechanism and run numerical simulations to find that\\nthe deferrence mechanism facilitates a quick conservation of stands and thereby\\nminimizes the loss of ecologically valuable sites caused by harvesting risks.\\nThe analysis suggests that keeping the lending period no longer than 10 years\\nand paying a 3% interest rate provides a compromise that works rather well and\\noutperforms the up-front mechanism in most cases.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T11:13:17Z\"}"}
