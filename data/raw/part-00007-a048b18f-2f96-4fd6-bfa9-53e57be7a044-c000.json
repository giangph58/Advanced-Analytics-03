{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07576v1\", \"title\": \"An exceptional story: Symmetries and dualities between Maximal\\n  supergravity and General relativity\", \"summary\": \"We present the historical path from General relativity to the construction of\\nMaximal $\\\\mathcal{N}_4 = 8$ Supergravity with a detour in D=10 and 11\\ndimensions. The supergravities obtained by toric dimensional reduction and/or\\nby reducing the number of supersymmetry generators have large exceptional\\nduality symmetry groups and exhibit a remarkably uniform pattern across all\\nvalues of $\\\\mathcal{N}_D$ and D. In particular (bosonic) General relativity\\nfits in as the simplest case and anchors us to the Real world. Dimensional\\nreduction to 2 dimensions brings us to affine Kac-Moody groups and their\\nsemi-direct products with a real form of the Witt algebra: there is \\\"integrable\\nMagics\\\". Integrability of 4D Gravity and of its reduction to 2D is considered\\nwith their \\\"Twisted self-duality\\\". Hyperbolic Kac-Moody symmetries appear after\\nreduction to 1D: this leads to \\\"chaotic Magics\\\". We then discover\\n\\\"Borcherds\\\"-Kac-Moody symmetries that allow us to rewrite in any dimension all\\nmatter equations of motion as Twisted self-duality: \\\"Algebraic geometric\\nMagics\\\". Finally a \\\"BF\\\" metasymmetry $\\\\Sigma$ exchanges negative quartets of\\nFermionic dimensions with Bosonic ones inside two Magic triangles. A third\\nubiquitous triangle of symmetries from Invariant theory resists unification\\ndespite its strong resemblance to the others. The prospective remarks include\\nseven Challenges.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T09:20:24Z\"}"}
