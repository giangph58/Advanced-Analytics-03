However, a significant research\\ngap exists in the field of input design for nonlinear dynamic system\\nidentification. In particular, existing methods largely overlook the\\nminimization of the generalization error, i.e., model inaccuracies in regions\\nnot covered by the estimation dataset. This work addresses this gap by\\nproposing an input design method that embeds a novel optimality criterion\\nwithin a receding horizon control (RHC)-based optimization framework. The\\ndistance-based optimality criterion induces a space-filling design within a\\nuser-defined region of interest in a surrogate model's input space, requiring\\nonly minimal prior knowledge. Additionally, the method is applicable both\\nonline, where model parameters are continuously updated based on process\\nobservations, and offline, where a fixed model is employed. The space-filling\\nperformance of the proposed strategy is evaluated on an artificial example and\\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior efficiency in\\nexploring process operating spaces.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:50:52Z\"}"}
