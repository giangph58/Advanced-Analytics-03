The derivative is defined in\\nterms of the logarithmic spin tensor, which is a skew-symmetric tensor/matrix\\ngiven by a relatively complex formula. Using a newly developed commutator based\\nfunctional calculus, we derive a new representation formula for the logarithmic\\nspin tensor. In addition to the result on the logarithmic corotational\\nderivative we also use the newly developed functional calculus to answer some\\nproblems regarding the matrix logarithm and the monotonicity of stress-strain\\nrelations. These results document that the commutator based functional calculus\\nis of general use in tensor/matrix analysis, and that the calculus allows one\\nto seamlessly work with tensor/matrix valued functions and their derivatives.\", \"main_category\": \"math-ph\", \"categories\": \"math-ph,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T08:17:22Z\"}"}
