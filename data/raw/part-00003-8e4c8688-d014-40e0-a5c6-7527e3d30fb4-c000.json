To address this gap, we conducted qualitative\\nresearch on decision-making within a law enforcement agency. Our study aimed to\\nidentify limitations of existing practices, explore user requirements and\\nunderstand the responsibilities that humans expect to undertake in these\\nsystems.\\n  Participants in our study highlighted the need for a system capable of\\nprocessing and analysing large volumes of data efficiently to help in crime\\ndetection and prevention. Additionally, the system should satisfy requirements\\nfor scalability, accuracy, justification, trustworthiness and adaptability to\\nbe adopted in this domain. Participants also emphasised the importance of\\nhaving end users review the input data that might be challenging for AI to\\ninterpret, and validate the generated output to ensure the system's accuracy.\\nTo keep up with the evolving nature of the law enforcement domain, end users\\nneed to help the system adapt to the changes in criminal behaviour and\\ngovernment guidance, and technical experts need to regularly oversee and\\nmonitor the system. Furthermore, user-friendly human interaction with the\\nsystem is essential for its adoption and some of the participants confirmed\\nthey would be happy to be in the loop and provide necessary feedback that the\\nsystem can learn from. Finally, we argue that it is very unlikely that the\\nsystem will ever achieve full automation due to the dynamic and complex nature\\nof the law enforcement domain.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY,cs.AI,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T09:25:29Z\"}"}
