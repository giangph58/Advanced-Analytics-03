{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21551v1\", \"title\": \"Euclidean interval objects in categories with finite products\", \"summary\": \"Based on the intuitive notion of convexity, we formulate a universal property\\ndefining interval objects in a category with finite products. Interval objects\\nare structures corresponding to closed intervals of the real line, but their\\ndefinition does not assume a pre-existing notion of real number. The universal\\nproperty characterises such structures up to isomorphism, supports the\\ndefinition of functions between intervals, and provides a means of verifying\\nidentities between functions. In the category of sets, the universal property\\ncharacterises closed intervals of real numbers with nonempty interior. In the\\nthe category of topological spaces, we obtain intervals with the Euclidean\\ntopology. We also prove that every elementary topos with natural numbers object\\ncontains an interval object; furthermore, we characterise interval objects as\\nintervals of real numbers in the Cauchy completion of the rational numbers\\nwithin the Dedekind reals.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CT\", \"categories\": \"math.CT,math.GN\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T11:49:27Z\"}"}
