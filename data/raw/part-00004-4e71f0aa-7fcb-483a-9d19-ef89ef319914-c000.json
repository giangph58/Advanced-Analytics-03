{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10907v1\", \"title\": \"Evidence for GeV Gamma-Ray Emission from Intense GRB 240529A During the\\n  Afterglow's Shallow Decay Phase\", \"summary\": \"X-ray light curves of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows exhibit various\\nfeatures, with the shallow decay phase being particularly puzzling. While some\\nstudies report absence of the X-ray shallow decay for hyper-energetic GRBs,\\nrecently discovered GRB 240529A shows a clear shallow decay phase with an\\nisotropic gamma-ray energy of \\\\SI{2.2e54}{erg}, making it a highly unusual case\\ncompared to typical GRBs. In order to investigate the physical mechanism of the\\nshallow decay, we perform the \\\\textit{Fermi}-LAT analysis of GRB 240529A along\\nwith \\\\textit{Swift}-XRT analysis. We find no jet break feature in the X-ray\\nlight curve and then give the lower bound of the collimation-corrected jet\\nenergy of $>10^{52}$~erg, which is close to the maximum rotational energy of a\\nmagnetar. Our LAT data analysis reveals evidence of GeV emission with a\\nstatistical significance of $4.5\\\\sigma$ during the shallow decay phase, which\\ncan be interpreted as the first case for hyper-energetic GRBs with a typical\\nshallow decay phase. The GeV to keV flux ratio is calculated to be $4.2\\\\pm2.3$.\\nTogether with X-ray spectral index, this indicates an inverse Compton origin of\\nthe GeV emission. Multiwavelength modeling based on time-dependent simulations\\ntested two promising models, the energy injection and wind models. Both models\\ncan explain the X-ray and gamma-ray data, while our modeling demonstrates that\\ngamma-ray observations, along with future GeV--TeV observations by CTAO, will\\ndistinguish between them.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T06:39:53Z\"}"}
