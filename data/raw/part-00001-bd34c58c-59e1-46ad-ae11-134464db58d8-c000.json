Given a vector\\n$\\\\mathfrak{c}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}^n$, the ideal $I_{\\\\mathfrak{c}}$ is the ideal\\ngenerated by those monomials belonging to $I$ whose exponent vectors are\\ncomponentwise bounded above by $\\\\mathfrak{c}$. Let $\\\\delta_{\\\\mathfrak{c}}(I)$\\nbe the largest integer $q$ for which $(I^q)_{\\\\mathfrak{c}}\\\\neq 0$. For a finite\\ngraph $G$, its edge ideal is denoted by $I(G)$. Let\\n$\\\\mathcal{B}(\\\\mathfrak{c},G)$ be the toric ring which is generated by the\\nmonomials belonging to the minimal system of monomial generators of\\n$(I(G)^{\\\\delta_{\\\\mathfrak{c}}(I)})_{\\\\mathfrak{c}}$. In a previous work, the\\nauthors proved that $(I(G)^{\\\\delta_{\\\\mathfrak{c}}(I)})_{\\\\mathfrak{c}}$ is a\\npolymatroidal ideal. It follows that $\\\\mathcal{B}(\\\\mathfrak{c},G)$ is a normal\\nCohen--Macaulay domain. In this paper, we study the Gorenstein property of\\n$\\\\mathcal{B}(\\\\mathfrak{c},G)$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AC\", \"categories\": \"math.AC,math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T16:00:19Z\"}"}
