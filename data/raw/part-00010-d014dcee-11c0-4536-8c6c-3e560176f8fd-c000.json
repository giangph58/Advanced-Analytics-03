{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03359v1\", \"title\": \"Domain Adversarial Training for Mitigating Gender Bias in Speech-based\\n  Mental Health Detection\", \"summary\": \"Speech-based AI models are emerging as powerful tools for detecting\\ndepression and the presence of Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), offering\\na non-invasive and cost-effective way to assess mental health. However, these\\nmodels often struggle with gender bias, which can lead to unfair and inaccurate\\npredictions. In this study, our study addresses this issue by introducing a\\ndomain adversarial training approach that explicitly considers gender\\ndifferences in speech-based depression and PTSD detection. Specifically, we\\ntreat different genders as distinct domains and integrate this information into\\na pretrained speech foundation model. We then validate its effectiveness on the\\nE-DAIC dataset to assess its impact on performance. Experimental results show\\nthat our method notably improves detection performance, increasing the F1-score\\nby up to 13.29 percentage points compared to the baseline. This highlights the\\nimportance of addressing demographic disparities in AI-driven mental health\\nassessment.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T09:29:14Z\"}"}
