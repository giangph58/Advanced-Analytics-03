A natural approach is to\\nperform consecutive measurements, raising a key question: How does the\\ninformation gained from the first measurement compare to that from both? The\\nconsecutive measurement theorem provides a general relation between these\\nquantities and has been used in quantum proofs of knowledge and nonlocal games.\\nHowever, its previous formulations are often too loose to yield meaningful\\nbounds, especially in quantum nonlocal games. Here, we establish a tight\\nversion of the theorem and apply it to improve the best-known bounds on the\\nquantum value of $\\\\text{CHSH}_q(p)$ games and their parallel repetition. We\\nalso present a novel application of the theorem to obtain a tighter trade-offs\\nbound in quantum oblivious transfer for certain regimes. These results enhance\\nthe theoretical tools for analyzing quantum advantage and have concrete\\nimplications for nonlocal games and quantum cryptographic protocols.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T08:47:29Z\"}"}
