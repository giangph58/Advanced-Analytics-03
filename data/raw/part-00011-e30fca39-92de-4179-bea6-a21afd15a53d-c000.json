Most current sound-searching systems rely on\\npre-annotated audio labels created by humans, which can be time-consuming to\\nproduce and prone to inaccuracies, limiting the efficiency of audio production.\\nFollowing the recent advancement of contrastive language-audio pre-training\\n(CLAP) models, we explore an alternative CLAP-based sound-searching system\\n(CLAP-UI) that does not rely on human annotations. To evaluate the\\neffectiveness of CLAP-UI, we conducted comparative experiments with a widely\\nused sound effect searching platform, the BBC Sound Effect Library. Our study\\nevaluates user performance, cognitive load, and satisfaction through\\necologically valid tasks based on professional sound-searching workflows. Our\\nresult shows that CLAP-UI demonstrated significantly enhanced productivity and\\nreduced frustration while maintaining comparable cognitive demands. We also\\nqualitatively analyzed the participants' feedback, which offered valuable\\nperspectives on the design of future AI-assisted sound search systems.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.AS\", \"categories\": \"eess.AS,cs.SD\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T04:20:12Z\"}"}
