The\\nchanges in the band gap size and its dependence on the $x$ value was\\ninvestigated. The band gap was found to be of indirect nature and it decreases\\nwith increasing I content as long as the system is in the $P\\\\overline{3}m1$\\nphase. A clear non-linear dependence of the band gap size on $x$ was\\nestablished which is in qualitative and quantitative agreement with reported\\nexperimental data. The quasi-rigid band behavior of the states in the valence\\nand conduction bands of the $P\\\\overline{3}m1$ phase is discussed since no\\nsignificant changes in the shape of the total density of unoccupied states were\\nobserved upon the isovalent substitution.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T10:41:42Z\"}"}
