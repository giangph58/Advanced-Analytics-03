Natural disasters, human-caused\\nincidents such as terrorist attacks, and technological failures can result in\\nsignificant damage, fatalities, injuries, and economic losses. The increasing\\nfrequency and severity of disruptive events in the United States highlight the\\nurgent need for effectively allocating resources in homeland security and\\nemergency preparedness. This article presents an optimization-based decision\\nsupport model to help homeland security policymakers identify and select\\nprojects that best mitigate the risk of threats and hazards while satisfying a\\nbudget constraint. The model incorporates multiple hazards, probabilistic risk\\nassessments, and multidimensional consequences and integrates historical data\\nand publicly available sources to evaluate and select the most effective risk\\nmitigation projects and optimize resource allocation across various disaster\\nscenarios. We apply this model to the state of Iowa, considering 16 hazards,\\nsix types of consequences, and 52 mitigation projects. Our results demonstrate\\nhow different budget levels influence project selection, emphasizing\\ncost-effective solutions that maximize risk reduction. Sensitivity analysis\\nexamines the robustness of project selection under varying effectiveness\\nassumptions and consequence estimations. The findings offer critical insights\\nfor policymakers in homeland security and emergency management and provide a\\nbasis for more efficient resource allocation and improved disaster resilience.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:49:15Z\"}"}
