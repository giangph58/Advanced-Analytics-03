However, the stochastic nature of their crystal grain formation\\nresults in strong spatial and temporal crystalline inhomogeneities. Here, we\\npropose the concept of spatially-controlled planar Czochralski growth, a novel\\nmethod for programming the quasi-monocrystalline growth of low-loss Sb2S3 PCM,\\nleveraging the seeded directional and progressive crystallization within\\nconfined channels. This guided crystallization method is experimentally shown\\nto circumvent the current limitations of conventional PCM-based nanophotonic\\ndevices, including a multilevel non-volatile optical phase-shifter exploiting a\\nsilicon nitride-based Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and a programmable\\nmetasurface with spectrally reconfigurable bound state in the continuum.\\nPrecisely controlling the growth of PCMs to ensure uniform crystalline\\nproperties across large areas is the cornerstone for the industrial development\\nof non-volatile reconfigurable photonic integrated circuits.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T10:32:43Z\"}"}
