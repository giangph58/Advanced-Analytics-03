{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05253v1\", \"title\": \"Gap-preserving reductions and RE-completeness of independent set games\", \"summary\": \"In complexity theory, gap-preserving reductions play a crucial role in\\nstudying hardness of approximation and in analyzing the relative complexity of\\nmultiprover interactive proof systems. In the quantum setting, multiprover\\ninteractive proof systems with entangled provers correspond to gapped promise\\nproblems for nonlocal games, and the recent result MIP$^*$=RE (Ji et al.,\\narXiv:2001.04383) shows that these are in general undecidable. However, the\\nrelative complexity of problems within MIP$^*$ is still not well-understood, as\\nestablishing gap-preserving reductions in the quantum setting presents new\\nchallenges. In this paper, we introduce a framework to study such reductions\\nand use it to establish MIP$^*$-completeness of the gapped promise problem for\\nthe natural class of independent set games. In such a game, the goal is to\\ndetermine whether a given graph contains an independent set of a specified\\nsize. We construct families of independent set games with constant question\\nsize for which the gapped promise problem is undecidable. In contrast, the same\\nproblem is decidable in polynomial time in the classical setting. To carry out\\nour reduction, we establish a new stability theorem, which could be of\\nindependent interest, allowing us to perturb families of almost PVMs to genuine\\nPVMs.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.CC,math.OA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:58:52Z\"}"}
