{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17522v1\", \"title\": \"Towards One-Stage End-to-End Table Structure Recognition with Parallel\\n  Regression for Diverse Scenarios\", \"summary\": \"Table structure recognition aims to parse tables in unstructured data into\\nmachine-understandable formats. Recent methods address this problem through a\\ntwo-stage process or optimized one-stage approaches. However, these methods\\neither require multiple networks to be serially trained and perform more\\ntime-consuming sequential decoding, or rely on complex post-processing\\nalgorithms to parse the logical structure of tables. They struggle to balance\\ncross-scenario adaptability, robustness, and computational efficiency. In this\\npaper, we propose a one-stage end-to-end table structure parsing network called\\nTableCenterNet. This network unifies the prediction of table spatial and\\nlogical structure into a parallel regression task for the first time, and\\nimplicitly learns the spatial-logical location mapping laws of cells through a\\nsynergistic architecture of shared feature extraction layers and task-specific\\ndecoding. Compared with two-stage methods, our method is easier to train and\\nfaster to infer. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that TableCenterNet can\\neffectively parse table structures in diverse scenarios and achieve\\nstate-of-the-art performance on the TableGraph-24k dataset.
