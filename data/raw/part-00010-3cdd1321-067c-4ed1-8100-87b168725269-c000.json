{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03406v1\", \"title\": \"Lightweight Clinical Decision Support System using QLoRA-Fine-Tuned LLMs\\n  and Retrieval-Augmented Generation\", \"summary\": \"This research paper investigates the application of Large Language Models\\n(LLMs) in healthcare, specifically focusing on enhancing medical decision\\nsupport through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrated with\\nhospital-specific data and fine-tuning using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation\\n(QLoRA). The system utilizes Llama 3.2-3B-Instruct as its foundation model. By\\nembedding and retrieving context-relevant healthcare information, the system\\nsignificantly improves response accuracy. QLoRA facilitates notable parameter\\nefficiency and memory optimization, preserving the integrity of medical\\ninformation through specialized quantization techniques. Our research also\\nshows that our model performs relatively well on various medical benchmarks,\\nindicating that it can be used to make basic medical suggestions. This paper\\ndetails the system's technical components, including its architecture,\\nquantization methods, and key healthcare applications such as enhanced disease\\nprediction from patient symptoms and medical history, treatment suggestions,\\nand efficient summarization of complex medical reports. We touch on the ethical\\nconsiderations-patient privacy, data security, and the need for rigorous\\nclinical validation-as well as the practical challenges of integrating such\\nsystems into real-world healthcare workflows. Furthermore, the lightweight\\nquantized weights ensure scalability and ease of deployment even in\\nlow-resource hospital environments. Finally, the paper concludes with an\\nanalysis of the broader impact of LLMs on healthcare and outlines future\\ndirections for LLMs in medical settings.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T10:31:54Z\"}"}
