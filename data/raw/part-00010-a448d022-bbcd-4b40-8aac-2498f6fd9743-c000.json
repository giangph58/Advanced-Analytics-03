In the present paper, a\\ngeneralisation of the classical models of Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko\\nbending beams based on the mentioned work is proposed. The former is still\\ncomposed of only one unidimensional scalar field, while the later introduces a\\nthird unidimensional scalar field, correcting the second order terms. The\\ngeneralised Euler-Bernoulli beam is then shown to exhibit curvature (i.e.\\ndisclinations) linked to a third order derivative of the displacement, but no\\ntorsion (dislocations). Parallelly, the generalised Timoshenko beam is shown to\\nexhibit both curvature and torsion, where the former is linked to the\\nnon-holonomy introduced in the generalisation. Lastly, using variational\\ncalculus, asymptotic values for the value taken by the curvature in static\\nequilibrium are obtained when the second order contribution becomes negligible;\\nalong with an equation for the torsion in the generalised Timoshenko beam.\", \"main_category\": \"math-ph\", \"categories\": \"math-ph,math.DG,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T07:57:13Z\"}"}
