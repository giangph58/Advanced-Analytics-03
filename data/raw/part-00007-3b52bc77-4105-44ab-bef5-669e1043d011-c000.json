Although these devices improve efficiency and promise\\nadditional comfort, they also introduce new security challenges. Common and\\neasy-to-explore vulnerabilities make IoT devices prime targets for malicious\\nactors.\\n  Upcoming mandatory security certifications offer a promising way to mitigate\\nthese risks by enforcing best practices and providing transparency. Regulatory\\nbodies are developing IoT security frameworks, but a universal standard for\\nlarge-scale systematic security assessment is lacking. Existing manual testing\\napproaches are expensive, limiting their efficacy in the diverse and rapidly\\nevolving IoT domain.\\n  This paper reviews current IoT security challenges and assessment efforts,\\nidentifies gaps, and proposes a roadmap for scalable, automated security\\nassessment, leveraging a model-based testing approach and machine learning\\ntechniques to strengthen consumer IoT security.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T09:15:04Z\"}"}
