Their computation involves matrix elements with a Wilson\\nline along a direction on the light cone, posing significant challenges in\\nEuclidean lattice calculations, where the time direction is not directly\\naccessible. We propose implementing the light-front Wilson line within the\\nHamiltonian formalism using tensor network techniques. The approach is\\ndemonstrated in the massive Schwinger model (quantum electrodynamics in 1+1\\ndimensions), a toy model that shares key features with quantum chromodynamics.\\nWe present accurate continuum results for the fermion PDF of the vector meson\\nat varying fermion masses, obtained from first principle calculations directly\\nin Minkowski space. Our strategy also provides a useful path for quantum\\nsimulations and quantum computing.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-lat\", \"categories\": \"hep-lat,hep-ph,hep-th,physics.comp-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T07:10:53Z\"}"}
