{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11241v1\", \"title\": \"Physics-Aware Initialization Refinement in Code-Aided EM for Blind\\n  Channel Estimation\", \"summary\": \"This paper addresses the well-known local maximum problem of the\\nexpectation-maximization (EM) algorithm in blind intersymbol interference (ISI)\\nchannel estimation. This problem primarily results from phase and shift\\nambiguity during initialization, which blind estimation is inherently unable to\\ndistinguish. We propose an effective initialization refinement algorithm that\\nutilizes the decoder output as a model selection metric, incorporating a\\ntechnique to detect phase and shift ambiguity. Our results show that the\\nproposed algorithm significantly reduces the number of local maximum cases to\\nnearly one-third for a 3-tap ISI channel under highly uncertain initial\\nconditions. The improvement becomes more pronounced as initial errors increase\\nand the channel memory grows. When used in a turbo equalizer, the proposed\\nalgorithm is required only in the first turbo iteration, which limits any\\ncomplexity increase with subsequent iterations.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:42:47Z\"}"}
