{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12257v1\", \"title\": \"QSHS: An Axion Dark Matter Resonant Search Apparatus\", \"summary\": \"We describe a resonant cavity search apparatus for axion dark matter\\nconstructed by the Quantum Sensors for the Hidden Sector (QSHS) collaboration.\\nThe apparatus is configured to search for QCD axion dark matter, though also\\nhas the capability to detect axion-like particles (ALPs), dark photons, and\\nsome other forms of wave-like dark matter. Initially, a tuneable cylindrical\\noxygen-free copper cavity is read out using a low noise microwave amplifier\\nfeeding a heterodyne receiver. The cavity is housed in a dilution refrigerator\\nand threaded by a solenoidal magnetic field, nominally 8T. The apparatus also\\nhouses a magnetic field shield for housing superconducting electronics, and\\nseveral other fixed-frequency resonators for use in testing and commissioning\\nvarious prototype quantum electronic devices sensitive at a range of axion\\nmasses in the range $\\\\rm 2.0$ to $\\\\rm 40\\\\,eV/c^2$. We present performance data\\nfor the resonator, dilution refrigerator, and magnet, and plans for the first\\nscience run.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det,astro-ph.IM,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T17:08:00Z\"}"}
