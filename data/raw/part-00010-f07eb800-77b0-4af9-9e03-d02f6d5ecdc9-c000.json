{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05134v1\", \"title\": \"Matrices over a Hilbert space and their low-rank approximation\", \"summary\": \"Matrices are typically considered over fields or rings. Motivated by\\napplications in parametric differential equations and data-driven modeling, we\\nsuggest to study matrices with entries from a Hilbert space and present an\\nelementary theory of them: from basic properties to low-rank approximation.\\nSpecifically, we extend the idea of cross approximation to such matrices and\\npropose an analogue of the adaptive cross approximation algorithm. Our\\nnumerical experiments show that this approach can achieve quasioptimal\\napproximation and be integrated with the existing computational software for\\npartial differential equations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T11:11:20Z\"}"}
