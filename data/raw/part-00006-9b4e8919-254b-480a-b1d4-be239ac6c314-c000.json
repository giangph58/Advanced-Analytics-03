We consider the NATT scheme and a recently\\nproposed Born machine adaptive tensor tree (BMATT) optimization scheme and\\ndemonstrate their effectiveness on a variety of generative modeling tasks where\\nthe objective is to infer the hidden structure of a provided dataset. Our\\nresults show that in terms of minimizing the negative log-likelihood, the\\nsingle-layer scheme has model performance comparable to the Born machine\\nscheme, though not better. The tasks include deducing the structure of binary\\nbitwise operations, learning the internal structure of random Bayesian networks\\ngiven only visible sites, and a real-world example related to hierarchical\\nclustering where a cladogram is constructed from mitochondrial DNA sequences.\\nIn doing so, we also show the importance of the choice of network topology and\\nthe versatility of a least-mutual information criterion in selecting a\\ncandidate structure for a tensor tree, as well as discuss aspects of these\\ntensor tree generative models including their information content and\\ninterpretability.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T09:23:11Z\"}"}
