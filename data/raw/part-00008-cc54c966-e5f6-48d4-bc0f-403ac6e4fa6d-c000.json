However, increasing disorder triggers a\\nquantum phase transition into a featureless normal insulator. As the underlying\\nquantum critical point is approached from the topological side, small scattered\\ndroplets of normal insulators start to develop in the system and their coherent\\nnucleation causes ultimate condensation of a trivial insulation. Unless\\ndisorder is too strong, the normal insulator accommodates disjoint tiny\\ntopological puddles. Furthermore, in the close vicinity of such a transition\\nthe emergent islands of topological and trivial insulators display spatial\\nfractal structures, a feature that is revealed only by local topological\\nmarkers. Here we showcase this (possibly) generic phenomenon that should be\\napposite to dirty topological crystals of any symmetry class in any dimension\\nfrom the Bott index and local Chern marker for a square lattice-based\\ndisordered Chern insulator model.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn,cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T17:59:35Z\"}"}
