{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20903v1\", \"title\": \"Modeling AI-Human Collaboration as a Multi-Agent Adaptation\", \"summary\": \"We develop an agent-based simulation to formalize AI-human collaboration as a\\nfunction of task structure, advancing a generalizable framework for strategic\\ndecision-making in organizations. Distinguishing between heuristic-based human\\nadaptation and rule-based AI search, we model interactions across modular\\n(parallel) and sequenced (interdependent) tasks using an NK model. Our results\\nreveal that in modular tasks, AI often substitutes for humans - delivering\\nhigher payoffs unless human expertise is very high, and the AI search space is\\neither narrowly focused or extremely broad. In sequenced tasks, interesting\\ncomplementarities emerge. When an expert human initiates the search and AI\\nsubsequently refines it, aggregate performance is maximized. Conversely, when\\nAI leads, excessive heuristic refinement by the human can reduce payoffs. We\\nalso show that even \\\"hallucinatory\\\" AI - lacking memory or structure - can\\nimprove outcomes when augmenting low-capability humans by helping escape local\\noptima. These results yield a robust implication: the effectiveness of AI-human\\ncollaboration depends less on context or industry, and more on the underlying\\ntask structure. By elevating task decomposition as the central unit of\\nanalysis, our model provides a transferable lens for strategic decision-making\\ninvolving humans and an agentic AI across diverse organizational settings.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MA\", \"categories\": \"cs.MA,cs.AI,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T16:19:53Z\"}"}
