Wombling is used widely to\\ntrack regions of rapid change within the spatial reference domain. Specific\\nfunctions in the package implement Gaussian process models for point-referenced\\nspatial data followed by predictive inference on rates of change over curves\\nusing line integrals. We demonstrate model based Bayesian inference using\\nposterior distributions featuring simple analytic forms while offering\\nuncertainty quantification over curves.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.CO\", \"categories\": \"stat.CO,stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T11:50:41Z\"}"}
