That empirical fit convinces us that a mean-reversion process\\nwith only one time scale is enough to model, in a pretty precise way, the\\nreality of the trend-following mechanism at the average scale of CTAs and as a\\nconsequence, using only one simple EMA, appears optimal to capture the trend.\\nAs a consequence, using a complex basket of different complex indicators as\\nsignal, do not seem to be so rational or optimal and exposes to the risk of\\ncherry-picking.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.PM\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.PM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T06:51:27Z\"}"}
