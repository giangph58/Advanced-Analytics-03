This formulation enables simultaneous optimization\\nof network parameters and state trajectories, addressing key limitations of ODE\\nsolver-based training in terms of stability, runtime, and accuracy. Extending\\non a recent direct collocation-based method for Neural ODEs, we generalize to\\nPeNODEs, incorporate physical constraints, and present a custom, parallelized,\\nopen-source implementation. Benchmarks on a Quarter Vehicle Model and a\\nVan-der-Pol oscillator demonstrate superior accuracy, speed, and generalization\\nwith smaller networks compared to other training techniques. We also outline a\\nplanned integration into OpenModelica to enable accessible training of Neural\\nDAEs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,math.DS,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T14:04:46Z\"}"}
