{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16535v1\", \"title\": \"Decentralized Quantile Regression for Feature-Distributed Massive\\n  Datasets with Privacy Guarantees\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we introduce a novel decentralized surrogate gradient-based\\nalgorithm for quantile regression in a feature-distributed setting, where\\nglobal features are dispersed across multiple machines within a decentralized\\nnetwork. The proposed algorithm, \\\\texttt{DSG-cqr}, utilizes a convolution-type\\nsmoothing approach to address the non-smooth nature of the quantile loss\\nfunction. \\\\texttt{DSG-cqr} is fully decentralized, conjugate-free, easy to\\nimplement, and achieves linear convergence up to statistical precision. To\\nensure privacy, we adopt the Gaussian mechanism to provide\\n$(\\\\epsilon,\\\\delta)$-differential privacy. To overcome the exact residual\\ncalculation problem, we estimate residuals using auxiliary variables and\\ndevelop a confidence interval construction method based on Wald statistics.\\nTheoretical properties are established, and the practical utility of the\\nmethods is also demonstrated through extensive simulations and a real-world\\ndata application.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.CO\", \"categories\": \"stat.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T09:04:21Z\"}"}
