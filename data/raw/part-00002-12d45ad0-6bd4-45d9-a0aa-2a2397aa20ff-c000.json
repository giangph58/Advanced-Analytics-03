To this end, we introduce two classes\\nof Lipschitz spaces for $1\\\\le p\\\\le \\\\infty$: $\\\\Lambda_{\\\\theta}^p$, defined via\\nthe associated Markov semigroup, and $\\\\mathrm L_{\\\\theta}^p$, defined via the\\nintrinsic distance. In the strong sense, we prove a priori Sobolev regularity\\nand Lipschitz regularity in the class of $\\\\Lambda_{\\\\theta}^p$ space. In the\\ndistributional sense, we further show local regularity in the class of $\\\\mathrm\\nL_{\\\\theta}^{\\\\infty}$ space. These results require some strong assumptions on\\n$-L$. Our main techniques build on the differentiability of the associated\\nsemigroup, explicit dimension-free $L^p$ ($1<p<\\\\infty$) boundedness of first\\nand second order Riesz transforms, and a comparison between the two Lipschitz\\nnorms.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math.FA,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T09:04:50Z\"}"}
