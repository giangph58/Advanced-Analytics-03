{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05301v1\", \"title\": \"Operator-Level Quantum Acceleration of Non-Logconcave Sampling\", \"summary\": \"Sampling from probability distributions of the form $\\\\sigma \\\\propto e^{-\\\\beta\\nV}$, where $V$ is a continuous potential, is a fundamental task across physics,\\nchemistry, biology, computer science, and statistics. However, when $V$ is\\nnon-convex, the resulting distribution becomes non-logconcave, and classical\\nmethods such as Langevin dynamics often exhibit poor performance. We introduce\\nthe first quantum algorithm that provably accelerates a broad class of\\ncontinuous-time sampling dynamics. For Langevin dynamics, our method encodes\\nthe target Gibbs measure into the amplitudes of a quantum state, identified as\\nthe kernel of a block matrix derived from a factorization of the Witten\\nLaplacian operator. This connection enables Gibbs sampling via singular value\\nthresholding and yields the first provable quantum advantage with respect to\\nthe Poincar\\\\'e constant in the non-logconcave setting. Building on this\\nframework, we further develop the first quantum algorithm that accelerates\\nreplica exchange Langevin diffusion, a widely used method for sampling from\\ncomplex, rugged energy landscapes.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.LG,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:43:17Z\"}"}
