Similarly to the case of\\ncoherent states, this relative entropy is proportional to the smeared\\nPauli-Jordan distribution. Consequently, the Araki-Uhlmann entropy between a\\nsqueezed state and the vacuum satisfies all expected properties: it remains\\npositive, increases with the size of the Minkowski region under consideration,\\nand decreases as the mass parameter grows.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:55:00Z\"}"}
