{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13018v1\", \"title\": \"High Dimensional Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis for Elliptical\\n  Symmetric Distributions\", \"summary\": \"This paper proposes a robust high-dimensional sparse canonical correlation\\nanalysis (CCA) method for investigating linear relationships between two\\nhigh-dimensional random vectors, focusing on elliptical symmetric\\ndistributions. Traditional CCA methods, based on sample covariance matrices,\\nstruggle in high-dimensional settings, particularly when data exhibit\\nheavy-tailed distributions. To address this, we introduce the spatial-sign\\ncovariance matrix as a robust estimator, combined with a sparsity-inducing\\npenalty to efficiently estimate canonical correlations. Theoretical analysis\\nshows that our method is consistent and robust under mild conditions,\\nconverging at an optimal rate even in the presence of heavy tails. Simulation\\nstudies demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing sparse CCA methods,\\nparticularly under heavy-tailed distributions. A real-world application further\\nconfirms the method's robustness and efficiency in practice. Our work provides\\na novel solution for high-dimensional canonical correlation analysis, offering\\nsignificant advantages over traditional methods in terms of both stability and\\nperformance.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T15:25:51Z\"}"}
