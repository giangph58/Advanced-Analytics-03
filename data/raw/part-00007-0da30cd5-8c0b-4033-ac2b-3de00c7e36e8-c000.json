In this work, we perform\\nan analysis of this reaction using an effective Lagrangian approach for the\\nfirst time, incorporating the well-established $\\\\Sigma(1189) 1/2^+$,\\n$\\\\Sigma(1385) 3/2^+$, $\\\\Sigma(1670) 3/2^-$, $\\\\Sigma(1775) 5/2^-$ states, while\\nalso exploring contributions from other unestablished states.\\n  By fitting the available differential cross section and recoil polarization\\ndata, adhering to partial-wave phase conventions same as PDG, we find that\\nbesides the established resonances, contributions from $\\\\Sigma(1660) 1/2^+$,\\n$\\\\Sigma(1580) 3/2^-$ and a $\\\\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$ improve the description.\\n  Notably, a $\\\\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$ resonance with mass around 1.54 GeV, consistent\\nwith $\\\\Sigma(1620)1/2^-$, is found to be essential for describing the data in\\nthis channel, a stronger indication than found in previous analyses focusing on\\n$\\\\pi\\\\Lambda$ final states.\\n  While providing complementary support for $\\\\Sigma(1660) 1/2^+$ and\\n$\\\\Sigma(1580) 3/2^-$, our results highlight the importance of the $\\\\Sigma(1620)\\n1/2^-$ region in $K_Lp \\\\to \\\\pi^+\\\\Sigma^0$. Future high-precision measurements\\nare needed to solidify these findings and further constrain the $\\\\Sigma^*$\\nspectrum.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T06:04:55Z\"}"}
