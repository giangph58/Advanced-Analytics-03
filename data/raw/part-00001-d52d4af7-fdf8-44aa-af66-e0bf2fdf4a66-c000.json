{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23981v1\", \"title\": \"Federated Structured Sparse PCA for Anomaly Detection in IoT Networks\", \"summary\": \"Although federated learning has gained prominence as a privacy-preserving\\nframework tailored for distributed Internet of Things (IoT) environments,\\ncurrent federated principal component analysis (PCA) methods lack integration\\nof sparsity, a critical feature for robust anomaly detection. To address this\\nlimitation, we propose a novel federated structured sparse PCA (FedSSP)\\napproach for anomaly detection in IoT networks. The proposed model uniquely\\nintegrates double sparsity regularization: (1) row-wise sparsity governed by\\n$\\\\ell_{2,p}$-norm with $p\\\\in[0,1)$ to eliminate redundant feature dimensions,\\nand (2) element-wise sparsity via $\\\\ell_{q}$-norm with $q\\\\in[0,1)$ to suppress\\nnoise-sensitive components. To efficiently solve this non-convex optimization\\nproblem in a distributed setting, we devise a proximal alternating minimization\\n(PAM) algorithm with rigorous theoretical proofs establishing its convergence\\nguarantees. Experiments on real datasets validate that incorporating structured\\nsparsity enhances both model interpretability and detection accuracy.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T11:50:21Z\"}"}
