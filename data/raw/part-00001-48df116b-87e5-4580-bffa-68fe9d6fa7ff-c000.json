Recent advancements in\\nmachine learning have enabled automated diagnostic tools that assist\\nradiologists in making more reliable and efficient decisions. In this work, we\\npropose a Singular Value Decomposition-based Least Squares (SVD-LS) framework\\nfor multi-class pneumonia classification, leveraging powerful feature\\nrepresentations from state-of-the-art self-supervised and transfer learning\\nmodels. Rather than relying on computationally expensive gradient based\\nfine-tuning, we employ a closed-form, non-iterative classification approach\\nthat ensures efficiency without compromising accuracy. Experimental results\\ndemonstrate that SVD-LS achieves competitive performance while offering\\nsignificantly reduced computational costs, making it a viable alternative for\\nreal-time medical imaging applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:39:16Z\"}"}
