In general, a coherent\\nmatching field induces a monomial order to Pl\\\\\\\"{u}cker algebra, and block\\ndiagonal matching fields are a kind of coherent matching fields. In the present\\npaper, we introduce a new kind of block diagonal matching fields and study the\\nproblem when they give a SAGBI basis. As a corollary, we provide a new family\\nof toric degenerations of Grassmannians by using SAGBI bases.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,math.AC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T08:23:48Z\"}"}
