{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16675v1\", \"title\": \"A Novel Sparse Sum and Difference Co-Array With Low Redundancy and\\n  Enhanced DOF for Non-Circular Signals\", \"summary\": \"Array structures based on the sum and difference co-arrays provide more\\ndegrees of freedom (DOF). However, since the growth of DOF is limited by a\\nsingle case of sum and difference co-arrays, the paper aims to design a sparse\\nlinear array (SLA) with higher DOF via exploring different cases of\\nsecond-order cumulants. We present a mathematical framework based on\\nsecond-order cumulant to devise a second-order extended co-array (SO-ECA) and\\ndefine the redundancy of SO-ECA. Based on SO-ECA, a novel array is proposed,\\nnamely low redundancy sum and difference array (LR-SDA), which can provide\\nclosed-form expressions for the sensor positions and enhance DOF in order to\\nresolve more signal sources in the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation of\\nnon-circular (NC) signals. For LR-SDA, the maximum DOF under the given number\\nof total physical sensors can be derived and the SO-ECA of LR-SDA is hole-free.\\nFurther, the corresponding necessary and sufficient conditions of signal\\nreconstruction for LR-SDA are derived. Additionally, the redundancy and weight\\nfunction of LR-SDA are defined, and the lower band of the redundancy for LR-SDA\\nis derived. The proposed LR-SDA achieves higher DOF and lower redundancy than\\nthose of existing DCAs designed based on sum and difference co-arrays.\\nNumerical simulations are conducted to verify the superiority of LR-SDA on DOA\\nestimation performance and enhanced DOF over other existing DCAs.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T12:45:06Z\"}"}
