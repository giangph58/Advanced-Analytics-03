Krylov state\\ncomplexity quantifies the spread of quantum states within the Krylov basis and\\nserves as a powerful diagnostic for analyzing nonergodic dynamics. In this\\nwork, we study spin-one XXZ magnets and reveal nonergodic behavior tied to\\nQMBS. For the XY model, the nematic N\\\\'eel state exhibits periodic revivals in\\nKrylov complexity. In the generic XXZ model, we identify spin helix states as\\nweakly ergodicity-breaking states, characterized by low entanglement and\\nnonthermal dynamics. Across different scenarios, the Lanczos coefficients for\\nscarred states display an elliptical pattern, reflecting a hidden SU(2) algebra\\nthat enables analytical results for Krylov complexity and fidelity. These\\nfindings, which exemplify the rare capability to characterize QMBS\\nanalytically, are feasible with current experimental techniques and offer deep\\ninsights into the nonergodic dynamics of interacting quantum systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:29:45Z\"}"}
