Consequently, this decay is highly\\nsuppressed, making it a promising avenue for probing potential new physics.\\nWhile phenomenological calculations have made important progress in predicting\\nthe decay amplitude, there remains a four-fold ambiguity in the relevant\\ntransition form factors that prevents a unique prediction for the branching\\nfraction and angular observables. Fully resolving this ambiguity requires a\\nfirst-principles Standard-Model calculation, and the recent observation of this\\nprocess using LHCb Run 2 data reinforces the timeliness of such a calculation.\\nIn this work, we present the first lattice-QCD calculation of this decay,\\nperformed using a 2+1-flavour domain-wall fermion ensemble with a pion mass of\\n340 MeV. At a small baryon source-sink separation, we observe the emergence of\\na signal in the relevant baryonic four-point functions. This allows us to\\ndetermine the positive-parity form factors for the rare hyperon decays from\\nfirst-principles, albeit with large statistical and systematic uncertainties.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-lat\", \"categories\": \"hep-lat,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T13:20:40Z\"}"}
