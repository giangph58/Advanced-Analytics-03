However, most attack models require the\\nknowledge of the target details, which is difficult to be implemented in real\\nsystems. Our objective is to develop an attack model with no requirement for\\nthe target information, while enhancing the block error rate. In our design, we\\npropose a novel Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) based attack\\narchitecture, which exploits the property of deep learning models being\\nvulnerable to perturbations induced by dynamically changing channel conditions.\\nIn the proposed generator, the attack network is composed of convolution layer,\\nconvolution transpose layer and linear layer. Then we present the training\\nstrategy and the details of the training algorithm. Subsequently, we propose\\nthe validation strategy to evaluate the performance of the generator.\\nSimulations are conducted and the results show that our proposed adversarial\\nattack generator achieve better block error rate attack performance than that\\nof benchmark schemes over Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel,\\nRayleigh channel and High-Speed Railway channel.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T08:31:54Z\"}"}
