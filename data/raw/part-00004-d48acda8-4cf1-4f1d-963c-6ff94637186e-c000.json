Here, we present a non-invasive imaging approach that harnesses the\\nnonlinear response of luminescent labels in conjunction with the statistical\\nand spatial properties of speckle patterns - an effect of random light\\ninterference. Using avalanching nanoparticles (ANPs) with strong\\nphotoluminescence nonlinearity, we demonstrate that random speckle illumination\\ncan be converted into a single, localized, sub-diffraction excitation spot.\\nThis spot can be scanned across the sample using the angular memory effect,\\nenabling high-resolution imaging through a scattering layer. Our method is\\ngeneral, fast, and cost-effective. It requires no wavefront shaping, no\\nfeedback, and no reconstruction algorithm, offering a powerful new route to\\ndeep, high-resolution imaging through complex media.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.bio-ph,physics.med-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:10:24Z\"}"}
