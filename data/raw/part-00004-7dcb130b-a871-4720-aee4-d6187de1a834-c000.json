Emerging evidence\\nsuggests these genetic variations may also influence respiratory function and\\nvitality. However, the specific impact of different ApoE genotypes on breathing\\npatterns remains largely unexplored. This work investigates differences in\\nbreathing waveform characteristics and entropy statistics derived from\\nplethysmography (PLETH) data between rat models possessing two distinct ApoE\\ngenotypes (referred to herein as gene59 and gene95). Findings reveal\\nsignificant distributional differences in common plethysmography metrics and\\napproximate entropy between the two genotypes, observed during both active and\\nresting states. Additionally, the study examines the transient impact of sighs\\n(deep breaths) on these breathing metrics, demonstrating that entropy and other\\nmeasures are altered in the breaths immediately following a sigh.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T16:20:32Z\"}"}
