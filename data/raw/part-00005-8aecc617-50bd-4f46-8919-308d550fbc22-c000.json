To this end, numerical simulations are carried out using a two-stage\\nnumerical approach: the first stage simulates the gas-liquid flow along with\\nthe heat and vapor distribution, while the second stage models the particle\\nbehavior using Lagrangian particle tracking. The results reveal that for an\\nethanol droplet evaporating with a constant contact angle in the absence of\\nthermocapillary Marangoni stresses, the flow induced by the receding motion of\\nthe contact line supersedes the capillary flow, moving the fluid from the\\ncontact line to the apex of the droplet. This flow moves the particles from the\\nbulk of the droplet to the apex of the droplet and suppresses size-based\\nself-sorting of the particles. However, in the presence of Marangoni stresses,\\na flow along the interface near the apex of the droplet promotes the\\nself-sorting of particles based on their size, whereby smaller particles\\nconcentrate near the droplet apex and larger particles form an outer shell\\naround them.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T10:25:38Z\"}"}
