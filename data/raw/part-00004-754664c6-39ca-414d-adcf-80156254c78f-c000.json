{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11254v1\", \"title\": \"Model Consistency of Iterative Regularization for Low-Complexity\\n  Regularization\", \"summary\": \"Regularization is a core component of modern inverse problems as it allows to\\nestablish well-posedness to the solution of interests. Popular regularization\\napproaches include variational regularization and iterative regularization. The\\nformer one can be tackled by solving a variational optimization problem, which\\nis the sum of a regularization term and a data-fidelity term balanced by a\\nproper weight, while the latter one chooses a proper stopping time to avoid\\noverfitting to the noise. In the study of regularization, an important topic is\\nthe relation between the solution obtained by regularization and the original\\nground truth. When the ground truth has low-complexity structure which is\\nencoded as the \\\"model\\\", a sensitivity property shows that the solution obtained\\nfrom proper regularization that promotes the same structure is robust to small\\nperturbations, this is called \\\"model consistency\\\". For variational\\nregularization, model consistency of linear inverse problem is studied in [1].\\nWhile, for iterative regularization, the existence of model consistency is an\\nopen problem. In this paper, based on a recent development of partial\\nsmoothness which is also considered in [1], we show that if the noise level is\\nsufficiently small and a proper stopping time is chosen, the solution by\\niterative regularization also achieves model consistency and more exhibit local\\nlinear convergence behavior. Numerical simulations are provided to verify our\\ntheoretical findings.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:51:11Z\"}"}
