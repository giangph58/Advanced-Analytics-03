By solving numerically the\\ntwo-electron time-dependent Schr\\\\\\\"odinger equation we demonstrate that while\\nfor electromagnetic pulses of a few tens of femtoseconds duration and longer\\nthe sequential single-electron approximation perfectly describes the ionization\\ndynamics, for pulses as short as a few femtoseconds this picture breaks down\\nentirely, and the electron-electron interaction suppresses the rate of\\nionization by approximately one order of magnitude. We also show weak but clear\\nsignatures of the collective tunneling effect in the photoelectron density\\ndistribution.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T09:37:27Z\"}"}
