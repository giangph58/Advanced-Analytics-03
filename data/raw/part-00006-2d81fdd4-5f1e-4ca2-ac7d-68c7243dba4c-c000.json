By virtue of the Mostow decomposition theorem,\\n$T^*\\\\mathbb{CP}(1)$ is isomorphic, as $SU(2)$-equivariant fiber bundle over\\n$\\\\mathbb{CP}(1)$, to a complex (co-)adjoint orbit of $SL(2, \\\\mathbb{C})$. In\\nfact, this complex (co-)adjoint orbit is fibered over $\\\\mathbb{CP}(1)\\\\simeq\\n\\\\mathbb{S}^2$ with each fiber isomorphic to the hyperbolic disc $\\\\mathbb{H}^2$.\\nIn this paper, we are interested in the complex structure inherited on the\\nhyperbolic disc $\\\\mathbb{H}^2$ by the hyperk\\\\\\\"ahler extension of the\\n$2$-sphere. Contrary to what is generally believed, we show that it differs\\nfrom the natural complex structure of $\\\\mathbb{H}^2\\\\subset \\\\mathbb{C}$\\ninherited from its embedding in $\\\\mathbb{C}$. In other words, the embedding of\\n$\\\\mathbb{H}^2$ with its Hermitian-symmetric structure into the hyperk\\\\\\\"ahler\\nmanifold $T^*\\\\mathbb{CP}(1)$ is not holomorphic.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG,math.CV,math.SG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:18:08Z\"}"}
