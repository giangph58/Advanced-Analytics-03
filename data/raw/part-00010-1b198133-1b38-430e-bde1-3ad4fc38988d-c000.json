We introduce a\\ngeneral ansatz based on decorated trees for the solution of the flow equation.\\nThe ansatz is renormalised in a recursive way, in the sense of the trees, via\\nlocal extractions introduced for regularity structures. We derive the\\nrenormalised equation from this ansatz and show that the renormalisation scheme\\nis identical to that appearing in the context of regularity structures, thus\\nmatching the BPHZ renormalisation.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,math-ph,math.AP,math.MP,math.RA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T09:52:25Z\"}"}
