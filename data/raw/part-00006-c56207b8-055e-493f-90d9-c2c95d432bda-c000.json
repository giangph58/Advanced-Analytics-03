It produces the exact\\nasymptotics of the relative prediction error and the partial correlation\\ncoefficients. The assumptions are analytic in nature and applicable to\\nprocesses with long range dependence. The ARIMA type process driven by the\\nfractional Gaussian noise (fGn), which previously remained elusive, serves as\\nour study case.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,math.PR,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T10:03:53Z\"}"}
