This\\ncombination allows an efficient dissemination of messages in unstructured\\npeer-to-peer (P2P) networks. However, GossipSub needs to consider message size,\\nwhich is crucial for the efficient operation of many applications, such as\\nhandling large Ethereum blocks. This paper proposes modifications to improve\\nGossipSub's performance when transmitting large messages. We evaluate the\\nproposed improvements using the shadow simulator. Our results show that the\\nproposed improvements significantly enhance GossipSub's performance for large\\nmessage transmissions in sizeable networks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:10:41Z\"}"}
