For a prime $r \\\\in \\\\pi(G)$, we define $r$-singular\\nelements as those elements of $G$ whose order is divisible by $r$. Denote by\\n$S_r(G)$ the number of $r$-singluar elements of $G$. We denote the proportion\\n$S_r(G)/|G|$ of $r$-singular elements in $G$ by ${\\\\mu_r}(G)$. Let $\\\\mu(G) :=\\n{\\\\{\\\\mu_r}(G) | r\\\\in \\\\pi(G)\\\\}$ be the set of all proportions of $r$-singular\\nelements for each prime $r$ in $\\\\pi(G)$. In this paper, we prove that if a\\nfinite group $G$ has the same set $\\\\mu(G)$ as the simple group $\\\\PSL(2,q)$,\\nthen $G$ is isomorphic to $\\\\PSL(2,q)$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GR\", \"categories\": \"math.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:30:34Z\"}"}
