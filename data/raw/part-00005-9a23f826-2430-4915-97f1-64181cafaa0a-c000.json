The effect of gene deletion on social\\nbehaviors in mice is controversial between studies using different Neo+ and\\nNeo-mouse lines, particularly Arc/Arg3.1 KO lines. In this study, we identified\\nsevere maternal behavior impairments in Neo+, but not Neo-Arc/Arg3.1 KO dams.\\nThese deficits resulted from reduced sociability and abnormal social\\ninformation processing in Neo+ Arc/Arg3.1 KO dams, exacerbated by social\\ncommunication impairments in pups. The expression of the Neo cassette product\\ndid not cause cytotoxicity, but led to altered ERK signaling, gene expression,\\nand oxytocin system. However, oxytocin administration did not improve social\\nimpairments in Neo+ Arc/Arg3.1 KO animals. Interestingly, early social\\nenvironment enrichment enhanced social interaction with familiar, but not\\nunfamiliar conspecifics or maternal behavior. Overall, our findings reveal a\\nmajor impact of the Neo cassette on behaviors, particularly social behaviors,\\nin Arc/Arg3.1 KO mice, underscoring the need to re-examine phenotypes of animal\\nmodels carrying the Neo cassette in neuroscience research.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.NC\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.NC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T09:10:30Z\"}"}
