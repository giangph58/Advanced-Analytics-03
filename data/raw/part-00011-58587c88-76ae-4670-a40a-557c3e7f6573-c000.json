We prove that this system is integrable only in two\\ncases analogous to the Euler and Lagrange cases of the classical top problem.\\nThe cases with the constant gravity field with acceleration $g\\\\neq0$ and\\nwithout external field $g=0$ are considered. The non-integrability proof for\\n$g\\\\neq0$ based on the fact that the equations of motion for the sliding top are\\na perturbation of the classical top equations of motion. We show that the\\nintegrability of the classical top is a necessary condition for the\\nintegrability of the sliding top. Among four integrable classical top cases the\\ncorresponding two cases for the sliding top are also integrable, and for the\\ntwo remaining cases, we prove their non-integrability by analyzing the\\ndifferential Galois group of variational equations along a certain particular\\nsolution. In the absence of constant gravitational field $g=0$ the\\nintegrability is much more difficult. At first, we proved that if the sliding\\ntop problem is integrable, then the body is symmetric. In the proof, we applied\\none of the Ziglin theorem concerning the splitting of separatrices phenomenon.\\nThen we prove the non-integrability of the symmetric sliding top using\\ndifferential Galois group of variational equations except two the same as for\\n$g\\\\neq0$ cases. The integrability of these cases is also preserved when we add\\nto equations of motion a gyrostatic term.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.CD\", \"categories\": \"nlin.CD,nlin.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T06:36:16Z\"}"}
