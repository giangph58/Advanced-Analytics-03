The classification and\\ncharacterization of finite bicyclic groups have long been important problems in\\ngroup theory, with applications extending to symmetric embeddings of the\\ncomplete bipartite graphs. A classical result by Douglas establishes that every\\nbicyclic group is supersolvable. More recently, Fan and Li (2018) proved that\\nevery finite $(m,n)$-bicyclic group is abelian if and only if\\n$\\\\gcd(m,\\\\phi(n))=\\\\gcd(n,\\\\phi(m))=1$, where $\\\\phi$ is Euler's totient function.\\nIn this paper we generalize this result further and show that every\\n$(m,n)$-bicyclic group is nilpotent if and only if\\n$\\\\gcd(n,\\\\phi(\\\\mathrm{rad}(m)))=\\\\gcd(m,\\\\phi(\\\\mathrm{rad}(n)))=1$, where\\n  $\\\\mathrm{rad}(m)$ denotes the radical of $m$ (the product of its distinct\\nprime divisors).\", \"main_category\": \"math.GR\", \"categories\": \"math.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T08:56:57Z\"}"}
