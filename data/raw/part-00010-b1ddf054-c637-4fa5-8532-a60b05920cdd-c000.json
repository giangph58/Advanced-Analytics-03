The approach consists of two primary steps: (i) Bayesian calibration\\nof the discrepancy between high- and low-fidelity models, and (ii) propagating\\nthe model discrepancy uncertainty through the optimization problem. When\\nhigh-fidelity model evaluations are limited, as is common in practice, the\\nprior discrepancy distribution plays a crucial role in the uncertainty\\nanalysis. However, specification of this prior is challenging due to its\\nmathematical complexity and many hyper-parameters. This article presents a\\nnovel approach to specify the prior distribution. Our approach consists of two\\nparts: (1) an algorithmic initialization of the prior hyper-parameters that\\nuses existing data to initialize a hyper-parameter estimate, and (2) a\\nvisualization framework to systematically explore properties of the prior and\\nguide tuning of the hyper-parameters to ensure that the prior captures the\\nappropriate range of uncertainty. We provide detailed mathematical analysis and\\na collection of numerical examples that elucidate properties of the prior that\\nare crucial to ensure uncertainty quantification.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:09:37Z\"}"}
