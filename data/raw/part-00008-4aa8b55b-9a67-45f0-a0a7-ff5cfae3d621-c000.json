{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15037v1\", \"title\": \"A Call for New Recipes to Enhance Spatial Reasoning in MLLMs\", \"summary\": \"Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive\\nperformance in general vision-language tasks. However, recent studies have\\nexposed critical limitations in their spatial reasoning capabilities. This\\ndeficiency in spatial reasoning significantly constrains MLLMs' ability to\\ninteract effectively with the physical world, thereby limiting their broader\\napplications. We argue that spatial reasoning capabilities will not naturally\\nemerge from merely scaling existing architectures and training methodologies.\\nInstead, this challenge demands dedicated attention to fundamental\\nmodifications in the current MLLM development approach. In this position paper,\\nwe first establish a comprehensive framework for spatial reasoning within the\\ncontext of MLLMs. We then elaborate on its pivotal role in real-world\\napplications. Through systematic analysis, we examine how individual components\\nof the current methodology-from training data to reasoning mechanisms-influence\\nspatial reasoning capabilities. This examination reveals critical limitations\\nwhile simultaneously identifying promising avenues for advancement. Our work\\naims to direct the AI research community's attention toward these crucial yet\\nunderexplored aspects. By highlighting these challenges and opportunities, we\\nseek to catalyze progress toward achieving human-like spatial reasoning\\ncapabilities in MLLMs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T11:48:39Z\"}"}
