In the process,\\nwe establish a version of the Beilinson fibre square of\\nAntieau--Mathew--Morrow--Nikolaus with coefficients in the proper case and\\nprove a comparison between syntomic cohomology and $p$-adic \\\\'etale cohomology\\nwith coefficients in an arbitrary $F$-gauge. Our methods also yield a\\ndescription of the isogeny category of perfect $F$-gauges on $\\\\mathbb{Z}_p$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG,math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:26:54Z\"}"}
