We\\nprove some canonical embeddings from the (path) independence complexes of the\\nunderlying graphs to the (path) independence complexes of the digraphs as well\\nas some canonical embeddings between the (path) independence complexes induced\\nby strong totally geodesic immersions of (di)graphs. We apply the path\\ncomplexes and the path homology to the path independence complexes of\\n(di)graphs. As by-products, we give some consequences about the Shannon\\ncapacities.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T14:22:32Z\"}"}
