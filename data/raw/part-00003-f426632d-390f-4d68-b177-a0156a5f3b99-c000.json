Using the MESA\\nIsochrones and Stellar Tracks (MIST) with Gaia EDR3 data, we determined the\\nfollowing parameters for NGC 6416: a distance of approximately 1021pc, an age\\nof about $12.58\\\\pm 0.1$ Myr, a metallicity (z) of roughly $0.032\\\\pm0.0015$, a\\nbinarity fraction near $0.419\\\\pm0.021$, and an extinction ($A_V$) of\\napproximately $0.995\\\\pm0.058$ mag for an $R_V$ value of around $3.064\\\\pm0.102$.\\nWe also fitted the radial surface density profile and conducted orbit analysis\\nof the cluster using galpy. And finally found that the star formation scenarios\\nare not observed in the open star cluster NGC 6416.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T16:25:56Z\"}"}
