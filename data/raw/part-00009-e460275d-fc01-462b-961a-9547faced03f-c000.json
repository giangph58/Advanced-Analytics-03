In dimension $N =\\n2$, we are able to make the extra term completely explicit, thus providing a\\nnew Bonnesen-type inequality for the Poincar\\\\'e constant in terms of diameter\\nand inradius. Such estimate is sharp, and it is asymptotically attained when\\nthe domain is the intersection of a ball with a strip bounded by parallel\\nstraight lines, symmetric about the centre of the ball. As a key intermediate\\nstep, we prove that the ball maximizes the Poincar\\\\'e constant in $W ^ {1, 1}\\n(\\\\Omega)$, among convex bodies $\\\\Omega$ of given constant width.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:00:04Z\"}"}
