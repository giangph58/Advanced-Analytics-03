We introduce a novel approach to visualizing and\\nstudying invariant manifolds by using 3D printing technology, combining\\nadvanced computational techniques with modern 3D printing processes to\\ntransform mathematical abstractions into tangible models. Our work addresses\\nthe challenges of translating complex manifolds into printable meshes,\\nshowcasing results for the following systems of differential equations: the\\nLorenz system, the Arneodo-Coullet-Tresser system, and the Langford system. By\\nbridging abstract mathematics and physical reality, this approach promises new\\ntools for research and education in nonlinear dynamics. We conclude with\\npractical guidelines for reproducing and extending our results, emphasizing the\\npotential of 3D-printed manifolds to enhance understanding and exploration in\\ndynamical systems theory.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T13:28:55Z\"}"}
