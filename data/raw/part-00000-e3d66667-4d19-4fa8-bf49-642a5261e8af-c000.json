{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24117v1\", \"title\": \"Organizations, teams, and job mobility: A social microdynamics approach\", \"summary\": \"The internal structures of large organizations determine much of what occurs\\ninside including the way in which tasks are performed, the workers that perform\\nthem, and the mobility of those workers within the organization. However,\\nregarding this latter process, most of the theoretical and modeling approaches\\nused to understand organizational worker mobility are highly stylized, using\\nidealizations such as structureless organizations, indistinguishable workers,\\nand a lack of social bonding of the workers. In this article, aided by a decade\\nof precise, temporally resolved data of a large US government organization, we\\nintroduce a new model to describe organizations as composites of teams within\\nwhich individuals perform specific tasks and where social connections develop.\\nBy tracking the personnel composition of organizational teams, we find that\\nworkers that change jobs are highly influenced by preferring to reunite with\\npast co-workers. In this organization, 34\\\\% of all moves lead to worker\\nreunions, a percentage well-above expectation. We find that the greater the\\ntime workers spend together or the smaller the team they share both increase\\ntheir likelihood to reunite, supporting the notion of increased familiarity and\\ntrust behind such reunions and the dominant role of social capital in the\\nevolution of large organizations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CE\", \"categories\": \"cs.CE\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:07:28Z\"}"}
