{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15660v1\", \"title\": \"Electroweak form factors of baryons in dense nuclear matter\", \"summary\": \"There are evidences that the properties of the hadrons are modified in a\\nnuclear medium. Information about the medium modifications of the internal\\nstructure of the hadrons are fundamental for the study of dense nuclear matter\\nand high energy processes including heavy-ion and nucleus-nucleus collisions.\\nAt the moment, however, the empirical information about the medium\\nmodifications of the hadrons is limited, therefore, theoretical studies are\\nessential for the progress in the field. In the present work we review\\ntheoretical studies of the electromagnetic and axial form factors of octet\\nbaryons in symmetric nuclear matter. The calculations are based on a model that\\ntakes into account the degrees of freedom revealed on experimental studies of\\nthe low and intermediate square transfer momentum $q^2=-Q^2$: valence quarks\\nand meson cloud excitations of the baryon cores. The formalism combines a\\ncovariant constituent quark model, developed for the free space (vacuum) with\\nthe quark-meson coupling model for the extension to the nuclear medium. We\\nconclude that the nuclear medium modifies the baryon properties differently\\naccording to the flavor content of the baryons and the medium density. The\\neffects of the medium increase with the density, and are stronger (quenched or\\nenhanced) for light baryons than for heavy baryons. In particular, the\\nin-medium neutrino-nucleon and antineutrino-nucleon cross sections are reduced\\ncompared to the values in free space. The proposed formalism can be extended to\\ndensities above the normal nuclear density and applied to neutrino-hyperon and\\nantineutrino-hyperon scattering in dense nuclear matter.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,hep-ex,hep-lat,hep-ph,nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T07:35:42Z\"}"}
