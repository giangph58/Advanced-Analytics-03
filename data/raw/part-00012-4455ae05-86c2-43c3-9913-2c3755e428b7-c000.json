{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13112v1\", \"title\": \"Hadamard product in deep learning: Introduction, Advances and Challenges\", \"summary\": \"While convolution and self-attention mechanisms have dominated architectural\\ndesign in deep learning, this survey examines a fundamental yet understudied\\nprimitive: the Hadamard product. Despite its widespread implementation across\\nvarious applications, the Hadamard product has not been systematically analyzed\\nas a core architectural primitive. We present the first comprehensive taxonomy\\nof its applications in deep learning, identifying four principal domains:\\nhigher-order correlation, multimodal data fusion, dynamic representation\\nmodulation, and efficient pairwise operations. The Hadamard product's ability\\nto model nonlinear interactions with linear computational complexity makes it\\nparticularly valuable for resource-constrained deployments and edge computing\\nscenarios. We demonstrate its natural applicability in multimodal fusion tasks,\\nsuch as visual question answering, and its effectiveness in representation\\nmasking for applications including image inpainting and pruning. This\\nsystematic review not only consolidates existing knowledge about the Hadamard\\nproduct's role in deep learning architectures but also establishes a foundation\\nfor future architectural innovations. Our analysis reveals the Hadamard product\\nas a versatile primitive that offers compelling trade-offs between\\ncomputational efficiency and representational power, positioning it as a\\ncrucial component in the deep learning toolkit.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:26:29Z\"}"}
