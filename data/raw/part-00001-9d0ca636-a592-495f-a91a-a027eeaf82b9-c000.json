The study incorporates\\nasymmetry and dry friction, reflecting realistic conditions. The proposed\\nmethod identifies all periodic solutions and determines their stability, and is\\napplicable to various VI-NES configurations, including horizontal and vertical\\norientations. Numerical results validate prior findings for symmetric\\nfrictionless cases and extend them to include frictional and asymmetric\\ndynamics, providing a powerful tool for optimizing the performance of VI-NES in\\nvibration mitigation.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.CD\", \"categories\": \"nlin.CD\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T10:19:43Z\"}"}
