Specifically, we study the subproduct systems\\ninduced by a finite number of complex quadratic polynomials in noncommuting\\nvariables, and describe their Toeplitz and Cuntz--Pimsner algebras. Inspired by\\nthe theory of graded associative algebras, we define a free product operation\\nin the category of subproduct systems and show that this corresponds to the\\nreduced free product of the Toeplitz algebras. Finally, we obtain results about\\nthe K-theory of the Toeplitz and Cuntz--Pimsner algebras of a large class of\\nquadratic subproduct systems.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OA\", \"categories\": \"math.OA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T10:57:58Z\"}"}
