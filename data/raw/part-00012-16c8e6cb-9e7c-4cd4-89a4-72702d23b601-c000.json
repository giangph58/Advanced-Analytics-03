Under certain\\nnecessary and sufficient conditions, we establish the existence of the HDGGI of\\na hyper-dual matrix. We then show that the HDGGI is unique (whenever exists).\\nThe HDGGI is then used to solve a linear hyper-dual system. We also exploit\\nsome sufficient conditions under which the reverse and forward-order laws for a\\nparticular form of the HDGGI and HDMPGI hold. We also discuss the least-squares\\nproperties of hyper-dual group inverse. Using the definition of dual matrix of\\norder $n$, we finally establish necessary and sufficient condition for the\\nexistence of the group inverse of a dual matrix of order $n$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RA\", \"categories\": \"math.RA,math.AC,math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T16:58:21Z\"}"}
