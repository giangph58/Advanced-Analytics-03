{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23843v1\", \"title\": \"The Problem of the Global Astrometric Sphere Reconstruction in\\n  Astrometry -- Issues and Approaches\", \"summary\": \"In this contribution we give a brief account of the problem of the Global\\nAstrometric Sphere Reconstruction in Astrometry, with particular reference to\\nthe Gaia and Gaia-like astrometric missions, namely those adopting a scanning\\nstrategy with observations in TDI mode. We sketch the design of the Gaia\\nmission, the mathematical modelling that comes naturally from its observing\\nstrategy, and how the problem of the global sphere reconstruction translates\\ninto that of the solution of large, sparse, and overdetermined system of\\nlinearized equations. After a short description of the two approaches to this\\nproblem implemented in the Gaia data reduction pipelines, we list the main\\nknown problems of the current approaches, with specific reference to the\\ncalibration and the correlation issues. Finally, we suggest how an arc-based\\nsolution could help to alleviate some of these problems, how it would be\\npossible to devise a mathematical model for such an observable despite the TDI\\nobserving mode, and the main difficulty that a parallel implementation of this\\nmodel would have to solve.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T08:45:29Z\"}"}
