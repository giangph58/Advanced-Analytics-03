The fundamental quasinormal modes and\\n$n=1$ first overtone quasinormal modes are calculated with two numerical\\nmethods, i.e. WKB method and matrix method. Impacts of model parameters on the\\nquasinormal modes are also discussed. It is found that the quasinormal modes in\\nrotating Hayward black hole have just percent-level increase compared with that\\nin the Kerr black hole case due to the deviation parameter $g$, while there is\\nten-percent-level increase for the quasinormal modes in the rotating Bardeen\\nblack hole due to $g_*$. It is also found that the monotonicity of fundamental\\nand $n=1$ quasinormal modes in the rotating Bardeen black hole is different.\\nThe corotating and counterrotating Lyapunov exponents of the equatorial null\\ncircular geodesics in the two rotating black holes are also calculated. Then,\\nthe connection between the imaginary parts and real parts of the eikonal\\nquasinormal modes, particularly the first overtone ones, and the properties of\\nthe null geodesics in the two rotating regular black holes are explicitly\\nverified.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T09:28:08Z\"}"}
