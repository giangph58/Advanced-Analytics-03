{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04730v1\", \"title\": \"Precision Thermo-Welding of Polymer Microspheres into Periodically\\n  Organized, Hybrid, Mechanically Rollable Coupled-Resonator Optical Waveguides\", \"summary\": \"Polymer microspherical resonators that trap light are crucial structures for\\non-chip and on-board integration in nanophotonic applications. Using advanced\\nmicromanipulation and thermo-welding methods, we successfully create welded\\npolystyrene-based coupled-resonator optical waveguides (CROWs) with customized\\nlengths, shapes, and optical characteristics. Through the thermal fusion of\\nblue, green, and red fluorophore-doped polystyrene microspheres,\\nmulti-fluorescent cohesive units are created from dimeric to henicosameric\\nperiodic arrangements. Detailed micro-spectroscopy studies reveal CROWs'\\ncapability to support optical whispering-gallery modes. The periodic\\narrangements of different fluorophore-doped resonators within the CROW\\nfacilitate efficient guided transmission of light via both active and passive\\nmechanisms in opposite directions. The welded structures exhibit mechanically\\ndriven rolling motion, confirming their integration as cohesive units. These\\nfindings highlight the versatility and performance of thermo-welded polymer\\nmicrosphere-based waveguides, paving the way for scalable, low-cost photonic\\ndevices in sensing, modulation, and light guiding, emphasizing their role in\\nfuture integrated photonics.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T05:02:40Z\"}"}
