{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00580v1\", \"title\": \"Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning with Circulant and Diagonal Vectors\", \"summary\": \"Foundation models have achieved tremendous success in different domains.\\nHowever, their huge computation and storage complexity make these models\\ndifficult to fine-tune and also less applicable in practice. Recent study shows\\ntraining in Fourier domain can be an effective fine-tuning method in terms of\\nboth model performance and number of training parameters. In this work, we\\npropose to further reduce the complexity by the factorization through the\\nproduct of interleaved circulant and diagonal matrices. In addition, we address\\nthe case of non-square fine-tuning weights by partitioning the circulant matrix\\ninto blocks. Our method avoids the construction of weight change matrix and\\nutilizes 1D fast Fourier transform (FFT) instead of 2D FFT. Experimental\\nresults show that our method achieves similar or better performance across\\nvarious tasks with much less floating-point operations (FLOPs) and the number\\nof trainable parameters.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T15:11:46Z\"}"}
