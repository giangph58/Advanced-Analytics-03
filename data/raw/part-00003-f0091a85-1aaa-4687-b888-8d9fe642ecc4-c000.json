{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06110v1\", \"title\": \"On the Dynamics of Mating Preferences in Genetic Programming\", \"summary\": \"Several mating restriction techniques have been implemented in Evolutionary\\nAlgorithms to promote diversity. From similarity-based selection to niche\\npreservation, the general goal is to avoid premature convergence by not having\\nfitness pressure as the single evolutionary force. In a way, such methods can\\nresemble the mechanisms involved in Sexual Selection, although generally\\nassuming a simplified approach. Recently, a selection method called mating\\nPreferences as Ideal Mating Partners (PIMP) has been applied to GP, providing\\npromising results both in performance and diversity maintenance. The method\\nmimics Mate Choice through the unbounded evolution of personal preferences\\nrather than having a single set of rules to shape parent selection. As such,\\nPIMP allows ideal mate representations to evolve freely, thus potentially\\ntaking advantage of Sexual Selection as a dynamic secondary force to fitness\\npressure. However, it is still unclear how mating preferences affect the\\noverall population and how dependent they are on set-up choices. In this work,\\nwe tracked the evolution of individual preferences through different mutation\\ntypes, searching for patterns and evidence of self-reinforcement. Results\\nsuggest that mating preferences do not stand on their own, relying on subtree\\nmutation to avoid convergence to single-node trees. Nevertheless, they\\nconsistently promote smaller and more balanced solutions depth-wise than a\\nstandard tournament selection, reducing the impact of bloat. Furthermore, when\\ncoupled with subtree mutation it also results in more solution diversity with\\nstatistically significant results.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NE\", \"categories\": \"cs.NE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:56:46Z\"}"}
