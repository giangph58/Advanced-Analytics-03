In response to climate change and the\\nneed to reduce carbon footprints, there is a growing demand for NDI solutions\\nthat are primarily non-contact, as well as non-destructive, fast, and easily\\nintegrated. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), a well-known diagnostic\\ntechnique in medical and biological research, is increasingly being used for\\nindustrial NDI. In the mid-infrared (MIR) wavelength range, OCT can be used to\\ncharacterise parts and defects not possible by other industry-ready scanners,\\nand enables better penetration than conventional near-infrared OCT.\\n  In this article, we demonstrate NDI of wind turbine blade (WTB) coatings\\nusing an MIR OCT scanner employing light around 4 $\\\\mu$m from a supercontinuum\\nsource. We inspected the top two layers of the coating (topcoat and primer) in\\ntwo different samples. The first is to determine the maximum penetration depth,\\nand the second one is to emulate defect identification. The results of our\\nstudy confirm that MIR OCT scanners are highly suitable for coating inspection\\nand quality control in the production of WTBs, with performance parameters not\\nachievable by other technologies.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T12:42:29Z\"}"}
