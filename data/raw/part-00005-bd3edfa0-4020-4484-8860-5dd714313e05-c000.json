Our\\nconstruction is based on the Lagrangian decomposition of flow maps into mean\\nand fluctuation parts, and it is separated into the following steps. First,\\nthrough Magnus expansion, the fluid velocity field is expressed in terms of\\nfluctuation vector fields whose dynamics are assumed to be stochastic. Second,\\nwe use Malliavin calculus to give a regularised interpretation of the product\\nof white noise when inserting the stochastic velocity field into the Lagrangian\\nfor Euler's fluid. Lastly, we consider closures of the mean velocity by making\\nstochastic analogues of Talyor's frozen-in turbulence hypothesis to derive a\\nversion of the anisotropic Lagrangian averaged Euler equation.\", \"main_category\": \"math-ph\", \"categories\": \"math-ph,math.MP,physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T12:29:06Z\"}"}
