Given an edge-weighted graph $G$ on n vertices, the QMC problem\\nis to determine the largest eigenvalue of a particular $2^n \\\\times 2^n$ matrix\\nthat corresponds to $G$. We provide a sharpened analysis of the currently\\nbest-known QMC approximation algorithm for general graphs. This algorithm\\nachieves an approximation ratio of $0.599$, which our analysis improves to\\n$0.603$. Additionally, we propose two new approximation algorithms for the QMC\\nproblem on triangle-free and bipartite graphs, that achieve approximation\\nratios of $0.61383$ and $0.8162$, respectively. These are the best-known\\napproximation ratios for their respective graph classes.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T12:08:07Z\"}"}
