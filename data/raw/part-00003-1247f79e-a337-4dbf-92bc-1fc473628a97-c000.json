For instance, we show that under certain assumptions, if $\\\\bar x$ is a\\n(local) optimizer of $F(x-a)$ for $x\\\\in\\\\Omega$, where $\\\\Omega\\\\subset \\\\mathcal\\nV$ is a spectral set of an EJA $\\\\mathcal V$, $a\\\\in \\\\mathcal V$ and $F:\\\\mathcal\\nV\\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb R$ is a strictly Schur-convex spectral function, then $a$\\nand $\\\\bar x$ operator commute. We make no further assumption on the smoothness\\nof $F$; instead, we take advantage of the smoothness (Lie structure) of the\\nAutomorphism group of $\\\\mathcal V$ and make use of majorization techniques for\\nthe eigenvalues of elements in EJAs. Our approach allows us to deal with\\nseveral problems considered in the literature, related to strictly convex\\nspectral functions and strictly convex spectral norms. In particular, we use\\nour commutation principles to analyze the problem of minimizing the condition\\nnumber in EJAs.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T13:24:59Z\"}"}
