Previous studies of the model focused on Kuramoto-type\\ncouplings, where the phase interactions are governed by phase differences. Here\\nwe consider Winfree-type coupling, where the interactions are multiplicative,\\ndetermined by the product of a phase response function $R(\\\\theta)$ and phase\\npulse function $P(\\\\theta)$. This more general interaction (from which the\\nKuramoto phase differences emerge after averaging) produces rich physics: six\\nlong-term modes of organization are found, which we characterize numerically\\nand analytically.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.AO\", \"categories\": \"nlin.AO,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T07:31:18Z\"}"}
