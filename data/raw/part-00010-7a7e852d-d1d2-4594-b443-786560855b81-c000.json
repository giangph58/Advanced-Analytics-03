{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04897v1\", \"title\": \"The Minimum Eternal Vertex Cover Problem on a Subclass of\\n  Series-Parallel Graphs\", \"summary\": \"Eternal vertex cover is the following two-player game between a defender and\\nan attacker on a graph. Initially, the defender positions k guards on k\\nvertices of the graph; the game then proceeds in turns between the defender and\\nthe attacker, with the attacker selecting an edge and the defender responding\\nto the attack by moving some of the guards along the edges, including the\\nattacked one. The defender wins a game on a graph G with k guards if they have\\na strategy such that, in every round of the game, the vertices occupied by the\\nguards form a vertex cover of G, and the attacker wins otherwise. The eternal\\nvertex cover number of a graph G is the smallest number k of guards allowing\\nthe defender to win and Eternal Vertex Cover is the problem of computing the\\neternal vertex cover number of the given graph.\\n  We study this problem when restricted to the well-known class of\\nseries-parallel graphs. In particular, we prove that Eternal Vertex Cover can\\nbe solved in linear time when restricted to melon graphs, a proper subclass of\\nseries-parallel graphs. Moreover, we also conjecture that this problem is\\nNP-hard on series-parallel graphs.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,cs.CC,cs.DM,cs.DS,G.2.2\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T10:12:09Z\"}"}
