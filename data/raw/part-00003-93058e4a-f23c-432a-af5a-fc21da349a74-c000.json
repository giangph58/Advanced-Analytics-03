{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17571v1\", \"title\": \"On the Eigenvalue Tracking of Large-Scale Systems\", \"summary\": \"The paper focuses on the problem of tracking eigenvalue trajectories in\\nlarge-scale power system models as system parameters vary. A continuation-based\\nformulation is presented for tracing any single eigenvalue of interest, which\\nsupports sparse matrix representations and accommodates both explicit and\\nsemi-implicit differential-algebraic models. Key implementation aspects, such\\nas numerical integration, matrix updates, derivative approximations, and\\nhandling defective eigenvalues, are discussed in detail and practical\\nrecommendations are duly provided. The tracking approach is demonstrated\\nthrough a comprehensive case study on the IEEE 39-bus system, as well as on a\\nrealistic dynamic model of the Irish transmission system.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T13:59:56Z\"}"}
