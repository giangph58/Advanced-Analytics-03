Mu-SHROOM addresses\\ngeneral-purpose LLMs in 14 languages, and frames the hallucination detection\\nproblem as a span-labeling task. We received 2,618 submissions from 43\\nparticipating teams employing diverse methodologies. The large number of\\nsubmissions underscores the interest of the community in hallucination\\ndetection. We present the results of the participating systems and conduct an\\nempirical analysis to identify key factors contributing to strong performance\\nin this task. We also emphasize relevant current challenges, notably the\\nvarying degree of hallucinations across languages and the high annotator\\ndisagreement when labeling hallucination spans.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T11:15:26Z\"}"}
