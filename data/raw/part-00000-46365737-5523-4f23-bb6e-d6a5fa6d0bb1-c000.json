Here, we\\nreport an experimental investigation on the emergence and evolution of\\nskyrmionic spin textures in the non-stoichiometric Fe3-xGaTe2 using magnetic\\nforce microscopy. The iron-deficiency-specific magnetic states of stripe,\\nstriped skyrmionium and striped skyrmion sack are observed. Through\\nzero-field-cooling and field-cooling measurements, we observed distinct\\ntopological transitions and trivial transitions (distinguished by changes in\\ntopological charge) emerging during the stepwise evolution of topological spin\\ntextures, which enabled us to develop an evolution pathway model. Leveraging\\nthis model, the room-temperature stable composite topological spin textures of\\nskyrmionium, skyrmion bag and sack states are further controllably realized via\\nthe exclusive topological-transition path (regulated by magnetic field and DMI\\nintensity). Our work provides valuable insights into the room-temperature\\nrealization of topological spin textures in Fe3-xGaTe2, and inspires further\\nexploration of their potential applications in heterostructure spintronics.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T04:32:18Z\"}"}
