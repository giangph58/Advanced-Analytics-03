{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09900v1\", \"title\": \"Small Object Detection with YOLO: A Performance Analysis Across Model\\n  Versions and Hardware\", \"summary\": \"This paper provides an extensive evaluation of YOLO object detection models\\n(v5, v8, v9, v10, v11) by com- paring their performance across various hardware\\nplatforms and optimization libraries. Our study investigates inference speed\\nand detection accuracy on Intel and AMD CPUs using popular libraries such as\\nONNX and OpenVINO, as well as on GPUs through TensorRT and other GPU-optimized\\nframeworks. Furthermore, we analyze the sensitivity of these YOLO models to\\nobject size within the image, examining performance when detecting objects that\\noccupy 1%, 2.5%, and 5% of the total area of the image. By identifying the\\ntrade-offs in efficiency, accuracy, and object size adaptability, this paper\\noffers insights for optimal model selection based on specific hardware\\nconstraints and detection requirements, aiding practitioners in deploying YOLO\\nmodels effectively for real-world applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T05:49:31Z\"}"}
