For superconducting qubits,\\nreadout and reset are typically realized using resonators based on dispersive\\napproximation. However, violations of the approximation often lead to\\ndetrimental effects on the qubit. In this work, we demonstrate non-demolition\\nfluorescence readout and high-fidelity unconditional reset of a fluxonium qubit\\nvia dissipation engineering without employing a resonator. We design and\\nimplement a planar filter to protect the qubit from energy relaxation while\\nenhancing the relaxation of the readout transition. By appropriately selecting\\nthe readout transition, we achieve fluorescence readout with enhanced quantum\\nnon-demolitionness. We also realize fast, high-fidelity and all-microwave\\nunconditional reset of the fluxonium qubit. These results highlight the\\npotential of superconducting-quantum computing architectures without relying on\\ndispersive interaction between qubits and resonators.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T13:41:30Z\"}"}
