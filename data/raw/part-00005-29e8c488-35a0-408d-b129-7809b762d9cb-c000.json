Rev. Lett.\\n$\\\\textbf{122}$, 190402 (2019)] and [Phys. Rev. A $\\\\textbf{103}$, 012213 (2021)]\\nregarding the Wigner function of the so-called smoothed Weak-Valued state (SWV\\nstate). Here smoothing refers to estimation of properties at time $t$ using\\ninformation obtained in measurements both before and after $t$. The SWV state\\nis a pseudo-state (Hermitian but not necessarily positive) that gives, by the\\nusual trace formula, the correct value for a weak measurement preformed at time\\n$t$, $\\\\textit{i.e.}$, its weak value. The Wigner function is a\\npseudo-probability-distribution (real but not necessarily positive) over\\nphase-space. A smoothed (in this estimation sense) Wigner distribution at time\\n$t$ can also be defined by applying classical smoothing for\\nprobability-distributions to the Wigner functions. The smoothed Wigner\\ndistribution (SWD) gives identical means for the canonical phase-space\\nvariables as does the SWV state. However, contrary to the assumption in the\\nabove references, the Wigner function of the SWV state is not the smoothed\\nWigner distribution.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T06:38:20Z\"}"}
