{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05214v1\", \"title\": \"Overcoming the hurdle of legal expertise: A reusable model for\\n  smartwatch privacy policies\", \"summary\": \"Regulations for privacy protection aim to protect individuals from the\\nunauthorized storage, processing, and transfer of their personal data but\\noftentimes fail in providing helpful support for understanding these\\nregulations. To better communicate privacy policies for smartwatches, we need\\nan in-depth understanding of their concepts and provide better ways to enable\\ndevelopers to integrate them when engineering systems. Up to now, no conceptual\\nmodel exists covering privacy statements from different smartwatch\\nmanufacturers that is reusable for developers. This paper introduces such a\\nconceptual model for privacy policies of smartwatches and shows its use in a\\nmodel-driven software engineering approach to create a platform for data\\nvisualization of wearable privacy policies from different smartwatch\\nmanufacturers. We have analyzed the privacy policies of various manufacturers\\nand extracted the relevant concepts. Moreover, we have checked the model with\\nlawyers for its correctness, instantiated it with concrete data, and used it in\\na model-driven software engineering approach to create a platform for data\\nvisualization. This reusable privacy policy model can enable developers to\\neasily represent privacy policies in their systems. This provides a foundation\\nfor more structured and understandable privacy policies which, in the long run,\\ncan increase the data sovereignty of application users.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:09:12Z\"}"}
