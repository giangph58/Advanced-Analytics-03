{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16050v1\", \"title\": \"The jet and circumstellar environment of the young binary DF Tau\", \"summary\": \"Jets and disc winds play an important role in the evolution of protoplanetary\\ndiscs and the formation of planetary systems. However, there is still a lack of\\nobservational data regarding the presence and parameters of outflows,\\nespecially for close young binaries. In this study, we aim to find the HH flow\\nnear the young sub-arcsecond binary DF Tau and explore its morphology.\\nNarrow-band H$\\\\alpha$ and H$_2$ 2.12 $\\\\mu$m imaging and spectroscopic\\nobservations of DF Tau and its vicinity were performed. We have discovered\\nseveral emission nebulae near the binary, which likely result from the\\ninteraction of gas outflow from the binary components with the surrounding\\nmedium. The outflow appears to occur both in the form of jets, generating\\nnumerous Herbig-Haro objects (HH 1266 flow), and as a weakly collimated wind\\nresponsible for the formation of the ring-like nebula around the binary and the\\nrim of the cometary globule. We have found that the angle between the jet and\\nthe counter-jet is $168^\\\\circ$ and discuss the complex morphology of the HH\\nflow.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T17:27:17Z\"}"}
