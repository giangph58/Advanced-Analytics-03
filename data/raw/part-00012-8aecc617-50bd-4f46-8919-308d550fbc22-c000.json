Exploring AI-Generated Counterspeech to\\n  Challenge Conspiracy Theories\", \"summary\": \"Counterspeech is a key strategy against harmful online content, but scaling\\nexpert-driven efforts is challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a\\npotential solution, though their use in countering conspiracy theories is\\nunder-researched. Unlike for hate speech, no datasets exist that pair\\nconspiracy theory comments with expert-crafted counterspeech. We address this\\ngap by evaluating the ability of GPT-4o, Llama 3, and Mistral to effectively\\napply counterspeech strategies derived from psychological research provided\\nthrough structured prompts. Our results show that the models often generate\\ngeneric, repetitive, or superficial results. Additionally, they\\nover-acknowledge fear and frequently hallucinate facts, sources, or figures,\\nmaking their prompt-based use in practical applications problematic.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI,cs.SI,I.2.7\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T10:32:45Z\"}"}
