The\\ninterplay between order parameters of the separate layers makes twisted\\nsuperconductors unique, leading to additional emergent phenomena in regimes\\nusually not of importance in moir\\\\'e physics, such as bulk interfaces and large\\ntwist angles. We review the physics of twisted nodal superconductors,\\nhighlighting both similarities and qualitative differences with other moir\\\\'e\\nplatforms. While inspired by the rise of moir\\\\'e materials, the field is\\nanchored in studies of unconventional superconductivity preceding the moir\\\\'e\\nera, which we discuss in detail. In addition to summarizing the developments at\\nthe present stage, we present a detailed outlook on the major open questions in\\nthe field and some of the most exciting future directions.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T03:15:27Z\"}"}
