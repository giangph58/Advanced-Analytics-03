{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03587v1\", \"title\": \"Meta-reasoning Using Attention Maps and Its Applications in Cloud\\n  Robotics\", \"summary\": \"Metareasoning, a branch of AI, focuses on reasoning about reasons. It has the\\npotential to enhance robots' decision-making processes in unexpected\\nsituations. However, the concept has largely been confined to theoretical\\ndiscussions and case-by-case investigations, lacking general and practical\\nsolutions when the Value of Computation (VoC) is undefined, which is common in\\nunexpected situations. In this work, we propose a revised meta-reasoning\\nframework that significantly improves the scalability of the original approach\\nin unexpected situations. This is achieved by incorporating semantic attention\\nmaps and unsupervised 'attention' updates into the metareasoning processes. To\\naccommodate environmental dynamics, 'lines of thought' are used to bridge\\ncontext-specific objects with abstracted attentions, while meta-information is\\nmonitored and controlled at the meta-level for effective reasoning. The\\npracticality of the proposed approach is demonstrated through cloud robots\\ndeployed in real-world scenarios, showing improved performance and robustness.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T14:48:29Z\"}"}
