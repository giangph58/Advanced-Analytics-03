Our main result\\nestablishes an observability inequality for the adjoint system, from which we\\ndeduce approximate controllability at final time . The proof relies on a\\nlogarithmic convexity argument, developed through a Carleman commutator\\napproach.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T16:06:12Z\"}"}
