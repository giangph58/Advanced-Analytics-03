The method is based on a\\nspectral formulation of Maxwell's equations called the Bidirectional Pulse\\nPropagation Equations. The scheme can be applied to a wide array of slab-like\\ngeometries, and for arbitrary material responses. We derive the scheme and\\ninvestigated how it performs with respect to convergence and accuracy by\\napplying it to the case of light scattering from a simple slab whose nonlinear\\nmaterial response is a sum a very fast electronic vibrational response, and a\\nmuch slower molecular vibrational response.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.class-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.class-ph,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T16:38:49Z\"}"}
