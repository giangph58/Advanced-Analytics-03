The challenge features two tracks: MOSE, which focuses on\\ncomplex scene video object segmentation, and MeViS, which targets\\nmotion-guided, language-based video segmentation. Both tracks introduce new,\\nmore challenging datasets designed to better reflect real-world scenarios.\\nThrough detailed evaluation and analysis, the challenge offers valuable\\ninsights into the current state-of-the-art and emerging trends in complex video\\nsegmentation.
