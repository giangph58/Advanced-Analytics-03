{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05154v1\", \"title\": \"CARE: Aligning Language Models for Regional Cultural Awareness\", \"summary\": \"Existing language models (LMs) often exhibit a Western-centric bias and\\nstruggle to represent diverse cultural knowledge. Previous attempts to address\\nthis rely on synthetic data and express cultural knowledge only in English. In\\nthis work, we study whether a small amount of human-written, multilingual\\ncultural preference data can improve LMs across various model families and\\nsizes. We first introduce CARE, a multilingual resource of 24.1k responses with\\nhuman preferences on 2,580 questions about Chinese and Arab cultures, all\\ncarefully annotated by native speakers and offering more balanced coverage.\\nUsing CARE, we demonstrate that cultural alignment improves existing LMs beyond\\ngeneric resources without compromising general capabilities. Moreover, we\\nevaluate the cultural awareness of LMs, native speakers, and retrieved web\\ncontent when queried in different languages. Our experiment reveals regional\\ndisparities among LMs, which may also be reflected in the documentation gap:\\nnative speakers often take everyday cultural commonsense and social norms for\\ngranted, while non-natives are more likely to actively seek out and document\\nthem. CARE is publicly available at https://github.com/Guochry/CARE (we plan to\\nadd Japanese data in the near future).\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:57:06Z\"}"}
