The\\nLagrangian approach for the solution of the optimization problem is presented,\\nand optimality conditions are derived. The proof of the Fr\\\\'echet\\ndifferentiability of the regularized Tikhonov functional and the existence\\nresult for the solution of the inverse source problem are established. A local\\nstability estimate for the unknown source term is also presented. The numerical\\nexamples justify the theoretical investigations using the conjugate gradient\\nmethod (CGM) in 2D and 3D tests with noisy data.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T17:51:31Z\"}"}
