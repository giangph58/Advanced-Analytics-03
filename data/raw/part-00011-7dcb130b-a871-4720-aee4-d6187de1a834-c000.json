{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05394v1\", \"title\": \"Effect of Levy noise on the network of coupled Chialvo neurons: Impact\\n  of topology\", \"summary\": \"This research investigates the complex spatiotemporal behaviors of Chialvo\\nneuron maps under the influence of Levy noise on three different network\\ntopologies that is a ring network, a two dimensional lattice affected by\\nelectromagnetic flux, and a delayed coupled lattice. On the ring structure, we\\nshow that adding non uniform Levy noise induces the formation of new collective\\ndynamics like standing and traveling waves. The frequency and type of these\\nemergent patterns depend sensitively on the intrinsic excitability parameter\\nand the noise intensity, revealing new pathways to control synchronization\\nbehavior through noise modulation. In the 2D lattice network, we show that\\nelectromagnetic flux and noise together induce a diverse range of behaviors,\\nfrom synchronized waves to desynchronized states. Most strikingly, spiral wave\\nchimeras emerge under moderate noise, with coherent and incoherent regions\\ncoexisting, highlighting the fine balance between external forcing and\\nstochastic perturbations. Finally, upon introducing delay in the lattice\\nstructure, the system displays a rich variety of dynamical regimes such as\\nlabyrinth patterns, rotating spirals, and target waves whose stability and\\ntransitions are greatly affected by both delay and coupling strength.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.AO\", \"categories\": \"nlin.AO,nlin.PS\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T16:29:43Z\"}"}
