{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11216v1\", \"title\": \"Diversity-Driven Learning: Tackling Spurious Correlations and Data\\n  Heterogeneity in Federated Models\", \"summary\": \"Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized training of machine learning\\nmodels on distributed data while preserving privacy. However, in real-world FL\\nsettings, client data is often non-identically distributed and imbalanced,\\nresulting in statistical data heterogeneity which impacts the generalization\\ncapabilities of the server's model across clients, slows convergence and\\nreduces performance. In this paper, we address this challenge by first\\nproposing a characterization of statistical data heterogeneity by means of 6\\nmetrics of global and client attribute imbalance, class imbalance, and spurious\\ncorrelations. Next, we create and share 7 computer vision datasets for binary\\nand multiclass image classification tasks in Federated Learning that cover a\\nbroad range of statistical data heterogeneity and hence simulate real-world\\nsituations. Finally, we propose FedDiverse, a novel client selection algorithm\\nin FL which is designed to manage and leverage data heterogeneity across\\nclients by promoting collaboration between clients with complementary data\\ndistributions. Experiments on the seven proposed FL datasets demonstrate\\nFedDiverse's effectiveness in enhancing the performance and robustness of a\\nvariety of FL methods while having low communication and computational\\noverhead.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:20:42Z\"}"}
