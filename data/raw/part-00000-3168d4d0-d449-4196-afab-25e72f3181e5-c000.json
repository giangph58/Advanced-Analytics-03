They are widely\\nused in decision making under uncertain data in many engineering problems. This\\npaper aims to derive the convexity of chance constraints with row dependent\\nelliptical and skewed random variables via a copula depending on decision\\nvectors. We obtain best thresholds of the $r$-concavity for any real number $r$\\nand improve probability thresholds of the eventual convexity. We prove the\\neventual convexity with elliptical distributions and a Gumbel-Hougaard copula\\ndespite the copula's singularity near the origin. We determine the\\n$\\\\alpha$-decreasing densities of generalized hyperbolic distributions by\\nestimating the modified Bessel functions. By applying the $\\\\alpha$-decreasing\\nproperty and a radial decomposition, we achieve the eventual convexity for\\nthree types of skewed distributions. Finally, we provide an example to\\nillustrate the eventual convexity of a feasible set containing the origin.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:38:27Z\"}"}
