While there\\nis ongoing research on enabling camera calibration using natural images, many\\nsystems in practice still rely on using designated calibration targets with\\ne.g. checkerboard patterns or April tag grids. Once calibration images from\\ndifferent perspectives have been acquired and feature descriptors detected,\\nthose are typically used in an optimization process to minimize the geometric\\nreprojection error. For this optimization to converge, input images need to be\\nof sufficient quality and particularly sharpness; they should neither contain\\nmotion blur nor rolling-shutter artifacts that can arise when the calibration\\nboard was not static during image capture. In this work, we present a novel\\ncalibration image acquisition technique controlled via voice commands recorded\\nwith a clip-on microphone, that can be more robust and user-friendly than e.g.\\ntriggering capture with a remote control, or filtering out blurry frames from a\\nvideo sequence in postprocessing. To achieve this, we use a state-of-the-art\\nspeech-to-text transcription model with accurate per-word timestamping to\\ncapture trigger words with precise temporal alignment. Our experiments show\\nthat the proposed method improves user experience by being fast and efficient,\\nallowing us to successfully calibrate complex multi-camera setups.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T09:54:43Z\"}"}
