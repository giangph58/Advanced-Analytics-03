We consider an $N$-partite network\\nwhere entanglement is distributed via a central source over lossy channels, and\\nnetwork participants cooperate to establish entanglement between any two chosen\\nparties under local operations and classical communication (LOCC) constraints.\\nWe develop a general mathematical framework to assess the optimal average\\nbipartite entanglement shared in a lossy distribution, and introduce a\\ntractable lower bound by optimizing over a subset of single-parameter LOCC\\ntransformations. Our results show that probabilistically extracting Bell pairs\\nfrom W states is more advantageous than deterministically extracting them from\\nGHZ-like states in lossy networks, with this advantage increasing with network\\nsize. We further extend our analysis analytically, proving that W states remain\\nmore effective in large-scale networks. These findings offer valuable insights\\ninto the practical deployment of near-term networks, revealing a fundamental\\ntrade-off between deterministic entanglement distribution protocols and\\nloss-sensitive resources.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:32:18Z\"}"}
