However, for industrial anomaly detection, the scarcity\\nof real defect samples poses a critical challenge in leveraging these models.\\nWhile 2D anomaly generation has significantly advanced with established\\ngenerative models, the adoption of 3D sensors in industrial manufacturing has\\nmade leveraging 3D data for surface quality inspection an emerging trend. In\\ncontrast to 2D techniques, 3D anomaly generation remains largely unexplored,\\nlimiting the potential of 3D data in industrial quality inspection. To address\\nthis gap, we propose a novel yet simple 3D anomaly generation method, 3D-PNAS,\\nbased on Perlin noise and surface parameterization. Our method generates\\nrealistic 3D surface anomalies by projecting the point cloud onto a 2D plane,\\nsampling multi-scale noise values from a Perlin noise field, and perturbing the\\npoint cloud along its normal direction. Through comprehensive visualization\\nexperiments, we demonstrate how key parameters - including noise scale,\\nperturbation strength, and octaves, provide fine-grained control over the\\ngenerated anomalies, enabling the creation of diverse defect patterns from\\npronounced deformations to subtle surface variations. Additionally, our\\ncross-category experiments show that the method produces consistent yet\\ngeometrically plausible anomalies across different object types, adapting to\\ntheir specific surface characteristics. We also provide a comprehensive\\ncodebase and visualization toolkit to facilitate future research.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GR\", \"categories\": \"cs.GR,cs.AI,cs.CV,cs.LG,cs.RO,I.5.4\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T11:23:17Z\"}"}
