The complexity of\\na pose estimation task depends on the unknown variables related to the target\\nobject. While instance-level methods already excel for opaque and Lambertian\\nobjects, category-level and open-set methods, where texture, shape, and size\\nare partially or entirely unknown, still struggle with these basic material\\nproperties. Since texture is unknown in these scenarios, it cannot be used for\\ndisambiguating object symmetries, another core challenge of 6D object pose\\nestimation. The complexity of estimating 6D poses with such a manifold of\\nunknowns led to various datasets, accuracy metrics, and algorithmic solutions.\\nThis paper compares datasets, accuracy metrics, and algorithms for solving 6D\\npose estimation on the category-level. Based on this comparison, we analyze how\\nto bridge category-level and open-set object pose estimation to reach\\ngeneralization and provide actionable recommendations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T08:31:33Z\"}"}
