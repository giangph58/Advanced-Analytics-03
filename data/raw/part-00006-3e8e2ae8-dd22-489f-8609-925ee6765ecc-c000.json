They are defined as the linear combination of the\\nthree internuclear distances that automatically fulfils the triangle inequality\\nfor all non-negative coordinate values. In this work, we test three discrete\\nvariable representations (DVR) for tightly converging the rovibrational\\nenergies up to and beyond the barrier to linearity using the Pekeris\\ncoordinates. The best performing representation is a cot-DVR-type approach\\nadapted to the Pekeris problem. The two- and three-proton near coalescence\\nregion, which is also part of the direct product Pekeris grid but dynamically\\nnot relevant, is avoided by coordinate mapping.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:30:04Z\"}"}
