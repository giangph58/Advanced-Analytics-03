Previous work indicates that\\nthe overall scale of the inhomogeneities is set by the scale of the currents,\\nthat the inhomogeneities are strongly anisotropic even for isotropic currents,\\nand that the rotational and divergent components of the currents have sharply\\ndistinct effects. We explain these and other features of current-induced SWH\\ninhomogeneities using the U2H map, a linear relation between SWH and currents\\ndeduced from wave-action conservation by making simplifying assumptions. We\\nobtain a linear law relating the spectrum of SWH to the spectra of rotational\\nand divergent kinetic energy of the current. This makes it possible to relate\\nSWH statistics (such as variance and anisotropy) to the current statistics and\\nwave properties including directional spreading.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn,physics.ao-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T15:31:58Z\"}"}
