Active\\nvolume architectures, with long-range connectivity, aim to remove idle\\nspacetime volume leaving only the spacetime volume that logically contributes\\nto a computation. In this work we optimise and derive the active volumes for\\nseveral industry-leading low- and high-level arithmetic subroutines and achieve\\nsignificant T-count reductions. We discuss a simple method for estimating and\\noptimising active volumes using orientated ZX diagrams. We also demonstrate\\nthat circuit structure, beyond gate counts alone, impacts the active volume of\\na subroutine and therefore should be taken into consideration when designing\\ncircuits.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T09:38:55Z\"}"}
