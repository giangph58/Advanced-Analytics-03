{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19756v1\", \"title\": \"Logic-based Resilience Computation of Power Systems Against Frequency\\n  Requirements\", \"summary\": \"Incorporating renewable energy sources into modern power grids has\\nsignificantly decreased system inertia, which has raised concerns about power\\nsystem vulnerability to disturbances and frequency instability. The\\nconventional methods for evaluating transient stability by bounding frequency\\ndeviations are often conservative and may not accurately reflect real-world\\nconditions and operational constraints. To address this, we propose a framework\\nfor assessing the resilience of power systems against disturbances while\\nadhering to realistic operational frequency constraints. Our approach leverages\\nthe Lure system representation of power system dynamics and Signal Temporal\\nLogic (STL) to capture the essential frequency response requirements set by\\ngrid operators. This enables us to translate frequency constraints into formal\\nrobustness semantics. We then formulate an optimization problem to identify the\\nmaximum disturbance that the system can withstand without violating these\\nconstraints. The resulting optimization is translated into a scenario\\noptimization while addressing the uncertainty in the obtained solution. The\\nproposed methodology has been simulated on the Single Machine Infinite Bus case\\nstudy and 9-Bus IEEE benchmark system, demonstrating its effectiveness in\\nassessing resilience across various operating conditions and delivering\\npromising results.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T12:54:55Z\"}"}
