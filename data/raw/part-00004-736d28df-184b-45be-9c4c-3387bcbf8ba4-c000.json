In the considered model, a multi-antenna UAV employs semantic\\nextraction techniques to compress the data ready to be sent to the users, which\\nare equipped with fluid antennas. Our aim is to jointly optimize the trajectory\\nof the UAV, the transmit beamforming and the semantic compression rate at the\\nUAV, as well as the selection of activated ports in fluid antenna system (FAS),\\nto maximize the minimum equivalent transmission rate among all user. An\\nalternating algorithm is designed to solve the problem. Simulation results\\nvalidate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:10:55Z\"}"}
