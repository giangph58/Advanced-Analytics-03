This paper presents a ROS2-based software library\\ndesigned to solve the inverse dynamics problem for robotic systems. The library\\nis built around an abstract class with three concrete implementations: one for\\nsimulated robots and two for real UR10 and Franka robots. This contribution\\naims to provide a flexible, extensible, robot-agnostic solution to inverse\\ndynamics, suitable for both simulation and real-world scenarios involving\\nplanning and control applications.
