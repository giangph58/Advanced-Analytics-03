Using this definition we define quasisymmetric\\ngeneralizations of the theory of double Schur and double Schubert polynomials\\nthat we call double fundamental polynomials and double forest polynomials,\\nwhere the subset of ``noncrossing partitions'' plays the role of $S_n$. In\\nsubsequent work we will show this combinatorics is governed by a new geometric\\nconstruction we call the ``quasisymmetric flag variety'' which plays the same\\nrole for equivariant quasisymmetry as the usual flag variety plays in the\\nclassical story.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T17:09:52Z\"}"}
