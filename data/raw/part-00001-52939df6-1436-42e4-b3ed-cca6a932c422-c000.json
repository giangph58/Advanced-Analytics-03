Here, we\\nreport a breakthrough approach employing a reversibly adhesion-switchable\\nphase-changing polymer to transfer commercial photoresists onto previously\\ninaccessible substrates. It achieves wafer-scale (4-inch) transfer with global\\nregistration error below 60 microns and support precise patterning on\\nsolvent-sensitive, curved, microtextured or delicate surfaces. Combined with\\ndry etching, we demonstrated high-resolution patterning of quantum dots and\\norganic semiconductors. The process also supports a sustainable dry lift-off\\nfor patterning functional materials. The reusability of both the transfer\\ncarrier and photoresist introduces a new level of sustainability and\\nscalability, establishing a significant advancement in microfabrication. We\\nadditionally fabricated a micro-sized UV-photodetector array directly on a\\ncurved glass bottle to demonstrate this unprecedented capability.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T13:08:04Z\"}"}
