Recent works have generalized this concept to the\\ndomain of mixed states in open quantum systems, where symmetries can be\\nrealized in two distinct ways dubbed strong and weak. Novel intrinsically mixed\\nphases of quantum matter can then be defined by the spontaneous breaking of\\nstrong symmetry down to weak symmetry. However, proposed order parameters for\\nstrong-to-weak SSB (based on mixed-state fidelities or purities) seem to\\nrequire exponentially many copies of the state, raising the question: is it\\npossible to efficiently detect strong-to-weak SSB in general? Here we answer\\nthis question negatively in the paradigmatic cases of $Z_2$ and $U(1)$\\nsymmetries. We construct ensembles of pseudorandom mixed states that do not\\nbreak the strong symmetry, yet are computationally indistinguishable from\\nstates that do. This rules out the existence of efficient state-agnostic\\nprotocols to detect strong-to-weak SSB.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.stat-mech,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T16:31:27Z\"}"}
