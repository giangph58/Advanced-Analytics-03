{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13132v1\", \"title\": \"Cosmological Parameters Estimate from Persistent Radio Sources of Fast\\n  Radio Bursts\", \"summary\": \"We introduce a novel method to constrain the Hubble constant ($H_0$) by\\ncombining fast radio bursts (FRBs) and their persistent radio sources (PRSs)\\nthrough the observationally validated Yang relation, $ L_{\\\\nu} \\\\propto |\\n\\\\mathrm{RM} | $, which links PRS luminosity to the rotation measure (RM) of the\\nassociated FRB. Using a mock sample of PRSs, we demonstrate that the Yang\\nrelation can help to unravel the degeneracies among $H_0$, baryon density\\nparameter $\\\\Omega_b$, and baryon fraction in the intergalactic medium\\n$f_{\\\\mathrm{IGM}}$ in the traditional approach of using dispersion measure only\\nto perform cosmological analyses. Our method employs a two-stage Markov Chain\\nMonte Carlo (MCMC) analysis to constrain $H_0$. Using the available data of six\\nobserved PRS systems, we obtain a preliminary constraint of $H_0 = 75 \\\\pm\\n30~\\\\mathrm{km\\\\,s^{-1}\\\\,Mpc^{-1}}$. We briefly discuss possible refinements of\\nthe method by reducing residual degeneracies and systematic uncertainties using\\nfuture data and physical modeling. Our results indicate that the Yang relation\\ncan potentially become a new probe for performing FRB cosmology.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:45:58Z\"}"}
