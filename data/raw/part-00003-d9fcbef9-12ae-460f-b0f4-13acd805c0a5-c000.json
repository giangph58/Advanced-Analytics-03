However, how to effectively train the network without using\\nreal-world labels remains a challenging problem. In this paper, driven by the\\nrecent advancements of vision foundation models, a novel method termed DFM-MVS,\\nis proposed to leverage the depth foundation model to generate the effective\\ndepth prior, so as to boost MVS in the absence of real-world labels.\\nSpecifically, a depth prior-based pseudo-supervised training mechanism is\\ndeveloped to simulate realistic stereo correspondences using the generated\\ndepth prior, thereby constructing effective supervision for the MVS network.\\nBesides, a depth prior-guided error correction strategy is presented to\\nleverage the depth prior as guidance to mitigate the error propagation problem\\ninherent in the widely-used coarse-to-fine network structure. Experimental\\nresults on DTU and Tanks & Temples datasets demonstrate that the proposed\\nDFM-MVS significantly outperforms existing MVS methods without using real-world\\nlabels.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T08:07:09Z\"}"}
