{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12776v1\", \"title\": \"StorySets: Ordering Curves and Dimensions for Visualizing Uncertain Sets\\n  and Multi-Dimensional Discrete Data\", \"summary\": \"We propose a method for visualizing uncertain set systems, which differs from\\nprevious set visualization approaches that are based on certainty (an element\\neither belongs to a set or not). Our method is inspired by storyline\\nvisualizations and parallel coordinate plots: (a) each element is represented\\nby a vertical glyph, subdivided into bins that represent different levels of\\nuncertainty; (b) each set is represented by an x-monotone curve that traverses\\nelement glyphs through the bins representing the level of uncertainty of their\\nmembership. Our implementation also includes optimizations to reduce visual\\ncomplexity captured by the number of turns for the set curves and the number of\\ncrossings. Although several of the natural underlying optimization problems are\\nNP-hard in theory (e.g., optimal element order, optimal set order), in\\npractice, we can compute near-optimal solutions with respect to curve crossings\\nwith the help of a new exact algorithm for optimally ordering set curves within\\neach element's bins. With these optimizations, the proposed method makes it\\neasy to see set containment (the smaller set's curve is strictly below the\\nlarger set's curve). A brief design-space exploration using uncertain\\nset-membership data, as well as multi-dimensional discrete data, shows the\\nflexibility of the proposed approach.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GR\", \"categories\": \"cs.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T09:18:02Z\"}"}
