The theory traces out photonic degrees of freedom in\\nplasma and accounts for plasma dynamics mediated by photons by calculated\\neffective Hamiltonian. New modes of propagation have been predicted along with\\nsuppression of fields and collective behaviour. Non-Markovian behaviour is also\\ndiscovered for plasma states and interactions in finite plasma system. This\\nfinds applicability in solid-state plasma, plasma confinement of magnetic and\\ninertial nature, and laser-plasma interaction when theory is reduced to local\\ninteractions.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T09:10:19Z\"}"}
