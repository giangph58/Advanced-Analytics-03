{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12772v1\", \"title\": \"Artifacts in Photoacoustic Imaging: Origins and Mitigations\", \"summary\": \"Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is rapidly moving from the laboratory to the\\nclinic, increasing the need to understand confounders which might adversely\\naffect patient care. Over the past five years, landmark studies have shown the\\nclinical utility of PAI, leading to regulatory approval of several devices. In\\nthis article, we describe the various causes of artifacts in PAI, providing\\nschematic overviews and practical examples, simulated as well as experimental.\\nThis work serves two purposes: (1) educating clinical users to identify\\nartifacts, understand their causes, and assess whether their impact, and (2)\\nproviding a reference of the limitations of current systems for those working\\nto improve them. We explain how two aspects of PAI systems lead to artifacts:\\ntheir inability to measure complete data sets, and embedded assumptions during\\nreconstruction. We describe the physics underlying PAI, and propose a\\nclassification of the artifacts. The paper concludes by discussing possible\\nadvanced mitigation strategies.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.med-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.med-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T09:13:27Z\"}"}
