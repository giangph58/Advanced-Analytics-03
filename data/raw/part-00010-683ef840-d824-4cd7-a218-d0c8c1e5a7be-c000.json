{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07929v1\", \"title\": \"Market-Based Portfolio Selection\", \"summary\": \"We show that Markowitz's (1952) decomposition of a portfolio variance as a\\nquadratic form in the variables of the relative amounts invested into the\\nsecurities, which has been the core of classical portfolio theory for more than\\n70 years, is valid only in the approximation when all trade volumes with all\\nsecurities of the portfolio are assumed constant. We derive the market-based\\nportfolio variance and its decomposition by its securities, which accounts for\\nthe impact of random trade volumes and is a polynomial of the 4th degree in the\\nvariables of the relative amounts invested into the securities. To do that, we\\ntransform the time series of market trades with the securities of the portfolio\\nand obtain the time series of trades with the portfolio as a single market\\nsecurity. The time series of market trades determine the market-based means and\\nvariances of prices and returns of the portfolio in the same form as the means\\nand variances of any market security. The decomposition of the market-based\\nvariance of returns of the portfolio by its securities follows from the\\nstructure of the time series of market trades of the portfolio as a single\\nsecurity. The market-based decompositions of the portfolio's variances of\\nprices and returns could help the managers of multi-billion portfolios and the\\ndevelopers of large market and macroeconomic models like BlackRock's Aladdin,\\nJP Morgan, and the U.S. Fed adjust their models and forecasts to the reality of\\nrandom markets.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,q-fin.EC,q-fin.GN,q-fin.PM,q-fin.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:44:57Z\"}"}
