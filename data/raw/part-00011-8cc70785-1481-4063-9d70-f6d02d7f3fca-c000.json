{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00334v1\", \"title\": \"Quaternion Wavelet-Conditioned Diffusion Models for Image\\n  Super-Resolution\", \"summary\": \"Image Super-Resolution is a fundamental problem in computer vision with broad\\napplications spacing from medical imaging to satellite analysis. The ability to\\nreconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs is crucial for\\nenhancing downstream tasks such as object detection and segmentation. While\\ndeep learning has significantly advanced SR, achieving high-quality\\nreconstructions with fine-grained details and realistic textures remains\\nchallenging, particularly at high upscaling factors. Recent approaches\\nleveraging diffusion models have demonstrated promising results, yet they often\\nstruggle to balance perceptual quality with structural fidelity. In this work,\\nwe introduce ResQu a novel SR framework that integrates a quaternion wavelet\\npreprocessing framework with latent diffusion models, incorporating a new\\nquaternion wavelet- and time-aware encoder. Unlike prior methods that simply\\napply wavelet transforms within diffusion models, our approach enhances the\\nconditioning process by exploiting quaternion wavelet embeddings, which are\\ndynamically integrated at different stages of denoising. Furthermore, we also\\nleverage the generative priors of foundation models such as Stable Diffusion.\\nExtensive experiments on domain-specific datasets demonstrate that our method\\nachieves outstanding SR results, outperforming in many cases existing\\napproaches in perceptual quality and standard evaluation metrics. The code will\\nbe available after the revision process.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T06:17:33Z\"}"}
