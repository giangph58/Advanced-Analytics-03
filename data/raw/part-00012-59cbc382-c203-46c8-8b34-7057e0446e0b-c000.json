{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16655v1\", \"title\": \"WiFi based Human Fall and Activity Recognition using Transformer based\\n  Encoder Decoder and Graph Neural Networks\", \"summary\": \"Human pose estimation and action recognition have received attention due to\\ntheir critical roles in healthcare monitoring, rehabilitation, and assistive\\ntechnologies. In this study, we proposed a novel architecture named Transformer\\nbased Encoder Decoder Network (TED Net) designed for estimating human skeleton\\nposes from WiFi Channel State Information (CSI). TED Net integrates\\nconvolutional encoders with transformer based attention mechanisms to capture\\nspatiotemporal features from CSI signals. The estimated skeleton poses were\\nused as input to a customized Directed Graph Neural Network (DGNN) for action\\nrecognition. We validated our model on two datasets: a publicly available multi\\nmodal dataset for assessing general pose estimation, and a newly collected\\ndataset focused on fall related scenarios involving 20 participants.\\nExperimental results demonstrated that TED Net outperformed existing approaches\\nin pose estimation, and that the DGNN achieves reliable action classification\\nusing CSI based skeletons, with performance comparable to RGB based systems.\\nNotably, TED Net maintains robust performance across both fall and non fall\\ncases. These findings highlight the potential of CSI driven human skeleton\\nestimation for effective action recognition, particularly in home environments\\nsuch as elderly fall detection. In such settings, WiFi signals are often\\nreadily available, offering a privacy preserving alternative to vision based\\nmethods, which may raise concerns about continuous camera monitoring.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T12:22:24Z\"}"}
