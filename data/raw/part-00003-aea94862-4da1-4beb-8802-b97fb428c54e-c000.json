{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10978v1\", \"title\": \"AgentPolyp: Accurate Polyp Segmentation via Image Enhancement Agent\", \"summary\": \"Since human and environmental factors interfere, captured polyp images\\nusually suffer from issues such as dim lighting, blur, and overexposure, which\\npose challenges for downstream polyp segmentation tasks. To address the\\nchallenges of noise-induced degradation in polyp images, we present AgentPolyp,\\na novel framework integrating CLIP-based semantic guidance and dynamic image\\nenhancement with a lightweight neural network for segmentation. The agent first\\nevaluates image quality using CLIP-driven semantic analysis (e.g., identifying\\n``low-contrast polyps with vascular textures\\\") and adapts reinforcement\\nlearning strategies to dynamically apply multi-modal enhancement operations\\n(e.g., denoising, contrast adjustment). A quality assessment feedback loop\\noptimizes pixel-level enhancement and segmentation focus in a collaborative\\nmanner, ensuring robust preprocessing before neural network segmentation. This\\nmodular architecture supports plug-and-play extensions for various enhancement\\nalgorithms and segmentation networks, meeting deployment requirements for\\nendoscopic devices.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T08:39:35Z\"}"}
