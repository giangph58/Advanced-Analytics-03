Introducing basis functions with\\ncolor-singlet mesonic clusters, integral equations are established for the\\nGreen's functions and the related scattering amplitudes involved in the sectors\\nof the direct and quark-exchange channels. The problem of infrared divergences\\nis dealt with a systematic use of an infrared regulator cutoff introduced in\\nthe gluon propagator. It is shown that the on-mass shell scattering amplitudes\\nare free of infrared divergences up to order $1/N_c^2$. In the limit of\\nvanishing of the infrared cutoff, they can be represented by effective\\nfour-meson contact-type interaction terms with unitarity loops, calculable in\\nterms of the meson wave functions and propagators. The results, obtained at\\norder $1/N_c^2$, are summed with the constraint of unitarization. The\\nunitarized scattering amplitudes are continued in the total mass-squared\\nvariable below the two-meson thresholds, leading to a tetraquark bound state\\nequation, which generally has one solution. Spectroscopic applications of the\\nabove results are sketched and discussed.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:06:42Z\"}"}
