However, their implementation in\\nspecialized, high-stakes domains such as hazardous materials transportation is\\nchallenging due to accuracy and reliability concerns. This study evaluates the\\nperformance of three fine-tuned generative models, ChatGPT, Google's Vertex AI,\\nand ORNL Retrieval Augmented Generation augmented LLaMA 2 and LLaMA in\\nretrieving regulatory information essential for hazardous material\\ntransportation compliance in the United States. Utilizing approximately 40\\npublicly available federal and state regulatory documents, we developed 100\\nrealistic queries relevant to route planning and permitting requirements.\\nResponses were qualitatively rated based on accuracy, detail, and relevance,\\ncomplemented by quantitative assessments of semantic similarity between model\\noutputs. Results demonstrated that the RAG-augmented LLaMA models significantly\\noutperformed Vertex AI and ChatGPT, providing more detailed and generally\\naccurate information, despite occasional inconsistencies. This research\\nintroduces the first known application of RAG in transportation safety,\\nemphasizing the need for domain-specific fine-tuning and rigorous evaluation\\nmethodologies to ensure reliability and minimize the risk of inaccuracies in\\nhigh-stakes environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T16:37:03Z\"}"}
