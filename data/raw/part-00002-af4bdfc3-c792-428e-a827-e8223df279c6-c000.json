{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17294v1\", \"title\": \"Higher-Spin Currents and Flows in Auxiliary Field Sigma Models\", \"summary\": \"We study local, higher-spin conserved currents in integrable $2d$ sigma\\nmodels that have been deformed via coupling to auxiliary fields. These currents\\ngenerate integrability-preserving flows introduced by Smirnov and\\nZamolodchikov. For auxiliary field (AF) deformations of a free boson, we prove\\nthat local spin-$n$ currents exist for all $n$ and give recursion relations\\nthat characterize Smirnov-Zamolodchikov (SZ) flows driven by these currents. We\\nthen show how to construct spin-$2n$ currents in a unified class of auxiliary\\nfield sigma models with common structure -- including AF theories based on the\\nprincipal chiral model (PCM), its non-Abelian T-dual, (bi-)Yang-Baxter\\ndeformations of the PCM, and symmetric space models -- for interaction\\nfunctions of one variable, and describe SZ flows driven by any function of the\\nstress tensor in these cases. Finally, we give perturbative solutions for\\nspin-$3$ SZ flows in any member of our unified class of AF models with\\nunderlying $\\\\mathfrak{su}(3)$ algebra. Part of our analysis shows that the\\nclass of AF deformations can be extended by allowing the interaction function\\nto depend on a larger set of variables than has previously been considered.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,math-ph,math.MP,nlin.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T06:42:51Z\"}"}
