{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20027v1\", \"title\": \"All-Subsets Important Separators with Applications to Sample Sets,\\n  Balanced Separators and Vertex Sparsifiers in Directed Graphs\", \"summary\": \"Given a directed graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, a parameter $k$\\nand two disjoint subsets $S,T \\\\subseteq V(G)$, we show that the number of\\nall-subsets important separators, which is the number of $A$-$B$ important\\nvertex separators of size at most $k$ over all $A \\\\subseteq S$ and $B \\\\subseteq\\nT$, is at most $\\\\beta(|S|, |T|, k) = 4^k {|S| \\\\choose \\\\leq k} {|T| \\\\choose \\\\leq\\n2k}$, where ${x \\\\choose \\\\leq c} = \\\\sum_{i = 1}^c {x \\\\choose i}$, and that they\\ncan be enumerated in time $O(\\\\beta(|S|,|T|,k)k^2(m+n))$. This is a\\ngeneralization of the folklore result stating that the number of $A$-$B$\\nimportant separators for two fixed sets $A$ and $B$ is at most $4^k$ (first\\nimplicitly shown by Chen, Liu and Lu Algorithmica '09). From this result, we\\nobtain the following applications: We give a construction for detection sets\\nand sample sets in directed graphs, generalizing the results of Kleinberg\\n(Internet Mathematics' 03) and Feige and Mahdian (STOC' 06) to directed graphs.\\nVia our new sample sets, we give the first FPT algorithm for finding balanced\\nseparators in directed graphs parameterized by $k$, the size of the separator.\\nOur algorithm runs in time $2^{O(k)} (m + n)$. We also give a $O({\\\\sqrt{\\\\log\\nk}})$ approximation algorithm for the same problem. Finally, we present new\\nresults on vertex sparsifiers for preserving small cuts.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:50:23Z\"}"}
