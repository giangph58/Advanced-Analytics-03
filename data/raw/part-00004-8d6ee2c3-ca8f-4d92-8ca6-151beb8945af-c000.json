For the design\\nand optimization of such systems, measurement-based investigations of\\nreal-world distributed MIMO channels are essential. In this paper, we present\\nan indoor channel measurement campaign, featuring eight distributed antenna\\narrays with 128 elements in total. Multi-link channels are measured at 50\\npositions along a 12-meter user route. A clustering algorithm enabled by\\ninteracting objects is proposed to identify clusters in the measured channels.\\nThe algorithm jointly clusters the multipath components for all links,\\neffectively capturing the dynamic contributions of common clusters to different\\nlinks. In addition, a Kalman filter-based tracking framework is introduced for\\ncluster prediction, tracking, and updating along the user movement. Using the\\nclustering and tracking results, cluster-level characterization of the measured\\nchannels is performed. First, the number of clusters and their visibility at\\nboth link ends are analyzed. Next, a maximum-likelihood estimator is utilized\\nto determine the entire cluster visibility region length. Finally, key\\ncluster-level properties, including the common cluster ratio, cluster power,\\nshadowing, spread, among others, are statistically investigated. The results\\nprovide valuable insights into cluster behavior in typical multi-link channels,\\nnecessary for accurate modeling of distributed MIMO channels.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T16:13:33Z\"}"}
