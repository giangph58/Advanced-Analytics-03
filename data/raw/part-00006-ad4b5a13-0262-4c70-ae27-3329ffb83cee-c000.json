{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10984v1\", \"title\": \"Seeing like a Cephalopod: Colour Vision with a Monochrome Event Camera\", \"summary\": \"Cephalopods exhibit unique colour discrimination capabilities despite having\\none type of photoreceptor, relying instead on chromatic aberration induced by\\ntheir ocular optics and pupil shapes to perceive spectral information. We took\\ninspiration from this biological mechanism to design a spectral imaging system\\nthat combines a ball lens with an event-based camera. Our approach relies on a\\nmotorised system that shifts the focal position, mirroring the adaptive lens\\nmotion in cephalopods. This approach has enabled us to achieve\\nwavelength-dependent focusing across the visible light and near-infrared\\nspectrum, making the event a spectral sensor. We characterise chromatic\\naberration effects, using both event-based and conventional frame-based\\nsensors, validating the effectiveness of bio-inspired spectral discrimination\\nboth in simulation and in a real setup as well as assessing the spectral\\ndiscrimination performance. Our proposed approach provides a robust spectral\\nsensing capability without conventional colour filters or computational\\ndemosaicing. This approach opens new pathways toward new spectral sensing\\nsystems inspired by nature's evolutionary solutions.
