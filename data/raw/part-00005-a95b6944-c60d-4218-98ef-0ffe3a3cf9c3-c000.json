Closed-form expressions for the Cram\\\\'{e}r-Rao lower bound and\\nthe positioning error bound (PEB) in multi-target position estimation are\\nderived, providing quantitative evaluations of sensing performance. To enhance\\nthe overall performance of the ISAC system, a power allocation algorithm is\\ndeveloped to maximize the minimum user communication\\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio while ensuring a specified sensing PEB\\nrequirement. The results validate the proposed PEB expression and its\\napproximation, clearly illustrating the coordination gain enabled by ISAC.\\nFurther, the superiority of using the multi-static CF mMIMO architecture over\\ntraditional cellular ISAC is demonstrated, and the advantages of OTFS signals\\nin high-mobility scenarios are highlighted.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,eess.SP,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T11:48:15Z\"}"}
