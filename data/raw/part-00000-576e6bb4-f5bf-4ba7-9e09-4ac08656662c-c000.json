We theoretically and computationally investigate the\\nbehavior of model protocells -- flexible quasispherical vesicles -- that\\nexchange membrane constituents, internal volume, and heat with an external\\nreservoir. The excess chemical potential and osmotic pressure difference\\nimposed by the reservoir act as generalized thermodynamic driving forces that\\nmodulate vesicle morphology. We identify an associated nonequilibrium\\nmorphological transition between a weakly driven regime, in which growing\\nvesicles remain quasispherical, and a strongly driven regime, in which vesicles\\naccommodate rapid membrane uptake by developing surface wrinkles. This\\ntransition emerges due to the renormalization of membrane mechanical properties\\nby nonequilibrium driving. Further, using insights from stochastic\\nthermodynamics we propose a minimal vesicle growth-shape law that remains\\nrobust even in strongly driven, far-from-equilibrium regimes.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,physics.bio-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:08:15Z\"}"}
