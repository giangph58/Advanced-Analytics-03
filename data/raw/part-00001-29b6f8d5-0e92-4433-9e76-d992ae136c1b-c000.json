{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16784v1\", \"title\": \"Particles in finite volumes and a toy model of decaying neutrons\", \"summary\": \"It is well-known that the momentum spectra of particles confined to finite\\nspatial volumes deviate from the continuous spectra used for unconfined\\nparticles. In this article, we consider real scalar particles confined to\\nfinite volumes with periodic boundary conditions, such that the particles'\\nspectra are discrete. We directly compute the density matrices describing the\\ndecay processes $\\\\phi \\\\to \\\\varphi^2$ and $\\\\phi \\\\to \\\\varphi\\\\chi\\\\nu$, and\\nsubsequently derive expressions for the decay probabilities both for confined\\nand unconfined particles. The latter decay process is used as a rough toy model\\nfor a neutron decaying into a proton, an electron, and an anti-electron\\nneutrino. We propose that finite volume effects can have an impact on the\\noutcomes of experiments measuring the neutron lifetime. In addition, our\\nfindings at the toy model level suggest that taking into account possible\\ninitial correlations between neutrons and their daughter particles might be\\nrelevant as well.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-th,nucl-ex,nucl-th,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:01:40Z\"}"}
