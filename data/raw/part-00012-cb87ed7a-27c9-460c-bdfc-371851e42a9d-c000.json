{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07620v1\", \"title\": \"Equivariant recollements and singular equivalences\", \"summary\": \"In this paper we investigate equivariant recollements of abelian (resp.\\ntriangulated) categories. We first characterize when a recollement of abelian\\n(resp. triangulated) categories induces an equivariant recollement, i.e. a\\nrecollement between the corresponding equivariant abelian (resp. triangulated)\\ncategories. We further investigate singular equivalences in the context of\\nequivariant abelian recollements. In particular, we characterize when a\\nsingular equivalence induced by the quotient functor in an abelian recollement\\nlift to a singular equivalence induced by the equivariant quotient functor. As\\napplications of our results: (i) we construct equivariant recollements for the\\nderived category of a quasi-compact, quasi-separated scheme where the action is\\ncoming from a subgroup of the automorphism group of the scheme and (ii) we\\nderive new singular equivalences between certain skew group algebras.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RT\", \"categories\": \"math.RT,math.AG,math.CT,math.RA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T10:08:23Z\"}"}
