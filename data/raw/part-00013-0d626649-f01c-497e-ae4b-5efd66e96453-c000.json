We experimentally realize two 1-D\\nlattices supporting symmetry-protected topology - the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger\\n(SSH) and extended SSH models using the synthetic frequency dimension of\\ncoupled fiber ring resonators. We introduce and experimentally demonstrate\\ncascaded heterodyning as a technique for low-noise, single-shot winding number\\nmeasurements through the mean chiral displacement and band structure\\nmeasurements. Through our robust setup and detection techniques we can extend\\nour capability to realizing 1-D ladder models, demonstrating a modified Creutz\\nladder with a staggered flux with each plaquette. This highly reconfigurable\\nand compact fiber optics platform for Hamiltonian simulation, along with a\\nlow-noise detection scheme, provides a path forward for chip-scale\\nrealizations.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T06:02:27Z\"}"}
