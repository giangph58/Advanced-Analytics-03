{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23973v1\", \"title\": \"Odd Cuts in Bipartite Grafts II: Structure and Universality of Decapital\\n  Distance Components\", \"summary\": \"This paper is the second in a series of papers characterizing the maximum\\npacking of \\\\( T \\\\)-cuts in bipartite grafts, following the first paper\\n(N.~Kita, ``Tight cuts in bipartite grafts~I: Capital distance components,''\\n{arXiv:2202.00192v2}, 2022). Given a graft $(G, T)$, a minimum join $F$, and a\\nspecified vertex $r$ called the root, the distance components of $(G, T)$ are\\ndefined as subgraphs of $G$ determined by the distances induced by $F$. A\\ndistance component is called {\\\\em capital} if it contains the root; otherwise,\\nit is called {\\\\em decapital}. In our first paper, we investigated the canonical\\nstructure of capital distance components in bipartite grafts, which can be\\ndescribed using the graft analogue of the Kotzig--Lov\\\\'asz decomposition. In\\nthis paper, we provide the counterpart structure for the decapital distance\\ncomponents. We also establish a necessary and sufficient condition for two\\nvertices $r$ and $r'$ under which a decapital distance component with respect\\nto root $r$ is also a decapital distance component with respect to root $r'$.\\nAs a consequence, we obtain that the total number of decapital distance\\ncomponents in a bipartite graft, taken over all choices of root, is equal to\\ntwice the number of edges in a minimum join of the graft.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T11:36:02Z\"}"}
