While Deep\\nReinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown promise, existing methods often assume\\nusers' opinions are binary and ignore their behavior and prior knowledge. We\\npropose DRIM, a multi-dimensional uncertainty-aware DRL-based CIM framework\\nthat leverages Subjective Logic (SL) to model uncertainty in user opinions,\\npreferences, and DRL decision-making. DRIM introduces an Uncertainty-based\\nOpinion Model (UOM) for a more realistic representation of user uncertainty and\\noptimizes seed selection for propagating true information while countering\\nfalse information. In addition, it quantifies uncertainty in balancing\\nexploration and exploitation. Results show that UOM significantly enhances true\\ninformation spread and maintains influence against advanced false information\\nstrategies. DRIM-based CIM schemes outperform state-of-the-art methods by up to\\n57% and 88% in influence while being up to 48% and 77% faster. Sensitivity\\nanalysis indicates that higher network observability and greater information\\npropagation boost performance, while high network activity mitigates the effect\\nof users' initial biases.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SI\", \"categories\": \"cs.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T14:26:04Z\"}"}
