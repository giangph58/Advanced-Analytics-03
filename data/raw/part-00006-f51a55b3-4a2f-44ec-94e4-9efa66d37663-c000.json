We evaluate various caching\\nstrategies including Least Recently Used (LRU), Least Frequently Used (LFU),\\nAdaptive Replacement Cache (ARC), and Time-Aware Least Recently Used (TLRU)\\nagainst metrics such as hit ratio, latency reduction, memory overhead, and\\nscalability. Our analysis reveals that while traditional algorithms like LRU\\nremain prevalent, hybrid approaches incorporating machine learning techniques\\ndemonstrate superior performance in dynamic environments. Additionally, we\\nanalyze implementation patterns across different distributed architectures and\\nprovide recommendations for algorithm selection based on specific workload\\ncharacteristics.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T02:24:21Z\"}"}
