Specifically, we investigate\\nthe applicability of the price and choose mechanism proposed by Echenique and\\nN\\\\'u\\\\~nez(2025) to risk allocation problems. While their mechanism implements\\nPareto optimal allocations in finite choice sets, we consider extending it to\\nan infinite choice set of feasible risk-sharing allocations. This paper asks\\nwhether an ex-ante welfare-maximising risk allocation rule can indeed be\\nimplemented for a large group. Specifically, we study the price and choose\\n(P&C) mechanism of Echenique and N\\\\'u\\\\~nez(2025) in a risk-sharing setting. In\\nP&C, players sequentially set prices for each possible alternative; the last\\nplayer chooses an alternative, provided that all previous players receive the\\nprices they set. Echenique and N\\\\'u\\\\~nez(2025) show that, for finite choice\\nsets, the mechanism implements any Pareto optimal allocation in the\\nsubgame-perfect Nash equilibrium. Our setting differs in one crucial respect:\\nthe choice set is infinite. Each alternative is a feasible allocation of total\\nrisk, and each player sets a Lipschitz-continuous price function on this\\ninfinite set. We show that the P&C mechanism can still be extended to implement\\nthe allocation that maximises the sum of players' utilities, even with an\\ninfinite choice set.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.TH\", \"categories\": \"econ.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T04:35:08Z\"}"}
