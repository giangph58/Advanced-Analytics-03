Given a target coverage parameter $\\\\delta$,\\nand sample access to an arbitrary distribution $D$, we want to output a\\nconfidence set $S \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^d$ such that $S$ achieves $\\\\delta$\\ncoverage of $D$, i.e., $\\\\mathbb{P}_{y \\\\sim D} \\\\left[ y \\\\in S \\\\right] \\\\ge\\n\\\\delta$, and the volume of $S$ is as small as possible. This is a central\\nproblem in high-dimensional statistics with applications in finding confidence\\nsets, uncertainty quantification, and support estimation.\\n  In the most general setting, this problem is statistically intractable, so we\\nrestrict our attention to competing with sets from a concept class $C$ with\\nbounded VC-dimension. An algorithm is competitive with class $C$ if, given\\nsamples from an arbitrary distribution $D$, it outputs in polynomial time a set\\nthat achieves $\\\\delta$ coverage of $D$, and whose volume is competitive with\\nthe smallest set in $C$ with the required coverage $\\\\delta$. This problem is\\ncomputationally challenging even in the basic setting when $C$ is the set of\\nall Euclidean balls. Existing algorithms based on coresets find in polynomial\\ntime a ball whose volume is $\\\\exp(\\\\tilde{O}( d/ \\\\log d))$-factor competitive\\nwith the volume of the best ball.\\n  Our main result is an algorithm that finds a confidence set whose volume is\\n$\\\\exp(\\\\tilde{O}(d^{2/3}))$ factor competitive with the optimal ball having the\\ndesired coverage. The algorithm is improper (it outputs an ellipsoid). Combined\\nwith our computational intractability result for proper learning balls within\\nan $\\\\exp(\\\\tilde{O}(d^{1-o(1)}))$ approximation factor in volume, our results\\nprovide an interesting separation between proper and (improper) learning of\\nconfidence sets.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS,cs.LG,math.ST,stat.ML,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T16:05:10Z\"}"}
