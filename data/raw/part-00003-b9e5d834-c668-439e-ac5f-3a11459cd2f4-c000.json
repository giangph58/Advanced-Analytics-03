However, there is a gap in the\\nproof of this result in the existing literature. The existing definition of\\nrelative universality seems to be too strong for the proof to be valid. In this\\nnote we modify the definition of relative universality using the concept of\\n\\\\k{o}-measurability, and rigorously establish the mentioned unbiasedness and\\nFisher consistency. The significance of this result is beyond its original\\ncontext of sufficient dimension reduction, because relative universality allows\\nus to use the regression operator to fully characterize conditional\\nindependence, a crucially important statistical relation that sits at the core\\nof many areas and methodologies in statistics and machine learning, such as\\ndimension reduction, graphical models, probability embedding, causal inference,\\nand Bayesian estimation.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.ME,stat.ML,stat.TH,G.3\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T10:12:26Z\"}"}
