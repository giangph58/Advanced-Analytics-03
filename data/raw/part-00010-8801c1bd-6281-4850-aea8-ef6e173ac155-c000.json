{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12612v1\", \"title\": \"The Chronicles of Foundation AI for Forensics of Multi-Agent Provenance\", \"summary\": \"Provenance is the chronology of things, resonating with the fundamental\\npursuit to uncover origins, trace connections, and situate entities within the\\nflow of space and time. As artificial intelligence advances towards autonomous\\nagents capable of interactive collaboration on complex tasks, the provenance of\\ngenerated content becomes entangled in the interplay of collective creation,\\nwhere contributions are continuously revised, extended or overwritten. In a\\nmulti-agent generative chain, content undergoes successive transformations,\\noften leaving little, if any, trace of prior contributions. In this study, we\\ninvestigates the problem of tracking multi-agent provenance across the temporal\\ndimension of generation. We propose a chronological system for post hoc\\nattribution of generative history from content alone, without reliance on\\ninternal memory states or external meta-information. At its core lies the\\nnotion of symbolic chronicles, representing signed and time-stamped records, in\\na form analogous to the chain of custody in forensic science. The system\\noperates through a feedback loop, whereby each generative timestep updates the\\nchronicle of prior interactions and synchronises it with the synthetic content\\nin the very act of generation. This research seeks to develop an accountable\\nform of collaborative artificial intelligence within evolving cyber ecosystems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.CR,cs.MA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T03:23:17Z\"}"}
