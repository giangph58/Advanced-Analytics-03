The general solution to this equation is expressed\\nin terms of an auxiliary field, $\\\\tau$, and Courant-Hilbert functions,\\n$\\\\ell(\\\\tau)$, which depend on $\\\\tau$. Recent studies have shown that\\nduality-invariant nonlinear electromagnetic theories fulfill the principle of\\ncausality under the conditions $\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\ell}{\\\\partial \\\\tau} \\\\ge 1$ and\\n$\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\ell}{\\\\partial \\\\tau^2} \\\\ge 0$.\\n  In this paper, we investigate theories with two coupling constants that also\\ncomply with the principle of causality. We demonstrate that these theories\\npossess a new universal representation of the root-$T\\\\bar{T}$ operator.\\nAdditionally, we derive marginal and irrelevant flow equations for the\\nlogarithmic causal self-dual electrodynamics and identify a symmetry referred\\nto as $\\\\alpha$-symmetry, which is present in all these models.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:08:34Z\"}"}
