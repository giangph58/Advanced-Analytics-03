{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03345v1\", \"title\": \"Elevating Cyber Threat Intelligence against Disinformation Campaigns\\n  with LLM-based Concept Extraction and the FakeCTI Dataset\", \"summary\": \"The swift spread of fake news and disinformation campaigns poses a\\nsignificant threat to public trust, political stability, and cybersecurity.\\nTraditional Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) approaches, which rely on low-level\\nindicators such as domain names and social media handles, are easily evaded by\\nadversaries who frequently modify their online infrastructure. To address these\\nlimitations, we introduce a novel CTI framework that focuses on high-level,\\nsemantic indicators derived from recurrent narratives and relationships of\\ndisinformation campaigns. Our approach extracts structured CTI indicators from\\nunstructured disinformation content, capturing key entities and their\\ncontextual dependencies within fake news using Large Language Models (LLMs). We\\nfurther introduce FakeCTI, the first dataset that systematically links fake\\nnews to disinformation campaigns and threat actors. To evaluate the\\neffectiveness of our CTI framework, we analyze multiple fake news attribution\\ntechniques, spanning from traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) to\\nfine-tuned LLMs. This work shifts the focus from low-level artifacts to\\npersistent conceptual structures, establishing a scalable and adaptive approach\\nto tracking and countering disinformation campaigns.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T09:13:32Z\"}"}
