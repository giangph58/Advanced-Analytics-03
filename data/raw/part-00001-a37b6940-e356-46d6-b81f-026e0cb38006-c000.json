These maps turns out to be idempotent and by\\nconstruction they admit birational partial inverses (companion maps) which are\\nYang-Baxter maps. The maps in question can be reinterpreted as systems of\\ndifference equations defined on the edges of the $\\\\mathbb{Z}^2$ graph. Finally,\\nwe associate these compatible systems of difference equations with integrable\\ndifference equations defined on the triangular lattice $Q(A2)$.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.SI\", \"categories\": \"nlin.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T15:59:24Z\"}"}
