{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16013v1\", \"title\": \"Thermal rectification and phonon properties in partially perforated\\n  graphene\", \"summary\": \"In this work, a thermal rectification ratio $\\\\eta$ of 18.5% was observed in\\npartially perforated graphene with the use of Molecular Dynamics (MD)\\nsimulations. In all cases studied here, heat preferentially flows from the\\nporous to the pristine region and both $\\\\kappa$ and $\\\\eta$ increase upon\\nincreasing the length of the pristine region and upon decreasing the size of\\nthe pores. To interpret the results, the macroscopic \\\"R-Series Model\\\" is\\napplied, attributing rectification to the different temperature dependence of\\n$\\\\kappa$ of perforated and pristine graphene. According to the model, $\\\\eta$ is\\nmaximized when the two regions composing the structure have matching thermal\\nresistances and mismatching temperature-dependence of $\\\\kappa$. The model\\nagrees qualitatively with the MD results, indicating that the latter is the\\nprincipal rectification mechanism, but it can significantly underestimate\\n$\\\\eta$. Phonon analysis further reveals the appearance of new 'defect' modes\\nlocalized around and between pores, resulting in the emergence of a new\\nprominent peak in the phonon Density of States at 520 $cm^{-1}$. The study\\nconsiders key geometric factors such as the length of the pristine region, and\\nthe pore size, shape, alignment, and orientation. Pore shape and alignment\\nexert minimal influence on $\\\\eta$, although alignment greatly influences\\n$\\\\kappa$. Eventually, arranged pores are deemed more efficient than randomly\\ndistributed defects for increasing rectification.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T16:25:01Z\"}"}
