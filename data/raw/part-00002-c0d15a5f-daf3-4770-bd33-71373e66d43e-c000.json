This invariant bridge across\\nfour points opens new possibilities for predictive coding, data compression,\\nand error detection. We demonstrate how the relation can be used to reconstruct\\nmissing data, verify data integrity, and reduce redundancy in data streams with\\nminimal computational overhead. The simplicity and universality of this\\ninvariant make it a promising tool for a wide range of applications in\\ninformation theory and coding systems.\", \"main_category\": \"math.LO\", \"categories\": \"math.LO,cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T09:52:25Z\"}"}
