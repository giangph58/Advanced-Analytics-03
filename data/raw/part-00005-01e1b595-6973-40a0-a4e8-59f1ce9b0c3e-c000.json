{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04930v1\", \"title\": \"Ultraviolet Photometry and Reddening Estimation of 105 Galactic Open\\n  Clusters\", \"summary\": \"This paper focuses on observing unstudied Galactic open clusters in the\\nUltraviolet (UV) wavelength range and analyzing their photometric data. The\\nGaia Data Release 3 (DR3) enables us to precisely study known Galactic open\\nclusters. We conducted observations using the 1.54-meter Danish Telescope\\n(DK1.54) in Chile and the 2.15-meter telescope at the Complejo Astron{\\\\'o}mico\\nEl Leoncito (CASLEO) in Argentina, employing UV filters. Furthermore, we have\\ncollected available photometric and astrometric data for our observed clusters.\\nWe aim to estimate the reddening of Galactic open clusters using UV photometry.\\nWe applied isochrone fitting to determine the reddening of the clusters using\\nwell-known members. As a final result, we present the reddening values of 105\\nGalactic open clusters in the UV, as determined by our photometry.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:15:05Z\"}"}
