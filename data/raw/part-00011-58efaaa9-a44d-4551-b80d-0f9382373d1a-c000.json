Beauchard.\\nOur first objective is to revisit this result and establish the controllability\\nin H 1 0 for suitable discontinuous control potentials. In the second part, we\\nconsider the equation in the presence of periodic boundary conditions and a\\nconstant magnetic field. We prove the local exact controllability of periodic H\\n1 -states, thanks to a Zeeman-type effect induced by the magnetic field which\\ndecouples the resonant spectrum. Finally, we discuss open problems and partial\\nresults for the Neumann case and the harmonic oscillator.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T12:00:07Z\"}"}
