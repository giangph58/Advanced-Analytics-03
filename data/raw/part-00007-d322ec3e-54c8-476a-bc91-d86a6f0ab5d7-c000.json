However, dealing with complex and dynamic web environments\\nrequires more advanced planning and search abilities. Previous studies usually\\nadopt a greedy one-way search strategy, which may struggle to recover from\\nerroneous states. In this work, we enhance web agents with an explicit rollback\\nmechanism, enabling the agent to revert back to a previous state in its\\nnavigation trajectory. This mechanism gives the model the flexibility to\\ndirectly control the search process, leading to an effective and efficient web\\nnavigation method. We conduct experiments on two live web navigation benchmarks\\nwith zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. The results demonstrate the\\neffectiveness of our proposed approach.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T05:41:20Z\"}"}
