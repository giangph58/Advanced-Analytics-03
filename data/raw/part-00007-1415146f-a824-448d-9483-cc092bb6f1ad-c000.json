{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10266v1\", \"title\": \"Vision based driving agent for race car simulation environments\", \"summary\": \"In recent years, autonomous driving has become a popular field of study. As\\ncontrol at tire grip limit is essential during emergency situations, algorithms\\ndeveloped for racecars are useful for road cars too. This paper examines the\\nuse of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to solve the problem of grip limit\\ndriving in a simulated environment. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) method\\nis used to train an agent to control the steering wheel and pedals of the\\nvehicle, using only visual inputs to achieve professional human lap times. The\\npaper outlines the formulation of the task of time optimal driving on a race\\ntrack as a deep reinforcement learning problem, and explains the chosen\\nobservations, actions, and reward functions. The results demonstrate human-like\\nlearning and driving behavior that utilize maximum tire grip potential.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T14:29:37Z\"}"}
