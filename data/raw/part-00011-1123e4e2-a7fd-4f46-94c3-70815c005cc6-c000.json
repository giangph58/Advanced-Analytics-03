Key signatures-including a fully spin/valley polarized\\nnormal state, anomalous Hall resistivity hysteresis, superconducting phase\\nadjacent to the fractional Chern insulating state and a narrow superconducting\\ndome at zero gating field-collectively indicate chiral superconductivity driven\\nby intravalley pairing of electrons. Within the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism, we\\ncompute the superconducting phase diagram via random phase approximation,\\nincorporating Coulomb repulsion in a realistic continuum model. Our results\\nidentify a dominant intravalley pairing with a narrow superconducting dome of\\np+ip type at zero gate field. This chiral phase contrasts sharply with the much\\nweaker time-reversal-symmetric intervalley pairing at finite gating field. Our\\nwork highlights the role of band topology in achieving robust topological\\nsuperconductivity, and supports the chiral and topological nature of the\\nsuperconductivity observed in twisted MoTe2.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T17:55:18Z\"}"}
