We have obtained the bound on the model parameter n graphically and\\nachieved the stable stellar structure of the mathematical model of a compact\\nobject. The stability of the generated model is examined by the\\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation and the Harrison-Zeldovich-Novikov\\ncriterion. This anisotropic compact star model fulfills all the required\\nstability criteria including the causality condition, adiabatic index, and\\nBuchdahl condition, Herrera's cracking condition and pertains free from central\\nsingularities.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T06:38:20Z\"}"}
