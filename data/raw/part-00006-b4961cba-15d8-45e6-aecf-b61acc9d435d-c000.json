The\\neffective two-dimensional model comprises a classical elastic bending energy\\nand surface terms which reflect the possibility that voids can persist in the\\nlimit, that the limiting plate can be broken apart into several pieces, or that\\nthe plate can be folded. Building upon and extending the techniques used in the\\nauthors' recent work on the derivation of one-dimensional theories for thin\\nbrittle rods with voids, the present contribution generalizes the results of\\nSantili and Schmidt (2022), by considering general geometries on the admissible\\nset of voids and constructing recovery sequences for all admissible limiting\\nconfigurations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:19:37Z\"}"}
