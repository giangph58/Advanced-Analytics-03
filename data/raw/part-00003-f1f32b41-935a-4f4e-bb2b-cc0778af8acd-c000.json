The group is known to have a canonical simply\\ntransitive action on spanning trees if the graph is embedded into the plane.\\nHowever, no canonical action on the spanning trees is known for the nonplanar\\ncase. We show that for any embedded Eulerian digraph, one can define a\\ncanonical simply transitive action of the sandpile group on compatible Eulerian\\ntours (a set whose cardinality equals to the number of spanning arborescences).\\nThis enables us to give a new proof that the rotor-routing action of a ribbon\\ngraph is independent of the root if and only if the embedding is into the plane\\n(originally proved by Chan, Church and Grochow).\\n  Recently, Merino, Moffatt and Noble defined a sandpile group variant (called\\nJacobian) for embedded graphs, whose cardinality is the number of quasi-trees.\\nBaker, Ding and Kim showed that this group acts canonically on the quasitrees.\\nWe show that the Jacobian of an embedded graph is canonically isomorphic to the\\nusual sandpile group of the medial digraph, and the action by Baker at al.\\nagrees with the action of the sandpile group of the medial digraph on Eulerian\\ntours (which fact is made possible by the existence of a canonical bijection\\nbetween Eulerian tours of the medial digraph and quasi-trees due to Bouchet).\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T17:15:37Z\"}"}
