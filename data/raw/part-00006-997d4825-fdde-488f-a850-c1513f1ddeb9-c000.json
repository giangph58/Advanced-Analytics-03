In contrast, dephasing and\\ndecoherence, commonly present in out-of-equilibrium systems, are widely\\nrecognized to suppress wave interference and thus destroy Anderson\\nlocalization. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that dephasing can instead\\ninduce localization in non-Hermitian quasicrystals, where the eigenstates would\\notherwise remain delocalized under coherent dynamics. Specifically, the\\ndephasing in our system is realized through uncorrelated spacetime disorder; we\\nthus term the observed phenomenon \\\"spacetime-disorder-induced localization.\\\"\\nOur experiments are performed in optical synthetic quasicrystals featuring an\\nincommensurate imaginary potential and a real potential subjected to spacetime\\ndisorder. Also, surprisingly, unlike Hermitian quasicrystals where the\\nspacetime disorder obliterates Anderson metal-insulator transition, our\\nnon-Hermitian quasicrystals exhibit an exceptionally robust transition against\\nthe spacetime disorder. Our experiments challenge the conventional\\nunderstanding of Anderson localization and open avenues for exploring the\\nunusual interplay between non-Hermiticity, spacetime disorder, and phase\\ntransition in quasicrystals.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T07:57:51Z\"}"}
