For this, they interact with resource managers which\\nschedule workflow tasks onto cluster nodes. In addition to workflow task\\ndescriptions, resource managers rely on task performance estimates such as main\\nmemory consumption and runtime to efficiently manage cluster resources. Such\\nperformance estimates should be automated, as user-based task performance\\nestimates are error-prone.\\n  In this book chapter, we describe key characteristics of methods for workflow\\ntask runtime and memory prediction, provide an overview and a detailed\\ncomparison of state-of-the-art methods from the literature, and discuss how\\nworkflow task performance prediction is useful for scheduling, energy-efficient\\nand carbon-aware computing, and cost prediction.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T15:42:14Z\"}"}
