In\\nthis work, we focus on the concept of macroscopic states, i.e. coarse\\nrepresentations of microscopic details, defined as states that can be inferred\\nsolely from the outcomes of macroscopic measurements. Building on the theories\\nof quantum statistical sufficiency and quantum Bayesian retrodiction, we\\ncharacterize macroscopic states through several equivalent formulations,\\nranging from algebraic to explicitly constructive. We introduce a hierarchy of\\nmacroscopicity-non-decreasing operations and develop a resource theory of\\nmicroscopicity that unifies and generalizes existing resource theories of\\ncoherence, athermality, purity, and asymmetry. Finally, we introduce the\\nconcept of inferential reference frames and reinterpret macroscopic entropy as\\na measure of inferential asymmetry, i.e., irretrodictability.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.stat-mech,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T08:28:09Z\"}"}
