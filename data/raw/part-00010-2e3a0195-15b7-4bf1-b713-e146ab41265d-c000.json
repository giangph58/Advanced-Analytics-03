We\\npresent a neuroadaptive haptics system that adapts XR feedback through\\nreinforcement learning (RL) from explicit user ratings and brain-decoded neural\\nsignals. In a user study, participants interacted with virtual objects in VR\\nwhile Electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded. An RL agent adjusted\\nhaptic feedback based either on explicit ratings or on outputs from a neural\\ndecoder. Results show that the RL agent's performance was comparable across\\nfeedback sources, suggesting that implicit neural feedback can effectively\\nguide personalization without requiring active user input. The EEG-based neural\\ndecoder achieved a mean F1 score of 0.8, supporting reliable classification of\\nuser experience. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of combining\\nbrain-computer interfaces (BCI) and RL to autonomously adapt XR interactions,\\nreducing cognitive load and enhancing immersion.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T15:34:19Z\"}"}
