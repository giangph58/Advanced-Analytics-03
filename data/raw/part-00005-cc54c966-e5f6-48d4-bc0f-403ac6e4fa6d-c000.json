{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17782v1\", \"title\": \"Unleashing the Power of Natural Audio Featuring Multiple Sound Sources\", \"summary\": \"Universal sound separation aims to extract clean audio tracks corresponding\\nto distinct events from mixed audio, which is critical for artificial auditory\\nperception. However, current methods heavily rely on artificially mixed audio\\nfor training, which limits their ability to generalize to naturally mixed audio\\ncollected in real-world environments. To overcome this limitation, we propose\\nClearSep, an innovative framework that employs a data engine to decompose\\ncomplex naturally mixed audio into multiple independent tracks, thereby\\nallowing effective sound separation in real-world scenarios. We introduce two\\nremix-based evaluation metrics to quantitatively assess separation quality and\\nuse these metrics as thresholds to iteratively apply the data engine alongside\\nmodel training, progressively optimizing separation performance. In addition,\\nwe propose a series of training strategies tailored to these separated\\nindependent tracks to make the best use of them. Extensive experiments\\ndemonstrate that ClearSep achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple\\nsound separation tasks, highlighting its potential for advancing sound\\nseparation in natural audio scenarios.
