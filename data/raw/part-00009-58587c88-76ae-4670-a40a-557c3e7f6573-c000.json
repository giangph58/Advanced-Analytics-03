A few computational models for this problem have been\\npreviously studied. We give a unified approach to this problem in all models\\nvia a reduction to a particular shortest-path problem, and obtain improved\\nrunning times in essentially all cases. In addition, we also give fine-grained\\nlower bounds for many cases.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CG\", \"categories\": \"cs.CG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T06:31:46Z\"}"}
