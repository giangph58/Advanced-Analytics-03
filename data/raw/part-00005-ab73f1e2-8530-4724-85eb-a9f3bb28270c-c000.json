{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07584v1\", \"title\": \"REANIMATOR: Reanimate Retrieval Test Collections with Extracted and\\n  Synthetic Resources\", \"summary\": \"Retrieval test collections are essential for evaluating information retrieval\\nsystems, yet they often lack generalizability across tasks. To overcome this\\nlimitation, we introduce REANIMATOR, a versatile framework designed to enable\\nthe repurposing of existing test collections by enriching them with extracted\\nand synthetic resources. REANIMATOR enhances test collections from PDF files by\\nparsing full texts and machine-readable tables, as well as related contextual\\ninformation. It then employs state-of-the-art large language models to produce\\nsynthetic relevance labels. Including an optional human-in-the-loop step can\\nhelp validate the resources that have been extracted and generated. We\\ndemonstrate its potential with a revitalized version of the TREC-COVID test\\ncollection, showcasing the development of a retrieval-augmented generation\\nsystem and evaluating the impact of tables on retrieval-augmented generation.\\nREANIMATOR enables the reuse of test collections for new applications, lowering\\ncosts and broadening the utility of legacy resources.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T09:25:11Z\"}"}
