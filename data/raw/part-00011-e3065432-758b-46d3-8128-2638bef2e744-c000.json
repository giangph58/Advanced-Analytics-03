In the field-theory limit ($\\\\alpha'\\\\to0$), the\\nstringy form factor reduces to the form factor, helps us to investigate the\\nhidden properties of the field-theory form factors, manifest the factorization\\nand soft behaviors, and uncover more non-trivial relations between form factors\\nand scattering amplitudes.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T08:45:17Z\"}"}
