{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17617v1\", \"title\": \"Decentralized Time Series Classification with ROCKET Features\", \"summary\": \"Time series classification (TSC) is a critical task with applications in\\nvarious domains, including healthcare, finance, and industrial monitoring. Due\\nto privacy concerns and data regulations, Federated Learning has emerged as a\\npromising approach for learning from distributed time series data without\\ncentralizing raw information. However, most FL solutions rely on a\\nclient-server architecture, which introduces robustness and confidentiality\\nrisks related to the distinguished role of the server, which is a single point\\nof failure and can observe knowledge extracted from clients. To address these\\nchallenges, we propose DROCKS, a fully decentralized FL framework for TSC that\\nleverages ROCKET (RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform) features. In DROCKS,\\nthe global model is trained by sequentially traversing a structured path across\\nfederation nodes, where each node refines the model and selects the most\\neffective local kernels before passing them to the successor. Extensive\\nexperiments on the UCR archive demonstrate that DROCKS outperforms\\nstate-of-the-art client-server FL approaches while being more resilient to node\\nfailures and malicious attacks.
