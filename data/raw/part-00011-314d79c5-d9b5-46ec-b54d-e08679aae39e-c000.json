In these objects,\\nwe have a fixed higher-degree form (in particular, a ternary form) instead of a\\nquadratic form in ordinary Clifford algebras. We present a natural realization\\nof unitary Lie groups, which are important in physics and other applications,\\nusing only operations in generalized Clifford algebras and without using the\\ncorresponding matrix representations. Basis-free definitions of the\\ndeterminant, trace, and characteristic polynomial in generalized Clifford\\nalgebras are introduced. Explicit formulas for all coefficients of the\\ncharacteristic polynomial and inverse in generalized Clifford algebras are\\npresented. The operation of Hermitian conjugation (or Hermitian transpose) in\\ngeneralized Clifford algebras is introduced without using the corresponding\\nmatrix representations.\", \"main_category\": \"math-ph\", \"categories\": \"math-ph,math.MP,math.RA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T11:33:43Z\"}"}
