{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15849v1\", \"title\": \"NLCTables: A Dataset for Marrying Natural Language Conditions with Table\\n  Discovery\", \"summary\": \"With the growing abundance of repositories containing tabular data,\\ndiscovering relevant tables for in-depth analysis remains a challenging task.\\nExisting table discovery methods primarily retrieve desired tables based on a\\nquery table or several vague keywords, leaving users to manually filter large\\nresult sets. To address this limitation, we propose a new task: NL-conditional\\ntable discovery (nlcTD), where users combine a query table with natural\\nlanguage (NL) requirements to refine search results. To advance research in\\nthis area, we present nlcTables, a comprehensive benchmark dataset comprising\\n627 diverse queries spanning NL-only, union, join, and fuzzy conditions, 22,080\\ncandidate tables, and 21,200 relevance annotations. Our evaluation of six\\nstate-of-the-art table discovery methods on nlcTables reveals substantial\\nperformance gaps, highlighting the need for advanced techniques to tackle this\\nchallenging nlcTD scenario. The dataset, construction framework, and baseline\\nimplementations are publicly available at\\nhttps://github.com/SuDIS-ZJU/nlcTables to foster future research.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T12:44:59Z\"}"}
