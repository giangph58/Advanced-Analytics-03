We show\\nfor Cohen-Macaulay local rings that derived $(\\\\mathbf{ldep})$ is equivalent to\\n$\\\\dim(R)$ being a uniform Auslander bound for $R$, and if $\\\\dim(R)>0$ that both\\nare equivalent to $(\\\\mathbf{ldep})$. We introduce an analogous condition we\\ncall the \\\\emph{uniform Buchweitz condition} and provide a corresponding theorem\\nfor the $(\\\\mathbf{rdep})$ condition. As a consequence of these results, we show\\n$(\\\\mathbf{ldep})$ implies $(\\\\mathbf{rdep})$ when $R$ is Gorenstein and that the\\n$(\\\\mathbf{ldep})$ and $(\\\\mathbf{rdep})$ conditions behave well under modding\\nout by regular sequences and completion, but we give a concrete example showing\\nthey need not localize. Using our methods, we extend work of Jorgensen by\\ncalculating the value $q_R(M,N):=\\\\sup\\\\{i \\\\mid \\\\operatorname{Tor}^R_i(M,N) \\\\ne\\n0\\\\}$ under certain conditions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AC\", \"categories\": \"math.AC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T10:34:57Z\"}"}
