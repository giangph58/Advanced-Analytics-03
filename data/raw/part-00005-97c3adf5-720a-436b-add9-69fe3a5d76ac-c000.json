We study the universal\\ncovering of this Lorentzian manifold to exclude a priori presence of time-like\\ncycles. We describe the sets attainable by admissible curves and study the\\nquestion of the existence of the longest arcs. Next, we investigate Lorentzian\\ngeodesics for optimality: we find the cut time and the cut locus. As a\\ngeometric application we compute the injectivity radius of the corresponding\\nLorentzian manifold.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T13:22:51Z\"}"}
