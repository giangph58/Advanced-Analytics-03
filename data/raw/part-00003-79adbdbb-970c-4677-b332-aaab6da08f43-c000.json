{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12720v1\", \"title\": \"Malicious Code Detection in Smart Contracts via Opcode Vectorization\", \"summary\": \"With the booming development of blockchain technology, smart contracts have\\nbeen widely used in finance, supply chain, Internet of things and other fields\\nin recent years. However, the security problems of smart contracts become\\nincreasingly prominent. Security events caused by smart contracts occur\\nfrequently, and the existence of malicious codes may lead to the loss of user\\nassets and system crash. In this paper, a simple study is carried out on\\nmalicious code detection of intelligent contracts based on machine learning.\\nThe main research work and achievements are as follows: Feature extraction and\\nvectorization of smart contract are the first step to detect malicious code of\\nsmart contract by using machine learning method, and feature processing has an\\nimportant impact on detection results. In this paper, an opcode vectorization\\nmethod based on smart contract text is adopted. Based on considering the\\nstructural characteristics of contract opcodes, the opcodes are classified and\\nsimplified. Then, N-Gram (N=2) algorithm and TF-IDF algorithm are used to\\nconvert the simplified opcodes into vectors, and then put into the machine\\nlearning model for training. In contrast, N-Gram algorithm and TF-IDF algorithm\\nare directly used to quantify opcodes and put into the machine learning model\\ntraining. Judging which feature extraction method is better according to the\\ntraining results. Finally, the classifier chain is applied to the intelligent\\ncontract malicious code detection.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T07:51:48Z\"}"}
