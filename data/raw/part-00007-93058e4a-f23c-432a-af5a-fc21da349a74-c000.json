{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17575v1\", \"title\": \"A Multi-Agent, Laxity-Based Aggregation Strategy for Cost-Effective\\n  Electric Vehicle Charging and Local Transformer Overload Prevention\", \"summary\": \"The rapid electrification of transportation, driven by stringent\\ndecarbonization targets and supportive policies, poses significant challenges\\nfor distribution system operators (DSOs). When numerous electric vehicles (EVs)\\ncharge concurrently, local transformers risk overloading - a problem that\\ncurrent tariff-based strategies do not adequately address. This paper\\nintroduces an aggregator-based coordination mechanism that shifts EV charging\\nfrom congested to underutilized periods using a rule-based scheduling\\nalgorithm. Unlike conventional methods that depend on complex real-time pricing\\nsignals or optimization-heavy solutions, the aggregator approach uses a simple\\nyet effective \\\"laxity\\\" measure to prioritize charging flexibility. To assess\\ntechnical and economic viability, a multi-agent simulation was developed to\\nreplicate residential user behavior and DSO constraints under the use of a 400\\nkVA low-voltage transformer. The results indicate that overloads are completely\\neliminated with minimal inconvenience to users, whose increased charging costs\\nare offset by the aggregator at an annual total of under DKK 6000 -\\nsignificantly lower than the cost of infrastructure reinforcement. This study\\ncontributes by (i) quantifying the compensation needed to prevent large-scale\\noverloads, (ii) presenting a replicable, computationally feasible, rule-based\\naggregator model for DSOs, and (iii) comparing aggregator solutions to costly\\ntransformer upgrades, underscoring the aggregator's role as a viable tool for\\nfuture distribution systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MA\", \"categories\": \"cs.MA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:04:35Z\"}"}
