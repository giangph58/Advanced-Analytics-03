The architecture exploits the strong,\\nelectrically tunable spin-orbit interactions intrinsic to hole states in Ge,\\nintegrated with high-quality phononic crystal cavities (PnCCs) to enable fully\\nelectrical qubit control and phonon-mediated coupling. Employing a streamlined\\nsimulation framework built upon multiband \\\\(\\\\mathbf{k}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{p}\\\\)\\nmodeling and finite-element methods, we quantify key performance metrics,\\nincluding electrically tunable \\\\( g \\\\)-factors ranging from \\\\(1.3\\\\) to \\\\(2.0\\\\),\\nspin-phonon coupling strengths up to \\\\(6.3\\\\,\\\\mathrm{MHz}\\\\), phononic cavity\\nquality factors exceeding \\\\(10^4\\\\), and phonon-mediated spin relaxation times\\n(\\\\(T_1\\\\)) reaching milliseconds. The proposed architecture concurrently\\nachieves extended spin coherence and rapid gate operations through strategic\\nelectric field modulation and engineered phononic bandgap environments.\\nFurthermore, isotopically enriched high-purity Ge crystals grown in-house at\\nthe University of South Dakota, significantly enhance device coherence by\\nminimizing disorder and hyperfine interactions. This integrated approach,\\nmerging advanced materials engineering, precise spin-orbit coupling, and\\nphononic cavity design, establishes a promising CMOS-compatible pathway toward\\nscalable, high-fidelity quantum computing.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T16:14:30Z\"}"}
