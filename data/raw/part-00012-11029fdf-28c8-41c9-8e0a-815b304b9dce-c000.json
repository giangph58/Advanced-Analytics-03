We\\ngive a description of the geodesics of this metric. We show that this metric is\\nFinsler, and give a formula for its infinitesimal Finsler structure. We then\\ngeneralise this study to the case of convex Euclidean polygons in the Euclidean\\nplane and to surfaces equipped with singular Euclidean structures with an\\nunderlying fixed triangulation. After developing some elements of the theory of\\ncompleteness and completion of asymmetric metrics which is adapted to our\\nsetting, we study the completeness of the metrics we introduce in this paper.\\nThese problems and the results obtained are motivated by Thurston's work\\ndeveloped in his paper Minimal stretch maps between hyperbolic surfaces. We\\nprovide an analogue of Thurston's theory in a Euclidean setting.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GT\", \"categories\": \"math.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T07:45:38Z\"}"}
