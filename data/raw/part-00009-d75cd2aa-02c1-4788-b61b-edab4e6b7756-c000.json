{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19861v1\", \"title\": \"HIPED: Machine Learning Framework for Spherical Tokamak Pedestal\\n  Prediction and Optimization\", \"summary\": \"We introduce a Machine Learning framework, HIPED (HeIght and width Predictor\\nfor Edge Dynamics), for predicting and optimizing pedestal and core performance\\nin spherical tokamak plasmas. Trained on pedestal and core datasets from the\\nthird MAST-U campaign, HIPED provides accurate estimates of pedestal height and\\nwidth. The results reveal notable differences compared with conventional\\naspect-ratio studies; for instance, a simple power-law relation between\\npedestal width and height has very low accuracy. Instead, additional parameters\\nsuch as normalized plasma pressure, elongation, and Greenwald fraction\\nsignificantly improve accuracy. HIPED can also be trained only on `control room\\nparameters' to inform experimentalists of which controllable parameters to\\nadjust for improving core-integrated performance. The framework further\\nincludes a multi-objective optimization scheme that helps guide experimental\\nplanning and optimization. We find Pareto-optimal discharges with respect to\\nvarious features, including distance from edge-localized modes and normalized\\nplasma pressure, track their parameter trajectories over time, and identify the\\ncontrol room parameters required for these Pareto-optimal discharges. This\\nprovides a framework for systematically optimizing core and edge performance\\naccording to different experimental priorities.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:51:55Z\"}"}
