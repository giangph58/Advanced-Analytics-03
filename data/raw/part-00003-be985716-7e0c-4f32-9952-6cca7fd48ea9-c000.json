The Hubbard bands persist down to monolayer,\\nproviding the definitive evidence for the Mottness in Nb$_3$Cl$_8$. While the\\nsize of the Mott gap remains almost constant across all layers, a striking\\nlayer-parity-dependent oscillation emerges in the local density of states\\n(LDOS) between even (n = 2,4,6) and odd layers (n = 1,3,5), which arises from\\nthe dimerization and correlation modulation of the obstructed atomic states,\\nrespectively. Our conclusions are supported by a critical technical advance in\\natomic-scale LDOS mapping for highly insulating systems. This work provides the\\ndefinitive experimental verification of correlation-driven Mott ground states\\nin Nb3Cl8 while establishing a general protocol for investigating the interplay\\nof electronic correlation and interlayer coupling in layered insulators by\\nusing low-temperature STM technique.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T13:28:58Z\"}"}
