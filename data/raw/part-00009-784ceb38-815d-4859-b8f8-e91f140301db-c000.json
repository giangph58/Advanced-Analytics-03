We focus on the feasibility problem:\\ndetermining whether such a path exists. We model the robot as a query-specific\\nrectangular object capable of moving parallel to its sides. The obstacles are\\naxis-aligned, rectangular, and may overlap. Most previous works only consider\\nnondisjoint rectangular objects and point-sized or statically sized robots. Our\\napproach introduces a novel technique leveraging generalized Gabriel graphs and\\nconstructs a data structure to facilitate online queries regarding path\\nfeasibility with varying robot sizes in sublinear time. To efficiently handle\\nfeasibility queries, we propose an online algorithm utilizing sweep line to\\nconstruct a generalized Gabriel graph under the $L_\\\\infty$ norm, capturing key\\ngap constraints between obstacles. We utilize a persistent disjoint-set union\\ndata structure to efficiently determine feasibility queries in\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\log n)$ time and $\\\\mathcal{O}(n)$ total space.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CG\", \"categories\": \"cs.CG,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T04:40:25Z\"}"}
