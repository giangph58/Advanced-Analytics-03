Our study reveals an optimal choice for the\\ncut-off that divides the Bose gas into a low energy coherent region forming a\\nclassical wave and a high energy thermal cloud acting as a reservoir. Moreover,\\nit highlights the relevance of energy damping, the number conserving scattering\\nbetween thermal and coherent atoms. We analyze the equilibrium properties and\\nnear equilibrium relaxation of a homogeneous BEC in one, two and three\\ndimensions at high phase space density, and calculate the autocorrelation\\nfunction and power spectrum of the density and phase fluctuations. Simulations\\nof the full non-linear SPGPE are in close agreement, and extend our arguments\\nbeyond the linear regime. Our work suggests the need for a re-examination of\\ndecay processes in BECs studied under the neglect of energy damping.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T06:16:47Z\"}"}
