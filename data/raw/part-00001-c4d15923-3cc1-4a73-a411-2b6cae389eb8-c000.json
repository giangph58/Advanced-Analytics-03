Rev. A \\\\textbf{88}, 012331 (2013)] derived the lower bound of\\nthe secret key rate for a Bennett-Brassard (BB84) like quantum key distribution\\nprotocol under collective attacks. However, this lower bound does not always\\nassure the generation of the secret key and thus the protocol may have to be\\naborted sometimes. Thus, we modify the Woodhead's lower bound of the secret key\\nrate in such a way that the secret key is always generated in a BB84 like\\nquantum key distribution protocol. Exploiting the obtained modified lower bound\\nof the secret key rate, we analyze two state dependent quantum cloning machines\\nsuch as (i) Wootters-Zurek QCM and (ii) Modified Buzek-Hillery QCM constructed\\nby fixing the cloning machine parameters of Buzek Hillery quantum cloning\\nmachine (QCM), which may be used by the eavesdropper to extract information\\nfrom the intercepted state. We, thereafter, show that it is possible for the\\ncommunicating parties to distill a secret key, even in the presence of an\\neavesdropper. Moreover, we also discuss the effect of the efficiency of the QCM\\non the generation of the secret key for a successful key distribution protocol.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T05:37:11Z\"}"}
