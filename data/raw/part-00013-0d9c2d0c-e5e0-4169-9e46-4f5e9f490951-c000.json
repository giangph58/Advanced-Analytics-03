For noiseless\\nmeasurements, we find that the decoding problem can be reduced to a series of\\nrepetition codes while yielding near-optimal decoding for intermediate code\\nsizes and achieving optimality in the limit of large codes. In the regime of\\nunreliable measurements, the decoder demonstrates fault-tolerant thresholds\\nabove 5% at the cost of decoding a series of independent repetition codes in (1\\n+ 1) dimensions. Such high thresholds, in conjunction with a practical decoder,\\nefficient long-range logical gates, and suitability for planar implementation,\\nposition the parity architecture as a promising candidate for demonstrating\\nquantum advantage on qubit platforms with strong noise bias.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:03:22Z\"}"}
