This realization arises from a\\nspecialized factorization of the structure function within the defining\\nrelations of the quantum toroidal algebra of $\\\\mathfrak{gl}_1$. Utilizing this\\nfree field realization, we further develop intertwining operators for the\\nalgebra of $\\\\mathfrak{gl}_1$.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,math-ph,math.MP,math.QA,math.RT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T12:50:23Z\"}"}
