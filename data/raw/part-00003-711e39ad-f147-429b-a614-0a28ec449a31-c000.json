{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17532v1\", \"title\": \"Permeation and thermal desorption model of hydrogen in steel: a\\n  sensitivity analysis\", \"summary\": \"This work presents a fully physical model of the hydrogen diffusion and\\ntrapping kinetics in metals, integrating permeation and thermal desorption\\nwithin a unified framework. Based on the McNabb and Foster approach, it\\nrequires only binding energy and number density of trap sites. It correctly\\nreproduces the physics of the system and the results of the analytical\\nsolutions of the permeation kinetics. It is also capable of reproducing thermal\\ndesorption spectra with considerable accuracy. The sensitivity analysis has\\nelucidated the relationships among the processing conditions and the parameters\\ncommonly used to characterize permeation and thermal desorption experiments. An\\nequation empirically derived from the simulation results, expressing the\\ndependence of time lag in desorption on specimen thickness, number density of\\noccupied trap sites, and cathodic concentration, is proposed. In summary, the\\nmodel represents a valuable tool in supporting the interpretation and\\nrationalization of experiments also from a quantitative viewpoint.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T13:19:37Z\"}"}
