{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06917v1\", \"title\": \"Data Augmentation for Fake Reviews Detection in Multiple Languages and\\n  Multiple Domains\", \"summary\": \"With the growth of the Internet, buying habits have changed, and customers\\nhave become more dependent on the online opinions of other customers to guide\\ntheir purchases. Identifying fake reviews thus became an important area for\\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) research. However, developing\\nhigh-performance NLP models depends on the availability of large amounts of\\ntraining data, which are often not available for low-resource languages or\\ndomains. In this research, we used large language models to generate datasets\\nto train fake review detectors. Our approach was used to generate fake reviews\\nin different domains (book reviews, restaurant reviews, and hotel reviews) and\\ndifferent languages (English and Chinese). Our results demonstrate that our\\ndata augmentation techniques result in improved performance at fake review\\ndetection for all domains and languages. The accuracy of our fake review\\ndetection model can be improved by 0.3 percentage points on DeRev TEST, 10.9\\npercentage points on Amazon TEST, 8.3 percentage points on Yelp TEST and 7.2\\npercentage points on DianPing TEST using the augmented datasets.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:23:54Z\"}"}
