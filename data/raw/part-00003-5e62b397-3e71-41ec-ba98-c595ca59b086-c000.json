{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17368v1\", \"title\": \"Inverse-Designed Metasurfaces for Wavefront Restoration in Under-Display\\n  Camera Systems\", \"summary\": \"Under-display camera (UDC) systems enable full-screen displays in smartphones\\nby embedding the camera beneath the display panel, eliminating the need for\\nnotches or punch holes. However, the periodic pixel structures of display\\npanels introduce significant optical diffraction effects, leading to imaging\\nartifacts and degraded visual quality. Conventional approaches to mitigate\\nthese distortions, such as deep learning-based image reconstruction, are often\\ncomputationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time applications in consumer\\nelectronics. This work introduces an inverse-designed metasurface for wavefront\\nrestoration, addressing diffraction-induced distortions without relying on\\nexternal software processing. The proposed metasurface effectively suppresses\\nhigher-order diffraction modes caused by the metallic pixel structures,\\nrestores the optical wavefront, and enhances imaging quality across multiple\\nwavelengths. By eliminating the need for software-based post-processing, our\\napproach establishes a scalable, real-time optical solution for diffraction\\nmanagement in UDC systems. This advancement paves the way to achieve\\nsoftware-free real-time image restoration frameworks for many industrial\\napplications.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T08:40:32Z\"}"}
