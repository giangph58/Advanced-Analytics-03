{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15018v1\", \"title\": \"On the consistency of pseudo-potential lattice Boltzmann methods\", \"summary\": \"We derive the partial differential equation (PDE) to which the\\npseudo-potential lattice Boltzmann method (P-LBM) converges under diffusive\\nscaling, providing a rigorous basis for its consistency analysis. By\\nestablishing a direct link between the method's parameters and physical\\nproperties-such as phase densities, interface thickness, and surface tension-we\\ndevelop a framework that enables users to specify fluid properties directly in\\nSI units, eliminating the need for empirical parameter tuning. This allows the\\nsimulation of problems with predefined physical properties, ensuring a direct\\nand physically meaningful parametrization. The proposed approach is implemented\\nin OpenLB, featuring a dedicated unit converter for multiphase problems. To\\nvalidate the method, we perform benchmark tests-including planar interface,\\nstatic droplet, Galilean invariance, and two-phase flow between parallel\\nplates-using R134a as the working fluid, with all properties specified in\\nphysical units. The results demonstrate that the method achieves second-order\\nconvergence to the identified PDE, confirming its numerical consistency. These\\nfindings highlight the robustness and practicality of the P-LBM, paving the way\\nfor accurate and user-friendly simulations of complex multiphase systems with\\nwell-defined physical properties.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T11:04:38Z\"}"}
