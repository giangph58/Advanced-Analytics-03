{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17483v1\", \"title\": \"Global Gauge Symmetry Breaking in the Abelian Higgs Mechanism\", \"summary\": \"This paper aims to resolve the incompatibility between two extant\\ngauge-invariant accounts of the Abelian Higgs mechanism: the first account uses\\nglobal gauge symmetry breaking, and the second eliminates spontaneous symmetry\\nbreaking entirely. We resolve this incompatibility by using the constrained\\nHamiltonian formalism in symplectic geometry. First we argue that, unlike their\\nlocal counterparts, global gauge symmetries are physical. The symmetries that\\nare spontaneously broken by the Higgs mechanism are then the global ones.\\nSecond, we explain how the dressing field method singles out the Coulomb gauge\\nas a preferred gauge for a gauge-invariant account of the Abelian Higgs\\nmechanism. Based on the existence of this group of global gauge symmetries that\\nare physical, we resolve the incompatibility between the two accounts by\\narguing that the correct way to carry out the second method is to eliminate\\nonly the redundant gauge symmetries, i.e. those local gauge symmetries which\\nare not global. We extend our analysis to quantum field theory, where we show\\nthat the Abelian Higgs mechanism can be understood as spontaneous global $U(1)$\\nsymmetry breaking in the $C^*$-algebraic sense.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.hist-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.hist-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T12:21:15Z\"}"}
