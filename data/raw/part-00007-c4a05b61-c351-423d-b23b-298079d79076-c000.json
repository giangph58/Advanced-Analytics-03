{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04391v1\", \"title\": \"Advancements in Solid-State Sodium-Based Batteries: A Comprehensive\\n  Review\", \"summary\": \"This manuscript explores recent advancements in solid-state sodium-based\\nbattery technology, particularly focusing on electrochemical performance and\\nthe challenges associated with developing efficient solid electrolytes. The\\nreplacement of conventional liquid electrolytes with solid-state alternatives\\noffers numerous benefits, including enhanced safety and environmental\\nsustainability, as solid-state systems reduce flammability and harsh chemical\\nhandling. The work emphasizes the importance of structure and interface\\ncharacteristics in solid electrolytes, which play a critical role in ionic\\nconductivity and overall battery performance. Various classes of solid\\nelectrolytes, such as sodium-based anti-perovskites and sulphide electrolytes,\\nare examined, highlighting their unique ionic transport mechanisms and\\nmechanical properties that facilitate stable cycling. The manuscript also\\ndiscusses strategies to enhance interfacial stability between the anode and the\\nsolid electrolyte to mitigate performance degradation during battery operation.\\nFurthermore, advancements in electrode formulations and the integration of\\nnovel materials are considered pivotal in optimizing the charging and\\ndischarging processes, thus improving the energy and power densities of sodium\\nbatteries. The outlook on the future of sodium-based solid-state batteries\\nunderscores their potential to meet emerging energy storage demands while\\nleveraging the abundant availability of sodium compared to lithium. This\\ncomprehensive review aims to provide insights into ongoing research and\\nprospective directions for the commercialization of solid-state sodium-based\\nbatteries, positioning them as viable alternatives in the renewable energy\\nlandscape.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T13:14:24Z\"}"}
