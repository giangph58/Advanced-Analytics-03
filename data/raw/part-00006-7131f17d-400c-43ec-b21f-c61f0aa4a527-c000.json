{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00280v1\", \"title\": \"Shadow and geometric scattering analysis of a new black hole with\\n  magnetic charge\", \"summary\": \"We obtain a newly charged black hole with magnetic charge $q$ and coupling\\nconstant $\\\\mu$ from the Einstein-nonlinear electrodynamics theory inspired by\\nquasi-topological terms. We perform the shadow and geometric scattering\\nanalysis of this black hole. For $\\\\mu=0.01$, we have four solution branches\\nlabelled by $2\\\\pm$, 3, and 4 of the horizon, while there exists a single branch\\nlabelled by 2 for $\\\\mu=0.1$. There is the naked singularity (NS) arisen from\\nthe magnetic charge extension of the photon spheres for the 3 and 4-branches.\\nIn case of $q<1$, shadow radii of the $2$-branch with $\\\\mu$=0.01 and 0.1 are\\nthe same as that of the Reissner-Nordstr\\\\\\\"om black hole, while the 3-NS branch\\nof $q>1$ is constrained by the EHT observation. The geometric scattering\\nanalysis is performed to understand the peculiar forms of the critical impact\\nfactors.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T04:03:07Z\"}"}
