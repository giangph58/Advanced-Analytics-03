All\\nthe given results rely exclusively on the convergence and continuity behaviors\\ninduced synthetically by the distance function itself without any topological\\nimplications. At the end of the paper, we also present two applications; the\\nCaristi fixed point theorem and an existence theorem for equilibrium problems.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T09:28:53Z\"}"}
