Subsurface storage of hydrogen in salt\\ncaverns can play an important role in long-term energy storage, but their\\nglobal potential is not fully understood. This study investigates the global\\nstatus quo and how much hydrogen salt caverns can contribute to stabilizing\\nfuture renewable energy systems. A global geological suitability and land\\neligibility analysis for salt cavern placement is conducted and compared with\\nthe derived long-term storage needs of renewable energy systems. Results show\\nthat hydrogen salt caverns can balance between 43% and 66% of the global\\nelectricity demand and exist in North America, Europe, China, and Australia. By\\nsharing the salt cavern potential with neighboring countries, up to 85% of the\\nglobal electricity demand can be stabilized by salt caverns. Therefore, global\\nhydrogen can play a significant role in stabilizing renewable energy systems.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T14:48:58Z\"}"}
