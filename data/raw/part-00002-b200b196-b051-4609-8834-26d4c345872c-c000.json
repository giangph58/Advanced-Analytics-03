We\\nintroduce the EcoWikiRS dataset, consisting of high-resolution aerial images,\\nthe corresponding geolocated species observations, and, for each species, the\\ntextual descriptions of their habitat from Wikipedia. EcoWikiRS offers a\\nscalable way of supervision for RS vision language models (RS-VLMs) for\\necology. This is a setting with weak and noisy supervision, where, for\\ninstance, some text may describe properties that are specific only to part of\\nthe species' niche or is irrelevant to a specific image. We tackle this by\\nproposing WINCEL, a weighted version of the InfoNCE loss. We evaluate our model\\non the task of ecosystem zero-shot classification by following the habitat\\ndefinitions from the European Nature Information System (EUNIS). Our results\\nshow that our approach helps in understanding RS images in a more ecologically\\nmeaningful manner.
