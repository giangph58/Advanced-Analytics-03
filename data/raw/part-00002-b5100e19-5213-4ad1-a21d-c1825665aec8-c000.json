{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04226v1\", \"title\": \"Defect engineering and effect of vacancy concentration on the\\n  electrochemical performance of V-based MXenes\", \"summary\": \"Vacancies play a pivotal role in determining the physical and chemical\\nproperties of materials. Introducing vacancies into two-dimensional (2D)\\nmaterials offers a promising strategy for developing high-performance electrode\\nmaterials for electrochemical energy storage. Herein, a facile top-down\\nstrategy is employed to create V-based MXenes with tunable vacancy\\nconcentrations, achieved by designing the precursor (V1-xCrx)2AlC (x=0.05, 0.1,\\n0.3) MAX phase and precisely controlling the etching process. Systematic\\ninvestigations reveal that introducing a moderate concentration of Cr-induced\\nvacancies significantly enhances both the capacitance and rate performance of\\nV-based MXenes. Specifically, V1.9CTz achieves a capacitance of 760 F g-1, far\\nexceeding the 420 F g-1 of vacancy-free V2CTz MXene. In contrast, an\\nexcessively high vacancy concentration lead to deteriorated electrochemical\\nperformance and compromised structural stability. This work illustrates that\\ndefect engineering is a powerful approach to tailor the electrochemical\\nproperties of MXenes, offering a framework for designing next-generation\\nMXene-based energy storage systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:25:18Z\"}"}
