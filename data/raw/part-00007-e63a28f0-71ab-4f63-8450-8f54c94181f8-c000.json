{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07603v1\", \"title\": \"RASMD: RGB And SWIR Multispectral Driving Dataset for Robust Perception\\n  in Adverse Conditions\", \"summary\": \"Current autonomous driving algorithms heavily rely on the visible spectrum,\\nwhich is prone to performance degradation in adverse conditions like fog, rain,\\nsnow, glare, and high contrast. Although other spectral bands like\\nnear-infrared (NIR) and long-wave infrared (LWIR) can enhance vision perception\\nin such situations, they have limitations and lack large-scale datasets and\\nbenchmarks. Short-wave infrared (SWIR) imaging offers several advantages over\\nNIR and LWIR. However, no publicly available large-scale datasets currently\\nincorporate SWIR data for autonomous driving. To address this gap, we introduce\\nthe RGB and SWIR Multispectral Driving (RASMD) dataset, which comprises 100,000\\nsynchronized and spatially aligned RGB-SWIR image pairs collected across\\ndiverse locations, lighting, and weather conditions. In addition, we provide a\\nsubset for RGB-SWIR translation and object detection annotations for a subset\\nof challenging traffic scenarios to demonstrate the utility of SWIR imaging\\nthrough experiments on both object detection and RGB-to-SWIR image translation.\\nOur experiments show that combining RGB and SWIR data in an ensemble framework\\nsignificantly improves detection accuracy compared to RGB-only approaches,\\nparticularly in conditions where visible-spectrum sensors struggle. We\\nanticipate that the RASMD dataset will advance research in multispectral\\nimaging for autonomous driving and robust perception systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T09:54:57Z\"}"}
