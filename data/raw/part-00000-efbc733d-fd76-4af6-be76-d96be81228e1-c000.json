These two models predict quite different features\\nfor the accessible SU(3) multiplets in the scalar and axial-vector sectors,\\nwhich can be tested through lattice calculations at SU(3) symmetric points. In\\nthis work, we perform lattice calculations for both scalar and axial-vector\\ncharmed mesons with an SU(3) symmetric pion mass about 613 MeV for the SU(3)\\n$[6]$ and $[\\\\overline{15}]$ multiplets. We find that the $[6]$ multiplet\\nexhibits attractive interactions in both scalar and axial-vector sectors, while\\nthe $[\\\\overline{15}]$ multiplet shows repulsive interactions in both sectors.\\nThe energy shifts in the scalar and axial-vector sectors are compatible with\\neach other within uncertainties. These results are fully consistent with the\\nhadronic molecular picture, while challenging the compact tetraquark model,\\nwhich predicts the existence of low-lying $[\\\\overline{15}]$ states in the\\naxial-vector sector but not in the scalar sector.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-lat\", \"categories\": \"hep-lat,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T11:12:29Z\"}"}
