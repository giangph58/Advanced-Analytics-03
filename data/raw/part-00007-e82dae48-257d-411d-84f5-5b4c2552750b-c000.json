{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00515v1\", \"title\": \"Safety-Critical Traffic Simulation with Guided Latent Diffusion Model\", \"summary\": \"Safety-critical traffic simulation plays a crucial role in evaluating\\nautonomous driving systems under rare and challenging scenarios. However,\\nexisting approaches often generate unrealistic scenarios due to insufficient\\nconsideration of physical plausibility and suffer from low generation\\nefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a guided latent diffusion\\nmodel (LDM) capable of generating physically realistic and adversarial\\nsafety-critical traffic scenarios. Specifically, our model employs a\\ngraph-based variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn a compact latent space that\\ncaptures complex multi-agent interactions while improving computational\\nefficiency. Within this latent space, the diffusion model performs the\\ndenoising process to produce realistic trajectories. To enable controllable and\\nadversarial scenario generation, we introduce novel guidance objectives that\\ndrive the diffusion process toward producing adversarial and behaviorally\\nrealistic driving behaviors. Furthermore, we develop a sample selection module\\nbased on physical feasibility checks to further enhance the physical\\nplausibility of the generated scenarios. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes\\ndataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior adversarial effectiveness\\nand generation efficiency compared to existing baselines while maintaining a\\nhigh level of realism. Our work provides an effective tool for realistic\\nsafety-critical scenario simulation, paving the way for more robust evaluation\\nof autonomous driving systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI,cs.MA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T13:33:34Z\"}"}
