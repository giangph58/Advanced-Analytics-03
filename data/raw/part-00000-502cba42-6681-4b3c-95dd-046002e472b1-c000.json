{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21574v1\", \"title\": \"Generative AI in Financial Institution: A Global Survey of\\n  Opportunities, Threats, and Regulation\", \"summary\": \"Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is rapidly reshaping the global\\nfinancial landscape, offering unprecedented opportunities to enhance customer\\nengagement, automate complex workflows, and extract actionable insights from\\nvast financial data. This survey provides an overview of GenAI adoption across\\nthe financial ecosystem, examining how banks, insurers, asset managers, and\\nfintech startups worldwide are integrating large language models and other\\ngenerative tools into their operations. From AI-powered virtual assistants and\\npersonalized financial advisory to fraud detection and compliance automation,\\nGenAI is driving innovation across functions. However, this transformation\\ncomes with significant cybersecurity and ethical risks. We discuss emerging\\nthreats such as AI-generated phishing, deepfake-enabled fraud, and adversarial\\nattacks on AI systems, as well as concerns around bias, opacity, and data\\nmisuse. The evolving global regulatory landscape is explored in depth,\\nincluding initiatives by major financial regulators and international efforts\\nto develop risk-based AI governance. Finally, we propose best practices for\\nsecure and responsible adoption - including explainability techniques,\\nadversarial testing, auditability, and human oversight. Drawing from academic\\nliterature, industry case studies, and policy frameworks, this chapter offers a\\nperspective on how the financial sector can harness GenAI's transformative\\npotential while navigating the complex risks it introduces.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.CE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T12:25:30Z\"}"}
