{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15805v1\", \"title\": \"No-Regret Model Predictive Control with Online Learning of Koopman\\n  Operators\", \"summary\": \"We study a problem of simultaneous system identification and model predictive\\ncontrol of nonlinear systems. Particularly, we provide an algorithm for systems\\nwith unknown residual dynamics that can be expressed by Koopman operators. Such\\nresidual dynamics can model external disturbances and modeling errors, such as\\nwind and wave disturbances to aerial and marine vehicles, or inaccurate model\\nparameters. The algorithm has finite-time near-optimality guarantees and\\nasymptotically converges to the optimal non-causal controller. Specifically,\\nthe algorithm enjoys sublinear \\\\textit{dynamic regret}, defined herein as the\\nsuboptimality against an optimal clairvoyant controller that knows how the\\nunknown dynamics will adapt to its states and actions. To this end, we assume\\nthe algorithm is given Koopman observable functions such that the unknown\\ndynamics can be approximated by a linear dynamical system. Then, it employs\\nmodel predictive control based on the current learned model of the unknown\\nresidual dynamics. This model is updated online using least squares in a\\nself-supervised manner based on the data collected while controlling the\\nsystem. We validate our algorithm in physics-based simulations of a cart-pole\\nsystem aiming to maintain the pole upright despite inaccurate model parameters.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T11:40:21Z\"}"}
