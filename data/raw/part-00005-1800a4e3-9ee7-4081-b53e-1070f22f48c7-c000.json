Traditionally, this\\ninvolves iterative spin-up computations, where the model runs under constant\\natmospheric settings until steady-state is achieved. These so-called model\\nspin-ups are computationally expensive, often requiring many years of simulated\\ntime, particularly when the initial DTWT configuration is far from steady\\nstate.\\n  To accelerate the model spin-up process we developed HydroStartML, a machine\\nlearning emulator trained on steady-state DTWT configurations across the\\ncontiguous United States. HydroStartML predicts, based on available data like\\nconductivity and surface slopes, a DTWT configuration of the respective\\nwatershed, which can be used as an initial DTWT.\\n  Our results show that initializing spin-up computations with HydroStartML\\npredictions leads to faster convergence than with other initial configurations\\nlike spatially constant DTWTs. The emulator accurately predicts configurations\\nclose to steady state, even for terrain configurations not seen in training,\\nand allows especially significant reductions in computational spin-up effort in\\nregions with deep DTWTs. This work opens the door for hybrid approaches that\\nblend machine learning and traditional simulation, enhancing predictive\\naccuracy and efficiency in hydrology for improving water resource management\\nand understanding complex environmental interactions.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.geo-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.geo-ph,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T10:24:34Z\"}"}
