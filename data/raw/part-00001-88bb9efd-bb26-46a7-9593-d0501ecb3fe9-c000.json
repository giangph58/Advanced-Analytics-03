Vanhecke described a Hamiltonian system with two degrees of\\nfreedom and a polynomial Hamiltonian integrable in Abelian functions of two\\nvariables. This system provides a convenient example of an integrable system in\\nwhich integral curves are wound on a two-dimensional manifold, an algebraic\\nsurface in a 4-dimensional phase space. In this report, we show that all\\nnecessary calculations can be performed in the Sage system. The role of periods\\nof Abelian integrals and their commensurability in describing the nature of the\\nwinding of integral curves on an algebraic integral surface is discussed. The\\nresults of numerical experiments performed in fdm for Sage are presented.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.SI\", \"categories\": \"nlin.SI,math.CA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T12:51:05Z\"}"}
