{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15151v1\", \"title\": \"Artificial compressibility method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes\\n  equations with variable density\", \"summary\": \"We introduce a novel artificial compressibility technique to approximate the\\nincompressible Navier-Stokes equations with variable fluid properties such as\\ndensity and dynamical viscosity. The proposed scheme used the couple pressure\\nand momentum, equal to the density times the velocity, as primary unknowns. It\\nalso involves an adequate treatment of the diffusive operator such that\\ntreating the nonlinear convective term explicitly leads to a scheme with time\\nindependent stiffness matrices that is suitable for pseudo-spectral methods.\\nThe stability and temporal convergence of the semi-implicit version of the\\nscheme is established under the hypothesis that the density is approximated\\nwith a method that conserves the minimum-maximum principle. Numerical\\nillustrations confirm that both the semi-implicit and explicit scheme are\\nstable and converge with order one under classic CFL condition. Moreover, the\\nproposed scheme is shown to perform better than a momentum based pressure\\nprojection method, previously introduced by one of the authors, on setups\\ninvolving gravitational waves and immiscible multi-fluids in a cylinder.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T14:55:24Z\"}"}
