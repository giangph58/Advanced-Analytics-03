We investigate whether benign nonconvexity continues to\\nhold when the factor matrices are constrained to be elementwise nonnegative --\\na common practical requirement. In the simple setting of a rank-1 nonnegative\\nground truth, we confirm that benign nonconvexity holds in the fully-observed\\ncase with RIP constant $\\\\delta=0$. Surprisingly, however, this property fails\\nto extend to the partially-observed case with any arbitrarily small RIP\\nconstant $\\\\delta\\\\to0^{+}$, irrespective of rank overparameterization. This\\nfinding exposes a critical theoretical gap: the continuity argument widely used\\nto explain the empirical robustness of low-rank matrix recovery fundamentally\\nbreaks down once nonnegative constraints are imposed.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.LG,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T17:43:35Z\"}"}
