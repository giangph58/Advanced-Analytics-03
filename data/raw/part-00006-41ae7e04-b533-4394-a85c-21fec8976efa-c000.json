{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11448v1\", \"title\": \"Full-Diversity Construction-D Lattices: Design and Decoding Perspective\\n  on Block-Fading Channels\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces a novel framework for constructing algebraic lattices\\nbased on Construction-D, leveraging nested linear codes and prime ideals from\\nalgebraic number fields. We focus on the application of these lattices in\\nblock-fading (BF) channels, which are characterized by piecewise-constant\\nfading across blocks of transmitted symbols. This approach results in a\\nsemi-systematic generator matrix, providing a structured foundation for\\nhigh-dimensional lattice design for BF channels. The proposed Construction-D\\nlattices exhibit the full diversity property, making them highly effective for\\nerror performance improvement. To address this, we develop an efficient\\ndecoding algorithm designed specifically for full-diversity Construction-D\\nlattices.\\n  Simulations indicate that the proposed lattices notably enhance error\\nperformance compared to full-diversity Construction-A lattices in diversity-2\\ncases. Interestingly, unlike AWGN channels, the expected performance\\nenhancement of Construction-D over Construction-A, resulting from an increased\\nnumber of nested code levels, was observed only in the two-level and\\ndiversity-2 cases. This phenomenon is likely attributed to the intensified\\neffects of error propagation that occur during successive cancellation at\\nhigher levels, as well as the higher diversity orders.\\n  These findings highlight the promise of Construction-D lattices as an\\neffective coding strategy for enhancing communication reliability in BF\\nchannels.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T17:57:56Z\"}"}
