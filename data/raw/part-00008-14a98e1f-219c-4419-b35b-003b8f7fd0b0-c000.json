These methods are model-free and applicable to\\nalmost any sample size. They are grounded in order statistics theory and have a\\nwide range of applications, as they simply require the assumption of a finite\\nexpectation. Even in cases when a particular risk model exists, the new methods\\nprovide clarity, security and simplicity. The methodology is applicable to the\\nbehavior of financial markets, and the results may be compared to those\\nprovided by extreme value theory.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T06:10:57Z\"}"}
