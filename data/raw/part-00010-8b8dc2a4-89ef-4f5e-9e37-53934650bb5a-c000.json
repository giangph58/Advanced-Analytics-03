{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20742v1\", \"title\": \"Non-Equilibrium Phase Changes in Aircraft Exhaust: A Computational Study\\n  on Early Contrail Formation\", \"summary\": \"A numerical framework is developed to model contrail formation in the\\nnear-field exhaust of aircraft engines, resolving non-equilibrium phase\\ntransitions in compressible, multi-component, non-ideal fluid flows. The\\napproach combines well-established methods from steam turbine modeling for\\nliquid-phase transitions with cloud microphysics models for ice formation. It\\nresolves homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation, interphase momentum\\nexchange, and polydispersed size distributions of droplets, ice crystals, and\\nsoot particles. These models are implemented in a parallelized finite-volume\\nsolver and applied to a high-bypass turbofan exhaust configuration with\\nsimplified geometry. Results indicate that non-equilibrium effects strongly\\ninfluence condensation and freezing dynamics, while nozzle geometry and water\\nvapor content modulate local supersaturation and phase transition pathways. The\\nfindings underscore the limitations of equilibrium-based models and highlight\\nthe value of physics-based, scalable tools for analyzing contrail formation\\nacross fuels and propulsion systems.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn,physics.ao-ph,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:24:24Z\"}"}
