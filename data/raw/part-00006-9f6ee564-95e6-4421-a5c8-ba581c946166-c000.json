In the overdamped\\nregime, it has been well-known that the diffusion constant $D^*$ is given by\\nthe Lifson-Jackson (LJ) formula. With a tilted potential, this model can\\nexhibit giant diffusion. In this work, we start from the basic argument that\\nsince any quasi-periodic potential can be approximated accurately using a\\nperiodic potential, this formula and the associated physics should also apply\\nto the quasi-periodic potential after some proper redefinition. We derive $D^*$\\nfrom the Smoluchowski equation using the fact that its asymptotic solution is a\\nproduct of a Boltzmann weight and a Gaussian envelope function. Then we\\nanalytically calculate $D^*$ in terms of Bessel functions. Finally, we study\\nthe giant diffusion with quasi-periodic potentials, generalize the\\ncorresponding formula to the condition with tilted potential under the same\\nargument, and calculate $D^*$ analytically. This work generalizes the Brownian\\nmotion from periodic potentials to the much broader quasi-periodic potentials,\\nwhich should have applications in interdisciplinary fields in physics,\\nchemistry, engineering, and life sciences.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T08:50:59Z\"}"}
