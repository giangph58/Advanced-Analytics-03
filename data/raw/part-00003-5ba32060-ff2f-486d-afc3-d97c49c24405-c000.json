Such correlations can also be used to\\nstudy cold nuclear matter effects arising in $p$+A collisions. This proceeding\\nsummarizes recent advances achieved by studying hard-jet correlations in large\\nand small systems discussed at Hard Probes 2024, complementing the experimental\\njet overview.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-ex\", \"categories\": \"nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T02:26:52Z\"}"}
