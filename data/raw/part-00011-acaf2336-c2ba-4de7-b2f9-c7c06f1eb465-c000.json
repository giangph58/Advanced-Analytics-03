{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12872v1\", \"title\": \"On perfect sampling: ROCFTP with Metropolis-multishift coupler\", \"summary\": \"ROCFTP is a perfect sampling algorithm that employs various random\\noperations, and requiring a specific Markov chain construction for each target.\\nTo overcome this requirement, the Metropolis algorithm is incorporated as a\\nrandom operation within ROCFTP. While the Metropolis sampler functions as a\\nrandom operation, it isn't a coupler. However, by employing normal multishift\\ncoupler as a symmetric proposal for Metropolis, we obtain ROCFTP with\\nMetropolis-multishift. Initially designed for bounded state spaces, ROCFTP's\\napplicability to targets with unbounded state spaces is extended through the\\nintroduction of the Most Interest Range (MIR) for practical use. It was\\ndemonstrated that selecting MIR decreases the likelihood of ROCFTP hitting\\n$MIR^C$ by a factor of (1 - {\\\\epsilon}), which is beneficial for practical\\nimplementation. The algorithm exhibits a convergence rate characterized by\\nexponential decay. Its performance is rigorously evaluated across various\\ntargets, and tests ensure its goodness of fit. Lastly, an R package is provided\\nfor generating exact samples using ROCFTP Metropolis-multishift.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.CO\", \"categories\": \"stat.CO,math.ST,stat.ME,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T12:00:03Z\"}"}
