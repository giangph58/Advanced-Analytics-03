It has been studied\\nextensively on various platforms, but has remained elusive in electron\\nmicroscopy. Transmission electron microscopes are well-established tools for\\nmaterials characterisation with unparalleled spatial resolution. They provide\\ncontrol over the preparation and detection of high energy electrons, with\\nlargely unexploited potential in the study of many-body quantum correlations.\\nHere, we demonstrate entanglement in electron-photon pairs generated via\\ncathodoluminescence in a transmission electron microscope. Employing\\ncoincidence imaging techniques adapted from photonic quantum optics, we\\nreconstruct both near- and far-field ``ghost'' images of periodic transmission\\nmasks. By measuring spatial and momentum correlations, we show a violation of\\nthe classical uncertainty bound: $\\\\Delta x_-^2 \\\\Delta k_+^2 = 0.502 \\\\pm\\n0.047<1$. Hence, we demonstrate entanglement in position and momentum -- the\\ncontinuous variables at the base of most imaging methods, bridging the fields\\nof electron microscopy and quantum optics. Our work paves the way for exploring\\nquantum correlations in free-electron systems and their application to\\nquantum-enhanced imaging techniques on the nanoscale.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:58:50Z\"}"}
