{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12005v1\", \"title\": \"Voice Conversion with Diverse Intonation using Conditional Variational\\n  Auto-Encoder\", \"summary\": \"Voice conversion is a task of synthesizing an utterance with target speaker's\\nvoice while maintaining linguistic information of the source utterance. While a\\nspeaker can produce varying utterances from a single script with different\\nintonations, conventional voice conversion models were limited to producing\\nonly one result per source input. To overcome this limitation, we propose a\\nnovel approach for voice conversion with diverse intonations using conditional\\nvariational autoencoder (CVAE). Experiments have shown that the speaker's style\\nfeature can be mapped into a latent space with Gaussian distribution. We have\\nalso been able to convert voices with more diverse intonation by making the\\nposterior of the latent space more complex with inverse autoregressive flow\\n(IAF). As a result, the converted voice not only has a diversity of\\nintonations, but also has better sound quality than the model without CVAE.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SD\", \"categories\": \"cs.SD,cs.LG,eess.AS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T11:59:56Z\"}"}
