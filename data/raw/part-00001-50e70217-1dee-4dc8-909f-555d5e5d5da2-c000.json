{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06231v1\", \"title\": \"Orb-v3: atomistic simulation at scale\", \"summary\": \"We introduce Orb-v3, the next generation of the Orb family of universal\\ninteratomic potentials. Models in this family expand the\\nperformance-speed-memory Pareto frontier, offering near SoTA performance across\\na range of evaluations with a >10x reduction in latency and > 8x reduction in\\nmemory. Our experiments systematically traverse this frontier, charting the\\ntrade-off induced by roto-equivariance, conservatism and graph sparsity.\\nContrary to recent literature, we find that non-equivariant, non-conservative\\narchitectures can accurately model physical properties, including those which\\nrequire higher-order derivatives of the potential energy surface.\\n  This model release is guided by the principle that the most valuable\\nfoundation models for atomic simulation will excel on all fronts: accuracy,\\nlatency and system size scalability. The reward for doing so is a new era of\\ncomputational chemistry driven by high-throughput and mesoscale all-atom\\nsimulations.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T17:27:34Z\"}"}
