{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06567v1\", \"title\": \"A Novel Angle-Delay-Doppler Estimation Scheme for AFDM-ISAC System in\\n  Mixed Near-field and Far-field Scenarios\", \"summary\": \"The recently proposed multi-chirp waveform, affine frequency division\\nmultiplexing (AFDM), is considered as a potential candidate for integrated\\nsensing and communication (ISAC). However, acquiring accurate target sensing\\nparameter information becomes challenging due to fractional delay and Doppler\\nshift occurrence, as well as effects introduced by the coexistence of\\nnear-field (NF) and far-field (FF) targets associated with large-scale antenna\\nsystems. In this paper, we propose a novel angle-delay-Doppler estimation\\nscheme for AFDM-ISAC system in mixed NF and FF scenarios. Specifically, we\\nmodel the received ISAC signals as a third-order tensor that admits a low-rank\\nCANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) format. By employing the Vandermonde nature of the\\nfactor matrix and the spatial smoothing technique, we develop a structured CP\\ndecomposition method that guarantees the condition for uniqueness. We further\\npropose a low-complexity estimation scheme to acquire target sensing parameters\\nwith fractional values, including angle of arrival/departure (AoA/AoD), delay\\nand Doppler shift accurately. We also derive the Cram\\\\'er-Rao Lower Bound\\n(CRLB) as a benchmark and analyze the complexity of our proposed scheme.\\nFinally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and\\nsuperiority of our proposed scheme.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T04:02:22Z\"}"}
