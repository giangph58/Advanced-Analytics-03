{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15182v1\", \"title\": \"Tiger200K: Manually Curated High Visual Quality Video Dataset from UGC\\n  Platform\", \"summary\": \"The recent surge in open-source text-to-video generation models has\\nsignificantly energized the research community, yet their dependence on\\nproprietary training datasets remains a key constraint. While existing open\\ndatasets like Koala-36M employ algorithmic filtering of web-scraped videos from\\nearly platforms, they still lack the quality required for fine-tuning advanced\\nvideo generation models. We present Tiger200K, a manually curated high visual\\nquality video dataset sourced from User-Generated Content (UGC) platforms. By\\nprioritizing visual fidelity and aesthetic quality, Tiger200K underscores the\\ncritical role of human expertise in data curation, and providing high-quality,\\ntemporally consistent video-text pairs for fine-tuning and optimizing video\\ngeneration architectures through a simple but effective pipeline including shot\\nboundary detection, OCR, border detecting, motion filter and fine bilingual\\ncaption. The dataset will undergo ongoing expansion and be released as an\\nopen-source initiative to advance research and applications in video generative\\nmodels.
