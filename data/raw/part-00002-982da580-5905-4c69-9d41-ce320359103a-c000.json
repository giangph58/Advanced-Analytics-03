In this paper, we\\nintroduce a modified definition for the scaled graph, termed the signed scaled\\ngraph (SSG), in which the phase component is characterized by making use of the\\nHilbert transform. Whereas the original definition of the scaled graph uses\\nunsigned phase angles, the new definition has signed phase angles which ensures\\nthe possibility to differentiate between phase-lead and phase-lag properties in\\na system. Making such distinction is important from both an analysis and a\\nsynthesis perspective, and helps in providing tighter stability estimates of\\nfeedback interconnections. We show how the proposed SSG leads to intuitive\\ncharacterizations of positive real and negative imaginary nonlinear systems,\\nand present various interconnection results. We showcase the effectiveness of\\nour results through several motivating examples.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T09:10:26Z\"}"}
