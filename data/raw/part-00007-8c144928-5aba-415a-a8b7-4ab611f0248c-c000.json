{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12062v1\", \"title\": \"A Scalable Framework for Post-Quantum Authentication in Public Key\\n  Infrastructures\", \"summary\": \"This work explores the performance and scalability of a hierarchical\\ncertificate authority framework with automated certificate issuance employing\\npost-quantum cryptographic (PQC) signature algorithms. The system is designed\\nfor compatibility with both classical and PQC algorithms, promoting\\ncrypto-agility while ensuring robust security against quantum-based threats.\\nThe proposed framework design expects minimal cryptographic requirements from\\npotential clients, protects certificates of high importance against\\ncross-dependent chains-of-trust and allows for prompt switching between\\nclassical and PQC algorithms. Finally, we evaluate SPHINCS$^+$, Falcon, and\\nDilithium variants in various configurations of certificate issuance and\\nverification accommodating a large client base, underlining the trade-offs in\\nbalancing performance, scalability, and security.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T13:18:11Z\"}"}
