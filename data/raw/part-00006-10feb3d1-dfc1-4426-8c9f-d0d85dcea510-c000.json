{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14830v1\", \"title\": \"Solving All Seismic Tomographic Problems using Deep Learning\", \"summary\": \"In a variety of geoscientific applications scientists often need to image\\nproperties of the Earth's interior in order to understand the heterogeneity and\\nprocesses taking place within the Earth. Seismic tomography is one such method\\nwhich has been used widely to study properties of the subsurface. In order to\\nsolve tomographic problems efficiently, neural network-based methods have been\\nintroduced to geophysics. However, these methods can only be applied to certain\\ntypes of problems with fixed acquisition geometry at a specific site. In this\\nstudy we extend neural network-based methods to problems with various scales\\nand acquisition geometries by using graph mixture density networks (MDNs). We\\ntrain a graph MDN for 2D tomographic problems using simulated velocity models\\nand travel time data, and apply the trained network to both synthetic and real\\ndata problems that have various scales and station distributions at different\\nsites. The results demonstrate that graph MDNs can provide comparable solutions\\nto those obtained using traditional Bayesian methods in seconds, and therefore\\nprovide the possibility to use graph MDNs to produce rapid solutions for all\\nkinds of seismic tomographic problems over the world.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.geo-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.geo-ph,physics.data-an\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T03:14:57Z\"}"}
