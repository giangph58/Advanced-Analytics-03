We exhibit\\nthe structure of various composite multiplets that are pivotal in the\\nconstruction. We also present the form of the gauged Riemann-squared and\\nGauss-Bonnet superinvariants in a dilaton-Weyl multiplet. As a first\\napplication of the new curvature squared invariants, we compute their\\ncorrections to holographic central charges and the Euclidean action of\\nsupersymmetric charged rotating black holes, exhibiting exact matching between\\nthe gravity and CFT results.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T04:35:09Z\"}"}
