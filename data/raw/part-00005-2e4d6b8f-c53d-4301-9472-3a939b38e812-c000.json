The control task is formulated as an inference\\nproblem by conditioning the Gaussian process prior on the setpoints and\\nincorporating pointwise soft-constraints as further virtual setpoints. We apply\\nthis method to systems of nonlinear differential equations, obtaining a local\\napproximation through the linearization around an equilibrium point. In the\\ncase of an asymptotically stable equilibrium point convergence is given through\\nthe Bayesian inference schema of the Gaussian Process. Results for this are\\ndemonstrated in a numerical example.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T07:25:14Z\"}"}
