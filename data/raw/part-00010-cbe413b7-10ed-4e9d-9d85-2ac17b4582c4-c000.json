{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14923v1\", \"title\": \"Maximum Entropy Production Principle of Thermodynamics for the Birth and\\n  Evolution of Life\", \"summary\": \"Research on the birth and evolution of life are reviewed with reference to\\nthe maximum entropy production principle (MEPP). It has been shown that this\\nprinciple is essential for consistent understanding of the birth and evolution\\nof life. First, a recent work for the birth of a self-replicative system as\\npre-RNA life is reviewed in relation to the MEPP. A critical condition of\\npolymer concentration in a local system is reported by a dynamical system\\napproach, above which, an exponential increase of entropy production is\\nguaranteed. Secondly, research works of early stage of evolutions are reviewed;\\nexperimental research for the numbers of cells necessary for forming a\\nmulti-cellular organization, and numerical research of differentiation of a\\nmodel system and its relation with MEPP. It is suggested by this review article\\nthat the late stage of evolution is characterized by formation of society and\\nexternal entropy production. A hypothesis on the general route of evolution is\\ndiscussed from the birth to the present life which follows the MEPP. Some\\nexamples of life which happened to face poor thermodynamic condition are\\npresented with thermodynamic discussion. It is observed through this review\\nthat MEPP is consistently useful for thermodynamic understanding of birth and\\nevolution of life, subject to a thermodynamic condition far from equilibrium.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.bio-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.bio-ph,cond-mat.stat-mech,nlin.AO,physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T07:46:53Z\"}"}
