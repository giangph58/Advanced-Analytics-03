{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06655v1\", \"title\": \"Identifying the Nano Interface Through Phase\", \"summary\": \"The quantum dots (QD) interface in solution can play significant roles in\\nelectron transfer dynamics for quantum dots-sensitized solar cells and\\ndifferent biological, environmental, and industrial systems. Here, we predict\\nan avenue to identify the contribution of the quantum dots interface created\\nstatic electric field on the nonlinear optical response (NLO) due to four-wave\\nmixing (FWM), especially for the nanoparticles where surface contribution is\\nhigh. We implement a way to disentangle the FWM response in QDs originating\\nfrom the three incoming oscillating laser fields (NLOoscillating) and a\\ncontribution (NLOstatic) arising from the three oscillating laser fields and\\nthe static electric field caused by the interface. Advanced two-dimensional\\nelectronic spectroscopy (2DES) employs phase-resolved heterodyne techniques\\nwhere FWM response is measured in a particular phase-matched direction, and the\\nresponse is distinctively phase sensitive. Theoretical analysis shows\\nalteration in the interface can introduce phase variation in the NLOstatic\\nsignal, resulting in a distinct change in the 2D-spectra. Our studies establish\\na range of ionic strength, which can be important to untwine the usual NLO\\nsignal (NLOoscillating) from the NLO (NLOstatic) contributed by the interface\\nof quantum dots. This analysis may open up the possibility to study the\\ndifferent kinds of dynamics occurring specifically in the interface and also\\nwill pave the path towards different ion interactions through phase change in\\n2D spectra, and enormous scope will be employing deep learning-assisted phase\\nrecognition.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T07:45:26Z\"}"}
