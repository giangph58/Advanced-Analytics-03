We use a low-energy effective model, the\\nQuark-Meson model, both in the mean-field approximation and within the\\nFunctional Renormalization Group, the latter in the Local Potential\\nApproximation. The model provides results both for real and imaginary values of\\n$\\\\mu$, thus a direct comparison can be performed between the prediction of the\\nmodel for real values of $\\\\mu$ and the ones obtained via extrapolation from the\\nresults at imaginary $\\\\mu$. We compute an effective convergence radius for the\\nreconstruction technique, $\\\\mu_\\\\mathrm{conv}$, and find\\n$\\\\mu_\\\\mathrm{conv}\\\\approx146$ MeV. This value sustains the validity of the\\nreconstruction technique also for finite and moderate values of the chemical\\npotential. On the other hand, within our model, $\\\\mu_\\\\mathrm{conv}$ is quite\\nsmaller then the value of $\\\\mu$ where we find the actual critical endpoint.\\nNear this point of the phase diagram, we find a discrepancy between the actual\\nphase boundary and the one pbtained via extrapolatin of $\\\\approx150\\\\%$.\\nTherefore, our results show that the location of the critical endpoint obtained\\nvia reconstruction from imaginary $\\\\mu$ should be considered with due caution\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-lat,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T17:03:22Z\"}"}
