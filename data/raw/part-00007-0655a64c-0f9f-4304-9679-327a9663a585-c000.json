A graph is\\nperfectly divisible if for each of its induced subgraph $H$, $V (H)$ can be\\npartitioned into $A$ and $B$ such that $H[A]$ is perfect and $\\\\omega(H[B]) <\\n\\\\omega(H)$. Karthick {\\\\em et al.} [Electron. J. Comb. 28 (2021), P2.20.]\\nconjectured that fork-free graphs are perfectly divisible, and they proved that\\neach (fork, co-cricket)-free graph is either claw-free or perfectly divisible.\\nIn this paper, we show that every (fork, {\\\\em antifork}$\\\\cup K_1$)-free graph\\nis perfectly divisible. This improves some results of Karthick {\\\\em et al.}.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T13:58:32Z\"}"}
