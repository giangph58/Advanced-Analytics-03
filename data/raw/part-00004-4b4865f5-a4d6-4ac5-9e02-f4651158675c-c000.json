The examples presented suggest that there are\\nconsiderable differences in the size of the domains of definition of the\\nvarious types of generating functions studied. Furthermore, the types of\\ngenerating functions for which, in general, large domains of definitions can be\\nguarantied were identified. The resulting domain sizes of these generators are\\nusually sufficiently large to be useful in practice, for example for the\\nlong-term simulations of accelerator and other Hamiltonian system dynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS,math.SG,physics.acc-ph,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:13:56Z\"}"}
