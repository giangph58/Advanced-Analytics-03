{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19478v1\", \"title\": \"CasaGPT: Cuboid Arrangement and Scene Assembly for Interior Design\", \"summary\": \"We present a novel approach for indoor scene synthesis, which learns to\\narrange decomposed cuboid primitives to represent 3D objects within a scene.\\nUnlike conventional methods that use bounding boxes to determine the placement\\nand scale of 3D objects, our approach leverages cuboids as a straightforward\\nyet highly effective alternative for modeling objects. This allows for compact\\nscene generation while minimizing object intersections. Our approach, coined\\nCasaGPT for Cuboid Arrangement and Scene Assembly, employs an autoregressive\\nmodel to sequentially arrange cuboids, producing physically plausible scenes.\\nBy applying rejection sampling during the fine-tuning stage to filter out\\nscenes with object collisions, our model further reduces intersections and\\nenhances scene quality. Additionally, we introduce a refined dataset,\\n3DFRONT-NC, which eliminates significant noise presented in the original\\ndataset, 3D-FRONT. Extensive experiments on the 3D-FRONT dataset as well as our\\ndataset demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms the\\nstate-of-the-art methods, enhancing the realism of generated scenes, and\\nproviding a promising direction for 3D scene synthesis.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T04:35:04Z\"}"}
