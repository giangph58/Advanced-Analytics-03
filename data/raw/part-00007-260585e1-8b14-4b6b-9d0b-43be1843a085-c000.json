All but one\\ncomponent correspond to Fano threefolds. For these the generalized Hodge\\nconjecture is known, but thanks to the nature of the decomposition we can give\\na direct proof for one of the components.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:52:46Z\"}"}
