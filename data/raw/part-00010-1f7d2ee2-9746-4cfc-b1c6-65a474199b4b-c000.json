{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11037v1\", \"title\": \"Statistical complexity as a probe of mass and phase structure in compact\\n  objects\", \"summary\": \"In this work, we present a comprehensive and systematic study of the\\nstatistical complexity, originally introduced by L\\\\'opez-Ruiz, Mancini, and\\nCalbet [Phys. Lett. A 209, 321-326 (1995)], across a broad range of compact\\nstar models. We explore how complexity correlates not only with macroscopic\\nobservables such as mass and radius, but also with the microscopic\\ncharacteristics of the underlying equation of state. By incorporating both\\nrealistic equations of state and analytical solutions to Einstein's field\\nequations, we demonstrate that gravitational mass plays a dominant role in\\ndetermining the behavior of complexity. Furthermore, we show that strong phase\\ntransitions within the stellar interior, such as those hypothesized in hybrid\\nstars, can manifest as distinct features in the complexity profile, offering a\\npotential informational signature of such transitions. This work offers new\\ninsights into the link between information theory and compact object physics,\\nhighlighting complexity's potential as a diagnostic tool in astrophysics.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.HE,gr-qc,nucl-th,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T09:59:47Z\"}"}
