{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05026v1\", \"title\": \"G-FOCUS: Towards a Robust Method for Assessing UI Design Persuasiveness\", \"summary\": \"Evaluating user interface (UI) design effectiveness extends beyond aesthetics\\nto influencing user behavior, a principle central to Design Persuasiveness. A/B\\ntesting is the predominant method for determining which UI variations drive\\nhigher user engagement, but it is costly and time-consuming. While recent\\nVision-Language Models (VLMs) can process automated UI analysis, current\\napproaches focus on isolated design attributes rather than comparative\\npersuasiveness-the key factor in optimizing user interactions. To address this,\\nwe introduce WiserUI-Bench, a benchmark designed for Pairwise UI Design\\nPersuasiveness Assessment task, featuring 300 real-world UI image pairs labeled\\nwith A/B test results and expert rationales. Additionally, we propose G-FOCUS,\\na novel inference-time reasoning strategy that enhances VLM-based\\npersuasiveness assessment by reducing position bias and improving evaluation\\naccuracy. Experimental results show that G-FOCUS surpasses existing inference\\nstrategies in consistency and accuracy for pairwise UI evaluation. Through\\npromoting VLM-driven evaluation of UI persuasiveness, our work offers an\\napproach to complement A/B testing, propelling progress in scalable UI\\npreference modeling and design optimization. Code and data will be released\\npublicly.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T08:00:32Z\"}"}
