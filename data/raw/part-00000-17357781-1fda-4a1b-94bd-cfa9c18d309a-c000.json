{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07656v1\", \"title\": \"Integrated Sensing, Computing, and Semantic Communication with Fluid\\n  Antenna for Metaverse\", \"summary\": \"The integration of sensing and communication (ISAC) is pivotal for the\\nMetaverse but faces challenges like high data volume and privacy concerns. This\\npaper proposes a novel integrated sensing, computing, and semantic\\ncommunication (ISCSC) framework, which uses semantic communication to transmit\\nonly contextual information, reducing data overhead and enhancing efficiency.\\nTo address the sensitivity of semantic communication to channel conditions,\\nfluid antennas (FAs) are introduced, enabling dynamic adaptability. The\\nFA-enabled ISCSC framework considers multiple users and extended targets\\ncomposed of a series of scatterers, formulating a joint optimization problem to\\nmaximize the data rate while ensuring sensing accuracy and meeting\\ncomputational and power constraints. An alternating optimization (AO) method\\ndecomposes the problem into subproblems for ISAC beamforming, FA positioning,\\nand semantic extraction. Simulations confirm the framework's effectiveness in\\nimproving data rates and sensing performance.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP,cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T11:13:08Z\"}"}
