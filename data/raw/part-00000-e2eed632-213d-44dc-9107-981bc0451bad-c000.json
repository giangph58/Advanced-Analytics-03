{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16866v1\", \"title\": \"An Adaptive ML Framework for Power Converter Monitoring via Federated\\n  Transfer Learning\", \"summary\": \"This study explores alternative framework configurations for adapting thermal\\nmachine learning (ML) models for power converters by combining transfer\\nlearning (TL) and federated learning (FL) in a piecewise manner. This approach\\ninherently addresses challenges such as varying operating conditions, data\\nsharing limitations, and security implications. The framework starts with a\\nbase model that is incrementally adapted by multiple clients via adapting three\\nstate-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques: Fine-tuning, Transfer Component\\nAnalysis (TCA), and Deep Domain Adaptation (DDA). The Flower framework is\\nemployed for FL, using Federated Averaging for aggregation. Validation with\\nfield data demonstrates that fine-tuning offers a straightforward TL approach\\nwith high accuracy, making it suitable for practical applications. Benchmarking\\nresults reveal a comprehensive comparison of these methods, showcasing their\\nrespective strengths and weaknesses when applied in different scenarios.\\nLocally hosted FL enhances performance when data aggregation is not feasible,\\nwhile cloud-based FL becomes more practical with a significant increase in the\\nnumber of clients, addressing scalability and connectivity challenges.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T16:39:54Z\"}"}
