{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20615v1\", \"title\": \"Multi-Sensor Fusion for Quadruped Robot State Estimation using Invariant\\n  Filtering and Smoothing\", \"summary\": \"This letter introduces two multi-sensor state estimation frameworks for\\nquadruped robots, built on the Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (InEKF) and\\nInvariant Smoother (IS). The proposed methods, named E-InEKF and E-IS, fuse\\nkinematics, IMU, LiDAR, and GPS data to mitigate position drift, particularly\\nalong the z-axis, a common issue in proprioceptive-based approaches. We derived\\nobservation models that satisfy group-affine properties to integrate LiDAR\\nodometry and GPS into InEKF and IS. LiDAR odometry is incorporated using\\nIterative Closest Point (ICP) registration on a parallel thread, preserving the\\ncomputational efficiency of proprioceptive-based state estimation. We evaluate\\nE-InEKF and E-IS with and without exteroceptive sensors, benchmarking them\\nagainst LiDAR-based odometry methods in indoor and outdoor experiments using\\nthe KAIST HOUND2 robot. Our methods achieve lower Relative Position Errors\\n(RPE) and significantly reduce Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE), with\\nimprovements of up to 28% indoors and 40% outdoors compared to LIO-SAM and\\nFAST-LIO2. Additionally, we compare E-InEKF and E-IS in terms of computational\\nefficiency and accuracy.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T10:29:00Z\"}"}
