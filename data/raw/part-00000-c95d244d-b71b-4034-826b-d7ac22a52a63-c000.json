{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24219v1\", \"title\": \"MB-ORES: A Multi-Branch Object Reasoner for Visual Grounding in Remote\\n  Sensing\", \"summary\": \"We propose a unified framework that integrates object detection (OD) and\\nvisual grounding (VG) for remote sensing (RS) imagery. To support conventional\\nOD and establish an intuitive prior for VG task, we fine-tune an open-set\\nobject detector using referring expression data, framing it as a partially\\nsupervised OD task. In the first stage, we construct a graph representation of\\neach image, comprising object queries, class embeddings, and proposal\\nlocations. Then, our task-aware architecture processes this graph to perform\\nthe VG task. The model consists of: (i) a multi-branch network that integrates\\nspatial, visual, and categorical features to generate task-aware proposals, and\\n(ii) an object reasoning network that assigns probabilities across proposals,\\nfollowed by a soft selection mechanism for final referring object localization.\\nOur model demonstrates superior performance on the OPT-RSVG and DIOR-RSVG\\ndatasets, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods\\nwhile retaining classical OD capabilities. The code will be available in our\\nrepository: \\\\url{https://github.com/rd20karim/MB-ORES}.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI,cs.CL,cs.LG,cs.MM\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:36:41Z\"}"}
