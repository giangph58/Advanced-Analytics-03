Under a natural\\nclosing property, we show that the top topological Lyapunov exponent can be\\napproximated by periodic orbits. We also extend the notion of the joint\\nspectral radius to this setting, interpreting it via the exponential growth of\\ncurves under iterated mapping classes. Our approach connects ideas from ergodic\\ntheory, Teichm\\\\\\\"uller geometry, and spectral theory, and suggests a broader\\nframework for similar results.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS,math.GR,math.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T14:22:46Z\"}"}
