{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13008v1\", \"title\": \"Reconstruction and Performance Evaluation of FASER's Emulsion Detector\\n  at the LHC\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents the reconstruction and performance evaluation of the\\nFASER$\\\\nu$ emulsion detector, which aims to measure interactions from neutrinos\\nproduced in the forward direction of proton-proton collisions at the CERN Large\\nHadron Collider. The detector, composed of tungsten plates interleaved with\\nemulsion films, records charged particles with sub-micron precision. A key\\nchallenge arises from the extremely high track density environment, reaching\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ tracks per cm$^2$. To address this, dedicated alignment\\ntechniques and track reconstruction algorithms have been developed, building on\\ntechniques from previous experiments and introducing further optimizations. The\\nperformance of the detector is studied by evaluating the single-film\\nefficiency, position and angular resolution, and the impact parameter\\ndistribution of reconstructed vertices. The results demonstrate that an\\nalignment precision of 0.3 micrometers and robust track and vertex\\nreconstruction are achieved, enabling accurate neutrino measurements in the TeV\\nenergy range.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T15:16:06Z\"}"}
