We prove that if $U$ is an immediate component of\\nthe basin of an attracting periodic point $\\\\zeta$ of period $p\\\\ge 1$ of a\\ntranscendental entire function $f\\\\colon \\\\mathbb C \\\\to \\\\mathbb C$ from the\\nEremenko--Lyubich class $\\\\mathcal B$, such that $\\\\text{deg} f^p|_U = \\\\infty$\\nand $\\\\overline{\\\\text{Sing}(f^p|_U)}$ is a compact subset of $U$, then the\\nhyperbolic (and, consequently, Hausdorff) dimension of the boundary of $U$ is\\nlarger than $1$. The same holds if $U$ is an immediate component of the basin\\nof a parabolic $p$-periodic point $\\\\zeta$, under an additional assumption\\n$\\\\zeta \\\\notin \\\\overline{\\\\text{Sing}(f^p)}$. We also show that if $U$ is a\\nbounded immediate component of an attracting basin of a transcendental entire\\nfunction $f$, then the hyperbolic dimension of the boundary of $U$ is larger\\nthan $1$. In particular, this implies that the boundary of a component of an\\nattracting basin of a transcendental entire function is never a smooth or\\nrectifiable curve.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T12:43:42Z\"}"}
