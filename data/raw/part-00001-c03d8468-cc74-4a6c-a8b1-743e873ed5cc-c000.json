We apply our methodology to Canadian yield curve data\\nand French sub-national age-specific mortality data. We find evidence that\\nthese time series are mostly integrated of order one, while some have\\nfractional orders exceeding or falling below one.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T11:20:38Z\"}"}
