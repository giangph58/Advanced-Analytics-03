However,\\nrecent insights suggest that weak interactions can provide non-trivial\\nexperimental evidence for the physical delocalization of a single particle\\npassing through an interferometer. Here, we present an experimental setup that\\ncan quantify the delocalization of individual photons using the rate of\\npolarization flips induced by small rotations of polarization. The results show\\nthat photons detected in equal superpositions of the two paths are delocalized\\nwhen detected in a high probability output port, and \\\"super-localized\\\" when\\ndetected in a low probability output port. We can thus confirm that\\ndelocalization depends on the detection of photons in the output of the\\ninterferometer, providing direct experimental evidence for the dependence of\\nphysical reality on the context established by a future measurement.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T06:20:46Z\"}"}
