{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21686v1\", \"title\": \"The case of AT2022wtn: a Tidal Disruption Event in an interacting galaxy\", \"summary\": \"We present the results from our multi-wavelength monitoring campaign of the\\ntransient AT2022wtn, discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility in the nucleus\\nof SDSSJ232323.79+104107.7, the less massive galaxy in an active merging pair\\nwith a mass ratio of ~10:1. AT2022wtn shows spectroscopic and photometric\\nproperties consistent with a X-ray faint N-strong TDE-H+He with a number of\\npeculiarities. Specifically, a 30-days long plateau at maximum luminosity, a\\ncorresponding dip in temperature and the development of a double-horned N III+\\nHe II line profile. Strong and time-evolving velocity offsets in the TDE broad\\nemission lines and the detection of a transient radio emission, indicate the\\npresence of outflows. Overall, the observed properties are consistent with the\\nfull disruption of a low-mass star by a ~10$^{6}$ M$_{\\\\odot}$ SMBH followed by\\nan efficient disk formation and the launch of a quasi-spherical reprocessing\\nenvelope of fast expanding outflowing material. The observed differences\\nbetween the He II and the Hydrogen and N III lines can be explained either with\\na spatial separation of the lines emitting region or with a late-time reveal of\\nshocks from the returning debris streams, as the photosphere recedes. Finally,\\nwe present an extensive analysis of the hosting environment and discuss the\\nimplications for the discovery of two TDEs in interacting galaxy pairs, finding\\nindication for an over-representation of TDEs in these systems. The AT2022wtn\\nhost galaxy properties suggest that it is in the early stages of the merger,\\ntherefore we may be witnessing the initial enhanced rate of TDEs in interacting\\ngalaxies before the post-starburst phase.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:23:31Z\"}"}
