In\\ncontrast to the well-studied one-dimensional dissipative Swift-Hohenberg\\nequation, the complex variant introduces a wide array of largely unexplored\\nsolutions. Our study provides a fundamental step in understanding the complex\\ncharacteristics of this equation, particularly for typical classes of\\nsolutions-uniform, periodic, and localized states-and their relationship with\\nthe original dissipative model. Our findings reveal significant differences\\nbetween the two models. For instance, uniform solutions in the conservative\\nmodel are inherently unstable, and periodic solutions are generally unstable\\nexcept within a narrow parameter interval that supports multiple localized\\nstates. Furthermore, we establish a generalized Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion to\\ndetermine the stability of localized states in the conservative equation and\\nrelate it to the stability properties of the dissipative counterpart.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.PS\", \"categories\": \"nlin.PS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:19:21Z\"}"}
