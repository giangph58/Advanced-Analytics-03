{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16867v1\", \"title\": \"A Bayesian Update Method for Exponential Family Projection Filters with\\n  Non-Conjugate Likelihoods\", \"summary\": \"The projection filter is one of the approximations to the solution of the\\noptimal filtering problem. It approximates the filtering density by projecting\\nthe dynamics of the square-root filtering density onto the tangent space of the\\nsquare-root parametric densities manifold. While the projection filters for\\nexponential and mixture families with continuous measurement processes have\\nbeen well studied, the continuous-discrete projection filtering algorithm for\\nnon-conjugate priors has received less attention.\\n  In this paper, we introduce a simple Riemannian optimization method to be\\nused for the Bayesian update step in the continuous-discrete projection filter\\nfor exponential families. Specifically, we show that the Bayesian update can be\\nformulated as an optimization problem of $\\\\alpha$-R\\\\'enyi divergence, where the\\ncorresponding Riemannian gradient can be easily computed. We demonstrate the\\neffectiveness of the proposed method via two highly non-Gaussian Bayesian\\nupdate problems.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T16:43:57Z\"}"}
