{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05119v1\", \"title\": \"USPR: Learning a Unified Solver for Profiled Routing\", \"summary\": \"The Profiled Vehicle Routing Problem (PVRP) extends the classical VRP by\\nincorporating vehicle-client-specific preferences and constraints, reflecting\\nreal-world requirements such as zone restrictions and service-level\\npreferences. While recent reinforcement learning (RL) solvers have shown\\npromise, they require retraining for each new profile distribution, suffer from\\npoor representation ability, and struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution\\ninstances. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing USPR\\n(Unified Solver for Profiled Routing), a novel framework that natively handles\\narbitrary profile types. USPR introduces three key innovations: (i) Profile\\nEmbeddings (PE) to encode any combination of profile types; (ii) Multi-Head\\nProfiled Attention (MHPA), an attention mechanism that models rich interactions\\nbetween vehicles and clients; (iii) Profile-aware Score Reshaping (PSR), which\\ndynamically adjusts decoder logits using profile scores to improve\\ngeneralization. Empirical results on diverse PVRP benchmarks demonstrate that\\nUSPR achieves state-of-the-art results among learning-based methods while\\noffering significant gains in flexibility and computational efficiency.
