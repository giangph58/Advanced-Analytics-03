{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03534v1\", \"title\": \"On quasi-Minnaert resonances in elasticity and their applications to\\n  stress concentrations\", \"summary\": \"This paper unveils and investigates a novel quasi-Minnaert resonance for an\\nelastic hard inclusion embedded in a soft homogeneous medium in the\\nsub-wavelength regime. The quasi-Minnaert resonance consists of boundary\\nlocalization and surface resonance for the generated internal total and\\nexternal scattered wave fields associated with the hard inclusion. It possesses\\nsimilar quantitative behaviours as those for the classical Minnaert resonance\\ndue to high-contrast material structures, but occurs for a continuous spectrum\\nof frequencies instead of certain discrete Minnaert resonant frequencies. We\\npresent a comprehensive analysis to uncover the physical origin and the\\nmechanism of this new physical phenomenon. It is shown that the delicate\\nhigh-contrast material structures and the properly tailored incident waves\\nwhich are coupled together in a subtle manner play a crucial role in ensuring\\nsuch phenomena. The stress concentration phenomena in both the internal total\\nfield and the scattered field components are also rigorously established. The\\nanalysis in this paper is deeply rooted in layer potential theory and intricate\\nasymptotic analysis. We believe that our findings can have a significant impact\\non the theory of composite materials and metamaterials.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T13:42:24Z\"}"}
