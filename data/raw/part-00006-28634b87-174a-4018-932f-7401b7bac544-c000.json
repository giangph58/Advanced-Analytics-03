To the first-order\\napproximation, the normal form results in a Schr\\\\\\\"odinger-Wave system, while a\\nSchr\\\\\\\"odinger-Poisson system is derived in the limit of vanishing perturbative\\nparameter. A second-order approximation provides the successive corrections to\\nthe Schr\\\\\\\"odinger-Wave system, while higher-order approximations can be\\nobtained by iterating our constructive procedure.\", \"main_category\": \"math-ph\", \"categories\": \"math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T09:30:42Z\"}"}
