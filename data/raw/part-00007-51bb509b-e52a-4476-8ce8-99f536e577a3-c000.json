{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03196v1\", \"title\": \"A Trustworthy Multi-LLM Network: Challenges,Solutions, and A Use Case\", \"summary\": \"Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong potential across a variety of\\ntasks in communications and networking due to their advanced reasoning\\ncapabilities. However, because different LLMs have different model structures\\nand are trained using distinct corpora and methods, they may offer varying\\noptimization strategies for the same network issues. Moreover, the limitations\\nof an individual LLM's training data, aggravated by the potential maliciousness\\nof its hosting device, can result in responses with low confidence or even\\nbias. To address these challenges, we propose a blockchain-enabled\\ncollaborative framework that connects multiple LLMs into a Trustworthy\\nMulti-LLM Network (MultiLLMN). This architecture enables the cooperative\\nevaluation and selection of the most reliable and high-quality responses to\\ncomplex network optimization problems. Specifically, we begin by reviewing\\nrelated work and highlighting the limitations of existing LLMs in collaboration\\nand trust, emphasizing the need for trustworthiness in LLM-based systems. We\\nthen introduce the workflow and design of the proposed Trustworthy MultiLLMN\\nframework. Given the severity of False Base Station (FBS) attacks in B5G and 6G\\ncommunication systems and the difficulty of addressing such threats through\\ntraditional modeling techniques, we present FBS defense as a case study to\\nempirically validate the effectiveness of our approach. Finally, we outline\\npromising future research directions in this emerging area.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T05:32:46Z\"}"}
