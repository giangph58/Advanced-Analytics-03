We specifically\\nconsider pairing in two channels while deliberately excluding the third by\\nsetting its interaction strength to zero. By systematically varying the\\ninteraction strength and population imbalance, we identify a rich set of\\nspatially modulated superfluid states, including structures akin to the\\nLarkin-Ovchinnikov phase and phase-separated domains. A clear hierarchy emerges\\nin the pairing behavior, shaped by the competition between the local density of\\nstates and the Fermi momentum mismatch. A fidelity-based analysis of the\\ndensity further distinguishes smooth crossovers from sharp spatial\\nreorganizations. Our results shed light on how pairing symmetry and population\\nimbalance determine the structure of spatially inhomogeneous superfluid phases\\nin multicomponent systems with reduced dimensionality.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T11:43:56Z\"}"}
