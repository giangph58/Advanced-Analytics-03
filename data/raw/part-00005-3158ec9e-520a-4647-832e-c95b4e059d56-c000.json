In this framework, the machine learning algorithm is guided by\\nthe underlying physical laws, enabling the accurate extraction of the inverse\\nscattering potential from the elastic scattering data. Methodology: As a\\nreference potential, a combination of three smoothly joined Morse functions has\\nbeen utilized, characterized by ten model parameters. These parameters are\\noptimized in an iterative fashion using a Genetic Algorithm to ensure the best\\nfit to the phase shifts extracted from the experimental scattering data. The\\nprocess of optimization is guided by the computed scattering phase shifts by\\nsolving the phase equation using 5th order RK-method for the reference\\npotential in each iteration Results: Our approach yields inverse potentials for\\nboth single and multi channel scattering. Using the Scattering Phase Shifts\\nobtained from these inverse potentials, we calculate the partial cross-section\\nto determine the resonance energies and decay width. The obtain values of\\nresonance energies and decay width for 3D1, 3D2 and 3D3 states of\\nalpha-deuteron are in correspondence with the experimental results. Conclusion:\\nIt can be concluded that our machine learning-based approach for constructing\\nthe inverse potential offers a novel and complementary technique to existing\\ndirect methods.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:34:41Z\"}"}
