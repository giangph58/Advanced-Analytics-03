{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20936v1\", \"title\": \"Phase space of a Poisson algebra and the induced Pre-Poisson bialgebra\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we first introduce the notion of a phase space of a Poisson\\nalgebra, and show that a Poisson algebra has a phase space if and only if it is\\nsub-adjacent to a pre-Poisson algebra. Moreover, we introduce the notion of\\nManin triples of pre-Poisson algebras and show that there is a one-to-one\\ncorrespondence between Manin triples of pre-Poisson algebras and phase spaces\\nof Poisson algebras. Then we introduce the notion of pre-Poisson bialgebras,\\nwhich is equivalent to Manin triples of pre-Poisson algebras. We study\\ncoboundary pre-Poisson bialgebras, which leads to an analogue of the classical\\nYang-Baxter equation. Furthermore, we introduce the notions of quasi-triangular\\nand factorizable pre-Poisson bialgebras as special cases. A quasi-triangular\\npre-Poisson bialgebra gives rise to a relative Rota-Baxter operator of weight\\n$1$. The double of a pre-Poisson bialgebra enjoys a natural factorizable\\npre-Poisson bialgebra structure. Finally, we introduce the notion of quadratic\\nRota-Baxter pre-Poisson algebras and show that there is a one-to-one\\ncorrespondence between quadratic Rota-Baxter pre-Poisson algebras and\\nfactorizable pre-Poisson bialgebras. Based on this construction, we give a\\nphase space for a Rota-Baxter symplectic Poisson algebra.\", \"main_category\": \"math-ph\", \"categories\": \"math-ph,math.MP,math.RA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T16:58:27Z\"}"}
