{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16878v1\", \"title\": \"Situational Preparedness Dynamics for Sequential Tropical Cyclone\\n  Hazards\", \"summary\": \"Sequential tropical cyclone hazards--two tropical cyclones (TCs) making\\nlandfall in the same region within a short time--are becoming increasingly\\nlikely. This study investigates situational preparedness dynamics for six\\nsequential TC events that affected seven states in the United States from 2020\\nto 2024. We find a combined effect of forecast wind speed and landfall sequence\\nof a TC. Stronger forecast wind is always associated with higher preparedness\\nlevels. People tend to show a higher preparedness level for the second TC but\\nare more sensitive to the increasing forecast wind speed of the first TC. We\\nalso find that the counties showing high preparedness levels for the first TC\\nconsistently show high preparedness levels for the subsequent one. Power\\noutages induced by the first TC significantly increase preparedness for the\\nsubsequent TC (e.g., approximately 13% pct for mobility needs preparedness and\\n24% for structural reinforcement preparedness when increasing one-unit\\ncustomers out). We identified spatial dependency in preparedness across\\ncounties. Power outage experiences in first TCs show statistically significant\\nspillover effects on neighboring counties' preparedness levels for second TCs.\\nThroughout sequential TCs, people with access and functional needs consistently\\nshow lower preparedness levels.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T16:54:22Z\"}"}
