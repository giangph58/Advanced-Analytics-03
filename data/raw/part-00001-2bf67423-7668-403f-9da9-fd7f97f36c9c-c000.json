However, recording raw data from\\nnumerous neurons results in substantial amount of data and poses challenges for\\nwireless transmission. While conventional neural recorders consume energy to\\ndigitize and process the full neural signal, only a fraction of this data\\ncarries essential spiking information. Leveraging on this signal sparsity, this\\npaper introduces a neural recording integrated circuit in TSMC 28nm CMOS. It\\nfeatures an event-driven ramp analog-to-digital converter, and a spike\\ncompression module based on principal component analysis. The circuit consists\\nof 49 channels, each occupying an on-chip area of 50 $\\\\times$ 60 $\\\\mu$m$^2$.\\nThe circuit measures 1370 $\\\\times$ 1370 $\\\\mu$m$^2$ and consumes 534 $\\\\mu$W.\\nCompression testing on a synthetic dataset demonstrated an 8.8-fold reduction\\ncompared to raw spikes and a 328-fold reduction relative to the raw signal.\\nThis compression approach maintained a spike sorting accuracy of 74.9%,\\ncompared to the 79.5% accuracy obtained with the raw signal. The paper details\\nthe architecture and performance outcomes of the neural recording circuit and\\nits compression module.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T04:59:39Z\"}"}
