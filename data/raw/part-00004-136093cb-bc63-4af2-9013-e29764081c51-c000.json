Our quantitative\\nmeasurements indicate an immediate increase in such cyberattacks following the\\nHamas-led assault and the subsequent declaration of war. However, the surges\\nwaned quickly after a few weeks, with patterns resembling those observed in the\\naftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The scale of attacks and\\ndiscussions within the hacking community this time was both significantly lower\\nthan those during the early days of the Russia-Ukraine war, and attacks have\\nbeen prominently one-sided: many pro-Palestinian supporters have targeted\\nIsrael, while attacks on Palestine have been much less significant. Beyond\\ntargeting these two, attackers also defaced sites of other countries to express\\ntheir war support. Their broader opinions are also largely disparate, with far\\nmore support for Palestine and many objections expressed toward Israel.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T05:13:54Z\"}"}
