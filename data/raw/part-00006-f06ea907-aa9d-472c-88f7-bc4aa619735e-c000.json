Here we report the coexistence of\\nferroelectricity and ferromagnetism at 780 K and a strong ME coupling with a\\nconverse ME coupling coefficient up to 498 ps/m at room-temperature in\\nstrontium titanate by dedicated vacancy engineering. The asymmetric\\ndistribution of oxygen vacancies surrounding titanium vacancies enables atomic\\ndisplacement of titanium and charge injection, providing joint origin for\\nferroelectricity and ferromagnetism, as confirmed by atomic-scale structural\\nanalysis and first-principles calculations. The mechanism of ME coupling is\\noffered as the hopping of oxygen vacancies under electric fields, which leads\\nto the rearrangement of electronic configuration. Our work opens an avenue for\\ndesigning multiferroics, overcoming the long-standing scarcity of\\nroom-temperature single-phase multiferroics.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T13:42:37Z\"}"}
