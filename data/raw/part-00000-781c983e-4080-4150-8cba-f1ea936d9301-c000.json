{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16930v1\", \"title\": \"Procedural Dataset Generation for Zero-Shot Stereo Matching\", \"summary\": \"Synthetic datasets are a crucial ingredient for training stereo matching\\nnetworks, but the question of what makes a stereo dataset effective remains\\nlargely unexplored. We investigate the design space of synthetic datasets by\\nvarying the parameters of a procedural dataset generator, and report the\\neffects on zero-shot stereo matching performance using standard benchmarks. We\\ncollect the best settings to produce Infinigen-Stereo, a procedural generator\\nspecifically optimized for zero-shot stereo datasets. Models trained only on\\ndata from our system outperform robust baselines trained on a combination of\\nexisting synthetic datasets and have stronger zero-shot stereo matching\\nperformance than public checkpoints from prior works. We open source our system\\nat https://github.com/princeton-vl/InfinigenStereo to enable further research\\non procedural stereo datasets.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T17:59:33Z\"}"}
