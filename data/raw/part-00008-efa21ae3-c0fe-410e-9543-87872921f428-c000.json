For fermionic fields in curved spacetime, spin\\nconnections maintain gravitational consistency. This framework, applicable to\\nhigh-energy physics, black hole thermodynamics, and cosmology, integrates\\nquantum gravity into relativistic field theories.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T17:10:40Z\"}"}
