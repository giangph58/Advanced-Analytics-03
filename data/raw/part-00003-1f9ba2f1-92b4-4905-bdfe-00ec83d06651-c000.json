Our method\\naddresses key challenges in MeV gamma-ray astronomy by incorporating Bayesian\\npriors for sparseness and smoothness while optimizing background components\\nsimultaneously. We introduce a novel sparsity term suitable for Poisson-sampled\\ndata in addition to a smoothness prior, allowing for flexible reconstruction of\\nboth point sources and extended emission. The performance of the algorithm is\\nevaluated using simulated three-month COSI observations of gamma-ray lines of\\n$^{44}$Ti (1.157 MeV), $^{26}$Al (1.809 MeV), and positron annihilation (0.511\\nMeV), respectively, representing various spatial features. Our results\\ndemonstrate significant improvements over conventional RL methods, particularly\\nin suppressing artificial structures in point source reconstructions and\\nretaining diffuse spatial structures. This work represents an important step\\ntowards establishing a robust data analysis for studying nucleosynthesis,\\npositron annihilation, and other high-energy phenomena in our Galaxy.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T10:39:16Z\"}"}
