{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05114v1\", \"title\": \"Listen to Extract: Onset-Prompted Target Speaker Extraction\", \"summary\": \"We propose $\\\\textit{listen to extract}$ (LExt), a highly-effective while\\nextremely-simple algorithm for monaural target speaker extraction (TSE). Given\\nan enrollment utterance of a target speaker, LExt aims at extracting the target\\nspeaker from the speaker's mixed speech with other speakers. For each mixture,\\nLExt concatenates an enrollment utterance of the target speaker to the mixture\\nsignal at the waveform level, and trains deep neural networks (DNN) to extract\\nthe target speech based on the concatenated mixture signal. The rationale is\\nthat, this way, an artificial speech onset is created for the target speaker\\nand it could prompt the DNN (a) which speaker is the target to extract; and (b)\\nspectral-temporal patterns of the target speaker that could help extraction.\\nThis simple approach produces strong TSE performance on multiple public TSE\\ndatasets including WSJ0-2mix, WHAM! and WHAMR!.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.AS\", \"categories\": \"eess.AS,cs.SD\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T10:30:47Z\"}"}
