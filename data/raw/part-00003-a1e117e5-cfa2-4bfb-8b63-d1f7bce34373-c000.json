The Bolza problem from optimal control theory is applied\\nto these systems and a hybrid version of Pontryagin's maximum principle is\\npresented. This hybrid maximum principle is presented to emphasize its\\ngeometric nature which makes its study amenable to the tools of geometric\\nmechanics and symplectic geometry. One explicit benefit of this geometric\\napproach is that the symplectic structure (and hence the induced volume) is\\npreserved. This allows for a hybrid analog of caustics and conjugate points.\\nAdditionally, an introductory analysis of singular solutions (beating and Zeno)\\nis discussed geometrically. This work concludes on a biological example where\\nbeating can occur.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T14:13:15Z\"}"}
