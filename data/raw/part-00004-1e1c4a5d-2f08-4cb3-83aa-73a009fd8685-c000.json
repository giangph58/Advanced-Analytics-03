Analysis of such event time data can be\\nbiased if left-truncation is not handled properly. We propose a semiparametric\\nsieve likelihood approach for fitting a linear regression model to data where\\nthe response variable is subject to both left-truncation and right-censoring.\\nWe show that the estimators of regression coefficients are consistent,\\nasymptotically normal and semiparametrically efficient. Extensive simulation\\nstudies show the effectiveness of the method across a wide variety of error\\ndistributions. We further illustrate the method by analyzing a dataset from The\\n90+ Study for aging and dementia.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T03:08:50Z\"}"}
