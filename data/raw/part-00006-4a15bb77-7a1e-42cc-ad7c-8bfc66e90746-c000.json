{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02364v1\", \"title\": \"SProBench: Stream Processing Benchmark for High Performance Computing\\n  Infrastructure\", \"summary\": \"Recent advancements in data stream processing frameworks have improved\\nreal-time data handling, however, scalability remains a significant challenge\\naffecting throughput and latency. While studies have explored this issue on\\nlocal machines and cloud clusters, research on modern high performance\\ncomputing (HPC) infrastructures is yet limited due to the lack of scalable\\nmeasurement tools. This work presents SProBench, a novel benchmark suite\\ndesigned to evaluate the performance of data stream processing frameworks in\\nlarge-scale computing systems. Building on best practices, SProBench\\nincorporates a modular architecture, offers native support for SLURM-based\\nclusters, and seamlessly integrates with popular stream processing frameworks\\nsuch as Apache Flink, Apache Spark Streaming, and Apache Kafka Streams.\\nExperiments conducted on HPC clusters demonstrate its exceptional scalability,\\ndelivering throughput that surpasses existing benchmarks by more than tenfold.\\nThe distinctive features of SProBench, including complete customization\\noptions, built-in automated experiment management tools, seamless\\ninteroperability, and an open-source license, distinguish it as an innovative\\nbenchmark suite tailored to meet the needs of modern data stream processing\\nframeworks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC,cs.PF\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T07:54:49Z\"}"}
