{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10066v1\", \"title\": \"A Framework for Adaptive Load Redistribution in Human-Exoskeleton-Cobot\\n  Systems\", \"summary\": \"Wearable devices like exoskeletons are designed to reduce excessive loads on\\nspecific joints of the body. Specifically, single- or two-degrees-of-freedom\\n(DOF) upper-body industrial exoskeletons typically focus on compensating for\\nthe strain on the elbow and shoulder joints. However, during daily activities,\\nthere is no assurance that external loads are correctly aligned with the\\nsupported joints. Optimizing work processes to ensure that external loads are\\nprimarily (to the extent that they can be compensated by the exoskeleton)\\ndirected onto the supported joints can significantly enhance the overall\\nusability of these devices and the ergonomics of their users. Collaborative\\nrobots (cobots) can play a role in this optimization, complementing the\\ncollaborative aspects of human work. In this study, we propose an adaptive and\\ncoordinated control system for the human-cobot-exoskeleton interaction. This\\nsystem adjusts the task coordinates to maximize the utilization of the\\nsupported joints. When the torque limits of the exoskeleton are exceeded, the\\nframework continuously adapts the task frame, redistributing excessive loads to\\nnon-supported body joints to prevent overloading the supported ones. We\\nvalidated our approach in an equivalent industrial painting task involving a\\nsingle-DOF elbow exoskeleton, a cobot, and four subjects, each tested in four\\ndifferent initial arm configurations with five distinct optimisation weight\\nmatrices and two different payloads.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T10:09:00Z\"}"}
