{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23827v1\", \"title\": \"Aud-Sur: An Audio Analyzer Assistant for Audio Surveillance Applications\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we present an audio analyzer assistant tool designed for a\\nwide range of audio-based surveillance applications (This work is a part of our\\nDEFAME FAKES and EUCINF projects). The proposed tool, refered to as Aud-Sur,\\ncomprises two main phases Audio Analysis and Audio Retrieval, respectively. In\\nthe first phase, multiple open-source audio models are leveraged to extract\\ninformation from input audio recording uploaded by a user. In the second phase,\\nusers interact with the Aud-Sur tool via a natural question-and-answer manner,\\npowered by a large language model (LLM), to retrieve the information extracted\\nfrom the processed audio file. The Aud-Sur tool was deployed using Docker on a\\nmicroservices-based architecture design. By leveraging open-source audio models\\nfor information extraction, LLM for audio information retrieval, and a\\nmicroservices-based deployment approach, the proposed Aud-Sur tool offers a\\nhighly extensible and adaptable framework that can integrate more audio tasks,\\nand be widely shared within the audio community for further development.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.AS\", \"categories\": \"eess.AS\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T08:21:11Z\"}"}
