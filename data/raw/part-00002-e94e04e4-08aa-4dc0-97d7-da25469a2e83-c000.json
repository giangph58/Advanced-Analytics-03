{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19568v1\", \"title\": \"How rigidity percolation and bending stiffness shape colloidal gel\\n  elasticity\", \"summary\": \"Dispersed colloidal particles within a suspension can aggregate and\\nspontaneously self-organize into a robust, percolating structure known as a\\ngel. These network-like structures are prevalent in nature and play a critical\\nrole in many industrial processes, including those involving batteries, food\\nproducts, and pharmaceutical formulations. In this paper, we examine the\\nemergence of elasticity in colloidal gels. We show that gelation is governed by\\na rigidity percolation transition. We identify a characteristic correlation\\nlength that quantifies the extent of elastic and structural inhomogeneities,\\nwhich diverges at the critical point. Our findings reveal that, regardless of\\nthe interaction types, the particle concentration, or the specific route to\\nnon-ergodicity i.e. the preparation protocol, the elastic moduli and\\nvibrational properties of gels can be accurately predicted within a unifying\\nframework, in which the bending modes of fractal clusters -- approximately the\\nsize of this correlation length -- dominate under small deformations.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T08:23:55Z\"}"}
