KDM applies to general\\nprobability measures on countably generated measurable spaces without\\nrestrictive assumptions on continuity, or the existence of a Lebesgue density.\\nFor computational efficiency, we incorporate a low-rank approximation with\\nprecisely controlled error that grants scalability to large-sample settings. We\\nprovide rigorous theoretical guarantees, including asymptotic consistency, a\\nfunctional central limit theorem, and finite-sample error bounds, establishing\\na strong foundation for practical use. Empirical results based on simulated and\\nreal data demonstrate the efficacy and precision of KDM.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ML\", \"categories\": \"stat.ML,cs.LG,math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T08:25:25Z\"}"}
