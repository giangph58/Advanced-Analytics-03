{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11868v1\", \"title\": \"Real-Time Shape Estimation of Tensegrity Structures Using Strut\\n  Inclination Angles\", \"summary\": \"Tensegrity structures are becoming widely used in robotics, such as\\ncontinuously bending soft manipulators and mobile robots to explore unknown and\\nuneven environments dynamically. Estimating their shape, which is the\\nfoundation of their state, is essential for establishing control. However,\\non-board sensor-based shape estimation remains difficult despite its\\nimportance, because tensegrity structures lack well-defined joints, which makes\\nit challenging to use conventional angle sensors such as potentiometers or\\nencoders for shape estimation. To our knowledge, no existing work has\\nsuccessfully achieved shape estimation using only onboard sensors such as\\nInertial Measurement Units (IMUs). This study addresses this issue by proposing\\na novel approach that uses energy minimization to estimate the shape. We\\nvalidated our method through experiments on a simple Class 1 tensegrity\\nstructure, and the results show that the proposed algorithm can estimate the\\nreal-time shape of the structure using onboard sensors, even in the presence of\\nexternal disturbances.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T08:44:06Z\"}"}
