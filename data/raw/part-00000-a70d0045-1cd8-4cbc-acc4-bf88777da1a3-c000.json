{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07653v1\", \"title\": \"Optimum design of permeable diffractive lenses based on photon sieves\", \"summary\": \"Photon sieves are permeable diffractive optical elements generated by open\\napertures on a substrate. These elements are well suited for the monitoring of\\nrunning fluids. Our analysis considers the fabrication constrains of the photon\\nsieve and translate them into values of the optical parameters of the element.\\nWhen used as focusing elements, or diffractive lenses, the spatial distribution\\nof apertures can be designed to maximize the intensity at the focal plane and\\nthe permeability of the device. This is done by defining a weighted merit\\nfunction. The computation time of this merit function is key when applying\\ndifferent strategies for the design, which often require a very large number of\\ncalculations of this merit function. Then, besides using a reliable propagation\\nmethod, we have included an analytic solution applicable for circular\\napertures. Also, a geometrical merit function is proposed to simplify and\\nreduce the computation even more. The methods proposed in this contribution are\\ncompared in terms of the focused irradiance and permeability parameters,\\nallowing an educated choice adapted to the given case or application. In this\\ncontribution we analyze several methods to generate photon sieves in an optimum\\nmanner. The resulted spatial distributions resemble the classical Fresnel zone\\narrangement.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T11:00:25Z\"}"}
