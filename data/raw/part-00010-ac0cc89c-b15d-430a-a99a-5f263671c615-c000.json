Existing test procedures\\nperform not well under dense alternatives. To address this critical issue, we\\nintroduce a novel quadratic-type test statistic which can efficiently detect\\ndense alternative hypotheses. We further propose an adaptive test procedure to\\nremain powerful under both sparse and dense alternative hypotheses.\\nTheoretically, under the null hypothesis, we establish the asymptotic normality\\nof the proposed quadratic-type test statistic and asymptotic independence of\\nthe newly introduced quadratic-type test statistic and a maximum-type test\\nstatistic. We also prove that our adaptive test procedure is powerful to detect\\nsignals under either sparse or dense alternative hypotheses. Simulation studies\\nand an application to an FRED-MD macroeconomics dataset are carried out to\\nillustrate the merits of our introduced procedures.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T07:34:23Z\"}"}
