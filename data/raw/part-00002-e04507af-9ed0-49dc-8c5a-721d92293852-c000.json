However, smaller\\nmunicipalities often face data limitations that hinder tailored climate\\nstrategies. This study generates detailed final energy consumption and\\nemissions data at the local administrative level for Germany and Spain. Using\\nnational datasets, we apply spatial disaggregation techniques with open data\\nsources. A key innovation is the application of XGBoost for imputing missing\\ndata, combined with a stepwise spatial disaggregation process incorporating\\ndistrict- and province-level statistics. Prioritizing reproducibility, our\\nopen-data approach provides a scalable framework for municipalities to develop\\nactionable climate plans. To ensure transparency, we assess the reliability of\\nimputed values and assign confidence ratings to the disaggregated data.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DB\", \"categories\": \"cs.DB,E.m\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T11:21:44Z\"}"}
