This paper discusses a comprehensive\\nprovenance framework combining the two types 1. workflow provenance, and 2.\\ndata provenance as well as their dimensions and granularity, which enables the\\nanswering of W7+1 provenance questions. We demonstrate the applicability by\\nemploying a biomedical research use case, that can be easily transferred into\\nother scientific fields. An integration of these concepts into a unified\\nframework enables credibility and reproducibility of the research findings.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DB\", \"categories\": \"cs.DB\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:18:22Z\"}"}
