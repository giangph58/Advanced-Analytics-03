In particular, we propose applying the NR-SSOR as the inner iteration\\nright preconditioner, which also works efficiently for least squares problems $\\n\\\\min_{x \\\\in R^n} \\\\| b - A x\\\\|_2 $ for $ A \\\\in R^{m \\\\times n} $ and arbitrary $\\nb \\\\in R^m $.\\n  Numerical experiments demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T05:34:02Z\"}"}
