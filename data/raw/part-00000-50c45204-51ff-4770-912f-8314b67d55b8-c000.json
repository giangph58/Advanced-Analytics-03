In this way, the array is seen as a sequence\\nof sequences. Such an array is said to be row exchangeable if each row is an\\nexchangeable sequence, and the entire array, viewed as a sequence of sequences,\\nis exchangeable. We give a representation theorem, analogous to those of Aldous\\nand Hoover, which characterizes row exchangeable arrays. We then use this\\nrepresentation theorem to address the problem of performing Bayesian inference\\non row exchangeable arrays.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T12:44:26Z\"}"}
