Although recently substantial progress has been made in scaled graph\\nanalysis, at present their use in multivariable feedback systems is limited by\\nconservatism. In this paper, we aim to reduce this conservatism by introducing\\nmultipliers and exploit system structure in the analysis with scaled graphs. In\\nparticular, we use weighted inner products to arrive at a weighted scaled graph\\nand combine this with a commutation property to formulate a stability result\\nfor multivariable feedback systems. We present a method for computing the\\nweighted scaled graph of Lur'e systems based on solving sets of linear matrix\\ninequalities, and demonstrate a significant reduction in conservatism through\\nan example.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T11:46:22Z\"}"}
