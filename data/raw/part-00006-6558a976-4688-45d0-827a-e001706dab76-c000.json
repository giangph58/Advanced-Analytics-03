{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15008v1\", \"title\": \"New horizon in particle physics: First observation of CP violation in\\n  baryon decays\", \"summary\": \"Recently, the LHCb Collaboration achieved the observation of CP violation\\n(CPV) in baryon decays through the process of $\\\\Lambda_b^0\\\\to pK^-\\\\pi^+\\\\pi^-$,\\nreporting an asymmetry of $(2.45\\\\pm0.46\\\\pm0.10)\\\\%$ with a significance of\\n5.2$\\\\sigma$. This marks a breakthrough and a milestone in particle physics, six\\ndecades after the first observation of CPV in mesons. It will be helpful to\\nunderstand the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. In addition to the\\nglobal CPV, local CPV is also observed by LHCb in the low mass region of\\n$m_{p\\\\pi^+\\\\pi^-}<2.7$GeV as $(5.4\\\\pm0.9\\\\pm0.1)\\\\%$ with a significance of\\n6.0$\\\\sigma$. Intriguingly, this measurement aligns well with a theoretical\\nprediction of $(5.6-5.9)\\\\%$ based on a CPV dynamics using the data of $N\\\\pi\\\\to\\np\\\\pi^+\\\\pi^-$ scatterings. Since baryons contain one more quark than mesons, the\\ndynamics of baryon decays are significantly different from those of mesons.\\nTherefore, the first observation of baryon CPV by LHCb opens a new horizon in\\nthe studies of dynamics of the strong interaction.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T10:16:40Z\"}"}
