{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03608v1\", \"title\": \"Keeping the relation between the Starobinsky model and no-scale\\n  supergravity ACTive\", \"summary\": \"We introduce a modification of the Starobinsky model in the form of an\\nadditional cubic Ricci scalar curvature term $\\\\sim \\\\alpha R^3$, scaled by a\\ndimensionless parameter $\\\\alpha$, with the resulting inflaton potential being\\nthe standard Starobinsky potential modified to first parametric order by an\\nadditive term. The resulting potential is identical to the potential obtained\\nby a modification of the superpotential employed in the construction of the\\nStarobinsky model in the framework of no-scale supergravity, thus, extending\\nthe correspondence between a class of no-scale supergravity models and\\nmodifications of the Starobinsky model. We analyze the inflationary predictions\\nof the model and find that for $-4.2 \\\\times 10^{-5} \\\\lesssim \\\\alpha \\\\lesssim\\n-1.9 \\\\times 10^{-5}$, the modified Starobinsky model is in full agreement with\\nthe recent observational data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, for a range\\nof $e$-folds, $N_\\\\star = 50-60$.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.CO,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:07:31Z\"}"}
