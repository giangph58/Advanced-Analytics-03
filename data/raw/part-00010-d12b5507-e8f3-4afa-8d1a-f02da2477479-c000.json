The context\\nitself can be static (lanes, regulatory elements, etc) or dynamic (traffic\\nparticipants). This paper presents a lane graph-based motion prediction model\\nthat first predicts graph-based goal proposals and later fuses them with cross\\nattention over multiple contextual elements. We follow the famous\\nencoder-interactor-decoder architecture where the encoder encodes scene context\\nusing lightweight Gated Recurrent Units, the interactor applies cross-context\\nattention over encoded scene features and graph goal proposals, and the decoder\\nregresses multimodal trajectories via Laplacian Mixture Density Network from\\nthe aggregated encodings. Using cross-attention over graph-based goal proposals\\ngives robust trajectory estimates since the model learns to attend to future\\ngoal-relevant scene elements for the intended agent. We evaluate our work on\\nnuScenes motion prediction dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T12:53:07Z\"}"}
