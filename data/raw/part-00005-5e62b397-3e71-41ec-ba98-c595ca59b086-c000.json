{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17370v1\", \"title\": \"Doubly Adaptive Social Learning\", \"summary\": \"In social learning, a network of agents assigns probability scores (beliefs)\\nto some hypotheses of interest, which rule the generation of local streaming\\ndata observed by each agent. Belief formation takes place by means of an\\niterative two-step procedure where: i) the agents update locally their beliefs\\nby using some likelihood model; and ii) the updated beliefs are combined with\\nthe beliefs of the neighboring agents, using a pooling rule. This procedure can\\nfail to perform well in the presence of dynamic drifts, leading the agents to\\nincorrect decision making. Here, we focus on the fully online setting where\\nboth the true hypothesis and the likelihood models can change over time. We\\npropose the doubly adaptive social learning ($\\\\text{A}^2\\\\text{SL}$) strategy,\\nwhich infuses social learning with the necessary adaptation capabilities. This\\ngoal is achieved by exploiting two adaptation stages: i) a stochastic gradient\\ndescent update to learn and track the drifts in the decision model; ii) and an\\nadaptive belief update to track the true hypothesis changing over time. These\\nstages are controlled by two adaptation parameters that govern the evolution of\\nthe error probability for each agent. We show that all agents learn\\nconsistently for sufficiently small adaptation parameters, in the sense that\\nthey ultimately place all their belief mass on the true hypothesis. In\\nparticular, the probability of choosing the wrong hypothesis converges to\\nvalues on the order of the adaptation parameters. The theoretical analysis is\\nillustrated both on synthetic data and by applying the $\\\\text{A}^2\\\\text{SL}$\\nstrategy to a social learning problem in the online setting using real data.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T08:43:09Z\"}"}
