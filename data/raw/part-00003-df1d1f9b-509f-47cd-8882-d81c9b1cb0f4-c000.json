Dissipation of tidal flows in Earth's\\noceans is primarily responsible for producing gradual expansion of the Moon's\\norbit at a few centimetres per year as the Earth's day lengthens by a few\\nmilliseconds per century. Similar processes occur in many astrophysical\\nsystems. For example, tidal dissipation inside (slowly rotating) stars hosting\\nshort-period planets can cause the orbits of these planets to decay,\\npotentially leading to planetary destruction; tidal dissipation inside stars in\\nclose stellar binary systems -- and inside short-period planets such as hot\\nJupiters in planetary systems -- can cause initially eccentric orbits to become\\ncircular. To model these processes, explain many current observational results,\\nand make predictions for future observations, we require a detailed theoretical\\nunderstanding of tidal flows and the mechanisms by which -- and how efficiently\\n-- they are dissipated inside stars and planets. This article will introduce\\nour current understanding of tidal flows and dissipation inside stars (and to a\\nlesser extent giant planets), as well as highlight some unsolved problems.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T07:41:32Z\"}"}
