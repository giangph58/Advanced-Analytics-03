{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07505v1\", \"title\": \"$c$-Birkhoff polytopes\", \"summary\": \"In a 2018 paper, Davis and Sagan studied several pattern-avoiding polytopes.\\nThey found that a particular pattern-avoiding Birkhoff polytope had the same\\nnormalized volume as the order polytope of a certain poset, leading them to ask\\nif the two polytopes were unimodularly equivalent. Motivated by Davis and\\nSagan's question, in this paper we define a pattern-avoiding Birkhoff polytope\\ncalled a $c$-Birkhoff polytope for each Coxeter element $c$ of the symmetric\\ngroup. We then show that the $c$-Birkhoff polytope is unimodularly equivalent\\nto the order polytope of the heap poset of the $c$-sorting word of the longest\\npermutation. When $c=s_1s_2\\\\dots s_{n}$, this result recovers an affirmative\\nanswer to Davis and Sagan's question. Another consequence of this result is\\nthat the normalized volume of the $c$-Birkhoff polytope is the number of the\\nlongest chains in the (type A) $c$-Cambrian lattice.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T07:05:41Z\"}"}
