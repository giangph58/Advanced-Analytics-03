To this end, it leverages information about variable dependencies and the\\nsubfunction-based problem representation. These approaches were already shown\\neffective by enabling \\\\textit{tunnelling} between local optima even if these\\nmoves require the modification of many dependent variables. Tunnelling is\\nuseful in solving the maximum satisfiability problem (MaxSat), which can be\\nreformulated to Max3Sat. Since many real-world problems can be brought to\\nsolving the MaxSat/Max3Sat instances, it is important to solve them effectively\\nand efficiently. Therefore, we focus on Max3Sat instances for which tunnelling\\nfails to introduce improving moves between locally optimal high-quality\\nsolutions and the region of globally optimal solutions. We analyze the features\\nof such instances on the ground of phase transitions. Based on these\\nobservations, we propose manipulating clause-satisfiability characteristics\\nthat allow connecting high-quality solutions distant in the solution space. We\\nutilize multi-satisfiability characteristics in the optimizer built from\\ntypical gray-box mechanisms. The experimental study shows that the proposed\\noptimizer can solve those Max3Sat instances that are out of the grasp of\\nstate-of-the-art gray-box optimizers. At the same time, it remains effective\\nfor instances that have already been successfully solved by gray-box.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T08:38:08Z\"}"}
