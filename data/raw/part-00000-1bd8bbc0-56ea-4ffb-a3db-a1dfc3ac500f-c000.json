{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04089v1\", \"title\": \"A New Scope and Domain Measure Comparison Method for Global Convergence\\n  Analysis in Evolutionary Computation\", \"summary\": \"Convergence analysis is a fundamental research topic in evolutionary\\ncomputation (EC). The commonly used analysis method models the EC algorithm as\\na homogeneous Markov chain for analysis, which is not always suitable for\\ndifferent EC variants, and also sometimes causes misuse and confusion due to\\ntheir complex process. In this article, we categorize the existing researches\\non convergence analysis in EC algorithms into stable convergence and global\\nconvergence, and then prove that the conditions for these two convergence\\nproperties are somehow mutually exclusive. Inspired by this proof, we propose a\\nnew scope and domain measure comparison (SDMC) method for analyzing the global\\nconvergence of EC algorithms and provide a rigorous proof of its necessity and\\nsufficiency as an alternative condition. Unlike traditional methods, the SDMC\\nmethod is straightforward, bypasses Markov chain modeling, and minimizes errors\\nfrom misapplication as it only focuses on the measure of the algorithm's search\\nscope. We apply SDMC to two algorithm types that are unsuitable for traditional\\nmethods, confirming its effectiveness in global convergence analysis.\\nFurthermore, we apply the SDMC method to explore the gene targeting mechanism's\\nimpact on the global convergence in large-scale global optimization, deriving\\ninsights into how to design EC algorithms that guarantee global convergence and\\nexploring how theoretical analysis can guide EC algorithm design.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NE\", \"categories\": \"cs.NE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T03:04:18Z\"}"}
