{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07058v1\", \"title\": \"Physics informed neural network for forward and inverse modeling of low\\n  grade brain tumors\", \"summary\": \"A low grade tumor is a slow growing tumor with a lower likelihood of\\nspreading compared to high grade tumors. Mathematical modeling using partial\\ndifferential equations (PDEs) plays a crucial role in describing tumor\\nbehavior, growth and progression. This study employs the Burgess and extended\\nFisher Kolmogorov equations to model low-grade brain tumors. We utilize Physics\\nInformed Neural Networks (PINNs) based algorithm to develop an automated\\nnumerical solver for these models and explore their application in solving\\nforward and inverse problems in brain tumor modeling. The study aims to\\ndemonstrate that the PINN based algorithms serve as advanced methodologies for\\nmodeling brain tumor dynamics by integrating deep learning with\\nphysics-informed principles. Additionally, we establish generalized error\\nbounds in terms of training and quadrature errors. The convergence and\\nstability of the neural network are derived for both models. Numerical tests\\nconfirm the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithms in both linear and\\nnonlinear cases. Additionally, a statistical analysis of the numerical results\\nis presented.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T17:20:06Z\"}"}
