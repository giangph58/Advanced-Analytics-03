{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03236v1\", \"title\": \"The long-term optical flux variations of Compact Symmetric Objects\", \"summary\": \"Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) are a distinct category of jetted active\\ngalactic nuclei (AGN) whose optical variability characteristics have not been\\nwell investigated. We present here the results of our investigation on the\\noptical flux and colour variability properties of a bona fide sample of 38\\nCSOs. We used the g-, r- and i-bands data from the Zwicky Transient Facility\\nsurvey that spans a duration of about 5 years. We also considered a comparison\\nsub-sample of blazars that includes 5 flat spectrum radio quasars and 12 BL Lac\\nobjects with redshifts and g-band magnitudes similar to the limited sub-sample\\nof 9 CSOs. These two sub-samples of AGN, chosen for this comparative study of\\ntheir long-term optical variability, represent different orientations of their\\nrelativistic jets with respect to the observer. We found that both CSOs and\\nblazars exhibit optical flux variations, although variability of CSOs is lower\\nthan that of blazars. The observed variability in both CSOs and blazars is\\nattributed to the relativistic jets and the increased optical variations in\\nblazars relative to CSOs are likely due to beaming effects. CSOs and blazars\\nexhibit similar colour variations, with both of them showing a bluer when\\nbrighter trend. Such a colour variability pattern is expected due to processes\\nassociated with their relativistic jets.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T07:04:11Z\"}"}
