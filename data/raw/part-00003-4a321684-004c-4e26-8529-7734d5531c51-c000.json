{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15130v1\", \"title\": \"Neural ATTF: A Scalable Solution to Lifelong Multi-Agent Path Planning\", \"summary\": \"Multi-Agent Pickup and Delivery (MAPD) is a fundamental problem in robotics,\\nparticularly in applications such as warehouse automation and logistics.\\nExisting solutions often face challenges in scalability, adaptability, and\\nefficiency, limiting their applicability in dynamic environments with real-time\\nplanning requirements. This paper presents Neural ATTF (Adaptive Task Token\\nFramework), a new algorithm that combines a Priority Guided Task Matching\\n(PGTM) Module with Neural STA* (Space-Time A*), a data-driven path planning\\nmethod. Neural STA* enhances path planning by enabling rapid exploration of the\\nsearch space through guided learned heuristics and ensures collision avoidance\\nunder dynamic constraints. PGTM prioritizes delayed agents and dynamically\\nassigns tasks by prioritizing agents nearest to these tasks, optimizing both\\ncontinuity and system throughput. Experimental evaluations against\\nstate-of-the-art MAPD algorithms, including TPTS, CENTRAL, RMCA, LNS-PBS, and\\nLNS-wPBS, demonstrate the superior scalability, solution quality, and\\ncomputational efficiency of Neural ATTF. These results highlight the\\nframework's potential for addressing the critical demands of complex,\\nreal-world multi-agent systems operating in high-demand, unpredictable\\nsettings.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T14:25:32Z\"}"}
