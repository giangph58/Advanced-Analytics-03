The method is\\npresented for both constant- and variable-order operators, in either integral\\nor differential forms. Several numerical examples are presented in order to\\nvalidate the theory against analytical results and to evaluate the performance\\nof the methodology. This formalism paves the way for the solution of\\nfractional-order continuum mechanics models via the SPH method.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T11:55:12Z\"}"}
