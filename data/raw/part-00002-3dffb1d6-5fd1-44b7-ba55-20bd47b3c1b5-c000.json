Machine learning interatomic potentials\\n(MLIPs) offer an efficient and scalable alternative to quantum mechanical\\nmethods but do not by themselves incorporate electrical response. Here, we show\\nthat polarization and Born effective charge (BEC) tensors can be directly\\nextracted from long-range MLIPs within the Latent Ewald Summation (LES)\\nframework, solely by learning from energy and force data. Using this approach,\\nwe predict the infrared spectra of bulk water under zero or finite external\\nelectric fields, ionic conductivities of high-pressure superionic ice, and the\\nphase transition and hysteresis in ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$ perovskite. This\\nwork thus extends the capability of MLIPs to predict electrical\\nresponse--without training on charges or polarization or BECs--and enables\\naccurate modeling of electric-field-driven processes in diverse systems at\\nscale.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cs.LG,physics.chem-ph,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T15:14:07Z\"}"}
