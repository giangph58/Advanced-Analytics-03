{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05133v1\", \"title\": \"Control and Transient Spectroscopy of Engineered Spin-Cavity Back-Action\", \"summary\": \"We present an experimental arrangement that permits engineering of cavity\\nback-action on a mesoscopic spin ensemble. By coupling a superconducting\\nthin-film Nb microstrip resonator to a Trityl OX63 electron spin sample, we\\naccess different regimes of spin-cavity dynamics by designing the ensemble\\nsize, effective coupling strength, cavity temperature, and spin saturation. We\\nperformed transient spectroscopy measurements under continuous microwave drive\\nin the strong radiation damping regime. These measurements exhibit a long-lived\\nplateau response that distinguishes important features of spin-cavity models,\\nsuch as the radiation damping Bloch equations and Maxwell-Bloch equations. We\\ndemonstrate control of the plateau response through adjustment of temperature,\\nmicrowave drive power, and variable spin saturation. The presented experimental\\narrangement serves as a robust system to explore the space of spin-cavity\\ndynamics and develop new quantum devices that harness the complexity of\\nmesoscopic spin ensembles coherently interacting with high quality factor\\ncavities.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.mes-hall,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:36:45Z\"}"}
