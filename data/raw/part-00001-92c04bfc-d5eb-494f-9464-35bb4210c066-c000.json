{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04114v1\", \"title\": \"UX-aware Rate Allocation for Real-Time Media\", \"summary\": \"Immersive communications is a key use case for 6G where applications require\\nreliable latency-bound media traffic at a certain data rate to deliver an\\nacceptable User Experience (UX) or Quality-of-Experience (QoE). The\\nQuality-of-Service (QoS) framework of current cellular systems (4G and 5G) and\\nprevalent network congestion control algorithms for latency-bound traffic like\\nL4S typically target network-related Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as\\ndata rates and latencies. Network capacity is based on the number of users that\\nattain these KPIs. However, the UX of an immersive application for a given data\\nrate and latency is not the same across users, since it depends on other\\nfactors such as the complexity of the media being transmitted and the encoder\\nformat. This implies that guarantees on network KPIs do not necessarily\\ntranslate to guarantees on the UX.\\n  In this paper, we propose a framework in which the communication network can\\nprovide guarantees on the UX. The framework requires application servers to\\nshare real-time information on UX dependency on data rate to the network, which\\nin turn, uses this information to maximize a UX-based network utility function.\\nOur framework is motivated by the recent industry trends of increasing\\napplication awareness at the network, and pushing application servers towards\\nthe edge, allowing for tighter coordination between the servers and the 6G\\nsystem. Our simulation results show that the proposed framework substantially\\nimproves the UX capacity of the network, which is the number of users above a\\ncertain UX threshold, compared to conventional rate control algorithms.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T04:10:38Z\"}"}
