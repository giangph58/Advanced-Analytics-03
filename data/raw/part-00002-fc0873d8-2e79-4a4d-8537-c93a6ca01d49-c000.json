These\\nsimilarities inspire a metaphor for LLMs which could open new avenues for\\nresearch into interaction paradigms and shared representations. Our visual\\nsystem metaphor introduces possibilities for addressing these challenges by\\nunderstanding the information landscape assimilated by LLMs. In this paper we\\nmotivate our proposal, introduce the interrelating theories from the fields\\nthat inspired this view and discuss research directions that stem from this\\nabstraction.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T11:07:11Z\"}"}
