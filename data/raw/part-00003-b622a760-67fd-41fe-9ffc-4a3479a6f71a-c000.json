{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05796v1\", \"title\": \"X-ray Strain and Stress Tensor Tomography\", \"summary\": \"The microscopic distribution of strain and stress plays a crucial role for\\nthe performance, safety, and lifetime of components in aeronautics, automotive\\nand critical infrastructure [1]. While non-destructive methods for measuring\\nthe stress close to the surface have long been long established, only a limited\\nnumber of approaches for depth-resolved measurements based on x-rays or\\nneutrons are available [2]. These feature significant limitations, including\\nlong scan times, intricate experimental set-ups, limited spatial resolution or\\nanisotropic gauge volumes with aspect ratios of 1:10 or worse. Here, we present\\na method that overcomes these limitations and obtains tomographic\\nreconstructions of the full six-dimensional strain and stress tensor\\ncomponents. Using a simple and wide spread experimental set-up that combines\\nx-ray powder diffraction with single axis tomography, we achieve\\nnon-destructive determination of depth-resolved strain and stress distributions\\nwith isotropic resolution. The presented method could be of interest for\\nadditive manufacturing of metals [3,4], battery research [5], in-situ\\nmetallurgy [6] and the experimental validation of finite element simulations\\n[7].\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.ins-det\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T08:23:26Z\"}"}
