We show that the\\nso-called non-perturbative differentials form a special case of this revisited\\nversion of blobbed topological recursion. Furthermore, we prove the KP\\nintegrability of the differentials of blobbed topological recursion for the\\ninput data that include KP-integrable blobs. This result generalizes, unifies,\\nand gives a new proof of the KP integrability of nonperturbative differentials\\nconjectured by Borot--Eynard and recently proved by the authors.\", \"main_category\": \"math-ph\", \"categories\": \"math-ph,hep-th,math.MP,nlin.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T13:58:45Z\"}"}
