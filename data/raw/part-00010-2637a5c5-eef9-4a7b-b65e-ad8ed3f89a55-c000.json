However, existing methods often struggle to\\naccurately capture this intricate structure from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)\\ndata, particularly due to the lack of ground truth labels and the ambiguous,\\nintertwined nature of fiber trajectories. We present a novel deep learning\\nframework for unsupervised clustering of myocardial fibers, providing a\\ndata-driven approach to identifying distinct fiber bundles. We uniquely combine\\na Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network to capture local sequential\\ninformation along fibers, with a Transformer autoencoder to learn global shape\\nfeatures, with pointwise incorporation of essential anatomical context.\\nClustering these representations using a density-based algorithm identifies 33\\nto 62 robust clusters, successfully capturing the subtle distinctions in fiber\\ntrajectories with varying levels of granularity. Our framework offers a new,\\nflexible, and quantitative way to analyze myocardial structure, achieving a\\nlevel of delineation that, to our knowledge, has not been previously achieved,\\nwith potential applications in improving surgical planning, characterizing\\ndisease-related remodeling, and ultimately, advancing personalized cardiac\\ncare.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T17:56:57Z\"}"}
