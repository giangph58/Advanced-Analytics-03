Further, we show\\nthat the \\\\mdds~problem is \\\\apx-hard for various shapes in the plane. Finally,\\nwe prove that both \\\\mdis~and \\\\mdds~problems are \\\\np-hard for unit disks\\nintersecting a horizontal line and axis-parallel unit squares intersecting a\\nstraight line with slope $-1$.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CG\", \"categories\": \"cs.CG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T12:28:34Z\"}"}
