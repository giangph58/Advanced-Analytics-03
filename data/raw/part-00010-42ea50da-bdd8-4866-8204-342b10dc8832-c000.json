However, it becomes less\\nsufficient in describing the electronic properties of highly charged ions\\n(HCIs) in which many of the outermost electrons are ionized. In this work, we\\nput forward a periodic table particularly suitable for HCIs. It is constructed\\npurely based on the successive electron occupation of relativistic orbitals.\\nWhile providing a much-simplified description of the level structure of highly\\ncharged isoelectronic ions -- essential for laboratory and astrophysical plasma\\nspectroscopies, such a periodic table predicts a large family of highly\\nforbidden transitions suitable for the development of next-generation optical\\natomic clocks. Furthermore, we also identify universal linear $Z$ scaling laws\\n($Z$ is the nuclear charge) in the so-called ``Coulomb splittings'' between\\nangular momentum multiplets along isoelectronic sequences, complementing the\\nphysics of electron-electron interactions in multielectron atomic systems.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph,physics.optics,physics.plasm-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:39:09Z\"}"}
