{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14851v1\", \"title\": \"Highly Stable Silicon Anodes Enabled by Sub-10 nm Pores and Particles\", \"summary\": \"Silicon anodes offer high energy densities for next-generation lithium-ion\\nbatteries; however, their application is limited by severe volume expansion\\nduring cycling. Making silicon porous or nanostructured mitigates this\\nexpansion but often increases lithium inventory losses due to the inherent high\\nsurface area of nanomaterials. This study introduces a simple bottom-up process\\nthat overcomes this limitation. The approach relies on small silicon particles\\n(<10 nm) produced using an efficient low-temperature plasma approach. These\\nsmall building blocks are assembled into micron-scale superstructures\\ncharacterized by uniformly dispersed sub-10 nm pores. This structure addresses\\nboth volume expansion and lithium-inventory issues while achieving tap\\ndensities exceeding those of commercial graphite (~1.2 g/cm3), all while\\nmaintaining good processability. The resulting silicon-dominant anodes achieve\\nremarkable stability in full pouch cells with NMC811 and LFP cathodes,\\nretaining ~80% capacity for more than 400 cycles without pre-lithiation,\\ngraphite blending, or pre-cycling.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T04:21:42Z\"}"}
