The statistical limit, corresponding\\nto decaying turbulence, can be computed in quadrature. We find the decay\\nspectrum and the scaling functions of the pair correlation and match them with\\nphysical and real experiments.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn,hep-th,nlin.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T13:13:36Z\"}"}
