We focus on constrained systems of great current interest in the\\ncontext of Rydberg atoms and synthetic or emergent gauge theories. We find that\\ntheir state graphs host motifs which produce flat bands in the many-body\\nspectrum at a particular set of energies. Basis states in Fock space exhibit\\nEdwards-Anderson type parameters in the absence of quenched disorder, with an\\nintricate, possibly fractal, distribution over Fock space which is reflected in\\na distinctive structure of a non-vanishing post-quench long-time Loschmidt\\necho, an experimentally accessible quantity.In general, phenomena familiar from\\nsingle-particle flat bands manifest themselves in characteristic many-body\\nincarnations, such as a reentrant `Anderson' delocalisation, offering a rich\\nensemble of experimental signatures in the abovementioned quantum simulators.\\nThe variety of single-particle flat band types suggests an analogous\\ntypology--and concomitant phenomenological richness to be explored--of their\\nmany-body counterparts.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas,cond-mat.dis-nn,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T16:54:38Z\"}"}
