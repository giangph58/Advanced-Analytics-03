{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03379v1\", \"title\": \"Hybrid NOMA Assisted Heterogeneous Semantic and Bit Users Communication\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we utilize a downlink hybrid Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access\\n(NOMA) framework to support multiple semantic and bit users within the\\ncommunication network. The hybrid NOMA setup exploits both NOMA and Orthogonal\\nMultiple Access (OMA) which has the benefit of enhancing Spectral Efficiency\\n(SE) by allowing users to dynamically access the resources in multiple\\nheterogeneous slots. This enables integrating semantic and bit users based on\\ntheir channel gains, while adopting bit-to-semantic decoding order in slots\\nincluding heterogeneous users. An optimization problem for the power allocation\\nis formulated with the aim of maximizing the equivalent ergodic semantic SE\\nwith a constraint on the total available power of the Access Point (AP). The\\nproposed algorithm uses NOMA in shared slots and OMA in bit-user-only slots.\\nSimulation results validate the benefits of heterogeneous users hybrid NOMA\\nsetup in comparison to OMA-only for heterogeneous users.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T09:56:50Z\"}"}
