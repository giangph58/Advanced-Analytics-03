We\\nexplicitly compute the internal and external angles at all faces of an\\northocentric simplex. To this end, we introduce a parametric family of\\npolyhedral cones, called orthocentric cones, and derive formulas for their\\nangles and, more generally, for their conic intrinsic volumes.\\n  We characterize the tangent and normal cones of orthocentric simplices in\\nterms of orthocentric cones with explicit parameters. Depending on whether the\\northocenter lies inside the simplex, on its boundary, or outside, the simplex\\nis classified as acute, rectangular, or obtuse, respectively. The solid angle\\nformulas differ in these three cases.\\n  As a probabilistic application of the angle formulas, we explicitly compute\\nthe expected number of $k$-dimensional faces and the expected volume of the\\nrandom polytope $[g_1/\\\\tau_1, \\\\ldots, g_n/\\\\tau_n]$, where $g_1, \\\\ldots, g_n$\\nare independent standard Gaussian vectors in $\\\\mathbb{R}^d$, and $\\\\tau_1,\\n\\\\ldots, \\\\tau_n > 0$ are constants.\", \"main_category\": \"math.MG\", \"categories\": \"math.MG,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T08:35:10Z\"}"}
