Fundamental and novel results pertaining to these\\nfunctions are proven. Furthermore, results already existing in the literature\\nare translated in terms of auxiliary zeta functions. Their relationship to\\nJacobian elliptic functions and Jacobian functions are given.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CV\", \"categories\": \"math.CV,math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T06:50:55Z\"}"}
