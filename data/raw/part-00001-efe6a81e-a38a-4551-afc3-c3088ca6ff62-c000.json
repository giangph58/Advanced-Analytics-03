{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24012v1\", \"title\": \"Tree-Guided $L_1$-Convex Clustering\", \"summary\": \"Convex clustering is a modern clustering framework that guarantees globally\\noptimal solutions and performs comparably to other advanced clustering methods.\\nHowever, obtaining a complete dendrogram (clusterpath) for large-scale datasets\\nremains computationally challenging due to the extensive costs associated with\\niterative optimization approaches. To address this limitation, we develop a\\nnovel convex clustering algorithm called Tree-Guided $L_1$-Convex Clustering\\n(TGCC). We first focus on the fact that the loss function of $L_1$-convex\\nclustering with tree-structured weights can be efficiently optimized using a\\ndynamic programming approach. We then develop an efficient cluster fusion\\nalgorithm that utilizes the tree structure of the weights to accelerate the\\noptimization process and eliminate the issue of cluster splits commonly\\nobserved in convex clustering. By combining the dynamic programming approach\\nwith the cluster fusion algorithm, the TGCC algorithm achieves superior\\ncomputational efficiency without sacrificing clustering performance.\\nRemarkably, our TGCC algorithm can construct a complete clusterpath for $10^6$\\npoints in $\\\\mathbb{R}^2$ within 15 seconds on a standard laptop without the\\nneed for parallel or distributed computing frameworks. Moreover, we extend the\\nTGCC algorithm to develop biclustering and sparse convex clustering algorithms.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,stat.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T12:39:48Z\"}"}
