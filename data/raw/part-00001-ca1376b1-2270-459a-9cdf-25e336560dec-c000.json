In this paper,\\nwe propose a new neural network (NN) model, which can be used for joint digital\\npre-distortion (DPD) of non-ideal IQ modulators and PAs in a transmitter with\\nmultiple operating states. The model is based on the methodology of multi-task\\nlearning (MTL). In this model, the hidden layers of the main NN are shared by\\nall signal states, and the output layer's weights and biases are dynamically\\ngenerated by another NN. The experimental results show that the proposed model\\ncan effectively perform joint DPD for IQ-PA systems, and it achieves better\\noverall performance within multiple signal states than the existing methods.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T12:48:44Z\"}"}
