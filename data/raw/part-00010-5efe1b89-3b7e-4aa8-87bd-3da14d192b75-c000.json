Calculations relying on the assumption of\\ninelastic final-state interactions occurring between the pairs of pions and\\nkaons fall short of the experimental value. It has been pointed out that a\\nthird channel of four pions can leave imprints on the CP asymmetries of the\\ntwo-body decays. At the same time, plenty of data are available for the $4\\\\pi$\\ndecays of charmed mesons, as well as for the rare decays\\n$D^0\\\\to\\\\pi^+\\\\pi^-\\\\ell^+\\\\ell^-$. With this motivation, we study the cascade\\ntopology $D^0\\\\to a_1(1260)^+(\\\\to \\\\rho(770)^0\\\\pi^+)\\\\,\\\\pi^-$, which has been\\nmeasured to contribute significantly to the $4\\\\pi$ decays, and estimate its\\neffect on the branching ratio of the rare decays. We also explore the\\npossibility of this topology contributing to the decay amplitude of\\n$D^0\\\\to\\\\pi^+\\\\pi^-$ and by extension to the related CP asymmetry.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T09:03:15Z\"}"}
