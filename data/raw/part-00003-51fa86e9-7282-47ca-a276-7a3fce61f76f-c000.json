{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16569v1\", \"title\": \"The versal deformation of elliptic m-fold point curve singularities\", \"summary\": \"We give explicit, highly symmetric equations for the versal deformation of\\nthe singularity $L_{n+1}^n$ consisting of n+1 lines through the origin in\\nn-dimensional affine space in generic position. These make evident that the\\nbase space of the versal deformation of $L_{n+1}^n$ is isomorphic to the total\\nspace for $L_{n}^{n-1}$, if n>4. By induction it follows that the base space is\\nirreducible and Gorenstein. We discuss the known connection to a modular\\ncompactification of the moduli space of (n+1)-pointed curves of genus 1.\\n  For other elliptic partition curves it seems unfeasable to compute the versal\\ndeformation in general. It is doubtful whether the base space is Gorenstein.\\nFor rational partition curves we show that the base space in general has\\ncomponents of different dimensions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T09:47:01Z\"}"}
