In this work, we develop a novel skew-symmetric neural\\narchitecture as closure model that enforces stability while preserving key\\nphysical conservation laws. Our approach leverages a discretization that\\nensures mass, momentum, and energy conservation, along with a face-averaging\\nfilter to maintain mass conservation in coarse-grained velocity fields. We\\ncompare our model against several conventional data-driven closures (including\\nunconstrained convolutional neural networks), and the physics-based Smagorinsky\\nmodel. Performance is evaluated on decaying turbulence and Kolmogorov flow for\\nmultiple coarse-graining factors. In these test cases we observe that\\nunconstrained machine learning models suffer from numerical instabilities. In\\ncontrast, our skew-symmetric model remains stable across all tests, though at\\nthe cost of increased dissipation. Despite this trade-off, we demonstrate that\\nour model still outperforms the Smagorinsky model in unseen scenarios. These\\nfindings highlight the potential of structure-preserving machine learning\\nclosures for reliable long-time LES.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.NA,math.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:49:18Z\"}"}
