{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04234v1\", \"title\": \"Quantum Classifiers with Trainable Kernel\", \"summary\": \"Kernel function plays a crucial role in machine learning algorithms such as\\nclassifiers. In this paper, we aim to improve the classification performance\\nand reduce the reading out burden of quantum classifiers. We devise a\\nuniversally trainable quantum feature mapping layout to broaden the scope of\\nfeature states and avoid the inefficiently straight preparation of quantum\\nsuperposition states. We also propose an improved quantum support vector\\nmachine that employs partially evenly weighted trial states. In addition, we\\nanalyze its error sources and superiority. As a promotion, we propose a quantum\\niterative multi-classifier framework for one-versus-one and one-versus-rest\\napproaches. Finally, we conduct corresponding numerical demonstrations in the\\n\\\\textit{qiskit} package. The simulation result of trainable quantum feature\\nmapping shows considerable clustering performance, and the subsequent\\nclassification performance is superior to the existing quantum classifiers in\\nterms of accuracy and distinguishability.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:38:50Z\"}"}
