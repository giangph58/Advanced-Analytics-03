However, to propose a black hole model for\\nexperimental verification, we must clearly understand which parameters describe\\nthe black hole and what physical constraints can be imposed on each parameter.\\nWhen considering dynamical black holes with a barotropic equation of state, an\\nadditional integration constant arises, the nature of which remains unclear\\nexcept for a few specific values of the equation of state coefficient.\\nNevertheless, when examining solutions such as Husain or Kiselev, we can\\nobserve remarkable effects related to black hole evaporation, which are\\nassociated with the violation of null energy conditions. However, the main\\nissue lies in the fact that while violations of energy conditions may occur in\\nnature, the ambiguity in the values of parameters describing black holes makes\\nit difficult to determine whether such violations result from natural physical\\nprocesses or are purely mathematical artifacts that should be excluded from\\nconsideration. Moreover, energy conditions play a crucial role in the evolution\\nof a black hole shadow - a characteristic that can potentially be observed\\nexperimentally. In this article, we elucidate the parameter arising in Husain's\\nand Kiselev's solutions using nonlinear electrodynamics. We demonstrate that\\nfor physically relevant equations of state, the additional parameter represents\\na combination of electric and magnetic charges.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T15:53:44Z\"}"}
