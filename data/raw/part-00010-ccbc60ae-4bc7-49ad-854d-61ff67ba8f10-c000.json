This\\nreport presents our solution, which ranked second in the MOSE track of CVPR\\n2025 PVUW Challenge. Based on an existing segmentation framework, we propose an\\nimproved model named MASSeg for complex video object segmentation, and\\nconstruct an enhanced dataset, MOSE+, which includes typical scenarios with\\nocclusions, cluttered backgrounds, and small target instances. During training,\\nwe incorporate a combination of inter-frame consistent and inconsistent data\\naugmentation strategies to improve robustness and generalization. During\\ninference, we design a mask output scaling strategy to better adapt to varying\\nobject sizes and occlusion levels. As a result, MASSeg achieves a J score of\\n0.8250, F score of 0.9007, and a J&F score of 0.8628 on the MOSE test set.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T14:15:46Z\"}"}
