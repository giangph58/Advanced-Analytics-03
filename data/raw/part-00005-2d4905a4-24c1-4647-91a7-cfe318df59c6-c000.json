{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04501v1\", \"title\": \"Bayesian Estimation of Extreme Quantiles and the Exceedance Distribution\\n  for Paretian Tails\", \"summary\": \"Estimating extreme quantiles is an important task in many applications,\\nincluding financial risk management and climatology. More important than\\nestimating the quantile itself is to insure zero coverage error, which implies\\nthe quantile estimate should, on average, reflect the desired probability of\\nexceedance. In this research, we show that for unconditional distributions\\nisomorphic to the exponential, a Bayesian quantile estimate results in zero\\ncoverage error. This compares to the traditional maximum likelihood method,\\nwhere the coverage error can be significant under small sample sizes even\\nthough the quantile estimate is unbiased. More generally, we prove a sufficient\\ncondition for an unbiased quantile estimator to result in coverage error.\\nInterestingly, our results hold by virtue of using a Jeffreys prior for the\\nunknown parameters and is independent of the true prior. We also derive an\\nexpression for the distribution, and moments, of future exceedances which is\\nvital for risk assessment. We extend our results to the conditional tail of\\ndistributions with asymptotic Paretian tails and, in particular, those in the\\nFr\\\\'echet maximum domain of attraction. We illustrate our results using\\nsimulations for a variety of light and heavy-tailed distributions.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T15:21:17Z\"}"}
