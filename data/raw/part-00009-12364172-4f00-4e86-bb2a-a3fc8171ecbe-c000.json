Comparing the topological charge\\ndefined by the Wilson flow and the over-improved DBW2 flow we find that already\\nat small flow times the latter stabilises on discrete values. We provide\\nevidence that as the lattice spacing is lowered the Wilson flow also separates\\ninto discrete sectors at earlier flow times. Adopting the DWB2 definition in\\nthe remainder of the analysis, we do not see any evidence of fractional\\ntopological charges, which could in principle appear at finite lattice spacing.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-lat\", \"categories\": \"hep-lat\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T13:02:50Z\"}"}
