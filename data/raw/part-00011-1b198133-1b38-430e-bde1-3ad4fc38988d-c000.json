In this context, pyroelectric materials, which\\nhold the capacity for charge generation when subjected to temperature changes,\\noffer a promising route for this modulation. This work employs spatially\\nresolved photoluminescence (PL) to explore the impact of pyroelectricity on the\\nelectronic doping of monolayer MoS2 deposited on periodically poled LiNbO3 (LN)\\nsubstrates. The results demonstrate that pyroelectricity in LN modulates the\\ncharge carrier density in MoS2 on ferroelectric surfaces acting as doping\\nmechanism without the need for gating electrodes. Furthermore, upon cooling,\\npyroelectric charges effectively reverse the doping of p-n junctions on DWs,\\nconverting them into n-p junctions. These findings highlight the potential of\\npyroelectric substrates for tunable and configurable charge engineering in\\ntransition metal dichalcogenides and suggest their applicability to other\\ncombinations of 2D materials and ferroelectric substrates. They also open\\navenues for alternative device architectures in nanoelectronic or nanophotonic\\ndevices including switches, memories or sensors.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T09:52:37Z\"}"}
