Compared with traditional Feynman rules, the Baikov formalism\\noffers a more structured and transparent framework, especially well suited for\\nanalyzing the reduction problem. We emphasize that, in a variety of nontrivial\\ncases including several one loop and selected multi loop examples the\\ngenerating functions can be explicitly computed in closed form, often involving\\nhypergeometric or elementary functions. These analytic expressions signifi\\ncantly simplify the determination of reduction coefficients and enhance their\\ninterpretability. The results demonstrate the practicality and potential of\\nthis approach, suggesting that the use of generating functions within the\\nBaikov representation can serve as a powerful and flexible tool in modern\\nFeynman integral reduction, even though its full scope for generic multi-loop\\ntopologies remains to be explored.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T13:38:03Z\"}"}
