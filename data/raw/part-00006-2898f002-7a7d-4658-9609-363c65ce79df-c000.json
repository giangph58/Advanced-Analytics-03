The challenge is that defense of large-scale\\nsystems-of-systems requires scalability in their threat and risk assessment\\nenvironment for cyber physical analysis including cyber-informed transmission\\nplanning, decision-making, and intrusion response. Hence, we present a scalable\\ndiscrete event simulation tool for analysis of energy systems, called DESTinE.\\nThe tool is tailored for largescale cyber-physical systems, with a focus on\\npower systems. It supports faster-than-real-time traffic generation and models\\npacket flow and congestion under both normal and adversarial conditions. Using\\nthree well-established power system synthetic cases with 500, 2000, and 10,000\\nbuses, we overlay a constructed cyber network employing star and radial\\ntopologies. Experiments are conducted to identify critical nodes within a\\ncommunication network in response to a disturbance. The findings are\\nincorporated into a constrained optimization problem to assess the impact of\\nthe disturbance on a specific node and its cascading effects on the overall\\nnetwork. Based on the solution of the optimization problem, a new hybrid\\nnetwork topology is also derived, combining the strengths of star and radial\\nstructures to improve network resilience. Furthermore, DESTinE is integrated\\nwith a virtual server and a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) system using Raspberry\\nPi 5.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T16:14:45Z\"}"}
