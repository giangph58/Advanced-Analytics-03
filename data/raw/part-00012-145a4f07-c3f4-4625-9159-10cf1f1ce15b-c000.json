{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10243v1\", \"title\": \"A parton shower consistent with parton densities at LO and NLO: PDF2ISR\", \"summary\": \"We present a method for obtaining an initial-state parton shower model where\\nthe (backward) evolution fully consistent with the (forward) evolution of the\\ncollinear parton density used. As a proof-of-concept we use parton densities\\nobtained with the Parton Branching (PB) approach, and modify the default\\ninitial-state shower in PYTHIA8 with this method to be consistent with them. PB\\nis ideally suited for checking the validity of our method since, in addition to\\nproducing collinear parton densities, it also produces the corresponding\\ntransverse-dependent (TMD) ones, and these can then be directly compared to the\\ntransverse momentum distribution obtained from the parton shower. We show that\\nTMD distributions which we in this way obtain from our modified PYTHIA8 shower\\nusing leading order (LO) parton densities and splitting functions are fully\\nconsistent with the corresponding leading order TMD densities. At\\nnext-to-leading order (NLO) it is not possible to achieve the same consistency\\nusing the built-in LO splitting functions in the shower, but we show that by\\nintroducing NLO splitting functions using a reweighting procedure, we can\\nachieve consistency also at NLO. The method presented here, which we have named\\nPDF2ISR, can be easily extended to any collinear parton densities, as long as\\nthe exact conditions for the evolution are known. With the PDF2ISR method we\\nobtain an initial-state parton shower which in principle has no free\\nparameters, and is fully consistent with collinear parton densities at LO and\\nNLO.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T14:07:55Z\"}"}
