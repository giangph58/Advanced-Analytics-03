This paper presents COT Fine-tuned, a novel framework\\nfor detecting AI-generated text and identifying the specific language model.\\nresponsible for generating the text. We propose a dual-task approach, where\\nTask A involves classifying text as AI-generated or human-written, and Task B\\nidentifies the specific LLM behind the text. The key innovation of our method\\nlies in the use of Chain-of-Thought reasoning, which enables the model to\\ngenerate explanations for its predictions, enhancing transparency and\\ninterpretability. Our experiments demonstrate that COT Fine-tuned achieves high\\naccuracy in both tasks, with strong performance in LLM identification and\\nhuman-AI classification. We also show that the CoT reasoning process\\ncontributes significantly to the models effectiveness and interpretability.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T17:39:49Z\"}"}
