Arya et al. [STOC'95] showed in their seminal work that\\nthere exists a construction of Euclidean $(1+\\\\varepsilon)$-spanners with\\nhop-diameter $O(\\\\log n)$ and lightness $O(\\\\log n)$. They also gave a general\\ntradeoff of hop-diameter $k$ and sparsity $O(\\\\alpha_k(n))$, where $\\\\alpha_k$ is\\na very slowly growing inverse of an Ackermann-style function. The former\\ncombination of logarithmic hop-diameter and lightness is optimal due to the\\nlower bound by Dinitz et al. [FOCS'08]. Later, Elkin and Solomon [STOC'13]\\ngeneralized the light spanner construction to doubling metrics and extended the\\ntradeoff for more values of hop-diameter $k$. In a recent line of work\\n[SoCG'22, SoCG'23], Le et al. proved that the aforementioned tradeoff between\\nthe hop-diameter and sparsity is tight for every choice of hop-diameter $k$. A\\nfundamental question remains: What is the optimal tradeoff between the\\nhop-diameter and lightness for every value of $k$?\\n  In this paper, we present a general framework for constructing light spanners\\nwith small hop-diameter. Our framework is based on tree covers. In particular,\\nwe show that if a metric admits a tree cover with $\\\\gamma$ trees, stretch $t$,\\nand lightness $L$, then it also admits a $t$-spanner with hop-diameter $k$ and\\nlightness $O(kn^{2/k}\\\\cdot \\\\gamma L)$. Further, we note that the tradeoff for\\ntrees is tight due to a construction in uniform line metric, which is perhaps\\nthe simplest tree metric. As a direct consequence of this framework, we obtain\\na tight tradeoff between lightness and hop-diameter for doubling metrics in the\\nentire regime of $k$.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS,cs.CG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T16:13:54Z\"}"}
