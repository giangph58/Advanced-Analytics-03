However, typically, changing the topology of\\nelectronic states in a crystalline material is challenging because their nature\\nis underpinned by chemical composition and lattice symmetry that are difficult\\nto modify. We propose junctions between rhombohedral graphite crystals as a\\nplatform that enables smooth transition between topologically trivial and\\nnon-trivial regimes distinguished by the absence or presence of topological\\njunction states. By invoking an analogy with the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model,\\nthe appearance of topological states is related to the symmetry of the atomic\\nstacking at the interface between the crystals. The possibility to explore both\\nthe topological and non-topological phases is provided by sliding the crystals\\nwith respect to each other.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.other\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T10:23:15Z\"}"}
