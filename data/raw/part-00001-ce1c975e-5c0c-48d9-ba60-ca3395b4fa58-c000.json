Such a prethermal Meissner phase is\\ncharacterized by a finite time-averaged chiral current. We find an analytic\\nexpression of these frequencies using Floquet perturbation theory. Our analysis\\nreveals that the presence of the prethermal Meissner phase is tied to the\\nemergence of strong Hilbert space fragmentation in these driven ladders. We\\nsupport our analytical results by numerical study of finite-size flux ladders\\nusing exact diagonalization and discuss experiments using ultracold dipolar\\natom platforms that may test our theory.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas,cond-mat.other\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T09:41:37Z\"}"}
