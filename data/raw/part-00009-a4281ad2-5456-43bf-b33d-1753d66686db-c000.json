Its main result is an extension of our previous\\nwork on the irreversible two tissue compartment model. In analogy to our\\nprevious work, we show that also in the (practically highly relevant)\\nreversible case, most tracer kinetic parameters can be uniquely identified from\\nstandard PET measurements (without additional full blood sample analysis that\\nis usually performed in practice) and under reasonable assumptions. In\\naddition, unique identifiability of all parameters is shown provided that\\nadditional measurements from the (uncorrected) total arterial blood tracer\\nconcentration (which can be obtained from standard PET measurements or from a\\nsimple blood sample analysis) are available.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,math.CA,math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T07:56:41Z\"}"}
