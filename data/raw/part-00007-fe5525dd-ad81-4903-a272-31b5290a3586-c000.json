{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02332v1\", \"title\": \"Stability of complex communities: A perspective from discrete-time\\n  dynamics\", \"summary\": \"Understanding the stability of complex communities is a central focus in\\necology, many important theoretical advancements have been made to identify\\ndrivers of ecological stability. However, previous results often rely on the\\ncontinuous-time dynamics, assuming that species have overlapping generations.\\nIn contrast, numerous real-world communities consist of species with\\nnon-overlapping generations, whose quantitative behavior can only be precisely\\nrepresented by discrete-time dynamics rather than continuous ones. Here, we\\ndevelop a theoretical framework and propose a metric to quantify the stability\\nof complex communities characterized by non-overlapping generations and diverse\\ninteraction types. In stark contrast to existing results for overlapping\\ngenerations, we find that increasing self-regulation strength first stabilizes\\nand then destabilizes complex communities. This pattern is further confirmed in\\nboth exploitative (E. aerogenes, P. aurantiaca, P. chlororaphis, P.\\ncitronellolis) and competitive (P. putida, P. veroni, S. marcescens) soil\\nmicrobial communities. Moreover, we show that communities with diverse\\ninteraction types become the most stable, which is corroborated by empirical\\nmouse microbial networks. Furthermore, we reveal that the prevalence of weak\\ninteractions can stabilize communities, which is consistent with findings from\\nexisting microbial experiments. Our analyses of complex communities with\\nnon-overlapping generations provide a more comprehensive understanding of\\necological stability and informs practical strategies for ecological\\nrestoration and control.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.PE\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.PE,physics.bio-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T07:10:52Z\"}"}
