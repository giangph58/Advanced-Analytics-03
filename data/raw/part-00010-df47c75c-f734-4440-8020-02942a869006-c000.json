However, existing techniques are often limited by\\nthe need for physical contact or insufficient spatial resolution for the\\nmeasurement of local temperature and mapping its distribution. Here, we\\nshowcase the direct temperature measurement of graphene with nanometer spatial\\nresolution in transmission electron microscopy. In experiments, combining a\\nscanning nanobeam with precession electron diffraction offers the collection of\\nkinemetic diffraction from a local area at the nanometer scale. In analysis, we\\nuse a pre-calculated, sample-specific structure-factor-based correction method\\nto enable the linear fitting of the diffraction intensities, allowing the\\ndetermination of the Debye-Waller factor as a function of temperature at the\\nprecision of 10-4{\\\\AA}2/{\\\\deg}C. With the high spatial resolution and\\nmeasurement precision, the temperature and thermal vibration mapping further\\nreveal the influence of graphene lattice parameters and thickness on the\\nDebye-Waller factor, providing valuable insights into the vibrational\\nproperties impacted by temperature, lattice structure, and graphene layer\\nthickness.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T06:59:10Z\"}"}
