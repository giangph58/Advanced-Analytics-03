{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05942v1\", \"title\": \"Higher-order meshless schemes for hyperbolic equations\", \"summary\": \"We discuss the order, efficiency, stability and positivity of several\\nmeshless schemes for linear scalar hyperbolic equations. Meshless schemes are\\nGeneralised Finite Difference Methods (GFDMs) for arbitrary irregular grids in\\nwhich there is no connectivity between the grid points. We propose a new\\nMUSCL-like meshless scheme that uses a central stencil, with which we can\\nachieve arbitrarily high orders, and compare it to existing meshless upwind\\nschemes and meshless WENO schemes. The stability of the newly proposed scheme\\nis guaranteed by an upwind reconstruction to the midpoints of the stencil. The\\nnew meshless MUSCL scheme is also efficient due to the reuse of the GFDM\\nsolution in the reconstruction. We combine the new MUSCL scheme with a\\nMulti-dimensional Optimal Order Detection (MOOD) procedure to avoid spurious\\noscillations at discontinuities. In one spatial dimension, our fourth order\\nMUSCL scheme outperforms existing WENO and upwind schemes in terms of stability\\nand accuracy. In two spatial dimensions, our MUSCL scheme achieves similar\\naccuracy to an existing WENO scheme but is significantly more stable.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T11:57:01Z\"}"}
