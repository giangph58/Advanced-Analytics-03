{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19984v1\", \"title\": \"3D MPSoC with On-Chip Cache Support -- Design and Exploitation\", \"summary\": \"The increasing density of transistors in Integrated Circuits (ICs) has\\nenabled the development of highly integrated Systems-on-Chip (SoCs) and, more\\nrecently, Multiprocessor Systems-on-Chip (MPSoCs). To address scalability\\nchallenges in communication and memory performance, three-dimensional (3D)\\nNetwork-on-Chip (NoC) architectures have emerged, offering improvements in\\ncommunication latency and throughput. However, memory system efficiency remains\\na critical bottleneck in NoC-based designs. This work proposes the design and\\nexperimental exploration of 3D MPSoCs with on-chip cache support by employing\\ndistinct communication infrastructures for inter-processor and memory\\ninteractions. Specifically, packet-based NoCs are adopted for inter-processor\\ncommunication, while a crossbar-based infrastructure supports a cache coherence\\nhierarchy for memory access. A two-layer system architecture is introduced,\\ncombining a Uniform Memory Access (UMA) model within clusters and a No Remote\\nMemory Access (NORMA) model between clusters, aiming to balance scalability and\\ncoherence requirements. Emerging memory technologies such as PCRAM and MRAM are\\nexplored to optimize performance, energy consumption, and area usage.\\nExperimental evaluations are conducted using the Gem5 simulator, targeting a\\nmodel based on the ARM Versatile Express platform. The outcomes of this study\\naim to enhance MPSoC scalability while meeting the stringent demands of\\nmemory-centric applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AR\", \"categories\": \"cs.AR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:59:13Z\"}"}
