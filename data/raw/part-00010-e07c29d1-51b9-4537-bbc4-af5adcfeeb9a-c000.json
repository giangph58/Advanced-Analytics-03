{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02648v1\", \"title\": \"Controlled Social Learning: Altruism vs. Bias\", \"summary\": \"We introduce a model of sequential social learning in which a planner may pay\\na cost to adjust the private signal precision of some agents. This framework\\npresents a new optimization problem for social learning that sheds light on\\npractical policy questions, such as how the socially optimal level of ad\\npersonalization changes according to current beliefs or how a biased planner\\nmight derail social learning. We then characterize the optimal policies of an\\naltruistic planner who maximizes social welfare and a biased planner who seeks\\nto induce a specific action. Even for a planner who has equivalent knowledge to\\nan individual, cannot lie or cherry-pick information, and is fully observable,\\nwe demonstrate that it can dramatically influence social welfare in both\\npositive and negative directions. An important area for future exploration is\\nhow one might prevent these latter outcomes to protect against the manipulation\\nof social learning.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.GT,cs.SI,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:45:24Z\"}"}
