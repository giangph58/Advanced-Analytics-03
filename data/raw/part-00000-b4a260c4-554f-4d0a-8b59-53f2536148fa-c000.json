Using numerical simulations within a time-dependent\\nGinzburg-Landau (TDGL) approach, we analyze vortex viscosity in a model\\nfeaturing an s-wave superconducting order parameter coupled to an Ising-like\\nnematic order parameter, suitable for systems with $C_4$ symmetry. Our results\\nindicate that nematicity induces a significant anisotropy in the flux-flow\\nresistivity, which depends on both vortex core shape anisotropy and\\nnormal-phase conductivity anisotropy. These two effects can either compete or\\ncooperate with each other. We discuss the implications of these findings for\\nidentifying nematic superconductivity in the superconducting phase. Our work\\nprovides new insights into the interplay between nematic and superconducting\\norder parameters, leading to new possibilities for experimental and theoretical\\nexploration of anisotropic transport properties in unconventional\\nsuperconductors.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T16:51:09Z\"}"}
