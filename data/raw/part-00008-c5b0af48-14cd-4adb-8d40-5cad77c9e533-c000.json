{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21692v1\", \"title\": \"Enhancing Self-Supervised Fine-Grained Video Object Tracking with\\n  Dynamic Memory Prediction\", \"summary\": \"Successful video analysis relies on accurate recognition of pixels across\\nframes, and frame reconstruction methods based on video correspondence learning\\nare popular due to their efficiency. Existing frame reconstruction methods,\\nwhile efficient, neglect the value of direct involvement of multiple reference\\nframes for reconstruction and decision-making aspects, especially in complex\\nsituations such as occlusion or fast movement. In this paper, we introduce a\\nDynamic Memory Prediction (DMP) framework that innovatively utilizes multiple\\nreference frames to concisely and directly enhance frame reconstruction. Its\\ncore component is a Reference Frame Memory Engine that dynamically selects\\nframes based on object pixel features to improve tracking accuracy. In\\naddition, a Bidirectional Target Prediction Network is built to utilize\\nmultiple reference frames to improve the robustness of the model. Through\\nexperiments, our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art self-supervised\\ntechniques on two fine-grained video object tracking tasks: object segmentation\\nand keypoint tracking.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:29:04Z\"}"}
