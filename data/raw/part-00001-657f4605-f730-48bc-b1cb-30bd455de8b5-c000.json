To achieve the best description of heavy hadron production, several\\ninput parameters in both the soft and hard components of the model are tuned.\\nThe model effectively reproduces experimental data of $p_{T}$ spectra at low\\nand intermediate $p_{T}$, capturing key features of charm hadron production in\\nthe quark-gluon plasma medium. However, it overpredicts the data at high\\n$p_{T}$, indicating the need for improvements in modeling heavy quark energy\\nloss mechanisms. Another observable, the nuclear modification factors $R_{AA}$\\nand $R_{CP}$ for $D^{0}$ mesons exhibit significant suppression in central\\ncollisions, which matches with experimental observations, highlighting the\\nroles of collisional and radiative energy loss due to collective effects, such\\nas coalescence and radial flow. The antiparticle-to-particle and mixed particle\\nratios are also presented, showing good agreement with experimental data and\\nrevealing limitations in baryon production due to the absence of heavy quark\\ncoalescence in HYDJET++. Additionally, we compare the HYDJET++ results with\\nthose from other theoretical models, including TAMU, SUBATECH, Torino, Duke and\\nAMPT.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T07:46:33Z\"}"}
