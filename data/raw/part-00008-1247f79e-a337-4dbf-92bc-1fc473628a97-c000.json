{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19785v1\", \"title\": \"Heterophily-informed Message Passing\", \"summary\": \"Graph neural networks (GNNs) are known to be vulnerable to oversmoothing due\\nto their implicit homophily assumption. We mitigate this problem with a novel\\nscheme that regulates the aggregation of messages, modulating the type and\\nextent of message passing locally thereby preserving both the low and\\nhigh-frequency components of information. Our approach relies solely on learnt\\nembeddings, obviating the need for auxiliary labels, thus extending the\\nbenefits of heterophily-aware embeddings to broader applications, e.g.,\\ngenerative modelling. Our experiments, conducted across various data sets and\\nGNN architectures, demonstrate performance enhancements and reveal heterophily\\npatterns across standard classification benchmarks. Furthermore, application to\\nmolecular generation showcases notable performance improvements on\\nchemoinformatics benchmarks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T13:28:23Z\"}"}
