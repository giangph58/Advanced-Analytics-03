Established\\nobjective steering characteristics typically assess the feedback behavior in\\nthe frequency range of up to 30 Hz while factors such as steering wheel and\\nvehicle body vibrations at higher frequencies are mainly approached as comfort\\nissues. This work investigates the influence of steering wheel and vehicle body\\nexcitations in the frequency range between 30 and 100 Hz on the subjective\\nevaluation of steering feedback in a dynamic driving simulator. A controlled\\nsubject study with 42 participants was performed to compare a reference vehicle\\nwith an electrical power steering system to four variants of its virtual\\nrepresentation on a dynamic driving simulator. The effects of road-induced\\nexcitations were investigated by comparing a semi-empirical and a physics-based\\ntire model, while the influence of non-road-induced excitations was\\ninvestigated by implementing engine and wheel orders. The simulator variants\\nwere evaluated in comparison to the reference vehicle during closed-loop\\ndriving on a country road in a single-blind within-subjects design. The\\nsubjective evaluation focused on the perception of road feedback compared to\\nthe reference vehicle. The statistical analysis of subjective results shows\\nthat there is a strong effect of non-road-induced steering and vehicle body\\nexcitations, while the effect of road-induced excitations is considerably less\\npronounced.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T11:42:55Z\"}"}
