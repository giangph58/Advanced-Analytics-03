{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17762v1\", \"title\": \"Introducing STARDIS: An Open and Modular Stellar Spectral Synthesis Code\", \"summary\": \"We introduce a new 1D stellar spectral synthesis Python code called \\\\stardis.\\n\\\\stardis\\\\ is a modular, open-source radiative transfer code that is capable of\\nspectral synthesis from near-UV to IR for FGK stars. We describe the structure,\\ninputs, features, underlying physics, and assumptions of \\\\stardis\\\\ as well as\\nthe radiative transfer scheme implemented. To validate our code, we show\\nspectral comparisons between \\\\stardis\\\\ and \\\\textsc{korg} with the same input\\natmospheric structure models, and also compare qualitatively to\\n\\\\textsc{phoenix} for solar models. We find that \\\\stardis\\\\ generally agrees well\\nwith \\\\textsc{korg} for solar models on the few percent level or better, that\\nthe codes can diverge in the ultraviolet, with more extreme differences in\\ncooler stars. \\\\stardis\\\\ can be found at\\n\\\\href{https://github.com/tardis-sn/stardis}{https://github.com/tardis-sn/stardis},\\nand documentation can be found at\\n\\\\href{https://tardis-sn.github.io/stardis/}{https://tardis-sn.github.io/stardis/}.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T17:26:23Z\"}"}
