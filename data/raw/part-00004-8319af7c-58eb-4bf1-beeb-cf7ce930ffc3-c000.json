{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23792v1\", \"title\": \"When do firms sell high durability products? The case of light bulb\\n  industry\", \"summary\": \"This study empirically investigates firms' incentives on the choice of\\nproduct durability, and its social optimality, by developing a dynamic\\nstructural model of durable goods with forward-looking consumers and\\noligopolistic multi-product firms. Based on the observations of the light bulb\\nmarket, it specifies a model where firms produce multiple products with\\ndifferent durability levels and set product prices based on dynamic incentives.\\nIt proposes and applies novel estimation algorithms that alleviate the\\ncomputational burden and data requirement for estimating demand and marginal\\ncost parameters of dynamic demand models. Using light bulb market data in\\nJapan, structural parameters are estimated. This study obtains the following\\nresults. First, large firms have incentives to collude to eliminate high\\ndurability incandescent lamps, though it is profitable to sell them for each\\nfirm. In contrast, when they can collude on prices, they don't have incentives\\nto eliminate high durability bulbs. Second, eliminating high durability\\nincandescent lamps leads to larger producer and total surplus, though it leads\\nto lower consumer surplus.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T07:13:44Z\"}"}
