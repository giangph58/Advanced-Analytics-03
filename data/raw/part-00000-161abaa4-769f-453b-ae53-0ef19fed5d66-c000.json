{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17715v1\", \"title\": \"Operational experience and performance of the Silicon Vertex Detector\\n  after the first long shutdown of Belle II\", \"summary\": \"In 2024, the Belle II experiment resumed data taking after the Long Shutdown\\n1, which was required to install a two-layer pixel detector and upgrade\\naccelerator components. We describe the challenges of this shutdown and the\\noperational experience thereafter. With new data, the silicon-strip vertex\\ndetector (SVD) confirmed the high hit efficiency, the large signal-to-noise\\nratio, and the excellent cluster position resolution. In the coming years, the\\nSuperKEKB peak luminosity is expected to increase to its target value,\\nresulting in a larger SVD occupancy caused by beam background. Considerable\\nefforts have been made to improve SVD reconstruction software by exploiting the\\nexcellent SVD hit-time resolution to determine the collision time and reject\\noff-time particle hits. A novel procedure to group SVD hits event-by-event,\\nbased on their time, has been developed using the grouping information during\\nreconstruction, significantly reducing the fake rate while preserving the\\ntracking efficiency. The front-end chip (APV25) is operated in the multi-peak\\nmode, which reads six samples. A 3/6-mixed acquisition mode, based on the\\ntiming precision of the trigger, reduces background occupancy, trigger\\ndead-time, and data size. Studies of the radiation damage show that the SVD\\nperformance will not seriously degrade during the lifetime of the detector,\\ndespite moderate radiation-induced increases in sensor current and strip noise.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T16:17:21Z\"}"}
