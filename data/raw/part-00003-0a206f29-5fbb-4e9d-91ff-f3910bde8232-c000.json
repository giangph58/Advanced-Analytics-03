This poses difficulties in their evaluation.\\nWe introduce a new discrimination measure, time-dependent Uno's C-index, to\\nassess the discrimination performance of non-linear survival models. This is an\\nunbiased version of Antolini's time-dependent concordance. We prove convergence\\nof both measures employing Nolan and Pollard's results on U-statistics. We\\nexplore the relationship between these measures and, in particular, the bias of\\nAntolini's concordance in the presence of censoring using simulated data. We\\ndemonstrate the value of time-dependent Uno's C-index for the evaluation of\\nmodels trained on censored real data and for model tuning.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T03:11:43Z\"}"}
