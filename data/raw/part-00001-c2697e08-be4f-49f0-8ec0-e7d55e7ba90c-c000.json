{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01931v1\", \"title\": \"Review, Refine, Repeat: Understanding Iterative Decoding of AI Agents\\n  with Dynamic Evaluation and Selection\", \"summary\": \"While AI agents have shown remarkable performance at various tasks, they\\nstill struggle with complex multi-modal applications, structured generation and\\nstrategic planning. Improvements via standard fine-tuning is often impractical,\\nas solving agentic tasks usually relies on black box API access without control\\nover model parameters. Inference-time methods such as Best-of-N (BON) sampling\\noffer a simple yet effective alternative to improve performance. However, BON\\nlacks iterative feedback integration mechanism. Hence, we propose Iterative\\nAgent Decoding (IAD) which combines iterative refinement with dynamic candidate\\nevaluation and selection guided by a verifier. IAD differs in how feedback is\\ndesigned and integrated, specifically optimized to extract maximal signal from\\nreward scores. We conduct a detailed comparison of baselines across key metrics\\non Sketch2Code, Text2SQL, and Webshop where IAD consistently outperforms\\nbaselines, achieving 3--6% absolute gains on Sketch2Code and Text2SQL (with and\\nwithout LLM judges) and 8--10% gains on Webshop across multiple metrics. To\\nbetter understand the source of IAD's gains, we perform controlled experiments\\nto disentangle the effect of adaptive feedback from stochastic sampling, and\\nfind that IAD's improvements are primarily driven by verifier-guided\\nrefinement, not merely sampling diversity. We also show that both IAD and BON\\nexhibit inference-time scaling with increased compute when guided by an optimal\\nverifier. Our analysis highlights the critical role of verifier quality in\\neffective inference-time optimization and examines the impact of noisy and\\nsparse rewards on scaling behavior. Together, these findings offer key insights\\ninto the trade-offs and principles of effective inference-time optimization.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T17:40:47Z\"}"}
