{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11090v1\", \"title\": \"Towards global equity in political polarization research\", \"summary\": \"With a folk understanding that political polarization refers to\\nsocio-political divisions within a society, many have proclaimed that we are\\nmore divided than ever. In this account, polarization has been blamed for\\npopulism, the erosion of social cohesion, the loss of trust in the institutions\\nof democracy, legislative dysfunction, and the collective failure to address\\nexistential risks such as Covid-19 or climate change. However, at a global\\nscale there is surprisingly little academic literature which conclusively\\nsupports these claims, with half of all studies being U.S.-focused. Here, we\\nprovide an overview of the global state of research on polarization,\\nhighlighting insights that are robust across countries, those unique to\\nspecific contexts, and key gaps in the literature. We argue that addressing\\nthese gaps is urgent, but has been hindered thus far by systemic and cultural\\nbarriers, such as regionally stratified restrictions on data access and\\nmisaligned research incentives. If continued cross-disciplinary inertia means\\nthat these disparities are left unaddressed, we see a substantial risk that\\ncountries will adopt policies to tackle polarization based on inappropriate\\nevidence, risking flawed decision-making and the weakening of democratic\\ninstitutions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SI\", \"categories\": \"cs.SI,physics.soc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T11:34:12Z\"}"}
