By employing a Lee-Low-Pines-like\\ntransformation combined with a multireference configuration approach, we\\nself-consistently account for the molecule's backaction on the superfluid bath\\nand accurately capture the complex entanglement between the molecule's\\nrotational degrees of freedom and the bath excitations. Our findings reveal\\nthat, in the ground state, the impurity induces a density defect in the\\nsuperfluid bath, giving rise to two novel types of excited states: (a)\\nattractive angulon states, analogous to bound states in photonic crystals and\\nYu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states in superconductors, localized within the density\\ndefect region; and (b) long-lived repulsive angulon states in dilute\\nenvironments. Rotational spectroscopy demonstrates a crossover from repulsive\\nto attractive angulon states as the bath density increases. This work paves the\\nway for exploring novel nonequilibrium phenomena of quantum impurities in\\ninteracting environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas,physics.atom-ph,physics.chem-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T12:34:55Z\"}"}
