By resorting to this flow, we investigate the regulator and gauge\\ndependence in quantum Einstein gravity within the asymptotic safety framework,\\nconsidering various regularization schemes. Our findings indicate that some\\ndetails of the regulator have minor influence on the critical properties of the\\ntheory. In contrast, the selection between linear and exponential\\nparametrizations appears to have a more substantial impact on the scaling\\nbehavior of the renormalized flow near the non-Gaussian fixed point.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:52:31Z\"}"}
