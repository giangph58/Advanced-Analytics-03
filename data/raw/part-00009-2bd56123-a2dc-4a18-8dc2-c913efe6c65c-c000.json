SAGINs consist of three spatial layer\\nnetwork nodes: 1) satellites on the space layer, 2) aerial vehicles on the\\naerial layer, and 3) ground devices on the ground layer. Data transmissions in\\nSAGINs include six unique cross-spatial-layer scenarios, i.e., three uplink and\\nthree downlink transmissions across three spatial layers. For simplicity, we\\ncall them \\\\textit{six cross-layer scenarios}. Considering the diverse\\ncross-layer scenarios, it is crucial to conduct a unified network modeling\\nregarding node coverage and distributions in all scenarios. To achieve this\\ngoal, we develop a unified modeling approach of coverage regions for all six\\ncross-layer scenarios. Given a receiver in each scenario, its coverage region\\non a transmitter-distributed surface is modeled as a spherical dome. Utilizing\\nspherical geometry, the analytical models of the spherical-dome coverage\\nregions are derived and unified for six cross-layer scenarios. We conduct\\nextensive numerical results to examine the coverage models under varying\\ncarrier frequencies, receiver elevation angles, and transceivers' altitudes.\\nBased on the coverage model, we develop an algorithm to generate node\\ndistributions under spherical coverage regions, which can assist in testing\\nSAGINs before practical implementations.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T03:30:41Z\"}"}
