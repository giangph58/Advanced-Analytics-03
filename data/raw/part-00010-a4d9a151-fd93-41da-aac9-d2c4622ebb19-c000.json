{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11890v1\", \"title\": \"A Novel Jet Model for the Novikov-Thorne Disk and its Observable Impact\", \"summary\": \"Recent high-resolution observations have established a strong link between\\nblack hole jets and accretion disk structures, particularly in the 3.5 mm\\nwavelength band [Nature. 616, 686 (2023)]. In this work, we propose a\\n``jet-modified Novikov-Thorne disk model'' that explicitly incorporates jet\\nluminosity into the accretion disk radiation framework. By integrating\\nsynchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons in the jet, we derive a\\nmodified luminosity function that accounts for both the accretion disk and jet\\ncontributions. Our analysis demonstrates that the inclusion of jet luminosity\\nenhances the total accretion disk luminosity by approximately 33.5\\\\%, as\\nderived from the integration of radiative flux. Furthermore, we compare our\\nmodified model with the standard Novikov-Thorne model and find that the jet\\ncontribution remains significant across different observational inclinations.\\nThese results highlight the necessity of incorporating jet effects when\\nestimating the observable flux of black hole accretion systems, which has\\ndirect implications for future astronomical observations.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T09:17:57Z\"}"}
