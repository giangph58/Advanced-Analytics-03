New Results Using the\\n  Time-Distance Deep-Focus Method\", \"summary\": \"We re-examine the deep-focus methodology of time-distance helioseismology\\npreviously used to estimate the power spectrum of the solar convection at a\\ndepth of about 30 Mm, which was found to be significantly weaker than predicted\\nby theory and simulations. The Global Acoustic, Linearized Euler (GALE) and\\nEulerian Lagrangian (EULAG) codes are used to generate ground-truth simulations\\nthrough which the accuracy of the convective power spectrum can be evaluated.\\nThis validation process shows that the power spectrum diverges significantly\\nfrom ground truth beyond spatial scales corresponding to the spherical harmonic\\ndegree $\\\\ell=15$ - $30$ because of the limited resolution of helioseismic\\nmeasurements. However, the power estimated at larger spatial scales ($\\\\ell<15$)\\nis sufficiently accurate. We then apply the methodology to solar data and find\\na spectrum that is substantially stronger than previously reported. We discuss\\nsome possible differences in methodology that might have led to the initial\\nunder-estimation of solar convective power. The new spectra are in line with\\nrecent hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic simulations of solar convection and\\nalso consistent with the previous inferences obtained by the ring-diagram\\nlocal-helioseismology method.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T17:45:17Z\"}"}
