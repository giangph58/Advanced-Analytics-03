Here, we extend the scope of thin film ENZ modes by elucidating the\\ngeneralized polaritonic modes emerging from anisotropy and near-zero\\npermittivity. Through a theoretical investigation of generalized ENZ polaritons\\non silicon carbide (SiC) metasurfaces, we reveal a complex polaritonic\\nlandscape, consisting of a seven-region phase diagram. We show that the complex\\ninterplay between material properties and geometry changes the nature of the\\nmodes, and we clarify when ENZ modes with closed and open isofrequency curves\\n(IFCs) can be observed, and how they coexist with surface phonon-polaritons and\\nhyperbolic modes. The associated photonic topological transitions are\\naccompanied by phase velocity sign reversals and induce dramatic modifications\\nof near-field profiles and Purcell enhancement factors. Our work merges\\ninsights from anisotropic and ENZ effects, enabling enhanced control over\\npolariton behavior with broad implications for subwavelength optics, material\\ndesign, nonlinear effects, thermal emission, and quantum technologies.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T12:57:14Z\"}"}
