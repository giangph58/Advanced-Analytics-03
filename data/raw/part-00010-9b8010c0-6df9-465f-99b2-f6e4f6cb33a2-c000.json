{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20409v1\", \"title\": \"GarmentX: Autoregressive Parametric Representations for High-Fidelity 3D\\n  Garment Generation\", \"summary\": \"This work presents GarmentX, a novel framework for generating diverse,\\nhigh-fidelity, and wearable 3D garments from a single input image. Traditional\\ngarment reconstruction methods directly predict 2D pattern edges and their\\nconnectivity, an overly unconstrained approach that often leads to severe\\nself-intersections and physically implausible garment structures. In contrast,\\nGarmentX introduces a structured and editable parametric representation\\ncompatible with GarmentCode, ensuring that the decoded sewing patterns always\\nform valid, simulation-ready 3D garments while allowing for intuitive\\nmodifications of garment shape and style. To achieve this, we employ a masked\\nautoregressive model that sequentially predicts garment parameters, leveraging\\nautoregressive modeling for structured generation while mitigating\\ninconsistencies in direct pattern prediction. Additionally, we introduce\\nGarmentX dataset, a large-scale dataset of 378,682 garment parameter-image\\npairs, constructed through an automatic data generation pipeline that\\nsynthesizes diverse and high-quality garment images conditioned on parametric\\ngarment representations. Through integrating our method with GarmentX dataset,\\nwe achieve state-of-the-art performance in geometric fidelity and input image\\nalignment, significantly outperforming prior approaches. We will release\\nGarmentX dataset upon publication.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T04:15:33Z\"}"}
