To strike a good\\nbalance across multiple QoR of interest (e.g., performance, power, and area),\\nthe designers need to navigate a vast design space, encompassing tunable\\nparameters for both hardware generator and EDA synthesis tools. However, the\\nsignificant time for EDA tool invocations and complex interplay among numerous\\ndesign parameters make this task extremely challenging, even for experienced\\ndesigners. To address these challenges, we introduce DiffuSE, a\\ndiffusion-driven design space exploration framework for cross-layer\\noptimization of DNN accelerators. DiffuSE leverages conditional diffusion\\nmodels to capture the inverse, one-to-many mapping from QoR objectives to\\nparameter combinations, allowing for targeted exploration within promising\\nregions of the design space. By carefully selecting the conditioning QoR\\nvalues, the framework facilitates an effective trade-off among multiple QoR\\nmetrics in a sample-efficient manner. Experimental results under 7nm technology\\ndemonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework compared to previous\\narts.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AR\", \"categories\": \"cs.AR\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T10:50:00Z\"}"}
