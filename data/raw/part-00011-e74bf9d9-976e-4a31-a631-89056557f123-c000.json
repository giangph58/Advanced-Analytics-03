Neural networks are able to analyze satellite acquisitions and\\ndetermine which areas were affected by a catastrophic event. The problem in\\ntheir development in this context is the data scarcity and the lack of\\nextensive benchmark datasets, limiting the capabilities of training large\\nneural network models. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology, namely\\nMagnifier, to improve segmentation performance with limited data availability.\\nThe Magnifier methodology is applicable to any existing encoder-decoder\\narchitecture, as it extends a model by merging information at different\\ncontextual levels through a dual-encoder approach: a local and global encoder.\\nMagnifier analyzes the input data twice using the dual-encoder approach. In\\nparticular, the local and global encoders extract information from the same\\ninput at different granularities. This allows Magnifier to extract more\\ninformation than the other approaches given the same set of input images.\\nMagnifier improves the quality of the results of +2.65% on average IoU while\\nleading to a restrained increase in terms of the number of trainable parameters\\ncompared to the original model. We evaluated our proposed approach with\\nstate-of-the-art burned area segmentation models, demonstrating, on average,\\ncomparable or better performances in less than half of the GFLOPs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,eess.IV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T08:51:54Z\"}"}
