{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02535v1\", \"title\": \"High Numerical Aperture Achromatic Meta-Devices through Dispersion\\n  Compensation\", \"summary\": \"Dispersion engineering is a long-standing challenge in optical systems, and\\nit is particularly important for metasurfaces, which naturally suffer from\\nstrong chromatic aberrations due to their ultralow profile. Stacks of\\nmetasurfaces have recently implemented dispersion control to address these\\nchallenges. However, these approaches still suffer from bottlenecks in terms of\\nthe available material refractive index and required aspect ratios, resulting\\nin limited phase and group delay coverage, constraining their numerical\\naperture (NA), size and operating bandwidth. To address these challenges, we\\nexplore a dispersion compensation strategy combined with full-wave\\nsimulation-free inverse design to implement ultra-high NA, broadband dispersion\\ncontrol in metasurfaces, not requiring large refractive index materials and\\nhigh aspect ratio processing technology. We experimentally demonstrate multiple\\nmeta-devices with highly customized dispersion engineering in the microwave\\nregime, including broadband achromatic diffraction-limited meta-devices with\\nNA=0.98 and 60% fractional bandwidth. Our proposed platform explores a paradigm\\nfor dispersion control with metasurfaces, which may facilitate advanced and\\nscalable dispersion functionalities.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.app-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T12:37:25Z\"}"}
