In order to employ a Lagrangian framework, we prove that\\nthe value of the saddle point that characterizes the optimal lottery is the\\nsame as the value of the dual of the deterministic problem. Our algorithm\\nsolves the dual of the deterministic problem via sub-gradient descent. We prove\\nthat the optimal lottery can be directly computed from the deterministic optima\\nthat occur along the iterations. We analyze the computational complexity of our\\nalgorithm and show that the worst-case complexity is often orders of magnitude\\nbetter than the one arising from a linear programming approach. We apply the\\nmethod to two canonical problems with private information. First, we solve a\\nprincipal-agent moral-hazard problem, demonstrating that our approach delivers\\nsubstantial improvements in speed and scalability over traditional linear\\nprogramming methods. Second, we study an optimal taxation problem with hidden\\ntypes, which was previously considered computationally infeasible, and examine\\nunder which conditions the optimal contract will involve lotteries.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.TH\", \"categories\": \"econ.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T16:03:09Z\"}"}
