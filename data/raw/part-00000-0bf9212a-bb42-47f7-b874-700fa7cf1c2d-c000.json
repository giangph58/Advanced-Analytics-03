The resulting family of effective\\nHamiltonians reproduces the well-known Floquet-Magnus expansion, now enhanced\\nwith explicit error bounds that quantify the distance between the exact and\\napproximate dynamics at each order, even in cases where the Floquet-Magnus\\nseries fails to converge. We apply the method to the semiclassical Rabi model\\nand provide explicit error bounds for both the Bloch-Siegert Hamiltonian and\\nits third-order refinement. Our analysis shows that, while the rotating-wave\\napproximation more accurately captures the true dynamics than the Bloch-Siegert\\nHamiltonian in most regimes, the third-order approximation ultimately\\noutperforms both.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T08:27:21Z\"}"}
