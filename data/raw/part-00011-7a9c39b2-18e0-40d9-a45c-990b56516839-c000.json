If one flagellum reverses its rotational direction, it leaves the\\nbundle, performs a polymorphic transformation, and the bacterium tumbles. The\\nE. coli bacterium is hydrodynamically attracted to surfaces. This prolongs its\\nresidence time, while tumbling facilitates surface detachment. We develop a\\nmodel of E. coli that uses an extended Kirchhoff rod theory to implement\\nflagellar flexibility as well as different polymorphic conformations and\\nperform hydrodynamic simulations with the method of multiparticle collision\\ndynamics (MPCD). To establish a reference case, we determine the distribution\\nof tumble angles in the bulk fluid, which shows good agreement with experiments\\nfor a fixed tumble time. Increasing the hook stiffness, narrows the tumble\\nangle distribution and reduces the flagellar dispersion during tumbling. Close\\nto a bounding surface, the tumble angle distribution is shifted to smaller\\nangles, while flagellar dispersion is reduced. Reorientation within the plane\\nfavors the forward direction, which might be an explanation for prolonged run\\ntimes observed in experiments\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,physics.bio-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T16:09:10Z\"}"}
