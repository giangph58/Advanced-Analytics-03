In photonic\\ncrystal slabs, far-field emission from guided resonances naturally provides a\\nnon-invasive way to probe the embedded wavefunctions, raising the question of\\nhow the information carried by escaping photons relates to the band topology.\\nWe develop a non-Hermitian model to describe the guided and leaky modes of\\nphotonic crystal slabs with long-range couplings and non-local responses.\\nWithin this framework, radiation Berry curvature is defined from the far-field\\npolarization and compared to the conventional bulk Berry curvature of the\\ncrystal Bloch modes. We investigate this bulk-radiation correspondence in the\\nvicinity of the $\\\\Gamma$-point of the square lattice and the $K$-point of the\\nhoneycomb lattice. The results show that the comparability between the bulk\\ntopology and the radiation topology is not universal; the validity is\\ncontingent upon the specific bulk Bloch states. Notably, the correspondence\\ncompletely breaks down surrounding the far-field singularities, while it can\\nhold in smooth regions under special symmetry conditions, e.g., rotational\\nsymmetry. Besides, net Berry curvature concentration is captured at the valleys\\nof the non-local honeycomb lattice, facilitating further exploration on\\ngeneralized topological phases in photonic lattices beyond the regimes with\\nlocalized couplings and Hermiticity.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T15:40:02Z\"}"}
