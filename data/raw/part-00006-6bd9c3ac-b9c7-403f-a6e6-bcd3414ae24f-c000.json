Recent\\nstudies have suggested that supratransmission in a damped-driven Klein-Gordon\\nequation can lead to the formation of rogue waves. In this work, we reduce the\\nsame model to a damped and driven discrete nonlinear Schr\\\\\\\"odinger equation and\\ndemonstrate that the claimed rogue waves are unstable solitons exhibiting\\nbreathing dynamics. Through extensive numerical simulations, we thoroughly\\ninvestigate and analyze the behavior of solitons and supratransmission in these\\nlattices. Additionally, we perform asymptotic analysis to explain the\\nunderlying mechanism responsible for supratransmission. Our findings provide\\nnew insights into the dynamics of nonlinear waves and their stability in such\\nsystems.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.PS\", \"categories\": \"nlin.PS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:39:34Z\"}"}
