{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11860v1\", \"title\": \"From Data Behavior to Code Analysis: A Multimodal Study on Security and\\n  Privacy Challenges in Blockchain-Based DApp\", \"summary\": \"The recent proliferation of blockchain-based decentralized applications\\n(DApp) has catalyzed transformative advancements in distributed systems, with\\nextensive deployments observed across financial, entertainment, media, and\\ncybersecurity domains. These trustless architectures, characterized by their\\ndecentralized nature and elimination of third-party intermediaries, have\\ngarnered substantial institutional attention. Consequently, the escalating\\nsecurity challenges confronting DApp demand rigorous scholarly investigation.\\nThis study initiates with a systematic analysis of behavioral patterns derived\\nfrom empirical DApp datasets, establishing foundational insights for subsequent\\nmethodological developments. The principal security vulnerabilities in\\nEthereum-based smart contracts developed via Solidity are then critically\\nexamined. Specifically, reentrancy vulnerability attacks are addressed by\\nformally representing contract logic using highly expressive code fragments.\\nThis enables precise source code-level detection via bidirectional long\\nshort-term memory networks with attention mechanisms (BLSTM-ATT). Regarding\\nprivacy preservation challenges, contemporary solutions are evaluated through\\ndual analytical lenses: identity privacy preservation and transaction anonymity\\nenhancement, while proposing future research trajectories in cryptographic\\nobfuscation techniques.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T08:30:43Z\"}"}
