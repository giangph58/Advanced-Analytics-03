The nature of SW1's many outbursts,\\nwhich regularly brighten the comet by five magnitudes or more, and what\\nprocesses power them has been of particular interest since SW1's discovery in\\nthe 1920s. In this paper, we present and model four epochs of low-resolution\\nnear-infrared spectroscopy of SW1 taken with the NASA Infrared Telescope\\nFacility and Lowell Discovery Telescope between 2017 and 2022. This dataset\\nincludes one large outburst, two periods of low activity (\\\"quiescence\\\" or\\n\\\"quiescent activity\\\"), and one mid-sized outburst a few days after one of the\\nquiescent observations. The two quiescent epochs appear similar in both\\nspectral slope and modeled grain size distributions, but the two outbursts are\\nsignificantly different. We propose that the two can be reconciled if smaller\\ndust grains are accelerated more than larger ones, such that observations\\ncloser to the onset of an outburst are more sensitive to the finer-grained dust\\non the outside of the expanding cloud of material. These outbursts can thus\\nappear very rapid but there is still a period in which the dust and gas are\\nwell-coupled. We find no strong evidence of water ice absorption in any of our\\nspectra, suggesting that the areal abundance of ice-dominated grains is less\\nthan one percent. We conclude with a discussion of future modeling and\\nmonitoring efforts which might be able to further advance our understanding of\\nthis object's complicated activity patterns.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T14:00:49Z\"}"}
