{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19520v1\", \"title\": \"Maximizing Infrared Transmission Contrast Upon Phase Transition of\\n  Thermally Grown Vanadium Dioxide Thin Films by Rapid Thermal Processing\", \"summary\": \"Pristine vanadium dioxide (VO2), an insulator-to-metal transition (IMT)\\nmaterial, is grown via furnace oxidation followed by rapid thermal annealing\\nwith forming gas (5%H2/95%N2) which reduces surface over-oxides such as V2O5\\nformed during the oxidation. The evolutional IMT behaviors of the thermochromic\\nfilm and vanadium oxide states over different reduction time are systematically\\nstudied with temperature-dependent infrared spectrometry, electrical\\nresistivity, and X-ray diffraction measurements. After optimally reducing\\nsurface over-oxides to VO2, infrared transmission contrast upon phase\\ntransition is enhanced to 46% (at 9 um wavelength) compared to 23% from fully\\noxidation without any reduction. Moreover, pristine VO2 thin film obtained from\\nthermal oxidation and optimal reduction processes exhibits sharp phase\\ntransition and narrow thermal hysteresis within 2~4{\\\\deg}C in both infrared\\ntransmission and electrical resistivity, which are comparable to the VO2 of\\nbest quality prepared by other sophisticated fabrication techniques. The\\nthermally grown method presented here would facilitate the scalable fabrication\\nof high-quality VO2 thin films and tunable radiative coatings for\\nhigh-performance thermal control applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T06:38:51Z\"}"}
