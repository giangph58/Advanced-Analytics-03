Our results demonstrate that this loading has a significant impact in\\nhigher-order scaling regimes, namely those associated with von K\\\\'arm\\\\'an-type\\ntheories, where a nontrivial interplay arises between the elastic energy and\\nthe pressure term. In contrast, we rigorously show that in lower-order bending\\nregimes, as described by Kirchhoff-type theories, the pressure load does not\\ninfluence the minimizers. Finally, after identifying the corresponding\\n$\\\\Gamma$-limit, we conjecture that a similar independence from the pressure\\nterm persists in the most flexible membrane regimes.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T12:59:36Z\"}"}
