Despite their\\nsuccess and breadth of adoption, the approach and structure of these models\\nremain surprisingly siloed by field. Given the siloed nature of their\\ndevelopment and widespread use, one persistent assumption is that a given\\ncontagion can be studied in isolation, independently from what else might be\\nspreading in the population. In reality, countless contagions of biological and\\nsocial nature interact within hosts (interacting with existing beliefs, or the\\nimmune system) and across hosts (interacting in the environment, or affecting\\ntransmission mechanisms). Additionally, from a modeling perspective, we know\\nthat relaxing these assumptions has profound effects on the physics and\\ntranslational implications of the models. Here, we review mechanisms for\\ninteractions in social and biological contagions, as well as the models and\\nframeworks developed to include these interactions in the study of the\\ncontagions. We highlight existing problems related to the inference of\\ninteractions and to the scalability of mathematical models and identify\\npromising avenues of future inquiries. In doing so, we highlight the need for\\ninterdisciplinary efforts under a unified science of contagions and for\\nremoving a common dichotomy between social and biological contagions.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph,q-bio.PE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T12:26:27Z\"}"}
