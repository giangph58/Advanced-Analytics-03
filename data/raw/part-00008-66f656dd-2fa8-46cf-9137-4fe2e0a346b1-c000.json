Likewise, Social Choice Theory, a branch\\nof Welfare Economics, contains several impossibility results that place limits\\non the potential fairness, rationality and consistency of social\\ndecision-making processes. A formal relationship between G\\\\\\\"odel's\\nIncompleteness Theorems in formal logic, and Arrow's Impossibility Theorem in\\nSocial Choice Theory has long been conjectured. In this paper, we address this\\ngap by bringing these two theories closer by introducing a general mathematical\\nobject called a Self-Reference System. Impossibility in Social Choice Theory is\\ndemonstrated to correspond to the impossibility of a Self-Reference System to\\ninterpret its own internal consistency. We also provide a proof of G\\\\\\\"odel's\\nFirst Incompleteness Theorem in the same terms. Together, this recasts Arrow's\\nImpossibility Theorem as incomputability in the G\\\\\\\"odelian sense. The\\nincomputability results in both fields are shown to arise out of\\nself-referential paradoxes. This is exemplified by a new proof of Arrow's\\nImpossibility Theorem centred around Condorcet Paradoxes.\", \"main_category\": \"math.LO\", \"categories\": \"math.LO,cs.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T05:35:44Z\"}"}
