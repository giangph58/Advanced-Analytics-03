{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19990v1\", \"title\": \"Mitigating Societal Cognitive Overload in the Age of AI: Challenges and\\n  Directions\", \"summary\": \"Societal cognitive overload, driven by the deluge of information and\\ncomplexity in the AI age, poses a critical challenge to human well-being and\\nsocietal resilience. This paper argues that mitigating cognitive overload is\\nnot only essential for improving present-day life but also a crucial\\nprerequisite for navigating the potential risks of advanced AI, including\\nexistential threats. We examine how AI exacerbates cognitive overload through\\nvarious mechanisms, including information proliferation, algorithmic\\nmanipulation, automation anxieties, deregulation, and the erosion of meaning.\\nThe paper reframes the AI safety debate to center on cognitive overload,\\nhighlighting its role as a bridge between near-term harms and long-term risks.\\nIt concludes by discussing potential institutional adaptations, research\\ndirections, and policy considerations that arise from adopting an\\noverload-resilient perspective on human-AI alignment, suggesting pathways for\\nfuture exploration rather than prescribing definitive solutions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:06:30Z\"}"}
