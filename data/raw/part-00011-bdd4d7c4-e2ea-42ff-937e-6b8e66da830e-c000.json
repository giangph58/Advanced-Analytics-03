We introduce a unified design framework based on maximizing a\\nMutual Information Upper Bound (MIUB), which inherently reconciles the\\ntrade-off between detection sensitivity and estimation precision without\\nrelying on ad hoc weighting schemes. To model realistic, potentially\\nnon-Gaussian statistics of target returns and clutter, we adopt Gaussian\\nMixture Distributions (GMDs), enabling analytically tractable approximations of\\nthe MIUB's constituent Kullback-Leibler divergence and mutual information\\nterms. To address the resulting non-convex problem, we propose the Phase-Coded\\nDream Optimization Algorithm (PC-DOA), a tailored metaheuristic that leverages\\nhybrid initialization and adaptive exploration-exploitation mechanisms\\nspecifically designed for phase-variable optimization. Numerical simulations\\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving modestly\\nbetter detection-estimation trade-off.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T05:17:45Z\"}"}
