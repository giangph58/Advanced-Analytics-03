Our results\\ndemonstrate that dislocation patterning induces anisotropic flat bands in the\\nelectronic dispersion under specific strain fields and directions, referred to\\nas ``magic'' parameters. These flat bands acquire non-zero curvature as the\\nstrain or direction deviates from these magic parameters.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T16:18:35Z\"}"}
