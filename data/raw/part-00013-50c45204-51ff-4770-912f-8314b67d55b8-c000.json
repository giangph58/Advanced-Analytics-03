In contrast to the\\ntwo-dimensional case, a generalized ''magnetic'' Faber-Krahn inequality does\\nnot hold and the minimizers are not expected to be balls when the magnetic\\nfield is turned on. An analysis of the problem among cylindrical domains\\nreveals geometric constraints for general minimizers. In particular, minimizers\\nmust elongate with a certain rate along the direction of the magnetic field as\\nthe field strength increases. In addition to the theoretical analysis, we\\npresent numerical minimizers which confirm this prediction and give rise to\\nfurther conjectures.\", \"main_category\": \"math-ph\", \"categories\": \"math-ph,math.AP,math.MP,math.OC,math.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T12:55:14Z\"}"}
