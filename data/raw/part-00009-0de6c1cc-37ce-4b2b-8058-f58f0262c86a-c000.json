{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13159v1\", \"title\": \"Digital Twin Generation from Visual Data: A Survey\", \"summary\": \"This survey explores recent developments in generating digital twins from\\nvideos. Such digital twins can be used for robotics application, media content\\ncreation, or design and construction works. We analyze various approaches,\\nincluding 3D Gaussian Splatting, generative in-painting, semantic segmentation,\\nand foundation models highlighting their advantages and limitations.\\nAdditionally, we discuss challenges such as occlusions, lighting variations,\\nand scalability, as well as potential future research directions. This survey\\naims to provide a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art methodologies and\\ntheir implications for real-world applications.
