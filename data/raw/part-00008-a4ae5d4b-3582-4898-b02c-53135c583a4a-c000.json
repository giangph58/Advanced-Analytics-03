We study the problem where the system is subject to\\nprobabilistic uncertainty and described by a hidden Markov model. A stream of\\nobservations is then unsafe if the probability of being in an unsafe state is\\nabove a threshold. A correct monitor recognizes the set of unsafe observations.\\nThe key contribution of this paper is the first correct-by-construction\\nsynthesis method for such monitors, represented as finite automata. The\\ncontribution combines four ingredients: First, we establish the coNP-hardness\\nof checking whether an automaton is a correct monitor, i.e., a monitor without\\nmisclassifications. Second, we provide a reduction that reformulates the search\\nfor misclassifications into a standard probabilistic system synthesis problem.\\nThird, we integrate the verification routine into an active automata learning\\nroutine to synthesize correct monitors. Fourth, we provide a prototypical\\nimplementation that shows the feasibility and limitations of the approach on a\\nseries of benchmarks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.FL\", \"categories\": \"cs.FL,cs.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:23:20Z\"}"}
