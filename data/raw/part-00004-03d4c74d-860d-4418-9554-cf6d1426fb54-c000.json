We investigate this\\nresonant behavior and demonstrate that near exceptional points, the two modes\\nare just different covers of the same complex function on a Riemann surface. We\\nalso study the characteristic time domain signal due to the resonance in the\\nfrequency domain, illustrating the analogy between black hole signals at\\nresonance and harmonic oscillators driven by a resonant external force. We\\ncarry out a numerical study of resonances between the fundamental mode and the\\nfirst overtone in a specific toy model. We find that quasinormal mode\\nfrequencies will not be accurately constrained unless we take into account the\\neffect of resonances.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:12:04Z\"}"}
