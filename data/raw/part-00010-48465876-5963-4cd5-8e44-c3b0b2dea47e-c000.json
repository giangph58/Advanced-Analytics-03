{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06799v1\", \"title\": \"Compatibility of Missing Data Handling Methods across the Stages of\\n  Producing Clinical Prediction Models\", \"summary\": \"Missing data is a challenge when developing, validating and deploying\\nclinical prediction models (CPMs). Traditionally, decisions concerning missing\\ndata handling during CPM development and validation havent accounted for\\nwhether missingness is allowed at deployment. We hypothesised that the missing\\ndata approach used during model development should optimise model performance\\nupon deployment, whilst the approach used during model validation should yield\\nunbiased predictive performance estimates upon deployment; we term this\\ncompatibility. We aimed to determine which combinations of missing data\\nhandling methods across the CPM life cycle are compatible. We considered\\nscenarios where CPMs are intended to be deployed with missing data allowed or\\nnot, and we evaluated the impact of that choice on earlier modelling decisions.\\nThrough a simulation study and an empirical analysis of thoracic surgery data,\\nwe compared CPMs developed and validated using combinations of complete case\\nanalysis, mean imputation, single regression imputation, multiple imputation,\\nand pattern sub-modelling. If planning to deploy a CPM without allowing missing\\ndata, then development and validation should use multiple imputation when\\nrequired. Where missingness is allowed at deployment, the same imputation\\nmethod must be used during development and validation. Commonly used\\ncombinations of missing data handling methods result in biased predictive\\nperformance estimates.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T11:45:10Z\"}"}
