{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15939v1\", \"title\": \"Full Crystallographic Imaging of Hexagonal Boron Nitride Monolayers with\\n  Phonon-Enhanced Sum-Frequency Microscopy\", \"summary\": \"Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an important 2D material for van der Waals\\nheterostructures, single photon emitters, and infrared nanophotonics. The\\noptical characterization of mono- and few-layer samples of hBN however remains\\na challenge as the material is almost invisible optically. Here we introduce\\nphase-resolved sum-frequency microscopy as a technique for imaging monolayers\\nof hBN grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and visualize their crystal\\norientation. A combination of femtosecond mid-infrared (IR) and visible laser\\npulses is used for sum-frequency generation (SFG), which is imaged in a\\nwide-field optical microscope. The IR laser resonantly excites a phonon of hBN\\nthat leads to an ~800-fold enhancement of the SFG intensity, making it possible\\nto image large 100x100 {\\\\mu}m2 sample areas in less than 1 s. Implementing\\nheterodyne detection in combination with azimuthal rotation of the sample\\nfurther provides full crystallographic information. Through combined knowledge\\nof topography and crystal orientation, we find that triangular domains of\\nCVD-grown monolayer hBN have nitrogen-terminated zigzag edges. Overall, SFG\\nmicroscopy can be used as an ultra-sensitive tool to image crystal structure,\\nstrain, stacking sequences, and twist angles, and is applicable to the wide\\nrange of van der Waals structures, where location and identification of\\nmonolayer regions and interfaces with broken inversion symmetry is of paramount\\nimportance.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.mes-hall,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T14:28:30Z\"}"}
