{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15072v1\", \"title\": \"Rhythm of Opinion: A Hawkes-Graph Framework for Dynamic Propagation\\n  Analysis\", \"summary\": \"The rapid development of social media has significantly reshaped the dynamics\\nof public opinion, resulting in complex interactions that traditional models\\nfail to effectively capture. To address this challenge, we propose an\\ninnovative approach that integrates multi-dimensional Hawkes processes with\\nGraph Neural Network, modeling opinion propagation dynamics among nodes in a\\nsocial network while considering the intricate hierarchical relationships\\nbetween comments. The extended multi-dimensional Hawkes process captures the\\nhierarchical structure, multi-dimensional interactions, and mutual influences\\nacross different topics, forming a complex propagation network. Moreover,\\nrecognizing the lack of high-quality datasets capable of comprehensively\\ncapturing the evolution of public opinion dynamics, we introduce a new dataset,\\nVISTA. It includes 159 trending topics, corresponding to 47,207 posts, 327,015\\nsecond-level comments, and 29,578 third-level comments, covering diverse\\ndomains such as politics, entertainment, sports, health, and medicine. The\\ndataset is annotated with detailed sentiment labels across 11 categories and\\nclearly defined hierarchical relationships. When combined with our method, it\\noffers strong interpretability by linking sentiment propagation to the comment\\nhierarchy and temporal evolution. Our approach provides a robust baseline for\\nfuture research.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SI\", \"categories\": \"cs.SI,cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T13:02:30Z\"}"}
