To address this problem, this work presents a different\\nperspective that makes use of a single EMG sensor and brief impulse signals in\\nconjunction with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for accurate pattern detection.\\nConventional techniques rely on real-time data from multiple sensors, which can\\nbe costly and bulky. The method presents high accuracy while lowering hardware\\ncomplexity and expense. A DTW-based system that reliably identifies muscle\\nactivation patterns from short EMG signals was created and tested. Results show\\nthat this single-sensor approach obtained an accuracy rate of 92%, which is\\nsimilar to that of conventional multi-sensor systems. This research provides a\\nmore straightforward and economical approach that can be used to obtain\\nenhanced myoelectric control. These findings provide a different perspective on\\nmore easily accessible and user-friendly prosthetic devices, which will be\\nespecially helpful in disaster-affected areas where quick deployment is\\nessential. Future improvements would investigate this system's dependability\\nover time and wider implementations in real situations, to take prosthetic\\ntechnology one step further.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.bio-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.bio-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T17:35:12Z\"}"}
