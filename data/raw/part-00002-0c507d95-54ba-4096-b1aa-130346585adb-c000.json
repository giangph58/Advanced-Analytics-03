However, the large-scale collection and\\nstorage of raw network traffic pose significant challenges, particularly for\\ncapturing rare cyberattack samples. These challenges hinder the ability to\\nretain comprehensive datasets for model training and future threat detection.\\nTo address this, we propose a machine learning approach guided by formal\\nmethods to encode and reconstruct network data. Our method employs autoencoder\\nmodels with domain-informed penalties to impute PCAP session headers from\\nstructured feature representations. Experimental results demonstrate that\\nincorporating domain knowledge through constraint-based loss terms\\nsignificantly improves reconstruction accuracy, particularly for categorical\\nfeatures with session-level encodings. By enabling efficient reconstruction of\\ndetailed network sessions, our approach facilitates data-efficient model\\ntraining while preserving privacy and storage efficiency.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:51:44Z\"}"}
