ScAlN resonators employ a stack of 90 nm thick 20% Sc\\ndoping ScAlN piezoelectric film on the floating bottom 38 nm thick platinum\\n(Pt) electrode to achieve low losses and high coupling toward centimeter wave\\n(cmWave) frequency band operation. Three fabricated and FBARs are reported,\\nshow promising prospects of ScAlN-Pt stack towards cmWave front-end filters.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:33:46Z\"}"}
