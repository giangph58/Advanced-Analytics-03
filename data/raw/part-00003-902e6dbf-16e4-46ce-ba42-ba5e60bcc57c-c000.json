This characterization extends a well\\nknown result by A. Buan (for abelian categories) to extriangulated categories.\\nAs an application of this result, we get a new equivalent condition to describe\\nsaturated proper classes $\\\\xi$ in $\\\\mathcal{C}$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CT\", \"categories\": \"math.CT,math.RT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T04:33:20Z\"}"}
