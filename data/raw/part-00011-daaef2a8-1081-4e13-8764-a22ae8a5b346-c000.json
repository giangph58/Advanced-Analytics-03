{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05954v1\", \"title\": \"Unsupervised Location Mapping for Narrative Corpora\", \"summary\": \"This work presents the task of unsupervised location mapping, which seeks to\\nmap the trajectory of an individual narrative on a spatial map of locations in\\nwhich a large set of narratives take place. Despite the fundamentality and\\ngenerality of the task, very little work addressed the spatial mapping of\\nnarrative texts. The task consists of two parts: (1) inducing a ``map'' with\\nthe locations mentioned in a set of texts, and (2) extracting a trajectory from\\na single narrative and positioning it on the map. Following recent advances in\\nincreasing the context length of large language models, we propose a pipeline\\nfor this task in a completely unsupervised manner without predefining the set\\nof labels. We test our method on two different domains: (1) Holocaust\\ntestimonies and (2) Lake District writing, namely multi-century literature on\\ntravels in the English Lake District. We perform both intrinsic and extrinsic\\nevaluations for the task, with encouraging results, thereby setting a benchmark\\nand evaluation practices for the task, as well as highlighting challenges.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:06:47Z\"}"}
