{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00372v1\", \"title\": \"Towards Adaptive Self-Normalized Importance Samplers\", \"summary\": \"The self-normalized importance sampling (SNIS) estimator is a Monte Carlo\\nestimator widely used to approximate expectations in statistical signal\\nprocessing and machine learning.\\n  The efficiency of SNIS depends on the choice of proposal, but selecting a\\ngood proposal is typically unfeasible. In particular, most of the existing\\nadaptive IS (AIS) literature overlooks the optimal SNIS proposal.\\n  In this paper, we introduce an AIS framework that uses MCMC to approximate\\nthe optimal SNIS proposal within an iterative scheme. This is, to the best of\\nour knowledge, the first AIS framework targeting specifically the SNIS optimal\\nproposal. We find a close connection with adaptive schemes used in ratio\\nimportance sampling (RIS), which also brings a new perspective and paves the\\nway for combining techniques from AIS and adaptive RIS. We outline possible\\nextensions, connections with existing MCMC-driven AIS algorithms, theoretical\\ndirections, and demonstrate performance in numerical examples.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.CO\", \"categories\": \"stat.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T07:56:02Z\"}"}
