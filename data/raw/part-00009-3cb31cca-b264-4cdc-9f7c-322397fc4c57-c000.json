A searcher faces a set of choices arranged by an\\nobservable attribute. Each period, she either selects a choice and pays a cost\\nto learn about its quality, or she concludes search to take her best discovery\\nto date. She knows that similar choices have similar qualities and uses this to\\nguide her search. We identify robustly optimal search policies with a simple\\nstructure. Search is directional, recall is never invoked, there is a threshold\\nstopping rule, and the policy at each history depends only on a simple index.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.TH\", \"categories\": \"econ.TH,cs.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T12:57:07Z\"}"}
