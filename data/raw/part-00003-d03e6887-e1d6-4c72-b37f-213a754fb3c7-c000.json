{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19816v1\", \"title\": \"Digital Twin-based Out-of-Distribution Detection in Autonomous Vessels\", \"summary\": \"An autonomous vessel (AV) is a complex cyber-physical system (CPS) with\\nsoftware enabling many key functionalities, e.g., navigation software enables\\nan AV to autonomously or semi-autonomously follow a path to its destination.\\nDigital twins of such AVs enable advanced functionalities such as running\\nwhat-if scenarios, performing predictive maintenance, and enabling fault\\ndiagnosis. Due to technological improvements, real-time analyses using\\ncontinuous data from vessels' real-time operations have become increasingly\\npossible. However, the literature has little explored developing advanced\\nanalyses in real-time data in AVs with digital twins built with machine\\nlearning techniques. To this end, we present a novel digital twin-based\\napproach (ODDIT) to detect future out-of-distribution (OOD) states of an AV\\nbefore reaching them, enabling proactive intervention. Such states may indicate\\nanomalies requiring attention (e.g., manual correction by the ship master) and\\nassist testers in scenario-centered testing. The digital twin consists of two\\nmachine-learning models predicting future vessel states and whether the\\npredicted state will be OOD. We evaluated ODDIT with five vessels across\\nwaypoint and zigzag maneuvering under simulated conditions, including sensor\\nand actuator noise and environmental disturbances i.e., ocean current. ODDIT\\nachieved high accuracy in detecting OOD states, with AUROC and TNR@TPR95 scores\\nreaching 99\\\\% across multiple vessels.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.LG,cs.SE,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:12:46Z\"}"}
