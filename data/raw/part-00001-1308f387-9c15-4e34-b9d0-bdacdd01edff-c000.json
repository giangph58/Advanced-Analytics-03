{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19863v1\", \"title\": \"Towards Ball Spin and Trajectory Analysis in Table Tennis Broadcast\\n  Videos via Physically Grounded Synthetic-to-Real Transfer\", \"summary\": \"Analyzing a player's technique in table tennis requires knowledge of the\\nball's 3D trajectory and spin. While, the spin is not directly observable in\\nstandard broadcasting videos, we show that it can be inferred from the ball's\\ntrajectory in the video. We present a novel method to infer the initial spin\\nand 3D trajectory from the corresponding 2D trajectory in a video. Without\\nground truth labels for broadcast videos, we train a neural network solely on\\nsynthetic data. Due to the choice of our input data representation, physically\\ncorrect synthetic training data, and using targeted augmentations, the network\\nnaturally generalizes to real data. Notably, these simple techniques are\\nsufficient to achieve generalization. No real data at all is required for\\ntraining. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present a method\\nfor spin and trajectory prediction in simple monocular broadcast videos,\\nachieving an accuracy of 92.0% in spin classification and a 2D reprojection\\nerror of 0.19% of the image diagonal.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:55:12Z\"}"}
