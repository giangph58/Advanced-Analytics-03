{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05004v1\", \"title\": \"Automated Thoracolumbar Stump Rib Detection and Analysis in a Large CT\\n  Cohort\", \"summary\": \"Thoracolumbar stump ribs are one of the essential indicators of thoracolumbar\\ntransitional vertebrae or enumeration anomalies. While some studies manually\\nassess these anomalies and describe the ribs qualitatively, this study aims to\\nautomate thoracolumbar stump rib detection and analyze their morphology\\nquantitatively. To this end, we train a high-resolution deep-learning model for\\nrib segmentation and show significant improvements compared to existing models\\n(Dice score 0.997 vs. 0.779, p-value < 0.01). In addition, we use an iterative\\nalgorithm and piece-wise linear interpolation to assess the length of the ribs,\\nshowing a success rate of 98.2%. When analyzing morphological features, we show\\nthat stump ribs articulate more posteriorly at the vertebrae (-19.2 +- 3.8 vs\\n-13.8 +- 2.5, p-value < 0.01), are thinner (260.6 +- 103.4 vs. 563.6 +- 127.1,\\np-value < 0.01), and are oriented more downwards and sideways within the first\\ncentimeters in contrast to full-length ribs. We show that with partially\\nvisible ribs, these features can achieve an F1-score of 0.84 in differentiating\\nstump ribs from regular ones. We publish the model weights and masks for public\\nuse.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T07:21:12Z\"}"}
