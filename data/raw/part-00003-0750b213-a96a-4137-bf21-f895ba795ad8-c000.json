However, performance of flexible perovskite/c-silicon\\nmonolithic tandem solar cells still greatly lags, due to challenges in\\nsimultaneously achieving both efficient photocarrier transport and reliable\\nmitigation of residual stress. Here, we reveal the critical role of perovskite\\nphase homogeneity, for achieving high-efficient and mechanical-stable flexible\\nperovskite/c-silicon heterojunction monolithic tandem solar cells (PSTs) with\\ntextured surface. Through ensuring high phase homogeneity, which promotes\\ncharge transfer across all facets of the pyramid on the textured substrates and\\nreleases the residual stress at the perovskite/c-silicon interface, we\\ndemonstrate flexible PSTs with a bending curvature of 0.44 cm-1, and a\\ncertified power conversion efficiency of 29.88% (1.04 cm2 aperture area),\\nsurpassing all other types of flexible perovskite-based photovoltaic devices.\\nOur results can lead to broad applications and commercialization of flexible\\nperovskite/c-silicon tandem photovoltaics.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:38:34Z\"}"}
