Four-loop renormalization of this model\\nis performed with a cutoff regularization in the coordinate representation. The\\ncoefficients for the renormalization constants are found, the applicability of\\nthe $\\\\mathcal{R}$-operation within the proposed regularization is explicitly\\ndemonstrated, and the absence of nonlocal contributions is proved.\\nAdditionally, the explicit form of the singularities, power and logarithmic, as\\nwell as their dependence on the deformation of the Green's function are\\ndiscussed.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T12:16:46Z\"}"}
