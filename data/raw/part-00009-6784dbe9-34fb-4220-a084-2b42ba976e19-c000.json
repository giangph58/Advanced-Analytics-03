{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21568v1\", \"title\": \"A Study on Group Decision Making Problem Based on Fuzzy Reasoning and\\n  Bayesian Networks\", \"summary\": \"Aiming at the group decision - making problem with multi - objective\\nattributes, this study proposes a group decision - making system that\\nintegrates fuzzy inference and Bayesian network. A fuzzy rule base is\\nconstructed by combining threshold values, membership functions, expert\\nexperience, and domain knowledge to address quantitative challenges such as\\nscale differences and expert linguistic variables. A hierarchical Bayesian\\nnetwork is designed, featuring a directed acyclic graph with nodes selected by\\nexperts, and maximum likelihood estimation is used to dynamically optimize the\\nconditional probability table, modeling the nonlinear correlations among\\nmultidimensional indices for posterior probability aggregation. In a\\ncomprehensive student evaluation case, this method is compared with the\\ntraditional weighted scoring approach. The results indicate that the proposed\\nmethod demonstrates effectiveness in both rule criterion construction and\\nranking consistency, with a classification accuracy of 86.0% and an F1 value\\nimprovement of 53.4% over the traditional method. Additionally, computational\\nexperiments on real - world datasets across various group decision scenarios\\nassess the method's performance and robustness, providing evidence of its\\nreliability in diverse contexts.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T12:14:48Z\"}"}
