Using the transfer\\nmatrix method, we prove that the theory is exact if the hard body interaction\\nis additive, only the first neighbors interact and the particles can stick\\ntogether only along the channel. We show that the most convenient treatment of\\nassociation in narrow channels is to work in NPT ensemble, where all structural\\nand thermodynamic quantities can be expressed as a function of pressure and\\nfraction of sites unbonded.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech,cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T12:53:17Z\"}"}
