We first analyze dominant ideals with a fixed least\\ncommon multiple of generators using combinatorial methods. Then, we adopt a\\nprobabilistic approach via the \\\\er\\\\ type model, examining both homogeneous and\\nnon-homogeneous cases. This model offers an efficient alternative to exhaustive\\nenumeration, allowing the study of dominance through small random samples, even\\nin high-dimensional settings.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AC\", \"categories\": \"math.AC,math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T14:56:45Z\"}"}
