{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21518v1\", \"title\": \"Confidential Serverless Computing\", \"summary\": \"Although serverless computing offers compelling cost and deployment\\nsimplicity advantages, a significant challenge remains in securely managing\\nsensitive data as it flows through the network of ephemeral function executions\\nin serverless computing environments within untrusted clouds. While\\nConfidential Virtual Machines (CVMs) offer a promising secure execution\\nenvironment, their integration with serverless architectures currently faces\\nfundamental limitations in key areas: security, performance, and resource\\nefficiency.\\n  We present Hacher, a confidential computing system for secure serverless\\ndeployments to overcome these limitations. By employing nested confidential\\nexecution and a decoupled guest OS within CVMs, Hacher runs each function in a\\nminimal \\\"trustlet\\\", significantly improving security through a reduced Trusted\\nComputing Base (TCB). Furthermore, by leveraging a data-centric I/O\\narchitecture built upon a lightweight LibOS, Hacher optimizes network\\ncommunication to address performance and resource efficiency challenges.\\n  Our evaluation shows that compared to CVM-based deployments, Hacher has 4.3x\\nsmaller TCB, improves end-to-end latency (15-93%), achieves higher function\\ndensity (up to 907x), and reduces inter-function communication (up to 27x) and\\nfunction chaining latency (16.7-30.2x); thus, Hacher offers a practical system\\nfor confidential serverless computing.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.OS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T11:13:52Z\"}"}
