{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21717v1\", \"title\": \"Characterization and optimization of heat engines: Pareto-optimal fronts\\n  and universal features\", \"summary\": \"Characterizing and optimizing nanoscopic heat engines require an appropriate\\nunderstanding of the interplay between power, efficiency, entropy production\\nand fluctuations. Despite significant recent advancements, including linear\\nstochastic thermodynamics and thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs), a\\ncomplete scenario remains elusive. In this work, we give a further step by\\nshowing that, under certain common and general conditions, the heat engine\\nregime can be characterized by the minima of power fluctuations and entropy\\nproduction, which together delimit its optimal performance, achieved when these\\nconditions are fully satisfied. Conversely, when these conditions are not\\nstrictly met, the occurrence of the minimum still approximately describes the\\nsystem, suggesting a broader range of applicability. Contrasting with most of\\nstudies in which the system optimization is carried out solely taking into\\naccount the power and efficiency, we introduce a multi-objective optimization\\nframework based on Pareto fronts, also considering the role of fluctuation and\\ndissipation. Our results reveal a general trend: while simultaneous\\noptimization over a few parameters typically yields convex Pareto fronts, these\\nfronts become concave as more parameters are varied freely and non-conservative\\ndriving becomes significant. Illustrating our findings, we consider simple two\\nand three state systems as well as richer collective systems, exhibiting novel\\naspects of optimizations and protocol phase transitions.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T15:01:17Z\"}"}
