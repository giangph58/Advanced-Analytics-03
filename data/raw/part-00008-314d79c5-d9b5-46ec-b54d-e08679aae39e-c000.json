{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19685v1\", \"title\": \"Tensegrity-based Robot Leg Design with Variable Stiffness\", \"summary\": \"Animals can finely modulate their leg stiffness to interact with complex\\nterrains and absorb sudden shocks. In feats like leaping and sprinting, animals\\ndemonstrate a sophisticated interplay of opposing muscle pairs that actively\\nmodulate joint stiffness, while tendons and ligaments act as biological springs\\nstoring and releasing energy. Although legged robots have achieved notable\\nprogress in robust locomotion, they still lack the refined adaptability\\ninherent in animal motor control. Integrating mechanisms that allow active\\ncontrol of leg stiffness presents a pathway towards more resilient robotic\\nsystems. This paper proposes a novel mechanical design to integrate compliancy\\ninto robot legs based on tensegrity - a structural principle that combines\\nflexible cables and rigid elements to balance tension and compression.\\nTensegrity structures naturally allow for passive compliance, making them\\nwell-suited for absorbing impacts and adapting to diverse terrains. Our design\\nfeatures a robot leg with tensegrity joints and a mechanism to control the\\njoint's rotational stiffness by modulating the tension of the cable actuation\\nsystem. We demonstrate that the robot leg can reduce the impact forces of\\nsudden shocks by at least 34.7 % and achieve a similar leg flexion under a load\\ndifference of 10.26 N by adjusting its stiffness configuration. The results\\nindicate that tensegrity-based leg designs harbors potential towards more\\nresilient and adaptable legged robots.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T11:22:35Z\"}"}
