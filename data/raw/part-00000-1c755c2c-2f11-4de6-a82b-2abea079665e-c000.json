We also\\nprovide a similar regularization for the semidefinite program ''min {Tr(C\\n$\\\\bullet$ X) : A(X) = b; X 0}'' but with now the so-called Von Neumann entropy,\\nas in Quantum Optimal Transport. Importantly, both are not barriers of the LP\\nand SDP cones respectively. We show that this problem admits an equivalent\\nunconstrained convex problem max $\\\\lambda$$\\\\in$R m G$\\\\epsilon$($\\\\lambda$) for\\nan explicit concave differentiable function G$\\\\epsilon$ in dual variables\\n$\\\\lambda$ $\\\\in$ R m . As $\\\\epsilon$ goes to zero, its optimal value converges\\nto the optimal value of the initial LP. While it resembles the log-barrier\\nformulation of interior point algorithm for the initial LP, it has a\\ndistinguishing advantage. Namely for fixed $\\\\lambda$, G$\\\\epsilon$($\\\\lambda$) is\\nobtained as a minimization over the whole space x $\\\\in$ R d (and not over x\\n$\\\\ge$ 0) to still obtain a nonnegative solution x($\\\\lambda$) $\\\\ge$ 0, whence an\\nexplicit form of G$\\\\epsilon$ very useful for its unconstrained maximization\\nover R m.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T07:49:48Z\"}"}
