In this work, we propose ASHiTA, the first framework\\nthat generates a task hierarchy grounded to a 3D scene graph by breaking down\\nhigh-level tasks into grounded subtasks. ASHiTA alternates LLM-assisted\\nhierarchical task analysis, to generate the task breakdown, with task-driven 3D\\nscene graph construction to generate a suitable representation of the\\nenvironment. Our experiments show that ASHiTA performs significantly better\\nthan LLM baselines in breaking down high-level tasks into environment-dependent\\nsubtasks and is additionally able to achieve grounding performance comparable\\nto state-of-the-art methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T03:22:52Z\"}"}
