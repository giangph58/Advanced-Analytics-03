Exact traveling wave solutions are obtained for\\nthe vertex boundary conditions providing mass conservation and continuity of\\nthe solution at the nodes. Constraints for the nonlinearity coefficients\\nensuring integrability of the Burgers equation are derived. Numerical treatment\\nof the soliton dynamics and their transmission through the graph vertex is\\npresented.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.SI\", \"categories\": \"nlin.SI,physics.ao-ph,physics.app-ph,physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T16:30:16Z\"}"}
