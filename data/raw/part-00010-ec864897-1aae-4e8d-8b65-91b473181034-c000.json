Recent security efforts have leveraged the physics-based model to\\ndetect or mitigate sensor attacks. However, these approaches are only resilient\\nto a few sensor attacks and still need improvement in detection effectiveness.\\nWe present VIMU, an efficient sensor attack detection and resilience system for\\nunmanned aerial vehicles. We propose a detection algorithm, CS-EMA, that\\nleverages low-pass filtering to identify stealthy gyroscope attacks while\\nachieving an overall effective sensor attack detection. We develop a\\nfine-grained nonlinear physical model with precise aerodynamic and propulsion\\nwrench modeling. We also augment the state estimation with a FIFO buffer\\nsafeguard to mitigate the impact of high-rate IMU attacks. The proposed\\nphysical model and buffer safeguard provide an effective system state recovery\\ntoward maintaining flight stability. We implement VIMU on PX4 autopilot. The\\nevaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of VIMU in detecting and\\nmitigating various realistic sensor attacks, especially stealthy attacks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T09:20:41Z\"}"}
