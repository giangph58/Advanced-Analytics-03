{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00367v1\", \"title\": \"KoACD: The First Korean Adolescent Dataset for Cognitive Distortion\\n  Analysis\", \"summary\": \"Cognitive distortion refers to negative thinking patterns that can lead to\\nmental health issues like depression and anxiety in adolescents. Previous\\nstudies using natural language processing (NLP) have focused mainly on\\nsmall-scale adult datasets, with limited research on adolescents. This study\\nintroduces KoACD, the first large-scale dataset of cognitive distortions in\\nKorean adolescents, containing 108,717 instances. We applied a multi-Large\\nLanguage Model (LLM) negotiation method to refine distortion classification and\\ngenerate synthetic data using two approaches: cognitive clarification for\\ntextual clarity and cognitive balancing for diverse distortion representation.\\nValidation through LLMs and expert evaluations showed that while LLMs\\nclassified distortions with explicit markers, they struggled with\\ncontext-dependent reasoning, where human evaluators demonstrated higher\\naccuracy. KoACD aims to enhance future research on cognitive distortion\\ndetection.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T07:37:18Z\"}"}
