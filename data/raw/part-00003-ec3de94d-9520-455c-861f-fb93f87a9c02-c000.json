An explicit description of the\\ntangent cone to that variety is given in Theorem 3.2 of Schneider and Uschmajew\\n[SIAM J. Optim., 25 (2015), pp. 622-646]. The present paper shows that the\\nproof therein is incomplete and provides four proofs. It also reviews\\nequivalent descriptions of the tangent cone to that variety. Moreover, it shows\\nthat the tangent cone and the algebraic tangent cone to that variety coincide,\\nwhich is not true for all real algebraic varieties.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:53:48Z\"}"}
