{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09880v1\", \"title\": \"The Universal Gap-to-Critical Temperature Ratio in Superconductors: a\\n  Statistical Mechanical Perspective\", \"summary\": \"We propose a statistical mechanical framework to unify the observed\\nrelationship between the superconducting energy gap $\\\\Delta$, the pseudogap\\n$\\\\Delta^\\\\ast$, and the critical temperature $T_\\\\mathrm{c}$. In this model,\\nfermions couple as a composite boson and condense to occupy a single bound\\nstate as the temperature drops. We derive a concise formula for $T_\\\\mathrm{c}$\\nin terms of $\\\\Delta$ and $\\\\Delta^\\\\ast$, namely: $$\\\\frac{\\\\Delta}{k_\\\\mathrm{B}\\nT_\\\\mathrm{c}} = 1.4+4\\\\log(\\\\Delta^\\\\ast/\\\\Delta).$$ This expression reproduces the\\nstandard BCS gap-to-$T_\\\\mathrm{c}$ ratio in the absence of a pseudogap, while\\nnaturally explaining its enhancement in unconventional superconductors. The\\nmodel is supported by comparisons with experimental data from several cuprates\\nand iron-based superconductors, which highlight its generality. This\\nformulation also offers a theoretical explanation for the observed persistence\\nof the pseudogap phase into the overdoped regime.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T05:04:25Z\"}"}
