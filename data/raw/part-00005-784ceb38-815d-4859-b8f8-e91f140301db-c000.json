To achieve stabilization of\\nunknown networks, we further propose a distributed adaptive tuning rule for\\neach individual gain function, ensuring that all closed-loop trajectories\\nconverge to the origin. The effectiveness of the proposed decentralized\\nadaptive control is verified in a case study on epidemic spreading control in\\nSIS networks with transmission delays.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T04:34:24Z\"}"}
