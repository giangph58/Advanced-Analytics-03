In the Sobolev critical case $p=2\\\\cdot\\n2^*$, the energy functional has no critical point. As for $L^2$-supercritical\\ncase $p \\\\in (4+\\\\frac{4}{N},2\\\\cdot2^*)$: on the one hand, taking into account\\nPohozaev manifold and perturbation method, we obtain the existence of ground\\nstate normalized solutions for the non-radial case; on the other hand, we get\\nthe existence of infinitely many normalized solutions in $H^1_r(\\\\mathbb{R}^N)$.\\nMoreover, our results cover several relevant existing results. And in the end,\\nwe get the asymptotic properties of energy as $a$ tends to $+\\\\infty$ and $a$\\ntends to $0^+$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T05:37:28Z\"}"}
