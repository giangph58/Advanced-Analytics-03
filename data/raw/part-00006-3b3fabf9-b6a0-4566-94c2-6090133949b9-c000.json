As\\na pathfinder for the SiTian project, the Mini-SiTian (MST) has been proposed\\nand implemented to test the SiTian's brain and data pipeline, and to evaluate\\nthe feasibility of its technology and science cases. Mounted at the Xinglong\\nObservatory, the MST project comprises three 30 cm telescopes and has been\\noperated since Nov. 2022. Each telescope of the MST possesses a large field of\\nview, covering $2.29^{\\\\circ}$ $\\\\times$ $1.53^{\\\\circ}$ FOV, and is equipped with\\n$g'$, $r'$ and $i'$ filters, respectively. Acting as the pioneer of the\\nforthcoming SiTian project, the MST is dedicated to the discovery of variable\\nstars, transients, and outburst events, and has already obtained some\\ninteresting scientific results. In this paper, we will summarize the\\nfirst-two-year operation of the MST project.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:26:07Z\"}"}
