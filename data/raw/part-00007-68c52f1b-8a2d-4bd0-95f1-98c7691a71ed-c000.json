The necessary and sufficient\\nconditions for the existence of these contiguity relations are presented first.\\nThese conditions are then solved, yielding a comprehensive list of contiguity\\nrelations for these various families of polynomials. Furthermore, we\\ndemonstrate that all contiguity relations correspond to spectral transforms.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CA\", \"categories\": \"math.CA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:14:50Z\"}"}
