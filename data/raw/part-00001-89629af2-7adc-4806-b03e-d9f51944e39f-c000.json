This is an analogue of the\\ncelebrated result by Bertini and Giacomin from 1997 for the exclusion process\\non a circle with any particle density. The main goal of this article is to\\nanalyse the interacting particle system using the framework of regularity\\nstructures without applying the Gaertner transform, a discrete version of the\\nCole-Hopf transform which linearises the KPZ equation. Our analysis relies on\\ndiscretisation framework for regularity structures developed by Erhard and\\nHairer as well as estimates for iterated integrals with respect to cadlag\\nmartingales derived by Grazieschi, Matetski and Weber. The main technical\\nchallenge addressed in this work is the renormalisation procedure which\\nrequires a subtle analysis of regularity preserving discrete convolution\\noperators.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T15:56:35Z\"}"}
