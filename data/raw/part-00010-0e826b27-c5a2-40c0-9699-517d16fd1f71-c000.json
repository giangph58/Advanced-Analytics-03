One of the\\ncharacteristics of responsible AI systems is their explainability. In the\\npaper, we are interested in explainable deep learning (XDL) systems. On the\\nbasis of the creation of digital twins of physical objects, we introduce the\\nidea of creating readable twins (in the form of imprecise information flow\\nmodels) for unreadable deep learning models. The complete procedure for\\nswitching from the deep learning model (DLM) to the imprecise information flow\\nmodel (IIFM) is presented. The proposed approach is illustrated with an example\\nof a deep learning classification model for image recognition of handwritten\\ndigits from the MNIST data set.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:55:34Z\"}"}
