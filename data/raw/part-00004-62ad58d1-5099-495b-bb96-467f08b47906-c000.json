{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11265v1\", \"title\": \"Evidence of Nonlinear Signatures in Solar Wind Proton Density at the L1\\n  Lagrange point\", \"summary\": \"The solar wind is a medium characterized by strong turbulence and significant\\nfield fluctuations on various scales. Recent observations have revealed that\\nmagnetic turbulence exhibits a self-similar behavior. Similarly,\\nhigh-resolution measurements of the proton density have shown comparable\\ncharacteristics, prompting several studies into the multifractal properties of\\nthese density fluctuations. In this work, we show that low-resolution\\nobservations of the solar wind proton density over time, recorded by various\\nspacecraft at Lagrange point L1, also exhibit non-linear and multifractal\\nstructures. The novelty of our study lies in the fact that this is the first\\nsystematic analysis of solar wind proton density using low-resolution (hourly)\\ndata collected by multiple spacecraft at the L1 Lagrange point over a span of\\n17 years. Furthermore, we interpret our results within the framework of\\nnon-extensive statistical mechanics, which appears to be consistent with the\\nobserved nonlinear behavior. Based on the data, we successfully validate the\\nq-triplet predicted by non-extensive statistical theory. To the best of our\\nknowledge, this represents the most rigorous and systematic validation to date\\nof the q-triplet in the solar wind.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.space-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.space-ph,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.SR,physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:04:52Z\"}"}
