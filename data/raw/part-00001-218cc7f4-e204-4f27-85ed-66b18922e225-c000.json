This entails the need to detect these narratives accurately. To\\naddress this, we introduce the first taxonomy of common misleading narratives\\nthat circulated during recent elections in Europe. Based on this taxonomy, we\\nconstruct and analyse UKElectionNarratives: the first dataset of\\nhuman-annotated misleading narratives which circulated during the UK General\\nElections in 2019 and 2024. We also benchmark Pre-trained and Large Language\\nModels (focusing on GPT-4o), studying their effectiveness in detecting\\nelection-related misleading narratives. Finally, we discuss potential use cases\\nand make recommendations for future research directions using the proposed\\ncodebook and dataset.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T17:51:20Z\"}"}
