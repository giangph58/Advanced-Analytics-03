We study the large time behavior of non-negative solutions\\nand show that the nonlinear term determines the large time asymptotic for\\n$p\\\\leq 1+2/Q,$ while the classical/anomalous diffusion effects win if\\n$p>1+{2}/{Q}$, where $Q=2n+2$ is the homogeneous dimension of $\\\\mathbb{H}^n$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T09:57:53Z\"}"}
