Beginning with\\nthe K\\\\\\\"ahler information geometry of linear systems in the Hardy space and\\nweighted Hardy spaces, we demonstrate that the Dirichlet norm and distance of\\nARMA models, corresponding to the mutual information between the past and\\nfuture, are decomposed into functions of the hyperbolic distance between the\\npoles and zeros of the ARMA models.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T16:12:24Z\"}"}
