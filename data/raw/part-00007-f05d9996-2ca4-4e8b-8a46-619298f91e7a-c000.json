{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04984v1\", \"title\": \"Rethinking the Relationship between the Power Law and Hierarchical\\n  Structures\", \"summary\": \"Statistical analysis of corpora provides an approach to quantitatively\\ninvestigate natural languages. This approach has revealed that several power\\nlaws consistently emerge across different corpora and languages, suggesting the\\nuniversal principles underlying languages. Particularly, the power-law decay of\\ncorrelation has been interpreted as evidence for underlying hierarchical\\nstructures in syntax, semantics, and discourse. This perspective has also been\\nextended to child languages and animal signals. However, the argument\\nsupporting this interpretation has not been empirically tested. To address this\\nproblem, this study examines the validity of the argument for syntactic\\nstructures. Specifically, we test whether the statistical properties of parse\\ntrees align with the implicit assumptions in the argument. Using English\\ncorpora, we analyze the mutual information, deviations from probabilistic\\ncontext-free grammars (PCFGs), and other properties in parse trees, as well as\\nin the PCFG that approximates these trees. Our results indicate that the\\nassumptions do not hold for syntactic structures and that it is difficult to\\napply the proposed argument to child languages and animal signals, highlighting\\nthe need to reconsider the relationship between the power law and hierarchical\\nstructures.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T06:41:46Z\"}"}
