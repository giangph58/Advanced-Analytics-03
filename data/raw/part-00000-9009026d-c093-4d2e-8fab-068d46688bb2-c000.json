We find performance gains from 17% to 53% on a random subset of SWE\\nBench Verified, with additional performance gains on LiveCodeBench, as well as\\nsynthetically generated agent benchmarks. Our work represents an advancement in\\nthe automated and open-ended design of agentic systems, and provides a\\nreference agent framework for those seeking to post-train LLMs on tool use and\\nother agentic tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T16:58:18Z\"}"}
