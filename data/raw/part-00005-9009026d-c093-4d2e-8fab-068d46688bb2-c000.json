{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15233v1\", \"title\": \"A Review on Privacy in DAG-Based DLTs\", \"summary\": \"Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs)\\nhave emerged as a promising solution to the scalability issues inherent in\\ntraditional blockchains. However, amidst the focus on scalability, the crucial\\naspect of privacy within DAG-based DLTs has been largely overlooked. This paper\\nseeks to address this gap by providing a comprehensive examination of privacy\\nnotions and challenges within DAG-based DLTs. We delve into potential\\nmethodologies to enhance privacy within these systems, while also analyzing the\\nassociated hurdles and real-world implementations within state-of-the-art\\nDAG-based DLTs. By exploring these methodologies, we not only illuminate the\\ncurrent landscape of privacy in DAG-based DLTs but also outline future research\\ndirections in this evolving field.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T17:08:45Z\"}"}
