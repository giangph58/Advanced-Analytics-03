For small to moderately\\nsized systems, we demonstrate a vectorized GPU implementation of a second-order\\nadjoint method that computes both Hessians and gradients with wall times only\\nmarginally more than those required to compute gradients via commonly used\\nfirst-order adjoint methods. Pairing our second-order adjoint method with a\\ntrust region optimizer (a type of Newton method), we show that it outperforms a\\nfirst-order method, requiring significantly fewer iterations and wall time to\\nfind optimal controls for four molecular systems. Our derivation of the\\nsecond-order adjoint method allows for arbitrary parameterizations of the\\ncontrols.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,math.OC,physics.chem-ph,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T13:55:42Z\"}"}
