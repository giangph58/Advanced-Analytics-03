{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15927v1\", \"title\": \"New Recipe for Semi-supervised Community Detection: Clique Annealing\\n  under Crystallization Kinetics\", \"summary\": \"Semi-supervised community detection methods are widely used for identifying\\nspecific communities due to the label scarcity. Existing semi-supervised\\ncommunity detection methods typically involve two learning stages learning in\\nboth initial identification and subsequent adjustment, which often starts from\\nan unreasonable community core candidate. Moreover, these methods encounter\\nscalability issues because they depend on reinforcement learning and generative\\nadversarial networks, leading to higher computational costs and restricting the\\nselection of candidates. To address these limitations, we draw a parallel\\nbetween crystallization kinetics and community detection to integrate the\\nspontaneity of the annealing process into community detection. Specifically, we\\nliken community detection to identifying a crystal subgrain (core) that expands\\ninto a complete grain (community) through a process similar to annealing. Based\\non this finding, we propose CLique ANNealing (CLANN), which applies kinetics\\nconcepts to community detection by integrating these principles into the\\noptimization process to strengthen the consistency of the community core.\\nSubsequently, a learning-free Transitive Annealer was employed to refine the\\nfirst-stage candidates by merging neighboring cliques and repositioning the\\ncommunity core, enabling a spontaneous growth process that enhances\\nscalability. Extensive experiments on \\\\textbf{43} different network settings\\ndemonstrate that CLANN outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple\\nreal-world datasets, showcasing its exceptional efficacy and efficiency in\\ncommunity detection.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SI\", \"categories\": \"cs.SI,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T14:17:15Z\"}"}
