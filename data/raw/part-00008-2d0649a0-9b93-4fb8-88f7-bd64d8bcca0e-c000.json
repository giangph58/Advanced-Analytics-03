{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12008v1\", \"title\": \"Global Patterns of Extreme Temperature Teleconnections Using Climate\\n  Network Analysis\", \"summary\": \"Extreme weather events, rare yet profoundly impactful, are often accompanied\\nby severe conditions. Increasing global temperatures are poised to exacerbate\\nthese events, resulting in greater human casualties, economic losses, and\\necological destruction. Complex global climate interactions, known as\\nteleconnections, can lead to widespread repercussions triggered by localized\\nextreme weather. Understanding these teleconnection patterns is crucial for\\nweather forecasting, enhancing safety, and advancing climate science. Here, we\\nemploy climate network analysis to uncover teleconnection patterns associated\\nwith extreme temperature fluctuations, including both extreme warming and\\ncooling events occurring on a daily basis. Our study results demonstrate that\\nthe distances of significant teleconnections initially conform to a power-law\\ndecay, signifying a decline in connectivity with distance. However, this\\npower-law decay tendency breaks beyond a certain threshold distance, suggesting\\nthe existence of long-distance connections. Additionally, we uncover a greater\\nprevalence of long-distance connectivity among extreme cooling events compared\\nto extreme warming events. The global pattern of teleconnections is, in part,\\ndriven by the mechanism of Rossby waves, which serve as a rapid conduit for\\ninducing correlated fluctuations in both pressure and temperature. These\\nresults enhance our understanding of the multiscale nature of climate\\nteleconnections and hold significant implications for improving weather\\nforecasting and assessing climate risks in a warming world.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T12:05:15Z\"}"}
