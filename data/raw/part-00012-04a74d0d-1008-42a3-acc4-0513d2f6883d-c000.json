In this work, we present a detailed comparison of these\\ntwo approaches using MgO and LiH as prototypical cases employing both empirical\\nrigid ion model (RIM) and machine learning potential (MLP). We demonstrate that\\nthe conventional Lorentz model fails to capture the multi-phonon absorption\\ninherent in Green-Kubo method, which can be resolved via using the phonon\\nself-energy as a generalization of the usual linewidth. In addition, with RIM,\\na correction factor is required in the ionic contribution to infrared response\\nto account for the electronic polarization effect, which is yet captured by MLP\\nusing the Born effective charges for calculating dipole moment. The present\\nbenchmark study thus enables cross-validation of dielectric function\\ncalculations while providing mechanistic insights into the polarization\\ndynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T11:54:12Z\"}"}
