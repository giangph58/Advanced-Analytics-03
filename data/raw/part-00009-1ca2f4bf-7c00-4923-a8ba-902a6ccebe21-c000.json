{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10218v1\", \"title\": \"A Novel Quantum Fourier Ordinary Differential Equation Solver for\\n  Solving Linear and Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations\", \"summary\": \"In this work, a novel quantum Fourier ordinary differential equation (ODE)\\nsolver is proposed to solve both linear and nonlinear partial differential\\nequations (PDEs). Traditional quantum ODE solvers transform a PDE into an ODE\\nsystem via spatial discretization and then integrate it, thereby converting the\\ntask of solving the PDE into computing the integral for the driving function\\n$f(x)$. These solvers rely on the quantum amplitude estimation algorithm, which\\nrequires the driving function $f(x)$ to be within the range of [0, 1] and\\nnecessitates the construction of a quantum circuit for the oracle R that\\nencodes $f(x)$. This construction can be highly complex, even for simple\\nfunctions like $f(x) = x$. An important exception arises for the specific case\\nof $f(x) = sin^2(mx+c)$, which can be encoded more efficiently using a set of\\n$Ry$ rotation gates. To address these challenges, we expand the driving\\nfunction $f(x)$ as a Fourier series and propose the Quantum Fourier ODE Solver.\\nThis approach not only simplifies the construction of the oracle R but also\\nremoves the restriction that $f(x)$ must lie within [0,1]. The proposed method\\nwas evaluated by solving several representative linear and nonlinear PDEs,\\nincluding the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations. The results show that the quantum\\nFourier ODE solver produces results that closely match both analytical and\\nreference solutions.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T13:36:46Z\"}"}
