{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07711v1\", \"title\": \"Merging Embedded Topics with Optimal Transport for Online Topic Modeling\\n  on Data Streams\", \"summary\": \"Topic modeling is a key component in unsupervised learning, employed to\\nidentify topics within a corpus of textual data. The rapid growth of social\\nmedia generates an ever-growing volume of textual data daily, making online\\ntopic modeling methods essential for managing these data streams that\\ncontinuously arrive over time. This paper introduces a novel approach to online\\ntopic modeling named StreamETM. This approach builds on the Embedded Topic\\nModel (ETM) to handle data streams by merging models learned on consecutive\\npartial document batches using unbalanced optimal transport. Additionally, an\\nonline change point detection algorithm is employed to identify shifts in\\ntopics over time, enabling the identification of significant changes in the\\ndynamics of text streams. Numerical experiments on simulated and real-world\\ndata show StreamETM outperforming competitors.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T13:04:56Z\"}"}
