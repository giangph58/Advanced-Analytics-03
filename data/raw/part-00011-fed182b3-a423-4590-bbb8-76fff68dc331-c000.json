In this paper, we consider exceptional actions\\nrelated to the exceptional compact Lie group $G_{2}$ and investigate some\\nproperties of their orbits as Riemannian submanifolds. In particular, we\\nexamine the principal curvatures of principal orbits and classify principal\\norbits that are minimal, austere, weakly reflective, and proper biharmonic.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T05:03:19Z\"}"}
