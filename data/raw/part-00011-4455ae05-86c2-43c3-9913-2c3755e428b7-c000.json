{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13111v1\", \"title\": \"Uncertainty-Aware Trajectory Prediction via Rule-Regularized\\n  Heteroscedastic Deep Classification\", \"summary\": \"Deep learning-based trajectory prediction models have demonstrated promising\\ncapabilities in capturing complex interactions. However, their\\nout-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge,\\nparticularly due to unbalanced data and a lack of enough data and diversity to\\nensure robustness and calibration. To address this, we propose SHIFT (Spectral\\nHeteroscedastic Informed Forecasting for Trajectories), a novel framework that\\nuniquely combines well-calibrated uncertainty modeling with informative priors\\nderived through automated rule extraction. SHIFT reformulates trajectory\\nprediction as a classification task and employs heteroscedastic\\nspectral-normalized Gaussian processes to effectively disentangle epistemic and\\naleatoric uncertainties. We learn informative priors from training labels,\\nwhich are automatically generated from natural language driving rules, such as\\nstop rules and drivability constraints, using a retrieval-augmented generation\\nframework powered by a large language model. Extensive evaluations over the\\nnuScenes dataset, including challenging low-data and cross-location scenarios,\\ndemonstrate that SHIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving\\nsubstantial gains in uncertainty calibration and displacement metrics. In\\nparticular, our model excels in complex scenarios, such as intersections, where\\nuncertainty is inherently higher.
