{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11178v1\", \"title\": \"MeerKAT 1.3 GHz Observations Towards the Milky Way Bulge\", \"summary\": \"We present a MeerKAT survey of portions of the Milky Way bulge. The survey\\ncovers 172.8 square degrees in two contiguous mosaics above and below the\\nGalactic Center as well as 32 single pointing fields at higher longitudes. The\\nresolution of the images is $\\\\sim$8\\\\asec\\\\ at a frequency of 1333 MHz with a\\ntypical Stokes I RMS of 20 $\\\\mu$Jy Beam$^{-1}$. Most of the emission seen is\\nfrom background extragalactic sources but many compact Galactic objects are\\nidentifiable by their polarization properties. Apparent polarized emission\\nresulting from fine scale Faraday rotation in the ISM is widespread in this\\nregion of the Galaxy. The survey is used to search for background Giant Radio\\nGalaxies, $>$700 kpc in size, identifying 17 such objects. Data products\\ninclude FITS images of Stokes I, Q, U and V as well as a Faraday analysis and\\nlists of compact total intensity and polarized sources.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T13:32:45Z\"}"}
