{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05105v1\", \"title\": \"Multigrid methods for the ghost finite element approximation of elliptic\\n  problems\", \"summary\": \"We present multigrid methods for solving elliptic partial differential\\nequations on arbitrary domains using the nodal ghost finite element method, an\\nunfitted boundary approach where the domain is implicitly defined by a\\nlevel-set function. This method achieves second-order accuracy and offers\\nsubstantial computational advantages over both direct solvers and\\nfinite-difference-based multigrid methods. A key strength of the ghost finite\\nelement framework is its variational formulation, which naturally enables\\nconsistent transfer operators and avoids residual splitting across grid levels.\\nWe provide a detailed construction of the multigrid components in both one and\\ntwo spatial dimensions, including smoothers, transfer operators, and coarse\\ngrid operators. The choice of the stabilization parameter plays a crucial role\\nin ensuring well-posedness and optimal convergence of the multigrid method. We\\nderive explicit algebraic expressions for this parameter based on the geometry\\nof cut cells. In the two-dimensional setting, we further improve efficiency by\\nperforming additional smoothing exclusively on cut cells, reducing\\ncomputational cost without compromising convergence. Numerical results validate\\nthe proposed method across a range of geometries and confirm its robustness and\\nscalability.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA,G.1.8\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T10:07:38Z\"}"}
