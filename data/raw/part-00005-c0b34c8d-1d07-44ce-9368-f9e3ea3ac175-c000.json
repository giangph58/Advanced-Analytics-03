Given an abstract symmetric\\nmonoidal category $K$ called Galois prekosmos, we define pre-Galois objects in\\n$K$ and study the categories of their representations internal to $K$. The\\nmotivating example of $K$ is the cartesian monoidal category $\\\\textit{Set}$ of\\nsets, and pre-Galois objects in $\\\\textit{Set}$ are groups. We present an\\naxiomatic definition of pre-Galois $K$-categories, which is a complete abstract\\ncharacterization of the categories of representations of pre-Galois objects in\\n$K$. The category of covering spaces over a well-connected topological space is\\na prototype of a pre-Galois $\\\\textit{Set}$-category. We establish a perfect\\ncorrespondence between pre-Galois objects in $K$ and pre-Galois $K$-categories\\npointed with pre-fiber functors.\\n  We also establish a generalized version of the duality between flat affine\\ngroup schemes and the categories of their linear representations. Given an\\nabstract symmetric monoidal category $K$ called Grothendieck prekosmos, we\\ndefine what are pre-Grothendieck objects in $K$ and study the categories of\\ntheir representations internal to $K$. The motivating example of $K$ is the\\nsymmetric monoidal category $\\\\textit{Vec}_k$ of vector spaces over a field $k$,\\nand pre-Grothendieck objects in $\\\\textit{Vec}_k$ are affine group $k$-schemes.\\nWe present an axiomatic definition of pre-Grothendieck $K$-categories, which is\\na complete abstract characterization of the categories of representations of\\npre-Grothendieck objects in $K$.
