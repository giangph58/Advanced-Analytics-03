However,\\nconventional lithography-based fabrication methods involve complex,\\ntime-consuming, multistep processes, rendering the photonic application of\\n$Sb_{2}S_{3}$ challenging. Here, we demonstrate that positive-tone fabrication\\nof $Sb_{2}S_{3}$ nanostructures using wet-etch femtosecond laser processing, a\\nstraightforward technique for the engraving of micro- and nanoscale structures,\\ncan address major fabrication challenges. The patterning mechanism and factors\\ninfluencing resolution of $Sb_{2}S_{3}$ thin film structures deposited on\\nquartz (transmissive) and gold (reflective) substrates are experimentally\\ninvestigated and supported by theoretical modelling. Using this approach, the\\nsmallest linewidth fabricated is measured at 178 nm. Consequently, multiple\\ntest patterns are demonstrated showing versatile functionalities. Functional\\nFresnel Zone Plates (FZPs) with varying focal length are fabricated and\\ncharacterized. This study provides a significantly simplified approach for\\nrealizing $Sb_{2}S_{3}$ based integrated photonic devices.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.ins-det\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T12:53:43Z\"}"}
