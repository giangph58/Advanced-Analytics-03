{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20792v1\", \"title\": \"RecGaze: The First Eye Tracking and User Interaction Dataset for\\n  Carousel Interfaces\", \"summary\": \"Carousel interfaces are widely used in e-commerce and streaming services, but\\nlittle research has been devoted to them. Previous studies of interfaces for\\npresenting search and recommendation results have focused on single ranked\\nlists, but it appears their results cannot be extrapolated to carousels due to\\nthe added complexity. Eye tracking is a highly informative approach to\\nunderstanding how users click, yet there are no eye tracking studies concerning\\ncarousels. There are very few interaction datasets on recommenders with\\ncarousel interfaces and none that contain gaze data.\\n  We introduce the RecGaze dataset: the first comprehensive feedback dataset on\\ncarousels that includes eye tracking results, clicks, cursor movements, and\\nselection explanations. The dataset comprises of interactions from 3 movie\\nselection tasks with 40 different carousel interfaces per user. In total, 87\\nusers and 3,477 interactions are logged. In addition to the dataset, its\\ndescription and possible use cases, we provide results of a survey on carousel\\ndesign and the first analysis of gaze data on carousels, which reveals a golden\\ntriangle or F-pattern browsing behavior.\\n  Our work seeks to advance the field of carousel interfaces by providing the\\nfirst dataset with eye tracking results on carousels. In this manner, we\\nprovide and encourage an empirical understanding of interactions with carousel\\ninterfaces, for building better recommender systems through gaze information,\\nand also encourage the development of gaze-based recommenders.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:09:20Z\"}"}
