This is presented into two key\\nresults: first, restricting the cluster-DAG to clusters containing at most four\\nnodes; second, adapting the notion of d-separation. We provide a graphical\\ncriterion to address the identifiability problem.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,cs.AI,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:39:43Z\"}"}
