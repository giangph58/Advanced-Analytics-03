{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20503v1\", \"title\": \"Real-time blow-up and connection graphs of rational vector fields on the\\n  Riemann sphere\", \"summary\": \"Inspired by pioneering work of Ky\\\\^uya Masuda in the 1980s, only much more\\nrecent PDE studies address global boundedness versus finite-time blow-up. The\\ntwo phenomena are related by passage from real to purely imaginary time. As a\\nsimple ODE example, we study scalar rational vector fields \\\\begin{equation*}\\n\\\\label{*} \\\\dot{w}=P(w)/Q(w), \\\\tag{*} \\\\end{equation*} for complex polynomials\\n$P,Q$. We impose mild generic nondegeneracy conditions, including simplicity of\\npoles and hyperbolicity of zeros. Generically, the real-time dynamics become\\ngradient-like Morse. Poles play the role of hyperbolic saddle points. Towards\\npoles, however, solutions may blow up in finite time.\\n  On the Riemann sphere $w\\\\in\\\\widehat{\\\\mathbb{C}}$, we classify the resulting\\nglobal dynamics up to $C^0$ orbit equivalence, in real time. This relies on a\\nglobal description of the connection graph of blow-up orbits, from sources\\ntowards saddles/poles, in forward time. Time reversal identifies the dual graph\\nof blow-down orbits. We show that the blow-up and blow-down graphs of (*)\\nrealize all finite multi-graphs on $\\\\mathbb{S}^2$.\\n  The purely polynomial case $Q=1$ realizes all planar trees, alias diagrams of\\nnon-intersecting circle chords. The anti-holomorphic cousin $P=1$ realizes all\\nnoncrossing trees with vertices restricted to circles. This classification\\nidentifies combinatorial counts for the number of global phase portraits, which\\nonly depend on the degrees of $P$ and $Q$, respectively.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T07:45:19Z\"}"}
