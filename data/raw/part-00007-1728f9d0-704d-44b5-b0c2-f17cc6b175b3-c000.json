{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07553v1\", \"title\": \"Single-Cell Trajectory Reconstruction Reveals Migration Potential of\\n  Cell Populations\", \"summary\": \"Cell migration, which is strictly regulated by intracellular and\\nextracellular cues, is crucial for normal physiological processes and the\\nprogression of certain diseases. However, there is a lack of an efficient\\napproach to analyze super-statistical and time-varying characteristics of cell\\nmigration based on single trajectories. Here, we propose an approach to\\nreconstruct single-cell trajectories, which incorporates wavelet transform,\\npower spectrum of an OU-process, and fits of the power spectrum to analyze\\nstatistical and time-varying properties of customized target-finding and\\nmigration metrics. Our results reveal diverse relationships between motility\\nparameters and dynamic metrics, especially the existence of an optimal\\nparameter range. Moreover, the analysis reveals that the loss of Arpin protein\\nenhances the migration potential of D. discoideum, and a previously reported\\nresult that the rescued amoeba is distinguishable from the wild-type amoeba.\\nSignificantly, time-varying dynamic metrics emerge periodic phenomena under the\\ninfluence of irregularly changing parameters, which correlates with migration\\npotential. Our analysis suggests that the approach provides a powerful tool for\\nestimating time-dependent migration potential and statistical features of\\nsingle-cell trajectories, enabling a better understanding of the relationship\\nbetween intracellular proteins and cellular behaviors. This also provides more\\ninsights on the migration dynamics of single cells and cell populations.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.bio-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.bio-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T08:30:07Z\"}"}
