It lies at the heart of\\norganizational principles such as the variational free energy principle and has\\neven been shown -- based on the second law of thermodynamics -- to be necessary\\nfor reaching the fundamental energetic limits of sequential information\\nprocessing. While the usefulness of the predictive paradigm is undisputed,\\ncomplex adaptive systems that interact with their environment are more than\\njust predictive machines: they have the power to act upon their environment and\\ncause change. In this work, we develop a framework to analyze the\\nthermodynamics of information processing in percept-action loops -- a model of\\nagent-environment interaction -- allowing us to investigate the thermodynamic\\nimplications of actions and percepts on equal footing. To this end, we\\nintroduce the concept of work capacity -- the maximum rate at which an agent\\ncan expect to extract work from its environment. Our results reveal that\\nneither of two previously established design principles for work-efficient\\nagents -- maximizing predictive power and forgetting past actions -- remains\\noptimal in environments where actions have observable consequences. Instead, a\\ntrade-off emerges: work-efficient agents must balance prediction and\\nforgetting, as remembering past actions can reduce the available free energy.\\nThis highlights a fundamental departure from the thermodynamics of passive\\nobservation, suggesting that prediction and energy efficiency may be at odds in\\nactive learning systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cond-mat.stat-mech,cs.IT,math.IT,nlin.AO,nlin.CD,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T16:54:20Z\"}"}
