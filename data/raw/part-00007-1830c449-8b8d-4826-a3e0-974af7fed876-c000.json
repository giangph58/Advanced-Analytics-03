(2023), broadening its application from\\nspherical to arbitrarily-shaped particles, while maintaining its capacity to\\naddress both neutrally-buoyant and light objects (down to a density ratio of\\n0.5). The proposed method offers a significant advantage over existing methods\\nregarding its simplicity, in particular for the case of neutrally-buoyant\\nparticles. Three test cases from the literature are selected for validation: a\\nneutrally-buoyant prolate spheroid in a shear flow; a settling oblate spheroid;\\nand, finally, a rising oblate spheroid.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T11:03:04Z\"}"}
