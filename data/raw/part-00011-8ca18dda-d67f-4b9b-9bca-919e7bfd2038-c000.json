By utilizing various lighting conditions for 3D\\nreconstruction, the proposed method surpasses these limitations. By integrating\\nphotometric stereo to the traditional optical microscopy, the proposed method\\nnot only enhances the capability to detect micro-scale defects but also\\nprovides a detailed visualization of depth and edge abnormality, which are\\ntypically not visible with conventional optical microscopy inspection. The\\nexperimental results demonstrated that the proposed method effectively captures\\nintricate surface details and internal structures. Quantitative comparisons\\nbetween the reconstructed models and actual measurements present the capability\\nof the proposed method to significantly improve silicon and glass via\\ninspection process. As a result, the proposed method achieves enhanced\\ncost-effectiveness while maintaining high accuracy and repeatability,\\nsuggesting substantial advancements in silicon and glass via inspection\\ntechniques\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.CV,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T03:09:27Z\"}"}
