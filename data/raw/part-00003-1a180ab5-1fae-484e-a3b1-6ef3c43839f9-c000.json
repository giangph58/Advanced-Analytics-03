Modern trajectory prediction models strive to interpret complex\\npatterns and dependencies from agent and map data. The Motion Transformer (MTR)\\narchitecture and subsequent work define the most accurate methods in common\\nbenchmarks such as the Waymo Open Motion Benchmark. The MTR model employs\\npre-generated static intention points as initial goal points for trajectory\\nprediction. However, the static nature of these points frequently leads to\\nmisalignment with map data in specific traffic scenarios, resulting in\\nunfeasible or unrealistic goal points. Our research addresses this limitation\\nby integrating scene-specific dynamic intention points into the MTR model. This\\nadaptation of the MTR model was trained and evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion\\nDataset. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating dynamic intention points\\nhas a significant positive impact on trajectory prediction accuracy, especially\\nfor predictions over long time horizons. Furthermore, we analyze the impact on\\nground truth trajectories which are not compliant with the map data or are\\nillegal maneuvers.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T10:20:35Z\"}"}
