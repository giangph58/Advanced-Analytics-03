{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10014v1\", \"title\": \"Air Quality Prediction with A Meteorology-Guided Modality-Decoupled\\n  Spatio-Temporal Network\", \"summary\": \"Air quality prediction plays a crucial role in public health and\\nenvironmental protection. Accurate air quality prediction is a complex\\nmultivariate spatiotemporal problem, that involves interactions across temporal\\npatterns, pollutant correlations, spatial station dependencies, and\\nparticularly meteorological influences that govern pollutant dispersion and\\nchemical transformations. Existing works underestimate the critical role of\\natmospheric conditions in air quality prediction and neglect comprehensive\\nmeteorological data utilization, thereby impairing the modeling of dynamic\\ninterdependencies between air quality and meteorological data. To overcome\\nthis, we propose MDSTNet, an encoder-decoder framework that explicitly models\\nair quality observations and atmospheric conditions as distinct modalities,\\nintegrating multi-pressure-level meteorological data and weather forecasts to\\ncapture atmosphere-pollution dependencies for prediction. Meantime, we\\nconstruct ChinaAirNet, the first nationwide dataset combining air quality\\nrecords with multi-pressure-level meteorological observations. Experimental\\nresults on ChinaAirNet demonstrate MDSTNet's superiority, substantially\\nreducing 48-hour prediction errors by 17.54\\\\% compared to the state-of-the-art\\nmodel. The source code and dataset will be available on github.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:18:11Z\"}"}
