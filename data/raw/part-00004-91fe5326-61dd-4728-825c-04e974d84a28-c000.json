{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20549v1\", \"title\": \"Type A algebraic coherence conjecture of Pappas and Rapoport\", \"summary\": \"The Pappas-Rapoport coherence conjecture, proved by Zhu, states that the\\ndimensions of spaces of sections of certain line bundles coincide. The two\\nsides of the equality correspond to the line bundles on spherical Schubert\\nvarieties in the affine Grassmannians and to the line bundles on unions of\\nSchubert varieties in affine flag varieties. Algebraically the claim can be\\nreformulated as an equality between dimensions of certain Demazure modules and\\ncertain sums of Demazure modules. The goal of this paper is to formulate an\\nalgebraic construction providing an explicit link between the above mentioned\\nDemazure modules. Our construction works only in type A, but it is applicable\\nto a much wider class of representations than whose popping up in the geometric\\ncoherence conjecture. In the general case one side of conjectural equality\\ninvolves the affine Kostant-Kumar modules.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RT\", \"categories\": \"math.RT,math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T08:52:10Z\"}"}
