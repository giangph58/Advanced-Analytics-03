{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06028v1\", \"title\": \"A Mean-Reverting Model of Exchange Rate Risk Premium Using\\n  Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Dynamics\", \"summary\": \"This paper examines the empirical failure of uncovered interest parity (UIP)\\nand proposes a structural explanation based on a mean-reverting risk premium.\\nWe define a realized premium as the deviation between observed exchange rate\\nreturns and the interest rate differential, and demonstrate its strong\\nmean-reverting behavior across multiple horizons. Motivated by this pattern, we\\nmodel the risk premium using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process embedded within\\na stochastic differential equation for the exchange rate.\\n  Our model yields closed-form approximations for future exchange rate\\ndistributions, which we evaluate using coverage-based backtesting. Applied to\\nUSD/KRW data from 2010 to 2025, the model shows strong predictive performance\\nat both short-term and long-term horizons, while underperforming at\\nintermediate (3-month) horizons and showing conservative behavior in the tails\\nof long-term forecasts. These results suggest that exchange rate deviations\\nfrom UIP may reflect structured, forecastable dynamics rather than pure noise,\\nand point to future modeling improvements via regime-switching or time-varying\\nvolatility.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.CP\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.CP,q-fin.ST\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:33:15Z\"}"}
