In the\\nabsence of control, it is well-known that free solutions starting from initial\\ndata sufficiently large can blow-up. More precisely, given a finite number of\\npoints, there exists particular profiles blowing up exactly at these points at\\nthe blow-up time. For pertubations of these profiles, we show that, with the\\nhelp of an appropriate nonlinear feedback law located in an open set containing\\nthe blow-up points, the blow-up can be prevented from happening. More\\nspecifically, we construct a small-time control acting just before the blow-up\\ntime. The solution may then be extended globally in time. This is the first\\nresult of control for blow-up profiles for nonlinear Schr\\\\\\\"odinger type\\nequations. Assuming further a geometrical control condition on the support of\\nthe control, we are able to prove a null-controllability result for such\\nblow-up profiles. Finally, we discuss possible extensions to three-dimensional\\ndomains.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T12:46:00Z\"}"}
