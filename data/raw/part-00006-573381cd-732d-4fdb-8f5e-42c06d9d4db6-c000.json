{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02663v1\", \"title\": \"Development of Automated Data Quality Assessment and Evaluation Indices\\n  by Analytical Experience\", \"summary\": \"The societal need to leverage third-party data has driven the\\ndata-distribution market and increased the importance of data quality\\nassessment (DQA) in data transactions between organizations. However, DQA\\nrequires expert knowledge of raw data and related data attributes, which\\nhinders consensus-building in data purchasing. This study focused on the\\ndifferences in DQAs between experienced and inexperienced data handlers. We\\nperformed two experiments: The first was a questionnaire survey involving 41\\nparticipants with varying levels of data-handling experience, who evaluated 12\\ndata samples using 10 predefined indices with and without quality metadata\\ngenerated by the automated tool. The second was an eye-tracking experiment to\\nreveal the viewing behavior of participants during data evaluation. It was\\nrevealed that using quality metadata generated by the automated tool can reduce\\nmisrecognition in DQA. While experienced data handlers rated the quality\\nmetadata highly, semi-experienced users gave it the lowest ratings. This study\\ncontributes to enhancing data understanding within organizations and promoting\\nthe distribution of valuable data by proposing an automated tool to support\\nDQAs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:03:08Z\"}"}
