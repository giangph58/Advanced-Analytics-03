We establish a close relationship\\nbetween the (strong) generation of the singularity category of R, the\\nnonvanishing of the annihilator of the singularity category of R, and the\\nnonvanishing of the cohomological annihilator of modules. As an application, we\\nprove that the singularity category of R has a strong generator if and only if\\nthe annihilator of the singularity category of R is nonzero when R is a\\nNoetherian domain with Krull dimension at most one. Furthermore, we relate the\\ngeneration of the singularity category and the extension generation of the\\nmodule category. Additionally, we introduce the notion of the co-cohomological\\nannihilator of modules. If the category of finitely generated R-modules has a\\nstrong generator, we show that the infinite injective dimension locus of a\\nfinitely generated R-module M is closed, with the defining ideal given by the\\nco-cohomological annihilator of M.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AC\", \"categories\": \"math.AC,math.RT\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:03:30Z\"}"}
