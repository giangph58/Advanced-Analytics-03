Moreover, the minimal assumption for computational\\nquantum cryptography remains an open question. Recently, it has been shown that\\npseudoentanglement is necessary for the existence of quantum cryptography\\n(Goul\\\\~ao and Elkouss 2024), but no cryptographic construction has been built\\nfrom it.\\n  In this work, we study the cryptographic usefulness of quantum\\npseudoresources -- a pair of families of quantum states that exhibit a gap in\\ntheir resource content yet remain computationally indistinguishable. We show\\nthat quantum pseudoresources imply a variant of EFI pairs, which we call EPFI\\npairs, and that these are equivalent to quantum commitments and thus EFI pairs.\\nOur results suggest that, just as randomness is fundamental to classical\\ncryptography, quantum resources may play a similarly crucial role in the\\nquantum setting.\\n  Finally, we focus on the specific case of entanglement, analyzing different\\ndefinitions of pseudoentanglement and their implications for constructing EPFI\\npairs. Moreover, we propose a new cryptographic functionality that is\\nintrinsically dependent on entanglement as a resource.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T11:17:30Z\"}"}
