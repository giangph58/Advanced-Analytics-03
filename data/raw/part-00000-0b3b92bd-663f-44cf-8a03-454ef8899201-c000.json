In a cubic antiperovskite these\\nsites form Kagome planes stacked along the <111> directions which triangular\\nmotifs induce high geometric frustration in the diluted magnetic sublattice for\\nantiferromagnetic interactions. Despite their compelling properties as\\nhigh-capacity Li-ion battery cathode materials, very little is known about the\\nelectronic and magnetic properties of lithium-rich antiperovskites. We report\\nstatic magnetization, M\\\\\\\"ossbauer, and NMR studies on both compounds. Our data\\nreveal a Pauli paramagnetic-like behaviour, a long-range antiferromagnetically\\nordered ground state below 50 K and a regime of short-range magnetic\\ncorrelations up to 100 K. Our results are consistent with a random Li-Fe\\ndistribution on the shared lattice position. In addition, Li-hopping is\\nobserved above 200 K with an activation energy of E$_a$ = 0.47 eV. Overall, our\\ndata elucidate static magnetism in a disordered magnetically frustrated and\\npresumably semimetallic system with thermally induced ion diffusion dynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T09:05:46Z\"}"}
