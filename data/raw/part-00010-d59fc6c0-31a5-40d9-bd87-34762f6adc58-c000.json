Motivated by the ability of circularly\\npolarized light to induce nontrivial topological states at Dirac nodes, we\\ninvestigate the emergence of a photoinduced DC Hall effect in the Dirac\\nsemimetal phase of fBP. Starting from a low-energy continuum model, we derive\\nthe effective Floquet Hamiltonian and analytically calculate the Berry\\ncurvature, demonstrating the opening of a topological gap. We also perform\\nlattice-model calculations incorporating a self-consistent Hartree method to\\ncompute Floquet band structures and DC Hall conductivity under a perpendicular\\nelectric field. Our results reveal that the DC Hall current in fBP can be\\neffectively tuned via a periodic driving field and electrostatic gating.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T08:16:41Z\"}"}
