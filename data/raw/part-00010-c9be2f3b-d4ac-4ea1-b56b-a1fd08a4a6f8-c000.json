In general, the total variation of\\nthese solutions decays like $t^{-1}$. Motivated by the theory of fractional\\ndomains for linear analytic semigroups, we consider here solutions with faster\\ndecay rate: $\\\\hbox{Tot.Var.}\\\\bigl\\\\{u(t,\\\\cdot)\\\\bigr\\\\}\\\\leq C t^{\\\\alpha-1}$. For\\nthese solutions, a uniqueness theorem is proved. Indeed, as the initial data\\nrange over a domain of functions with $\\\\|\\\\bar u\\\\|_{{\\\\bf L}^\\\\infty}\\n\\\\leq\\\\varepsilon_1$ small enough, solutions with fast decay yield a H\\\\\\\"older\\ncontinuous semigroup. The H\\\\\\\"older exponent can be taken arbitrarily close to\\n$1$ by further shrinking the value of $\\\\varepsilon_1>0$. An auxiliary result\\nidentifies a class of initial data whose solutions have rapidly decaying total\\nvariation.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T09:35:54Z\"}"}
