Using the\\n3D dynamics of gas and interstellar polydisperse dust grains we analyze the\\nevolution of SNR in the inhomogeneous medium. We obtain spatial distributions\\nof the surface brigthness both of the X-ray emission from hot gas inside SNR\\nand the IR emission from the SNR swept-up shell, as well as, the average gas\\ntemperature in the SNR, $T_X$. We find that the IRX changes significantly (by a\\nfactor of $\\\\sim 3-30$) as a function of impact distance within the SNR and its\\nage. In a low inhomogeneous medium the IRX drops rapidly during the SNR\\nevolution. On the other hand, if large inhomogeneities are present in the\\nmedium, the IRX is maintained at higher levels during the late SNR evolution at\\nradiative phase due to replenishment of dust in the hot gas by incompletely\\ndestroyed fragments behind the shock front. We show that the onset of the\\nradiative phase determines the evolution of the $T_X - {\\\\rm IRX}$ diagram. We\\nillustrate that decreasing gas metallicity or density leads to high values of\\ntemperature and IRX ratio. We discuss how our results can be applied to the\\nobservational data to analyse the SNR older than 10 kyr (i.e. when the mass of\\nthe swept-up dust in the shell is expected to exceed that produced in the SNR)\\nin the Galaxy and Large Magellanic Cloud.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T14:31:05Z\"}"}
