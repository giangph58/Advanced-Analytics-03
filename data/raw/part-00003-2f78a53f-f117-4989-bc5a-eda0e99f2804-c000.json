{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01745v1\", \"title\": \"Characterising galaxy cluster scaling relations as cosmic isotropy\\n  tracers using the FLAMINGO simulations\", \"summary\": \"The standard cosmological model, $\\\\Lambda$CDM, assumes isotropy on large\\ncosmic scales. However, recent studies using galaxy cluster scaling relations\\nreported an apparent $H_0$ anisotropy at $5.4\\\\sigma$ that could be attributed\\nto large bulk flows extending beyond $500\\\\,\\\\mathrm{Mpc}$, in disagreement with\\n$\\\\Lambda$CDM. To quantify the statistical tension of the observational galaxy\\ncluster data used in past studies with $\\\\Lambda$CDM, we utilise the isotropic\\n($2.8\\\\,\\\\mathrm{Gpc})^3$ run of the FLAMINGO ($\\\\Lambda$CDM) simulations, the\\nlargest hydrodynamical cosmological simulation available to date. We create\\n1728 simulated lightcones and study the apparent level of anisotropy traced by\\nX-ray and thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich scaling relations in the same cluster\\nsample selection and methodology as in Migkas et al. (2021, arXiv:2103.13904).\\nWe find the probability of such apparent anisotropies randomly emerging in\\ncluster scaling relations within a $\\\\Lambda$CDM universe to be $0.12\\\\%\\\\,\\n(3.2\\\\sigma)$. The discrepancy goes up to $\\\\sim 3.6\\\\sigma$ when modelled as a\\nbulk flow at $z < 0.1$. We find that statistical noise accounts for over $80\\\\%$\\nof the anisotropy amplitude in each lightcone, with large peculiar velocities\\ncontributing less than $20\\\\%$. We also show that anisotropy amplitudes are\\nhighly sensitive to the intrinsic scatter in the scaling relations, with\\ntighter relations providing stronger constraints. Nevertheless, the tension\\nbetween Migkas et al. (2021, arXiv:2103.13904) and $\\\\Lambda$CDM persists,\\nhowever, at a lower significance than previously reported.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T13:55:14Z\"}"}
