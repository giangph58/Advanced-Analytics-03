We assume that the projection of $\\\\Gamma$ onto $\\\\text{Sim}\\n(\\\\mathbb R^q)$ contains a non-isometric similarity. This construction, when $N$\\nis a symmetric space of non-compact type, is a generalization of the well-known\\nInoue surfaces. We prove that this situation is in fact equivalent to that of\\nso-called LCP manifolds. We show a Bieberbach rigidity result in the case of\\nsymmetric spaces, providing a way to construct admissible groups $\\\\Gamma$. We\\nalso consider the projection of $\\\\Gamma$ onto $\\\\text{Isom}(N)$ in the case\\nwhere $N$ has negative curvature, leading to some classification results.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T10:11:57Z\"}"}
