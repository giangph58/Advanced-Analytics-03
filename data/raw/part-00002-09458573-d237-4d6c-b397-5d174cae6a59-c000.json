To our knowledge, our proof is the first for this protocol that is both\\ngeneral (in that it can handle arbitrary, asymmetric channels), and also the\\nfirst that derives a bound on the quantum min entropy for general attacks,\\nwithout relying on post selection techniques or the asymptotic equipartition\\nproperty. Because of this, our new result shows that far more optimistic\\nkey-rates are possible for a low number of signals, even in general channels.\\nFurthermore, our proof methods may be broadly applicable to other protocols\\nrelying on multiple measurement bases and we prove several technical lemmas\\nthat may have independent interest. We evaluate our new bound and compare to\\nprior work, showing that higher key-rates are possible in several operating\\nscenarios. We also show some interesting behavior of the protocol when faced\\nwith asymmetric noise.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:55:24Z\"}"}
