However, recent Transformer and CNN based methods often struggle\\nwith variations in morphology and staining, which limits their feature\\nextraction capabilities. In medical image segmentation, where data samples are\\noften limited, state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods improve accuracy by using\\npre-trained encoders, while end-to-end approaches typically fall short due to\\ndifficulties in transferring multiscale features effectively between encoders\\nand decoders. To handle these challenges, we introduce a nested UNet\\narchitecture that captures both local and global context through Multiscale\\nFeature Fusion and Attention Mechanisms. This design improves feature\\nintegration from encoders, highlights key channels and regions, and restores\\nspatial details to enhance segmentation performance. Our method surpasses SOTA\\napproaches, as evidenced by experiments across four datasets and detailed\\nablation studies.
