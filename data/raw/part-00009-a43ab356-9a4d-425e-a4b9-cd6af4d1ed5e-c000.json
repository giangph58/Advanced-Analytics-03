Motivated by neuromorphic engineering applications,\\nin this note we extend a recently introduced nonlinear network graphical\\nmodeling framework to include negative conductance elements. We use this\\nextended framework to define the class of singular networks and to characterize\\ntheir ultra-sensitive input/output behaviors at given terminals. Our results\\nare grounded in the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction method, which is shown to fully\\ncharacterize the singularities and bifurcations of the input-output behavior at\\nthe network terminals, including when the underlying input-output relation is\\nnot explicitly computable through other reduction methods.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T10:24:25Z\"}"}
