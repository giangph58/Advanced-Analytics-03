We then apply the model to\\nmeasurements of the emitting height and disk temperature conducted as part of\\nexoALMA, integrated with additional legacy measurements from the MAPS Large\\nProgramme, to derive CO column densities and surface density profiles (assuming\\na CO abundance) for a total of 14 disks. A unique feature of the method we\\nintroduce to measure surface densities is that it can be applied to optically\\nthick observations, rather than optically thin as conventionally done. While we\\nuse our method on a sample of well studied disks where temperature structures\\nhave been derived using two emission lines, we show that reasonably accurate\\nestimates can be obtained also when only one molecular transition is available.\\nWith our method we obtain independent constraints from $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO\\nand we find they are in general good agreement using the standard\\n$^{12}$C/$^{13}$C isotopic ratio. The masses derived from our method are\\nsystematically lower compared with the values derived dynamically from the\\nrotation curve if using an ISM CO abundance, implying that CO is depleted by a\\nmedian factor $\\\\sim$20 with respect to the ISM value, in line with other works\\nthat find that CO is depleted in proto-planetary disks.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:31:51Z\"}"}
