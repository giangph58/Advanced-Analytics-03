{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13026v1\", \"title\": \"TTRD3: Texture Transfer Residual Denoising Dual Diffusion Model for\\n  Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution\", \"summary\": \"Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution (RSISR) reconstructs high-resolution\\n(HR) remote sensing images from low-resolution inputs to support fine-grained\\nground object interpretation. Existing methods face three key challenges: (1)\\nDifficulty in extracting multi-scale features from spatially heterogeneous RS\\nscenes, (2) Limited prior information causing semantic inconsistency in\\nreconstructions, and (3) Trade-off imbalance between geometric accuracy and\\nvisual quality. To address these issues, we propose the Texture Transfer\\nResidual Denoising Dual Diffusion Model (TTRD3) with three innovations: First,\\na Multi-scale Feature Aggregation Block (MFAB) employing parallel heterogeneous\\nconvolutional kernels for multi-scale feature extraction. Second, a Sparse\\nTexture Transfer Guidance (STTG) module that transfers HR texture priors from\\nreference images of similar scenes. Third, a Residual Denoising Dual Diffusion\\nModel (RDDM) framework combining residual diffusion for deterministic\\nreconstruction and noise diffusion for diverse generation. Experiments on\\nmulti-source RS datasets demonstrate TTRD3's superiority over state-of-the-art\\nmethods, achieving 1.43% LPIPS improvement and 3.67% FID enhancement compared\\nto best-performing baselines.
