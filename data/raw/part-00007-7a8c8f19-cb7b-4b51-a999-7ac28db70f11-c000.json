{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12896v1\", \"title\": \"Performance guarantees of light-cone variational quantum algorithms for\\n  the maximum cut problem\", \"summary\": \"Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are promising to demonstrate the\\nadvantage of near-term quantum computing over classical computing in practical\\napplications, such as the maximum cut (MaxCut) problem. However, current VQAs\\nsuch as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) have lower\\nperformance guarantees compared to the best-known classical algorithm, and\\nsuffer from hard optimization processes due to the barren plateau problem. We\\npropose a light-cone VQA by choosing an optimal gate sequence of the standard\\nVQAs, which enables a significant improvement in solution accuracy while\\navoiding the barren plateau problem. Specifically, we prove that the light-cone\\nVQA with one round achieves an approximation ratio of 0.7926 for the MaxCut\\nproblem in the worst case of $3$-regular graphs, which is higher than that of\\nthe 3-round QAOA, and can be further improved to 0.8333 by an angle-relaxation\\nprocedure. Finally, these performance guarantees are verified by numerical\\nsimulations and hardware demonstrations on IBM quantum devices. In a 72-qubit\\ndemonstration, the single-round light-cone VQA achieves the exact MaxCut\\nsolution whereas the $p$-round QAOA with $p=1,2,3$ only obtains approximate\\nsolutions. Furthermore, the single-round light-cone VQA derives solutions\\nsurpassing the hardness threshold in a 148-qubit demonstration while QAOA with\\n$p=1,2,3$ does not. Our work highlights a promising route towards solving\\npractical and classically hard problems on near-term quantum devices.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T12:38:16Z\"}"}
