An\\noptimized method for extracting the cosmic baryon density from localized FRBs,\\nbased on maximizing the joint likelihood function of the extragalactic\\ndispersion measure ($\\\\mathrm{DM}_{\\\\mathrm{ext}}$), was proposed by Macquart et\\nal. [Nature 581, 391 (2020)]. In this Letter, we identify a crucial term that\\nwas omitted in their derivation of the probability density function (PDF) for\\n$\\\\mathrm{DM}_{\\\\mathrm{ext}}$. Using simulated FRB data, we demonstrate that\\nneglecting this term leads to a systematic bias in the inferred cosmic baryon\\ndensity, with deviations exceeding the $1\\\\sigma$ confidence level. This\\nhighlights the importance of the missing term for the reliable cosmological\\napplication of FRBs. Furthermore, employing a sample of 88 real localized FRBs,\\nwe find that the baryon density derived using the original PDF by Macquart et\\nal. is inconsistent with the Planck 2018 CMB data, while our corrected PDF\\nyields a result in excellent agreement. We conclude that the omitted term is\\nessential and must be included in order to obtain accurate cosmological\\nconstraints from FRB observations.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:02:33Z\"}"}
