{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20749v1\", \"title\": \"Spectral Analysis of the Orbital Dynamics of Globular Clusters in the\\n  Central Region of the Milky Way\", \"summary\": \"A new method for determining the nature of the orbital motion (chaotic or\\nregular) of globular clusters in the central region of the Galaxy with a radius\\nof 3.5 kpc, which are most affected by the bar, is proposed. The method is\\nbased on calculating the orbital power spectrum as a function of time and\\ncalculating the entropy of the power spectrum as a measure of orbital chaos.\\nThe sample includes 45 globular clusters. To form the 6D phase space required\\nfor integrating the orbits, the most accurate astrometric data to date from the\\nGaia satellite (Vasiliev \\\\& Baumgardt, 2021) were used, as well as new refined\\naverage distances (Baumgardt \\\\& Vasiliev, 2021). Orbits of globular clusters\\nare obtained in a non-axisymmetric potential with a bar in the form of a\\ntriaxial ellipsoid embedded in an axisymmetric potential, traditionally used by\\nus to construct orbits of globular clusters, described in detail in the paper\\nby Bajkova et al. (2023a). The following, most realistic, bar parameters are\\nadopted: mass $10^{10} M_\\\\odot$, length of the major semi-axis 5 kpc, angle of\\nrotation of the bar axis 25$^o$, angular velocity of rotation 40 km s$^{-1}$\\nkpc$^{-1}$. A list of 23 globular clusters with regular dynamics and 22\\nglobular clusters with chaotic dynamics is determined. The correlation of the\\nobtained classification of globular clusters with the classification obtained\\nby us using other methods in the work of Bajkova et al. (2024a) was determined.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:31:55Z\"}"}
