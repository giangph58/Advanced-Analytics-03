A validated numerical model is used\\nto study the impact of particle seeding fluctuations on flame stability.\\nSimulations are conducted for the Bunsen setup in the right-side up and up-side\\ndown configuration. No significant differences in flame response are identified\\nin flame stability between the right-side up and up-side down configurations.\\nWe find that the Bunsen flame is surprisingly robust to abrupt changes in\\nparticle loading. The sudden change in particle loading does not excite any\\nintrinsic instabilities in the flame. Based on our results, the iron dust\\nflames are robust to imposed fluctuations. We hypothesize that this is due to\\nthe lack of a feedback mechanism between the burned temperature and the heat\\nrelease rate. This mechanism is present in conventional, chemistry-driven,\\ngaseous flames. However, such a mechanism is absent in iron dust flames because\\nthe combustion of individual iron particles is limited by oxygen diffusion,\\nwhich is insensitive to temperature.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T16:22:50Z\"}"}
