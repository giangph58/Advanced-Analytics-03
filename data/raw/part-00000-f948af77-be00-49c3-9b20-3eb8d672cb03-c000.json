{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16880v1\", \"title\": \"Quantum circuits for simulating linear interferometers\", \"summary\": \"Motivated by recent proposals for quantum proof of work protocols, we\\ninvestigate approaches for simulating linear optical interferometers using\\ndigital quantum circuits. We focus on a second quantisation approach, where the\\nquantum computer's registers represent optical modes. We can then use standard\\nquantum optical techniques to decompose the unitary matrix describing an\\ninterferometer into an array of $2\\\\times 2$ unitaries, which are subsequently\\nsynthesised into quantum circuits and stitched together to complete the\\ncircuit. For an $m$ mode interferometer with $n$ identical photons, this method\\nrequires approximately $\\\\mathcal{O}(m \\\\log(n))$ qubits and a circuit depth of\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}(m n^4 \\\\log_2(n) \\\\: \\\\textrm{polylog}(n^4 / \\\\epsilon))$. We present\\na software package Aquinas (A QUantum INterferometer ASsembler) that uses this\\napproach to generate such quantum circuits. For reference, an arbitrary five\\nmode interferometer with two identical photons is compiled to a 10 qubit\\nquantum circuit with a depth of 1972.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T16:56:48Z\"}"}
