Recent\\nexperiments have utilized the total angular momentum (TAM) of a photon as a\\nunique means to produce entangled qubits in nanophotonic platforms. Yet, the\\nprocess of transferring the information between the free-space DoFs and the TAM\\nwas never investigated, and its implications are still unknown. Here, we reveal\\nthe evolution of quantum information in heralded single photons as they couple\\ninto and out of the near-field of a nanophotonic system. Through quantum state\\ntomography, we discover that the TAM qubit in the near-field becomes a\\nfree-space qudit entangled in the photonic SAM and OAM. The extracted density\\nmatrix and Wigner function in free-space indicate state preparation fidelity\\nabove 97%. The concepts described here bring new concepts and methodologies in\\ndeveloping high-dimensional quantum circuitry on a chip.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T09:42:01Z\"}"}
