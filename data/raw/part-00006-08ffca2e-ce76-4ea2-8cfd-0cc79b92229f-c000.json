A retrodiction makes a claim about its past given knowledge of its\\nfuture. We introduce the ambidextrous hidden Markov chain that does both\\noptimally -- the bidirectional machine whose state structure makes explicit all\\nstatistical correlations in a stochastic process. We introduce an informational\\ntaxonomy to profile these correlations via a suite of multivariate information\\nmeasures. While prior results laid out the different kinds of information\\ncontained in isolated measurements, in addition to being limited to single\\nmeasurements the associated informations were challenging to calculate\\nexplicitly. Overcoming these via bidirectional machine states, we expand that\\nanalysis to information embedded across sequential measurements. The result\\nhighlights fourteen new interpretable and calculable information measures that\\nfully characterize a process' informational structure. Additionally, we\\nintroduce a labeling and indexing scheme that systematizes\\ninformation-theoretic analyses of highly complex multivariate systems.\\nOperationalizing this, we provide algorithms to directly calculate all of these\\nquantities in closed form for finitely-modeled processes.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech,cs.IT,math.IT,nlin.AO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:36:20Z\"}"}
