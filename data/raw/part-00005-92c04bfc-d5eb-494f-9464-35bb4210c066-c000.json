Fukaya and T. Matsuka. In this paper, we\\nstudy coarse geometric permanence properties of the free product $X \\\\ast Y$. We\\nshow that if $X$ and $Y$ satisfy any of the following conditions, then $X \\\\ast\\nY$ also satisfies that condition: (1) they are coarsely embeddable into a\\nHilbert space or a uniformly convex Banach space; (2) they have Yu's Property\\nA; (3) they are hyperbolic spaces. These generalize the corresponding results\\nfor discrete groups to the case of metric spaces.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA,math.MG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T04:26:05Z\"}"}
