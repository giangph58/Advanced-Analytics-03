{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15185v1\", \"title\": \"ForgeBench: A Machine Learning Benchmark Suite and Auto-Generation\\n  Framework for Next-Generation HLS Tools\", \"summary\": \"Although High-Level Synthesis (HLS) has attracted considerable interest in\\nhardware design, it has not yet become mainstream due to two primary\\nchallenges. First, current HLS hardware design benchmarks are outdated as they\\ndo not cover modern machine learning (ML) applications, preventing the rigorous\\ndevelopment of HLS tools on ML-focused hardware design. Second, existing HLS\\ntools are outdated because they predominantly target individual accelerator\\ndesigns and lack an architecture-oriented perspective to support common\\nhardware module extraction and reuse, limiting their adaptability and broader\\napplicability. Motivated by these two limitations, we propose ForgeBench, an\\nML-focused benchmark suite with a hardware design auto-generation framework for\\nnext-generation HLS tools. In addition to the auto-generation framework, we\\nprovide two ready-to-use benchmark suites. The first contains over 6,000\\nrepresentative ML HLS designs. We envision future HLS tools being\\narchitecture-oriented, capable of automatically identifying common\\ncomputational modules across designs, and supporting flexible dataflow and\\ncontrol. Accordingly, the second benchmark suite includes ML HLS designs with\\npossible resource sharing manually implemented to highlight the necessity of\\narchitecture-oriented design, ensuring it is future-HLS ready. ForgeBench is\\nopen-sourced at https://github.com/hchen799/ForgeBench .\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AR\", \"categories\": \"cs.AR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T15:49:27Z\"}"}
