{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17306v1\", \"title\": \"Advanced Segmentation of Diabetic Retinopathy Lesions Using DeepLabv3+\", \"summary\": \"To improve the segmentation of diabetic retinopathy lesions (microaneurysms,\\nhemorrhages, exudates, and soft exudates), we implemented a binary segmentation\\nmethod specific to each type of lesion. As post-segmentation, we combined the\\nindividual model outputs into a single image to better analyze the lesion\\ntypes. This approach facilitated parameter optimization and improved accuracy,\\neffectively overcoming challenges related to dataset limitations and annotation\\ncomplexity. Specific preprocessing steps included cropping and applying\\ncontrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization to the L channel of the LAB\\nimage. Additionally, we employed targeted data augmentation techniques to\\nfurther refine the model's efficacy. Our methodology utilized the DeepLabv3+\\nmodel, achieving a segmentation accuracy of 99%. These findings highlight the\\nefficacy of innovative strategies in advancing medical image analysis,\\nparticularly in the precise segmentation of diabetic retinopathy lesions. The\\nIDRID dataset was utilized to validate and demonstrate the robustness of our\\napproach.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T07:00:38Z\"}"}
