{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01566v1\", \"title\": \"GPT Adoption and the Impact of Disclosure Policies\", \"summary\": \"Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs), particularly Large Language\\nModels (LLMs) like ChatGPT, have proven effective in content generation and\\nproductivity enhancement. However, legal risks associated with these tools lead\\nto adoption variance and concealment of AI use within organizations. This study\\nexamines the impact of disclosure on ChatGPT adoption in legal, audit and\\nadvisory roles in consulting firms through the lens of agency theory. We\\nconducted a survey experiment to evaluate agency costs in the context of\\nunregulated corporate use of ChatGPT, with a particular focus on how mandatory\\ndisclosure influences information asymmetry and misaligned interests. Our\\nfindings indicate that in the absence of corporate regulations, such as an AI\\npolicy, firms may incur agency costs, which can hinder the full benefits of GPT\\nadoption. While disclosure policies reduce information asymmetry, they do not\\nsignificantly lower overall agency costs due to managers undervaluing analysts'\\ncontributions with GPT use. Finally, we examine the scope of existing\\nregulations in Europe and the United States regarding disclosure requirements,\\nexplore the sharing of risk and responsibility within firms, and analyze how\\nincentive mechanisms promote responsible AI adoption.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T10:09:54Z\"}"}
