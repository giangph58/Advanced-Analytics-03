However, existing\\nCC paradigms have a primary limitation in that they require deep expertise for\\nselecting or designing effective variable decomposition strategies. Inspired by\\nadvancements in Meta-Black-Box Optimization, this paper introduces LCC, a\\npioneering learning-based cooperative coevolution framework that dynamically\\nschedules decomposition strategies during optimization processes. The\\ndecomposition strategy selector is parameterized through a neural network,\\nwhich processes a meticulously crafted set of optimization status features to\\ndetermine the optimal strategy for each optimization step. The network is\\ntrained via the Proximal Policy Optimization method in a reinforcement learning\\nmanner across a collection of representative problems, aiming to maximize the\\nexpected optimization performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate\\nthat LCC not only offers certain advantages over state-of-the-art baselines in\\nterms of optimization effectiveness and resource consumption, but it also\\nexhibits promising transferability towards unseen problems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.NE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:09:22Z\"}"}
