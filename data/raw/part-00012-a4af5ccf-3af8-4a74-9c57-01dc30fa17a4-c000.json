{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10397v1\", \"title\": \"Can LLMs Assist Expert Elicitation for Probabilistic Causal Modeling?\", \"summary\": \"Objective: This study investigates the potential of Large Language Models\\n(LLMs) as an alternative to human expert elicitation for extracting structured\\ncausal knowledge and facilitating causal modeling in biometric and healthcare\\napplications.\\n  Material and Methods: LLM-generated causal structures, specifically Bayesian\\nnetworks (BNs), were benchmarked against traditional statistical methods (e.g.,\\nBayesian Information Criterion) using healthcare datasets. Validation\\ntechniques included structural equation modeling (SEM) to verifying\\nrelationships, and measures such as entropy, predictive accuracy, and\\nrobustness to compare network structures.\\n  Results and Discussion: LLM-generated BNs demonstrated lower entropy than\\nexpert-elicited and statistically generated BNs, suggesting higher confidence\\nand precision in predictions. However, limitations such as contextual\\nconstraints, hallucinated dependencies, and potential biases inherited from\\ntraining data require further investigation.\\n  Conclusion: LLMs represent a novel frontier in expert elicitation for\\nprobabilistic causal modeling, promising to improve transparency and reduce\\nuncertainty in the decision-making using such models.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:45:52Z\"}"}
