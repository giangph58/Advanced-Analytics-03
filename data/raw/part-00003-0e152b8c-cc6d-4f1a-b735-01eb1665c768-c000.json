In this work, we extend our\\ninvestigation to the $\\\\gamma^{(*)} + N(940)\\\\frac{1}{2}^+ \\\\to\\nN(1520)\\\\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ transition. Our computed transition form factors show\\nreasonable agreement with experimental data at large photon virtualities.\\nHowever, deviations emerge at low $Q^2$, where experimental results exhibit a\\nsharper variation than theoretical predictions. This discrepancy is expected,\\nas these continuum QCD analyses account only for the quark-core of baryons,\\nwhile low photon virtualities are dominated by meson cloud effects. We\\nanticipate that these analytical predictions, based on the simplified SCI\\nframework, will serve as a valuable benchmark for more refined studies and\\nQCD-based truncations that incorporate quark angular momentum and the\\ncontributions of scalar and vector diquarks.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex,hep-lat,hep-th,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T14:28:48Z\"}"}
