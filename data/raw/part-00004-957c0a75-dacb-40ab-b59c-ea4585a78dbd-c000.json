We start by recomputing a canonical form for\\nthe sunrise integral with all unequal masses. Additionally, we compute for the\\nfirst time a canonical form for the three-loop banana integral with two unequal\\nmasses and for a four-loop banana integral with two unequal masses. For the\\nintegrals we compute, we find an $\\\\epsilon$-form whose connection has at most\\nsimple poles. We motivate our construction by studying the Picard-Fuchs\\noperators acting on the integrals considered. In the appendices, we give a\\nconstructive explanation for why our generalisation works.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T17:20:12Z\"}"}
