Differential Equations, 338:572-590,\\n2022] proved the existence of periodic steady water waves over an infinitely\\ndeep, two-dimensional and constant vorticity flow under the influence of\\ngravity. These solutions include overhanging wave profiles, some of which\\nexhibit surfaces that touch at a point and thereby enclose a bubble of air. We\\nextend these results by formulating a problem that encompasses both infinitely\\ndeep and finitely deep flows, and by proving the existence of a continuous\\ncurve of water waves that connects a laminar flow to a touching wave for fixed,\\nnonzero gravity. This implies the existence of a wave profile featuring a\\nvertical tangent at a point, which is not overhanging, and is referred to as a\\nbreaking wave. We also study the behaviour of critical layers, which are points\\nwhere the horizontal velocity vanishes, near the surface.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T09:32:00Z\"}"}
