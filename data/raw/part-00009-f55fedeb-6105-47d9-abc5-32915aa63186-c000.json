{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17626v1\", \"title\": \"Improving Open-World Object Localization by Discovering Background\", \"summary\": \"Our work addresses the problem of learning to localize objects in an\\nopen-world setting, i.e., given the bounding box information of a limited\\nnumber of object classes during training, the goal is to localize all objects,\\nbelonging to both the training and unseen classes in an image, during\\ninference. Towards this end, recent work in this area has focused on improving\\nthe characterization of objects either explicitly by proposing new objective\\nfunctions (localization quality) or implicitly using object-centric\\nauxiliary-information, such as depth information, pixel/region affinity map\\netc. In this work, we address this problem by incorporating background\\ninformation to guide the learning of the notion of objectness. Specifically, we\\npropose a novel framework to discover background regions in an image and train\\nan object proposal network to not detect any objects in these regions. We\\nformulate the background discovery task as that of identifying image regions\\nthat are not discriminative, i.e., those that are redundant and constitute low\\ninformation content. We conduct experiments on standard benchmarks to showcase\\nthe effectiveness of our proposed approach and observe significant improvements\\nover the previous state-of-the-art approaches for this task.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:48:46Z\"}"}
