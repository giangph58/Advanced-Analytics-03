{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17627v1\", \"title\": \"Fragmentation, Zero Modes, and Collective Bound States in Constrained\\n  Models\", \"summary\": \"Kinetically constrained models were originally introduced to capture slow\\nrelaxation in glassy systems, where dynamics are hindered by local constraints\\ninstead of energy barriers. Their quantum counterparts have recently drawn\\nattention for exhibiting highly degenerate eigenstates at zero energy -- known\\nas zero modes -- stemming from chiral symmetry. Yet, the structure and\\nimplications of these zero modes remain poorly understood. In this work, we\\nfocus on the properties of the zero mode subspace in quantum kinetically\\nconstrained models with a $U(1)$ particle-conservation symmetry. We use the\\n$U(1)$ East, which lacks inversion symmetry, and the inversion-symmetric $U(1)$\\nEast-West models to illustrate our two main results. First, we observe that the\\nsimultaneous presence of constraints and chiral symmetry generally leads to a\\nparametric increase in the number of zero modes due to the fragmentation of the\\nmany-body Hilbert space into disconnected sectors. Second, we generalize the\\nconcept of compact localized states from single particle physics and introduce\\nthe notion of collective bound states. We formulate sufficient criteria for\\ntheir existence, arguing that the degenerate zero mode subspace plays a central\\nrole, and demonstrate bound states in both example models. Our results motivate\\na systematic study of bound states and their relation to ergodicity breaking,\\ntransport, and other properties of quantum kinetically constrained models.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.dis-nn,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:49:16Z\"}"}
