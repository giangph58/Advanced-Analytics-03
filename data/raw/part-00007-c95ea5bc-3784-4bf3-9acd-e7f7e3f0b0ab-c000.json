{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04834v1\", \"title\": \"Learning Affine Correspondences by Integrating Geometric Constraints\", \"summary\": \"Affine correspondences have received significant attention due to their\\nbenefits in tasks like image matching and pose estimation. Existing methods for\\nextracting affine correspondences still have many limitations in terms of\\nperformance; thus, exploring a new paradigm is crucial. In this paper, we\\npresent a new pipeline designed for extracting accurate affine correspondences\\nby integrating dense matching and geometric constraints. Specifically, a novel\\nextraction framework is introduced, with the aid of dense matching and a novel\\nkeypoint scale and orientation estimator. For this purpose, we propose loss\\nfunctions based on geometric constraints, which can effectively improve\\naccuracy by supervising neural networks to learn feature geometry. The\\nexperimental show that the accuracy and robustness of our method outperform the\\nexisting ones in image matching tasks. To further demonstrate the effectiveness\\nof the proposed method, we applied it to relative pose estimation. Affine\\ncorrespondences extracted by our method lead to more accurate poses than the\\nbaselines on a range of real-world datasets.
