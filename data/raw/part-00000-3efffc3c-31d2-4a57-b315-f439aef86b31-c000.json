{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10475v1\", \"title\": \"Probing the Sivers Asymmetry with Transverse Energy-Energy Correlators\\n  in the Small-$x$ Regime\", \"summary\": \"We investigate transverse energy-energy correlators (TEECs) for both\\npolarized and unpolarized targets in the small-$x$ regime at the Electron-Ion\\nCollider (EIC). Focusing on the approximately back-to-back electroproduction of\\na hadron-electron pair, we apply transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD)\\nfactorization formulas that incorporate TMD evolution for both event-shape\\nobservables and expand them in terms of the small-$x$ dipole amplitude. This\\nallows us to write the TEEC off the transversely polarized proton in terms of a\\nC-odd interaction, corresponding to an odderon exchange. Due to the\\ncharge-conjugation-odd nature of the small-$x$ quark Sivers function, we\\nrestrict the sum over final hadronic states to positively and negatively\\ncharged hadrons separately. We present numerical predictions for the TEEC\\nSivers asymmetry at the EIC and find the magnitude of the asymmetry to be on\\nthe $0.1 \\\\%$ level. This channel offers a promising avenue for benchmarking the\\nstill largely unconstrained odderon amplitude.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:58:18Z\"}"}
