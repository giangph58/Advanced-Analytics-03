However, inferred model parameters can vary\\nsignificantly with the chosen physics model, highlighting the importance of\\nproperly accounting for theoretical uncertainties. In this article, we\\nexplicitly incorporate these uncertainties using Gaussian processes that model\\nthe domain of validity of theoretical models, integrating prior knowledge about\\nwhere a theory applies and where it does not. We demonstrate the effectiveness\\nof this approach using two systems: a simple ball drop experiment and\\nmulti-stage heavy-ion simulations. In both cases incorporating model\\ndiscrepancy leads to improved parameter estimates, with systematic improvements\\nobserved as additional experimental observables are integrated.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,nucl-th,physics.data-an\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:53:39Z\"}"}
