{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16385v1\", \"title\": \"Distributed Space Resource Logistics Architecture Optimization under\\n  Economies of Scale\", \"summary\": \"This paper proposes an optimization framework for distributed resource\\nlogistics system design to support future multimission space exploration. The\\nperformance and impact of distributed In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU)\\nsystems in facilitating space transportation are analyzed. The proposed\\nframework considers technology trade studies, deployment strategy, facility\\nlocation evaluation, and resource logistics after production for distributed\\nISRU systems. We develop piecewise linear sizing and cost estimation models\\nbased on economies of scale that can be easily integrated into network-based\\nmission planning formulations. A case study on a multi-mission cislunar\\nlogistics campaign is conducted to demonstrate the value of the proposed method\\nand evaluate key tradeoffs to compare the performance of distributed ISRU\\nsystems with traditional concentrated ISRU. Finally, a comprehensive\\nsensitivity analysis is performed to assess the proposed system under varying\\nconditions, comparing concentrated and distributed ISRU systems.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T03:26:43Z\"}"}
