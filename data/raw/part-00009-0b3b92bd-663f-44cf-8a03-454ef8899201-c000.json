{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19612v1\", \"title\": \"Relative Advantage: Quantifying Performance in Noisy Competitive\\n  Settings\", \"summary\": \"Performance measurement in competitive domains is frequently confounded by\\nshared environmental factors that obscure true performance differences. For\\ninstance, absolute metrics can be heavily influenced by factors as varied as\\nweather conditions in sports, prevailing economic climates in business\\nevaluations, or the socioeconomic background of student populations in\\neducation. This paper develops a unified mathematical framework for relative\\nperformance metrics that systematically eliminates shared environmental effects\\nthrough a principled transformation that will help improve interpretation of\\nperformance metrics. We formalise the mechanism of environmental noise\\ncancellation using signal-to-noise ratio analysis and establish theoretical\\nbounds on metric performance. Through comprehensive simulations across diverse\\nparameter configurations, we demonstrate that relative metrics consistently\\noutperform absolute ones under specified conditions, with improvements up to\\n28\\\\% in classification accuracy when environmental noise dominates individual\\nvariations. As an example, we validate the mathematical framework using\\nreal-world rugby performance data, confirming that relativised metrics provide\\nsubstantially better predictive power than their absolute counterparts. Our\\napproach offers both theoretical insights into the conditions governing metric\\neffectiveness and practical guidance for measurement system design across\\ncompetitive domains from sports analytics to financial performance evaluation\\nand healthcare outcomes research.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.data-an\", \"categories\": \"physics.data-an\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T09:19:01Z\"}"}
