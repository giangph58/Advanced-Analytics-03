{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14956v1\", \"title\": \"Considerations on the Design of Transceivers for Ambient Internet of\\n  Things\", \"summary\": \"The Ambient IoT (A-IoT) will introduce trillions of connections and enable\\nlow-cost battery-less devices. The A-IoT nodes can achieve low cost ($\\\\sim \\\\$\\n0.1$ like RFID tag), sub-1mW average power consumption, $\\\\leq 10$ kbps data\\nrates, maintenance-free working for decades, cm-scale size, cm-scale size, and\\nsupporting applications like supply chain and smart agriculture. The\\ntransceiver challenges in A-IoT focus on sub-mW receivers and crystal-less\\nclock generation. The paper proposes an \\\"approximate low-IF\\\" receiver and\\n\\\"carrier-auxiliary IF feedback\\\" LO synthesizer architecture for Type-B/C A-IoT\\ndevices, which tracks the RF carrier frequency and eliminates external\\ncrystals. The proposed receiver and LO generator are implemented using 55nm\\nCMOS technology. After locking the LO calibration loop, the receiver\\nsensitivity is better than -88 dBm. The proposed receiver architecture will\\npromote \\\"zero power\\\" devices for ubiquitous IoT connectivity, bridging digital\\nand physical worlds.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.AR,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T08:31:41Z\"}"}
