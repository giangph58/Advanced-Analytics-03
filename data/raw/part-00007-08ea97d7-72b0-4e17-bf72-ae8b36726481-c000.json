{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04590v1\", \"title\": \"TetWeave: Isosurface Extraction using On-The-Fly Delaunay Tetrahedral\\n  Grids for Gradient-Based Mesh Optimization\", \"summary\": \"We introduce TetWeave, a novel isosurface representation for gradient-based\\nmesh optimization that jointly optimizes the placement of a tetrahedral grid\\nused for Marching Tetrahedra and a novel directional signed distance at each\\npoint. TetWeave constructs tetrahedral grids on-the-fly via Delaunay\\ntriangulation, enabling increased flexibility compared to predefined grids. The\\nextracted meshes are guaranteed to be watertight, two-manifold and\\nintersection-free. The flexibility of TetWeave enables a resampling strategy\\nthat places new points where reconstruction error is high and allows to\\nencourage mesh fairness without compromising on reconstruction error. This\\nleads to high-quality, adaptive meshes that require minimal memory usage and\\nfew parameters to optimize. Consequently, TetWeave exhibits near-linear memory\\nscaling relative to the vertex count of the output mesh - a substantial\\nimprovement over predefined grids. We demonstrate the applicability of TetWeave\\nto a broad range of challenging tasks in computer graphics and vision, such as\\nmulti-view 3D reconstruction, mesh compression and geometric texture\\ngeneration.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GR\", \"categories\": \"cs.GR,cs.CV,I.3.5\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T17:32:49Z\"}"}
