Evidence from\\n  Experimental and Scanner Data\", \"summary\": \"Choice consistency with utility maximization is a fundamental assumption in\\neconomic analysis and is extensively measured across various contexts. Here we\\ninvestigate the generalizability of consistency measures derived from\\npurchasing decisions using supermarket scanner data and budgetary decisions\\nfrom lab-in-the-field experiments. We observe a lack of correlation between\\nconsistency scores from supermarket purchasing decisions and those from risky\\ndecisions in the experiment. However, we observe moderate correlations among\\nexperimental tasks and low to moderate correlations across purchasing\\ncategories and time periods within the supermarket. These results suggest that\\nchoice consistency may be characterized as a multidimensional skill set.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:22:36Z\"}"}
