The broad\\nsuccess of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has enriched the horizon of\\nvideo compression into novel paradigms by leveraging end-to-end optimized\\nneural models. In this survey, we first provide a comprehensive and systematic\\noverview of recent literature on end-to-end optimized learned video coding,\\ncovering the spectrum of pioneering efforts in both uni-directional and\\nbi-directional prediction based compression model designation. We further delve\\ninto the optimization techniques employed in learned video compression (LVC),\\nemphasizing their technical innovations, advantages. Some standardization\\nprogress is also reported. Furthermore, we investigate the system design and\\nhardware implementation challenges of the LVC inclusively. Finally, we present\\nthe extensive simulation results to demonstrate the superior compression\\nperformance of LVC models, addressing the question that why learned codecs and\\nAI-based video technology would have with broad impact on future visual\\nintelligence research.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T09:03:16Z\"}"}
