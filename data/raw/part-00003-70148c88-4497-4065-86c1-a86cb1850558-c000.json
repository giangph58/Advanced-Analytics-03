{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01525v1\", \"title\": \"Rapid Muon Tomography for Border Security\", \"summary\": \"Cosmic-ray muon tomography is a promising technique for border security\\napplications, leveraging highly penetrating cosmic-ray muons and their\\ninteractions with various materials to generate 3D images of large and dense\\nobjects, such as shipping containers. Using scattering and absorption of muons\\nas they pass through dense cargo materials, muon tomography provides a viable\\nsolution for customs and border security by enabling the verification of\\nshipping container declarations and preventing illegal trafficking. In this\\nstudy, we utilized Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of\\nmuon tomography for cargo characterization and contraband detection in various\\nsmuggling scenarios. Our results demonstrate that muon tomography can offers a\\nnovel approach to cargo inspection, moving beyond traditional 3D image\\nreconstruction. Instead, it analyzes muon scattering and absorption rates in\\nreal time during scanning, enabling the prompt detection of discrepancies\\nbetween actual cargo contents and declared goods within just 10 to 20 seconds.\\nThis method is particularly effective for cargo consisting of uniform loads\\ncomposed of a single material or product, a common practice in shipping. Unlike\\ntraditional X-ray radiography, which analyzes detailed 2D images, muon\\ntomography begins evaluating scatter-absorption rates within the first few\\nseconds of scanning. This early assessment enables cargo evaluation long before\\na statistically reliable 3D image is formed, significantly improving scanning\\nthroughput without disrupting trade flow.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T09:12:31Z\"}"}
