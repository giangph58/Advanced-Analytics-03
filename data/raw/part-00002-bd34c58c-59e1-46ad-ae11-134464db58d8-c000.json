{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21761v1\", \"title\": \"Is Stephen Curry really a guard? New perspective on players typology\\n  using functional data analysis\", \"summary\": \"We present a novel representation of NBA players' shooting patterns based on\\nFunctional Data Analysis (FDA). Each player's charts of made and missed shots\\nare treated as smooth functional data defined over a two-dimensional domain\\ncorresponding to the offensive half-court. This continuous representation\\nenables a parsimonious multivariate functional principal components analysis\\n(MFPCA) decomposition, producing a set of common principal component functions\\nthat capture the primary modes of variability in shooting patterns, along with\\nplayer-specific scores that quantify individual deviations from the average\\nbehavior. We first interpret the principal component functions to characterize\\nthe main sources of variation in shooting tendencies. We then apply $k$-medoids\\nclustering to the principal component scores to construct a data-driven\\ntaxonomy of players. Comparing our empirical clusters to conventional NBA\\nposition labels reveals low agreement, suggesting that our shooting-pattern\\nrepresentation might capture aspects of playing style not fully reflected in\\nofficial designations. The proposed methodology provides a flexible,\\ninterpretable, and continuous framework for analyzing player tendencies, with\\npotential applications in coaching, scouting, and historical player or match\\ncomparisons.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T16:01:56Z\"}"}
