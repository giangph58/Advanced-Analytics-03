{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21390v1\", \"title\": \"Statistical process discovery\", \"summary\": \"Stochastic process discovery is concerned with deriving a model capable of\\nreproducing the stochastic character of observed executions of a given process,\\nstored in a log. This leads to an optimisation problem in which the model's\\nparameter space is searched for, driven by the resemblance between the log's\\nand the model's stochastic languages. The bottleneck of such optimisation\\nproblem lay in the determination of the model's stochastic language which\\nexisting approaches deal with through, hardly scalable, exact computation\\napproaches. In this paper we introduce a novel framework in which we combine a\\nsimulation-based Bayesian parameter inference scheme, used to search for the\\n``optimal'' instance of a stochastic model, with an expressive statistical\\nmodel checking engine, used (during inference) to approximate the language of\\nthe considered model's instance. Because of its simulation-based nature, the\\npayoff is that, the runtime for discovering of the optimal instance of a model\\ncan be easily traded in for accuracy, hence allowing to treat large models\\nwhich would result in a prohibitive runtime with non-simulation based\\nalternatives. We validate our approach on several popular event logs concerning\\nreal-life systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.FL\", \"categories\": \"cs.FL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T07:44:17Z\"}"}
