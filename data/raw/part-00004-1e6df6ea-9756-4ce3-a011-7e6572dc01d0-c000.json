The formation of antiferromagnetic spin\\nchains with the effective intrachain coupling of $J\\\\simeq 100$\\\\,K is attributed\\nto the occurrence of longer Cu--Cu distances and larger Cu--O--Cu bond angles\\nbetween the structural chains within the layers of the brochantite structure.\\nThese zigzag spin chains are additionally stabilized by ferromagnetic couplings\\n$J_2$ between second neighbors and moderately frustrated by several\\nantiferromagnetic couplings that manifest themselves in the reduced N\\\\'eel\\ntemperature of the material. Pressure tuning of the brochantite structure keeps\\nits monoclinic symmetry unchanged and leads to the growth of antiferromagnetic\\n$J$ with the rate of 3.2\\\\,K/GPa, although this trend is primarily caused by the\\nenhanced ferromagnetic couplings $J_2$. Our results show that the nature of\\nmagnetic couplings in brochantite and in other layered Cu$^{2+}$ minerals is\\ncontrolled by the size of the lattice translation along their structural chains\\nand by the extent of the layer buckling.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.other\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T13:10:55Z\"}"}
