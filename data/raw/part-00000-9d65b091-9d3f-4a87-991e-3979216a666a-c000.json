It is formally\\nproved that combining rotation with a generic condition concerning the\\ntransverse intersection between the three-dimensional invariant manifolds of\\nthe periodic solutions, all sets are highly distorted by the first return map\\nand hyperbolic three-dimensional horseshoes emerge, accumulating on the\\nnetwork. Infinitely many linked horseshoes prompt the coexistence of infinitely\\nmany saddle-type invariant sets for all values of $\\\\gamma\\\\gtrsim 0$ belonging\\nto the heteroclinic class of the two hyperbolic periodic solutions. We apply\\nthe results to a particular unfolding of the Hopf-Hopf singularity, the so\\ncalled \\\\emph{Gaspard-type unfolding}.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T16:39:06Z\"}"}
