{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20695v1\", \"title\": \"Inhomogeneous Phase Stiffness in $2$D $s$-wave Disordered\\n  Superconductors\", \"summary\": \"We investigate the effect of white-noise disorder on the local phase\\nstiffness and thermodynamic properties of a two-dimensional $s$-wave\\nsuperconductor. Starting from a local attractive model and using path-integral\\nformalism, we derive an effective action by decoupling the superconducting\\norder parameter into amplitude and phase components in a gauge-invariant\\nmanner. Perturbative techniques are applied to the phase fluctuation sector to\\nderive an effective phase-only XY model for disordered superconducting systems.\\nSolving the saddle-point Green's function using Bogoliubov-de Gennes theory, we\\ncalculate the distributions of nearest-neighbor couplings for various disorder\\nstrengths. A single-peak distribution is observed for low disorder strength,\\nwhich becomes bimodal with one peak at negative couplings as the disorder\\nstrength increases. The local phase stiffness remains randomly distributed\\nthroughout the lattice and shows no correlation with pairing amplitudes. The\\ntemperature dependence of the superfluid stiffness ($J_s$) is studied using\\nMonte Carlo simulations. At strong disorder and low temperatures, $J_s$\\nincreases with increasing temperature, exhibiting anomalous behavior that may\\nindicate the onset of a glassy transition. Additionally, calculations of the\\nEdwards-Anderson order parameter in this disorder regime suggest the emergence\\nof a $phase$-$glass$ state at very low temperatures.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T12:19:49Z\"}"}
