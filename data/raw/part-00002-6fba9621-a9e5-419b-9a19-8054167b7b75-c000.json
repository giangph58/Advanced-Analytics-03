In this work, we propose\\nconstructions for $BH(m,(n-1)n)$ then $BH(m,(\\\\frac{n}{2}-1)n)$, when $n$ and\\n$m$ are even numbers, using the existing $BH(m,n)$. For each case, we provide\\ntwo construction methods: one uses a single input Butson matrix, and another\\nuses two input Butson matrices. Moreover, we present some results about the\\nconstruction of Hadamard matrices.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T15:32:05Z\"}"}
