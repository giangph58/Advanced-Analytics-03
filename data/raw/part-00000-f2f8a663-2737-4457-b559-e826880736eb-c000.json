The simulated system closely\\nfollows a previously reported model. We uncover an exceptional dynamical regime\\nof agent dynamics that has been overlooked heretofore. It appears robustly\\noptimal across varying physical parameters and inference tasks, thus providing\\nvaluable insights into computation and inference with physical systems more\\ngenerally. The ability to form effective mechanisms for information processing\\nare primarily determined by the system's own intrinsic relaxation abilities.\\nThese are identifiable when probing the system without a specific inference\\ngoal and manifest when testing minimalistic single-particle reservoirs. The\\nregime that achieves optimal computation is situated just below the critical\\ndamping threshold, involving a microscopic dynamical relaxation with multiple\\nstages. The optimal system is adaptable under chaotic external driving, due to\\na diversity in response mechanisms that emerge like rapid alternations between\\nquasi-stationary and highly nonlinear dynamical states. Both coherent and\\nincoherent dynamics contribute to their operation, partly at dissimilar scales\\nof space and delay time. Correlations on agent dynamics can indicate the\\nbest-performing regimes and onsets of tight relationships between the\\nresponding system and the fluctuating driver. As this model of computation is\\ninterpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding\\nlearning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body\\nphysics out of equilibrium.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.AO\", \"categories\": \"nlin.AO,cond-mat.soft,cs.LG,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T17:09:14Z\"}"}
