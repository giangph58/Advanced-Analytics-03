We classified our dataset of 144 objects into a\\nwidely used 4-class taxonomic system of TNOs. No such previous classification\\nwas available in the literature for most of these objects. From absolute\\nmagnitudes and average albedos, an estimation of the diameters of all these\\nobjects is obtained. Correlations involving colours, orbital parameters,\\ndynamical classes and sizes are also discussed. In particular, our largest\\nreddest object has a diameter of $390^{+68}_{-53}$ km and our largest cold\\nclassical, $255^{+19}_{-17}$ km. Also, a weak correlation between colour and\\ninclination is found within the population of resonant TNOs in addition to weak\\ncorrelations between colour and phase slope in different bands.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T17:56:23Z\"}"}
