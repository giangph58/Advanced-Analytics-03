{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17346v1\", \"title\": \"Dual-Individual Genetic Algorithm: A Dual-Individual Approach for\\n  Efficient Training of Multi-Layer Neural Networks\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces an enhanced Genetic Algorithm technique called\\nDual-Individual Genetic Algorithm (Dual-Individual GA), which optimizes neural\\nnetworks for binary image classification tasks, such as cat vs. non-cat\\nclassification. The proposed method employs only two individuals for crossover,\\nrepresented by two parameter sets: Leader and Follower. The Leader focuses on\\nexploitation, representing the primary optimal solution at even-indexed\\npositions (0, 2, 4, ...), while the Follower promotes exploration by preserving\\ndiversity and avoiding premature convergence, operating at odd-indexed\\npositions (1, 3, 5, ...). Leader and Follower are modeled as two phases or\\nroles. The key contributions of this work are threefold: (1) a self-adaptive\\nlayer dimension mechanism that eliminates the need for manual tuning of layer\\narchitectures; (2) generates two parameter sets, leader and follower parameter\\nsets, with 10 layer architecture configurations (5 for each set), ranked by\\nPareto dominance and cost. post-optimization; and (3) demonstrated superior\\nperformance compared to traditional gradient-based methods. Experimental\\nresults show that the Dual-Individual GA achieves 99.04% training accuracy and\\n80% testing accuracy (cost = 0.034) on a three-layer network with architecture\\n[12288, 17, 4, 1], outperforming a gradient-based approach that achieves 98%\\ntraining accuracy and 80% testing accuracy (cost = 0.092) on a four-layer\\nnetwork with architecture [12288, 20, 7, 5, 1]. These findings highlight the\\nefficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method in optimizing neural\\nnetworks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NE\", \"categories\": \"cs.NE,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T08:04:08Z\"}"}
