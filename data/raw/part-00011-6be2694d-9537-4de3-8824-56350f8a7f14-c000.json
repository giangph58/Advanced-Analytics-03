{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21842v1\", \"title\": \"Cryptography without Long-Term Quantum Memory and Global Entanglement\", \"summary\": \"We show how oracles which only allow for classical query access can be used\\nto construct a variety of quantum cryptographic primitives which do not require\\nlong-term quantum memory or global entanglement. Specifically, if a quantum\\nparty can execute a semi-quantum token scheme (Shmueli 2022) with probability\\nof success $1/2 + \\\\delta$, we can build powerful cryptographic primitives with\\na multiplicative logarithmic overhead for the desired correctness error. Our\\nscheme makes no assumptions about the quantum party's noise model except for a\\nsimple independence requirement: noise on two sets of non-entangled hardware\\nmust be independent.\\n  Using semi-quantum tokens and oracles which can only be queried classically,\\nwe first show how to construct a \\\"short-lived\\\" semi-quantum one-time program\\n(OTP) which allows a classical sending party to prepare a one-time program on\\nthe receiving party's quantum computer. We then show how to use this\\nsemi-quantum OTP to construct a semi-quantum \\\"stateful obfuscation\\\" scheme\\n(which we term \\\"RAM obfuscation\\\"). Importantly, the RAM obfuscation scheme does\\nnot require long-term quantum memory or global entanglement. Finally, we show\\nhow RAM obfuscation can be used to build long-lived one-time programs and\\ncopy-protection schemes.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:51:25Z\"}"}
