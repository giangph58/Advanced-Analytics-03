The approximate operators are defined by adding a\\nrescaled function to the two-dimensional Laplacian such that the support of the\\nperturbation thus produced converges to a point in the limit of the rescaling,\\nand we also impose suitable renormalizations of the coupling constants. The\\nfirst main theorem assumes the zero total mass of the function for rescaling\\nand proves limits of the approximate resolvents up to an extended criticality\\ndefined by two levels of phase transitions. The second main theorem handles the\\ncase of positive total mass of the function for rescaling and proves an\\nasymptotic expansion of a multivariate density induced by the approximate\\nresolvent. Moreover, this expansion is valid beyond criticality.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T16:52:58Z\"}"}
