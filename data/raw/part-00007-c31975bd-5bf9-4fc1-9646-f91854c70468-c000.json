{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00701v1\", \"title\": \"A log-depth in-place quantum Fourier transform that rarely needs\\n  ancillas\", \"summary\": \"When designing quantum circuits for a given unitary, it can be much cheaper\\nto achieve a good approximation on most inputs than on all inputs. In this work\\nwe formalize this idea, and propose that such \\\"optimistic quantum circuits\\\" are\\noften sufficient in the context of larger quantum algorithms. For the rare\\nalgorithm in which a subroutine needs to be a good approximation on all inputs,\\nwe provide a reduction which transforms optimistic circuits into general ones.\\nApplying these ideas, we build an optimistic circuit for the in-place quantum\\nFourier transform (QFT). Our circuit has depth $O(\\\\log (n / \\\\epsilon))$ for\\ntunable error parameter $\\\\epsilon$, uses $n$ total qubits, i.e. no ancillas, is\\nlogarithmically local for input qubits arranged in 1D, and is measurement-free.\\nThe circuit's error is bounded by $\\\\epsilon$ on all input states except an\\n$O(\\\\epsilon)$-sized fraction of the Hilbert space. The circuit is also rather\\nsimple and thus may be practically useful. Combined with recent QFT-based fast\\narithmetic constructions [arXiv:2403.18006], the optimistic QFT yields\\nfactoring circuits of nearly linear depth using only $2n + O(n/\\\\log n)$ total\\nqubits. Applying our reduction technique, we also construct the first\\napproximate QFT to achieve the asymptotically optimal depth of $O(\\\\log\\n(n/\\\\epsilon))$ with a sublinear number of ancilla qubits, well-controlled error\\non all inputs, and no intermediate measurements.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T17:58:36Z\"}"}
