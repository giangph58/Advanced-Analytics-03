The size\\ndistribution of the droplets is determined dynamically in the condensation\\nprocess. A semi-quantitative argument is presented which suggests that, at zero\\ntemperature, a multiple droplet system has is a preferred scale $\\\\propto\\nv^{-d}$, with $d\\\\approx 0.5$, where $v$ is the rate of change of parameters at\\nthe time of droplet formation. Numerical simulations of two dimensional systems\\nstrongly support a power law, but with an exponent $d\\\\in(0.3,0.4)$.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T13:44:45Z\"}"}
