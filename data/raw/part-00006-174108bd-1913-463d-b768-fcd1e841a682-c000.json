We apply the Binder model, which was\\npreviously successfully applied to the recognition of nested named entities, to\\nextract nested terms. We obtained the best results of term recognition in all\\nthree tracks of the RuTermEval competition. In addition, we study the new task\\nof recognition of nested terms from flat training data annotated with terms\\nwithout nestedness. We can conclude that several approaches we proposed in this\\nwork are viable enough to retrieve nested terms effectively without nested\\nlabeling of them.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T16:15:37Z\"}"}
