{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11855v1\", \"title\": \"EngramNCA: a Neural Cellular Automaton Model of Memory Transfer\", \"summary\": \"This study introduces EngramNCA, a neural cellular automaton (NCA) that\\nintegrates both publicly visible states and private, cell-internal memory\\nchannels, drawing inspiration from emerging biological evidence suggesting that\\nmemory storage extends beyond synaptic modifications to include intracellular\\nmechanisms. The proposed model comprises two components: GeneCA, an NCA trained\\nto develop distinct morphologies from seed cells containing immutable \\\"gene\\\"\\nencodings, and GenePropCA, an auxiliary NCA that modulates the private\\n\\\"genetic\\\" memory of cells without altering their visible states. This\\narchitecture enables the encoding and propagation of complex morphologies\\nthrough the interaction of visible and private channels, facilitating the\\ngrowth of diverse structures from a shared \\\"genetic\\\" substrate. EngramNCA\\nsupports the emergence of hierarchical and coexisting morphologies, offering\\ninsights into decentralized memory storage and transfer in artificial systems.\\nThese findings have potential implications for the development of adaptive,\\nself-organizing systems and may contribute to the broader understanding of\\nmemory mechanisms in both biological and synthetic contexts.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NE\", \"categories\": \"cs.NE,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T08:23:09Z\"}"}
