{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17352v1\", \"title\": \"The Riemannian Means Field Classifier for EEG-Based BCI Data\", \"summary\": \"A substantial amount of research has demonstrated the robustness and accuracy\\nof the Riemannian minimum distance to mean (MDM) classifier for all kinds of\\nEEG-based brain--computer interfaces (BCIs). This classifier is simple, fully\\ndeterministic, robust to noise, computationally efficient, and prone to\\ntransfer learning. Its training is very simple, requiring just the computation\\nof a geometric mean of a symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrix per class. We\\npropose an improvement of the MDM involving a number of power means of SPD\\nmatrices instead of the sole geometric mean. By the analysis of 20 public\\ndatabases, 10 for the motor-imagery BCI paradigm and 10 for the P300 BCI\\nparadigm, comprising 587 individuals in total, we show that the proposed\\nclassifier clearly outperforms the MDM, approaching the state-of-the art in\\nterms of performance while retaining the simplicity and the deterministic\\nbehavior. In order to promote reproducible research, our code will be released\\nas open source.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T08:13:56Z\"}"}
