{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11236v1\", \"title\": \"Influence of a Xenon interlayer on dissociative electron attachment to\\n  deuterated methane on a platinum substrate\", \"summary\": \"We investigate the impact of intercalating a xenon layer between a thin\\ncondensed CD4 film of two monolayers (ML) and a platinum surface on the\\ndissociative electron attachment (DEA). The observed desorption results are\\ncompared with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which reveal the\\nbinding energies of various anionic and neutral species as a function of the\\nxenon film thickness on the Pt (111) substrate. The theoretical results suggest\\nthat 6 ML of xenon are sufficient to diminish the surface effect, enabling\\nphysisorbed anionic fragments to desorb from the CD4 film. In contrast, 20 ML\\n(approximately 10 nm) are experimentally necessary to achieve saturation in the\\ndesorption of D-. In addition, the presence of xenon layers enables the\\ncoupling of resonance states with Xe excited states, thereby inhibiting the\\nelectrons from returning to the metal. Aside from reducing surface\\ninteractions, the xenon interlayer significantly enhances DEA to CD4.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.chem-ph,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:38:32Z\"}"}
