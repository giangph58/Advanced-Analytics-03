Interactions between the turbulent flow and the granular\\nstructure give rise to transient erosion-deposition dynamics leading to various\\ntypes of particle transport. The subaqueous structures in the channel bed\\nevolves due to shear-stress-induced erosion, gravity-driven deposition, and\\nsubsequent particle transport. We study the centroid motion and the granular\\nstructure shape evolution. At lower end of our $Re-Fr$ parameter space, we\\nobserve no erosion and the structure remains at rest. At intermediate values of\\n$Re$ and $Fr$, we observe very slow erosion and the granular structure moves\\nvere slowly as a rigid body without significant shape deformation. Higher\\nvalues of $Re$ and $Fr$ causes vortex formation at the upstream of the dune\\nresulting in stronger erosion, rapid shape deformation and relatively higher\\ntranslation velocity of the centroid.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T11:18:18Z\"}"}
