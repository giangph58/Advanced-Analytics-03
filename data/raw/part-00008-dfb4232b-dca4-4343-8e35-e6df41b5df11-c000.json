{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06200v1\", \"title\": \"Day algebras\", \"summary\": \"In this paper we show that the Day monoidal product generalises in a\\nstraightforward way to other algebraic constructions and partial algebraic\\nconstructions on categories. This generalisation was motivated by its\\napplications in logic, for example in hybrid and separation logic. We use the\\ndescription of the Day monoidal product using profunctors to show that the\\ndefinition generalises to an extension of an arbitrary algebraic structure on a\\ncategory to a pseudo-algebraic structure on a functor category. We provide two\\nfurther extensions. First we consider the case where some of the operations on\\nthe category are partial, and second we show that the resulting operations on\\nthe functor category have adjoints (they are residuated).\", \"main_category\": \"math.CT\", \"categories\": \"math.CT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T16:42:54Z\"}"}
