Concretely, we are\\ninterested in predicting when such a system admits unimodal oscillations, i.e.,\\nwhen the output has a single-peaked period. Under the assumption that the\\nlinear system is stable and has an impulse response that is strictly\\nmonotonically decreasing on its infinite support, we take a novel approach in\\nusing the framework of total positivity to address our main question. It is\\nshown that unimodal self-oscillations can only exist if the number of positive\\nand negative elements in a period coincides. Based on this result, we derive\\nconditions for the existence of such oscillations, determine bounds on their\\nperiods, and address the question of uniqueness.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.SY,eess.SY,math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T11:56:40Z\"}"}
