{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05240v1\", \"title\": \"PADriver: Towards Personalized Autonomous Driving\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we propose PADriver, a novel closed-loop framework for\\npersonalized autonomous driving (PAD). Built upon Multi-modal Large Language\\nModel (MLLM), PADriver takes streaming frames and personalized textual prompts\\nas inputs. It autoaggressively performs scene understanding, danger level\\nestimation and action decision. The predicted danger level reflects the risk of\\nthe potential action and provides an explicit reference for the final action,\\nwhich corresponds to the preset personalized prompt. Moreover, we construct a\\nclosed-loop benchmark named PAD-Highway based on Highway-Env simulator to\\ncomprehensively evaluate the decision performance under traffic rules. The\\ndataset contains 250 hours videos with high-quality annotation to facilitate\\nthe development of PAD behavior analysis. Experimental results on the\\nconstructed benchmark show that PADriver outperforms state-of-the-art\\napproaches on different evaluation metrics, and enables various driving modes.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:36:07Z\"}"}
