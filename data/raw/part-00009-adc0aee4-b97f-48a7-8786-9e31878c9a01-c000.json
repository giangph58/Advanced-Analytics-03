However, the generation of dynamic and\\ninteractive 3D objects remains challenging due to the need for advanced 3D\\nmodeling and programming skills. To address this challenge, we present\\nMagicCraft, a system that generates functional 3D objects from natural language\\nprompts for metaverse platforms. MagicCraft uses generative AI models to manage\\nthe entire content creation pipeline: converting user text descriptions into\\nimages, transforming images into 3D models, predicting object behavior, and\\nassigning necessary attributes and scripts. It also provides an interactive\\ninterface for users to refine generated objects by adjusting features such as\\norientation, scale, seating positions, and grip points.\\n  Implemented on Cluster, a commercial metaverse platform, MagicCraft was\\nevaluated by 7 expert CG designers and 51 general users. Results show that\\nMagicCraft significantly reduces the time and skill required to create 3D\\nobjects. Users with no prior experience in 3D modeling or programming\\nsuccessfully created complex, interactive objects and deployed them in the\\nmetaverse. Expert feedback highlighted the system's potential to improve\\ncontent creation workflows and support rapid prototyping. By integrating\\nAI-generated content into metaverse platforms, MagicCraft makes 3D content\\ncreation more accessible.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T05:36:39Z\"}"}
