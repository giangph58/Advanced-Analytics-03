{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16485v1\", \"title\": \"On Developers' Self-Declaration of AI-Generated Code: An Analysis of\\n  Practices\", \"summary\": \"AI code generation tools have gained significant popularity among developers,\\nwho use them to assist in software development due to their capability to\\ngenerate code. Existing studies mainly explored the quality, e.g., correctness\\nand security, of AI-generated code, while in real-world software development,\\nthe prerequisite is to distinguish AI-generated code from human-written code,\\nwhich emphasizes the need to explicitly declare AI-generated code by\\ndevelopers. To this end, this study intends to understand the ways developers\\nuse to self-declare AI-generated code and explore the reasons why developers\\nchoose to self-declare or not. We conducted a mixed-methods study consisting of\\ntwo phases. In the first phase, we mined GitHub repositories and collected 613\\ninstances of AI-generated code snippets. In the second phase, we conducted a\\nfollow-up industrial survey, which received 111 valid responses. Our research\\nrevealed the practices followed by developers to self-declare AI-generated\\ncode. Most practitioners (76.6%) always or sometimes self-declare AI-generated\\ncode. In contrast, other practitioners (23.4%) noted that they never\\nself-declare AI-generated code. The reasons for self-declaring AI-generated\\ncode include the need to track and monitor the code for future review and\\ndebugging, and ethical considerations. The reasons for not self-declaring\\nAI-generated code include extensive modifications to AI-generated code and the\\ndevelopers' perception that self-declaration is an unnecessary activity. We\\nfinally provided guidelines for practitioners to self-declare AI-generated\\ncode, addressing ethical and code quality concerns.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T07:52:39Z\"}"}
