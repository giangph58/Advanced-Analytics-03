We construct shrinkage priors for\\nthe circulant correlation structure models and show that Bayesian predictive\\ndensities based on those priors asymptotically dominate Bayesian predictive\\ndensities based on Jeffreys priors under the Kullback-Leibler (KL) risk\\nfunction. While shrinkage of eigenvalues of covariance matrices of Gaussian\\nmodels has been successful, the proposed priors shrink a non-eigenvalue part of\\ncovariance matrices.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T03:39:52Z\"}"}
