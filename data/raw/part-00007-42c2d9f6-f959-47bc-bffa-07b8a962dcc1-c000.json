The current study assumes that the\\nEliashberg spectral function follows the Debye model in the low frequency\\nspectrum, whereas contributions from optical phonons dominate outside this\\nrange. Our findings confirm that, under a specific condition, we obtained a\\nformula for superconducting transition temperature. Furthermore, we compared\\nour formula with the Allen-Dynes formula and its modified version, and the\\nexact solutions. They reveal notable correlations.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T10:55:13Z\"}"}
