However, all previous material realizations\\nof this model have suffered from additional complications, ranging from\\nadditional interactions to impurity effects. Recently, a new quantum kagome\\nsystem has been identified in the form of averievite Cu(5-x)ZnxV2O10(CsCl),\\nfeaturing a unique double-layer spacing between the kagome planes. Using muon\\nspin spectroscopy we show that only a complete substitution (i.e. $x=2$) of\\ninterplanar copper ions leads to a quantum-disordered ground state. In\\ncontrast, the parent compound ($x=0$) exhibits long-range magnetic order, with\\na phase transition around 24 K. Experiments performed on the partially\\nsubstituted material ($x=1$) show that the transformation proceeds through an\\nintermediate disordered, partially frozen ground state, unaffected by pressures\\nup to 23 kbar. Our study provides a microscopic view of the magnetism of the\\ndecoupling of the kagome layers and establishes the averievite as a new\\nmaterial platform for the experimental study of the fully-decoupled kagome\\nlayers.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T15:43:50Z\"}"}
