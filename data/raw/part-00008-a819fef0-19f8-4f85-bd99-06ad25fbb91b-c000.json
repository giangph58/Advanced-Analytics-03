{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20430v1\", \"title\": \"Learning Laplacian Positional Encodings for Heterophilous Graphs\", \"summary\": \"In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that current graph positional\\nencodings (PEs) are not beneficial and could potentially hurt performance in\\ntasks involving heterophilous graphs, where nodes that are close tend to have\\ndifferent labels. This limitation is critical as many real-world networks\\nexhibit heterophily, and even highly homophilous graphs can contain local\\nregions of strong heterophily. To address this limitation, we propose Learnable\\nLaplacian Positional Encodings (LLPE), a new PE that leverages the full\\nspectrum of the graph Laplacian, enabling them to capture graph structure on\\nboth homophilous and heterophilous graphs. Theoretically, we prove LLPE's\\nability to approximate a general class of graph distances and demonstrate its\\ngeneralization properties. Empirically, our evaluation on 12 benchmarks\\ndemonstrates that LLPE improves accuracy across a variety of GNNs, including\\ngraph transformers, by up to 35% and 14% on synthetic and real-world graphs,\\nrespectively. Going forward, our work represents a significant step towards\\ndeveloping PEs that effectively capture complex structures in heterophilous\\ngraphs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T04:58:13Z\"}"}
