Here we present observational and modeling results of a\\nJWST NIRSpec and MIRI MRS integral-field-unit (IFU) spatial-spectral study of\\nthe inner coma of the Oort Cloud comet C/2017 K2 (PanSTARRS) at a heliocentric\\ndistance of 2.35 au. We find the comet is hyperactive (water ice active\\nfraction greater than or equal to 86%), with a nucleus radius of $<$4.2 km,\\nexhibiting strong emission from H$_{2}$O, $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and CO$_{2}$ as\\nwell as CN, H$_2$CO, CH$_3$OH, CH$_4$, C$_2$H$_6$, HCN, NH$_2$, and OH prompt\\nemission. The water ortho-to-para ratio is greater than or equal to 2.75. The\\nmodeled dust composition (relative mass fraction of the sub-micron grains) in\\nthe coma is dominated by amorphous carbon ($\\\\simeq 25$%), amorphous Mg:Fe\\nolivine ($\\\\simeq 19$%), amorphous Mg:Fe pyroxene ($\\\\simeq 16$%), and Mg-rich\\ncrystalline olivine ($\\\\simeq 39$%) and the crystalline mass fraction of the\\nsub-micron grains in the coma is, $f_{cryst} \\\\simeq 0.384 \\\\pm 0.065$. Analysis\\nof residuals in 3 to 8 $\\\\mu$m region of the spectral energy distribution\\nstrongly suggests the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs)\\nspecies in the coma.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:45:55Z\"}"}
