{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15826v1\", \"title\": \"Full waveform inversion with CNN-based velocity representation extension\", \"summary\": \"Full waveform inversion (FWI) updates the velocity model by minimizing the\\ndiscrepancy between observed and simulated data. However, discretization errors\\nin numerical modeling and incomplete seismic data acquisition can introduce\\nnoise, which propagates through the adjoint operator and affects the accuracy\\nof the velocity gradient, thereby impacting the FWI inversion accuracy. To\\nmitigate the influence of noise on the gradient, we employ a convolutional\\nneural network (CNN) to refine the velocity model before performing the forward\\nsimulation, aiming to reduce noise and provide a more accurate velocity update\\ndirection. We use the same data misfit loss to update both the velocity and\\nnetwork parameters, thereby forming a self-supervised learning procedure. We\\npropose two implementation schemes, which differ in whether the velocity update\\npasses through the CNN. In both methodologies, the velocity representation is\\nextended (VRE) by using a neural network in addition to the grid-based\\nvelocities. Thus, we refer to this general approach as VRE-FWI. Synthetic and\\nreal data tests demonstrate that the proposed VRE-FWI achieves higher velocity\\ninversion accuracy compared to traditional FWI, at a marginal additional\\ncomputational cost of approximately 1%.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.geo-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.geo-ph,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T12:14:38Z\"}"}
