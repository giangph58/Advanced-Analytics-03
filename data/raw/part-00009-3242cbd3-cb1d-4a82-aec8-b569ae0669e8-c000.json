{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16554v1\", \"title\": \"Temperature switchable self-propulsion activity of liquid crystalline\\n  microdroplets\", \"summary\": \"We report on a switchable emulsion droplet microswimmer by utilizing a\\ntemperature-dependent transition of the droplet phase. The droplets, made from\\na liquid crystalline (LC) smectic phase material ($T =$ 25 $^{\\\\circ}$C),\\nself-propel only in their nematic and isotropic phases at elevated temperatures\\n($T\\\\ge$ 33.5 $^{\\\\circ}$C). This transition between motile and non-motile states\\nis fully reversible - in the motile state, the droplets exhibit persistent\\nmotion and directional memory over multiple heating-cooling cycles. Further, we\\ndistinguish the state of rest from the state of motion by characterizing the\\nchemical and hydrodynamic fields of the droplets. Next, we map the motility\\nbehaviour of the droplets across varying surfactant concentrations and\\ntemperatures, observing that swimming occurs only at sufficiently high\\nsurfactant concentrations above and temperatures above the smectic-nematic\\nphase transition temperature $\\\\textit{i.e.}$ $T\\\\ge$ 33.5 $^{\\\\circ}$C. Our work\\nenvisions the potential of LC emulsion droplets as switchable microswimmers.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T09:32:19Z\"}"}
