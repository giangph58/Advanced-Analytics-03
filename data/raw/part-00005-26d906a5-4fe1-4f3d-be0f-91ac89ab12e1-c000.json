By\\nmodeling intensity functions as infinite-rank tensors within function spaces,\\nwe develop new algorithms to reveal optimal bias-variance trade-off for\\ninfinite-rank tensor estimation. Our methods dramatically enhance estimation\\naccuracy while simultaneously reducing computational complexity. To our\\nknowledge, this work marks the first application of matrix and tensor\\ntechinques to spatial point processes. Extensive numerical experiments further\\ndemonstrate that our techniques consistently outperform current\\nstate-of-the-art methods.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T13:25:17Z\"}"}
