Owing to its modular architecture and high-throughput\\ncapabilities, the framework effectively mitigates the computational complexity\\nand resource-intensive limitations associated with conventional PIMD\\napproaches. By integrating machine learning force fields (MLFFs) into the\\nframework, we rigorously tested its performance through two representative\\ncases: a small-molecule reaction system (double proton transfer in formic acid\\ndimer) and a bulk-phase transition system (water-ice phase transformation).\\nComputational results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves\\naccelerated PIMD simulations while preserving quantum mechanical accuracy.\\nThese findings show that nuclear quantum effects can be captured for complex\\nmolecular systems, using relatively low computational cost.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T05:01:56Z\"}"}
