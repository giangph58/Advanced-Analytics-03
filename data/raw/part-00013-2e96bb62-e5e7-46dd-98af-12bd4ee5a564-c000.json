{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20669v1\", \"title\": \"Advance Fake Video Detection via Vision Transformers\", \"summary\": \"Recent advancements in AI-based multimedia generation have enabled the\\ncreation of hyper-realistic images and videos, raising concerns about their\\npotential use in spreading misinformation. The widespread accessibility of\\ngenerative techniques, which allow for the production of fake multimedia from\\nprompts or existing media, along with their continuous refinement, underscores\\nthe urgent need for highly accurate and generalizable AI-generated media\\ndetection methods, underlined also by new regulations like the European Digital\\nAI Act. In this paper, we draw inspiration from Vision Transformer (ViT)-based\\nfake image detection and extend this idea to video. We propose an {original}\\n%innovative framework that effectively integrates ViT embeddings over time to\\nenhance detection performance. Our method shows promising accuracy,\\ngeneralization, and few-shot learning capabilities across a new, large and\\ndiverse dataset of videos generated using five open source generative\\ntechniques from the state-of-the-art, as well as a separate dataset containing\\nvideos produced by proprietary generative methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI,cs.MM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T11:51:07Z\"}"}
