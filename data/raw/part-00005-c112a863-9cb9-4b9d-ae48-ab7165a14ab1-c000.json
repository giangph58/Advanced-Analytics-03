{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11108v1\", \"title\": \"Benchmarking Vision Language Models on German Factual Data\", \"summary\": \"Similar to LLMs, the development of vision language models is mainly driven\\nby English datasets and models trained in English and Chinese language, whereas\\nsupport for other languages, even those considered high-resource languages such\\nas German, remains significantly weaker. In this work we present an analysis of\\nopen-weight VLMs on factual knowledge in the German and English language. We\\ndisentangle the image-related aspects from the textual ones by analyzing\\naccu-racy with jury-as-a-judge in both prompt languages and images from German\\nand international contexts. We found that for celebrities and sights, VLMs\\nstruggle because they are lacking visual cognition of German image contents.\\nFor animals and plants, the tested models can often correctly identify the\\nimage contents ac-cording to the scientific name or English common name but\\nfail in German lan-guage. Cars and supermarket products were identified equally\\nwell in English and German images across both prompt languages.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T11:55:24Z\"}"}
