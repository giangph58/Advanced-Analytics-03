However, the spatial misalignment between FA maps and\\ntractography atlases hinders their effective integration into predictive\\nmodels. To address this issue, we propose a CycleGAN based approach for\\ngenerating FA maps directly from T1-weighted MRI scans, representing the first\\napplication of this technique to both healthy and tumour-affected tissues. Our\\nmodel, trained on unpaired data, produces high fidelity maps, which have been\\nrigorously evaluated using Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Peak\\nSignal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), demonstrating particularly robust performance in\\ntumour regions. Radiological assessments further underscore the model's\\npotential to enhance clinical workflows by providing an AI-driven alternative\\nthat reduces the necessity for additional scans.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T16:05:22Z\"}"}
