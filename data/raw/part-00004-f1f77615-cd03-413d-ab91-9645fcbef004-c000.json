For magnetized plasmas, we obtain the\\nfirst explicit relation for two-dimensional anisotropic BGK modes with finite\\nmagnetic field, showing that only a finite number of angular modes can become\\nunstable and identifying a magnetic-field threshold for stabilization. In the\\ngravitational case, we establish a bound on the growth rate of core\\nperturbations, set by the potential's curvature. These results clarify how\\norbital constraints shape the spectrum and growth of kinetic instabilities in\\ncold, collisionless media.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:27:22Z\"}"}
