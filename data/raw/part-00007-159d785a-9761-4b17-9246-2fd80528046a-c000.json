In\\ninformation thermodynamics, the information flow is characterized by the\\nlearning rate, which is not invariant under coordinate transformations. To\\nformalize the property of the learning rate under variable transformations, we\\nintroduce a learning rate matrix. This matrix has the learning rates as its\\ndiagonal elements and characterizes the changes in the learning rates under\\nlinear coordinate transformations. The maximal eigenvalue of the symmetric part\\nof the learning rate matrix gives the maximal information flow under orthogonal\\ntransformations. Furthermore, we derive a new trade-off relation between the\\nlearning rate and the heat dissipation of a subsystem. Finally, we illustrate\\nthe results using analytically solvable yet experimentally feasible models.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T08:49:43Z\"}"}
