{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12940v1\", \"title\": \"A study of Andromeda to improve our knowledge on the evolution and dust\\n  production by AGB stars\", \"summary\": \"We study the AGB population of the galaxy M31, based on available HST and\\nSpitzer data,\\n  to characterize the individual sources in terms of mass, metallicity and\\nformation epoch\\n  of the progenitors. Particular attention is dedicated to the derivation of\\nthe dust\\n  production rate of the stars, in the attempt of determining the global\\ncurrent dust production\\n  rate of the galaxy, divided between the silicates and the carbonaceous dust\\ncontributions.\\n  We use results from stellar evolution modelling complemented by the\\ndescription of the\\n  dust formation process in the wind, to be used in a population synthesis\\napproach, based on\\n  the star formation history and age-metallicity relationship obtained in\\nprevious investigations.\\n  The comparison between the results from synthetic modelling and the data\\navailable are used\\n  for the characterization of AGB stars in M31.\\n  We find that the bulk of the AGB population of M31 is composed by low-mass\\nstars of\\n  different metallicity formed between 6 Gyr and 14 Gyr ago, with an\\nadditional, significant\\n  contribution from the progeny of 1.7-2.5Msun stars formed during the\\nsecondary peak\\n  in the star formation, which occurred between 1 and 2 Gyr ago. The dust\\nproduction rate of the\\n  galaxy is mostly provided by carbon stars, whose contribution is of the order\\nof\\n  4x10^{-4} Msun/yr, completed by silicates production from massive AGB stars,\\n  occurring at a rate of 6x10^{-5} Msun/yr. The implications of the present\\n  results on the reliability of AGB modelling are also commented.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T13:38:03Z\"}"}
