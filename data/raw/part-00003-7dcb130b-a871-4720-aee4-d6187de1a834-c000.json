We experimentally probe transport in a quantum Hall sample engineered\\nto host a tunable number of counter-propagating edge states. The latter are\\ncoupled by Landauer reservoirs, which force charge equilibration over a tunable\\neffective length. We show that charge transport is determined by the balance of\\nup- and downstream channels, with a ballistic regime emerging for unequal\\nnumbers of channels. For equal numbers, we observe a transition to a critical\\ndiffusive regime, characterized by a diverging equilibration length. Our\\napproach allows simulating the equilibration of hole-conjugate states and other\\nexotic quantum Hall effects with fully controlled parameters using\\nwell-understood quantum Hall states.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T16:19:55Z\"}"}
