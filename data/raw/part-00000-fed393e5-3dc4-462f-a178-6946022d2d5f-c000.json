In contrast to the classical\\ncase, we show that unital shift equivalence does not coincide with one-sided\\neventual conjugacy. We also prove that unital shift equivalent matrices define\\none-sided shifts of finite type that are continuously orbit equivalent.\\nConsequently, unitally shift equivalent matrices have isomorphic topological\\nfull groups and isomorphic Leavitt path algebras, the latter being related to\\nHazrat's graded classification conjecture in algebra.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS,math.OA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T05:33:31Z\"}"}
