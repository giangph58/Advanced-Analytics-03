This phenomenon is\\nfundamentally different from situations in which Poisson-Voronoi percolation\\nhas previously been studied.\\n  Our approach builds on a recent breakthrough of Fraczyk, Mellick and Wilkens\\n(arXiv:2307.01194) and provides an alternative proof strategy for Gaboriau's\\nfixed price problem. As a further application of our result, we give a new\\nclass of examples of non-amenable Cayley graphs that admit factor of iid bond\\npercolations with a unique infinite cluster and arbitrarily small expected\\ndegree, answering a question inspired by Hutchcroft-Pete (Invent. math. 221\\n(2020)).}\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,math.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T09:50:22Z\"}"}
