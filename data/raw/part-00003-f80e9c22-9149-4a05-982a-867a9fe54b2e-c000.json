{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12919v1\", \"title\": \"Retarded Causal Set Propagator in 2D Anti de-Sitter Spacetime\", \"summary\": \"We investigate the viability of Causal Set Theory (CST) as a framework for\\ndiscretizing $(1+1)$-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime (AdS$_{1+1}$). In\\nCST, spacetime is modeled as a locally finite, partially ordered set that\\nreflects the causal structure of events. This fundamentally discrete\\nperspective has shown promise in flat spacetime scenarios, while its\\napplication to curved geometries is a current field of study. We address this\\nby studying the retarded scalar field propagator on causal sets generated by\\nPoisson sprinkling in AdS$_{1+1}$. We first show the solution of the continuum\\npropagator using the Klein-Gordon equation, solved in terms of geodesic\\ndistance. On the discrete side, we employ Shumans path sum method to derive the\\ncorresponding propagator, emphasizing that it is valid even in curved\\nmanifolds. By performing numerical simulations, we compare the discrete\\npropagator to its continuum counterpart across various curvature scales. Our\\nresults show strong agreement and confirm that the causal set propagator\\naccurately captures the effects of curvature without requiring modifications to\\nthe flat-space jump amplitudes. These findings affirm the robustness of CST in\\napproximating field propagation in curved spacetimes and strongly support the\\nability of causal sets to fully capture the geometry of Lorentzian manifolds.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T13:08:20Z\"}"}
