{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04305v1\", \"title\": \"Near-Field MIMO Channel Acquisition: Geometry-Aided Feedback and\\n  Transmission Design\", \"summary\": \"Near-field (NF) line-of-sight (LoS) MIMO systems enable efficient channel\\nstate information (CSI) acquisition and precoding by exploiting known antenna\\ngeometries at both the base station (BS) and user equipment (UE). This paper\\nintroduces a compact parameterization of the NF LoS MIMO channel using two\\nangles of departure (AoDs) and a BS-UE relative rotation angle. The inclusion\\nof the second AoD removes the need for fine-grained distance grids imposed by\\nconventional NF channel parametrization. To address the user-specific uplink\\npilot overhead in multiuser NF CSI acquisition, we propose a scheme that uses a\\nfixed, UE-independent set of downlink pilots transmitted from a carefully\\nselected subset of BS antennas. In dominant LoS conditions, as few as four\\npilots suffice, with Cram\\\\'er-Rao bound (CRB) analysis confirming that\\nincreased antenna spacing improves estimation accuracy. Each UE estimates and\\nquantizes its angular parameters and feeds them back to the BS for\\ngeometry-based CSI reconstruction, eliminating the need for full channel\\nfeedback. To enhance robustness against noise, quantization errors, and\\nnon-line-of-sight (NLoS) components, we introduce a two-stage precoding method.\\nThe initial precoding is computed from estimated LoS CSI and refined through\\nbidirectional over-the-air (OTA) training. Furthermore, a two-step stream\\nallocation strategy reduces pilot and computational overhead. Simulations\\ndemonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high data rates with\\nsignificantly fewer OTA iterations, approaching the performance of perfect CSI.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T10:24:13Z\"}"}
