{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10988v1\", \"title\": \"Hyperlinearity via amenable near representations\", \"summary\": \"We characterize the amenability of unitary representations (in the sense of\\nBekka) via the existence of an orthonormal basis supporting an invariant\\nprobability charge. Based on this, we explore several natural notions of\\namenable near representations on Hilbert spaces. Establishing an analogue of a\\ntheorem about sofic groups by Elek and Szab\\\\'o, we prove that a group is\\nhyperlinear if and only if it admits an essentially free amenable near\\nrepresentation. This answers a question raised by Pestov and Kwiatkowska. For\\ncomparison, we also provide characterizations of Kirchberg's factorization\\nproperty, as well as Haagerup's property, along similar lines.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GR\", \"categories\": \"math.GR,math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T09:00:41Z\"}"}
