{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21810v1\", \"title\": \"A simple and effective approach for body part recognition on CT scans\\n  based on projection estimation\", \"summary\": \"It is well known that machine learning models require a high amount of\\nannotated data to obtain optimal performance. Labelling Computed Tomography\\n(CT) data can be a particularly challenging task due to its volumetric nature\\nand often missing and$/$or incomplete associated meta-data. Even inspecting one\\nCT scan requires additional computer software, or in the case of programming\\nlanguages $-$ additional programming libraries. This study proposes a simple,\\nyet effective approach based on 2D X-ray-like estimation of 3D CT scans for\\nbody region identification. Although body region is commonly associated with\\nthe CT scan, it often describes only the focused major body region neglecting\\nother anatomical regions present in the observed CT. In the proposed approach,\\nestimated 2D images were utilized to identify 14 distinct body regions,\\nproviding valuable information for constructing a high-quality medical dataset.\\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, it was compared against\\n2.5D, 3D and foundation model (MI2) based approaches. Our approach outperformed\\nthe others, where it came on top with statistical significance and F1-Score for\\nthe best-performing model EffNet-B0 of 0.980 $\\\\pm$ 0.016 in comparison to the\\n0.840 $\\\\pm$ 0.114 (2.5D DenseNet-161), 0.854 $\\\\pm$ 0.096 (3D VoxCNN), and 0.852\\n$\\\\pm$ 0.104 (MI2 foundation model). The utilized dataset comprised three\\ndifferent clinical centers and counted 15,622 CT scans (44,135 labels).\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:13:44Z\"}"}
