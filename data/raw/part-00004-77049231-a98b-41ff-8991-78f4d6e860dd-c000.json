These rules are crucial for real-time clinical decision\\nsupport systems and automated drug delivery systems for chronic diseases.\\nAlthough considerable statistical and machine learning DTR methods have been\\ndeveloped, they are designed for a small number of fixed decision points, and\\nthus can not adapt to real-time cases. This paper proposes a new semiparametric\\nBayesian method for estimating an optimal treatment regime in real-time, which\\nallows for the existence of latent individual level variables. Specifically,\\nrandom real-time DTRs are defined through interventional parameters, the\\noptimal values of which are estimated by maximizing the posterior predictive\\nutility. The proposed approach is compared with alternative methods using\\nsimulated datasets, and applied to estimate the optimal real-time oxytocin\\nadministration regime for preventing postpartum hemorrhage.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:33:51Z\"}"}
