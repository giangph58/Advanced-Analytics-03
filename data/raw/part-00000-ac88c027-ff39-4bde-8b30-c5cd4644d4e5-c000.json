{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23707v1\", \"title\": \"From Geometry to Culture: An Iterative VLM Layout Framework for Placing\\n  Objects in Complex 3D Scene Contexts\", \"summary\": \"3D layout tasks have traditionally concentrated on geometric constraints, but\\nmany practical applications demand richer contextual understanding that spans\\nsocial interactions, cultural traditions, and usage conventions. Existing\\nmethods often rely on rule-based heuristics or narrowly trained learning\\nmodels, making them difficult to generalize and frequently prone to orientation\\nerrors that break realism. To address these challenges, we define four\\nescalating context levels, ranging from straightforward physical placement to\\ncomplex cultural requirements such as religious customs and advanced social\\nnorms. We then propose a Vision-Language Model-based pipeline that inserts\\nminimal visual cues for orientation guidance and employs iterative feedback to\\npinpoint, diagnose, and correct unnatural placements in an automated fashion.\\nEach adjustment is revisited through the system's verification process until it\\nachieves a coherent result, thereby eliminating the need for extensive user\\noversight or manual parameter tuning. Our experiments across these four context\\nlevels reveal marked improvements in rotation accuracy, distance control, and\\noverall layout plausibility compared with native VLM. By reducing the\\ndependence on pre-programmed constraints or prohibitively large training sets,\\nour method enables fully automated scene composition for both everyday\\nscenarios and specialized cultural tasks, moving toward a universally adaptable\\nframework for 3D arrangement.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GR\", \"categories\": \"cs.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T04:09:00Z\"}"}
