A generalizable approach should capture many distinct road structures\\nand topologies, as well as consider traffic participants, and dynamic changes\\nin the environment, so that vehicles can navigate and perform motion planning\\ntasks even in the most difficult situations. Designing suitable feature spaces\\nfor neural network-based motion planers that encapsulate all kinds of road\\nscenarios is still an open research challenge. This paper tackles this\\nlearning-based generalization challenge and shows how graph representations of\\nroad networks can be leveraged by using multidimensional scaling (MDS)\\ntechniques in order to obtain such feature spaces. State-of-the-art graph\\nrepresentations and MDS approaches are analyzed for the autonomous driving use\\ncase. Finally, the option of embedding graph nodes is discussed in order to\\nperform easier learning procedures and obtain dimensionality reduction.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.ET,cs.SC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T13:20:32Z\"}"}
