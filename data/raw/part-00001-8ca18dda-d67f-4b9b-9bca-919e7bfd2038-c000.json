To make it robust, multiple cameras are needed to expand the field of\\nview. That is computationally challenging. Merging multiple views and using\\nQ-learning allows the design of more effective representations and optimization\\nof sample efficiency. Such a solution might be expensive to deploy. To mitigate\\nthis, we introduce a Merge And Disentanglement (MAD) algorithm that efficiently\\nmerges views to increase sample efficiency while augmenting with single-view\\nfeatures to allow lightweight deployment and ensure robust policies. We\\ndemonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our approach using Meta-World and\\nManiSkill3.
