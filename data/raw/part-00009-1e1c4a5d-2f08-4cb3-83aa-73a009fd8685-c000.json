{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07418v1\", \"title\": \"ThermoStereoRT: Thermal Stereo Matching in Real Time via Knowledge\\n  Distillation and Attention-based Refinement\", \"summary\": \"We introduce ThermoStereoRT, a real-time thermal stereo matching method\\ndesigned for all-weather conditions that recovers disparity from two rectified\\nthermal stereo images, envisioning applications such as night-time drone\\nsurveillance or under-bed cleaning robots. Leveraging a lightweight yet\\npowerful backbone, ThermoStereoRT constructs a 3D cost volume from thermal\\nimages and employs multi-scale attention mechanisms to produce an initial\\ndisparity map. To refine this map, we design a novel channel and spatial\\nattention module. Addressing the challenge of sparse ground truth data in\\nthermal imagery, we utilize knowledge distillation to boost performance without\\nincreasing computational demands. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple\\ndatasets demonstrate that ThermoStereoRT delivers both real-time capacity and\\nrobust accuracy, making it a promising solution for real-world deployment in\\nvarious challenging environments. Our code will be released on\\nhttps://github.com/SJTU-ViSYS-team/ThermoStereoRT\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T03:24:21Z\"}"}
