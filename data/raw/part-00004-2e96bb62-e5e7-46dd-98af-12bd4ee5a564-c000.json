{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20660v1\", \"title\": \"Quantum-Enhanced Hybrid Reinforcement Learning Framework for Dynamic\\n  Path Planning in Autonomous Systems\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, a novel quantum classical hybrid framework is proposed that\\nsynergizes quantum with Classical Reinforcement Learning. By leveraging the\\ninherent parallelism of quantum computing, the proposed approach generates\\nrobust Q tables and specialized turn cost estimations, which are then\\nintegrated with a classical Reinforcement Learning pipeline. The Classical\\nQuantum fusion results in rapid convergence of training, reducing the training\\ntime significantly and improved adaptability in scenarios featuring static,\\ndynamic, and moving obstacles. Simulator based evaluations demonstrate\\nsignificant enhancements in path efficiency, trajectory smoothness, and mission\\nsuccess rates, underscoring the potential of framework for real time,\\nautonomous navigation in complex and unpredictable environments. Furthermore,\\nthe proposed framework was tested beyond simulations on practical scenarios,\\nincluding real world map data such as the IIT Delhi campus, reinforcing its\\npotential for real time, autonomous navigation in complex and unpredictable\\nenvironments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.ET,cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T11:36:08Z\"}"}
