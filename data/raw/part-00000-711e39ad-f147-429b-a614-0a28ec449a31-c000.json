{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17529v1\", \"title\": \"IRA: Adaptive Interest-aware Representation and Alignment for\\n  Personalized Multi-interest Retrieval\", \"summary\": \"Online community platforms require dynamic personalized retrieval and\\nrecommendation that can continuously adapt to evolving user interests and new\\ndocuments. However, optimizing models to handle such changes in real-time\\nremains a major challenge in large-scale industrial settings. To address this,\\nwe propose the Interest-aware Representation and Alignment (IRA) framework, an\\nefficient and scalable approach that dynamically adapts to new interactions\\nthrough a cumulative structure. IRA leverages two key mechanisms: (1) Interest\\nUnits that capture diverse user interests as contextual texts, while\\nreinforcing or fading over time through cumulative updates, and (2) a retrieval\\nprocess that measures the relevance between Interest Units and documents based\\nsolely on semantic relationships, eliminating dependence on click signals to\\nmitigate temporal biases. By integrating cumulative Interest Unit updates with\\nthe retrieval process, IRA continuously adapts to evolving user preferences,\\nensuring robust and fine-grained personalization without being constrained by\\npast training distributions. We validate the effectiveness of IRA through\\nextensive experiments on real-world datasets, including its deployment in the\\nHome Section of NAVER's CAFE, South Korea's leading community platform.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T13:17:18Z\"}"}
