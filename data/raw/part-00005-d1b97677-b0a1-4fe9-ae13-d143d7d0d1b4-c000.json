In\\nthis context, information theoretic measures such as mutual information and\\nrelated polymorphs offer valuable insights. Here, we explore these measures in\\na minimal experimental model consisting of two hydrodynamically coupled\\ncolloidal particles, where a nonequilibrium drive is introduced via an\\nexponentially correlated noise acting on one of the particles. We show that the\\ninformation-theoretic tools considered enable a systematic, data-driven\\ndissection of information flow within the system. These measures allow us to\\nidentify the driving node and reconstruct the directional dependencies between\\nparticles. Notably, they help explain a recently observed, counterintuitive\\ntrend in the dependence of irreversibility on interaction strength under\\ncoarse-graining (B. Das et.al., arXiv:2405.00800 (2024)). Finally, our results\\ndemonstrate how directional information measures can uncover the hidden\\nstructure of nonequilibrium dynamics and provide a framework for studying\\nsimilar effects in more complex systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T11:32:19Z\"}"}
