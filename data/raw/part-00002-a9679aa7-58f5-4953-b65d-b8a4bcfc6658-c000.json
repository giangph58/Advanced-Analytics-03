The existing work that provides finite sample guarantees for\\nlinear system identification typically uses data from a single long system\\ntrajectory under i.i.d. random inputs, and assumes that the underlying dynamics\\nis truly linear. In contrast, we consider the problem of identifying a\\nlinearized model when the true underlying dynamics is nonlinear, given that\\nthere is a certain constraint on the region where one can initialize the\\nexperiments. We provide a multiple trajectories-based deterministic data\\nacquisition algorithm followed by a regularized least squares algorithm, and\\nprovide a finite sample error bound on the learned linearized dynamics. Our\\nerror bound shows that one can consistently learn the linearized dynamics, and\\ndemonstrates a trade-off between the error due to nonlinearity and the error\\ndue to noise. We validate our results through numerical experiments, where we\\nalso show the potential insufficiency of linear system identification using a\\nsingle trajectory with i.i.d. random inputs, when nonlinearity does exist.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ML\", \"categories\": \"stat.ML,cs.LG,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T05:26:52Z\"}"}
