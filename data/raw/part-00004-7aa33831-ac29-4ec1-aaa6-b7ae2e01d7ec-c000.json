{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17743v1\", \"title\": \"Realization of Temporally Connected Graphs Based on Degree Sequences\", \"summary\": \"Given an undirected graph $G$, the problem of deciding whether $G$ admits a\\nsimple and proper time-labeling that makes it temporally connected is known to\\nbe NP-hard (G\\\\\\\"obel et al., 1991). In this article, we relax this problem and\\nask whether a given degree sequence can be realized as a temporally connected\\ngraph. Our main results are a complete characterization of the feasible cases,\\nand a recognition algorithm that runs in $O(n)$ time for graphical degree\\nsequences (realized as simple temporal graphs) and in $O(n+m)$ time for\\nmultigraphical degree sequences (realized as non-simple temporal graphs, where\\nthe number of time labels on an edge corresponds to the multiplicity of the\\nedge in the multigraph). In fact, these algorithms can be made constructive at\\nessentially no cost. Namely, we give a constructive $O(n+m)$ time algorithm\\nthat outputs, for a given (multi)graphical degree sequence $\\\\mathbf{d}$, a\\ntemporally connected graph whose underlying (multi)graph is a realization of\\n$\\\\mathbf{d}$, if one exists.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T17:01:35Z\"}"}
