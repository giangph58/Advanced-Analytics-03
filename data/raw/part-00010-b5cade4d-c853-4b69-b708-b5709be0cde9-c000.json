The spectrum of these\\noperators provide important insights into system predictability and emergent\\nbehaviour, although efficiently estimating them from data can be challenging.\\nWe tackle this issue through the lens of general operator and representational\\nlearning, in which we approximate these linear operators using efficient\\nfinite-dimensional representations. Specifically, we machine-learn orthonormal,\\nlocally supported basis functions that are dynamically tailored to the system.\\nThis learned basis provides a particularly accurate approximation of the\\noperator's action as well as a nearly invariant finite-dimensional subspace. We\\nillustrate our approach with examples that showcase the retrieval of spectral\\nproperties from the estimated operator, and emphasise the dynamically adaptive\\nquality of the machine-learned basis.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS,cs.LG,cs.NA,math.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T09:32:39Z\"}"}
