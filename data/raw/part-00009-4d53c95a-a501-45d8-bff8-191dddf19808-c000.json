{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03542v1\", \"title\": \"Cosmic strings and domain walls of the QCD quark condensate with and\\n  without a hidden axion\", \"summary\": \"The chiral quark condensate of QCD, which spontaneously breaks the anomalous\\naxial symmetry, gives rise to axionic type global string-wall systems. If a\\nPeccei-Quinn type axion exists in the theory, the axionic strings are in\\ngeneral accompanied by winding of the QCD quark condensate. Depending on the\\naxion model the winding can proceed either in the $\\\\eta'$ or in the pion\\ndirection. This determines the structure of fermionic zero modes and the\\nanomaly inflow which has important astrophysical consequences. We point out\\nthat $\\\\eta'$ and pion string-wall systems exist in pure QCD, independently of\\nthe hidden axion. Strikingly, even if a hidden axion exists, the early\\ncosmology can be entirely dominated by string-wall systems formed by the QCD\\nquark condensate. We also discuss their role in the QCD phase transition and in\\nheavy-ion physics.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,astro-ph.CO,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T13:55:20Z\"}"}
