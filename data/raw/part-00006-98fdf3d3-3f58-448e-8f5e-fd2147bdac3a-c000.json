{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03735v1\", \"title\": \"Multi-Agent System for Comprehensive Soccer Understanding\", \"summary\": \"Recent advancements in AI-driven soccer understanding have demonstrated rapid\\nprogress, yet existing research predominantly focuses on isolated or narrow\\ntasks. To bridge this gap, we propose a comprehensive framework for holistic\\nsoccer understanding. Specifically, we make the following contributions in this\\npaper: (i) we construct SoccerWiki, the first large-scale multimodal soccer\\nknowledge base, integrating rich domain knowledge about players, teams,\\nreferees, and venues to enable knowledge-driven reasoning; (ii) we present\\nSoccerBench, the largest and most comprehensive soccer-specific benchmark,\\nfeaturing around 10K standardized multimodal (text, image, video) multi-choice\\nQA pairs across 13 distinct understanding tasks, curated through automated\\npipelines and manual verification; (iii) we introduce SoccerAgent, a novel\\nmulti-agent system that decomposes complex soccer questions via collaborative\\nreasoning, leveraging domain expertise from SoccerWiki and achieving robust\\nperformance; (iv) extensive evaluations and ablations that benchmark\\nstate-of-the-art MLLMs on SoccerBench, highlighting the superiority of our\\nproposed agentic system.
