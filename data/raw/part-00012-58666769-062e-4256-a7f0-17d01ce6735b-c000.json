{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20508v1\", \"title\": \"The Panel Complexity of Sortition: Is 12 Angry Men Enough?\", \"summary\": \"Sortition is the practice of delegating public decision-making to randomly\\nselected panels. Recently, it has gained momentum worldwide through its use in\\ncitizens' assemblies, sparking growing interest within the computer science\\ncommunity. One key appeal of sortition is that random panels tend to be more\\nrepresentative of the population than elected committees or parliaments. Our\\nmain conceptual contribution is a novel definition of representative panels,\\nbased on the Wasserstein distance from statistical learning theory. Using this\\ndefinition, we develop a framework for analyzing the panel complexity problem\\n-- determining the required panel size to ensure desirable properties. We focus\\non three key desiderata: (1) that efficiency at the panel level extends to the\\nwhole population, measured by social welfare; (2) that fairness guarantees for\\nthe panel translate to fairness for the population, captured by the core; and\\n(3) that the probability of an outlier panel, for which the decision\\nsignificantly deviates from the optimal one, remains low. We establish\\nnear-tight panel complexity guarantees for these desiderata across two\\nfundamental social choice settings: participatory budgeting and facility\\nlocation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GT\", \"categories\": \"cs.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T07:48:39Z\"}"}
