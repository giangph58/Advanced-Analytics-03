Confirming previous claims from the literature, we\\nshow in a didactically accessible manner that unlabeled data (i.e., cause\\nrealizations) do not improve the estimation of the parameters defining the\\nmechanism. Furthermore, we observe the importance of choosing an appropriate\\nprior for the cause and mechanism parameters, respectively. Specifically, we\\nshow that a factorized prior results in a factorized posterior, which resonates\\nwith Janzing and Sch\\\\\\\"olkopf's definition of independent causal mechanisms via\\nthe Kolmogorov complexity of the involved distributions and with the concept of\\nparameter independence of Heckerman et al.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T07:19:49Z\"}"}
