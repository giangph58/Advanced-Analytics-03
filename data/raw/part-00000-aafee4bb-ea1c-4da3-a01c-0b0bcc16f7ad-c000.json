In English, for example, words of Germanic and Latinate\\norigin exhibit different stress patterns, and a certain syntactic structure is\\nexclusive to Germanic verbs. When seeing them as a cognitive model, however,\\nsuch etymology-based generalizations face challenges in terms of learnability,\\nsince the historical origins of words are presumably inaccessible information\\nfor general language learners. In this study, we present computational evidence\\nindicating that the Germanic-Latinate distinction in the English lexicon is\\nlearnable from the phonotactic information of individual words. Specifically,\\nwe performed an unsupervised clustering on corpus-extracted words, and the\\nresulting word clusters largely aligned with the etymological distinction. The\\nmodel-discovered clusters also recovered various linguistic generalizations\\ndocumented in the previous literature regarding the corresponding etymological\\nclasses. Moreover, our findings also uncovered previously unrecognized features\\nof the quasi-etymological clusters, offering novel hypotheses for future\\nexperimental studies.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T05:20:08Z\"}"}
