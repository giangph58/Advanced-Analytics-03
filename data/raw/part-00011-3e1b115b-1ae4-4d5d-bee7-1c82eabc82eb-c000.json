{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11804v1\", \"title\": \"Advanced MST3 Encryption scheme based on generalized Suzuki 2-groups\", \"summary\": \"This article presents a method for enhancing the encryption algorithm in the\\nMST3 cryptosystem for generalized Suzuki 2-groups. The conventional MST\\ncryptosystem based on Suzuki groups utilizes logarithmic signatures (LS)\\nrestricted to the center of the group, resulting in an expansive array of\\nlogarithmic signatures. We propose an encryption scheme based on\\nmulti-parameter non-commutative groups, specifically selecting multi-parameter\\ngeneralized Suzuki 2-groups as the group construction framework. In our\\napproach, the logarithmic signature extends across the entire group, with\\ncipher security dependent on the group order. This design enables the\\ndevelopment of encryption optimized for implementation efficiency determined by\\nlogarithmic signature size while maintaining robust security through\\nappropriate key sizes and the finite field of group representation. The primary\\ninnovation in our encryption implementation lies in the sequential\\nde-encapsulation of keys from ciphertext using logarithmic signatures and\\nassociated keys. The security evaluation of the cipher relies on attack\\ncomplexity analysis, which is quantified through comprehensive key enumeration\\nmethodologies.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,math.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T06:32:45Z\"}"}
