Recent works utilize\\ndiffusion models to generate UAEs. However, these UAEs often lack naturalness\\nand imperceptibility due to simply optimizing in intermediate latent noises. In\\nlight of this, we propose SemDiff, a novel unrestricted adversarial attack that\\nexplores the semantic latent space of diffusion models for meaningful\\nattributes, and devises a multi-attributes optimization approach to ensure\\nattack success while maintaining the naturalness and imperceptibility of\\ngenerated UAEs. We perform extensive experiments on four tasks on three\\nhigh-resolution datasets, including CelebA-HQ, AFHQ and ImageNet. The results\\ndemonstrate that SemDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of\\nattack success rate and imperceptibility. The generated UAEs are natural and\\nexhibit semantically meaningful changes, in accord with the attributes'\\nweights. In addition, SemDiff is found capable of evading different defenses,\\nwhich further validates its effectiveness and threatening.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T09:58:04Z\"}"}
