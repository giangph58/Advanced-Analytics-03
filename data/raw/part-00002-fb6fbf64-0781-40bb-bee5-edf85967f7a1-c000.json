{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13177v1\", \"title\": \"Single-Shot Shape and Reflectance with Spatial Polarization Multiplexing\", \"summary\": \"We propose spatial polarization multiplexing (SPM) for reconstructing object\\nshape and reflectance from a single polarimetric image and demonstrate its\\napplication to dynamic surface recovery. Although single-pattern structured\\nlight enables single-shot shape reconstruction, the reflectance is challenging\\nto recover due to the lack of angular sampling of incident light and the\\nentanglement of the projected pattern and the surface color texture. We design\\na spatially multiplexed pattern of polarization that can be robustly and\\nuniquely decoded for shape reconstruction by quantizing the AoLP values. At the\\nsame time, our spatial-multiplexing enables single-shot ellipsometry of linear\\npolarization by projecting differently polarized light within a local region,\\nwhich separates the specular and diffuse reflections for BRDF estimation. We\\nachieve this spatial polarization multiplexing with a constrained de Bruijn\\nsequence. Unlike single-pattern structured light with intensity and color, our\\npolarization pattern is invisible to the naked eye and retains the natural\\nsurface appearance which is essential for accurate appearance modeling and also\\ninteraction with people. We experimentally validate our method on real data.\\nThe results show that our method can recover the shape, the Mueller matrix, and\\nthe BRDF from a single-shot polarimetric image. We also demonstrate the\\napplication of our method to dynamic surfaces.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:59:50Z\"}"}
