{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21596v1\", \"title\": \"Leveraging Pre-trained Large Language Models with Refined Prompting for\\n  Online Task and Motion Planning\", \"summary\": \"With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, there is an increasing\\ndemand for intelligent robots capable of assisting humans in daily tasks and\\nperforming complex operations. Such robots not only require task planning\\ncapabilities but must also execute tasks with stability and robustness. In this\\npaper, we present a closed-loop task planning and acting system, LLM-PAS, which\\nis assisted by a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM). While LLM-PAS plans\\nlong-horizon tasks in a manner similar to traditional task and motion planners,\\nit also emphasizes the execution phase of the task. By transferring part of the\\nconstraint-checking process from the planning phase to the execution phase,\\nLLM-PAS enables exploration of the constraint space and delivers more accurate\\nfeedback on environmental anomalies during execution. The reasoning\\ncapabilities of the LLM allow it to handle anomalies that cannot be addressed\\nby the robust executor. To further enhance the system's ability to assist the\\nplanner during replanning, we propose the First Look Prompting (FLP) method,\\nwhich induces LLM to generate effective PDDL goals. Through comparative\\nprompting experiments and systematic experiments, we demonstrate the\\neffectiveness and robustness of LLM-PAS in handling anomalous conditions during\\ntask execution.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T12:53:53Z\"}"}
