{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19695v1\", \"title\": \"SubGrapher: Visual Fingerprinting of Chemical Structures\", \"summary\": \"Automatic extraction of chemical structures from scientific literature plays\\na crucial role in accelerating research across fields ranging from drug\\ndiscovery to materials science. Patent documents, in particular, contain\\nmolecular information in visual form, which is often inaccessible through\\ntraditional text-based searches. In this work, we introduce SubGrapher, a\\nmethod for the visual fingerprinting of chemical structure images. Unlike\\nconventional Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) models that attempt\\nto reconstruct full molecular graphs, SubGrapher focuses on extracting\\nmolecular fingerprints directly from chemical structure images. Using\\nlearning-based instance segmentation, SubGrapher identifies functional groups\\nand carbon backbones, constructing a substructure-based fingerprint that\\nenables chemical structure retrieval. Our approach is evaluated against\\nstate-of-the-art OCSR and fingerprinting methods, demonstrating superior\\nretrieval performance and robustness across diverse molecular depictions. The\\ndataset, models, and code will be made publicly available.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T11:45:46Z\"}"}
