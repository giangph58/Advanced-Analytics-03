Within this structure,\\ncones naturally possess three distinct topologies: lower, upper, and symmetric.\\nIn this paper, we consider the Hyers-Ulam type stability of the Pexiderized\\nCauchy functional equation $f(x+y)=g(x)+h(y)$ in locally convex cones.\\nAdditionally, we present several significant corollaries that follow from our\\nprimary findings.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T08:21:30Z\"}"}
