Our motivation for the Wasserstein case comes from\\noptimal-transport-based trajectory inference, where a developing population of\\ncells traces out a curve in Wasserstein space. Our framework enables new\\nexperimental procedures for collecting high-density time-courses of developing\\npopulations of cells: time-points can be processed in parallel (making it\\neasier to collect more time-points). However, then the time of collection is\\nunknown, and must be recovered by solving a seriation problem (or\\none-dimensional manifold learning problem).\\n  We propose an estimator based on Wasserstein principal curves, and prove it\\nis consistent for recovering a curve of probability measures in Wasserstein\\nspace from empirical samples. This consistency theorem is obtained via a series\\nof results regarding principal curves in compact metric spaces. In particular,\\nwe establish the validity of certain numerical discretization schemes for\\nprincipal curves, which is a new result even in the Euclidean setting.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T06:44:34Z\"}"}
