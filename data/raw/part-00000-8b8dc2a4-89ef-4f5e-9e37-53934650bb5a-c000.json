Determining the posterior distribution\\nis also known as Bayesian inference. This paper equips a quantum while-language\\nwith conditioning, defines its denotational and operational semantics over\\ninfinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, and shows their equivalence. We provide\\nsufficient conditions for the existence of weakest (liberal)\\nprecondition-transformers and derive inductive characterizations of these\\ntransformers. It is shown how w(l)p-transformers can be used to assess the\\neffect of Bayesian inference on (possibly diverging) quantum programs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LO\", \"categories\": \"cs.LO,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:15:54Z\"}"}
