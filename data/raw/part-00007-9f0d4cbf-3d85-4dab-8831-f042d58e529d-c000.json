Various\\nsolutions exist, including pitot tubes, angular vanes, and multihole pressure\\nprobes. However, current sensors are either too heavy (>30 g) or require large\\nairspeeds (>20 m/s), making them unsuitable for small uncrewed aerial vehicles.\\nWe propose a novel multihole pressure probe, integrating sensing electronics in\\na single-component structure, resulting in a mechanically robust and\\nlightweight sensor (9 g), which we released to the public domain. Since there\\nis no consensus on two critical design parameters, tip shape (conical vs\\nspherical) and hole spacing (distance between holes), we provide a study on\\nmeasurement accuracy and noise generation using wind tunnel experiments. The\\nsensor is calibrated using a multivariate polynomial regression model over an\\nairspeed range of 3-27 m/s and an angle of attack/sideslip range of +-35{\\\\deg},\\nachieving a mean absolute error of 0.44 m/s and 0.16{\\\\deg}. Finally, we\\nvalidated the sensor in outdoor flights near the stall regime. Our probe\\nenabled accurate estimations of airspeed, angle of attack and sideslip during\\ndifferent acrobatic manoeuvres. Due to its size and weight, this sensor will\\nenable safe flight for lightweight, uncrewed aerial vehicles flying at low\\nspeeds close to the stall regime.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T09:04:49Z\"}"}
