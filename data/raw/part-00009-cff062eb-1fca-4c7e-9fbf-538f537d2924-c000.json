Advancing these applications is generally limited\\nby finding materials that simultaneously provide lifetime-limited optical and\\nlong spin coherences. Here, we introduce $^{171}$Yb$^{3+}$ ions doped into a\\nCaWO$_4$ crystal. We perform high-resolution spectroscopy of the excited state,\\nand demonstrate all-optical coherent control of the electron-nuclear spin\\nensemble. We find narrow inhomogeneous broadening of the optical transitions of\\n185 MHz and radiative-lifetime-limited coherence time up to 0.75 ms. Next to\\nthis, we measure a spin-transition ensemble line width of 5 kHz and\\nelectron-nuclear spin coherence time reaching 0.15 seconds at zero magnetic\\nfield between 50 mK and 1 K temperatures. These results demonstrate the\\npotential of $^{171}$Yb$^{3+}$:CaWO$_4$ as a low-noise platform for building\\nquantum technologies with ensemble-based memories, microwave-to-optical\\ntransducers, and optically addressable single-ion spin qubits.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T10:57:01Z\"}"}
