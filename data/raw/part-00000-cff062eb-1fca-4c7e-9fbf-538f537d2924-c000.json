{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01583v1\", \"title\": \"LL-Localizer: A Life-Long Localization System based on Dynamic i-Octree\", \"summary\": \"This paper proposes an incremental voxel-based life-long localization method,\\nLL-Localizer, which enables robots to localize robustly and accurately in\\nmulti-session mode using prior maps. Meanwhile, considering that it is\\ndifficult to be aware of changes in the environment in the prior map and robots\\nmay traverse between mapped and unmapped areas during actual operation, we will\\nupdate the map when needed according to the established strategies through\\nincremental voxel map. Besides, to ensure high performance in real-time and\\nfacilitate our map management, we utilize Dynamic i-Octree, an efficient\\norganization of 3D points based on Dynamic Octree to load local map and update\\nthe map during the robot's operation. The experiments show that our system can\\nperform stable and accurate localization comparable to state-of-the-art LIO\\nsystems. And even if the environment in the prior map changes or the robots\\ntraverse between mapped and unmapped areas, our system can still maintain\\nrobust and accurate localization without any distinction. Our demo can be found\\non Blibili (https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1faZHYCEkZ) and youtube\\n(https://youtu.be/UWn7RCb9kA8) and the program will be available at\\nhttps://github.com/M-Evanovic/LL-Localizer.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T10:39:23Z\"}"}
