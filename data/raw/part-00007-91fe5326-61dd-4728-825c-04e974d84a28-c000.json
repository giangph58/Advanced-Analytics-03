BrAIcht is fine-tuned using German LeoLM, a large language model with 7\\nbillion parameters and a modified version of the base Llama2 suitable for\\nGerman language tasks. For fine-tuning, 29 plays of Bertolt Brecht and 907 of\\nother German plays that are stylistically similar to Bertolt Brecht are used to\\nform a more di-erse dataset. Due to the limited memory capacity, a\\nparameterefficient fine-tuning technique called QLoRA is implemented to train\\nthe large language model. The results, based on BLEU score and perplexity, show\\nvery promising performance of BrAIcht in generating dialogues in the style of\\nBertolt Brecht.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T08:55:12Z\"}"}
