Such scattering processes and\\nresonances can be determined in lattice QCD by first obtaining the\\nfinite-volume energy spectrum of stationary states involving meson-baryon and\\nbaryon-baryon systems. A well-known quantization condition involving the\\nscattering $K$-matrix and a complicated ``box matrix'' also yields a\\nfinite-volume energy spectrum. By appropriately parametrizing the scattering\\n$K$-matrix, the best fit values of the $K$-matrix parameters are those which\\nproduce a finite-volume spectrum which best matches that obtained from lattice\\nQCD. The $\\\\Delta$ resonance, a recent study of the two-pole nature of\\nscattering near the $\\\\Lambda(1405)$, and $NN$ scattering in the $SU(3)$ flavor\\nlimit are highlighted.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-lat\", \"categories\": \"hep-lat\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T17:55:19Z\"}"}
