The adventure started\\nfrom Lyot expertise and extended progressively to the measurement of vector\\nmagnetic fields using various and improving polarimetric techniques (such as\\nbeam exchange or grid) or new spectroscopic methods (such as the MSDP imaging\\nslicer), at Meudon and Pic du Midi, ending by the achievement of the\\nstate-of-the-art optimized and polarization free telescope THEMIS in 1999.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T07:54:10Z\"}"}
