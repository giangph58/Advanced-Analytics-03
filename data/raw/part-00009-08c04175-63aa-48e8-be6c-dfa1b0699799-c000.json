{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03553v1\", \"title\": \"A Hashgraph-Inspired Consensus Mechanism for Reliable Multi-Model\\n  Reasoning\", \"summary\": \"Inconsistent outputs and hallucinations from large language models (LLMs) are\\nmajor obstacles to reliable AI systems. When different proprietary reasoning\\nmodels (RMs), such as those by OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, DeepSeek, and xAI,\\nare given the same complex request, they often produce divergent results due to\\nvariations in training and inference. This paper proposes a novel consensus\\nmechanism, inspired by distributed ledger technology, to validate and converge\\nthese outputs, treating each RM as a black-box peer. Building on the Hashgraph\\nconsensus algorithm, our approach employs gossip-about-gossip communication and\\nvirtual voting to achieve agreement among an ensemble of RMs. We present an\\narchitectural design for a prototype system in which RMs iteratively exchange\\nand update their answers, using information from each round to improve accuracy\\nand confidence in subsequent rounds. This approach goes beyond simple majority\\nvoting by incorporating the knowledge and cross-verification content of every\\nmodel. We justify the feasibility of this Hashgraph-inspired consensus for AI\\nensembles and outline its advantages over traditional ensembling techniques in\\nreducing nonfactual outputs. Preliminary considerations for implementation,\\nevaluation criteria for convergence and accuracy, and potential challenges are\\ndiscussed. The proposed mechanism demonstrates a promising direction for\\nmulti-agent AI systems to self-validate and deliver high-fidelity responses in\\ncomplex tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T14:05:12Z\"}"}
