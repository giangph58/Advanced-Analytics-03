The model\\nintroduces a fermionic DM candidate $\\\\chi$ and a scalar $\\\\phi$, both charged\\nunder an unbroken $U(1)_D$ gauge symmetry. The self-interactions of $\\\\chi$ are\\nmediated by a light vector boson $X^\\\\mu$, whose mass is generated via the\\nStueckelberg mechanism. The relic abundance of $\\\\chi$ is determined by thermal\\nfreeze-out through annihilations into $X^\\\\mu$, supplemented by a non-thermal\\ncomponent from the late decay of $\\\\phi$. Crucially, $\\\\phi$ decays after the Big\\nBang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) but before the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\\nepoch, producing additional $\\\\chi$ and a dark radiation species ($\\\\nu_S$). This\\nlate-time production compensates for thermal underabundance due to efficient\\nannihilation into light mediators, while remaining consistent with structure\\nformation constraints. The accompanying dark radiation yields a detectable\\n$\\\\Delta N_{\\\\rm eff}$, compatible with Planck 2018 bounds and within reach of\\nnext-generation experiments such as SPT-3G, CMB-S4, and CMB-HD.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T17:37:57Z\"}"}
