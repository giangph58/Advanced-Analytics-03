The proposed Potts machine\\nis able to\\n  solve a certain class of combinatorial optimization prob lems that natively\\nrequire multivalued spins with a divide and-conquer approach, facilitated\\nthrough the alternating\\n  phase-shifted SHILs acting on the oscillators. The pro posed architecture\\neliminates the need for any external in termediary mappings or usage of\\nexternal memory, as the\\n  influence of SHIL allows oscillators to act as both mem ory and computation\\nunits. Planar 4-coloring problems\\n  of sizes up to 2116 nodes are mapped to the proposed\\n  architecture. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed\\n  Potts machine provides exact solutions for smaller prob lems (e.g. 49 nodes)\\nand generates solutions reaching up\\n  to 97% accuracy for larger problems (e.g. 2116 nodes).\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AR\", \"categories\": \"cs.AR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:47:34Z\"}"}
