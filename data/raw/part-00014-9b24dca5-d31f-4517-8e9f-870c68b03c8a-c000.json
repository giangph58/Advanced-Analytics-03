{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03173v1\", \"title\": \"RAVU: Retrieval Augmented Video Understanding with Compositional\\n  Reasoning over Graph\", \"summary\": \"Comprehending long videos remains a significant challenge for Large\\nMulti-modal Models (LMMs). Current LMMs struggle to process even minutes to\\nhours videos due to their lack of explicit memory and retrieval mechanisms. To\\naddress this limitation, we propose RAVU (Retrieval Augmented Video\\nUnderstanding), a novel framework for video understanding enhanced by retrieval\\nwith compositional reasoning over a spatio-temporal graph. We construct a graph\\nrepresentation of the video, capturing both spatial and temporal relationships\\nbetween entities. This graph serves as a long-term memory, allowing us to track\\nobjects and their actions across time. To answer complex queries, we decompose\\nthe queries into a sequence of reasoning steps and execute these steps on the\\ngraph, retrieving relevant key information. Our approach enables more accurate\\nunderstanding of long videos, particularly for queries that require multi-hop\\nreasoning and tracking objects across frames. Our approach demonstrate superior\\nperformances with limited retrieved frames (5-10) compared with other SOTA\\nmethods and baselines on two major video QA datasets, NExT-QA and EgoSchema.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T04:38:09Z\"}"}
