Significant progresses have been made in\\nextending the distribution distance of entangled photons, either in free space\\nor fiber. For future quantum network applications, matter-based entanglement is\\nmore favorable since the capability of storage is essential for advanced\\napplications. Extending entanglement distance for memory qubits was partially\\nhindered by the mismatch of its photonic emission wavelength with the low-loss\\ntransmission window of optical fiber. By incorporating quantum frequency\\nconversion, memory-memory entanglement has been successfully extended to\\nseveral tens of kilometers. Here, we make a significant step further by\\nreporting the entanglement between two atomic ensemble quantum memories over\\n420 km. We convert photons emitted from the memories to telecom S-band, which\\nenable us to exploit the significantly low transmission loss in fiber (0.17\\ndB/km). We employ the DLCZ scheme for remote entanglement generation, and\\ndelicately stabilize the relative phase between the two memories by using\\nfulltime far-off-resonant locking to reduce high-frequency noise and\\nintermittent dual-band locking to compensate low-frequency drift jointly. We\\ndemonstrate that the memory-memory entangling probability beats the\\nrepeaterless channel capacity for direct entanglement distribution. Our\\nexperiment provides a testbed of studying quantum network applications from\\nmetropolitan scale to intercity scale.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T04:19:24Z\"}"}
