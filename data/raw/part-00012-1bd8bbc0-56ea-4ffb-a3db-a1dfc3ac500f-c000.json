With the prevalence of AI, researchers\\nhave identified numerous use cases of AI in network security. However, there\\nare almost nonexistent studies that analyze the suitability of Large Language\\nModels (LLMs) in network security. To fill this gap, we examine the suitability\\nof LLMs in network security, particularly with the case study of STRIDE threat\\nmodeling. We utilize four prompting techniques with five LLMs to perform STRIDE\\nclassification of 5G threats. From our evaluation results, we point out key\\nfindings and detailed insights along with the explanation of the possible\\nunderlying factors influencing the behavior of LLMs in the modeling of certain\\nthreats. The numerical results and the insights support the necessity for\\nadjusting and fine-tuning LLMs for network security use cases.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.AI,cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T03:37:49Z\"}"}
