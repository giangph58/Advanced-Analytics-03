{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24091v1\", \"title\": \"4D mmWave Radar in Adverse Environments for Autonomous Driving: A Survey\", \"summary\": \"Autonomous driving systems require accurate and reliable perception. However,\\nadverse environments, such as rain, snow, and fog, can significantly degrade\\nthe performance of LiDAR and cameras. In contrast, 4D millimeter-wave (mmWave)\\nradar not only provides 3D sensing and additional velocity measurements but\\nalso maintains robustness in challenging conditions, making it increasingly\\nvaluable for autonomous driving. Recently, research on 4D mmWave radar under\\nadverse environments has been growing, but a comprehensive survey is still\\nlacking. To bridge this gap, this survey comprehensively reviews the current\\nresearch on 4D mmWave radar under adverse environments. First, we present an\\noverview of existing 4D mmWave radar datasets encompassing diverse weather and\\nlighting scenarios. Next, we analyze methods and models according to different\\nadverse conditions. Finally, the challenges faced in current studies and\\npotential future directions are discussed for advancing 4D mmWave radar\\napplications in harsh environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\\nfirst survey specifically focusing on 4D mmWave radar in adverse environments\\nfor autonomous driving.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:42:50Z\"}"}
