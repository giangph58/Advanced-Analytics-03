Our Optic\\nFingerprint (OFP) model utilizes inherent LED nonlinearities to generate\\namplitude-based feature vectors in time and frequency domains, specifically\\ndesigned for optical wireless systems. Experimental results with 39 commercial\\nLEDs demonstrate 90.36% classification accuracy across SNR 10-30 dB while\\nmaintaining standard compliance, offering a practical physical-layer\\nauthentication solution for visible light communication.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T14:01:02Z\"}"}
