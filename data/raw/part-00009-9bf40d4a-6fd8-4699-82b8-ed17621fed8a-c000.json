In such systems, dipolar interactions play a crucial role in\\ndetermining their physical behavior. However, due to the anisotropic and\\nlong-range nature of dipolar interactions, conventional Monte Carlo (MC)\\nmethods face challenges in investigating these systems near criticality. In\\nthis study, we examine the critical behavior of a triangular lattice of dipoles\\nusing the optimized Tomita MC algorithm tailored for dipolar interactions. We\\nemploy two independent computational approaches to estimate the critical\\ntemperature and exponents: equilibrium MC simulations with histogram\\nreweighting and the non-equilibrium relaxation method. Notably, both approaches\\ndemonstrate that the critical exponents are very close to those of the 2D Ising\\nuniversality class.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T09:36:24Z\"}"}
