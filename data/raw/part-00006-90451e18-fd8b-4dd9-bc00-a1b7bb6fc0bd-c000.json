Despite\\nthis, conventional DCS suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per single\\nacquisition due to the dynamic range limitation of photodetectors imposed by\\nthe high peak power of mode-locked pulses, necessitating coherent averaging.\\nConsequently, averaging numerous interferograms compromises both the\\nexceptional time resolution and places greater demands on long-term mutual\\ncoherence and stability. In this study, we demonstrate a novel approach to\\nenhance SNR by exploiting the spectral mode enhancement mechanism in\\ncoherent-harmonic pulses. As a proof-of-concept, we employ two frequency combs\\nwith mode spacing of $\\\\sim$12.5 MHz, operating at a 20th harmonic repetition\\nrate of $\\\\sim$250 MHz. The result demonstrates a $>$300-fold reduction in\\naveraging time while achieving comparable SNR in conventional DCS. This\\nreduction is expected to be further enhancement through integration with\\nultra-high repetition rate combs, such as microresonator combs. This approach\\npromises both a recovery of the inherent high-speed capability and a mitigation\\nof the coherence-time requirements, thereby making it possible to significantly\\nfacilitate subsequent DCS investigations, as well as field-deployed\\nimplementations.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:16:08Z\"}"}
