These dynamics are\\ntypically studied in hundreds-of-meter-long wave flumes. Here, we demonstrate a\\nchip-scale, quantum-enabled wave flume. The wave flume exploits nanometer-thick\\nsuperfluid helium films and optomechanical interactions to achieve\\nnonlinearities surpassing those of extreme terrestrial flows. Measurements\\nreveal wave steepening, shock fronts, and soliton fission -- nonlinear\\nbehaviors long predicted in superfluid helium but never previously directly\\nobserved. Our approach enables lithography-defined wave flume geometries,\\noptomechanical control of hydrodynamic properties, and orders of magnitude\\nfaster measurements than terrestrial flumes. Together, this opens a new\\nfrontier in hydrodynamics, combining quantum fluids and nanophotonics to\\nexplore complex wave dynamics at microscale.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn,physics.optics,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T15:11:21Z\"}"}
