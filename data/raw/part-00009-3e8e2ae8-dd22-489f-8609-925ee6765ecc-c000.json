A key challenge in lattice formulations\\nis the proper realization of topological phases and the Chern-Simons terms,\\nwhere fermion discretization plays a crucial role. In this work, we analyze\\nstaggered and Wilson fermions coupled to $\\\\text{U}(1)$ background gauge fields\\nin the Hamiltonian formulation and demonstrate that staggered fermions fail to\\ninduce (2+1)D topological phases, while Wilson fermions admit a variety of\\ntopological phases including Chern insulator and quantum spin Hall phases. We\\nadditionally uncover a rich phase diagram for the two-flavor Wilson fermion\\nmodel in the presence of a chemical potential. Our findings resolve existing\\nambiguities in Hamiltonian formulations and provide a theoretical foundation\\nfor future quantum simulations of gauge theories with topological phases. We\\nfurther outline connections to experimental platforms, offering guidance for\\nimplementations on near-term quantum computing architectures.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-lat\", \"categories\": \"hep-lat,hep-th,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:33:01Z\"}"}
