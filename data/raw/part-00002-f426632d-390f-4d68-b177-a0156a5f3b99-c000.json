Most\\nexisting approaches solely focus on identifying a subgroup with an improved\\ntreatment effect. However, practical considerations, such as ensuring a minimum\\nsubgroup size for representativeness or achieving sufficient confounder balance\\nfor reliability, are also important for making findings clinically meaningful\\nand actionable. While some studies address these constraints individually, none\\noffer a unified approach to handle them simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we\\npropose a model-agnostic framework for optimal subgroup identification under\\nmultiple constraints. We reformulate this combinatorial problem as an\\nunconstrained min-max optimization problem with novel modifications and solve\\nit by a gradient descent ascent algorithm. We further prove its convergence to\\na feasible and locally optimal solution. Our method is stable and highly\\nflexible, supporting various models and techniques for estimating and\\noptimizing treatment effectiveness with observational data. Extensive\\nexperiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate its\\neffectiveness in identifying subgroups that satisfy multiple constraints,\\nachieving higher treatment effects and better confounder balancing results\\nacross different group sizes.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T16:25:23Z\"}"}
