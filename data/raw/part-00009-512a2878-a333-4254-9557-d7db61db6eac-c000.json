This chapter\\nfocuses on the developmental window from prenatal period to infancy, probably\\nthe most dynamic period across the entire lifespan. The availability of\\nnon-invasive three-dimensional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) methodologies\\nhas changed the paradigm and allows investigations of the living human brain\\nstructure - e.g. micro- and macrostructural features of cortical and\\nsubcortical regions and their connections, including cortical\\nsulcation/gyrification, area, and thickness, as well as white matter\\nmicrostructure and connectivity - beginning in utero. Because of its relative\\nsafety, MRI is well-adapted to study individuals at multiple time points and to\\nlongitudinally follow the changes in brain structure and function that underlie\\nthe early stages of cognitive development.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.NC\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.NC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T08:05:02Z\"}"}
