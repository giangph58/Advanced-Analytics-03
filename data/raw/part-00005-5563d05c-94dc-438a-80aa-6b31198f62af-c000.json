In the field of sound\\neffects (SFX) generation, LLMs have been leveraged to orchestrate multiple\\nmodels for audio synthesis. However, due to the scarcity of annotated datasets,\\nand the complexity of temproal modeling. current SFX generation techniques\\nstill fall short in achieving high-fidelity audio. To address these\\nlimitations, this paper introduces a novel framework that integrates LLMs with\\nexisting sound effect databases, allowing for the retrieval, recombination, and\\nsynthesis of audio based on user requirements. By leveraging this approach, we\\nenhance the diversity and quality of generated sound effects while eliminating\\nthe need for additional recording costs, offering a flexible and efficient\\nsolution for sound design and application.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SD\", \"categories\": \"cs.SD,eess.AS\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T07:15:04Z\"}"}
