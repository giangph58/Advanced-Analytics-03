We tested a\\ncylindrical sample with dimensions of 2x2 inches. The study includes\\nmeasurements of neutron-gamma discrimination capability, emission spectra,\\nphotoelectron yield, and the analysis of light pulse shapes originating from\\nevents related to gamma-rays and fast neutrons. The results were compared to\\ndata previously recorded using a pure Organic Glass Scintillator (BSO-100), an\\nEJ-309 liquid scintillator, and EJ-276 and M600 polyurethane-based plastic\\nscintillators.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T10:19:05Z\"}"}
