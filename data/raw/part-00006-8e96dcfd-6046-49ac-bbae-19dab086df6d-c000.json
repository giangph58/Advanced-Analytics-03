A natural estimator for the TMES is proposed, and its asymptotic\\nproperties are studied. To address challenges in constructing confidence\\nintervals for the TMES in practice, we apply the stationary bootstrap method to\\ngenerate confidence bands for the TMES estimator. Extensive simulation studies\\nwere conducted to investigate the asymptotic properties of empirical and\\nbootstrapped TMES. Two practical applications of TMES, supported by real data\\nanalyses, effectively demonstrate its ability to account for time lags in risk\\nassessment.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:47:56Z\"}"}
