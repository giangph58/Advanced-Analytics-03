{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12800v1\", \"title\": \"CAGE-GS: High-fidelity Cage Based 3D Gaussian Splatting Deformation\", \"summary\": \"As 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) gains popularity as a 3D representation of\\nreal scenes, enabling user-friendly deformation to create novel scenes while\\npreserving fine details from the original 3DGS has attracted significant\\nresearch attention. We introduce CAGE-GS, a cage-based 3DGS deformation method\\nthat seamlessly aligns a source 3DGS scene with a user-defined target shape.\\nOur approach learns a deformation cage from the target, which guides the\\ngeometric transformation of the source scene. While the cages effectively\\ncontrol structural alignment, preserving the textural appearance of 3DGS\\nremains challenging due to the complexity of covariance parameters. To address\\nthis, we employ a Jacobian matrix-based strategy to update the covariance\\nparameters of each Gaussian, ensuring texture fidelity post-deformation. Our\\nmethod is highly flexible, accommodating various target shape representations,\\nincluding texts, images, point clouds, meshes and 3DGS models. Extensive\\nexperiments and ablation studies on both public datasets and newly proposed\\nscenes demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing\\ntechniques in both efficiency and deformation quality.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GR\", \"categories\": \"cs.GR,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T10:00:15Z\"}"}
