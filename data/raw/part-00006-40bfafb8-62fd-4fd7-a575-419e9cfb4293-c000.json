The number of components of $G$ is\\ndenoted by $c(G)$. Let $t$ be a positive real number, and a connected graph $G$\\nis $t$-tough if $t c(G-S)\\\\leq|S|$ for every vertex cut $S$ of $V(G)$. The\\ntoughness of graph $G$, denoted by $\\\\tau(G)$, is the largest value of $t$ for\\nwhich $G$ is $t$-tough. Recently, Fan, Lin and Lu [European J. Combin.\\n110(2023), 103701] presented sufficient conditions based on the spectral radius\\nfor graphs to be 1-tough with minimum degree $\\\\delta(G)$ and graphs to be\\n$t$-tough with $t\\\\geq 1$ being an integer, respectively. In this paper, we\\nestablish sufficient conditions in terms of the distance signless Laplacian\\nspectral radius for graphs to be 1-tough with minimum degree $\\\\delta(G)$ and\\ngraphs to be $t$-tough, where $\\\\frac{1}{t}$ is a positive integer. Moreover, we\\nconsider the relationship between the distance signless Laplacian spectral\\nradius and $t$-tough graphs in terms of the order $n$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T07:01:52Z\"}"}
