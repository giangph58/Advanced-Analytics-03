Among the various\\nphenomena in active matter that have no analogue in equilibrium systems,\\nmotility-induced phase separation (MIPS) in active colloidal suspensions is one\\nof the most extensively studied. However, the mechanical properties of this\\nfundamental active state of matter remain poorly understood. This study\\ninvestigates the rheology of a suspension of active colloidal particles under\\nconstant and oscillatory shear. Systems consisting of pseudo-hard active\\nBrownian particles exhibiting co-existence of dense and dilute phases behave as\\na viscoelastic Maxwell fluid at low and high frequencies, displaying\\nexclusively shear thinning across a wide range of densities and activities.\\nRemarkably, the cross-over point between the storage and loss moduli is\\nnon-monotonic, rising with activity before the MIPS transition but falling with\\nactivity after the transition, revealing the subtleties of how active forces\\nand intrinsically out-of-equilibrium phases affect the mechanical properties of\\nthese systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T15:40:17Z\"}"}
