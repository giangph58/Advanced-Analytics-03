{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04534v1\", \"title\": \"PANCAKE: Python bAsed Numerical Color-magnitude-diagram Analysis pacKagE\", \"summary\": \"Stellar populations serve as a fossil record of galaxy formation and\\nevolution, providing crucial information about the history of star formation\\nand galaxy evolution. The color-magnitude diagram (CMD) stands out as the most\\naccurate tool currently available for inferring the star formation histories\\n(SFHs) of nearby galaxies with stellar-resolved multiband data. The launch of\\nnew space telescopes, including JWST, EUCLID, and the upcoming CSST and Roman,\\nwill significantly increase the number of stellar-resolved galaxies over the\\nnext decade. A user-friendly and customizable CMD fitting package would be\\nvaluable for galaxy evolution studies with these data. We develop an\\nopen-source Python-based package named \\\\textsc{pancake}, which is fast and\\naccurate in determining SFHs and stellar population parameters in nearby\\ngalaxies. We have validated our method via a series of comprehensive tests.\\nFirst, \\\\textsc{pancake} performs well on mock data, meanwhile the random and\\nsystematic uncertainties are quantified. Second, \\\\textsc{pancake} performs well\\non observational data containing a star cluster and 38 dwarf galaxies (50\\nfields). Third, the star formation rate (SFR) from \\\\textsc{pancake} is\\nconsistent with the SFR from FUV photometry. To ensure compatibility and\\naccuracy, we have included isochrone libraries generated using PARSEC for most\\nof the optical and near-infrared filters used in space telescopes such as HST,\\nJWST, and the upcoming CSST.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T16:09:22Z\"}"}
