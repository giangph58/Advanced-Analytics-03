{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12165v1\", \"title\": \"CodingHomo: Bootstrapping Deep Homography With Video Coding\", \"summary\": \"Homography estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision with\\napplications in diverse fields. Recent advances in deep learning have improved\\nhomography estimation, particularly with unsupervised learning approaches,\\noffering increased robustness and generalizability. However, accurately\\npredicting homography, especially in complex motions, remains a challenge. In\\nresponse, this work introduces a novel method leveraging video coding,\\nparticularly by harnessing inherent motion vectors (MVs) present in videos. We\\npresent CodingHomo, an unsupervised framework for homography estimation. Our\\nframework features a Mask-Guided Fusion (MGF) module that identifies and\\nutilizes beneficial features among the MVs, thereby enhancing the accuracy of\\nhomography prediction. Additionally, the Mask-Guided Homography Estimation\\n(MGHE) module is presented for eliminating undesired features in the\\ncoarse-to-fine homography refinement process. CodingHomo outperforms existing\\nstate-of-the-art unsupervised methods, delivering good robustness and\\ngeneralizability.
