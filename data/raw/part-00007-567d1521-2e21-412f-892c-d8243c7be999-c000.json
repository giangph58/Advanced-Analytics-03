We develop a coupled-mode\\ntheory approach which account for the frequency shift due to a temperature\\ndependent dielectric permittivity. The model is applied to rectangular and\\nhexagonal resonators supporting an isolated high-quality resonant mode. The\\nresults are verified in comparison with straightforward finite-element\\nsimulations. It is shown that the model accurately describes the effect\\nbistabily which occurs under variation of the angle of incidence or the\\nintensity of the incident wave. In particular, it is demonstrated that\\nvariation of the incident angle can optimize the coupling between the resonator\\nand the incident waves leading to bistabily with low intensity incident waves\\n$W_0 = 0.35 {\\\\rm \\\\mu W/\\\\mu m}^2$. The bistability threshold is shown to be\\nextremely sensitive to the imaginary part of the dielectric permittivity\\n$\\\\epsilon''$.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T10:16:28Z\"}"}
