{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17614v1\", \"title\": \"Bolt: Clothing Virtual Characters at Scale\", \"summary\": \"Clothing virtual characters is a time-consuming and often manual process.\\nOutfits can be composed of multiple garments, and each garment must be fitted\\nto the unique shape of a character. Since characters can vary widely in size\\nand shape, fitting outfits to many characters is a combinatorially large\\nproblem. We present Bolt, a system designed to take outfits originally authored\\non a source body and fit them to new body shapes via a three stage transfer,\\ndrape, and rig process. First, our new garment transfer method transforms each\\ngarment's 3D mesh positions to the new character, then optimizes the garment's\\n2D sewing pattern while maintaining key features of the original seams and\\nboundaries. Second, our system simulates the transferred garments to\\nprogressively drape and untangle each garment in the outfit. Finally, the\\ngarments are rigged to the new character. This entire process is automatic,\\nmaking it feasible to clothe characters at scale with no human intervention.\\nClothed characters are then ready for immediate use in applications such as\\ngaming, animation, synthetic generation, and more.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GR\", \"categories\": \"cs.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:38:09Z\"}"}
