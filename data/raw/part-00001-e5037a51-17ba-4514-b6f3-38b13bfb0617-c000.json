Given\\nmulti-valued mapping $F: D\\\\times K\\\\rightrightarrows Y$, can be formulated as\\nthe problem, find $\\\\bar x\\\\in D$ such that $$\\\\mbox{GVEP}(F, D,\\nK)\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\theta\\\\in F(\\\\bar x, y)\\\\ \\\\mbox{for all}\\\\ y\\\\in K.$$ We prove\\nseveral existence theorems for solutions to the generalized vector equilibrium\\nproblem when $K$ is an arbitrary nonempty set without any algebraic or\\ntopological structure. Furthermore, we establish that some sufficient\\nconditions ensuring the existence of a solution for the considered conditions\\nare imposed not on the entire domain of the bifunctions but rather on a\\nself-segment-dense subset. We apply the obtained results to variational\\nrelation problems, vector equilibrium problems, and common fixed point\\nproblems.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T08:21:50Z\"}"}
