{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04969v1\", \"title\": \"General Transform: A Unified Framework for Adaptive Transform to Enhance\\n  Representations\", \"summary\": \"Discrete transforms, such as the discrete Fourier transform, are widely used\\nin machine learning to improve model performance by extracting meaningful\\nfeatures. However, with numerous transforms available, selecting an appropriate\\none often depends on understanding the dataset's properties, making the\\napproach less effective when such knowledge is unavailable. In this work, we\\npropose General Transform (GT), an adaptive transform-based representation\\ndesigned for machine learning applications. Unlike conventional transforms, GT\\nlearns data-driven mapping tailored to the dataset and task of interest. Here,\\nwe demonstrate that models incorporating GT outperform conventional\\ntransform-based approaches across computer vision and natural language\\nprocessing tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in diverse learning scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.CL,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T06:01:11Z\"}"}
