{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16873v1\", \"title\": \"A LOFAR-style reconstruction of cosmic-ray air showers with SKA-Low\", \"summary\": \"Cosmic-ray air shower detection with the low-frequency part of the Square\\nKilometre Array (SKA) radio telescope is envisioned to yield very high\\nprecision measurements of the particle composition of cosmic rays between\\n$10^{16}$ and $10^{18}$ eV. This is made possible by the extreme antenna\\ndensity of the core of SKA-Low, surpassing the current most dense radio air\\nshower observatory LOFAR by over an order of magnitude. In order to make these\\nmeasurements, the technical implementation of this observation mode and the\\ndevelopment of reconstruction methods have to happen hand-in-hand. As a first\\nlower limit of what is obtainable, we apply the current most precise\\nreconstruction methods as used at LOFAR to a first complete simulation of air\\nshower signals for the SKA-Low array. We describe this simulation setup and\\ndiscuss the obtainable accuracy and resolution. A special focus is put on\\neffects of the dynamic range of the system, beamforming methods to lower the\\nenergy threshold, as well as the limits to the mass composition accuracy given\\nby statistical and systematic uncertainties.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T16:47:18Z\"}"}
