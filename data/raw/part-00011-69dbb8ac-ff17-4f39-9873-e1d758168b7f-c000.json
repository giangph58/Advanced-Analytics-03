{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16076v1\", \"title\": \"Optimal intrinsic alignment estimators in the presence of redshift-space\\n  distortions\", \"summary\": \"We present estimators for quantifying intrinsic alignments in large\\nspectroscopic surveys that efficiently capture line-of-sight (LOS) information\\nwhile being relatively insensitive to redshift-space distortions (RSD). We\\ndemonstrate that changing the LOS integration range, {\\\\Pi}max, as a function of\\ntransverse separation outperforms the conventional choice of a single {\\\\Pi}max\\nvalue. This is further improved by replacing the flat {\\\\Pi}max cut with a LOS\\nweighting based on shape projection and RSD. Although these estimators\\nincorporate additional LOS information, they are projected correlations that\\nexhibit signal-to-noise ratios comparable to 3D correlation functions, such as\\nthe IA quadrupole. Using simulations from Abacus Summit, we evaluate these\\nestimators and provide recommended {\\\\Pi}max values and weights for projected\\nseparations of 1 - 100 Mpc/h. These will improve measurements of intrinsic\\nalignments in large cosmological surveys and the constraints they provide for\\nboth weak lensing and direct cosmological applications.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T17:55:52Z\"}"}
