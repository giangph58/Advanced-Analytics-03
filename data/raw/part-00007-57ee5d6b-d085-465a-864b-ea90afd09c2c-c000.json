{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07703v1\", \"title\": \"Optimal Frequency Support from Virtual Power Plants: Minimal Reserve and\\n  Allocation\", \"summary\": \"This paper proposes a novel reserve-minimizing and allocation strategy for\\nvirtual power plants (VPPs) to deliver optimal frequency support. The proposed\\nstrategy enables VPPs, acting as aggregators for inverter-based resources\\n(IBRs), to provide optimal frequency support economically. The proposed\\nstrategy captures time-varying active power injections, reducing the\\nunnecessary redundancy compared to traditional fixed reserve schemes. Reserve\\nrequirements for the VPPs are determined based on system frequency response and\\nsafety constraints, ensuring efficient grid support. Furthermore, an\\nenergy-based allocation model decomposes power injections for each IBR,\\naccounting for their specific limitations. Numerical experiments validate the\\nfeasibility of the proposed approach, highlighting significant financial gains\\nfor VPPs, especially as system inertia decreases due to higher renewable energy\\nintegration.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T12:43:38Z\"}"}
