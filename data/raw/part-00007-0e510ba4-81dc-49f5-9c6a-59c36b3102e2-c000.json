{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03232v1\", \"title\": \"Collective decisions under uncertainty: efficiency, ex-ante fairness,\\n  and normalization\", \"summary\": \"This paper studies preference aggregation under uncertainty in the\\nmulti-profile framework introduced by Sprumont (2018, 2019) and characterizes a\\nnew class of aggregation rules that can address classical concerns about\\nHarsanyi's (1955) utilitarian rules. Our class of aggregation rules, which we\\ncall relative fair aggregation rules, is grounded in three key ideas:\\nutilitarianism, egalitarianism, and the 0--1 normalization. These rules are\\nparameterized by a set of weights over individuals. Each ambiguous alternative\\nis evaluated by computing the minimum weighted sum of the 0--1 normalized\\nutility levels within that weight set. For the characterization, we propose two\\nnovel key axioms -- weak preference for mixing and restricted certainty\\nindependence -- developed using a new method of objectively randomizing\\noutcomes even within the fully uncertain Savagean framework. Furthermore, we\\nshow that relative utilitarian aggregation rules can be identified from the\\nabove class by imposing an axiom stronger than restricted certainty\\nindependence, and that the Rawlsian maximin version can be derived by\\nconsidering strong preference for mixing instead.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.TH\", \"categories\": \"econ.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T06:53:21Z\"}"}
