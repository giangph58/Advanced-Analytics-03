{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16629v1\", \"title\": \"Finite-strain constitutive model for shape memory alloys formulated in\\n  the logarithmic strain space\", \"summary\": \"This work presents a finite-strain version of an established\\nthree-dimensional constitutive model for polycrystalline shape memory alloys\\n(SMA) that is able to account for the large deformations and rotations that SMA\\ncomponents may undergo. The model is constructed by applying the logarithmic\\nstrain space approach to the original small-strain model, which was formulated\\nwithin the Generalized Standard Materials framework and features a refined\\ndissipation (rate) function. Additionally, the free energy function is\\naugmented to be more versatile in capturing the transformation kinetics. The\\nmodel is implemented into finite element software. To demonstrate the model\\nperformance and validate the implementation, material parameters are fitted to\\nthe experimental data of two SMA, and two computational simulations of SMA\\ncomponents are conducted. The applied approach is highly flexible from the\\nperspective of the future incorporation of other phenomena, e.g.,\\nirreversibility associated with plasticity, into the model.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T11:39:23Z\"}"}
