The paper establishes that the approximation order to a\\nfunction using these modified operators is atleast as good as that achieved by\\nclassical methods by using some graphs. The analysis focuses on these series\\nwithin the context of Orlicz space \\\\( L^{\\\\eta}(\\\\mathbb{R}) \\\\), specifically\\nlooking at irregularly spaced samples. This is crucial for real-world\\napplications, especially in fields like signal processing and computational\\nmathematics, where samples are often not uniformly spaced. The paper also\\nestablishes a result on modular convergence for functions \\\\( g \\\\in\\nL^{\\\\eta}(\\\\mathbb{R}) \\\\), which includes specific cases like convergence in \\\\(\\nL^{p}(\\\\mathbb{R}) \\\\)-spaces, \\\\( L \\\\log L \\\\)-spaces, and exponential spaces. The\\nstudy then explores practical applications of the modified sampling series,\\nnotably for discontinuous functions and provides graphs to illustrate the\\nresults.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T17:15:44Z\"}"}
