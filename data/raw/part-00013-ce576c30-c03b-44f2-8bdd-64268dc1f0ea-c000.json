It is well known that the\\nrightmost particle is located near $ m_t = \\\\sqrt{2} t - \\\\frac{3}{2\\\\sqrt{2}}\\n\\\\log t $. Let $N(t,x) $ be the number of particles within distance $ x $ from $\\nm_t $, where $ x = o(t/\\\\log(t)) $ grows with $ t $. We prove that $\\nN(t,x)/\\\\pi^{-1/2}xe^{\\\\sqrt{2}x} e^{-x^2/(2t)} $ converges in probability to\\n$Z_\\\\infty$ and note that, for $ x \\\\leq t^{1/3} $, the convergence cannot be\\nstrengthened to an almost sure result. Moreover, the intermediate steps in our\\nproof provide a path localisation for the trajectories of particles in $ N(t,x)\\n$ and their genealogy, allowing us to develop a picture of the BBM front at\\nsublinear distances from $ m_t $.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:58:11Z\"}"}
