{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05281v1\", \"title\": \"Metallicities of 20 Million Giant Stars Based on Gaia XP spectra\", \"summary\": \"We design an uncertainty-aware cost-sensitive neural network (UA-CSNet) to\\nestimate metallicities from dereddened and corrected Gaia BP/RP (XP) spectra\\nfor giant stars. This method accounts for both stochastic errors in the input\\nspectra and the imbalanced density distribution in [Fe/H] values. With a\\nspecialized architecture and training strategy, the UA-CSNet improves the\\nprecision of the predicted metallicities, especially for very metal-poor (VMP;\\n$\\\\rm [Fe/H] \\\\leq -2.0$) stars. With the PASTEL catalog as the training sample,\\nour model can estimate metallicities down to $\\\\rm [Fe/H] \\\\sim -4$. We compare\\nour estimates with a number of external catalogs and conduct tests using star\\nclusters, finding overall good agreement. We also confirm that our estimates\\nfor VMP stars are unaffected by carbon enhancement. Applying the UA-CSNet, we\\nobtain reliable and precise metallicity estimates for approximately 20 million\\ngiant stars, including 360,000 VMP stars and 50,000 extremely metal-poor (EMP;\\n$\\\\rm [Fe/H] \\\\leq -3.0$) stars. The resulting catalog is publicly available at\\nhttps://doi.org/10.12149/101604. This work highlights the potential of\\nlow-resolution spectra for metallicity estimation and provides a valuable\\ndataset for studying the formation and chemo-dynamical evolution of our Galaxy.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:27:18Z\"}"}
