While Arrow is known as the \\\"zero copy format\\\", in practice, limited Linux\\nkernel support for shared memory makes it difficult to avoid copying entirely.\\nIn this work, we introduce several new techniques to eliminate nearly all\\ncopying from pipelines: in particular, we implement a new kernel module that\\nperforms de-anonymization, thus eliminating a copy to intermediate data. We\\nconclude by sharing our preliminary evaluation on different workloads types, as\\nwell as discussing our plan for future improvements.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.OS\", \"categories\": \"cs.OS,cs.DB\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T15:46:52Z\"}"}
