{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12733v1\", \"title\": \"Adversary-Augmented Simulation for Fairness Evaluation and Defense in\\n  Hyperledger Fabric\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents an adversary model and a simulation framework\\nspecifically tailored for analyzing attacks on distributed systems composed of\\nmultiple distributed protocols, with a focus on assessing the security of\\nblockchain networks. Our model classifies and constrains adversarial actions\\nbased on the assumptions of the target protocols, defined by failure models,\\ncommunication models, and the fault tolerance thresholds of Byzantine Fault\\nTolerant (BFT) protocols. The goal is to study not only the intended effects of\\nadversarial strategies but also their unintended side effects on critical\\nsystem properties. We apply this framework to analyze fairness properties in a\\nHyperledger Fabric (HF) blockchain network. Our focus is on novel fairness\\nattacks that involve coordinated adversarial actions across various HF\\nservices. Simulations show that even a constrained adversary can violate\\nfairness with respect to specific clients (client fairness) and impact related\\nguarantees (order fairness), which relate the reception order of transactions\\nto their final order in the blockchain. This paper significantly extends our\\nprevious work by introducing and evaluating a mitigation mechanism specifically\\ndesigned to counter transaction reordering attacks. We implement and integrate\\nthis defense into our simulation environment, demonstrating its effectiveness\\nunder diverse conditions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.DC,cs.MA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T08:17:27Z\"}"}
