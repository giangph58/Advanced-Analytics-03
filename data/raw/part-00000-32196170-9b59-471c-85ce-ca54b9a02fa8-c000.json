Our analysis encompasses multiple\\ndetections for the DM candidates, including collider searches at the LHC and\\nLEP, the direct detection and indirect detection. Furthermore, we also explore\\nthe possibility of a first-order EWPT in this framework. The gravitational wave\\n(GW) generated from the first-order EWPT also provides a detection method for\\nthe parameter space in the $Z_2$ symmetric GM model providing viable DM\\ncandidate. It is found that the current DM searches, especially the direct\\ndetection, provide strong constraints on the parameter space, while the GW\\nsignal can be complementary around the Higgs resonant region.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T07:17:44Z\"}"}
