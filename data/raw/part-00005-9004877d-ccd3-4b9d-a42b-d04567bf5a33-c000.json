{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21603v1\", \"title\": \"Flow Through Porous Media: A Hopf-Cole Transformation Approach for\\n  Modeling Pressure-Dependent Viscosity\", \"summary\": \"Most organic liquids exhibit a pressure-dependent viscosity, making it\\ncrucial to consider this behavior in applications where pressures significantly\\nexceed ambient conditions (e.g., geological carbon sequestration). Mathematical\\nmodels describing flow through porous media while accounting for\\nviscosity-pressure dependence are nonlinear (e.g., the Barus model). This\\nnonlinearity complicates mathematical analysis and makes numerical solutions\\nmore time-intensive and prone to convergence issues. In this paper, we\\ndemonstrate that the Hopf-Cole transformation, originally developed for\\nBurgers' equation, can recast the governing equations -- describing flow\\nthrough porous media with pressure-dependent viscosity -- into a linear form.\\nThe transformed equations, resembling Darcy's equations in the transformed\\nvariables, enable (a) systematic mathematical analysis to establish uniqueness\\nand maximum principles, (b) the derivation of a mechanics-based principle, and\\n(c) the development of efficient numerical solutions using solvers optimized\\nfor Darcy equations. Notably, many properties of the linear Darcy equations\\nnaturally extend to nonlinear models that depend on pressure. For example,\\nsolutions to these nonlinear models adhere to a reciprocal relation analogous\\nto that observed in Darcy's equations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T13:00:59Z\"}"}
