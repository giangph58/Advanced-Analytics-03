It\\nis well-known that for each field $k$, the additive equivalence classes of\\nsupport tilting $kQ$-modules correspond bijectively with the clusters of $A_Q$.\\nThe aim of this paper is to generalize this result to any ring indecomposable\\ncommutative Noetherian ring $R$, that is, the additive equivalence classes of\\n2-term silting complexes of $RQ$ correspond bijectively with the clusters of\\n$A_Q$. As an application, for a Dynkin quiver $Q$, we prove that the torsion\\nclasses of $\\\\mathrm{mod} RQ$ corresponds bijectively with the order preserving\\nmaps from $\\\\mathrm{Spec} R$ to the set of clusters.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RT\", \"categories\": \"math.RT,math.AC,math.RA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T08:04:24Z\"}"}
