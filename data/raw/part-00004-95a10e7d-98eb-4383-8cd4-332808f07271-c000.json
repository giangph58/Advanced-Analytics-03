The null geodesic approach is\\ncommonly employed to calculate light deflection within strong and weak field\\nlimits. Alternatively, several studies have explored the gravitational\\ndeflection of light using the material medium approach. For a static,\\nnon-rotating spherical mass, the deflection in a Schwarzschild field can be\\ndetermined by expressing the metric in an isotropic form and evaluating the\\nrefractive index to trace the light ray's trajectory. In this study, we extend\\nthe above-mentioned approach to the Kerr-Sen black hole spacetime in heterotic\\nstring theory, a solution representing a rotating, charged solution in\\nheterotic string theory. The frame-dragging effects inherent to the Kerr-Sen\\ngeometry are incorporated to compute the velocity of light rays, enabling the\\nderivation of the refractive index in this field. Considering the far-field\\napproximation, we calculate the deflection of light in the Kerr-Sen spacetime\\nand compare our results with those obtained for the Kerr and Schwarzschild\\nblack hole solution in GR.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T09:40:01Z\"}"}
