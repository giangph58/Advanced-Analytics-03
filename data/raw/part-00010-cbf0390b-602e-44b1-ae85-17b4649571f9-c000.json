{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05246v1\", \"title\": \"General Hamiltonian description of nonreciprocal interactions\", \"summary\": \"In a vast class of systems, which includes members as diverse as active\\ncolloids and bird flocks, interactions do not stem from a potential, and are in\\ngeneral nonreciprocal. Thus, it is not possible to define a conventional energy\\nfunction, nor to use analytical or numerical tools that rely on it. Here, we\\novercome these limitations by constructing a Hamiltonian that includes\\nauxiliary degrees of freedom; when subject to a constraint, this Hamiltonian\\nyields the original non-reciprocal dynamics. We show that Glauber dynamics\\nbased on the constrained Hamiltonian reproduces the steady states of the\\noriginal Langevin dynamics, as we explicitly illustrate for dissipative XY\\nspins with vision-cone interactions. Further, the symplectic structure inherent\\nto our construction allows us to apply the well-developed notions of\\nHamiltonian engineering, which we demonstrate by varying the amplitude of a\\nperiodic drive to tune the spin interactions between those of a square and a\\nchain lattice geometry. Overall, our framework for generic nonreciprocal\\npairwise interactions paves the way for bringing to bear the full conceptual\\nand methodological power of conventional statistical mechanics and Hamiltonian\\ndynamics to nonreciprocal systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech,cond-mat.other,cond-mat.quant-gas,cond-mat.soft,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:45:31Z\"}"}
