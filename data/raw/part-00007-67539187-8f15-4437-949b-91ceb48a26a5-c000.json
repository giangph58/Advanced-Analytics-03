The existence, uniqueness and two types of\\ncontinuity of the solution to $G$-SVIE are obtained. Moreover, combining a new\\nquasilinearization technique with the two-step approximation method, we\\nestablish the corresponding comparison theorem for a class of $G$-SVIEs. In\\nparticular, by means of this method, the classical assumptions on partial\\nderivatives of the coefficients are unnecessary.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T03:58:38Z\"}"}
