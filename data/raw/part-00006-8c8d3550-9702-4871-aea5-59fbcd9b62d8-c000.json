In this\\npaper, we propose a dual-stream neural framework designed to generate\\nsynchronized hand gestures for piano playing from audio input, addressing the\\ncritical challenge of modeling both hand independence and coordination. Our\\nframework introduces two key innovations: (i) a decoupled diffusion-based\\ngeneration framework that independently models each hand's motion via\\ndual-noise initialization, sampling distinct latent noise for each while\\nleveraging a shared positional condition, and (ii) a Hand-Coordinated\\nAsymmetric Attention (HCAA) mechanism suppresses symmetric (common-mode) noise\\nto highlight asymmetric hand-specific features, while adaptively enhancing\\ninter-hand coordination during denoising. The system operates hierarchically:\\nit first predicts 3D hand positions from audio features and then generates\\njoint angles through position-aware diffusion models, where parallel denoising\\nstreams interact via HCAA. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our\\nframework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple\\nmetrics.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SD\", \"categories\": \"cs.SD,cs.CV,eess.AS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T05:17:41Z\"}"}
