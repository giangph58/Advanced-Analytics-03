{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16736v1\", \"title\": \"A Survey of AI Agent Protocols\", \"summary\": \"The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has led to the\\nwidespread deployment of LLM agents across diverse industries, including\\ncustomer service, content generation, data analysis, and even healthcare.\\nHowever, as more LLM agents are deployed, a major issue has emerged: there is\\nno standard way for these agents to communicate with external tools or data\\nsources. This lack of standardized protocols makes it difficult for agents to\\nwork together or scale effectively, and it limits their ability to tackle\\ncomplex, real-world tasks. A unified communication protocol for LLM agents\\ncould change this. It would allow agents and tools to interact more smoothly,\\nencourage collaboration, and triggering the formation of collective\\nintelligence. In this paper, we provide a systematic overview of existing\\ncommunication protocols for LLM agents. We classify them into four main\\ncategories and make an analysis to help users and developers select the most\\nsuitable protocols for specific applications. Additionally, we conduct a\\ncomparative performance analysis of these protocols across key dimensions such\\nas security, scalability, and latency. Finally, we explore future challenges,\\nsuch as how protocols can adapt and survive in fast-evolving environments, and\\nwhat qualities future protocols might need to support the next generation of\\nLLM agent ecosystems. We expect this work to serve as a practical reference for\\nboth researchers and engineers seeking to design, evaluate, or integrate robust\\ncommunication infrastructures for intelligent agents.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T14:07:26Z\"}"}
