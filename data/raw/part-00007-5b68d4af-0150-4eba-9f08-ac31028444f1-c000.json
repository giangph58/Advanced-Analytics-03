{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04565v1\", \"title\": \"Hierarchical Task Decomposition for Execution Monitoring and Error\\n  Recovery: Understanding the Rationale Behind Task Demonstrations\", \"summary\": \"Multi-step manipulation tasks where robots interact with their environment\\nand must apply process forces based on the perceived situation remain\\nchallenging to learn and prone to execution errors. Accurately simulating these\\ntasks is also difficult. Hence, it is crucial for robust task performance to\\nlearn how to coordinate end-effector pose and applied force, monitor execution,\\nand react to deviations. To address these challenges, we propose a learning\\napproach that directly infers both low- and high-level task representations\\nfrom user demonstrations on the real system. We developed an unsupervised task\\nsegmentation algorithm that combines intention recognition and feature\\nclustering to infer the skills of a task. We leverage the inferred\\ncharacteristic features of each skill in a novel unsupervised anomaly detection\\napproach to identify deviations from the intended task execution. Together,\\nthese components form a comprehensive framework capable of incrementally\\nlearning task decisions and new behaviors as new situations arise. Compared to\\nstate-of-the-art learning techniques, our approach significantly reduces the\\nrequired amount of training data and computational complexity while efficiently\\nlearning complex in-contact behaviors and recovery strategies. Our proposed\\ntask segmentation and anomaly detection approaches outperform state-of-the-art\\nmethods on force-based tasks evaluated on two different robotic systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T16:57:51Z\"}"}
