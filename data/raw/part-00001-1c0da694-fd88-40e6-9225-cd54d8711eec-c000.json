Highly sensitive to the\\nsystem's geometry, X-ray polarization is a unique method to probe the structure\\nof X-ray binaries. The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer observed the\\nHigh-Mass X-ray Binary Cygnus X-1 and the Low-Mass X-ray Binary Swift\\nJ1727.8-1613 in different accretion states: in the hard state and in the soft\\nstate. The X-ray polarimetry analysis of both sources shows a linear\\npolarization degree increasing with energy, with higher values in the hard\\nstate than in the soft state. However, the linear polarization angle stays\\nsimilar in both states and is aligned with the radio jet within $5^\\\\circ$.\\nFurthermore, the Low-Mass X-ray Binary Swift J1727.8-1613 has a lower optical\\nintrinsic polarization and a lower X-ray polarization degree for a softer\\nspectrum. The similarities observed in this analysis between the X-ray\\npolarization results of different types of X-ray Binaries show that the\\ninnermost accretion processes are independent of the companion star's type.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T08:45:07Z\"}"}
