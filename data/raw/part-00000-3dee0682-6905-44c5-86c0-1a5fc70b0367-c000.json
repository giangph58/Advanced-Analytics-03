Current state-of-the-art time\\nintegrators used to simulate particle motion have limitations given the severe\\nnumerical stiffness of the problem and more efficient methods are of interest.\\nRecently, exponential integrators have been proposed as a promising new\\napproach for these simulations and shown to offer computational advantages over\\ncommonly used schemes. Exponential methods can solve linear problems exactly\\nand are $A$-stable. In this paper, the standard exponential algorithms\\nframework is extended to derive Nystr\\\\\\\"om-type exponential methods that\\nintegrate the Newtonian equations of motion as a second-order differential\\nequation. Specific Nystr\\\\\\\"om-type schemes of second and third orders are\\nderived and applied to strongly magnetized particle pushing problems. Numerical\\nexperiments are presented to demonstrate that the Nystr\\\\\\\"om-type exponential\\nintegrators can provide significant improvement in computational efficiency\\nover the standard exponential methods.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.comp-ph,cs.NA,math.NA,physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T04:22:49Z\"}"}
