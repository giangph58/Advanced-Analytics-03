{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16900v1\", \"title\": \"A new approach to the classification of almost contact metric manifolds\\n  via intrinsic endomorphisms\", \"summary\": \"In 1990, D. Chinea and C. Gonzalez gave a classification of almost contact\\nmetric manifolds into $2^{12}$ classes, based on the behaviour of the covariant\\nderivative $\\\\nabla^g\\\\Phi$ of the fundamental $2$-form $\\\\Phi$. This large number\\nmakes it difficult to deal with this class of manifolds. We propose a new\\napproach to almost contact metric manifolds by introducing two intrinsic\\nendomorphisms $S$ and $h$, which bear their name from the fact that they are,\\nbasically, the entities appearing in the intrinsic torsion. We present a new\\nclassification scheme for them by providing a simple flowchart based on\\nalgebraic conditions involving $S$ and $h$, which then naturally leads to a\\nregrouping of the Chinea-Gonzalez classes, and, in each step, to a further\\nrefinement, eventually ending in the single classes. This method allows a more\\nnatural exposition and derivation of both known and new results, like a new\\ncharacterization of almost contact metric manifolds admitting a characteristic\\nconnection in terms of intrinsic endomorphisms. We also describe in detail the\\nremarkable (and still very large) subclass of $\\\\mathcal{H}$-parallel almost\\ncontact manifolds, defined by the condition $(\\\\nabla^g_X\\\\Phi)(Y,Z)=0$ for all\\nhorizontal vector fields, $X,Y,Z\\\\in\\\\mathcal{H}$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T17:27:09Z\"}"}
