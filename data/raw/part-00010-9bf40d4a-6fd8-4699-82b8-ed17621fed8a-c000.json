Let $a_1(X) \\\\geq a_2(X) \\\\geq \\\\cdots \\\\geq a_m(X)$ denote the\\nmultiplicities of the $m$ distances determined by $X$ and let\\n$a(X)=\\\\left(a_1(X),\\\\dots,a_m(X)\\\\right)$. In this paper, we study several\\nquestions from Erd\\\\H{o}s's time regarding distance multiplicities. Among other\\nresults, we show that:\\n  (1) If $X$ is convex or ``not too convex'', then there exists a distance\\nother than the diameter that has multiplicity at most $n$.\\n  (2) There exists a set $X \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points, such that\\nmany distances occur with high multiplicity. In particular, at least\\n$n^{\\\\Omega(1/\\\\log\\\\log{n})}$ distances have superlinear multiplicity in $n$.\\n  (3) For any (not necessarily fixed) integer $1\\\\leq k\\\\leq\\\\log{n}$, there\\nexists $X\\\\subseteq\\\\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points, such that the difference between\\nthe $k^{\\\\text{th}}$ and $(k+1)^{\\\\text{th}}$ largest multiplicities is at least\\n$\\\\Omega(\\\\frac{n\\\\log{n}}{k})$. Moreover, the distances in $X$ with the largest\\n$k$ multiplicities can be prescribed.\\n  (4) For every $n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}$, there exists $X\\\\subseteq\\\\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$\\npoints, not all collinear or cocircular, such that $a(X)= (n-1,n-2,\\\\ldots,1)$.\\nThere also exists $Y\\\\subseteq\\\\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points with pairwise distinct\\ndistance multiplicities and $a(Y) \\\\neq (n-1,n-2,\\\\ldots,1)$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,cs.DM\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T09:37:27Z\"}"}
