Unlike existing approaches in constrained OCO, which allow\\nfor occasional safety breaches, we provide the first approach for maintaining\\nstrict safety under the assumption of gradually evolving constraints, namely\\nthe constraints change at most by a small amount between consecutive rounds.\\nThis is achieved through a primal-dual approach and Online Gradient Ascent in\\nthe dual space. We show that employing a dichotomous learning rate enables\\nensuring both safety, via zero constraint violation, and sublinear regret. Our\\nframework marks a departure from previous work by providing the first provable\\nguarantees for maintaining absolute safety in the face of changing constraints\\nin OCO.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T08:41:17Z\"}"}
