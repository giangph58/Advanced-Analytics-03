{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15229v1\", \"title\": \"Immersive Teleoperation Framework for Locomanipulation Tasks\", \"summary\": \"Recent advancements in robotic loco-manipulation have leveraged Virtual\\nReality (VR) to enhance the precision and immersiveness of teleoperation\\nsystems, significantly outperforming traditional methods reliant on 2D camera\\nfeeds and joystick controls. Despite these advancements, challenges remain,\\nparticularly concerning user experience across different setups. This paper\\nintroduces a novel VR-based teleoperation framework designed for a robotic\\nmanipulator integrated onto a mobile platform. Central to our approach is the\\napplication of Gaussian splatting, a technique that abstracts the manipulable\\nscene into a VR environment, thereby enabling more intuitive and immersive\\ninteractions. Users can navigate and manipulate within the virtual scene as if\\ninteracting with a real robot, enhancing both the engagement and efficacy of\\nteleoperation tasks. An extensive user study validates our approach,\\ndemonstrating significant usability and efficiency improvements. Two-thirds\\n(66%) of participants completed tasks faster, achieving an average time\\nreduction of 43%. Additionally, 93% preferred the Gaussian Splat interface\\noverall, with unanimous (100%) recommendations for future use, highlighting\\nimprovements in precision, responsiveness, and situational awareness. Finally,\\nwe demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through real-world\\nexperiments in two distinct application scenarios, showcasing the practical\\ncapabilities and versatility of the Splat-based VR interface.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T17:00:31Z\"}"}
