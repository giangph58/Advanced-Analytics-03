A novel\\nprocessing pipeline to track groups of people moving together and count their\\nnumbers is proposed and validated. The pipeline is specifically designed to\\ndeal with frequent changes of direction and stop & go movements typical of\\nindoor activities. The proposed approach combines a tracker with a classifier\\nto count the number of grouped people; this uses both spatial features\\nextracted from range-azimuth maps, and Doppler frequency features extracted\\nwith wavelet decomposition. Thus, the pipeline outputs over time both the\\nlocation and number of people present. The proposed approach is verified with\\nexperimental data collected with a 24 GHz Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave\\n(FMCW) radar. It is shown that the proposed method achieves 95.59% accuracy in\\ncounting the number of people, and a tracking metric OSPA of 0.338.\\nFurthermore, the performance is analyzed as a function of different relevant\\nvariables such as feature combinations and scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:56:03Z\"}"}
