{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01866v1\", \"title\": \"From Code Generation to Software Testing: AI Copilot with Context-Based\\n  RAG\", \"summary\": \"The rapid pace of large-scale software development places increasing demands\\non traditional testing methodologies, often leading to bottlenecks in\\nefficiency, accuracy, and coverage. We propose a novel perspective on software\\ntesting by positing bug detection and coding with fewer bugs as two\\ninterconnected problems that share a common goal, which is reducing bugs with\\nlimited resources. We extend our previous work on AI-assisted programming,\\nwhich supports code auto-completion and chatbot-powered Q&A, to the realm of\\nsoftware testing. We introduce Copilot for Testing, an automated testing system\\nthat synchronizes bug detection with codebase updates, leveraging context-based\\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the capabilities of large\\nlanguage models (LLMs). Our evaluation demonstrates a 31.2% improvement in bug\\ndetection accuracy, a 12.6% increase in critical test coverage, and a 10.5%\\nhigher user acceptance rate, highlighting the transformative potential of\\nAI-driven technologies in modern software development practices.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE,cs.AI,cs.PL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T16:20:05Z\"}"}
