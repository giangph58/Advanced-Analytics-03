{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04204v1\", \"title\": \"Cyber Security Data Science: Machine Learning Methods and their\\n  Performance on Imbalanced Datasets\", \"summary\": \"Cybersecurity has become essential worldwide and at all levels, concerning\\nindividuals, institutions, and governments. A basic principle in cybersecurity\\nis to be always alert. Therefore, automation is imperative in processes where\\nthe volume of daily operations is large. Several cybersecurity applications can\\nbe addressed as binary classification problems, including anomaly detection,\\nfraud detection, intrusion detection, spam detection, or malware detection. We\\npresent three experiments. In the first experiment, we evaluate single\\nclassifiers including Random Forests, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, eXtreme\\nGradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting\\nDecision Tree. In the second experiment, we test different sampling techniques\\nincluding over-sampling, under-sampling, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling\\nTechnique, and Self-Paced Ensembling. In the last experiment, we evaluate\\nSelf-Paced Ensembling and its number of base classifiers. We found that\\nimbalance learning techniques had positive and negative effects, as reported in\\nrelated studies. Thus, these techniques should be applied with caution.\\nBesides, we found different best performers for each dataset. Therefore, we\\nrecommend testing single classifiers and imbalance learning techniques for each\\nnew dataset and application involving imbalanced datasets as is the case in\\nseveral cyber security applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T07:57:33Z\"}"}
