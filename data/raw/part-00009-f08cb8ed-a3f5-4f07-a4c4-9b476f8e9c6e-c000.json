We\\nprove that $(\\\\lambda^+(M),\\\\lambda^-(M))$ is filling if $M$ is close to being\\nFuchsian. We also show that given any filling pair $(\\\\alpha_1,\\\\alpha_2)$ of\\nmeasured foliations, and every small enough $t>0$, the pair\\n$(t\\\\alpha_1,t\\\\alpha_2)$ is realised as the pair of measured foliations at\\ninfinity of some quasi-Fuchsian manifold $M$. This answers questions of\\nSchlenker near the Fuchsian locus.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GT\", \"categories\": \"math.GT,math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T04:03:33Z\"}"}
