{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15912v1\", \"title\": \"Automated Bug Report Prioritization in Large Open-Source Projects\", \"summary\": \"Large open-source projects receive a large number of issues (known as bugs),\\nincluding software defect (i.e., bug) reports and new feature requests from\\ntheir user and developer communities at a fast rate. The often limited project\\nresources do not allow them to deal with all issues. Instead, they have to\\nprioritize them according to the project's priorities and the issues'\\nseverities. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to automated bug\\nprioritization based on the natural language text of the bug reports that are\\nstored in the open bug repositories of the issue-tracking systems. We conduct\\ntopic modeling using a variant of LDA called TopicMiner-MTM and text\\nclassification with the BERT large language model to achieve a higher\\nperformance level compared to the state-of-the-art. Experimental results using\\nan existing reference dataset containing 85,156 bug reports of the Eclipse\\nPlatform project indicate that we outperform existing approaches in terms of\\nAccuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-measure of the bug report priority\\nprediction.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T13:57:48Z\"}"}
