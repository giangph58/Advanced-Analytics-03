In microscopy, imaging data provides a direct\\nmeasurement of the local structure, while spectroscopic measurements provide\\nrelevant functional property information. Deep kernel active learning\\napproaches have been utilized to rapidly map local structure to functional\\nproperties in microscopy experiments, but are computationally expensive for\\nmulti-dimensional and correlated output spaces. Here, we present an alternative\\nlightweight curiosity algorithm which actively samples regions with unexplored\\nstructure-property relations, utilizing a deep-learning based surrogate model\\nfor error prediction. We show that the algorithm outperforms random sampling\\nfor predicting properties from structures, and provides a convenient tool for\\nefficient mapping of structure-property relationships in materials science.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:31:29Z\"}"}
