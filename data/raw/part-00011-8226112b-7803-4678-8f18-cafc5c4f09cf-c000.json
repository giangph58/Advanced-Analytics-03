Currently, subjective visual judgment is\\ncommonly employed in clinical settings. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) offers a\\nnon-invasive, quantitative alternative. However, HSI imaging lacks continuous\\nintegration into the clinical workflow. This study presents a hyperspectral\\nlight field system for intraoperative tissue oxygen saturation (SO2) analysis\\nand visualization. We present a correlation method for determining SO2\\nsaturation with low computational demands. We demonstrate clinical application,\\nwith our results aligning with the perfusion boundaries determined by the\\nsurgeon. We perform and compare continuous perfusion analysis using two\\nhyperspectral cameras (Cubert S5, Cubert X20), achieving processing times of <\\n170 ms and < 400 ms, respectively. We discuss camera characteristics, system\\nparameters, and the suitability for clinical use and real-time applications.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,physics.med-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T07:59:04Z\"}"}
