We\\ndesign the optimal formation control law using an event-triggered control\\nscheme to achieve formation objectives under DoS attacks. Critic neural network\\n(NN)-based approach is employed to achieve the optimal control policy under DoS\\nattacks. Event-triggered mechanism is introduced to ensure the saving of\\ncontrol resources. Additionally, Lyapunov stability theory is utilized to\\ndemonstrate that the local neighborhood formation error exhibits exponential\\nstability and the estimation error of weights are uniformly ultimately bounded.\\nFinally, the effectiveness of the control algorithm is validated through matlab\\nsimulations. The results indicate that under DoS attacks, the nonlinear MAS\\nsuccessfully achieves the desired formation for the MAS.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T06:00:42Z\"}"}
