{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21486v1\", \"title\": \"Provably-Safe, Online System Identification\", \"summary\": \"Precise manipulation tasks require accurate knowledge of payload inertial\\nparameters. Unfortunately, identifying these parameters for unknown payloads\\nwhile ensuring that the robotic system satisfies its input and state\\nconstraints while avoiding collisions with the environment remains a\\nsignificant challenge. This paper presents an integrated framework that enables\\nrobotic manipulators to safely and automatically identify payload parameters\\nwhile maintaining operational safety guarantees. The framework consists of two\\nsynergistic components: an online trajectory planning and control framework\\nthat generates provably-safe exciting trajectories for system identification\\nthat can be tracked while respecting robot constraints and avoiding obstacles\\nand a robust system identification method that computes rigorous\\noverapproximative bounds on end-effector inertial parameters assuming bounded\\nsensor noise. Experimental validation on a robotic manipulator performing\\nchallenging tasks with various unknown payloads demonstrates the framework's\\neffectiveness in establishing accurate parameter bounds while maintaining\\nsafety throughout the identification process.
