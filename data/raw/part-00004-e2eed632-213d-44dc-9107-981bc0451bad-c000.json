This paper tackles the challenges of missing optical data\\nsynthesis, particularly in complex scenarios with cloud cover. We propose\\nCRSynthNet, a novel image synthesis network that incorporates innovative\\ndesigned modules such as the DownUp Block and Fusion Attention to enhance\\naccuracy. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of CRSynthNet,\\ndemonstrating substantial improvements in restoring structural details,\\npreserving spectral consist, and achieving superior visual effects that far\\nexceed those produced by comparison methods. It achieves quantitative\\nimprovements across multiple metrics: a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of\\n26.978, a structural similarity index measure (SSIM) of 0.648, and a root mean\\nsquare error (RMSE) of 0.050. Furthermore, this study creates the TCSEN12\\ndataset, a valuable resource specifically designed to address cloud cover\\nchallenges in missing optical data synthesis study. The dataset uniquely\\nincludes cloud-covered images and leverages earlier image to predict later\\nimage, offering a realistic representation of real-world scenarios. This study\\noffer practical method and valuable resources for optical satellite image\\nsynthesis task.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T16:44:53Z\"}"}
