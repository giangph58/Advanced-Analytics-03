Representing these\\nparticles in terms of Weyl spinors, we carry out their quantization. The\\npropagators of these fields are also constructed. Then, we apply the Hamilton\\ndynamics based formalism to describe massive Majorana neutrinos in matter on\\nthe classical level. Finally, we study a classical Dirac particle in vacuum,\\ndescribed with $c$-number variables, within the Hamiton formalism. Such a Dirac\\nfield is also canonically quantized.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T07:56:46Z\"}"}
