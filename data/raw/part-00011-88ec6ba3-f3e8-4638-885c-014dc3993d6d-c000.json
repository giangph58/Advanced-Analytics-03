Accurate causal estimation\\nrequires identifying confounding variables to avoid false discoveries. Pearl's\\ncausal model uses causal DAGs to identify confounding variables, but incorrect\\nDAGs can lead to unreliable causal conclusions. However, for high dimensional\\ndata, the causal DAGs are often complex beyond human verifiability. Graph\\nsummarization is a logical next step, but current methods for general-purpose\\ngraph summarization are inadequate for causal DAG summarization. This paper\\naddresses these challenges by proposing a causal graph summarization objective\\nthat balances graph simplification for better understanding while retaining\\nessential causal information for reliable inference. We develop an efficient\\ngreedy algorithm and show that summary causal DAGs can be directly used for\\ninference and are more robust to misspecification of assumptions, enhancing\\nrobustness for causal inference. Experimenting with six real-life datasets, we\\ncompared our algorithm to three existing solutions, showing its effectiveness\\nin handling high-dimensional data and its ability to generate summary DAGs that\\nensure both reliable causal inference and robustness against misspecifications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.DB,stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T08:01:32Z\"}"}
