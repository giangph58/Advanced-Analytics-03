{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01797v1\", \"title\": \"Rethinking industrial artificial intelligence: a unified foundation\\n  framework\", \"summary\": \"Recent advancement in industrial artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping\\nthe industry, driving smarter manufacturing, predictive maintenance, and\\nintelligent decision-making. However, existing approaches often focus primarily\\non algorithms and models, overlooking the importance of systematically\\nintegrating domain knowledge, data, and models to ensure more comprehensive and\\neffective AI solutions. Therefore, the effective development and deployment of\\nIndustrial AI solutions require a more comprehensive and systematic approach.\\nTo address this gap, this paper summarizes previous research and rethinks the\\nrole of industrial AI and presents a unified industrial AI foundation framework\\ncomprising three core modules: knowledge module, data module, and model module.\\nThese modules help to extend and enhance the industrial AI methodology\\nplatform, supporting various industrial applications. In addition, a case study\\non rotating machinery diagnosis demonstrates the framework's effectiveness, and\\nseveral future directions are highlighted for the development of the industrial\\nAI foundation framework.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:05:32Z\"}"}
