Additionally, slight differences in VR content\\nacross studies can lead to conflicting results. To address these challenges, we\\npropose a standardized assessment framework to facilitate cybersickness\\nresearch. The main goal is to enable consistent and comparable CS-related\\nexperiments. By establishing this common foundation, researchers can better\\nevaluate and compare the impact of various factors on cybersickness. We provide\\na comprehensive explanation of the conceptual designs, detail the technical\\nimplementation, and offer instructions for using the proposed framework.\\nLastly, we conclude by discussing the limitations and potential avenues for\\nfuture development.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:15:10Z\"}"}
