Our approach relies on the\\nuse of theoretically proven under- and overapproximations of the Riemannian\\ndistance function. We compare it to the exact computation of the Riemannian\\nbarycenter and to an approach that approximates the Riemannian logarithm using\\nlifting maps. Experiments are conducted on the Stiefel manifold.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T07:52:10Z\"}"}
