In this paper, we introduce a Hybrid\\nQuantum Recurrent Neural Network framework, combining Quantum Long Short-Term\\nMemory layers with classical dense layers for Remaining Useful Life forecasting\\non NASA's Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation dataset. Each\\nQuantum Long Short-Term Memory gate replaces conventional linear\\ntransformations with Quantum Depth-Infused circuits, allowing the network to\\nlearn high-frequency components more effectively. Experimental results\\ndemonstrate that, despite having fewer trainable parameters, the Hybrid Quantum\\nRecurrent Neural Network achieves up to a 5% improvement over a Recurrent\\nNeural Network based on stacked Long Short-Term Memory layers in terms of mean\\nroot mean squared error and mean absolute error. Moreover, a thorough\\ncomparison of our method with established techniques, including Random Forest,\\nConvolutional Neural Network, and Multilayer Perceptron, demonstrates that our\\napproach, which achieves a Root Mean Squared Error of 15.46, surpasses these\\nbaselines by approximately 13.68%, 16.21%, and 7.87%, respectively.\\nNevertheless, it remains outperformed by certain advanced joint architectures.\\nOur findings highlight the potential of hybrid quantum-classical approaches for\\nrobust time-series forecasting under limited data conditions, offering new\\navenues for enhancing reliability in predictive maintenance tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:41:41Z\"}"}
