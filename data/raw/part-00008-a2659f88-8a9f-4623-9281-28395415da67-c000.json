This article aims to establish a standardized terminology for\\nvoice cloning and explore its different variations. It will cover speaker\\nadaptation as the fundamental concept and then delve deeper into topics such as\\nfew-shot, zero-shot, and multilingual TTS within that context. Finally, we will\\nexplore the evaluation metrics commonly used in voice cloning research and\\nrelated datasets. This survey compiles the available voice cloning algorithms\\nto encourage research toward its generation and detection to limit its misuse.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SD\", \"categories\": \"cs.SD,cs.AI,eess.AS\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T15:10:29Z\"}"}
