{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12821v1\", \"title\": \"Revisiting the Haken Lighthouse Model\", \"summary\": \"Simple spiking neural network models, such as those built from interacting\\nintegrate-and-fire (IF) units, exhibit rich emergent behaviours but remain\\nnotoriously difficult to analyse, particularly in terms of their\\npattern-forming properties. In contrast, rate-based models and coupled phase\\noscillators offer greater mathematical tractability but fail to capture the\\nfull dynamical complexity of spiking networks. To bridge these modelling\\nparadigms, Hermann Haken -- the pioneer of Synergetics -- introduced the\\nLighthouse model, a framework that provides insights into synchronisation,\\ntravelling waves, and pattern formation in neural systems.\\n  In this work, we revisit the Lighthouse model and develop new mathematical\\nresults that deepen our understanding of self-organisation in spiking neural\\nnetworks. Specifically, we derive the linear stability conditions for\\nphase-locked spiking states in Lighthouse networks structured on graphs with\\nrealistic synaptic interactions ($\\\\alpha$-function synapses) and axonal\\nconduction delays. Extending the analysis on graphs to a spatially continuous\\n(non-local) setting, we develop a variant of Turing instability analysis to\\nexplore emergent spiking patterns. Finally, we show how localised spiking bump\\nsolutions -- which are difficult to mathematically analyse in IF networks --\\nare far more tractable in the Lighthouse model and analyse their linear\\nstability to wandering states.\\n  These results reaffirm the Lighthouse model as a valuable tool for studying\\nstructured neural interactions and self-organisation, further advancing the\\nsynergetic perspective on spiking neural dynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T10:26:06Z\"}"}
