{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03158v1\", \"title\": \"FAST Reveals the Extended HI Halo and Accretion Signatures of NGC2683\", \"summary\": \"We present the results of our recent HI observations conducted on the edge-on\\ngalaxy NGC2683 using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope\\n(FAST). In comparison to previous observations made by the VLA, FAST has\\ndetected a more extensive distribution of HI. Particularly noteworthy is that\\nthe detections made by FAST extend approximately four times farther than those\\nof the VLA in the vertical direction from the galactic plane. The total HI flux\\nmeasured for NGC2683 amounts to $F_{\\\\rm HI} = 112.1\\\\,\\\\rm{Jy\\\\,km\\\\,s^{-1}}$\\n(equivalent to a total HI mass of $M_{\\\\rm HI} = 2.32 \\\\times 10^9\\\\,{\\\\rm\\nM_\\\\odot}$), which is slightly higher than that detected by VLA. FAST has also\\nidentified three dwarf galaxies in close proximity to NGC2683, namely KK69,\\nNGC2683dw1 (hereafter dw1), and NGC2683dw3$?$ (hereafter dw3$?$). dw3$?$ is\\nsituated within the extended HI distribution of NGC2683 in projection and lies\\nnear the tail of KK69 extending towards NGC2683. These observations suggest\\nthat dw3$?$ is likely a result of the accretion process from NGC2683 to KK69.\\nFurthermore, FAST has detected three high-velocity clouds (HVCs), with complex\\nB potentially undergoing accretion with NGC2683. Based on the model from\\nVollmer et al. 2016 and incorporating the HI halo component, we found that the\\nmodel with the added HI halo aligns more closely with our FAST observations in\\nNGC2683. The estimated mass of this HI halo is $3 \\\\times 10^8\\\\,{\\\\rm M_\\\\odot}$,\\nconstituting approximately 13% of the total HI mass of the galaxy. We suggest\\nthat the origination of this HI halo is more likely attributed to external gas\\naccretion.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T04:11:57Z\"}"}
