{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11139v1\", \"title\": \"Non-stabilizerness in open XXZ spin chains: Universal scaling and\\n  dynamics\", \"summary\": \"Magic, or non-stabilizerness, is a crucial quantum resource, yet its dynamics\\nin open quantum systems remain largely unexplored. We investigate magic in the\\nopen XXZ spin chain under either boundary gain and loss, or bulk dephasing\\nusing the stabilizer R\\\\'enyi entropy $M_2$. To enable scalable simulations of\\nlarge systems, we develop a novel, highly efficient algorithm for computing\\n$M_2$ within the matrix product states formalism while maintaining constant\\nbond dimension--an advancement over existing methods. For boundary driving, we\\nuncover universal scaling laws, $M_2(t) \\\\sim t^{1/z}$, linked to the dynamical\\nexponent $z$ for several distinct universality classes. We also disentangle\\nclassical and quantum contributions to magic by introducing a mean-field\\napproximation for magic, thus emphasizing the prominent role of quantum\\ncritical fluctuations in non-stabilizerness. For bulk dephasing, dissipation\\ncan transiently enhance magic before suppressing it, and drive it to a\\nnontrivial steady-state value. These findings position magic as a powerful\\ndiagnostic tool for probing universality and dynamics in open quantum systems.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T12:41:52Z\"}"}
