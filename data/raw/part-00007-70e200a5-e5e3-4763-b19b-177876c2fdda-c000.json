We compared\\nthe transition probabilities of the detector in scenarios where the\\ngravitational wave is quantized versus when it is treated classically. Assuming\\nthe gravitational wave propagates in one direction and has only one type of\\npolarization, we found that for graviton states such as coherent, squeezed, and\\nsqueezed coherent states, quantum gravity signatures can emerge in events that\\nwould not be possible when the graviton state is a quantum state with $n_G$\\nparticles $(\\\\ket{n_G})$, such as graviton annihilation and the increasing\\nenergy level of the detector by two levels in final state.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:45:57Z\"}"}
