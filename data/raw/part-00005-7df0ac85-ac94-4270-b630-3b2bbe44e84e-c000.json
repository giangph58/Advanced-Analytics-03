In optically tunable\\nsuperconducting heterostructures, the lattice responses at the buried interface\\nmay hold the key to the light susceptibility but is very challenging to detect.\\nIn this work, a nondestructive synchrotron-based X-ray scattering\\nphase-retrieval technique is implemented in monolayer-FeSe/SrTiO3\\nheterostructures to capture the three-dimensional interfacial atomic\\ndisplacements in-situ as the interface superconductivity is actively\\nmanipulated by light. It is found that the interlayer sliding between FeSe and\\nSrTiO3 can drastically alter how the lattice responds to the light. In domains\\nwith selected stacking configurations, the interface transforms the very weak\\nphotoexcitation in SrTiO3 into significant Fe-atom displacements in FeSe and\\ngenerate metastable interfacial structures that can lead to a persistent\\nsuperconductivity enhancement. These findings demonstrate an effective strategy\\nfor achieving greatly amplified light-lattice coupling for efficient quantum\\nphase manipulations at designed interfaces.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T08:17:45Z\"}"}
