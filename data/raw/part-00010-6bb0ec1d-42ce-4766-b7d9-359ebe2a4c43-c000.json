While there\\nhas been significant work on improving and evaluating state-of-the-art models\\nand measuring various properties of recommender system outputs, less attention\\nhas been given to the data itself, particularly how data has changed over time.\\nSuch documentation and analysis provide guidance and context for designing and\\nevaluating recommender systems, particularly for evaluation designs making use\\nof time (e.g., temporal splitting). In this paper, we present a temporal\\nexplanatory analysis of the UCSD Book Graph dataset scraped from Goodreads, a\\nsocial reading and recommendation platform active since 2006. We measure the\\nbook interaction data using a set of activity, diversity, and fairness metrics;\\nwe then train a set of collaborative filtering algorithms on rolling training\\nwindows to observe how the same measures evolve over time in the\\nrecommendations. Additionally, we explore whether the introduction of\\nalgorithmic recommendations in 2011 was followed by observable changes in user\\nor recommender system behavior.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T15:45:04Z\"}"}
