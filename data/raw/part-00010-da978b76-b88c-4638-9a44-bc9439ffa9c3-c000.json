{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01640v1\", \"title\": \"Controlling photo-excited electron-spin by light-polarization in\\n  ultrafast-pumped altermagnets\", \"summary\": \"Altermagnets (AMs) constitute a novel class of spin-compensated materials in\\nwhich the symmetry connecting opposite-spin sublattices involves a spatial\\nrotation. Here, we uncover a set of unique non-linear, light-driven properties\\nthat set AMs apart from traditional ferro- and antiferromagnets. We demonstrate\\ntheoretically that the polarization of an electromagnetic pulse that\\nphoto-excites electrons and holes in an AM, controls the spin orientation of\\nthese non-equilibrium charge carriers. For a d-wave AM model and a prototype\\nmaterial, we show that very large post-pump spin polarizations may be attained\\nby exploiting resonances. We show that this protocol also allows, in an AM, to\\ndirectly probe the spin splitting of the electronic states in energy and\\nmomentum space. Thus, it can be used to identify and characterize altermagnetic\\nmaterials via ultrafast pump-probe Kerr/Faraday spectroscopy or spin- and\\ntime-resolved ARPES. This opens up the possibility of devising ultrafast\\noptical switches of non-equilibrium spin-polarization, finely tunable by\\nadjusting the pump-pulse characteristics.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:43:45Z\"}"}
