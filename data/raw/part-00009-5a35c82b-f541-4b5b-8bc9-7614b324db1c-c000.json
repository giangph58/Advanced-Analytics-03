In this paper, we define partial\\ngroupoid structures on cyclic pattern-avoiding permutations that allow us to\\nbuild larger cyclic pattern-avoiding permutations from smaller ones. We use\\nthis structure to find recursive lower bounds on $c_n(\\\\sigma)$. These bounds\\nimply that $c_n(\\\\sigma)$ has a growth rate of at least 3 for\\n$\\\\sigma\\\\in\\\\{231,312,321\\\\}$ and a growth rate of at least 2.6 for\\n$\\\\sigma\\\\in\\\\{123,132,213\\\\}$. In the process, we prove (and sometimes improve) a\\nconjecture of B\\\\'{o}na and Cory that $c_n(\\\\sigma)\\\\geq 2 c_{n-1}(\\\\sigma)$ for\\nall $\\\\sigma\\\\in\\\\mathcal{S}_3\\\\setminus\\\\{123\\\\}$ and $n\\\\geq 2.$\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:27:15Z\"}"}
