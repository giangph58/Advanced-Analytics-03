{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06628v1\", \"title\": \"Entropy Production in Non-Gaussian Active Matter: A Unified Fluctuation\\n  Theorem and Deep Learning Framework\", \"summary\": \"We present a general framework for deriving entropy production rates in\\nactive matter systems driven by non-Gaussian active fluctuations. Employing the\\nprobability flow equivalence technique, we rigorously derive an entropy\\nproduction decomposition formula and demonstrate that the entropy production,\\n$\\\\Delta s_\\\\mathrm{tot}$, satisfies the integral fluctuation theorem $\\\\langle\\n\\\\exp[ -\\\\Delta s_\\\\mathrm{tot} + B_\\\\mathrm{act}] \\\\rangle = 1$ and the generalized\\nsecond law of thermodynamics $\\\\langle \\\\Delta s_\\\\mathrm{tot}\\\\rangle \\\\geq\\\\langle\\nB_\\\\mathrm{act}\\\\rangle$, where $B_\\\\mathrm{act}$ is a path-dependent random\\nvariable associated with the active fluctuations. Our result holds generally\\nfor arbitrary initial conditions, encompassing both steady-state and transient\\nfinite-time regimes. In the limiting case where active fluctuations are absent\\n(i.e., $B_\\\\mathrm{act} \\\\equiv 0$), the theorem reduces to the well-established\\nresults in stochastic thermodynamics. Building on the theoretical foundation,\\nwe propose a deep learning-based methodology to efficiently compute the entropy\\nproduction, utilizing the L\\\\'{e}vy score function we proposed. To illustrate\\nthe validity of this approach, we apply it to two representative systems: a\\nBrownian particle in a periodic active bath and an active polymer system\\nconsisting of an active Brownian particle cross-linker interacting with passive\\nBrownian beads. Our results provide a unified framework for analyzing entropy\\nproduction in active matter systems while offering practical computational\\ntools for investigating complex nonequilibrium behaviors.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T07:02:02Z\"}"}
