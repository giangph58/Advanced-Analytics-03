We construct sheaves of\\n$p$-adic Cherednik algebras on the small \\\\'etale site of the quotient $X/G$,\\nand study some of their properties. The sheaves of $p$-adic Cherednik algebras\\nare sheaves of Fr\\\\'echet $K$-algebras on $X/G$, which can be regarded as\\n$p$-adic analytic versions of the sheaves of Cherednik algebras associated to\\nthe action of a finite group on a smooth algebraic variety defined by P.\\nEtingof. Furthermore, their sections on small enough $G$-invariant affinoid\\nspaces are canonically Fr\\\\'echet-Stein algebras. Along the way, we construct\\nsheaves of infinite order twisted differential operators on $X$, we give a\\n$G$-equivariant classification of the Atiyah algebras (Picard algebroids) on\\n$X$, and study the category of co-admissible modules over a sheaf of infinite\\norder twisted differential operators.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT,math.AG,math.QA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T13:20:05Z\"}"}
