It was shown, via the global method for relaxation,\\nthat the relaxed functional admits an integral representation and the relaxed\\nenergy densities were identified. In this paper we show that, under certain\\nhypotheses on the original densities, the corresponding relaxed energy\\ndensities verify the same type of growth conditions and the surface energy\\ndensity satisfies a specific ``convexity-type'' property, i.e. it is\\n$SBH$-elliptic.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T12:57:43Z\"}"}
