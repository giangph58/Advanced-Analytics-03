{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13141v1\", \"title\": \"Complexity at Scale: A Quantitative Analysis of an Alibaba Microservice\\n  Deployment\", \"summary\": \"Microservice architectures are increasingly prevalent in organisations\\nproviding online applications. Recent studies have begun to explore the\\ncharacteristics of real-world large-scale microservice deployments; however,\\ntheir operational complexities, and the degree to which this complexities are\\nconsistent across different deployments, remains under-explored. In this paper,\\nwe analyse a microservice dataset released by Alibaba along three dimensions of\\ncomplexity: scale, heterogeneity, and dynamicity. We find that large-scale\\ndeployments can consist of tens of thousands of microservices, that support an\\neven broader array of front-end functionality. Moreover, our analysis shows\\nwide-spread long-tailed distributions of characteristics between microservices,\\nsuch as share of workload and dependencies, highlighting inequality across the\\ndeployment. This diversity is also reflected in call graphs, where we find that\\nwhilst front-end services produce dominant call graphs, rarer non-dominant call\\ngraphs are prevalent and could involve dissimilar microservice calls. We also\\nfind that runtime dependencies between microservices deviate from the static\\nview of system dependencies, and that the deployment undergoes daily changes to\\nmicroservices. We discuss the implications of our findings for state-of-the-art\\nresearch in microservice management and research testbed realism, and compare\\nour results to previous descriptions of large-scale microservice deployments to\\nbegin to build an understanding of their commonalities.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC,cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:50:44Z\"}"}
