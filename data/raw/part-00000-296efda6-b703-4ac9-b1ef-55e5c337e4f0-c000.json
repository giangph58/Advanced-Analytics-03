{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05371v1\", \"title\": \"From Sleep Staging to Spindle Detection: Evaluating End-to-End Automated\\n  Sleep Analysis\", \"summary\": \"Automation of sleep analysis, including both macrostructural (sleep stages)\\nand microstructural (e.g., sleep spindles) elements, promises to enable\\nlarge-scale sleep studies and to reduce variance due to inter-rater\\nincongruencies. While individual steps, such as sleep staging and spindle\\ndetection, have been studied separately, the feasibility of automating\\nmulti-step sleep analysis remains unclear. Here, we evaluate whether a fully\\nautomated analysis using state-of-the-art machine learning models for sleep\\nstaging (RobustSleepNet) and subsequent spindle detection (SUMOv2) can\\nreplicate findings from an expert-based study of bipolar disorder. The\\nautomated analysis qualitatively reproduced key findings from the expert-based\\nstudy, including significant differences in fast spindle densities between\\nbipolar patients and healthy controls, accomplishing in minutes what previously\\ntook months to complete manually. While the results of the automated analysis\\ndiffered quantitatively from the expert-based study, possibly due to biases\\nbetween expert raters or between raters and the models, the models individually\\nperformed at or above inter-rater agreement for both sleep staging and spindle\\ndetection. Our results demonstrate that fully automated approaches have the\\npotential to facilitate large-scale sleep research. We are providing public\\naccess to the tools used in our automated analysis by sharing our code and\\nintroducing SomnoBot, a privacy-preserving sleep analysis platform.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP,cs.LG,q-bio.NC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T16:07:10Z\"}"}
