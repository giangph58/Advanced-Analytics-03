{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20586v1\", \"title\": \"Faster Random Walk-based Capacitance Extraction with Generalized\\n  Antithetic Sampling\", \"summary\": \"Floating random walk-based capacitance extraction has emerged in recent years\\nas a tried and true approach for extracting parasitic capacitance in very large\\nscale integrated circuits. Being a Monte Carlo method, its performance is\\ndependent on the variance of sampled quantities and variance reduction methods\\nare crucial for the challenges posed by ever denser process technologies and\\nlayout-dependent effects. In this work, we present a novel, universal variance\\nreduction method for floating random walk-based capacitance extraction, which\\nis conceptually simple, highly efficient and provably reduces variance in all\\nextractions, especially when layout-dependent effects are present. It is\\ncomplementary to existing mathematical formulations for variance reduction and\\nits performance gains are experienced on top of theirs. Numerical experiments\\ndemonstrate substantial such gains of up to 30% in number of walks necessary\\nand even more in actual extraction times compared to the best previously\\nproposed variance reduction approaches for the floating random-walk.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.comp-ph,cs.CE,stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T09:40:21Z\"}"}
