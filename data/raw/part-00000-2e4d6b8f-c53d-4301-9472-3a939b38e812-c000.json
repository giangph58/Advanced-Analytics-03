{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21372v1\", \"title\": \"Retrieval-Enhanced Few-Shot Prompting for Speech Event Extraction\", \"summary\": \"Speech Event Extraction (SpeechEE) is a challenging task that lies at the\\nintersection of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Natural Language\\nProcessing (NLP), requiring the identification of structured event information\\nfrom spoken language. In this work, we present a modular, pipeline-based\\nSpeechEE framework that integrates high-performance ASR with semantic\\nsearch-enhanced prompting of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our system first\\nclassifies speech segments likely to contain events using a hybrid filtering\\nmechanism including rule-based, BERT-based, and LLM-based models. It then\\nemploys few-shot LLM prompting, dynamically enriched via semantic similarity\\nretrieval, to identify event triggers and extract corresponding arguments. We\\nevaluate the pipeline using multiple LLMs (Llama3-8B, GPT-4o-mini, and o1-mini)\\nhighlighting significant performance gains with o1-mini, which achieves 63.3%\\nF1 on trigger classification and 27.8% F1 on argument classification,\\noutperforming prior benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that pipeline\\napproaches, when empowered by retrieval-augmented LLMs, can rival or exceed\\nend-to-end systems while maintaining interpretability and modularity. This work\\nprovides practical insights into LLM-driven event extraction and opens pathways\\nfor future hybrid models combining textual and acoustic features.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T07:10:10Z\"}"}
