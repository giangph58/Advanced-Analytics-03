{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19510v1\", \"title\": \"Neutrino Constraints on Black Hole Formation in M31\", \"summary\": \"We investigate neutrino signals associated with black hole formation\\nresulting from the gravitational collapse of massive stars, motivated by the\\ncandidate failed supernova M31-2014-DS1 in the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). By\\ncompiling numerical simulation results for stellar collapse, we predict the\\nexpected neutrino emission and compare these predictions with observational\\nlimits from Super-Kamiokande (SK). The simulations reveal a characteristic\\nprecursor signal consisting of a short, intense burst whose average neutrino\\nenergy rises rapidly and then ceases abruptly once the black hole forms. We\\nexamine several nuclear equations of state, specifically the Lattimer \\\\&\\nSwesty, Shen, Togashi, and SFHo models, to evaluate how the emission depends on\\nneutron-star properties and nuclear-physics uncertainties. Comparison of the\\npredicted event counts with SK's non-detection of neutrinos coincident with\\nM31-2014-DS1 already rules out part of the model space and highlights the\\nsensitivity of current neutrino detectors to both progenitor mass and the EOS.\\nThese findings demonstrate the capability of neutrino astronomy to probe core\\ncollapse and black hole formation in failed supernova scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T06:19:36Z\"}"}
