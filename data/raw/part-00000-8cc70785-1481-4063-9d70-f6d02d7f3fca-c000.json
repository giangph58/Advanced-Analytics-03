{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00323v1\", \"title\": \"Recursive Algorithms for Sparse Parameter Identification of Multivariate\\n  Stochastic Systems with Non-stationary Observations\", \"summary\": \"The classical sparse parameter identification methods are usually based on\\nthe iterative basis selection such as greedy algorithms, or the numerical\\noptimization of regularized cost functions such as LASSO and Bayesian posterior\\nprobability distribution, etc., which, however, are not suitable for online\\nsparsity inference when data arrive sequentially. This paper presents recursive\\nalgorithms for sparse parameter identification of multivariate stochastic\\nsystems with non-stationary observations. First, a new bivariate criterion\\nfunction is presented by introducing an auxiliary variable matrix into a\\nweighted $L_1$ regularization criterion. The new criterion function is\\nsubsequently decomposed into two solvable subproblems via alternating\\noptimization of the two variable matrices, for which the optimizers can be\\nexplicitly formulated into recursive equations. Second, under the\\nnon-stationary and non-persistent excitation conditions on the systems,\\ntheoretical properties of the recursive algorithms are established. That is,\\nthe estimates are proved to be with (i) set convergence, i.e., the accurate\\nestimation of the sparse index set of the unknown parameter matrix, and (ii)\\nparameter convergence, i.e., the consistent estimation for values of the\\nnon-zero elements of the unknown parameter matrix. Finally, numerical examples\\nare given to support the theoretical analysis.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T05:47:17Z\"}"}
