However,\\nat this transition the structure also changes, from orthorhombic to monoclinic,\\nleaving open the question of whether it is driven primarily by excitonic\\nordering or by a lattice instability. A lattice instability of this symmetry\\nwould correspond to softening of a B$_{2g}$ optical or acoustic phonon mode.\\nHere, we report that elastocaloric measurements of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ with induced\\nB$_{2g}$ strain reveal a thermodynamic susceptibility described by a\\nCurie-Weiss law with a Curie temperature $T^*$ of 298 K. The fact that $T^*$ is\\nclose to $T_S$ rules out the possibility that the B$_{2g}$ acoustic mode is\\nresponsible for the transition. Since prior Raman measurements have shown\\nminimal softening of the B$_{2g}$ optical mode as well, our finding strengthens\\nthe case that the transition is largely excitonic in nature. Our work\\nunderscores the potential of using strain as a tool for separating electronic\\nand lattice contributions in phase transitions.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T03:38:21Z\"}"}
