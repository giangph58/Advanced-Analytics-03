{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00426v1\", \"title\": \"Leveraging Pretrained Diffusion Models for Zero-Shot Part Assembly\", \"summary\": \"3D part assembly aims to understand part relationships and predict their\\n6-DoF poses to construct realistic 3D shapes, addressing the growing demand for\\nautonomous assembly, which is crucial for robots. Existing methods mainly\\nestimate the transformation of each part by training neural networks under\\nsupervision, which requires a substantial quantity of manually labeled data.\\nHowever, the high cost of data collection and the immense variability of\\nreal-world shapes and parts make traditional methods impractical for\\nlarge-scale applications. In this paper, we propose first a zero-shot part\\nassembly method that utilizes pre-trained point cloud diffusion models as\\ndiscriminators in the assembly process, guiding the manipulation of parts to\\nform realistic shapes. Specifically, we theoretically demonstrate that\\nutilizing a diffusion model for zero-shot part assembly can be transformed into\\nan Iterative Closest Point (ICP) process. Then, we propose a novel pushing-away\\nstrategy to address the overlap parts, thereby further enhancing the robustness\\nof the method. To verify our work, we conduct extensive experiments and\\nquantitative comparisons to several strong baseline methods, demonstrating the\\neffectiveness of the proposed approach, which even surpasses the supervised\\nlearning method.
