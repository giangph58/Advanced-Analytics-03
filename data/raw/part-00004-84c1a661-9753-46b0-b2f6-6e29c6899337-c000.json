The principal must perform\\ncostly inspections to determine the agent's eligibility. We characterize Markov\\nPerfect Equilibria and analyze the paths of trust and oversight that emerge\\nfrom the dynamic interplay of effort and oversight. At high trust levels,\\neffort is an intertemporal substitute to oversight, which leads to unique\\ninterior effort choices and random inspections. At low trust levels, effort is\\nan intertemporal complement to oversight, which may create a coordination\\nproblem, leading to equilibrium multiplicity. Voluntary disclosure can mitigate\\nthis coordination issue.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.TH\", \"categories\": \"econ.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:32:41Z\"}"}
