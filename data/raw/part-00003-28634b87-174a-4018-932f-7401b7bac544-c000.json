This notion\\nwas introduced by Petr\\\\v{s}evski and \\\\v{S}krekovski in 2022. In this paper, we\\nfocus on odd coloring of $k$-trees, where a $k$-tree is a graph obtained from\\nthe complete graph of order $k+1$ by recursively adding a new vertex that is\\njoined to a clique of order $k$ in the former graph. It follows from a result\\nof Cranston, Lafferty, and Song in 2023 that every $k$-tree is odd\\n$(2k+1)$-colorable. We improve this bound to show that every $k$-tree is odd\\n$\\\\left(k+2\\\\left\\\\lfloor\\\\log_2 k\\\\right\\\\rfloor+3\\\\right)$-colorable. Furthermore,\\nwhen $k=2,3$, we show the tight bound that every 2-tree is odd $4$-colorable\\nand that every 3-tree is odd $5$-colorable.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T09:27:26Z\"}"}
