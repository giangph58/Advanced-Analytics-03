Focusing exclusively on electron-phonon interaction,\\norientational relaxation is introduced and acts as dephasing of the optical\\nexcitation on a scale of tens of fs. In the linear regime, our numerical\\nresults agree with the experimental fits to a Drude model and predicts for\\nnon-linear excitations a field strength dependency of the orientational\\nrelaxation rate. In the THz regime, where the orientational relaxation proceeds\\nfaster than the oscillation cycle of the excitation THz field, a new high order\\ndissipative Kerr-type non-linearity is predicted. This non-linearity originates\\nfrom the Pauli blocking included in the electron-phonon scattering and results\\nin a non-linearly increasing transmission of the film, detectable in\\nexperiments.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T12:30:21Z\"}"}
