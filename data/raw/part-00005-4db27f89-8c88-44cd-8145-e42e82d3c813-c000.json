{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21614v1\", \"title\": \"Mcity Data Engine: Iterative Model Improvement Through Open-Vocabulary\\n  Data Selection\", \"summary\": \"With an ever-increasing availability of data, it has become more and more\\nchallenging to select and label appropriate samples for the training of machine\\nlearning models. It is especially difficult to detect long-tail classes of\\ninterest in large amounts of unlabeled data. This holds especially true for\\nIntelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), where vehicle fleets and roadside\\nperception systems generate an abundance of raw data. While industrial,\\nproprietary data engines for such iterative data selection and model training\\nprocesses exist, researchers and the open-source community suffer from a lack\\nof an openly available system. We present the Mcity Data Engine, which provides\\nmodules for the complete data-based development cycle, beginning at the data\\nacquisition phase and ending at the model deployment stage. The Mcity Data\\nEngine focuses on rare and novel classes through an open-vocabulary data\\nselection process.
