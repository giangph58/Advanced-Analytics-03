{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10476v1\", \"title\": \"Donor-Acceptor Pairs near Silicon Carbide surfaces\", \"summary\": \"Donor-acceptor pairs (DAPs) in wide-bandgap semiconductors are promising\\nplatforms for the realization of quantum technologies, due to their optically\\ncontrollable, long-range dipolar interactions. Specifically, Al-N DAPs in bulk\\nsilicon carbide (SiC) have been predicted to enable coherent coupling over\\ndistances exceeding 10 nm. However, their practical implementations require an\\nunderstanding of the properties of these pairs near surfaces and interfaces.\\nHere, using first principles calculations we investigate how the presence of\\nsurfaces influence the stability and optical properties of Al-N DAPs in SiC,\\nand we show that they retain favorable optical properties comparable to their\\nbulk counterparts, despite a slight increase in electron-phonon coupling.\\nFurthermore, we introduce the concept of surface-defect pairs (SDPs), where an\\nelectron-hole pair is generated between a near-surface defect and an occupied\\nsurface state located in the bandgap of the material. We show that\\nvanadium-based SDPs near OH-terminated 4H-SiC surfaces exhibit dipoles\\nnaturally aligned perpendicular to the surface, greatly enhancing dipole-dipole\\ncoupling between SDPs. Our results also reveal significant\\npolarization-dependent modulation in the stimulated emission and\\nphotoionization cross sections of V-based SDPs, which are tunable by two orders\\nof magnitude via the polarization angle of the incident laser light. The\\nnear-surface defects investigated here provide novel possibilities for the\\ndevelopment of hybrid quantum-classical interfaces, as they can be used to\\nmediate information transfer between quantum nodes and integrated photonic\\ncircuits.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.comp-ph,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:58:59Z\"}"}
