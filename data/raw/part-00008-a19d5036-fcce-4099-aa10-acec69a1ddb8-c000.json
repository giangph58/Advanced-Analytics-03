As an illustration, we consider the detection of\\natmospheric dark matter in the liquid scintillator detectors. The results show\\nthat the constraint on the DM-nucleon interaction from KamLAND is approximately\\none order of magnitude more stringent than those obtained from the elastic\\nnuclear recoil signals in dark matter direct detection experiments.\\nFurthermore, a larger volume neutrino experiment, such as JUNO, is expected to\\nsignificantly enhance the light dark matter detection sensitivity through the\\nquasi-elastic scattering.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T15:16:06Z\"}"}
