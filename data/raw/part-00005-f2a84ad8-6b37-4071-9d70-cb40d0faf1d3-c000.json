This gives rise to different potential notions of\\ndiscreteness for an inclusion in the non-irreducible case, and provides a\\nunified framework that encloses the theory of compact quantum group actions. We\\nalso provide examples coming from semi-circular systems and from factorization\\nhomology. In the irreducible case, we establish conditions under which the\\nC*-discrete and W*-discrete conditions are equivalent.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OA\", \"categories\": \"math.OA,math.QA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T16:33:24Z\"}"}
