The behavior of\\nobjects of $\\\\operatorname{Morph}(\\\\operatorname{Mod} R)$ whose endomorphism ring\\nin $\\\\operatorname{Morph}(\\\\operatorname{Mod} R)$ is semilocal is very similar to\\nthe behavior of modules with a semilocal endomorphism ring. For instance,\\ndirect-sum decompositions of a direct sum $\\\\oplus_{i=1}^nM_i$, that is,\\nblock-diagonal decompositions, where each object $M_i$ of\\n$\\\\operatorname{Morph}(\\\\operatorname{Mod} R)$ denotes a morphism\\n$\\\\mu_{M_i}\\\\colon M_{0,i}\\\\to M_{1,i}$ and where all the modules $M_{j,i}$ have a\\nlocal endomorphism ring $\\\\operatorname{End}(M_{j,i})$, depend on two\\ninvariants. This behavior is very similar to that of direct-sum decompositions\\nof serial modules of finite Goldie dimension, which also depend on two\\ninvariants (monogeny class and epigeny class). When all the modules $M_{j,i}$\\nare uniserial modules, the direct-sum decompositions (block-diagonal\\ndecompositions) of a direct-sum $\\\\oplus_{i=1}^nM_i$ depend on four invariants.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RA\", \"categories\": \"math.RA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T12:02:26Z\"}"}
