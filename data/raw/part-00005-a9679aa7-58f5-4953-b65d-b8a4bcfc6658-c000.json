The PTC estimator leverages inter-sample\\nrelationships to compute a low-rank Poisson tensor decomposition of the\\nfrequency histogram. Our crucial observation is that the histogram bins are an\\ninstance of a space partitioning of counts and thus can be identified with a\\nspatial Poisson process. The Poisson tensor decomposition leads to a completion\\nof the intensity measure over all bins -- including those containing few to no\\nsamples -- and leads to our proposed PTC differential entropy estimator. A\\nPoisson tensor decomposition models the underlying distribution of the count\\ndata and guarantees non-negative estimated values and so can be safely used\\ndirectly in entropy estimation. We believe our estimator is the first\\ntensor-based estimator that exploits the underlying spatial Poisson process\\nrelated to the histogram explicitly when estimating the probability density\\nwith low-rank tensor decompositions or tensor completion. Furthermore, we\\ndemonstrate that our PTC estimator is a substantial improvement over standard\\nhistogram-based estimators for sub-Gaussian probability distributions because\\nof the concentration of norm phenomenon.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.ME,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T05:38:59Z\"}"}
