{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05358v1\", \"title\": \"Empirical Analysis of Transaction Conflicts in Ethereum and Solana for\\n  Parallel Execution\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of historical data across two\\npopular blockchain networks: Ethereum and Solana. Our study focuses on two key\\naspects: transaction conflicts and the maximum theoretical parallelism within\\nhistorical blocks. We aim to quantify the degree of transaction parallelism and\\nassess how effectively it can be exploited by systematically examining\\nblock-level characteristics, both within individual blocks and across different\\nhistorical periods. In particular, this study is the first of its kind to\\nleverage historical transactional workloads to evaluate transactional conflict\\npatterns. By offering a structured approach to analyzing these conflicts, our\\nresearch provides valuable insights and an empirical basis for developing more\\nefficient parallel execution techniques in the Ethereum and Solana Virtual\\nMachines. Our empirical analysis reveals that Ethereum blocks frequently\\nachieve high independence$-$over 50\\\\% in more than 50\\\\% of blocks, while Solana\\nblocks contain longer conflict chains, comprising $\\\\sim$59\\\\% of the block size\\ncompared to $\\\\sim$18\\\\% in Ethereum, reflecting fundamentally different parallel\\nexecution dynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC,cs.ET\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:49:49Z\"}"}
