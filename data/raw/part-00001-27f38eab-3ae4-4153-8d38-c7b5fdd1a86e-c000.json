{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01830v1\", \"title\": \"Is Lorentz invariance violation found?\", \"summary\": \"Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) has long been recognized as an observable\\nlow-energy signature of quantum gravity. In spite of a great effort to detect\\nLIV effects, so far only lower bounds have been derived. The high energy\\nphotons from the gamma ray burst GRB 221009A have been detected by the LHAASO\\ncollaboration and one at ${\\\\cal E} \\\\simeq 251 \\\\, \\\\rm TeV$ by the Carpet\\ncollaboration using a partial data set. Very recently, the Carpet collaboration\\nhas completed the full data analysis, reporting further support for their\\npreviously detected photon now at ${\\\\cal E} = 300^{+ 43}_{- 38} \\\\, {\\\\rm TeV}$,\\nwhich manifestly clashes with conventional physics. Taking this result at face\\nvalue, we derive the first evidence for LIV and we show that such a detection\\ncannot be explained by axion-like particles (ALPs), which allow for the\\nobservation of the highest energy photons detected by LHAASO. We also outline a\\nscenario in which ALPs and LIV naturally coexist. If confirmed by future\\nobservations our finding would represent the first positive result in quantum\\ngravity phenomenology.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,gr-qc,hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:39:37Z\"}"}
