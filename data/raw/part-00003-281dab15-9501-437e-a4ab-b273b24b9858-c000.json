The exact form of the three SGN-Whitham modulation equations\\n-- two for the mean horizontal velocity and depth decoupled from one for the\\nsolitary wave amplitude field -- are obtained exactly in the solitary wave\\nlimit. Although the three equations are not diagonalizable, the restriction of\\nthe full system to simple waves for the mean equations is diagonalized in terms\\nof Riemann invariants. The Riemann invariants are used to analytically describe\\nthe head-on and overtaking interactions of a solitary wave with a rarefaction\\nwave and dispersive shock wave (DSW), leading to scenarios of solitary wave\\ntrapping or transmission by the mean flow. The analytical results for\\novertaking interactions prove that a simpler, approximate approach based on the\\nDSW fitting method is accurate to the second order in solitary wave amplitude,\\nbeyond the first order accurate Korteweg-de Vries approximation. The analytical\\nresults also accurately predict the SGN DSW's solitary wave edge amplitude and\\nspeed. The analytical results are favourably compared with corresponding\\nnumerical solutions of the full SGN equations. Because the SGN equations model\\nthe bi-directional propagation of strongly nonlinear, long gravity waves over a\\nflat bottom, the analysis presented here describes large amplitude solitary\\nwave-mean flow interactions in shallow water waves.\", \"main_category\": \"math-ph\", \"categories\": \"math-ph,math.MP,nlin.PS\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T07:28:00Z\"}"}
