Motivated by the challenges arising from both\\nrandomness and nonlinearity, we develop a globally convergent iterative\\nregularization method that combines Carleman estimate with fixed-point\\niteration. Our approach enables the reconstruction of the unknown source\\nfunction from partial lateral Cauchy data, without requiring a good initial\\nguess. We establish a new Carleman estimate for stochastic hyperbolic equations\\nand prove the convergence of the proposed method in weighted spaces.\\nFurthermore, we design an efficient numerical algorithm that avoids solving\\nbackward stochastic partial differential equations and is robust to randomness\\nin both the model and the data. Numerical experiments are provided to\\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the method.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T09:38:57Z\"}"}
