Under very mild assumptions on the coefficients we\\nprove existence, uniqueness and positivity of solutions of a corresponding\\nsemi-linear Cauchy problem in a weighted $\\\\ell^1$ space. This requires the\\napplication of novel results, which we prove for abstract semi-linear Cauchy\\nproblems in Banach lattices where the non-linear term is defined only on a\\ndense subspace.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:09:22Z\"}"}
