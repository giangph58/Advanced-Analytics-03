{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16637v1\", \"title\": \"RouteWinFormer: A Route-Window Transformer for Middle-range Attention in\\n  Image Restoration\", \"summary\": \"Transformer models have recently garnered significant attention in image\\nrestoration due to their ability to capture long-range pixel dependencies.\\nHowever, long-range attention often results in computational overhead without\\npractical necessity, as degradation and context are typically localized.\\nNormalized average attention distance across various degradation datasets shows\\nthat middle-range attention is enough for image restoration. Building on this\\ninsight, we propose RouteWinFormer, a novel window-based Transformer that\\nmodels middle-range context for image restoration. RouteWinFormer incorporates\\nRoute-Windows Attnetion Module, which dynamically selects relevant nearby\\nwindows based on regional similarity for attention aggregation, extending the\\nreceptive field to a mid-range size efficiently. In addition, we introduce\\nMulti-Scale Structure Regularization during training, enabling the sub-scale of\\nthe U-shaped network to focus on structural information, while the\\noriginal-scale learns degradation patterns based on generalized image structure\\npriors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RouteWinFormer outperforms\\nstate-of-the-art methods across 9 datasets in various image restoration tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T11:57:22Z\"}"}
