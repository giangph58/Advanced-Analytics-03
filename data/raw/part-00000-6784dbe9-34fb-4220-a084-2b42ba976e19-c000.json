If a 1-planar graph is drawn in that way, the\\ndrawing is called a {\\\\it 1-plane graph}. A graph is maximal 1-plane (or\\n1-planar) if no additional edge can be added without violating 1-planarity or\\nsimplicity. It is known that any maximal 1-plane graph is $k$-connected for\\nsome $k$ with $2\\\\le k\\\\le 7$. Recently, Huang et al. proved that any maximal\\n1-plane graph with $n$ ($\\\\ge 5$) vertices has at least\\n$\\\\lceil\\\\frac{7}{3}n\\\\rceil-3$ edges, which is tight for all integers $n\\\\ge 5$.\\nIn this paper, we study $k$-connected maximal 1-plane graphs for each $k$ with\\n$3\\\\le k\\\\le 7$, and establish a lower bound for their crossing numbers and a\\nlower bound for their edge numbers, respectively.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T11:57:00Z\"}"}
