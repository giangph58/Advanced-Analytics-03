Traditional methods typically require extensive\\nstress-strain or full-field measurements, which are often difficult to obtain\\nin practical settings. To overcome these challenges, we propose a\\nphysics-informed neural network (PINN)-based framework that enables the\\ndiscovery of constitutive models using only sparse measurement data - such as\\ndisplacement and reaction force - that can be acquired from a single material\\ntest. By integrating PINNs with finite element discretization, the framework\\nreconstructs full-field displacement and identifies the underlying strain\\nenergy density from predefined candidates, while ensuring consistency with\\nphysical laws. A two-stage training process is employed: the Adam optimizer\\njointly updates neural network parameters and model coefficients to obtain an\\ninitial solution, followed by L-BFGS refinement and sparse regression with l_p\\nregularization to extract a parsimonious constitutive model. Validation on\\nbenchmark hyperelastic models demonstrates that the proposed method can\\naccurately recover constitutive laws and displacement fields, even when the\\ninput data are limited and noisy. These findings highlight the applicability of\\nthe proposed framework to experimental scenarios where measurement data are\\nboth scarce and noisy.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T05:27:11Z\"}"}
