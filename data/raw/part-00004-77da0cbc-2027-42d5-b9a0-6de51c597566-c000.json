Thus far, these systems have primarily\\nbeen demonstrated in small-scale implementations, such as Ising Machines for\\nsolving combinatorial problems and associative memories for image recognition,\\ntypically trained without state-of-the-art gradient-based algorithms. Scaling\\nup oscillator-based systems requires advanced gradient-based training methods\\nthat also ensure robustness against frequency dispersion between individual\\noscillators. Here, we demonstrate through simulations that the Equilibrium\\nPropagation algorithm enables effective gradient-based training of oscillator\\nnetworks, facilitating synchronization even when initial oscillator frequencies\\nare significantly dispersed. We specifically investigate two oscillator models:\\npurely phase-coupled oscillators and oscillators coupled via both amplitude and\\nphase interactions. Our results show that these oscillator networks can scale\\nsuccessfully to standard image recognition benchmarks, such as achieving nearly\\n98\\\\% test accuracy on the MNIST dataset, despite noise introduced by imperfect\\nsynchronization. This work thus paves the way for practical hardware\\nimplementations of large-scale oscillator networks, such as those based on\\nspintronic devices.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn,cond-mat.mes-hall,cs.ET\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T09:10:31Z\"}"}
