Evaluating Consequential Greenhouse Gas\\n  Emissions from EV Charging\", \"summary\": \"While electrifying transportation eliminates tailpipe greenhouse gas (GHG)\\nemissions, electric vehicle (EV) adoption can create additional electricity\\nsector emissions. To quantify this emissions impact, prior work typically\\nemploys short-run marginal emissions or average emissions rates calculated from\\nhistorical data or power systems models that do not consider changes in\\ninstalled capacity. In this work, we use an electricity system capacity\\nexpansion model to consider the full consequential GHG emissions impact from\\nlarge-scale EV adoption in the western United States, accounting for induced\\nchanges in generation and storage capacity. We find that the metrics described\\nabove do not accurately reflect the true emissions impact of EV\\nadoption-average emissions rates can either under- or over-estimate emission\\nimpacts, and short-run marginal emissions rates can significantly underestimate\\nemission reductions, especially when charging timing is flexible. Our results\\nalso show that using short-run marginal emission rates as signals to coordinate\\nEV charging could increase emissions relative to price-based charging signals,\\nindicating the need for alternative control strategies to minimize\\nconsequential emissions.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:05:44Z\"}"}
