{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03524v1\", \"title\": \"Experimental Side-Channel-Secure Quantum Key Distribution over 200 km\", \"summary\": \"Quantum key distribution enables two remote parties to share encryption keys\\nwith information-theoretic security based on physical laws. Side-channel-secure\\nquantum key distribution (SCS-QKD) has attracted considerable attention due to\\nits immunity to both source and detector side-channel attacks. Recently, a\\ndemonstration of SCS-QKD over 50 km has been realized. However, practical\\nimplementation of this protocol faces significant challenges, including the\\npresence of an imperfect vacuum state and coherent attacks involving a limited\\nnumber of pulses. Here, based on the theoretical work of Jiang et al. [Phys.\\nRev. Research 6, 013266 (2024)], we experimentally implemented the practical\\nSCS-QKD protocol using an imperfect whole-space source. This allows us to\\nextend the transmission distance to 200 km using fiber spools, achieving a\\nsecure key rate of 1.29E-7 bits per pulse while accounting for finite-key\\neffects. These results establish a new distance record for SCS-QKD and\\nhighlight its potential for practical applications. We anticipate that this\\nwork will advance the practical implementation and security of quantum key\\ndistribution.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T13:36:24Z\"}"}
