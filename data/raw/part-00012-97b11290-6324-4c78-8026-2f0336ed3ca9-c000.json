Here, we\\npresent a method to extract the real-space superconducting order parameter from\\nthe superconducting gap spectrum obtained via anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg\\ncalculations, using the Bloch wave functions of the Fermi states. We apply this\\napproach to a selection of atomically thin material systems. Our analysis of\\ngallenene, a monolayer of gallium atoms, shows that its planar and buckled\\nphases exhibit distinct superconducting order parameter behaviors, shaped by\\ntheir structural and electronic properties. Furthermore, we demonstrate that\\nour real-space approach is exceptionally suited to identify and characterize\\nJosephson junctions made from van der Waals materials. Our examination of a\\nbilayer of NbSe$_2$ reveals that the van der Waals gap acts as an intrinsic\\nweak link between the superconducting NbSe$_2$ layers. Therefore, a bilayer of\\nNbSe$_2$ represents one of the thinnest and most tunable Josephson junction\\narchitectures, with potential applications in quantum devices. Our findings\\nunderscore the utility of transformation into real-space in understanding\\nsuperconducting properties through ab initio calculations.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T16:10:27Z\"}"}
