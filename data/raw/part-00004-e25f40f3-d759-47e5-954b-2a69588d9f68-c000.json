While recent advances have shown promising results\\nin 4D avatar creation, existing methods either require extensive multiview data\\nor struggle with shape accuracy and identity consistency. To address these\\nlimitations, we propose a comprehensive system that leverages shape, image, and\\nvideo priors to create full-view, animatable avatars. Our approach first\\nobtains initial coarse shape through 3D-GAN inversion. Then, it enhances\\nmultiview textures using depth-guided warping signals for cross-view\\nconsistency with the help of the image diffusion model. To handle expression\\nanimation, we incorporate a video prior with synchronized driving signals\\nacross viewpoints. We further introduce a Consistent-Inconsistent training to\\neffectively handle data inconsistencies during 4D reconstruction. Experimental\\nresults demonstrate that our method achieves superior quality compared to the\\nprior art, while maintaining consistency across different viewpoints and\\nexpressions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T15:40:14Z\"}"}
