The mask pattern is represented by\\nperiodic B-spline curves. We apply Delaunay triangulation to discretize the\\ndomains circled by the spline curves. Subsequently, we establish an explicit\\nrelationship between the integral points and the control points of the boundary\\nspline curve. Based on the relationship, we derive explicit formulas of the\\ngradient of the optimization objective function with respect to the coordinates\\nof the control points. Then we propose an inverse lithography algorithm to\\noptimize the curvilinear mask pattern. Finally, the results of the numerical\\nexperiments demonstrate the feasibility and extensive adaptability of our\\nmethod.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T10:44:02Z\"}"}
