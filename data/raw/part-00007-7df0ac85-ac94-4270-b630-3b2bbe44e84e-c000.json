{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17361v1\", \"title\": \"Stellar Physics Across the HR Diagram with Gaia\", \"summary\": \"Gaia Data Release 3 (GDR3) contains a wealth of information to advance our\\nknowledge of stellar physics. In these lecture notes we introduce the data\\nproducts from GDR3 that can be exploited by the stellar physics community. Then\\nwe visit different regions of the HR diagram, discuss the open scientific\\nquestions, and describe how GDR3 can help advance this particular topic.\\nSpecific regions include hot OB and A type stars, FGK main sequence, giants,\\nand variable sources, low mass stars, and ultra-cool dwarfs. Examples of\\nscientific exploitation are also provided. These lecture notes are accompanied\\nby a 3-hour lecture presentation and a 3-hour practical session that are\\npublicly available on the website of the Ecole Evry Schatzman 2023: Stellar\\nphysics with Gaia, https://ees2023.sciencesconf.org/, see Lectures and Hands-on\\nWork.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T08:22:01Z\"}"}
