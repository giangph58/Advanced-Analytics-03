As an\\napplication, we obtain ultra log-concavity and unimodality for the number of\\nBorel orbits in Types AIII and CII. Moreover, we prove a conjecture of Can and\\nUgurlu concerning the non-integrality of the coefficients of the polynomial\\nthat interpolates the number of orbits in Type BI.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,math.RT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T17:20:38Z\"}"}
