This proceedings presents recent results from RHIC and\\nLHC on jet energy loss, acoplanarity, and the flavour and path-length\\ndependence of Parton energy loss, providing critical constraints on QGP\\nproperties and theoretical models. Upcoming data taking campaigns at RHIC and\\nthe LHC will offer enhanced precision and extended kinematic reach to further\\nadvance our understanding of jet-medium interactions.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-ex\", \"categories\": \"nucl-ex,hep-ex,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T11:15:33Z\"}"}
