{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10040v1\", \"title\": \"The Security of Quantum Computing in 6G: from Technical Perspectives to\\n  Ethical Implications\", \"summary\": \"Quantum technologies hold promise as essential components for the upcoming\\ndeployment of the future 6G network. In this future network, the security and\\ntrustworthiness requirements are not considered fulfilled with the current\\nstate of the quantum computers, as the malicious behaviour on the part of the\\nservice provider towards the user may still be present. Therefore, this article\\nprovides an initial interdisciplinary work of regulations and solutions in the\\nscope of trustworthy quantum computing for future 6G that can be viewed as\\ncomplimentary regulations to the existing strategies shared by different actors\\nof states and organizations. More precisely, we describe the importance of a\\nreliable quantum service provider and its implication on the ethical aspects\\nconcerning digital sovereignty. By exploring the critical relationship between\\ntrustworthiness and digital sovereignty in the context of future 6G networks,\\nwe analyse a trade-off between accessibility to this new technology and\\npreservation of digital sovereignty engaging in parallel the United Nation's\\n(UN's) sustainable development goals. Furthermore, we propose a partnership\\nmodel based on cooperation, coordination, and collaboration giving rise to a\\ntrusted, ethical, and inclusive quantum ecosystem, whose implications can spill\\nover to the entire global scenario.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:42:16Z\"}"}
