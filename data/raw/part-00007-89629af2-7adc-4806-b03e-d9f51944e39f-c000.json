{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00627v1\", \"title\": \"Brain Foundation Models with Hypergraph Dynamic Adapter for Brain\\n  Disease Analysis\", \"summary\": \"Brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and brain tumors, present\\nprofound challenges due to their complexity and societal impact. Recent\\nadvancements in brain foundation models have shown significant promise in\\naddressing a range of brain-related tasks. However, current brain foundation\\nmodels are limited by task and data homogeneity, restricted generalization\\nbeyond segmentation or classification, and inefficient adaptation to diverse\\nclinical tasks. In this work, we propose SAM-Brain3D, a brain-specific\\nfoundation model trained on over 66,000 brain image-label pairs across 14 MRI\\nsub-modalities, and Hypergraph Dynamic Adapter (HyDA), a lightweight adapter\\nfor efficient and effective downstream adaptation. SAM-Brain3D captures\\ndetailed brain-specific anatomical and modality priors for segmenting diverse\\nbrain targets and broader downstream tasks. HyDA leverages hypergraphs to fuse\\ncomplementary multi-modal data and dynamically generate patient-specific\\nconvolutional kernels for multi-scale feature fusion and personalized\\npatient-wise adaptation. Together, our framework excels across a broad spectrum\\nof brain disease segmentation and classification tasks. Extensive experiments\\ndemonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art\\napproaches, offering a new paradigm for brain disease analysis through\\nmulti-modal, multi-scale, and dynamic foundation modeling.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T16:06:17Z\"}"}
