{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07852v1\", \"title\": \"The signless Laplacian spectral Tur\\u00e1n problems for color-critical\\n  graphs\", \"summary\": \"The well-known Tur\\\\'{a}n theorem states that if $G$ is an $n$-vertex\\n$K_{r+1}$-free graph, then $e(G)\\\\le e(T_{n,r})$, with equality if and only if\\n$G$ is the $r$-partite Tur\\\\'{a}n graph $T_{n,r}$. A graph $F$ is called\\ncolor-critical if it contains an edge whose deletion reduces its chromatic\\nnumber. Extending the Tur\\\\'{a}n theorem, Simonovits (1968) proved that for any\\ncolor-critical graph $F$ with $\\\\chi (F)=r+1$ and sufficiently large $n$, the\\nTur\\\\'{a}n graph $T_{n,r}$ is the unique graph with maximum number of edges\\namong all $n$-vertex $F$-free graphs. Subsequently, Nikiforov [Electron. J.\\nCombin., 16 (1) (2009)] proved a spectral version of the Simonovits theorem in\\nterms of the adjacency spectral radius. In this paper, we show an extension of\\nthe Simonovits theorem for the signless Laplacian spectral radius. We prove\\nthat for any color-critical graph $F$ with $\\\\chi (F)=r+1\\\\ge 4$ and sufficiently\\nlarge $n$, if $G$ is an $F$-free graph on $n$ vertices, then $q(G)\\\\le\\nq(T_{n,r})$, with equality if and only if $G=T_{n,r}$. Our approach is to\\nestablish a signless Laplacian spectral version of the criterion of Keevash,\\nLenz and Mubayi [SIAM J. Discrete Math., 28 (4) (2014)]. Consequently, we can\\ndetermine the signless Laplacian spectral extremal graphs for generalized books\\nand even wheels. As an application, our result gives an upper bound on the\\ndegree power of an $F$-free graph. We show that if $n$ is sufficiently large\\nand $G$ is an $F$-free graph on $n$ vertices with $m$ edges, then $\\\\sum_{v\\\\in\\nV(G)} d^2(v) \\\\le 2(1- \\\\frac{1}{r})mn$, with equality if and only if $G$ is a\\nregular Tur\\\\'{a}n graph $T_{n,r}$. This extends a result of Nikiforov and\\nRousseau [J. Combin. Theory Ser B 92 (2004)].\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:28:40Z\"}"}
