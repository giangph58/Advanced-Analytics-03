We consider bounds expressed as a function\\nof two quantities: on the one hand, the maximal cutwidth x of the subgraphs\\ninduced by the classes of the partition, and on the other hand, the cutwidth y\\nof the quotient multigraph obtained by merging each class to a single vertex.\\nWe consider in particular decomposition of directed graphs into strongly\\nconnected components (SCCs): in this case, x is the maximal cutwidth of an SCC,\\nand y is the cutwidth of the directed acyclic condensation multigraph.\\n  We show that the cutwidth of a graph is always in O(x + y), specifically it\\ncan be upper bounded by 1.5x + y. We also show a lower bound justifying that\\nthe constant 1.5 cannot be improved in general\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS,cs.DM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T10:23:58Z\"}"}
