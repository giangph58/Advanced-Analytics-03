{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17264v1\", \"title\": \"JurisCTC: Enhancing Legal Judgment Prediction via Cross-Domain Transfer\\n  and Contrastive Learning\", \"summary\": \"In recent years, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has gained significant\\nattention in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) owing to its\\nability to enhance model generalization across diverse domains. However, its\\napplication for knowledge transfer between distinct legal domains remains\\nlargely unexplored. To address the challenges posed by lengthy and complex\\nlegal texts and the limited availability of large-scale annotated datasets, we\\npropose JurisCTC, a novel model designed to improve the accuracy of Legal\\nJudgment Prediction (LJP) tasks. Unlike existing approaches, JurisCTC\\nfacilitates effective knowledge transfer across various legal domains and\\nemploys contrastive learning to distinguish samples from different domains.\\nSpecifically, for the LJP task, we enable knowledge transfer between civil and\\ncriminal law domains. Compared to other models and specific large language\\nmodels (LLMs), JurisCTC demonstrates notable advancements, achieving peak\\naccuracies of 76.59% and 78.83%, respectively.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T05:48:57Z\"}"}
