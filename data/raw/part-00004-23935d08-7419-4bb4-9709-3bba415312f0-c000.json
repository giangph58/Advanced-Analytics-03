{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03315v1\", \"title\": \"Artificial Behavior Intelligence: Technology, Challenges, and Future\\n  Directions\", \"summary\": \"Understanding and predicting human behavior has emerged as a core capability\\nin various AI application domains such as autonomous driving, smart healthcare,\\nsurveillance systems, and social robotics. This paper defines the technical\\nframework of Artificial Behavior Intelligence (ABI), which comprehensively\\nanalyzes and interprets human posture, facial expressions, emotions, behavioral\\nsequences, and contextual cues. It details the essential components of ABI,\\nincluding pose estimation, face and emotion recognition, sequential behavior\\nanalysis, and context-aware modeling. Furthermore, we highlight the\\ntransformative potential of recent advances in large-scale pretrained models,\\nsuch as large language models (LLMs), vision foundation models, and multimodal\\nintegration models, in significantly improving the accuracy and\\ninterpretability of behavior recognition. Our research team has a strong\\ninterest in the ABI domain and is actively conducting research, particularly\\nfocusing on the development of intelligent lightweight models capable of\\nefficiently inferring complex human behaviors. This paper identifies several\\ntechnical challenges that must be addressed to deploy ABI in real-world\\napplications including learning behavioral intelligence from limited data,\\nquantifying uncertainty in complex behavior prediction, and optimizing model\\nstructures for low-power, real-time inference. To tackle these challenges, our\\nteam is exploring various optimization strategies including lightweight\\ntransformers, graph-based recognition architectures, energy-aware loss\\nfunctions, and multimodal knowledge distillation, while validating their\\napplicability in real-time environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:45:44Z\"}"}
