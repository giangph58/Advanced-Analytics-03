This survey reviews studies on trust\\ndynamics in user-VLM interactions, through a multi-disciplinary taxonomy\\nencompassing different cognitive science capabilities, collaboration modes, and\\nagent behaviours. Literature insights and findings from a workshop with\\nprospective VLM users inform preliminary requirements for future VLM trust\\nstudies.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI,cs.CY,cs.HC,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:02:49Z\"}"}
