Firstly, for the transmitting antennas featuring\\nvertical polarization, the polarization characteristic is decomposed along the\\nx, y, and z directions. Three typical cases are studied when the focal points\\nare at (xf , 0, 0), (0, yf , 0), and (0, 0, zf ). When the length of the\\ncylindrical dipole array is significantly larger compared to its radius,\\ncertain unique insights emerge. When the focal point is positioned along (0, 0,\\nzf ), apart from the region on both sides, the ratio between Ez and Ex/Ey\\nremains {\\\\pi}/2. Additionally, When the focal point is located within the\\ncylinder, the electric field of each polarization is approximately the same\\neverywhere. In other words, beam focusing does not incur losses due to\\ndifferent positions. The focusing resolution of Ez is the same in the\\ntransverse and longitudinal directions. Different from the situation where the\\n3 - dB focal beam depth is much smaller than the focal beam width for the most\\nof arrays, the resolution in the longitudinal can be improved, respectively.\\nThrough a comprehensive grasp of these design principles, we can gain a deeper\\nunderstanding of the specific areas with significant potential for practical\\napplications.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T07:16:33Z\"}"}
