{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20436v1\", \"title\": \"Network Attack Traffic Detection With Hybrid Quantum-Enhanced\\n  Convolution Neural Network\", \"summary\": \"The emerging paradigm of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) combines features of\\nquantum computing and machine learning (ML). QML enables the generation and\\nrecognition of statistical data patterns that classical computers and classical\\nML methods struggle to effectively execute. QML utilizes quantum systems to\\nenhance algorithmic computation speed and real-time data processing\\ncapabilities, making it one of the most promising tools in the field of ML.\\nQuantum superposition and entanglement features also hold the promise to\\npotentially expand the potential feature representation capabilities of ML.\\nTherefore, in this study, we explore how quantum computing affects ML and\\nwhether it can further improve the detection performance on network traffic\\ndetection, especially on unseen attacks which are types of malicious traffic\\nthat do not exist in the ML training dataset. Classical ML models often perform\\npoorly in detecting these unseen attacks because they have not been trained on\\nsuch traffic. Hence, this paper focuses on designing and proposing novel hybrid\\nstructures of Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) to achieve the\\ndetection of malicious traffic. The detection performance, generalization, and\\nrobustness of the QML solutions are evaluated and compared with classical ML\\nrunning on classical computers. The emphasis lies in assessing whether the\\nQML-based malicious traffic detection outperforms classical solutions. Based on\\nexperiment results, QCNN models demonstrated superior performance compared to\\nclassical ML approaches on unseen attack detection.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T05:23:27Z\"}"}
