{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16049v1\", \"title\": \"Effect of Coriolis Force on the Shear Viscosity of Rotating Nuclear\\n  Medium\", \"summary\": \"Following the recent observation of non-zero spin polarization and spin\\nalignment of a few hadrons, the rotational aspect of quark-gluon plasma formed\\nin heavy ion collisions has attracted considerable interest. The present work\\nexplores the effect of the Coriolis force, arising due to this rotation, on the\\nshear viscosity of the medium. Using the relaxation time approximation within\\nthe kinetic theory framework, we analyze the parallel (\\\\(\\\\eta_{||}/s\\\\)),\\nperpendicular (\\\\(\\\\eta_\\\\perp/s\\\\)) and Hall (\\\\(\\\\eta_\\\\times/s\\\\)) components of\\nshear viscosity to entropy density ratio under rotation. The estimation of\\nanisotropic shear viscosity components is carried out using hadron resonance\\ngas degrees of freedom below the critical (transition) temperature and massless\\npartonic degrees of freedom above this temperature. Our results show that\\nrotation suppresses the shear viscosity of the medium, with the degree of\\nsuppression depending on the ratio between the relaxation time and the\\nrotational period. In the context of realistic heavy-ion collision experiments,\\nthe temperature and angular velocity both decrease with time, and one can\\nestablish a connection between them through the standard approximate cooling\\nlaw. For a temperature-dependent angular velocity \\\\(\\\\Omega(T)\\\\), we obtain a\\ntraditional valley-like pattern for all components \\\\(\\\\eta_{||}/s\\\\),\\n\\\\(\\\\eta_\\\\perp/s\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\eta_\\\\times/s\\\\) with reduced magnitudes compared to the\\nvalley-like isotropic $\\\\eta/s$ one encounters in the absence of rotation.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T17:27:10Z\"}"}
