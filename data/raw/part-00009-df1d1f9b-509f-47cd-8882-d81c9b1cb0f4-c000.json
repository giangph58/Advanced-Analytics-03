By extending the logarithmic signature to\\nencompass the entire group and modifying the encryption algorithm, we have\\ndeveloped robust protection against sequential key recovery attacks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,math.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T07:51:56Z\"}"}
