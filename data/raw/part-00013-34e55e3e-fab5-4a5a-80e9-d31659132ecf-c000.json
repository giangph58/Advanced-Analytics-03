I discuss an approach based on the holographic\\nV-QCD model, which includes both nuclear and quark matter phases, separated by\\na first order phase transition. By using this model in state-of-the-art\\nsimulations of neutron star binaries, I study the formation of quark matter\\nduring the merger process, and its effect on the threshold mass for prompt\\ncollapse into a black hole.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T09:29:59Z\"}"}
