This regime is characterized by restricted excitation\\noccurrences and a highly nonclassical stable state of the self-oscillating\\nsystem. However, many existing approaches to observe synchronization in this\\nquantum realm face a major challenge: the influence of noise tends to\\novershadow the synchronization phenomenon. In coupled van der Pol oscillators,\\nsynchronization occurs when a system of two or more oscillators interacts. Our\\ninvestigation demonstrates that introducing the squeezing Hamiltonian in two\\ncoupled van der Pol oscillators enhances nonclassical effects, increases\\nquantum correlations, and improves the robustness of synchronization dynamics.\\nThis was evidenced through the analysis of the Wigner function and power\\nspectrum, showing significant improvements compared to systems without\\nsqueezing.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:33:05Z\"}"}
