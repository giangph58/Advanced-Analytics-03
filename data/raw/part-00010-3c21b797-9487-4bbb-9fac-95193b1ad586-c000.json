{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20457v1\", \"title\": \"Modular Channels, Thermal Filtering and the Spectral Emergence of\\n  Spacetime\", \"summary\": \"We investigate the information-theoretic structure underlying causal horizons\\nthrough the formalism of modular quantum channels. By analyzing the singular\\nvalue decomposition of the channel induced by the partial trace over\\ninaccessible regions, we show that the Unruh effect and the Page curve can be\\nunderstood as manifestations of a universal thermal filtering mechanism\\ngoverned by the modular Hamiltonian. This structure leads to a Gibbs-weighted\\nhierarchy of information transmission modes, with entanglement entropy\\ncorresponding to spectral activation and thermal capacity.\\n  We reinterpret the first law of entanglement as a Clausius relation for\\nmodular flow and derive Einstein's equations by requiring its local validity\\nacross Rindler horizons. In the case of black hole evaporation, we find that\\nthe modular channel undergoes an informational phase transition at the Page\\ntime, marked by a shift from entanglement preservation to recoverability,\\nquantified through fidelity and channel capacity.\\n  Based on these results, we propose the Modular Channels Flow Correspondence\\n(MCFC): a minimal holographic principle whereby the area of a causal screen\\nmeasures the storage of filtered quantum information. Our framework offers a\\nunified operational account of holography, entropy, and curvature, grounded in\\nthe spectral dynamics of modular channels.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T06:35:15Z\"}"}
