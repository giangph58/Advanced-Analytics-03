{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00464v1\", \"title\": \"Stable self-charged perovskite quantum rods for liquid laser with\\n  near-zero threshold\", \"summary\": \"Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are promising optical gain materials that\\nrequire further threshold reduction to realize their full potential. While QD\\ncharging theoretically reduces the threshold to zero, its effectiveness has\\nbeen limited by strong Auger recombination and unstable charging. Here we\\ntheoretically reveal the optimal combination of charging number and Auger\\nrecombination to minimize the lasing threshold. Experimentally, we develop\\nstable self-charged perovskite quantum rods (QRs) as an alternative to QDs via\\nstate engineering and Mn-doping strategy. An unprecedented\\ntwo-order-of-magnitude reduction in nonradiative Auger recombination enables\\nQRs to support a sufficient charging number of up to 6. The QR liquid lasing is\\nthen achieved with a near-zero threshold of 0.098 using quasi-continuous\\npumping of nanosecond pulses, which is the lowest threshold among all reported\\nQD lasers. These achievements demonstrate the potential of the specially\\nengineered QRs as an excellent gain media and pave the way for their\\nprospective applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,physics.app-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T11:31:09Z\"}"}
