The\\nobserved deviations from this paradigm are properly treated by an interacting\\nboson model Hamiltonian which breaks the U(5) symmetry in selected non-yrast\\nstates, while securing a weak mixing with coexisting SO(6)-like intruder\\nstates. The results demonstrate the relevance of the U(5) partial dynamical\\nsymmetry notion to this series of isotopes.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:53:30Z\"}"}
