By\\nvarying the fluid viscosity, shear rate, and granular pressure, we find that\\nthe transition is independent of the packing fraction and occurs at a Stokes\\nnumber of 10. Our results reveal that the shear stress exhibits a slower\\ntransition than the particle pressure, attributed to the combined effect of\\ntangential contact and lubrication forces, as the frictional particles\\nconcurrently shift from rolling to sliding contacts. This shift is controlled\\nby the Stokes number but also by the distance from jamming. Additionally, we\\nexamine the role of increasing inter-particle friction on the viscous-inertial\\ntransition.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:47:21Z\"}"}
