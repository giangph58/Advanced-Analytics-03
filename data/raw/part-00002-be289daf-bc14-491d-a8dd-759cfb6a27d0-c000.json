Our main result is a BLT inversion theorem: the\\ninverse of a BLT matrix is itself a BLT matrix with different parameters. We\\nalso present an efficient and differentiable $O(d^3)$ algorithm to compute the\\nparameters of the inverse BLT matrix, where $d$ is the degree of the original\\nBLT (typically $d < 10$). Our characterization enables direct optimization of\\nBLT parameters for privacy mechanisms through automatic differentiation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T08:14:09Z\"}"}
