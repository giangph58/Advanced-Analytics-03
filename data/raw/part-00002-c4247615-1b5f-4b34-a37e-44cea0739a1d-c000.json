However, finding optimal\\ncompositions is non-trivial. In addition, different compositions require\\ndifferent base positions and trajectories to fully use the potential of modular\\nrobots. We address this problem holistically for the first time by jointly\\noptimizing the composition, base placement, and trajectory, to minimize the\\ncycle time of a given task. Our approach is evaluated on over 300 industrial\\nbenchmarks requiring point-to-point movements. Overall, we reduce cycle time by\\nup to 25% and find feasible solutions in twice as many benchmarks compared to\\noptimizing the module composition alone. In the first real-world validation of\\nmodular robots optimized for point-to-point movement, we find that the\\noptimized robot is successfully deployed in nine out of ten cases in less than\\nan hour.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T08:43:58Z\"}"}
