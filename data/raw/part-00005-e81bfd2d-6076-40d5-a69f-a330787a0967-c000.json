This pursuit plays a pivotal\\nrole in advancing our knowledge of QCD and critically evaluating the robustness\\nand accuracy of the theoretical models developed to date. Furthermore,\\ndeciphering the underlying mechanisms of exotic states, both those currently\\nobserved and those anticipated in future experiments, remains a pressing and\\nunresolved challenge. Motivated by this, in the present study, we investigate\\nthe electromagnetic properties of the $D \\\\bar D_1(2420)$ and $D^* \\\\bar\\nD^*(2400)$ molecular tetraquark states with quantum numbers $J^{PC} = 1^{--}$,\\nusing the QCD light-cone sum rule method. These states are analyzed within a\\nhadronic molecular framework, where their magnetic and quadrupole moments are\\ncomputed to probe internal structure and geometric deformation. Our results\\nreveal distinct electromagnetic signatures, with the magnetic moments primarily\\ndominated by light-quark contributions, and the quadrupole moments suggesting\\nan oblate charge distribution. The findings are compared with prior studies\\nassuming compact tetraquark configurations, emphasizing the sensitivity of\\nelectromagnetic observables to the underlying hadronic structure. This analysis\\nprovides critical insights into the nature of exotic hadrons and contributes to\\nthe broader understanding of QCD dynamics in the non-perturbative regime.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex,hep-lat\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T06:41:44Z\"}"}
