The procedure that determines $p,q$ is proposed, and the\\ncharacteristic solvability conditions on $r$ are provided.\\n  Our approach is purely time-domain and is based on studying the\\ncontrollability properties of the Dirac system. In itself the system is not\\ncontrollable: the local completeness of states does not hold, but its relevant\\nextension gains controllability. It is the fact, which enables one to apply the\\nboundary control method for solving the inverse problem.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T11:21:47Z\"}"}
