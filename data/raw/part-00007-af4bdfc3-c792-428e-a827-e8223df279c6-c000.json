If the rational\\nrelation is the graph of a function, this function is said to be rational. The\\nclass of sequential functions is a strict subclass of rational functions,\\ndefined as the functions recognised by input-deterministic finite state\\ntransducers. The class membership problems between those classes are known to\\nbe decidable. We consider approximate versions of these problems and show they\\nare decidable as well. This includes the approximate functionality problem,\\nwhich asks whether given a rational relation (by a transducer), is it close to\\na rational function, and the approximate determinisation problem, which asks\\nwhether a given rational function is close to a sequential function. We prove\\ndecidability results for several classical distances, including Hamming and\\nLevenshtein edit distance. Finally, we investigate the approximate\\nuniformisation problem, which asks, given a rational relation $R$, whether\\nthere exists a sequential function that is close to some function uniformising\\n$R$. As for its exact version, we prove that this problem is undecidable.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.FL\", \"categories\": \"cs.FL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T06:48:50Z\"}"}
