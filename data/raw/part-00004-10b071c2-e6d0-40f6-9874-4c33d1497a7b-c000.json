{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00537v1\", \"title\": \"Local Information Flow in Quantum Quench Dynamics\", \"summary\": \"We investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum information in\\none-dimensional systems undergoing a quantum quench using a local perspective\\nbased on the information lattice. This framework provides a scale- and\\nspace-resolved decomposition of quantum correlations, enabling a hydrodynamic\\ndescription of the information flow through well-defined local densities --\\ntermed local information -- and currents. We apply this framework to three\\nlocal quenches in noninteracting fermionic chains: (i) the release of a single\\nparticle into an empty tight-binding chain, (ii) the connection of two critical\\nchains via the removal of a central barrier, and (iii) the coupling of a\\ntopological Kitaev chain to a critical chain. In each case, the information\\nlattice reveals the local structure of correlation buildup and information\\ninterface effects, going beyond global measures such as the von Neumann\\nentropy. In particular, through the information lattice we uncover the\\nsignatures in the local information flow associated with topological edge modes\\nand analytically explain the fractional von Neumann entropy values observed in\\nMajorana quench protocols. Our approach is general and applicable to\\ninteracting, disordered, and open systems, providing a powerful tool for\\ncharacterizing quantum information dynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T14:04:27Z\"}"}
