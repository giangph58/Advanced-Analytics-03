Accurately determining distortion parameters\\ntypically requires either 1) solving the full Structure from Motion (SfM)\\nproblem involving camera poses, 3D points, and the distortion parameters, which\\nis only possible if many images with sufficient overlap are provided, or 2)\\nrelying heavily on learning-based methods that are comparatively less accurate.\\nIn this work, we demonstrate that distortion calibration can be decoupled from\\n3D reconstruction, maintaining the accuracy of SfM-based methods while avoiding\\nmany of the associated complexities. This is achieved by working in Projective\\nSpace, where the geometry is unique up to a homography, which encapsulates all\\ncamera parameters except for distortion. Our proposed method, Projective Radial\\nDistortion Averaging, averages multiple distortion estimates in a fully\\nprojective framework without creating 3d points and full bundle adjustment. By\\nrelying on pairwise projective relations, our methods support any\\nfeature-matching approaches without constructing point tracks across multiple\\nimages.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T08:22:59Z\"}"}
