{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10229v1\", \"title\": \"ROSFD: Robust Online Streaming Fraud Detection with Resilience to\\n  Concept Drift in Data Streams\", \"summary\": \"Continuous generation of streaming data from diverse sources, such as online\\ntransactions and digital interactions, necessitates timely fraud detection.\\nTraditional batch processing methods often struggle to capture the rapidly\\nevolving patterns of fraudulent activities. This paper highlights the critical\\nimportance of processing streaming data for effective fraud detection. To\\naddress the inherent challenges of latency, scalability, and concept drift in\\nstreaming environments, we propose a robust online streaming fraud detection\\n(ROSFD) framework. Our proposed framework comprises two key stages: (i) Stage\\nOne: Offline Model Initialization. In this initial stage, a model is built in\\noffline settings using incremental learning principles to overcome the\\n\\\"cold-start\\\" problem. (ii) Stage Two: Real-time Model Adaptation. In this\\ndynamic stage, drift detection algorithms (viz.,, DDM, EDDM, and ADWIN) are\\nemployed to identify concept drift in the incoming data stream and\\nincrementally train the model accordingly. This \\\"train-only-when-required\\\"\\nstrategy drastically reduces the number of retrains needed without\\nsignificantly impacting the area under the receiver operating characteristic\\ncurve (AUC). Overall, ROSFD utilizing ADWIN as the drift detection method\\ndemonstrated the best performance among the employed methods. In terms of model\\nefficacy, Adaptive Random Forest consistently outperformed other models,\\nachieving the highest AUC in four out of five datasets.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T13:50:23Z\"}"}
