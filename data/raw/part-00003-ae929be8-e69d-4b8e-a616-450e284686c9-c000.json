Both of these results fail\\nwithout the assumption of convexity. In the environment under study,\\npreferences are convex if and only if they are single peaked. Any individually\\nrational and convex roommate problem is homomorphic to a marriage market where\\nan agent's gender corresponds to the direction of the agent's top-ranked\\npartner. The existence of stable matchings then follows from the existence of\\nstable matchings in marriage markets. To prove the second existence result, I\\ndefine an efficient, individually rational, and strategyproof mechanism for\\nconvex roommate problems. To calculate outcomes, this mechanism starts with all\\nagents being single and then gradually reassigns agents to better partners by\\nperforming minimal Pareto improvements. Whenever it becomes clear that some\\nagent cannot be part of any further Pareto improvement, such an agent is\\nmatched.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.TH\", \"categories\": \"econ.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T12:36:48Z\"}"}
