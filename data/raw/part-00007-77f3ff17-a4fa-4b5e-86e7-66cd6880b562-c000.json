{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16589v1\", \"title\": \"More on genuine multi-entropy and holography\", \"summary\": \"By generalizing the construction of genuine multi-entropy ${\\\\rm\\nGM}[\\\\mathtt{q}]$ for genuine multi-partite entanglement proposed in the\\nprevious paper arXiv:2504.01625, we give a prescription on how to construct\\n${\\\\rm GM}[\\\\mathtt{q}]$ systematically for any $\\\\mathtt{q}$. The crucial point\\nis that our construction naturally fits to the partition number $p(\\\\mathtt{a})$\\nof integer $\\\\mathtt{a}$. For general $\\\\mathtt{q}$, ${\\\\rm GM}[\\\\mathtt{q}]$\\ncontains $N (\\\\mathtt{q}) = p(\\\\mathtt{q})-p(\\\\mathtt{q}-1)-1$ number of free\\nparameters. Furthermore, these give $N (\\\\mathtt{q})+1$ number of new\\ndiagnostics for genuine $\\\\mathtt{q}$-partite entanglement. Especially for\\n$\\\\mathtt{q}=4$ case, this reproduces not only the known diagnostics pointed out\\nby arXiv:1406.2663, but also a new diagnostics for quadripartite entanglement.\\nWe also study these ${\\\\rm GM}[\\\\mathtt{q}]$ for $\\\\mathtt{q} = 4, 5$ in\\nholography and show that these are of the order of ${\\\\cal{O}}\\\\left(1/G_N\\n\\\\right)$ both analytically and numerically. Our results give evidence that\\ngenuine multipartite entanglement is ubiquitous in holography. We discuss the\\nconnection to quantum error correction and the role of genuine multipartite\\nentanglement in bulk reconstruction.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,gr-qc,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T10:13:10Z\"}"}
