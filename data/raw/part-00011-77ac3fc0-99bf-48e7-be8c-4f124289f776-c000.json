{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10232v1\", \"title\": \"Fairness and Efficiency in Two-Sided Matching Markets\", \"summary\": \"We propose a new fairness notion, motivated by the practical challenge of\\nallocating teaching assistants (TAs) to courses in a department. Each course\\nrequires a certain number of TAs and each TA has preferences over the courses\\nthey want to assist. Similarly, each course instructor has preferences over the\\nTAs who applied for their course. We demand fairness and efficiency for both\\nsides separately, giving rise to the following criteria: (i) every course gets\\nthe required number of TAs and the average utility of the assigned TAs meets a\\nthreshold; (ii) the allocation of courses to TAs is envy-free, where a TA\\nenvies another TA if the former prefers the latter's course and has a higher or\\nequal grade in that course. Note that the definition of envy-freeness here\\ndiffers from the one in the literature, and we call it merit-based\\nenvy-freeness.\\n  We show that the problem of finding a merit-based envy-free and efficient\\nmatching is NP-hard even for very restricted settings, such as two courses and\\nuniform valuations; constant degree, constant capacity of TAs for every course,\\nvaluations in the range {0,1,2,3}, identical valuations from TAs, and even\\nmore. To find tractable results, we consider some restricted instances, such\\nas, strict valuation of TAs for courses, the difference between the number of\\npositively valued TAs for a course and the capacity, the number of positively\\nvalued TAs/courses, types of valuation functions, and obtained some\\npolynomial-time solvable cases, showing the contrast with intractable results.\\nWe further studied the problem in the paradigm of parameterized algorithms and\\ndesigned some exact and approximation algorithms.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GT\", \"categories\": \"cs.GT,cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T13:52:44Z\"}"}
