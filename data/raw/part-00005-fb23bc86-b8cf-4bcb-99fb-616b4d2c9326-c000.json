Variations in these conditions influence\\nits habitability and contribute to its radio emissions. Our objective is to\\nanalyze the response of different terrestrial magnetosphere structures of\\nTRAPPIST-1e to various space weather conditions, including events analogous to\\ncoronal mass ejections (CMEs). We assess its habitability by computing the\\nmagnetopause standoff distance and predict the resulting radio emissions using\\nscaling laws. This study provides some priors for future radio observations. We\\nperform three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the\\nTRAPPIST-1e system using the PLUTO code in spherical coordinates. Our analysis\\nindicates that the predicted habitability and radio emission of TRAPPIST-1e\\nstrongly depend on the planet's magnetic field intensity and magnetic axis\\ninclination. Within sub-Alfvenic, super-Alfvenic, and transitional stellar wind\\nregimes, the radio emission intensity positively correlates with both planetary\\nmagnetic field strength and axial tilt, while planetary habitability,\\nquantified by the magnetopause standoff distance, shows a positive correlation\\nwith magnetic field strength and a negative correlation with magnetic axis\\ntilt...\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T12:28:26Z\"}"}
