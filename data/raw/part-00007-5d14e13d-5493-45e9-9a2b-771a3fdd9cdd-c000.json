This paper\\ndevelops a fast and accurate numerical scheme for approximation of functions on\\n$\\\\mathbb{Z}^2\\\\backslash SE(2)$. We address finite Fourier series of functions\\non the right coset space $\\\\mathbb{Z}^2\\\\backslash SE(2)$ using finite Fourier\\ncoefficients. The convergence/error analysis of finite Fourier coefficients are\\ninvestigated. Conditions are established for the finite Fourier coefficients to\\nconverge to the Fourier coefficients. The matrix forms of the finite transforms\\nare discussed. The implementation of the discrete method to compute numerical\\napproximation of $SE(2)$-convolutions with functions which are radial in\\ntranslations are considered. The paper is concluded by discussing capability of\\nthe numerical scheme to develop fast algorithms for approximating multiple\\nconvolutions with functions with are radial in translations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA,math.FA,math.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:56:32Z\"}"}
