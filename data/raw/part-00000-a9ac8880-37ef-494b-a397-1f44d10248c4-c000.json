{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01851v1\", \"title\": \"Virtual Target Trajectory Prediction for Stochastic Targets\", \"summary\": \"Trajectory prediction of other vehicles is crucial for autonomous vehicles,\\nwith applications from missile guidance to UAV collision avoidance. Typically,\\ntarget trajectories are assumed deterministic, but real-world aerial vehicles\\nexhibit stochastic behavior, such as evasive maneuvers or gliders circling in\\nthermals. This paper uses Conditional Normalizing Flows, an unsupervised\\nMachine Learning technique, to learn and predict the stochastic behavior of\\ntargets of guided missiles using trajectory data. The trained model predicts\\nthe distribution of future target positions based on initial conditions and\\nparameters of the dynamics. Samples from this distribution are clustered using\\na time series k-means algorithm to generate representative trajectories, termed\\nvirtual targets. The method is fast and target-agnostic, requiring only\\ntraining data in the form of target trajectories. Thus, it serves as a drop-in\\nreplacement for deterministic trajectory predictions in guidance laws and path\\nplanning. Simulated scenarios demonstrate the approach's effectiveness for\\naerial vehicles with random maneuvers, bridging the gap between deterministic\\npredictions and stochastic reality, advancing guidance and control algorithms\\nfor autonomous vehicles.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T16:02:43Z\"}"}
