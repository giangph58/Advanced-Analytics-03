In this paper, we propose a\\nnovel method for robotic garment manipulation that significantly improves the\\naccuracy while reducing computational time compared to previous approaches. Our\\nmethod features an action generator that directly interprets scene images and\\ngenerates pixel-wise end-effector action vectors using a neural network. The\\nnetwork also predicts a manipulation score map that ranks potential actions,\\nallowing the system to select the most effective action. Extensive simulation\\nexperiments demonstrate that our method achieves higher unfolding and alignment\\nperformances and faster computation time than previous approaches. Real-world\\nexperiments show that the proposed method generalizes well to different garment\\ntypes and successfully flattens garments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T13:47:51Z\"}"}
