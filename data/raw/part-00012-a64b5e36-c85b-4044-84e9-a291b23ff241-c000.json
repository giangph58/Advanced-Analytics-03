{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16782v1\", \"title\": \"Graph2Nav: 3D Object-Relation Graph Generation to Robot Navigation\", \"summary\": \"We propose Graph2Nav, a real-time 3D object-relation graph generation\\nframework, for autonomous navigation in the real world. Our framework fully\\ngenerates and exploits both 3D objects and a rich set of semantic relationships\\namong objects in a 3D layered scene graph, which is applicable to both indoor\\nand outdoor scenes. It learns to generate 3D semantic relations among objects,\\nby leveraging and advancing state-of-the-art 2D panoptic scene graph works into\\nthe 3D world via 3D semantic mapping techniques. This approach avoids previous\\ntraining data constraints in learning 3D scene graphs directly from 3D data. We\\nconduct experiments to validate the accuracy in locating 3D objects and\\nlabeling object-relations in our 3D scene graphs. We also evaluate the impact\\nof Graph2Nav via integration with SayNav, a state-of-the-art planner based on\\nlarge language models, on an unmanned ground robot to object search tasks in\\nreal environments. Our results demonstrate that modeling object relations in\\nour scene graphs improves search efficiency in these navigation tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T14:58:56Z\"}"}
