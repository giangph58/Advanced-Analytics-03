We also present a faster randomized algorithm against\\nan adaptive adversary with $\\\\tilde{O}(n^{3/4})$ amortized update time.\\n  Our approach employs the edge degree constrained subgraph (EDCS), a central\\nobject for optimizing approximation ratio, in a completely novel way; we\\ninstead use it for maintaining a matching that matches all high degree vertices\\nin sublinear update time so that it remains to handle low degree vertices\\nrather straightforwardly. To optimize this approach, we employ tools never used\\nin the dynamic matching literature prior to our work, including sublinear-time\\nalgorithms for matching high degree vertices, random walks on directed\\nexpanders, and the monotone Even-Shiloach tree for dynamic shortest paths.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:59:33Z\"}"}
