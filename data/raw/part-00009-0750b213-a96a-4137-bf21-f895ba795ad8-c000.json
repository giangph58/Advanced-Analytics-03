{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20766v1\", \"title\": \"The specific heat anomaly stems from a third-order phase transition in\\n  the 2D lattice sine-Gordon model\", \"summary\": \"The specific heat anomaly (SHA) is broadly observed in statistical mechanics,\\nappearing as a smooth, system-size-independent peak in the specific heat, in\\ncontrast to the singular behavior typical of second-order phase transitions\\n(PTs). Its origin remains heavily debated: some attribute it to finite-size\\neffects, others to unidentified phase transitions. Here we investigate SHA\\nusing the two-dimensional sine-Gordon (2D-sG) model and microcanonical\\ninflection point analysis (MIPA), uncovering two key results. First, we show\\nthat the roughening transition in the 2D-sG model is a genuine third-order PT\\nunder MIPA, where the standard thermodynamic quantities remain continuous. This\\nclarifies the ambiguity in the literature, where this transition was often,\\nthough inconclusively, attributed to a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)\\ntransition. Through the use of MIPA and a comprehensive analysis of standard\\nthermodynamic observables, we provide a coherent thermodynamic characterization\\nthat redefines the nature of this transition. Second, we find that the SHA is\\nnot itself a PT but rather the thermodynamic fingerprint of this third-order\\ntransition. These findings clarify the nature of SHA within the 2D-sG model and\\nsuggest that similar anomalies in other systems, such as the XY model, may\\nlikewise originate from third-order PTs, rather than mere crossovers. Our\\nresults provide a consistent thermodynamic interpretation of the SHA and\\nhighlight the broader relevance of third-order transitions in systems\\npreviously thought to exhibit only low-order or crossover transition.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:45:47Z\"}"}
