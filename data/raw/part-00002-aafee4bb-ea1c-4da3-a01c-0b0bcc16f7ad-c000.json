Given a semiorthogonal\\ndecomposition on a category with a special kind of metric, which we call a\\ncompressible metric, we can construct new semiorthogonal decomposition on a\\ncategory constructed from the given one using the aforementioned metric. In the\\nalgebro-geometric setting, this gives us a way of producing new semiorthogonal\\ndecompositions on various small triangulated categories associated to a scheme,\\nif we are given one. In the general setting, the work is related to that of\\nSun-Zhang, while its applications to algebraic geometry are related to the work\\nof Bondarko and Kuznetsov-Shinder.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG,math.CT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T05:24:55Z\"}"}
