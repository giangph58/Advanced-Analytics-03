We extracted star-forming complexes (SFCs) from H$\\\\alpha$ VLT/MUSE and\\nUVIT (FUV and NUV) observations of NGC 628 and used ALMA observations to define\\nthe molecular gas distribution. We find that the extinction-corrected H$\\\\alpha$\\nand FUV luminosities correlate well. Using the fact that O stars have a shorter\\nlifetime (10$^7$ yr) compared to B stars (10$^8$ yr), we estimated the\\napproximate number of O stars from H$\\\\alpha$ emission, and the number of B0\\n($M_{*} > 10 M_{\\\\odot}$), and B1 ($10 M_{\\\\odot} \\\\geq M_{*} \\\\geq 3 M_{\\\\odot}$)\\nstars using FUV, NUV observations. We derived the IMF index ($\\\\alpha$) for\\ndifferent regions using O to B0 ($\\\\alpha_{1}$) and B0 to B1 ($\\\\alpha_{2}$)\\nstellar ratios. Our findings indicate that if we assume H$\\\\alpha$ arises only\\nfrom O8-type stars, the resulting $\\\\alpha_{1}$ value is consistent with the\\ncanonical IMF index. It steepens when we assume O stars with masses up to 100\\n$M_{\\\\odot}$ with mean $\\\\alpha_{1}= 3.16 \\\\pm 0.62$. However, the $\\\\alpha_{2}$\\ndoes not change for large variations in the O-star population, and the mean\\n$\\\\alpha= 2.64 \\\\pm 0.14$. When we include only blue SFCs ($ FUV-NUV\\\\leq0.3$),\\nmean $\\\\alpha_{2}$ is $2.43 \\\\pm 0.06$. The IMF variation for SFCs in arms and\\nspurs is insignificant. We also find that $\\\\alpha_{2}$ correlates with\\ndifferent properties of the SFCs, the most prominent being the\\nextinction-corrected UV color (FUV-NUV).\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T06:40:21Z\"}"}
