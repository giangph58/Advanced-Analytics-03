The DESI baryon\\nacoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements are well described by a flat\\n$\\\\Lambda$CDM model, but the preferred parameters are in mild ($2.3\\\\sigma$)\\ntension with those determined from the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The\\nDESI collaboration has already explored a variety of solutions to this tension\\nrelying on variations in the late-time evolution of dark energy. Here we test\\nan alternative -- the introduction of an ``early dark energy'' (EDE) component.\\nWe find that EDE models can alleviate the tension, though they lead to\\ndifferences in other cosmological parameters that have observational\\nimplications. Particularly the EDE models that fit the acoustic datasets prefer\\nlower $\\\\Omega_m$, higher $H_0$, $n_s$ and $\\\\sigma_8$ in contrast to the\\nlate-time solutions. We discuss the current status and near-future prospects\\nfor distinguishing amongst these solutions.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:26:10Z\"}"}
