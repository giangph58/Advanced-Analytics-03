The goal is to identify a subdomain within a multidimensional set. The\\nnon-homogeneous part of the equation is expressed as a function of separate\\nspace and time variables. We establish uniqueness results by incorporating\\nobservations that can be on the boundary or in an interior domain. Through this\\nprocess, we also derive information about the initial data. The main tools\\nrequired for the proofs include unique continuation, time analyticity of the\\nsolutions and semigroup theory.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T14:01:13Z\"}"}
