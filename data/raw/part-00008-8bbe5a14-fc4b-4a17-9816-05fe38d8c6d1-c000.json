{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11838v1\", \"title\": \"A Visual RAG Pipeline for Few-Shot Fine-Grained Product Classification\", \"summary\": \"Despite the rapid evolution of learning and computer vision algorithms,\\nFine-Grained Classification (FGC) still poses an open problem in many\\npractically relevant applications. In the retail domain, for example, the\\nidentification of fast changing and visually highly similar products and their\\nproperties are key to automated price-monitoring and product recommendation.\\nThis paper presents a novel Visual RAG pipeline that combines the Retrieval\\nAugmented Generation (RAG) approach and Vision Language Models (VLMs) for\\nfew-shot FGC. This Visual RAG pipeline extracts product and promotion data in\\nadvertisement leaflets from various retailers and simultaneously predicts\\nfine-grained product ids along with price and discount information. Compared to\\nprevious approaches, the key characteristic of the Visual RAG pipeline is that\\nit allows the prediction of novel products without re-training, simply by\\nadding a few class samples to the RAG database. Comparing several VLM back-ends\\nlike GPT-4o [23], GPT-4o-mini [24], and Gemini 2.0 Flash [10], our approach\\nachieves 86.8% accuracy on a diverse dataset.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T07:53:50Z\"}"}
