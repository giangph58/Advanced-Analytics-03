{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07726v1\", \"title\": \"Quantum Machine Learning: Unveiling Trends, Impacts through Bibliometric\\n  Analysis\", \"summary\": \"Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is the intersection of two revolutionary\\nfields: quantum computing and machine learning. It promises to unlock\\nunparalleled capabilities in data analysis, model building, and problem-solving\\nby harnessing the unique properties of quantum mechanics. This research\\nendeavors to conduct a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of scientific\\ninformation pertaining to QML covering the period from 2000 to 2023. An\\nextensive dataset comprising 9493 scholarly works is meticulously examined to\\nunveil notable trends, impact factors, and funding patterns within the domain.\\nAdditionally, the study employs bibliometric mapping techniques to visually\\nillustrate the network relationships among key countries, institutions,\\nauthors, patent citations and significant keywords in QML research. The\\nanalysis reveals a consistent growth in publications over the examined period.\\nThe findings highlight the United States and China as prominent contributors,\\nexhibiting substantial publication and citation metrics. Notably, the study\\nconcludes that QML, as a research subject, is currently in a formative stage,\\ncharacterized by robust scholarly activity and ongoing development.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DL\", \"categories\": \"cs.DL,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T13:18:48Z\"}"}
