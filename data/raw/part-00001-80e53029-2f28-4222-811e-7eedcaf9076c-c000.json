The model has an invariable mobility edge that\\nseparates the extended states from the localized states. At the mobility edge,\\nthe wave function presents critical characteristics, which can be verified by\\nfinite-size scaling analysis. Our numerical investigations demonstrate that the\\nextended, critical, and localized states can be effectively distinguished via\\ntheir phase space representation, specially the Wigner distribution. Based on\\nthe Wigner distribution function, we can further obtain the corresponding\\nWigner entropy and employ the feature that the critical state has the maximum\\nWigner entropy to locate the invariable mobility edge. Finally, we reveal that\\nthere are anomalous transport phenomena between the transition from ballistic\\ntransport to the absence of diffusion.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T07:12:17Z\"}"}
