{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15673v1\", \"title\": \"Emergent epithelial elasticity governed by interfacial surface mechanics\\n  and substrate interaction\", \"summary\": \"During the life of animals, epithelial tissues undergo extensive\\ndeformations--first to form organs during embryogensis and later to preserve\\nintegrity and function in adulthood. To what extent these deformations resemble\\nthat of non-living elastic materials is not well understood. We derive an\\nelasticity theory of epithelia, supported by a thin layer of extracellular\\nmaterial and the stroma, in which the mechanics of individual cells are\\ndominated by differential interfacial tensions stemming from cell cortical\\ntension and adhesion. Upon coarse-graining a discrete single-cell-level\\nmechanics model, we obtain a harmonic deformation energy and derive the\\ncritical conditions for the elastic instability, where an initially flat tissue\\neither buckles out of plane or forms wrinkles. Due to the distinct origin of\\nelasticity, the scaling of the critical load to induce an instability and the\\nwrinkling wavelength with layer thickness is fundamentally different than in\\nsolid plates. The theory also naturally describes reversal of the\\ngroove-to-crest thickness-modulation phase--a recently observed epithelial\\nshape feature which cannot be explained by the classical elasticity theory. Our\\nwork provides a guideline for understanding the relative role of cell surface\\ntensions and the interaction of tissues with substrates during epithelial\\nmorphogenesis.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,physics.bio-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T07:55:13Z\"}"}
