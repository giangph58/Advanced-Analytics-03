In the notation of our\\nprevious papers, here we consider the case when $N_{\\\\alpha}$ is any negative\\ninteger and $y_{0}=b^{2}$ for any positive integer, $b$. We show that there are\\nat most $4$ distinct squares with $y_{k}$ sufficiently large. This allows us to\\nalso show that there are at most $9$ distinct squares in such sequences when\\n$b=1,2$ or $3$, or once $d$ is sufficiently large.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T16:56:45Z\"}"}
