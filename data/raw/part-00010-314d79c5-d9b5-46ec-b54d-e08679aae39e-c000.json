The underlying idea behind the scheme is to construct a\\nbank of multiple R-RENs (acting as fault isolation filters), each with\\ndifferent levels of sensitivity (increased or decreased) to faults at different\\nsensors. That is, each R-REN is designed to be specifically sensitive to faults\\noccurring in a particular sensor and robust against faults in all the others.\\nThe latter is guaranteed using the built-in incremental stability properties of\\nR-RENs. The proposed method is unsupervised (as it does not require labeled\\ndata from faulty sensors) and data-driven (because it exploits available\\nfault-free input-output system trajectories and does not rely on dynamic models\\nof the system under study). Numerical simulations on a roll-plane model of a\\nvehicle demonstrate the effectiveness and practical applicability of the\\nproposed methodology.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T11:28:32Z\"}"}
