{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03681v1\", \"title\": \"A review of DNA restriction-free overlapping sequence cloning techniques\\n  for synthetic biology\", \"summary\": \"DNA cloning methods are fundamental tools in molecular biology, synthetic\\nbiology, and genetic engineering that enable precise DNA manipulation for\\nvarious scientific and biotechnological applications. This review\\nsystematically summarizes the major restriction-free overlapping sequence\\ncloning (RFOSC) techniques currently used in synthetic biology and examines\\ntheir development, efficiency, practicality, and specific applications. In\\nvitro methods, including Gibson Assembly, Circular Polymerase Extension Cloning\\n(CPEC), Polymerase Incomplete Primer Extension (PIPE), Overlap Extension\\nCloning (OEC), Flap Endonuclease Cloning (FEN-Cloning), and commercially\\navailable techniques such as TOPO and In-Fusion, have been discussed alongside\\nhybrid approaches such as Ligation-Independent Cloning (LIC),\\nSequence-Independent Cloning (SLIC), and T5 Exonuclease-Dependent Assembly\\n(TEDA). Additionally, in vivo methods leveraging host recombination machinery,\\nincluding Yeast Homologous Recombination (YHR), In Vivo Assembly (IVA),\\nTransformation-Associated Recombination (TAR), and innovative approaches such\\nas Multiple-Round In Vivo Site-Specific Assembly (MISSA) and Phage\\nEnzyme-Assisted Direct Assembly (PEDA), are critically evaluated. The review\\nhighlights that method selection should consider the scale, complexity, cost,\\nand specific needs of individual research projects, noting that no single\\ntechnique is universally optimal. Future trends suggest the increased\\nintegration of enzymatic efficiency, host versatility, and automation,\\nbroadening the accessibility and capabilities of DNA assembly technologies.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.BM\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.BM\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T16:27:42Z\"}"}
