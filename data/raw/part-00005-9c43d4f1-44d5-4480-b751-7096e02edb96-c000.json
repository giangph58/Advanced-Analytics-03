{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20525v1\", \"title\": \"Geometry-aware Temporal Aggregation Network for Monocular 3D Lane\\n  Detection\", \"summary\": \"Monocular 3D lane detection aims to estimate 3D position of lanes from\\nfrontal-view (FV) images. However, current monocular 3D lane detection methods\\nsuffer from two limitations, including inaccurate geometric information of the\\npredicted 3D lanes and difficulties in maintaining lane integrity. To address\\nthese issues, we seek to fully exploit the potential of multiple input frames.\\nFirst, we aim at enhancing the ability to perceive the geometry of scenes by\\nleveraging temporal geometric consistency. Second, we strive to improve the\\nintegrity of lanes by revealing more instance information from temporal\\nsequences. Therefore, we propose a novel Geometry-aware Temporal Aggregation\\nNetwork (GTA-Net) for monocular 3D lane detection. On one hand, we develop the\\nTemporal Geometry Enhancement Module (TGEM), which exploits geometric\\nconsistency across successive frames, facilitating effective geometry\\nperception. On the other hand, we present the Temporal Instance-aware Query\\nGeneration (TIQG), which strategically incorporates temporal cues into query\\ngeneration, thereby enabling the exploration of comprehensive instance\\ninformation. Experiments demonstrate that our GTA-Net achieves SoTA results,\\nsurpassing existing monocular 3D lane detection solutions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T08:10:17Z\"}"}
