Here we present a novel technique for deterministic\\ncreation of single organic color centers in carbon nanotubes using\\n\\\\textit{in-situ} photochemical reaction. By monitoring discrete intensity\\nchanges in photoluminescence spectra, we achieve precise control over the\\nformation of individual color centers. Furthermore, our method allows for\\nposition-controlled formation of color centers as validated through\\nphotoluminescence imaging. We also demonstrate photon antibunching from a color\\ncenter, confirming the quantum nature of the defects formed. This technique\\nrepresents a significant step forward in the precise engineering of atomically\\ndefined quantum emitters in carbon nanotubes, facilitating their integration\\ninto advanced quantum photonic devices and systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T03:56:06Z\"}"}
