The UVLFs are constructed and subsequently\\ncharacterised with fitted Schechter function parameters from FUV observations\\nat z$<0.13$ and NUV observations in seven redshift bins in z~0.8-0.4. The UVLF\\nslope ($\\\\alpha$) and characteristic magnitude ($M^*$) are consistent with\\nprevious determinations for this redshift range based on AstroSat/UVIT\\nGOODS-North observations, as well as with those from Galaxy evolution Explorer\\nand Hubble Space Telescope observations. However, differences in the\\nnormalisation factor ($\\\\phi_{*}$) are present for UVLFs for some redshift bins.\\nWe compute the UV luminosity density, $\\\\rho_{\\\\rm UV}$, combining our determined\\nUVLF parameters with literature determinations out to z$\\\\sim10$. The $\\\\rho_{\\\\rm\\nUV}$ trend with redshift implies the rapid increase in cosmic star formation\\ntill its peak at z$\\\\sim3$ (cosmic noon) followed by a slow decline till present\\nday. Both the initial increase in cosmic star formation and subsequent decline\\nare found to be more rapid than previous determinations.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T05:40:32Z\"}"}
