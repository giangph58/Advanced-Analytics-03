{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14892v1\", \"title\": \"A level set topology optimization theory based on Hamilton's principle\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we present a novel framework for deriving the evolution\\nequation of the level set function in topology optimization, departing from\\nconventional Hamilton-Jacobi based formulations. The key idea is the\\nintroduction of an auxiliary domain, geometrically identical to the physical\\ndesign domain, occupied by fictitious matter which is dynamically excited by\\nthe conditions prevailing in the design domain. By assigning kinetic and\\npotential energy to this matter and interpreting the level set function as the\\ngeneralized coordinate to describe its deformation, the governing equation of\\nmotion is determined via Hamilton's principle, yielding a modified wave\\nequation. Appropriate combinations of model parameters enable the recovery of\\nclassical physical behaviors, including the standard and biharmonic wave\\nequations. The evolution problem is formulated in weak form using variational\\nmethods and implemented in the software environment FreeFEM++. The influence of\\nthe numerical parameters is analyzed on the example of minimum mean compliance.\\nThe results demonstrate that topological complexity and strut design can be\\neffectively controlled by the respective parameters. In addition, the method\\nallows for the nucleation of new holes and eliminates the need for\\nre-initializing the level set function. The inclusion of a damping term further\\nenhances numerical stability. To showcase the versatility and robustness of our\\nmethod, we also apply it to compliant mechanism design and a bi-objective\\noptimization problem involving self-weight and compliance minimization under\\nlocal stress constraints.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T06:41:29Z\"}"}
