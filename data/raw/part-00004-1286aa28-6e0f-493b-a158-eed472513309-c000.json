{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20389v1\", \"title\": \"CloudQC: A Network-aware Framework for Multi-tenant Distributed Quantum\\n  Computing\", \"summary\": \"Distributed quantum computing (DQC) that allows a large quantum circuit to be\\nexecuted simultaneously on multiple quantum processing units (QPUs) becomes a\\npromising approach to increase the scalability of quantum computing. It is\\nnatural to envision the near-future DQC platform as a multi-tenant cluster of\\nQPUs, called a Quantum Cloud. However, no existing DQC work has addressed the\\ntwo key problems of running DQC in a multi-tenant quantum cloud: placing\\nmultiple quantum circuits to QPUs and scheduling network resources to complete\\nthese jobs. This work is the first attempt to design a circuit placement and\\nresource scheduling framework for a multi-tenant environment. The proposed\\nframework is called CloudQC, which includes two main functional components,\\ncircuit placement and network scheduler, with the objectives of optimizing both\\nquantum network cost and quantum computing time. Experimental results with real\\nquantum circuit workloads show that CloudQC significantly reduces the average\\njob completion time compared to existing DQC placement algorithms for both\\nsingle-circuit and multi-circuit DQC. We envision this work will motivate more\\nfuture work on network-aware quantum cloud.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T03:19:35Z\"}"}
