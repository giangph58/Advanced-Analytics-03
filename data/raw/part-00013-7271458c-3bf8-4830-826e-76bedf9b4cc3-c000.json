To this end, we introduce the\\nconcept of a resolvent family associated with the linear evolution equation\\nwith memory and develop some of its essential properties. Subsequently, we\\nconsider a linear-quadratic regulator problem to determine the optimal control\\nthat yields approximate controllability for the linear control system.\\nFurthermore, we derive sufficient conditions for the existence of a mild\\nsolution and the approximate controllability of a semilinear system in a\\nsuper-reflexive Banach space. Additionally, we present an approximate\\ncontrollability result within the framework of a general Banach space. Finally,\\nwe apply our theoretical findings to investigate the approximate\\ncontrollability of the heat equation with singular memory.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T13:58:06Z\"}"}
