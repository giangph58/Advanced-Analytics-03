To\\nthis end, highly resolved Large Eddy Simulations are performed to explore the\\neffect of wall thermal conditions on the behavior of a reattaching free shear\\nlayer interacting with an oblique shock in compressible turbulent flows.\\nVarious different wall temperature conditions, such as cold adiabatic and hot\\nwall, are considered. Dynamic mode decomposition is used to isolate and study\\nthe structures generated by the shear layer exposed in the boundary layer.\\nResults reveal that the shear layer flapping is the most energetic mode. The\\nhot wall gains the highest amplitude for the flapping frequency, and the\\nvortical motions are most intense in the vicinity of the reattachment point of\\nthe heated wall. The vortex shedding due to the large-scale motion of the shear\\nlayer is associated with the second energetic mode. The cold wall not only has\\na higher amplitude of the shedding mode, but it also has a lower frequency\\ncompared to the adiabatic and hot walls. This work sheds light on the\\nunderlying physics of the nonlinear intercoupling of momentum and heat, hence\\nproviding guidelines for designing control systems for high speed flight\\nvehicles and mitigating aircraft fatigue loading caused by intense wall\\npressure fluctuations and heat flux.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:59:10Z\"}"}
