Natural language\\nprovides the most accessible medium for this purpose. However, translating\\nlanguage into humanoid whole-body motion remains a significant challenge,\\nprimarily due to the gap between linguistic understanding and physical actions.\\nIn this work, we present an end-to-end, language-directed policy for real-world\\nhumanoid whole-body control. Our approach combines reinforcement learning with\\npolicy distillation, allowing a single neural network to interpret language\\ncommands and execute corresponding physical actions directly. To enhance motion\\ndiversity and compositionality, we incorporate a Conditional Variational\\nAutoencoder (CVAE) structure. The resulting policy achieves agile and versatile\\nwhole-body behaviors conditioned on language inputs, with smooth transitions\\nbetween various motions, enabling adaptation to linguistic variations and the\\nemergence of novel motions. We validate the efficacy and generalizability of\\nour method through extensive simulations and real-world experiments,\\ndemonstrating robust whole-body control.
