In this work, we propose a novel operator inference\\napproach for elliptic eigenvalue problems based on neural network\\napproximations that directly maps computational domains to their associated\\neigenvalues and eigenfunctions. Motivated by existing neural network\\narchitectures and the mathematical characteristics of eigenvalue problems, we\\nrepresent computational domains as pixelated images and decompose the task into\\ntwo subtasks: eigenvalue prediction and eigenfunction prediction. For the\\neigenvalue prediction, we design a convolutional neural network (CNN), while\\nfor the eigenfunction prediction, we employ a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO).\\nAdditionally, we introduce a critical preprocessing module that integrates\\ndomain scaling, detailed boundary pixelization, and main-axis alignment. This\\npreprocessing step not only simplifies the learning task but also enhances the\\nperformance of the neural networks. Finally, we present numerical results to\\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T09:25:36Z\"}"}
