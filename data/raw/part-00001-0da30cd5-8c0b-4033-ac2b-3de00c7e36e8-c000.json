{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21337v1\", \"title\": \"Cross-Reality Lifestyle: Integrating Physical and Virtual Lives through\\n  Multi-Platform Metaverse\", \"summary\": \"Technological advances are redefining the relationship between physical and\\nvirtual space. Traditionally, when users engage in virtual reality (VR), they\\nare completely cut off from the physical space; similarly, they are unable to\\naccess virtual experiences while engaged in physical activities. However,\\nmodern multi-platform metaverse environments allow simultaneous participation\\nthrough mobile devices, creating new opportunities for integrated experiences.\\nThis study introduces the concept of \\\"cross-reality lifestyles\\\" to examine how\\nusers actively combine their physical and virtual activities. We identify three\\npatterns of integration: 1) amplification: one space enhances experiences in\\nthe other; 2) complementary: spaces offer different but equally valuable\\nalternatives; and 3) emergence: simultaneous engagement creates entirely new\\nexperiences. By analyzing commercial platforms, we create a technical framework\\nthat addresses content design, platform infrastructure, and device interfaces.\\nThis framework guides the development of cross-reality applications while\\ndemonstrating how metaverse technologies blur the traditional boundaries\\nbetween physical and virtual experiences.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T05:53:26Z\"}"}
