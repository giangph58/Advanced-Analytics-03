Here, we demonstrate an atomic\\ncomagnetometer operating under a resonantly-coupled hybrid spin-resonance (HSR)\\nregime to probe P-odd, T-even interactions. The HSR regime enables robust\\nnuclear-electron spin coupling, enhancing measurement bandwidth and stability\\nwithout compromising the high sensitivity of spin-exchange relaxation-free\\nmagnetometers. To minimize vibration noise from velocity-modulated sources, we\\nimplement a multistage vibration isolation system, achieving a vibration noise\\nreduction exceeding 700-fold. We establish new constraints on\\nvector-boson-mediated parity-violating interactions, improving experimental\\nsensitivity by three orders of magnitude compared to previous limits. The new\\nconstraints complement existing astrophysical and laboratory studies of\\npotential extensions to the Standard Model.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T12:29:19Z\"}"}
