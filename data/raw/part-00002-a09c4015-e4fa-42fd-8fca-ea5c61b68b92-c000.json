By conducting a fit to the cross sections of\\n$e^+e^-\\\\to \\\\Omega^{-}\\\\bar{\\\\Omega}^+$ considering the continuum and resonant\\ncontributions, a clear resonant structure in the spectrum around 4.2 GeV is\\nobserved for the first time with a statistical significance exceeding\\n10$\\\\sigma$, and it can be well described with the line shape of the $Y(4230)$\\nand $Y(4320)$ observed in $e^+e^-\\\\to \\\\pi^{+}\\\\pi^{-}J/\\\\psi$. Evidence for the\\ndecay $\\\\psi(3770) \\\\to \\\\Omega^-\\\\bar{\\\\Omega}^{+}$ is observed with a statistical\\nsignificance of 4.4$\\\\sigma$ by analyzing the measured cross sections together\\nwith earlier BESIII results, and the branching fraction is firstly measured to\\nbe $(4.0\\\\pm1.0\\\\pm0.6)$ $\\\\times$ $10^{-5}$, where the first uncertainty is\\nstatistical and the second is systematic.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T04:49:46Z\"}"}
