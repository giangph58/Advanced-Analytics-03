Experiments show that\\nsound decibel value time series can better characterize the chaotic dynamics of\\nthe system. Based on the control variable method, the mixing time and LLE all\\nshow a nonlinear trend of decreasing and then increasing, or increasing and\\nthen decreasing, with the increase of eccentricity and rotational speed. When\\nE/R=0.4 and the rotational speed N=450rpm, the mixing time was shortened by 48%\\ncompared with the center mixing, and the degree of chaos reached the peak. The\\ndimensionless chaos indicator model is further constructed to reveal the\\nquantitative relationship between the eccentric stirring parameters and the\\nchaos intensity. This method provides a theoretical basis for the real-time\\nmonitoring of the chaotic characteristics of complex flow fields and the\\noptimization of industrial mixing equipment.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph,M.0,A.0\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T13:24:24Z\"}"}
