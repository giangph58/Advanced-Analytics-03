Current practices at many AI labs developing these systems lack\\nsufficient transparency around safety measures, testing procedures, and\\ngovernance structures. This opacity makes it challenging to verify safety\\nclaims or establish appropriate liability when harm occurs. Drawing on\\nliability frameworks from nuclear energy, aviation software, and healthcare, we\\npropose a comprehensive approach to safety documentation and accountability in\\nfrontier AI development.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T15:47:14Z\"}"}
