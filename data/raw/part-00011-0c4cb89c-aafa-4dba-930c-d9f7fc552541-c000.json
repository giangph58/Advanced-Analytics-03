{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04938v1\", \"title\": \"FF-PNet: A Pyramid Network Based on Feature and Field for Brain Image\\n  Registration\", \"summary\": \"In recent years, deformable medical image registration techniques have made\\nsignificant progress. However, existing models still lack efficiency in\\nparallel extraction of coarse and fine-grained features. To address this, we\\nconstruct a new pyramid registration network based on feature and deformation\\nfield (FF-PNet). For coarse-grained feature extraction, we design a Residual\\nFeature Fusion Module (RFFM), for fine-grained image deformation, we propose a\\nResidual Deformation Field Fusion Module (RDFFM). Through the parallel\\noperation of these two modules, the model can effectively handle complex image\\ndeformations. It is worth emphasizing that the encoding stage of FF-PNet only\\nemploys traditional convolutional neural networks without any attention\\nmechanisms or multilayer perceptrons, yet it still achieves remarkable\\nimprovements in registration accuracy, fully demonstrating the superior feature\\ndecoding capabilities of RFFM and RDFFM. We conducted extensive experiments on\\nthe LPBA and OASIS datasets. The results show our network consistently\\noutperforms popular methods in metrics like the Dice Similarity Coefficient.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T04:27:11Z\"}"}
