{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19592v1\", \"title\": \"Neural network task specialization via domain constraining\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces a concept of neural network specialization via\\ntask-specific domain constraining, aimed at enhancing network performance on\\ndata subspace in which the network operates. The study presents experiments on\\ntraining specialists for image classification and object detection tasks. The\\nresults demonstrate that specialization can enhance a generalist's accuracy\\neven without additional data or changing training regimes: solely by\\nconstraining class label space in which the network performs. Theoretical and\\nexperimental analyses indicate that effective specialization requires modifying\\ntraditional fine-tuning methods and constraining data space to semantically\\ncoherent subsets. The specialist extraction phase before tuning the network is\\nproposed for maximal performance gains. We also provide analysis of the\\nevolution of the feature space during specialization. This study paves way to\\nfuture research for developing more advanced dynamically configurable image\\nanalysis systems, where computations depend on the specific input.\\nAdditionally, the proposed methods can help improve system performance in\\nscenarios where certain data domains should be excluded from consideration of\\nthe generalist network.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T08:57:01Z\"}"}
