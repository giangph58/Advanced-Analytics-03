{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21500v1\", \"title\": \"Visual Analytics Challenges and Trends in the Age of AI: The BigVis\\n  Community Perspective\", \"summary\": \"This report provides insights into the challenges, emerging topics, and\\nopportunities related to human-data interaction and visual analytics in the AI\\nera. The BigVis 2024 organizing committee conducted a survey among experts in\\nthe field. They invite the Program Committee members and the authors of\\naccepted papers to share their views. Thirty-two scientists from diverse\\nresearch communities, including Databases, Information Visualization, and\\nHuman-Computer Interaction, participated in the study. These scientists,\\nrepresenting both industry and academia, provided valuable insights into the\\ncurrent and future landscape of the field.\\n  In this report, we analyze the survey responses and compare them to the\\nfindings of a similar study conducted four years ago. The results reveal some\\ninteresting insights. First, many of the critical challenges identified in the\\nprevious survey remain highly relevant today, despite being unrelated to AI.\\nMeanwhile, the field's landscape has significantly evolved, with most of\\ntoday's vital challenges not even being mentioned in the earlier survey,\\nunderscoring the profound impact of AI-related advancements.\\n  By summarizing the perspectives of the research community, this report aims\\nto shed light on the key challenges, emerging trends, and potential research\\ndirections in human-data interaction and visual analytics in the AI era.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DB\", \"categories\": \"cs.DB,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T10:41:52Z\"}"}
