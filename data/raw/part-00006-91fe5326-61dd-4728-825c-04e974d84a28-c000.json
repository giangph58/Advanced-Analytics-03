The primary objective is to\\nunderstand the interplay between the relativistic jet, the hot corona, and the\\naccretion disk around the supermassive black hole. This study spans the years\\n2006 to 2023, incorporating a rich dataset with 172 Swift observations,\\nincluding the optical, UV, and X-ray bands, integrated with Fermi Large Area\\nTelescope (LAT) observations. Spectral analysis was conducted on the X-ray\\nobservations using the XSPEC software, and the results were compared with\\noptical, UV, and gamma-ray flux measurements and photon index values. Our key\\nfindings include the identification of three distinct zones in the X-ray photon\\nindex-flux plot, characterized by high flux and a hard photon index (zone 1),\\nhigh flux and a soft photon index (zone 2), and low flux and a soft photon\\nindex (zone 3). Before 2017, 1H 0323+342 moved back and forth between zones 1\\nand 2; after that epoch, it transitioned to zones 2 and 3. Correspondingly, we\\nobserved a decreasing jet activity in the Fermi/LAT data and a reduction in the\\naccretion rate in optical/UV data from Swift/UVOT. We interpret these\\nobservations in the framework of an intermittent jet scenario, driven by\\nradiation-pressure instability in the accretion disk.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T08:54:01Z\"}"}
