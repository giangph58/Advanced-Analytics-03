In this\\nwork, we prove the existence of fixed points in the essential JPEG procedures.\\nWe analyze JPEG compression and decompression processes, revealing the\\nexistence of fixed points that can be reached within a few iterations. These\\nfixed points are diverse and preserve the image's visual quality, ensuring\\nminimal distortion. This result is used to develop a method to create a\\ntamper-evident image from the original authentic image, which can expose\\ntampering operations by showing deviations from the fixed point image.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,I.4.7\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:22:13Z\"}"}
