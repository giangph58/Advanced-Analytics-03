A comparative study is done with Cr adsorbed in\\ndefect-free and single vacancy defect graphene systems. Ab-initio calculations\\nare performed with and without Van der Waals interaction to check the hydrogen\\nstorage efficiency. Efficiency is determined by calculating the binding energy\\nof the system. The preferred range for binding energy for reversible hydrogen\\nstorage, as determined by the Department of Energy, US, is between 0.2-0.6 eV.\\nThis work also visualizes the thermal stability spectrum of the efficient\\nmaterials at 300 K using molecular dynamics calculations, predicting their\\nstability at room temperature.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T09:51:56Z\"}"}
