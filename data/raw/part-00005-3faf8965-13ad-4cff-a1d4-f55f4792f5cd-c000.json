We\\nfocus on two different types of circularity, called weak and strong\\ncircularity. When the morphism is injective on the language of the system, the\\ntwo notions are equivalent, but they may differ otherwise. Our main result\\nshows that failure of weak circularity implies unbounded repetitiveness, and\\nthat unbounded repetitiveness implies failure of strong circularity. This\\nextends previous work by the second and third authors for injective systems. To\\nhelp motivate this work, we also give examples of non-injective but strongly\\ncircular systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DM\", \"categories\": \"cs.DM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T12:20:34Z\"}"}
