However, accurate visible and\\nthermal (RGB-T) image registration poses a significant challenge due to the\\nconsiderable modality differences. In this paper, we present a novel joint\\nSelf-Correlation and Cross-Correspondence Estimation Framework (SC3EF),\\nleveraging both local representative features and global contextual cues to\\neffectively generate RGB-T correspondences. For this purpose, we design a\\nconvolution-transformer-based pipeline to extract local representative features\\nand encode global correlations of intra-modality for inter-modality\\ncorrespondence estimation between unaligned visible and thermal images. After\\nmerging the local and global correspondence estimation results, we further\\nemploy a hierarchical optical flow estimation decoder to progressively refine\\nthe estimated dense correspondence maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\\neffectiveness of our proposed method, outperforming the current\\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on representative RGB-T datasets. Furthermore,\\nit also shows competitive generalization capabilities across challenging\\nscenarios, including large parallax, severe occlusions, adverse weather, and\\nother cross-modal datasets (e.g., RGB-N and RGB-D).\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T11:54:12Z\"}"}
