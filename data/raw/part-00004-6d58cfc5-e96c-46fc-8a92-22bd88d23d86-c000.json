Projective measurements on some bases in the time-bin encoding need,\\nhowever, post-selection of the measured events, introducing a loophole in Bell\\ntests and requiring high temporal resolution. In this work, we demonstrate\\nchip-integrated receivers for time-bin entanglement certification including a\\nhigh-speed optical switch to remove such post-selection loophole. The receivers\\nare realized using thin-film lithium niobate and operate at a switching\\nfrequency of 5 GHz, enabling high secure key rates. We demonstrate a Bell\\ninequality violation by more than 24 standard deviations without the need for\\ntime resolution at the time-bin separation level.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T17:39:03Z\"}"}
