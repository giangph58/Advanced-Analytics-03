We used 4 to 43~GHz\\nVLBI polarization data from VLBA. Core RM across 4 to 15 GHz scales with a\\npower index $a\\\\sim2$, for $a$ in RM$\\\\propto \\\\nu^a$. We detected sign changes\\nacross epochs, both in the core and in the jet region. RM time variability in\\nthe core and jet region are not correlated, hence limiting the size of a\\npossible Faraday screen. We relate the core RM variability to a new component\\nemerging from the core region. For the jet region, we consider the jet-medium\\ninteraction to be a less likely cause of the RM variability because of the\\nuniform spectral index distribution. The observed RM value variation requires a\\nhuge fluctuation in electron density or magnetic field, hence a foreground\\nFaraday screen is less favoured. We further discuss other possibilities of the\\nRM variability based on jet kinematics.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:03:02Z\"}"}
