{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04254v1\", \"title\": \"CompileAgent: Automated Real-World Repo-Level Compilation with\\n  Tool-Integrated LLM-based Agent System\", \"summary\": \"With open-source projects growing in size and complexity, manual compilation\\nbecomes tedious and error-prone, highlighting the need for automation to\\nimprove efficiency and accuracy. However, the complexity of compilation\\ninstruction search and error resolution makes automatic compilation\\nchallenging. Inspired by the success of LLM-based agents in various fields, we\\npropose CompileAgent, the first LLM-based agent framework dedicated to\\nrepo-level compilation. CompileAgent integrates five tools and a flow-based\\nagent strategy, enabling interaction with software artifacts for compilation\\ninstruction search and error resolution. To measure the effectiveness of our\\nmethod, we design a public repo-level benchmark CompileAgentBench, and we also\\ndesign two baselines for comparison by combining two compilation-friendly\\nschemes. The performance on this benchmark shows that our method significantly\\nimproves the compilation success rate, ranging from 10% to 71%. Meanwhile, we\\nevaluate the performance of CompileAgent under different agent strategies and\\nverify the effectiveness of the flow-based strategy. Additionally, we emphasize\\nthe scalability of CompileAgent, further expanding its application prospects.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:59:14Z\"}"}
