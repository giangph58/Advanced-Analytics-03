{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11290v1\", \"title\": \"Automated Python Translation\", \"summary\": \"Python is one of the most commonly used programming languages in industry and\\neducation. Its English keywords and built-in functions/modules allow it to come\\nclose to pseudo-code in terms of its readability and ease of writing. However,\\nthose who do not speak English may not experience these advantages. In fact,\\nthey may even be hindered in their ability to understand Python code, as the\\nEnglish nature of its terms creates an additional layer of overhead. To that\\nend, we introduce the task of automatically translating Python's natural\\nmodality (keywords, error types, identifiers, etc.) into other human languages.\\nThis presents a unique challenge, considering the abbreviated nature of these\\nforms, as well as potential untranslatability of advanced\\nmathematical/programming concepts across languages. We therefore create an\\nautomated pipeline to translate Python into other human languages, comparing\\nstrategies using machine translation and large language models. We then use\\nthis pipeline to acquire translations from five common Python libraries\\n(pytorch, pandas, tensorflow, numpy, and random) in seven languages, and do a\\nquality test on a subset of these terms in French, Greek, and Bengali. We hope\\nthis will provide a clearer path forward towards creating a universal Python,\\naccessible to anyone regardless of nationality or language background.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:30:22Z\"}"}
