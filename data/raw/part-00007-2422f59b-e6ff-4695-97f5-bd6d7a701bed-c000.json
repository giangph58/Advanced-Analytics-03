When the hypersurface is presented as a regular graph of a convex\\nfunction $u$, the statement that the graph is of affine maximal type is\\nequivalent to the statement that $u$ satisfies the fully nonlinear partial\\ndifferential equation\\n  $$\\n  D_{ij}(U^{ij}w)=0, \\\\ \\\\ w\\\\equiv[\\\\det D^2u]^{-\\\\theta}, \\\\ \\\\ \\\\theta>0, \\\\ \\\\\\n\\\\forall x\\\\in{\\\\mathbb{R}}^N\\n  $$ of fourth order. This equation can be regarded as a generalization of the\\n$N$-dimensional Monge-Amp\\\\`{e}re equation\\n  $$\\n  \\\\det D^2u=1, \\\\ \\\\ \\\\forall x\\\\in{\\\\mathbb{R}}^N\\n  $$ of second order, since each solution of Monge-Amp\\\\`{e}re Equation\\nsatisfies affine maximal type equation automatically. In this paper, we will\\ndetermine the symmetry groups of these two important fully nonlinear equations\\nwithout asymptotic growth assumption. Our method develops the Lie's theory to\\nfully nonlinear PDEs.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T10:16:28Z\"}"}
