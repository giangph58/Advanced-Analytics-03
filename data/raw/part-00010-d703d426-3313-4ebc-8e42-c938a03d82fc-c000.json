Here, alternating-current (AC) driven magnetization reversal\\nis demonstrated in a semi-magnetic topological insulator\\n(Cr,Bi,Sb)2Te3/(Bi,Sb)2Te3, facilitated by a low threshold current density of\\n1.5x10^9 A/m^2. Time-domain Hall voltage measurements using an oscilloscope\\nreveal a strongly nonlinear and nonreciprocal Hall response during the\\nmagnetization reversal process. Fourier analysis of the time-varying Hall\\nvoltage identifies higher-harmonic signals and a rectified direct-current (DC)\\ncomponent, highlighting the complex interplay among the applied current,\\nexternal magnetic field, and magnetization dynamics. Furthermore, a hysteretic\\nbehavior in the current-voltage characteristics gives rise to frequency mixing\\nunder dual-frequency excitation. This effect, distinct from conventional\\npolynomial-based nonlinearities, allows for selective extraction of specific\\nfrequency components. The results demonstrate that AC excitation can not only\\nswitch magnetization efficiently but also induce tunable nonlinear responses,\\noffering a new pathway for multifunctional spintronic devices with potential\\napplications in energy-efficient memory, signal processing, and frequency\\nconversion.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:38:34Z\"}"}
