{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14897v1\", \"title\": \"Physics-Aware Compression of Plasma Distribution Functions with\\n  GPU-Accelerated Gaussian Mixture Models\", \"summary\": \"Data compression is a critical technology for large-scale plasma simulations.\\nStoring complete particle information requires Terabyte-scale data storage, and\\nanalysis requires ad-hoc scalable post-processing tools. We propose a\\nphysics-aware in-situ compression method using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)\\nto approximate electron and ion velocity distribution functions with a number\\nof Gaussian components. This GMM-based method allows us to capture plasma\\nfeatures such as mean velocity and temperature, and it enables us to identify\\nheating processes and generate beams. We first construct a histogram to reduce\\ncomputational overhead and apply GPU-accelerated, in-situ GMM fitting within\\n\\\\texttt{iPIC3D}, a large-scale implicit Particle-in-Cell simulator, ensuring\\nreal-time compression. The compressed representation is stored using the\\n\\\\texttt{ADIOS 2} library, thus optimizing the I/O process. The GPU and\\nhistogramming implementation provides a significant speed-up with respect to\\nGMM on particles (both in time and required memory at run-time), enabling\\nreal-time compression. Compared to algorithms like SZ, MGARD, and BLOSC2, our\\nGMM-based method has a physics-based approach, retaining the physical\\ninterpretation of plasma phenomena such as beam formation, acceleration, and\\nheating mechanisms. Our GMM algorithm achieves a compression ratio of up to\\n$10^4$, requiring a processing time comparable to, or even lower than, standard\\ncompression engines.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CE\", \"categories\": \"cs.CE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T07:07:49Z\"}"}
