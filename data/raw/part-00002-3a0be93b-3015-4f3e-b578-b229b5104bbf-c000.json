{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11106v1\", \"title\": \"Token-Level Constraint Boundary Search for Jailbreaking Text-to-Image\\n  Models\", \"summary\": \"Recent advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation have significantly\\nenhanced the realism and creativity of generated images. However, such powerful\\ngenerative capabilities pose risks related to the production of inappropriate\\nor harmful content. Existing defense mechanisms, including prompt checkers and\\npost-hoc image checkers, are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial attacks.\\nIn this work, we propose TCBS-Attack, a novel query-based black-box jailbreak\\nattack that searches for tokens located near the decision boundaries defined by\\ntext and image checkers. By iteratively optimizing tokens near these\\nboundaries, TCBS-Attack generates semantically coherent adversarial prompts\\ncapable of bypassing multiple defensive layers in T2I models. Extensive\\nexperiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms\\nstate-of-the-art jailbreak attacks across various T2I models, including\\nsecurely trained open-source models and commercial online services like DALL-E\\n3. TCBS-Attack achieves an ASR-4 of 45\\\\% and an ASR-1 of 21\\\\% on jailbreaking\\nfull-chain T2I models, significantly surpassing baseline methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T11:53:40Z\"}"}
