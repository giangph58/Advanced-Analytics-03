{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20961v1\", \"title\": \"Simple Finite-Length Achievability and Converse Bounds for the Deletion\\n  Channel and the Insertion Channel\", \"summary\": \"We develop upper bounds on code size for independent and identically\\ndistributed deletion (insertion) channel for given code length and target frame\\nerror probability. The bounds are obtained as a variation of a general converse\\nbound, which, though available for any channel, is inefficient and not easily\\ncomputable without a good reference distribution over the output alphabet. We\\nobtain a reference output distribution for a general finite-input finite-output\\nchannel and provide a simple formula for the converse bound on the capacity\\nemploying this distribution. We then evaluate the bound for the deletion\\nchannel with a finite block length and show that the resulting upper bound on\\nthe code side is tighter than that for a binary erasure channel, which is the\\nonly alternative converse bound for this finite-length setting. Also, we\\nprovide the similar results for the insertion channel.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:32:27Z\"}"}
