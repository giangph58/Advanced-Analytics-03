{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16804v1\", \"title\": \"Constructing Four-Body Ballistic Lunar Transfers via Analytical Energy\\n  Conditions\", \"summary\": \"This paper derives and summarizes the analytical conditions for lunar\\nballistic capture and constructs ballistic lunar transfers based on these\\nconditions. We adopt the Sun-Earth/Moon planar bicircular restricted four-body\\nproblem as the dynamical model to construct lunar transfers. First, the\\nanalytical conditions for ballistic capture are derived based on the\\nrelationship between the Keplerian energy with respect to the Moon and the\\nangular momentum with respect to the Moon, summarized in form of exact ranges\\nof the Jacobi energy at the lunar insertion point. Both sufficient and\\nnecessary condition and necessary condition are developed. Then, an\\noptimization method combined with the analytical energy conditions is proposed\\nto construct ballistic lunar transfers. Simulations shows that a high ballistic\\ncapture ratio is achieved by our proposed method (100$\\\\%$ for direct insertion\\nand $99.15\\\\%$ for retrograde insertion). Examining the obtained ballistic lunar\\ntransfers, the effectiveness of the analytical energy conditions is verified.\\nSamples of our obtained lunar transfers achieves a lower impulse and shorter\\ntime of flight compared to two conventional methods, further strengthening the\\nadvantage of our proposed method.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:22:02Z\"}"}
