It is vital that the explanation is accurate, or\\nfaithful, to the model, yet we identify several limitations of prior\\nfaithfulness metrics that inhibit an accurate evaluation; most notably, prior\\nmetrics involve only the set of concepts present, ignoring how they may be\\nspatially distributed. We address these limitations with Surrogate Faithfulness\\n(SF), an evaluation method that introduces a spatially-aware surrogate and two\\nnovel faithfulness metrics. Using SF, we produce Optimally Faithful (OF)\\nexplanations, where concepts are found that maximize faithfulness. Our\\nexperiments show that (1) adding spatial-awareness to prior U-CBEMs increases\\nfaithfulness in all cases; (2) OF produces significantly more faithful\\nexplanations than prior U-CBEMs (30% or higher improvement in error); (3) OF's\\nlearned concepts generalize well to out-of-domain data and are more robust to\\nadversarial examples, where prior U-CBEMs struggle.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T03:24:13Z\"}"}
