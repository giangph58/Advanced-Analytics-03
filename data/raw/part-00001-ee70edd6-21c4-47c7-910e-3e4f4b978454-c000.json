Specifically, each student has an\\ninitial assigned major and applies to transfer to a more desirable one. A\\nstudent can successfully transfer majors only if they obtain eligibility from\\nboth their initial major and the applied major. Each major has a dual priority:\\na strict priority over current students who wish to transfer out and a strict\\npriority over students from other majors who wish to transfer in. Additionally,\\neach major faces a ceiling constraint and a floor constraint to regulate\\nstudent distribution. We show that the existing mechanisms of CMT result in\\navoidable inefficiencies, and propose two mechanisms that can match students to\\nmajors in an efficient way as well as respecting each major's distributional\\nand dual priority. The efficient mechanisms are based on a proposed solution\\nconcept: eligibility maximization (EM), and two processes for identifying\\nimprovement cycles--specifically, transfer-in exchangeable cycles and\\ntransfer-out exchangeable cycles.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.TH\", \"categories\": \"econ.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T08:09:05Z\"}"}
