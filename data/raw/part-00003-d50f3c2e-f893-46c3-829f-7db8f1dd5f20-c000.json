Existing deep learning-based enhancement methods\\nstill fall short of practical application requirements, particularly in\\nrestoring low-quality fingerprint regions. Recognizing that different regions\\nof latent fingerprints require distinct enhancement strategies, we propose a\\nTriple Branch Spatial Fusion Network (TBSFNet), which simultaneously enhances\\ndifferent regions of the image using tailored strategies. Furthermore, to\\nimprove the generalization capability of the network, we integrate orientation\\nfield and minutiae-related modules into TBSFNet and introduce a Multi-Level\\nFeature Guidance Network (MLFGNet). Experimental results on the MOLF and MUST\\ndatasets demonstrate that MLFGNet outperforms existing enhancement algorithms.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T13:54:33Z\"}"}
