{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10416v1\", \"title\": \"Region Based SLAM-Aware Exploration: Efficient and Robust Autonomous\\n  Mapping Strategy That Can Scale\", \"summary\": \"Autonomous exploration for mapping unknown large scale environments is a\\nfundamental challenge in robotics, with efficiency in time, stability against\\nmap corruption and computational resources being crucial. This paper presents a\\nnovel approach to indoor exploration that addresses these key issues in\\nexisting methods. We introduce a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping\\n(SLAM)-aware region-based exploration strategy that partitions the environment\\ninto discrete regions, allowing the robot to incrementally explore and\\nstabilize each region before moving to the next one. This approach\\nsignificantly reduces redundant exploration and improves overall efficiency. As\\nthe device finishes exploring a region and stabilizes it, we also perform SLAM\\nkeyframe marginalization, a technique which reduces problem complexity by\\neliminating variables, while preserving their essential information. To\\nimproves robustness and further enhance efficiency, we develop a check- point\\nsystem that enables the robot to resume exploration from the last stable region\\nin case of failures, eliminating the need for complete re-exploration. Our\\nmethod, tested in real homes, office and simulations, outperforms\\nstate-of-the-art approaches. The improvements demonstrate substantial\\nenhancements in various real world environments, with significant reductions in\\nkeyframe usage (85%), submap usage (50% office, 32% home), pose graph\\noptimization time (78-80%), and exploration duration (10-15%). This\\nregion-based strategy with keyframe marginalization offers an efficient\\nsolution for autonomous robotic mapping.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:00:14Z\"}"}
