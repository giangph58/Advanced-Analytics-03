{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03207v1\", \"title\": \"Partial Label Clustering\", \"summary\": \"Partial label learning (PLL) is a significant weakly supervised learning\\nframework, where each training example corresponds to a set of candidate labels\\nand only one label is the ground-truth label. For the first time, this paper\\ninvestigates the partial label clustering problem, which takes advantage of the\\nlimited available partial labels to improve the clustering performance.\\nSpecifically, we first construct a weight matrix of examples based on their\\nrelationships in the feature space and disambiguate the candidate labels to\\nestimate the ground-truth label based on the weight matrix. Then, we construct\\na set of must-link and cannot-link constraints based on the disambiguation\\nresults. Moreover, we propagate the initial must-link and cannot-link\\nconstraints based on an adversarial prior promoted dual-graph learning\\napproach. Finally, we integrate weight matrix construction, label\\ndisambiguation, and pairwise constraints propagation into a joint model to\\nachieve mutual enhancement. We also theoretically prove that a better\\ndisambiguated label matrix can help improve clustering performance.\\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate our method realizes superior performance\\nwhen comparing with state-of-the-art constrained clustering methods, and\\noutperforms PLL and semi-supervised PLL methods when only limited samples are\\nannotated.
