However, it remains unclear\\nwhether fixed-degree SoS proofs can be automated [O'Donnell (2017)]. Indeed,\\nthere are examples of polynomial systems with bounded coefficients that admit\\nlow-degree SoS proofs, but these proofs necessarily involve numbers with an\\nexponential number of bits, implying that low-degree SoS proofs cannot always\\nbe found efficiently.\\n  A sufficient condition derived from the Nullstellensatz proof system\\n[Raghavendra and Weitz (2017)] identifies cases where bit complexity issues can\\nbe circumvented. One of the main problems left open by Raghavendra and Weitz is\\nproving any result for refutations, as their condition applies only to\\npolynomial systems with a large set of solutions.\\n  In this work, we broaden the class of polynomial systems for which degree-$d$\\nSoS proofs can be automated. To achieve this, we develop a new criterion and we\\ndemonstrate how our criterion applies to polynomial systems beyond the scope of\\nRaghavendra and Weitz's result. In particular, we establish a separation for\\ninstances arising from Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). Moreover, our\\nresult extends to refutations, establishing that polynomial-time refutation is\\npossible for broad classes of polynomial time solvable constraint problems,\\nhighlighting a first advancement in this area.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CC\", \"categories\": \"cs.CC,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T17:20:12Z\"}"}
