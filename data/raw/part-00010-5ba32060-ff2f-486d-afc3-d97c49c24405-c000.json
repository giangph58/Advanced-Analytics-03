To\\neffectively solve the privacy problem of financial data in trans-border flow\\nand sharing, to ensure that the data is available but not visible, to realize\\nthe joint portrait of all kinds of heterogeneous data of business organizations\\nin different industries, we propose a Heterogeneous Federated Graph Neural\\nNetwork (HFGNN) approach. In this method, the distribution of heterogeneous\\nbusiness data of trans-border organizations is taken as subgraphs, and the\\nsharing and circulation process among subgraphs is constructed as a\\nstatistically heterogeneous global graph through a central server. Each\\nsubgraph learns the corresponding personalized service model through local\\ntraining to select and update the relevant subset of subgraphs with aggregated\\nparameters, and effectively separates and combines topological and feature\\ninformation among subgraphs. Finally, our simulation experimental results show\\nthat the proposed method has higher accuracy performance and faster convergence\\nspeed than existing methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T02:47:43Z\"}"}
