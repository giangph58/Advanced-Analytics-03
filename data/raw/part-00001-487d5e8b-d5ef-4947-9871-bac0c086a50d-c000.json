We tackle this problem by considering the\\nmulti-population Wardrop equilibrium, defined through variational inequalities.\\nWe rigorously analyze the existence and uniqueness of the Wardrop equilibrium.\\nFurthermore, we introduce an efficient numerical method to find the solution.\\nIn particular, we reformulate the equilibrium problem as a distributed\\noptimization problem over subgraphs and introduce a novel Hessian Riemannian\\nflow method, a Riemannian-manifold-projected Hessian flow, to efficiently\\ncompute a solution. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach\\nthrough examples in urban traffic management, including routing for diverse\\nvehicle types and strategies for minimizing emissions in congested\\nenvironments.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.MA,cs.SY,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T16:45:29Z\"}"}
