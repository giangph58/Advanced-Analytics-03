One challenge in studying and\\ninterpreting the dynamics of binary black hole collisions is the intrinsically\\ngeometrical nature of spacetime, which in many ways is unlike that of other\\nclassical field theories. By exactly recasting Einstein's equations into a set\\nof coupled nonlinear Maxwell equations closely resembling classical\\nelectrodynamics, we visualize the intricate dynamics of gravitational electric\\nand magnetic fields during inspiral, merger and ring-down of a binary black\\nhole collision.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.HE,hep-th,physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T15:27:20Z\"}"}
