{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16044v1\", \"title\": \"Search for Axionlike Dark Matter Using Liquid-State Nuclear Magnetic\\n  Resonance\", \"summary\": \"We search for dark matter in the form of axionlike particles (ALPs) in the\\nmass range $5.576741 \\\\,\\\\mathrm{neV/c^2}$ - $5.577733\\\\,\\\\mathrm{neV/c^2}$ by\\nprobing their possible coupling to fermion spins through the ALP field\\ngradient. This is achieved by performing proton nuclear magnetic resonance\\nspectroscopy on a sample of methanol as a technical demonstration of the Cosmic\\nAxion Spin Precession Experiment Gradient (CASPEr-Gradient) Low-Field\\napparatus. Searching for spin-coupled ALP dark matter in this mass range with\\nassociated Compton frequencies in a 240 Hz window centered at 1.348570 MHz\\nresulted in a sensitivity to the ALP-proton coupling constant of\\n$g_{\\\\mathrm{ap}} \\\\approx 3 \\\\times 10^{-2}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$. This\\nnarrow-bandwidth search serves as a proof-of-principle and a commissioning\\nmeasurement, validating our methodology and demonstrating the experiment's\\ncapabilities. It opens the door to probing large swaths of hitherto unexplored\\nmass-coupling parameter space in the future by using hyperpolarized samples.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex,physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T17:11:01Z\"}"}
