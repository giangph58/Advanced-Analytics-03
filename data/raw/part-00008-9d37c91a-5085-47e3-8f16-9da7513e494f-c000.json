{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11438v1\", \"title\": \"Mamba-Based Ensemble learning for White Blood Cell Classification\", \"summary\": \"White blood cell (WBC) classification assists in assessing immune health and\\ndiagnosing various diseases, yet manual classification is labor-intensive and\\nprone to inconsistencies. Recent advancements in deep learning have shown\\npromise over traditional methods; however, challenges such as data imbalance\\nand the computational demands of modern technologies, such as Transformer-based\\nmodels which do not scale well with input size, limit their practical\\napplication. This paper introduces a novel framework that leverages Mamba\\nmodels integrated with ensemble learning to improve WBC classification. Mamba\\nmodels, known for their linear complexity, provide a scalable alternative to\\nTransformer-based approaches, making them suitable for deployment in\\nresource-constrained environments. Additionally, we introduce a new WBC\\ndataset, Chula-WBC-8, for benchmarking. Our approach not only validates the\\neffectiveness of Mamba models in this domain but also demonstrates their\\npotential to significantly enhance classification efficiency without\\ncompromising accuracy.
