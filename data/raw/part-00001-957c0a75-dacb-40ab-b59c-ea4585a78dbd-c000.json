This study explores 6H-SiC bicrystals under shock waves via\\nlarge-scale molecular dynamics simulations. We focused on symmetric tilt grain\\nboundaries with a wide range of misorientations and found that spall strength\\nand dynamical fracture surface energy are strongly affected by the grain\\nboundary microstructure, especially the excess free volume. Grain boundary\\nenergy also plays a considerable role. As expected, low-angle grain boundaries\\ntend to have higher spallation strengths. We also extracted cohesive models for\\nthe dynamical strength of bulk systems and grain boundaries that can be used in\\ncontinuum simulations.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T17:16:44Z\"}"}
