{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14900v1\", \"title\": \"Distributed Time-Varying Gaussian Regression via Kalman Filtering\", \"summary\": \"We consider the problem of learning time-varying functions in a distributed\\nfashion, where agents collect local information to collaboratively achieve a\\nshared estimate. This task is particularly relevant in control applications,\\nwhenever real-time and robust estimation of dynamic cost/reward functions in\\nsafety critical settings has to be performed. In this paper, we,adopt a\\nfinite-dimensional approximation of a Gaussian Process, corresponding to a\\nBayesian linear regression in an appropriate feature space, and propose a new\\nalgorithm, DistKP, to track the time-varying coefficients via a distributed\\nKalman filter. The proposed method works for arbitrary kernels and under weaker\\nassumptions on the time-evolution of the function to learn compared to the\\nliterature. We validate our results using a simulation example in which a fleet\\nof Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) learns a dynamically changing wind field.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T07:12:05Z\"}"}
