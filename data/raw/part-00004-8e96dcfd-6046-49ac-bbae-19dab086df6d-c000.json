This paper introduces a data-driven approach that predicts\\nmanufacturing steps and their durations directly from a product's 3D model. By\\nrendering the model into multiple 2D images and leveraging a neural network\\ninspired by the Generative Query Network, the method learns to map geometric\\nfeatures into time estimates for predefined production steps enabling scalable,\\nadaptive, and precise process planning across varied product types.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,I.2.10\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:45:44Z\"}"}
