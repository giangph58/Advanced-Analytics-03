We show that majorizations in general can be\\nreduced to these sets. We characterize linear operators that preserve\\nmajorization for probability distributions, and show their equivalence to\\noperators preserving vector majorization. Our main result provides a complete\\ncharacterization of linear preservers of strong majorization for column\\nstochastic matrices, revealing a richer structure of preservers, than in the\\nstandard setting. As a prerequisite to this characterization, we solve the\\nproblem of characterizing linear preservers of majorization for zero-sum\\nvectors, which yields a new structural insight into the classical results of\\nAndo and of Li and Poon.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RA\", \"categories\": \"math.RA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T16:29:54Z\"}"}
