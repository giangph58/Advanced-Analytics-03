Even minor advancements\\nin this model continue to captivate scientists worldwide, and small\\nmodifications often intrigue researchers from different disciplines. This paper\\ninvestigates a one-dimensional \\\\(q\\\\)-state modified Potts model influenced by\\nan external magnetic field. By leveraging the transfer matrix method, exact\\nexpressions are derived for key thermodynamic quantities, including free\\nenergy, entropy, magnetization, susceptibility, and specific heat capacity.\\nNumerical analyses explore how these thermodynamic functions vary with relevant\\nparameters, offering insights into the system's behavior. Additionally, the\\nasymptotic properties of these quantities are examined in the limiting cases\\n\\\\(T \\\\to 0\\\\) and \\\\(T \\\\to \\\\infty\\\\). The findings contribute to a deeper\\nunderstanding of the model's thermodynamic characteristics and highlight its\\npotential applications across various disciplines.\", \"main_category\": \"math-ph\", \"categories\": \"math-ph,cond-mat.stat-mech,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:40:18Z\"}"}
