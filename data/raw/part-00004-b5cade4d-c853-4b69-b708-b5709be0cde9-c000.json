They presented several interesting results and posed\\nquestions regarding combinatorial proofs for these identities. In this paper,\\nwe establish bijections to provide combinatorial proofs for these results.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T09:22:15Z\"}"}
