{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05331v1\", \"title\": \"Aesthetics Without Semantics\", \"summary\": \"While it is easy for human observers to judge an image as beautiful or ugly,\\naesthetic decisions result from a combination of entangled perceptual and\\ncognitive (semantic) factors, making the understanding of aesthetic judgements\\nparticularly challenging from a scientific point of view. Furthermore, our\\nresearch shows a prevailing bias in current databases, which include mostly\\nbeautiful images, further complicating the study and prediction of aesthetic\\nresponses. We address these limitations by creating a database of images with\\nminimal semantic content and devising, and next exploiting, a method to\\ngenerate images on the ugly side of aesthetic valuations. The resulting Minimum\\nSemantic Content (MSC) database consists of a large and balanced collection of\\n10,426 images, each evaluated by 100 observers. We next use established image\\nmetrics to demonstrate how augmenting an image set biased towards beautiful\\nimages with ugly images can modify, or even invert, an observed relationship\\nbetween image features and aesthetics valuation. Taken together, our study\\nreveals that works in empirical aesthetics attempting to link image content and\\naesthetic judgements may magnify, underestimate, or simply miss interesting\\neffects due to a limitation of the range of aesthetic values they consider.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,q-bio.NC,stat.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:22:11Z\"}"}
