{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07758v1\", \"title\": \"PIDSR:ComplementaryPolarizedImageDemosaicingandSuper-Resolution\", \"summary\": \"Polarization cameras can capture multiple polarized images with different\\npolarizer angles in a single shot, bringing convenience to polarization-based\\ndownstream tasks. However, their direct outputs are color-polarization filter\\narray (CPFA) raw images, requiring demosaicing to reconstruct full-resolution,\\nfull-color polarized images; unfortunately, this necessary step introduces\\nartifacts that make polarization-related parameters such as the degree of\\npolarization (DoP) and angle of polarization (AoP) prone to error. Besides,\\nlimited by the hardware design, the resolution of a polarization camera is\\noften much lower than that of a conventional RGB camera. Existing polarized\\nimage demosaicing (PID) methods are limited in that they cannot enhance\\nresolution, while polarized image super-resolution (PISR) methods, though\\ndesigned to obtain high-resolution (HR) polarized images from the demosaicing\\nresults, tend to retain or even amplify errors in the DoP and AoP introduced by\\ndemosaicing artifacts. In this paper, we propose PIDSR, a joint framework that\\nperforms complementary Polarized Image Demosaicing and Super-Resolution,\\nshowing the ability to robustly obtain high-quality HR polarized images with\\nmore accurate DoP and AoP from a CPFA raw image in a direct manner. Experiments\\nshow our PIDSR not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic\\nand real data, but also facilitates downstream tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,eess.IV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T13:56:33Z\"}"}
