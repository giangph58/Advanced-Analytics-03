{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15213v1\", \"title\": \"Community detection in hypergraphs through hyperedge percolation\", \"summary\": \"Complex networks, representing the connections between the constituents of\\nlarge complex systems, are often characterised by a community structure, with\\ncommunities corresponding to denser sub-graphs in which nodes are closely\\nlinked. When modelling systems where interactions extend beyond node pairs to\\ninvolve arbitrary numbers of nodes, hypergraphs become necessary, creating a\\nneed for specialised community detection methods. Here, we adapt the classical\\n$k$-clique percolation method to hypergraphs, building communities from\\nhyperedges containing at least $k$ nodes, defining hyperedge adjacency\\nsimilarly to clique adjacency in the original algorithm. Although the analogy\\nbetween the proposed hyperedge percolation method and the classical clique\\npercolation algorithm is evident, we show that communities obtained directly\\nfrom the hyperedges can differ from those identified by the clique percolation\\nmethod in the pairwise projection of the hypergraph. We also propose an\\nalternative way for uniting hyperedges into communities, where instead of\\nlimiting the cardinality of the considered hyperedges from below, we restrict\\nthe size of the largest hyperedges that can be added to a community. This\\nalternative algorithm is better suited to hypergraphs where larger edges\\nrealise weaker linkages between the nodes. After comparing the suggested two\\napproaches on simple synthetic hypergraphs constructed to highlight their\\ndifferences, we test them on hypergraphs generated with a newly proposed\\ngeometric process on the hyperbolic plane, as well as on some real-world\\nexamples.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T16:35:24Z\"}"}
