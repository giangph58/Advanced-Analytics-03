{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20526v1\", \"title\": \"Histogram-Probabilistic Multi-Hypothesis Tracking with Integrated Target\\n  Existence\", \"summary\": \"The histogram-probabilistic multi-hypothesis tracker (H-PMHT) is a parametric\\napproach to solving the multi-target track-before-detect (TBD) problem, using\\nexpectation maximisation (EM). A key limitation of this method is the\\nassumption of a known and constant number of targets. In this paper, we propose\\nthe integrated existence Poisson histogram probabilistic multi-hypothesis\\ntracker (IE-PHPMHT), for TBD of multiple targets. It extends the H-PMHT\\nframework by adding a probability of existence to each potential target. For\\nthe derivation, we utilise a Poisson point process (PPP) measurement model and\\nBernoulli targets, allowing for a multi-Bernoulli birth process and an unknown,\\ntime-varying number of targets. Hence, integrated track management is achieved\\nthrough the discrimination of track quality assessments based on existence\\nprobabilities. The algorithm is evaluated in a simulation study of two\\nscenarios and is compared with several other algorithms, demonstrating its\\nperformance.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T08:12:07Z\"}"}
