{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10364v1\", \"title\": \"Widely FSR tunable high Q-factor microresonators formed at the\\n  intersection of straight optical fibers\", \"summary\": \"We present a new class of high-Q tunable microresonators formed at the\\nintersection of two straight silica optical fibers, whose free spectral range\\n(FSR) can be widely tuned by fiber rotation. The proposed configuration avoids\\nthe limitations of traditional monolithic microresonators that lack FSR\\ntunability required for a wide range of photonic applications. Using small\\nrotation angles (1-15 mrad), we demonstrate a tunability of the FSR from 2 pm\\nto 10 pm, enabled by microscale fiber displacements that reshape the resonator\\nprofile over millimeter scales. The proposed approach minimizes mechanical\\nstress, supports miniaturization, and is suitable for integration with MEMS. It\\npaves the way for the fabrication of tunable delay lines, ultralow repetition\\nrate broadband frequency comb generators, and nonlocal optofluidic sensors on a\\nchip.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:10:08Z\"}"}
