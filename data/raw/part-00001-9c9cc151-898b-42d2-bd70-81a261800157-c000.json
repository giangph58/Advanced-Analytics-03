{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00684v1\", \"title\": \"Visual Test-time Scaling for GUI Agent Grounding\", \"summary\": \"We introduce RegionFocus, a visual test-time scaling approach for Vision\\nLanguage Model Agents. Understanding webpages is challenging due to the visual\\ncomplexity of GUI images and the large number of interface elements, making\\naccurate action selection difficult. Our approach dynamically zooms in on\\nrelevant regions, reducing background clutter and improving grounding accuracy.\\nTo support this process, we propose an image-as-map mechanism that visualizes\\nkey landmarks at each step, providing a transparent action record and enables\\nthe agent to effectively choose among action candidates. Even with a simple\\nregion selection strategy, we observe significant performance gains of 28+\\\\% on\\nScreenspot-pro and 24+\\\\% on WebVoyager benchmarks on top of two\\nstate-of-the-art open vision language model agents, UI-TARS and Qwen2.5-VL,\\nhighlighting the effectiveness of visual test-time scaling in interactive\\nsettings. We achieve a new state-of-the-art grounding performance of 61.6\\\\% on\\nthe ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark by applying RegionFocus to a Qwen2.5-VL-72B model.\\nOur code will be released publicly at https://github.com/tiangeluo/RegionFocus.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T17:45:59Z\"}"}
