{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15774v1\", \"title\": \"Performance Analysis of IEEE 802.11bn Non-Primary Channel Access\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents a performance analysis of the Non-Primary Channel Access\\n(NPCA) mechanism, a new feature introduced in IEEE 802.11bn to enhance spectrum\\nutilization in Wi-Fi networks. NPCA enables devices to contend for and transmit\\non the secondary channel when the primary channel is occupied by transmissions\\nfrom an Overlapping Basic Service Set (OBSS). We develop a Continuous-Time\\nMarkov Chain (CTMC) model that captures the interactions among OBSSs in dense\\nWLAN environments when NPCA is enabled, incorporating new NPCA-specific states\\nand transitions. In addition to the analytical insights offered by the model,\\nwe conduct numerical evaluations and simulations to quantify NPCA's impact on\\nthroughput and channel access delay across various scenarios. Our results show\\nthat NPCA can significantly improve throughput and reduce access delays in\\nfavorable conditions for BSSs that support the mechanism. Moreover, NPCA helps\\nmitigate the OBSS performance anomaly, where low-rate OBSS transmissions\\ndegrade network performance for all nearby devices. However, we also observe\\ntrade-offs: NPCA may increase contention on secondary channels, potentially\\nreducing transmission opportunities for BSSs operating there.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T10:30:15Z\"}"}
