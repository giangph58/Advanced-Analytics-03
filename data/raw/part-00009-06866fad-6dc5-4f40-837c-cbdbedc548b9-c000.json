{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21631v1\", \"title\": \"Skin Effect Induced Anomalous Dynamics from Charge-Fluctuating Initial\\n  States\", \"summary\": \"Non-equilibrium dynamics in non-Hermitian systems has attracted significant\\ninterest, particularly due to the skin effect and its associated anomalous\\nphenomena. Previous studies have primarily focused on initial states with a\\ndefinite particle number. Here, we present a systematic study of non-reciprocal\\nquench dynamics in the pairing states with indefinite particle number. Our\\nstudy uncovers a range of novel behaviors. Firstly, we demonstrate a universal\\ntendency towards half-filling of particle density at late times. At early times\\nfor certain initial states, we observe a chiral wavefront in both particle\\nnumber distribution and charge inflow, associated with a sharp decrease in\\nparticle number. Furthermore, we find that non-Hermiticity could enhance the\\ngrowth of entanglement in the initial stages of evolution. In the intermediate\\ntime regime, the characteristic skin effect leads to particle accumulation on\\none side, leading to a pronounced reduction in entanglement entropy. Moreover,\\nour results reveal the presence of the quantum Mpemba effect during the\\nrestoration of U(1) symmetry. Our findings open new avenues for exploring\\nexotic dynamic phenomena in quantum many-body systems arising from the\\ninterplay of symmetry breaking and non-Hermiticity.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.quant-gas,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T13:33:10Z\"}"}
