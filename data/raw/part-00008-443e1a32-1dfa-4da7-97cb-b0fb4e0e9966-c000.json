In order to grow a variety of structures, a versatile deposition\\ntool such as molecular beam epitaxy has to be employed. In this work, molecular\\nbeam epitaxy growth of BaBiO3 on SrTiO3(001) and MgO(001) substrates is\\nstudied. When grown by molecular beam epitaxy on SrTiO3(001) or MgO(001)\\nsubstrates, BaBiO3 is known to have two competing orientations namely, (001)\\nand (011). Characterization of the thin film is carried out by X-ray\\ndiffraction, X-ray reflectivity, atomic force microscopy, Rutherford\\nbackscattering, and transmission electron microscopy. Pathways to block the\\ngrowth of BaBiO3(011) and only grow the technologically relevant BaBiO3(001)\\nare described for both substrates. Understanding of the enabler mechanism of\\nthe co-growth is established from epitaxy point of view. This can be\\nbeneficially utilized for growth of the different compositions of BaBiO3\\nmaterial family in a more controlled manner.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:28:24Z\"}"}
