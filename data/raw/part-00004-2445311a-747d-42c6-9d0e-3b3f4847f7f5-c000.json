In this study, we revisit the XMCD and XMLD sum rules within a complete\\nmagnetic multipole basis that incorporates both spinless and spinful\\nmultipoles. We demonstrate that these multipoles can be clearly distinguished\\nand individually detected through the sum-rule formalism. Within this\\nframework, the anisotropic magnetic dipole term is naturally derived in XMCD,\\noffering a microscopic origin for ferromagnetic-like behavior in\\nantiferromagnets. Furthermore, we derive the sum rules for out-of-plane and\\nin-plane XMLD regarding electric quadrupole contributions defined based on the\\ncomplete multipole basis. Our theoretical approach provides a unified,\\nsymmetry-consistent framework for analyzing dichroic signals in various\\nmagnetic materials. These findings deepen the understanding of XMCD and XMLD\\nand open pathways to exploring complex magnetic structures and spin-orbit\\ncoupling effects in emergent magnetic materials.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T07:14:46Z\"}"}
