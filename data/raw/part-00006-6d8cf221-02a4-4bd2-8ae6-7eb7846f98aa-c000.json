The bound\\n$n-1$ on the sum is best possible in general. Our result verifies the\\nmultiplicity extension of the Ryser-Brualdi-Stein Conjecture, proposed recently\\nby Anastos, Fabian, M\\\\\\\"uyesser, and Szab\\\\'o, for three colors.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T15:22:13Z\"}"}
