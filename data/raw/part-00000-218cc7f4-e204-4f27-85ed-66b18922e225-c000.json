By\\ninvestigating 1D spinful Hatano-Nelson model with Abelian gauge fields we\\nuncover a tunable, unconventional spin-polarized NHSE with zero spectral\\nwinding, coexisting with a bidirectional conventional NHSE exhibiting nonzero\\nwinding. The unconventional skin modes display scale-restricted localization,\\ndistinguishing them from the critical NHSE. Upon introducing an external\\nmagnetic field coupled to the spin degrees of freedom, these unconventional\\nskin modes are suppressed, leading to spectral instability and the emergence of\\ncritical NHSE with system size-dependent non-Bloch spectra. Meanwhile,\\nconventional skin modes persist, but undergo a transition from bidirectional to\\nunidirectional accumulation. Our results provide experimentally accessible\\npredictions, relevant to photonic lattices and ultracold atomic systems with\\nsynthetic gauge fields.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T17:49:23Z\"}"}
