{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17426v1\", \"title\": \"Towards Leveraging Large Language Model Summaries for Topic Modeling in\\n  Source Code\", \"summary\": \"Understanding source code is a topic of great interest in the software\\nengineering community, since it can help programmers in various tasks such as\\nsoftware maintenance and reuse. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs)\\nhave demonstrated remarkable program comprehension capabilities, while\\ntransformer-based topic modeling techniques offer effective ways to extract\\nsemantic information from text. This paper proposes and explores a novel\\napproach that combines these strengths to automatically identify meaningful\\ntopics in a corpus of Python programs. Our method consists in applying topic\\nmodeling on the descriptions obtained by asking an LLM to summarize the code.\\nTo assess the internal consistency of the extracted topics, we compare them\\nagainst topics inferred from function names alone, and those derived from\\nexisting docstrings. Experimental results suggest that leveraging LLM-generated\\nsummaries provides interpretable and semantically rich representation of code\\nstructure. The promising results suggest that our approach can be fruitfully\\napplied in various software engineering tasks such as automatic documentation\\nand tagging, code search, software reorganization and knowledge discovery in\\nlarge repositories.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T10:30:40Z\"}"}
