Prior work, such as LangSplat, addressed this task by\\nretrieving these regions in the form of segmentation masks on 2D renderings.\\nMore recently, OpenGaussian introduced point-level querying, which directly\\nselects a subset of 3D Gaussians. In this work, we propose a point-level\\nquerying method that builds upon LangSplat's framework. Our approach improves\\nthe framework in two key ways: (a) we leverage masklets from the Segment\\nAnything Model 2 (SAM2) to establish semantic consistent ground-truth for\\ndistilling the language Gaussians; (b) we introduces a novel two-step querying\\napproach that first retrieves the distilled ground-truth and subsequently uses\\nthe ground-truth to query the individual Gaussians. Experimental evaluations on\\nthree benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better\\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art approaches. For instance, our method\\nachieves an mIoU improvement of +20.42 on the 3D-OVS dataset.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:59:05Z\"}"}
