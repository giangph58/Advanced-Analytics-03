{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20819v1\", \"title\": \"Quantum Signature of Anisotropic Singularities in Hydrogen Bond Breaking\\n  of Water Dimer\", \"summary\": \"In all standard force field-based simulations of organic, bio-molecules,\\npolymers; the torsion angle based Hamiltonian has been an indispensable term to\\nset up molecular simulation. Torsion often termed as a dihedral angle, the\\ncoordinate assumes a continuous molecular geometry and energy changes for an\\nangle range from 0 to 360 degrees. However, quantum mechanics-based results\\npresented earlier and in this report show electronic energy will have\\nsingularities due to molecular geometry criticality, and torsion based\\nelectrotonic energy is not a smooth function of (r, theta) due to bond-breaking\\ngeometry. Contrast to force field or molecular mechanics based results of\\ngeometrical and energy continuity, continuum of geometry under torsion is not\\nfeasible as per quantum mechanical electronic energy computations. This feature\\nof electronic energy is readily observed for weakly H-bonded and VDW dimers.\\n  Applying the ab initio methods of Hartree-Fock, Density Functional as well as\\nMoller-Plesset, we have reconfirmed the previous general predictions of\\nelectronic energy singularities with torsion angle variation around weak H-bond\\nequilibrium and beyond for water dimer. Due to the quantum nature of the weak\\nchemical bond breaking process leading to break-point conditions in molecules,\\nthe singularities in electronic energy is observed contrast to molecular\\nmechanics results. These overlooked results of quantum energy singularities can\\nbe useful to improve the current bio-molecular force field and reaction\\nchemistry dynamics involving bond-breaking process.\\n  Hypothesis tested: https://zenodo.org/records/12730902\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:39:24Z\"}"}
