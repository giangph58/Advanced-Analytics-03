{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05881v1\", \"title\": \"Actuarial Learning for Pension Fund Mortality Forecasting\", \"summary\": \"For the assessment of the financial soundness of a pension fund, it is\\nnecessary to take into account mortality forecasting so that longevity risk is\\nconsistently incorporated into future cash flows. In this article, we employ\\nmachine learning models applied to actuarial science ({\\\\it actuarial learning})\\nto make mortality predictions for a relevant sample of pension funds'\\nparticipants. Actuarial learning represents an emerging field that involves the\\napplication of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)\\ntechniques in actuarial science. This encompasses the use of algorithms and\\ncomputational models to analyze large sets of actuarial data, such as\\nregression trees, random forest, boosting, XGBoost, CatBoost, and neural\\nnetworks (eg. FNN, LSTM, and MHA). Our results indicate that some ML/AI\\nalgorithms present competitive out-of-sample performance when compared to the\\nclassical Lee-Carter model. This may indicate interesting alternatives for\\nconsistent liability evaluation and effective pension fund risk management.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ML\", \"categories\": \"stat.ML,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T10:09:41Z\"}"}
