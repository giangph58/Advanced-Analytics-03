{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15730v1\", \"title\": \"Enhancing Radiation Hardness and Granularity in HV-CMOS: The RD50-MPW4\\n  Sensor\", \"summary\": \"The latest HV-CMOS pixel sensor developed by the former CERN-RD50-CMOS group,\\nknown as the \\\\mpw, demonstrates competitive radiation tolerance, spatial\\ngranularity, and timing resolution -- key requirements for future high-energy\\nphysics experiments such as the HL-LHC and FCC. Fabricated using a \\\\SI{150}{nm}\\nCMOS process by \\\\emph{LFoundry}, it introduces several improvements over its\\npredecessor, the \\\\emph{RD50-MPW3}, including separated power domains for\\nreduced noise, a new backside biasing scheme, and an enhanced guard ring\\nstructure, enabling operation at bias voltages up to \\\\SI{800}{V}.\\n  Tests with non-irradiated samples achieved hit detection efficiencies\\nexceeding \\\\SI{99.9}{\\\\%} and a spatial resolution around \\\\SI{16}{\\\\mu m}.\\nNeutron-irradiated sensors were characterized using IV measurements and\\ntest-beam campaigns, confirming the sensor's robustness in high-radiation\\nenvironments. The results highlight the ability of HV-CMOS technology to\\nrestore hit detection efficiency post-irradiation by increasing the applied\\nbias voltage. Details of these measurements and timing performance are\\npresented in this paper.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T09:24:13Z\"}"}
