In previous works, it was observed that, amid\\nthe three components, GaInP subcells are more prone to degrade when reverse\\nbiased suffering permanent damage, although they present an initial good\\nperformance. The aim of this work is, firstly, to study the characteristics of\\nthe defects that cause the catastrophic failure of the devices. For this, GaInP\\nisotype solar cells were analysed by visual inspection and electroluminescence\\nmaps and submitted to reverse bias stress test. We find that specific growth\\ndefects (i.e. hillocks), when covered with metal, cause the degradation in the\\ncells. SEM cross-section imaging and EDX compositional analysis of these\\ndefects reveal their complex structures, which in essence consist of material\\nabnormally grown on and around particles present on the wafer surface before\\ngrowth. The reverse bias stress test is proposed as a screening method to spot\\ndefects hidden under the metal that may not be detected by conventional\\nscreening methods. By applying a quick reverse bias stress test, we can detect\\nthose defects that cause the degradation of devices at voltages below the\\nbreakdown voltage and that may also affect their long-term reliability.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T14:36:26Z\"}"}
