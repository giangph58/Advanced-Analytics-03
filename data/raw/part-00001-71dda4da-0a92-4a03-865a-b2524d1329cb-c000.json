In comparison to the standard lattice\\nDirac operator index, our formulation does not require the Ginsparg-Wilson\\nrelation and has broader applicability to systems with boundaries and to the\\nmod-two version of the indices in general dimensions. We numerically verify\\nthat the $K$ and $KO$ group formulas reproduce the known index theorems in\\ncontinuum theory. We examine the Atiyah-Singer index on a flat two-dimensional\\ntorus and, for the first time, demonstrate that the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index\\nwith nontrivial curved boundaries, as well as the mod-two versions, can be\\ncomputed on a lattice.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,hep-lat,math.KT\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T10:11:44Z\"}"}
