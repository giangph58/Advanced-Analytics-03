Yet, in the noisy intermediate scale quantum\\n(NISQ) era, we are limited to shallow circuits on the order of a thousand\\nlayers. Thus, accurate and efficient state preparation methods are needed. We\\nintroduce a simplified fermionic scattering state preparation method that\\nreduces circuit depth significantly by partially relaxing the fermionic\\ncondition. Using the 1+1D transverse field Ising model as our test bed with\\nexact diagonalization and time evolving block decimation with matrix product\\nstates, we show that our simplified states retain nearly all of the behavior of\\nthe true fermionic state while being prepared on just a handful of qubits. We\\nalso show promising early results on IonQ Forte 1.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T12:03:58Z\"}"}
