{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13076v1\", \"title\": \"Extremal Lagrangian tori in toric domains\", \"summary\": \"Let $L$ be a closed Lagrangian submanifold of a symplectic manifold\\n$(X,\\\\omega)$. Cieliebak and Mohnke define the symplectic area of $L$ as the\\nminimal positive symplectic area of a smooth $2$-disk in $X$ with boundary on\\n$L$. An extremal Lagrangian torus in $(X,\\\\omega)$ is a Lagrangian torus that\\nmaximizes the symplectic area among the Lagrangian tori in $(X,\\\\omega)$. We\\nprove that every extremal Lagrangian torus in the symplectic unit ball\\n$(\\\\bar{B}^{2n}(1),\\\\omega_{\\\\mathrm{std}})$ is contained entirely in the boundary\\n$\\\\partial B^{2n}(1)$. This answers a question attributed to Lazzarini and\\ncompletely settles a conjecture of Cieliebak and Mohnke in the affirmative. In\\naddition, we prove the conjecture for a class of toric domains in\\n$(\\\\mathbb{C}^n, \\\\omega_{\\\\mathrm{std}})$, which includes all compact strictly\\nconvex four-dimensional toric domains. We explain with counterexamples that the\\ngeneral conjecture does not hold for non-convex domains.\", \"main_category\": \"math.SG\", \"categories\": \"math.SG,math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T16:39:04Z\"}"}
