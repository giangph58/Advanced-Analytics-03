Unlike administrative or dating app data, IBJ provides full search,\\ndating, and matching logs based on verified profiles and confirmed engagements.\\nUsers are highly selected into serious marriage search via costly screening.\\nCovering 3.3% of national marriages annually, the data offer rare behavioral\\ngranularity. Using a nonparametric approach, I estimate time-varying matching\\nfunctions and elasticities. Efficiency rises fourfold over time, illustrating\\nhow digital intermediation transforms partner search in modern marriage\\nmarkets.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T15:36:50Z\"}"}
