{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05986v1\", \"title\": \"Nehari's Theorem for Schatten class Hankel operators for convex domains\", \"summary\": \"Recently it was proven that for a convex subset of $\\\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ that has\\ninfinitely many extreme vectors, the Nehari theorem fails, that is, there\\nexists a bounded Hankel operator $H_{\\\\phi}$ on the Paley--Wiener space\\n$PW(\\\\Omega)$ that does not admit a bounded symbol. In this paper we examine\\nwhether Nehari's theorem can hold under the stronger assumption that the Hankel\\noperator $H_{\\\\phi}$ is in the Schatten class $S^{p}(PW(\\\\Omega))$. We prove that\\nthis fails for $p>4$ for any convex subset of $\\\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, $n\\\\geq2$, of\\nboundary with a $C^{2}$ neighborhood of nonzero curvature. Furthermore we prove\\nthat for a simple polytope $P$ in $\\\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, the inequality\\n$$\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^{n}}\\\\dfrac{|\\\\widehat{f}(x)|^{2}}{m(P\\\\cap (x-P))}dx\\\\leq\\nC\\\\|f\\\\|_{L^{1}}^{2},$$ holds for all $f\\\\in PW^{1}(2P)$, and consequently any\\nHilbert--Schmidt Hankel operator on a Paley--Wiener space of a simple polytope\\nis generated by a bounded function.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:48:16Z\"}"}
