{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10915v1\", \"title\": \"LOKA Protocol: A Decentralized Framework for Trustworthy and Ethical AI\\n  Agent Ecosystems\", \"summary\": \"The rise of autonomous AI agents, capable of perceiving, reasoning, and\\nacting independently, signals a profound shift in how digital ecosystems\\noperate, govern, and evolve. As these agents proliferate beyond centralized\\ninfrastructures, they expose foundational gaps in identity, accountability, and\\nethical alignment. Three critical questions emerge: Identity: Who or what is\\nthe agent? Accountability: Can its actions be verified, audited, and trusted?\\nEthical Consensus: Can autonomous systems reliably align with human values and\\nprevent harmful emergent behaviors? We present the novel LOKA Protocol (Layered\\nOrchestration for Knowledgeful Agents), a unified, systems-level architecture\\nfor building ethically governed, interoperable AI agent ecosystems. LOKA\\nintroduces a proposed Universal Agent Identity Layer (UAIL) for decentralized,\\nverifiable identity; intent-centric communication protocols for semantic\\ncoordination across diverse agents; and a Decentralized Ethical Consensus\\nProtocol (DECP) that enables agents to make context-aware decisions grounded in\\nshared ethical baselines. Anchored in emerging standards such as Decentralized\\nIdentifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), and post-quantum\\ncryptography, LOKA offers a scalable, future-resilient blueprint for\\nmulti-agent AI governance. By embedding identity, trust, and ethics into the\\nprotocol layer itself, LOKA establishes the foundation for a new era of\\nresponsible, transparent, and autonomous AI ecosystems operating across digital\\nand physical domains.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MA\", \"categories\": \"cs.MA,cs.AI,cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T06:51:35Z\"}"}
