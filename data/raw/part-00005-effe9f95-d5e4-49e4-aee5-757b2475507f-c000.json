{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00303v1\", \"title\": \"Leveraging Surplus Electricity: Profitability of Bitcoin Mining as a\\n  National Strategy in South Korea\", \"summary\": \"This study examines the feasibility and profitability of utilizing surplus\\nelectricity for Bitcoin mining. Surplus electricity refers to the remaining\\nelectricity after net metering, which can be repurposed for Bitcoin mining to\\nimprove Korea Electric Power Corporation's (KEPCO) energy resource efficiency\\nand alleviate its debt challenges. Net metering (or net energy metering) is an\\nelectricity billing mechanism that allows consumers who generate some or all of\\ntheir own electricity to use that electricity when they want, rather than when\\nit is produced. Using the latest Bitcoin miner, the Antminer S21 XP Hyd, the\\nstudy evaluates daily Bitcoin mining when operating at 30,565 and 45,439 units,\\nincorporating Bitcoin network hash rates to assess profitability. To examine\\nprofitability, the Random Forest Regressor and Long Short-Term Memory models\\nwere used to predict the Bitcoin price. The analysis shows that the use of\\nexcess electricity for Bitcoin mining not only generates economic revenue, but\\nalso minimizes energy loss, reduces debt, and resolves unsettled payment issues\\nfor KEPCO. This study empirically investigates and analyzes the integration of\\nelectricity surplus in South Korea with bitcoin mining for the first time. The\\nfindings highlight the potential to strengthen the financial stability of KEPCO\\nand demonstrate the feasibility of Bitcoin mining. In addition, this research\\nserves as a foundational resource for future advancements in the Bitcoin mining\\nindustry and the efficient use of energy resources.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T04:52:33Z\"}"}
