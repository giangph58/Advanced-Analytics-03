The strongest spectral features, including\\nDMS, look approximately Gaussian. Here, I perform a suite of Gaussian feature\\nanalyses to find any statistically significant spectral features in the\\nrecently published MIRI/LRS spectrum of K2-18b (N. Madhusudhan et al. 2025). In\\nN. Madhusudhan et al. 2025, they claim a 3.4-$\\\\sigma$ detection of spectral\\nfeatures compared to a flat line. In 5 out of 6 tests, I find the data\\npreferred a flat line over a Gaussian model, with a $\\\\chi^{2}_{\\\\nu}$ of 1.06.\\nWhen centering the Gaussian where the absorptions for DMS and DMDS peak, I find\\nln(B) = 1.21 in favour of the Gaussian model, with a $\\\\chi^{2}_{\\\\nu}$ of 0.99.\\nWith only $\\\\sim$2-$\\\\sigma$ in favour of Gaussian features, I conclude no strong\\nstatistical evidence for spectral features.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T14:02:56Z\"}"}
