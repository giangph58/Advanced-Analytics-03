{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10113v1\", \"title\": \"Unveiling Contrastive Learning's Capability of Neighborhood Aggregation\\n  for Collaborative Filtering\", \"summary\": \"Personalized recommendation is widely used in the web applications, and graph\\ncontrastive learning (GCL) has gradually become a dominant approach in\\nrecommender systems, primarily due to its ability to extract self-supervised\\nsignals from raw interaction data, effectively alleviating the problem of data\\nsparsity. A classic GCL-based method typically uses data augmentation during\\ngraph convolution to generates more contrastive views, and performs contrast on\\nthese new views to obtain rich self-supervised signals. Despite this paradigm\\nis effective, the reasons behind the performance gains remain a mystery. In\\nthis paper, we first reveal via theoretical derivation that the gradient\\ndescent process of the CL objective is formally equivalent to graph\\nconvolution, which implies that CL objective inherently supports neighborhood\\naggregation on interaction graphs. We further substantiate this capability\\nthrough experimental validation and identify common misconceptions in the\\nselection of positive samples in previous methods, which limit the potential of\\nCL objective. Based on this discovery, we propose the Light Contrastive\\nCollaborative Filtering (LightCCF) method, which introduces a novel\\nneighborhood aggregation objective to bring users closer to all interacted\\nitems while pushing them away from other positive pairs, thus achieving\\nhigh-quality neighborhood aggregation with very low time complexity. On three\\nhighly sparse public datasets, the proposed method effectively aggregate\\nneighborhood information while preventing graph over-smoothing, demonstrating\\nsignificant improvements over existing GCL-based counterparts in both training\\nefficiency and recommendation accuracy. Our implementations are publicly\\naccessible.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T11:22:41Z\"}"}
