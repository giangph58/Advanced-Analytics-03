{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16399v1\", \"title\": \"Scalable and modular generation of multipartite entangled states through\\n  memory-enhanced fusion\", \"summary\": \"Efficient generation of large-scale multipartite entangled states is a\\ncritical but challenging task in quantum information processing. Although\\ngeneration of multipartite entanglement within a small set of individual qubits\\nhas been demonstrated, further scale-up in system size requires the connection\\nof smaller entangled states into a larger state in a scalable and modular\\nmanner. Here we achieve this goal by implementing memory-enhanced fusion of two\\nmultipartite entangled states via photonic interconnects. Through asynchronous\\npreparation of two tripartite W-state entanglements in two spatially-separated\\nmodules of atomic quantum memories and on-demand fusion via single-photon\\ninterference, we demonstrate the creation of a four-partite W-state\\nentanglement shared by two remote quantum memory modules in a heralded way. We\\nfurther transfer the W state from the memory qubits to the photonic qubits, and\\nconfirm the genuine four-partite entanglement through witness measurements. We\\nthen demonstrate memory-enhanced scaling in efficiencies in the entanglement\\nfusion. The demonstrated scalable generation and fusion of multipartite\\nentangled states pave the way towards realization of large-scale distributed\\nquantum information processing in the future.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T04:01:21Z\"}"}
