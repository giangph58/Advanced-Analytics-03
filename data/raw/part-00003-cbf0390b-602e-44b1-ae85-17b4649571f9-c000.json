For the particular case $d_k=1$, this leads to bounds\\non the rate of linear $q$-ary $k$-hash codes which generalize, with a simpler\\nproof, results recently obtained for the case $q=k=3$ by Pohoata and Zakharov\\nand by Bishnoi D'haeseleeer and Gijswijt. We finally discuss some related open\\nproblems on the list-decoding zero-error capacity of discrete memoryless\\nchannels.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.CO,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:34:02Z\"}"}
