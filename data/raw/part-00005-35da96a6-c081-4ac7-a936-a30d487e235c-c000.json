The completeness problem has been addressed in the\\nliterature for two limiting cases: the unimodular Lie group $\\\\mathrm{Sol}$ and\\nthe homothetic Lie group $\\\\mathrm{Ho}$. In this work, we solve the completeness\\nproblem of left-invariant Lorentzian metrics on the remaining Lie groups of the\\ngiven form. Moreover, we show that every 3-dimensional non-unimodular Lie group\\nhas an incomplete left-invariant metric.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T09:15:07Z\"}"}
