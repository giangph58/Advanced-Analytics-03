{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21638v1\", \"title\": \"A note on the quantum Wielandt inequality\", \"summary\": \"In this note, we show how to extend operator algebraic methods introduced by\\nRahaman to prove that the index of primitivity of any primitive Schwarz map is\\nat most $2(D-1)^2$, where $D$ is the dimension of the underlying matrix\\nalgebra. This inequality was first proved by Rahaman for Schwarz maps which\\nwere both unital and trace preserving. We show here that the assumption of\\nunitality is automatic (up to normalization) for primitive Schwarz maps, but,\\nin general, not all primitive unital Schwarz maps are trace preserving.\\nTherefore, the precise purpose of this note is to showcase how to apply the\\nproof of Rahaman to arbitrary primitive Schwarz maps. As a corollary of this\\ntheorem, we show that the index of primitivity of any primitive 2-positive map\\nis at most $2(D-1)^2$, so in particular this bound holds for arbitrary\\nprimitive completely positive maps. We briefly discuss of how this relates to a\\nconjecture of Perez-Garcia, Verstraete, Wolf and Cirac concerning properties of\\nparent Hamiltonians of matrix product states.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.IT,math.IT,math.OA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T13:40:53Z\"}"}
