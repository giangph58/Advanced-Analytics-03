{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16592v1\", \"title\": \"Algorithmic Pricing and Algorithmic Collusion\", \"summary\": \"The rise of algorithmic pricing in online retail platforms has attracted\\nsignificant interest in how autonomous software agents interact under\\ncompetition. This article explores the potential emergence of algorithmic\\ncollusion - supra-competitive pricing outcomes that arise without explicit\\nagreements - as a consequence of repeated interactions between learning agents.\\nMost of the literature focuses on oligopoly pricing environments modeled as\\nrepeated Bertrand competitions, where firms use online learning algorithms to\\nadapt prices over time. While experimental research has demonstrated that\\nspecific reinforcement learning algorithms can learn to maintain prices above\\ncompetitive equilibrium levels in simulated environments, theoretical\\nunderstanding of when and why such outcomes occur remains limited. This work\\nhighlights the interdisciplinary nature of this challenge, which connects\\ncomputer science concepts of online learning with game-theoretical literature\\non equilibrium learning. We examine implications for the Business & Information\\nSystems Engineering (BISE) community and identify specific research\\nopportunities to address challenges of algorithmic competition in digital\\nmarketplaces.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GT\", \"categories\": \"cs.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T10:18:57Z\"}"}
