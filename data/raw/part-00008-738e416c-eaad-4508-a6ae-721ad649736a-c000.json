MHD)\\nequations was first proposed by Klainerman--Majda in (Comm. Pure Appl. Math.\\n34: 481--524, 1981). Recently Ju--Wang--Xu mathematically verified that the\\n\\\\emph{local-in-time} solutions of three-dimensional (abbr. 3D) ideal (i.e. the\\nabsence of the dissipative terms) incompressible MHD equations with general\\ninitial data in $\\\\mathbb{T}^3$ (i.e. a spatially periodic domain) tend to a\\nsolution of 2D ideal MHD equations in the distribution sense as $\\\\varepsilon\\\\to\\n0$ by Schochet's fast averaging method in (J. Differential Equations, 114:\\n476--512, 1994). In this paper, we revisit the small Alfv\\\\'en number limit in\\n$\\\\mathbb{R}^n$ with $n=2$, $3$, and develop another approach, motivated by\\nCai--Lei's energy method in (Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 228: 969--993, 2018), to\\nestablish a new conclusion that the \\\\emph{global-in-time} solutions of\\nincompressible MHD equations (including the viscous resistive case) with\\ngeneral initial data converge to zero as $\\\\varepsilon\\\\to 0$ for any given\\ntime-space variable $(x,t)$ with $t>0$. In addition, we find that the large\\nperturbation solutions and vanishing phenomenon of the nonlinear interactions\\nalso exist in the \\\\emph{viscous resistive} MHD equations for small Alfv\\\\'en\\nnumbers, and thus extend Bardos et al.'s results of the \\\\emph{ideal} MHD\\nequations in (Trans Am Math Soc 305: 175--191, 1988).\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T12:10:45Z\"}"}
