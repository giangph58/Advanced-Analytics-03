After establishing a correspondence between state\\ncontrollability in networks of first-order systems with output controllability\\nin networks of higher-order systems, we show that adding higher-order dynamics\\nmay require significantly fewer subsystem modifications to achieve structural\\ncontrollability, when compared to first-order heterogeneous subsystems.\\nFurthermore, we characterize the topology of networks (which we call\\nX-networks) in which the introduction of heterogeneous local dynamics is not\\nnecessary for structural output controllability, as the latter can be attained\\nby suitable higher-order subsystems with homogeneous internal dynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T10:17:15Z\"}"}
