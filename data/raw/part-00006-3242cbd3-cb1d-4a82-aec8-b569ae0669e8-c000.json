{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16551v1\", \"title\": \"A new approach for the unitary Dyson Brownian motion through the theory\\n  of viscosity solutions\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we study the unitary Dyson Brownian motion through a partial\\ndifferential equation approach recently introduced for the real Dyson case. The\\nmain difference with the real Dyson case is that the spectrum is now on the\\ncircle and not on the real line, which leads to particular attention to\\ncomparison principles. First we recall why the system of particles which are\\nthe eigenvalues of unitary Dyson Brownian motion is well posed thanks to a\\ncontainment function. Then we proved that the primitive of the limit spectral\\nmeasure of the unitary Dyson Brownian motion is the unique solution to a\\nviscosity equation obtained by primitive the Dyson equation on the circle.\\nFinally, we study some properties of solutions of Dyson's equation on the\\ncircle. We prove a L $\\\\infty$ regularization. We also look at the long time\\nbehaviour in law of a solution through a study of the so-called free entropy of\\nthe system. We conclude by discussing the uniform convergence towards the\\nuniform measure on the circle of a solution of the Dyson equation.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T09:27:42Z\"}"}
