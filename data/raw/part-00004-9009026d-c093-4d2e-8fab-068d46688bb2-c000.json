{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15232v1\", \"title\": \"Shape-Guided Clothing Warping for Virtual Try-On\", \"summary\": \"Image-based virtual try-on aims to seamlessly fit in-shop clothing to a\\nperson image while maintaining pose consistency. Existing methods commonly\\nemploy the thin plate spline (TPS) transformation or appearance flow to deform\\nin-shop clothing for aligning with the person's body. Despite their promising\\nperformance, these methods often lack precise control over fine details,\\nleading to inconsistencies in shape between clothing and the person's body as\\nwell as distortions in exposed limb regions. To tackle these challenges, we\\npropose a novel shape-guided clothing warping method for virtual try-on, dubbed\\nSCW-VTON, which incorporates global shape constraints and additional limb\\ntextures to enhance the realism and consistency of the warped clothing and\\ntry-on results. To integrate global shape constraints for clothing warping, we\\ndevise a dual-path clothing warping module comprising a shape path and a flow\\npath. The former path captures the clothing shape aligned with the person's\\nbody, while the latter path leverages the mapping between the pre- and\\npost-deformation of the clothing shape to guide the estimation of appearance\\nflow. Furthermore, to alleviate distortions in limb regions of try-on results,\\nwe integrate detailed limb guidance by developing a limb reconstruction network\\nbased on masked image modeling. Through the utilization of SCW-VTON, we are\\nable to generate try-on results with enhanced clothing shape consistency and\\nprecise control over details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority\\nof our approach over state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and\\nquantitatively.
