At the receiver side, we adopt a double sliding-window decoding approach,\\nutilizing a smaller inner decoding window of two block lengths within a larger\\nouter window to enhance the interference cancellation process. Within the inner\\nwindow, the receiver iteratively applies preamble-free joint starting time and\\npattern detection, single-user decoding, and successive interference\\ncancellation operations. A notable feature of the proposed scheme is its\\nelimination of the need for a preamble for starting time detection; this is\\nachieved using ODMA transmission patterns. Numerical results demonstrate that\\nthe proposed asynchronous URA scheme outperforms existing alternatives.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T12:31:24Z\"}"}
