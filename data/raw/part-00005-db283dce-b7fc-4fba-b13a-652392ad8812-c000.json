It has revealed rich connections to recent machine learning methods\\nfor generative modeling and distribution matching. While these methods perform\\nwell in Euclidean domains, they are not directly applicable to topological\\ndomains such as graphs and simplicial complexes, which are crucial for data\\ndefined over network entities, such as node signals and edge flows. In this\\nwork, we propose the Topological Schr\\\\\\\"odinger Bridge problem (TSBP) for\\nmatching signal distributions on a topological domain. We set the reference\\nprocess to follow some linear tractable topology-aware stochastic dynamics such\\nas topological heat diffusion. For the case of Gaussian boundary distributions,\\nwe derive a closed-form topological SB (TSB) in terms of its time-marginal and\\nstochastic differential. In the general case, leveraging the well-known result,\\nwe show that the optimal process follows the forward-backward topological\\ndynamics governed by some unknowns. Building on these results, we develop\\nTSB-based models for matching topological signals by parameterizing the\\nunknowns in the optimal process as (topological) neural networks and learning\\nthem through likelihood training. We validate the theoretical results and\\ndemonstrate the practical applications of TSB-based models on both synthetic\\nand real-world networks, emphasizing the role of topology. Additionally, we\\ndiscuss the connections of TSB-based models to other emerging models, and\\noutline future directions for topological signal matching.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T07:45:21Z\"}"}
