However, the methods used to\\nprove the asymptotic normality of various combinatorial sequences differ\\nsignificantly. In this paper, we present a sufficient condition for\\nestablishing the asymptotic normality of the coefficients of a general\\nP-recursive polynomial sequence. Additionally, we provide two examples that\\nillustrate the application of this sufficient condition.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T08:39:14Z\"}"}
