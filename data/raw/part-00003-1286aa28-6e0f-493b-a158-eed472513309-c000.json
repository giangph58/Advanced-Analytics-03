{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20388v1\", \"title\": \"The two-clock problem in population dynamics\", \"summary\": \"Biological time can be measured in two ways: in generations and in physical\\ntime. When generation intervals differ between individuals, these two clocks\\ndiverge, which impedes our ability to relate mathematical models to real\\npopulations. In this paper we show that nevertheless, these disparate clocks\\nbecome equivalent in the long run via a simple identity relating generational\\nand physical time. This equivalence allows us to directly translate statements\\nfrom mathematical models to the physical world and vice versa. As an\\napplication, we obtain a generalized Euler-Lotka equation linking the basic\\nreproduction number $R_0$ to the growth rate, and derive several\\ninformation-theoretic bounds on these quantities. We also show how the fitness\\nof a lineage can be defined consistently in population models, with\\napplications to microbial growth, epidemiology and population biology.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.PE\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.PE,physics.bio-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T03:15:23Z\"}"}
