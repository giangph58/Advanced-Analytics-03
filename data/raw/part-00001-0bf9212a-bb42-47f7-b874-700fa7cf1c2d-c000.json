{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20534v1\", \"title\": \"A polarized view of the young Pulsar Wind Nebula 3C 58 with IXPE\", \"summary\": \"Pulsar Wind nebulae (PWNe), are among the most efficient particle\\naccelerators in the Universe, however understanding the physical conditions and\\nthe magnetic geometry in their inner region has always proved elusive. X-ray\\npolarization provides now a unique opportunity to investigate the magnetic\\nfield structure and turbulence properties close to where high energy particles\\nare accelerated. Here we report on the recent X-ray polarization measurement of\\nthe PWN 3C 58 by the International X-ray Polarimeter Explorer (IXPE). 3C 58 is\\na young system displaying a characteristic jet-torus structure which, unlike\\nother PWNe, is seen almost edge on. This nebula shows a high level of\\nintegrated polarization ~ 22% at an angle ~ 97deg, with an implied magnetic\\nfield oriented parallel to the major axis of the inner torus, suggesting a\\ntoroidal magnetic geometry with little turbulence in the interior, and an\\nintrinsic level of polarization possibly approaching the theoretical limit for\\nsynchrotron emission. No significant detection of a polarized signal from the\\nassociated pulsar was found. These results confirm that the internal structure\\nof young PWNe is far less turbulent than previously predicted, and at odds with\\nmultidimensional numerical simulations.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T08:27:50Z\"}"}
