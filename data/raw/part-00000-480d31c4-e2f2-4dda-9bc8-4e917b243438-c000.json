{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16694v1\", \"title\": \"Emergent Kagome lattice and non-Abelian lattice gauge field of\\n  biexcitons in t-MoTe$_2$\", \"summary\": \"Non-Abelian gauge fields, characterized by their non-commutative symmetry\\ngroups, shape physical laws from the Standard Model to emergent topological\\nmatter for quantum computation. Here we find that moir\\\\'e exciton dimers\\n(biexcitons) in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ are governed by a genuine non-Abelian\\nlattice gauge field. These dipolar-bound exciton dimers, formed on bonds of the\\nhoneycomb moir\\\\'e superlattice, exhibit three quadrupole configurations\\norganized into a Kagome lattice geometry, on which the valley-flip biexciton\\nhoppings through electron-hole Coulomb exchange act as link variables of the\\nnon-Abelian lattice gauge theory. The emergence of gauge structure here is a\\nnew possibility for composite particles, where the moir\\\\'e electronic structure\\nand interactions between the electron and hole constituents jointly enforce the\\nunderlying geometric constraint. The quadrupole nature of biexciton further\\nmakes possible local gate controls to isolate designated pathways from the\\nextended lattice for exploiting consequences of non-commutative gauge structure\\nincluding the genuine non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm effect. This also provides a\\nnew approach for quantum manipulation of excitonic valley qubit. We show path\\ninterference on a simplest loop can deterministically transform the\\ncomputational basis states into Bell states.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T13:27:11Z\"}"}
