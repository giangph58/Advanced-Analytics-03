Instead, they advocate for the use of the\\nIntraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) as a measure of stability for feature\\nselection. However, the direct effect of segmentation variability on the\\npredictive models is rarely studied. This study investigates the impact of\\nsegmentation variability on feature stability and predictive performance in\\nradiomics-based prediction of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) subtype\\nusing Magnetic Resonance Imaging. A total of 244 images from the Duke dataset\\nwere used, with segmentation variability introduced through modifications of\\nmanual segmentations. For each mask, explainable radiomic features were\\nselected using the Shapley Additive exPlanations method and used to train\\nlogistic regression models. Feature stability across segmentations was assessed\\nvia ICC, Pearson's correlation, and reliability scores quantifying the\\nrelationship between feature stability and segmentation variability. Results\\nindicate that segmentation accuracy does not significantly impact predictive\\nperformance. While incorporating peritumoral information may reduce feature\\nreproducibility, it does not diminish feature predictive capability. Moreover,\\nfeature selection in predictive models is not inherently tied to feature\\nstability with respect to segmentation, suggesting that an overreliance on ICC\\nor reliability scores for feature selection might exclude valuable predictive\\nfeatures.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:48:01Z\"}"}
