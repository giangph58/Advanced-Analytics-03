It\\nis well known that, in the free case, the associated energy functional has a\\nmountain pass geometry on the $L^2$-sphere. This boils down, in higher\\ndimensions, to the existence of a mountain pass solution which is (a suitable\\nscaling of) the Aubin-Talenti function. In this paper, we consider the same\\nproblem, in presence of a weakly attractive, possibly irregular, potential,\\nwondering (i) whether a local minimum solution appears, thus providing an\\norbitally stable family of solitons, and (ii) if the existence of a\\nmountain-pass solution persists. We provide positive answers, depending on\\nsuitable assumptions on the potential and on the mass value.\\n  Moreover, by the Hopf-Cole transform, we give some applications of our\\nresults to the existence of multiple solutions to ergodic Mean Field Games\\nsystems with potential and quadratic Hamiltonian.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:49:21Z\"}"}
