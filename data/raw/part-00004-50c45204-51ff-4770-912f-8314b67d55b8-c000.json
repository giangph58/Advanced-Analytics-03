Preparing high-performance\\nTPCs, especially improving the transparency through microstructure regulation,\\nhas recently caused extensive discussion. However, there is still controversy\\nabout the influence of grains and pores on the transmittance of ceramics, and\\nthere is arbitrariness in the estimation of the theoretical transmittance\\nlimit. In this paper, taking PMN-PT-based ceramics as an example, theoretical\\nmechanisms for the transmittance are discussed. An inhomogeneous reflection\\nmodel is derived to improve the theoretical limit of transmittance. The effects\\nof pores and grains scattering on transmittance are investigated. Rayleigh and\\nRGD approximation are discussed to reveal the underlying scattering mechanisms.\\nIt is found that Rayleigh approximation is suitable for describing pore\\nscattering, while RGD approximation is suitable for grain scattering. Thus, a\\nRayleigh-RGD combined model is proposed to describe light scattering in TPCs\\nand successfully employed to fit experimentally measured transmittance curves.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T12:46:08Z\"}"}
