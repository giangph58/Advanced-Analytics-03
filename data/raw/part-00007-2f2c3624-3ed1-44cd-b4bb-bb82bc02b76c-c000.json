The model fulfils local and global dissipation inequalities\\nso that thermodynamic consistency is guaranteed. Our model consists of a\\nNavier--Stokes--Cahn--Hilliard system for the fluid velocity, pressure, phase\\nfield variable and chemical potential, coupled to an additional system of\\nNavier--Stokes type for the micro-rotation. Our model accounts for non-matched\\ndensities as well as moving contact line dynamics, and serve as a\\ngeneralisation to earlier models for binary fluid flows based on a volume\\naveraged velocity formulation. We also establish the existence of global weak\\nsolutions in three spatial dimensions for the model equipped with singular\\nlogarithmic and double obstacle potentials.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T02:17:19Z\"}"}
