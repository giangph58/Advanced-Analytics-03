{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04418v1\", \"title\": \"Conduction Band Structure and Ultrafast Dynamics of Ferroelectric\\n  $\\u03b1$-GeTe(111)\", \"summary\": \"$\\\\alpha$-GeTe(111) is a non-centrosymmetric ferroelectric (FE) material for\\nwhich a significative lattice distortion combined with a strong spin-orbit\\ninteraction gives rise to giant Rashba split states in the bulk and at the\\nsurface, which have been intensively probed in the occupied valence states\\nusing static angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Nevertheless,\\nits unoccupied conduction band structure remains unexplored, in particular the\\nexperimental determination of its electronic band gap across momentum space.\\nUsing time-resolved ARPES based on high-repetition rate and extreme ultraviolet\\nfemtosecond (fs) laser, we unveil the band structure of $\\\\alpha$-GeTe(111) in\\nthe full Brillouin zone, both in the valence and conduction states, as well as\\nthe exploration of its out-of-equilibrium dynamics. Our work confirms the\\nsemiconducting nature of $\\\\alpha$-GeTe(111) with a 0.85 eV indirect band gap,\\nwhich provides an upper limit for comparison to density functional theory\\ncalculations. We finally reveal the dominant scattering mechanisms of\\nphotoexcited carriers during the out-of-equilibrium dynamics under fs light\\npulses.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T13:52:35Z\"}"}
