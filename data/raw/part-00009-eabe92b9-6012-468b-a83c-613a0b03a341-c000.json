{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11162v1\", \"title\": \"Scalable Transceiver Design for Multi-User Communication in FDD Massive\\n  MIMO Systems via Deep Learning\", \"summary\": \"This paper addresses the joint transceiver design, including pilot\\ntransmission, channel feature extraction and feedback, as well as precoding,\\nfor low-overhead downlink massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)\\ncommunication in frequency-division duplex (FDD) systems. Although deep\\nlearning (DL) has shown great potential in tackling this problem, existing\\nmethods often suffer from poor scalability in practical systems, as the\\nsolution obtained in the training phase merely works for a fixed feedback\\ncapacity and a fixed number of users in the deployment phase. To address this\\nlimitation, we propose a novel DL-based framework comprised of choreographed\\nneural networks, which can utilize one training phase to generate all the\\ntransceiver solutions used in the deployment phase with varying sizes of\\nfeedback codebooks and numbers of users. The proposed framework includes a\\nresidual vector-quantized variational autoencoder (RVQ-VAE) for efficient\\nchannel feedback and an edge graph attention network (EGAT) for robust\\nmultiuser precoding. It can adapt to different feedback capacities by flexibly\\nadjusting the RVQ codebook sizes using the hierarchical codebook structure, and\\nscale with the number of users through a feedback module sharing scheme and the\\ninherent scalability of EGAT. Moreover, a progressive training strategy is\\nproposed to further enhance data transmission performance and generalization\\ncapability. Numerical results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the superior\\nscalability and performance of our approach over existing methods.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP,cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T13:11:26Z\"}"}
