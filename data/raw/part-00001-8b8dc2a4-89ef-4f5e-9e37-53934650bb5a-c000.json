Inspired by a similar concept in engineering, we\\nrefer to our methodology as surrogate anomaly detection. We formalize the\\nconcept of surrogate anomaly detection into a set of axioms required for\\noptimal surrogate models and propose a new algorithm, named DEAN (Deep Ensemble\\nANomaly detection), designed to fulfill these criteria. We evaluate DEAN on 121\\nbenchmark datasets, demonstrating its competitive performance against 19\\nexisting methods, as well as the scalability and reliability of our method.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:15:55Z\"}"}
