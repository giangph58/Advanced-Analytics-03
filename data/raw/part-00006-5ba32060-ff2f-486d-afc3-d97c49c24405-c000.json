The method\\nincorporates dissimilarity representation in multidimensional scaling and\\nsmoothness approach of functional data analysis by using cubic B-spline basis\\nfunctions. The model is designed to arrive at optimal representations with an\\niterative procedure such that dissimilarities evaluated by estimated\\nrepresentations are almost the same as original dissimilarities of objects in a\\nlow dimension which is easier for people to recognize. To solve expensive\\ncomputation in optimization, we propose a computationally efficient method by\\ntaking gradient steps with respect to individual sub-functions of target\\nfunctions using a Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm.
