{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09964v1\", \"title\": \"Characterizing the Palomar 5 Stream: HDBSCAN Analysis and Galactic Halo\\n  Constraints\", \"summary\": \"We utilize the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys DR10 to investigate the previously\\nundetected faint extension of the Palomar 5 stellar stream. By applying the\\nHDBSCAN clustering algorithm, we identify stream members and successfully\\nextend the leading arm of the stream to approximately $\\\\mathrm{DEC} \\\\sim\\n-15^\\\\circ$. Combining the fully detected stream with a suite of mock stream\\nsimulations, we conduct a detailed comparison to constrain both the intrinsic\\nproperties of the stream and the dynamical parameters of the Milky Way (MW)\\nhalo. Our analysis yields a best-fit model characterized by eight parameters:\\n$M_{\\\\mathrm{halo}} = 5.67\\\\times10^{11}\\\\ M_{\\\\odot}$, $r_{s,\\\\mathrm{halo}} =\\n28.94\\\\ \\\\mathrm{kpc}$, $q_z = 0.93$, $M_{\\\\mathrm{gc}} = 4.31\\\\times10^{3}\\\\\\nM_{\\\\odot}$, $dM_{\\\\mathrm{gc}}/dt = 1.81\\\\ M_{\\\\odot}\\\\ \\\\mathrm{Myr}^{-1}$,\\n$\\\\mu_{\\\\alpha}\\\\cos\\\\delta = -2.28\\\\ \\\\mathrm{mas\\\\ yr}^{-1}$, $\\\\mu_{\\\\delta} = -2.26\\\\\\n\\\\mathrm{mas\\\\ yr}^{-1}$, and $D = 23.25\\\\ \\\\mathrm{kpc}$. Notably, our constraints\\non the halo shape indicate that the MW's dark matter halo exhibits a flattened\\npotential, with a minor-to-major axis ratio of $q_z = 0.93$. This finding\\naligns well with theoretical expectations and previous observational estimates.\\nAdditionally, the best-fit model accurately reproduces the observed stream\\nmorphology and dynamics, providing a more precise understanding of both the\\nevolution of the stream and the overall structure of the Galactic halo.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T08:05:19Z\"}"}
