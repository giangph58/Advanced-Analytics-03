In\\nthis paper, we begin to study the shape quantum phase transition in the\\nSU3-IBM. In this new proposed model, spherical-like spectra was found to\\nresolve the spherical nucleus puzzle, which is a new $\\\\gamma$-soft rotational\\nmode. In this paper, the shape phase transition along the new $\\\\gamma$-soft\\nline is first discussed, and then the neighbouring case at the prolate side is\\nalso studied. We find that double shape phase transitions occur along a single\\nparameter path. The new $\\\\gamma$-softness is really a shape phase and the shape\\nphase transition from the new $\\\\gamma$-soft phase to the prolate shape is\\nfound. The experimental support is also found and $^{108}$Pd is the critical\\nnucleus.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T04:15:40Z\"}"}
