{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11076v1\", \"title\": \"Using Time Structure to Estimate Causal Effects\", \"summary\": \"There exist several approaches for estimating causal effects in time series\\nwhen latent confounding is present. Many of these approaches rely on additional\\nauxiliary observed variables or time series such as instruments, negative\\ncontrols or time series that satisfy the front- or backdoor criterion in\\ncertain graphs. In this paper, we present a novel approach for estimating\\ndirect (and via Wright's path rule total) causal effects in a time series setup\\nwhich does not rely on additional auxiliary observed variables or time series.\\nThis approach assumes that the underlying time series is a Structural Vector\\nAutoregressive (SVAR) process and estimates direct causal effects by solving\\ncertain linear equation systems made up of different covariances and model\\nparameters. We state sufficient graphical criteria in terms of the so-called\\nfull time graph under which these linear equations systems are uniquely\\nsolvable and under which their solutions contain the to-be-identified direct\\ncausal effects as components. We also state sufficient lag-based criteria under\\nwhich the previously mentioned graphical conditions are satisfied and, thus,\\nunder which direct causal effects are identifiable. Several numerical\\nexperiments underline the correctness and applicability of our results.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,cs.LG,G.3\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T11:21:37Z\"}"}
