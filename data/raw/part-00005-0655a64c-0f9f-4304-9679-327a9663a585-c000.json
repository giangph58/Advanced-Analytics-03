To overcome\\nthis drawback, we extended the analysis to include hyperbolic and toroidal\\nhorizon topologies within the framework of static, topologically maximally\\nsymmetric spacetimes. We show that both hyperbolic and toroidal black holes can\\nbe constructed without Cauchy horizons and without curvature singularities,\\nthereby avoiding the mass inflation instability. These solutions exhibit\\nasymptotic flatness in a generalized quasi-Minkowskian sense. The\\nphenomenological aspects of these solutions are also studied by examining their\\nthermodynamical properties, the photon sphere, and the effective potentials,\\nensuring consistency with observable properties such as black hole shadows.\\nLastly, we investigate a reconstruction technique within a scalar-tensor\\ngravity framework, illustrating how the discussed metrics can arise from\\nwell-defined scalar field dynamics. Our investigation presents a viable pathway\\nfor constructing physically realistic, regular black holes in both General\\nRelativity and modified gravity, broadening the landscape of singularity-free\\nspacetimes and offering models that may better reflect the nature of strong\\ngravitational fields in astrophysical and cosmological settings.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.CO,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T13:58:30Z\"}"}
