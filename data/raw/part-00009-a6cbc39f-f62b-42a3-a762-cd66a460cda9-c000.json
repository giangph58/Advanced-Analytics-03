{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12765v1\", \"title\": \"Distributed Intelligent Sensing and Communications for 6G: Architecture\\n  and Use Cases\", \"summary\": \"The Distributed Intelligent Sensing and Communication (DISAC) framework\\nredefines Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) for 6G by leveraging\\ndistributed architectures to enhance scalability, adaptability, and resource\\nefficiency. This paper presents key architectural enablers, including advanced\\ndata representation, seamless target handover, support for heterogeneous\\ndevices, and semantic integration. Two use cases illustrate the transformative\\npotential of DISAC: smart factory shop floors and Vulnerable Road User (VRU)\\nprotection at smart intersections. These scenarios demonstrate significant\\nimprovements in precision, safety, and operational efficiency compared to\\ntraditional ISAC systems. The preliminary DISAC architecture incorporates\\nintelligent data processing, distributed coordination, and emerging\\ntechnologies such as Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) to meet 6G's\\nstringent requirements. By addressing critical challenges in sensing accuracy,\\nlatency, and real-time decision-making, DISAC positions itself as a cornerstone\\nfor next-generation wireless networks, advancing innovation in dynamic and\\ncomplex environments.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T09:02:36Z\"}"}
