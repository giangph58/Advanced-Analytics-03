We show lower bounds for the $L^p$-error of such methods in the case\\nof approximation at a single point in time or globally in time. On the one\\nhand, we show that for a large class of piecewise Lipschitz continuous drifts\\nand non-additive diffusions the best possible $L^p$-error rate for final time\\napproximation that can be achieved by any method based on finitely many\\nevaluations of the driving Brownian motion is at most $3/4$, which was\\npreviously known only for additive diffusions. Moreover, we show that the best\\n$L^p$-error rate for global approximation that can be achieved by any method\\nbased on finitely many evaluations of the driving Brownian motion is at most\\n$1/2$ when the drift is locally bounded and the diffusion is locally Lipschitz\\ncontinuous.\\n  For the derivation of the lower bounds we introduce a new method of proof:\\nthe local coupling of noise technique. Using this technique when approximating\\na solution $X$ of the SDE at the final time, a lower bound for the $L^p$-error\\nof any approximation method based on evaluations of the driving Brownian motion\\nat the points $t_1 < \\\\dots < t_n$ can be determined by the $L^p$-distances of\\nsolutions of the same SDE on $[t_{i-1}, t_i]$ with initial values $X_{t_{i-1}}$\\nand driving Brownian motions that are coupled at $t_{i-1}, t_i$ and\\nindependent, conditioned on the values of the Brownian motion at $t_{i-1},\\nt_i$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,cs.NA,math.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T16:59:01Z\"}"}
