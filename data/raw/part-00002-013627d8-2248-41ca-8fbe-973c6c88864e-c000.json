{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07431v1\", \"title\": \"LLM-Enabled Data Transmission in End-to-End Semantic Communication\", \"summary\": \"Emerging services such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR)\\nhave increased the volume of data transmitted in wireless communication\\nsystems, revealing the limitations of traditional Shannon theory. To address\\nthese limitations, semantic communication has been proposed as a solution that\\nprioritizes the meaning of messages over the exact transmission of bits. This\\npaper explores semantic communication for text data transmission in end-to-end\\n(E2E) systems through a novel approach called KG-LLM semantic communication,\\nwhich integrates knowledge graph (KG) extraction and large language model (LLM)\\ncoding. In this method, the transmitter first utilizes a KG to extract key\\nentities and relationships from sentences. The extracted information is then\\nencoded using an LLM to obtain the semantic meaning. On the receiver side,\\nmessages are decoded using another LLM, while a bidirectional encoder\\nrepresentations from transformers (i.e., BERT) model further refines the\\nreconstructed sentences for improved semantic similarity. The KG-LLM semantic\\ncommunication method reduces the transmitted text data volume by 30% through\\nKG-based compression and achieves 84\\\\% semantic similarity between the original\\nand received messages. This demonstrates the KG-LLM methods efficiency and\\nrobustness in semantic communication systems, outperforming the deep\\nlearning-based semantic communication model (DeepSC), which achieves only 63%.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T04:00:11Z\"}"}
