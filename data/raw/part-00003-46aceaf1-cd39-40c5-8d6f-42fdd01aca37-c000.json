{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11008v1\", \"title\": \"MediSee: Reasoning-based Pixel-level Perception in Medical Images\", \"summary\": \"Despite remarkable advancements in pixel-level medical image perception,\\nexisting methods are either limited to specific tasks or heavily rely on\\naccurate bounding boxes or text labels as input prompts. However, the medical\\nknowledge required for input is a huge obstacle for general public, which\\ngreatly reduces the universality of these methods. Compared with these\\ndomain-specialized auxiliary information, general users tend to rely on oral\\nqueries that require logical reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a novel\\nmedical vision task: Medical Reasoning Segmentation and Detection (MedSD),\\nwhich aims to comprehend implicit queries about medical images and generate the\\ncorresponding segmentation mask and bounding box for the target object. To\\naccomplish this task, we first introduce a Multi-perspective, Logic-driven\\nMedical Reasoning Segmentation and Detection (MLMR-SD) dataset, which\\nencompasses a substantial collection of medical entity targets along with their\\ncorresponding reasoning. Furthermore, we propose MediSee, an effective baseline\\nmodel designed for medical reasoning segmentation and detection. The\\nexperimental results indicate that the proposed method can effectively address\\nMedSD with implicit colloquial queries and outperform traditional medical\\nreferring segmentation methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T09:28:53Z\"}"}
