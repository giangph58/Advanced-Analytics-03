{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16420v1\", \"title\": \"A Survey of Foundation Model-Powered Recommender Systems: From\\n  Feature-Based, Generative to Agentic Paradigms\", \"summary\": \"Recommender systems (RS) have become essential in filtering information and\\npersonalizing content for users. RS techniques have traditionally relied on\\nmodeling interactions between users and items as well as the features of\\ncontent using models specific to each task. The emergence of foundation models\\n(FMs), large scale models trained on vast amounts of data such as GPT, LLaMA\\nand CLIP, is reshaping the recommendation paradigm. This survey provides a\\ncomprehensive overview of the Foundation Models for Recommender Systems\\n(FM4RecSys), covering their integration in three paradigms: (1) Feature-Based\\naugmentation of representations, (2) Generative recommendation approaches, and\\n(3) Agentic interactive systems. We first review the data foundations of RS,\\nfrom traditional explicit or implicit feedback to multimodal content sources.\\nWe then introduce FMs and their capabilities for representation learning,\\nnatural language understanding, and multi-modal reasoning in RS contexts. The\\ncore of the survey discusses how FMs enhance RS under different paradigms.\\nAfterward, we examine FM applications in various recommendation tasks. Through\\nan analysis of recent research, we highlight key opportunities that have been\\nrealized as well as challenges encountered. Finally, we outline open research\\ndirections and technical challenges for next-generation FM4RecSys. This survey\\nnot only reviews the state-of-the-art methods but also provides a critical\\nanalysis of the trade-offs among the feature-based, the generative, and the\\nagentic paradigms, outlining key open issues and future research directions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T05:02:51Z\"}"}
