To counter this, we\\npropose an adaptive real-time monitoring mechanism that detects abnormal\\nthermal patterns in chip tiles. Our design space exploration helped identify\\nkey thermal features for an efficient anomaly detection module to be\\nimplemented at routers of network-enabled MPSoCs. To minimize hardware\\noverhead, we employ weighted moving average (WMA) calculations and bit-shift\\noperations, ensuring a lightweight yet effective implementation. By defining a\\nspectrum of abnormal behaviors, our system successfully detects and mitigates\\nmalicious temperature fluctuations, reducing severe cases from 3.00{\\\\deg}C to\\n1.9{\\\\deg}C. The anomaly detection module achieves up to 82% of accuracy in\\ndetecting thermal attacks, which is only 10-15% less than top-performing\\nmachine learning (ML) models like Random Forest. However, our approach reduces\\nhardware usage by up to 75% for logic resources and 100% for specialized\\nresources, making it significantly more efficient than ML-based solutions. This\\nmethod provides a practical, low-cost solution for resource-constrained\\nenvironments, ensuring resilience against thermal attacks while maintaining\\nsystem performance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AR\", \"categories\": \"cs.AR,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T17:36:53Z\"}"}
