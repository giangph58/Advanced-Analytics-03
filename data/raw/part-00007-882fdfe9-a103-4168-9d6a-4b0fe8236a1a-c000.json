{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05059v1\", \"title\": \"Enhancing Reinforcement Learning for the Floorplanning of Analog ICs\\n  with Beam Search\", \"summary\": \"The layout of analog ICs requires making complex trade-offs, while addressing\\ndevice physics and variability of the circuits. This makes full automation with\\nlearning-based solutions hard to achieve. However, reinforcement learning (RL)\\nhas recently reached significant results, particularly in solving the\\nfloorplanning problem. This paper presents a hybrid method that combines RL\\nwith a beam (BS) strategy. The BS algorithm enhances the agent's inference\\nprocess, allowing for the generation of flexible floorplans by accomodating\\nvarious objective weightings, and addressing congestion without without the\\nneed for policy retraining or fine-tuning. Moreover, the RL agent's\\ngeneralization ability stays intact, along with its efficient handling of\\ncircuit features and constraints. Experimental results show approx. 5-85%\\nimprovement in area, dead space and half-perimeter wire length compared to a\\nstandard RL application, along with higher rewards for the agent. Moreover,\\nperformance and efficiency align closely with those of existing\\nstate-of-the-art techniques.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T08:50:32Z\"}"}
