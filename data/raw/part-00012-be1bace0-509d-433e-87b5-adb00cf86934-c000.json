{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20943v1\", \"title\": \"Viability of warm inflation with standard model interactions\", \"summary\": \"The minimal warm inflation scenario proposed in Ref. [1] -- featuring an\\naxion-like inflaton coupled to Standard Model (SM) gluons via the standard\\ninteraction $\\\\phi G \\\\tilde G$ -- offers a compelling bridge between\\ninflationary dynamics and SM particle content. While the model retains only the\\ninflaton as a beyond-SM field, its original analysis relied on some approximate\\ntreatments of warm inflation's (WI) dynamics. Here, we revisit this scenario\\nusing WI2easy, a precision computational tool for WI dynamics [2], to\\nrigorously evaluate the model's viability and full range of model's parameters\\ncompatible with the observational parameters. Overall, we find that the results\\nof Ref. [1] hold, but with significant differences in the weak and strong\\ndissipative regimes of WI.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:10:02Z\"}"}
