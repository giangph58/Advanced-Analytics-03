Relying on this proof, we explicitly demonstrate that\\nfor systems where a normal mode expansion of the Green's function is\\napplicable, the divergence of the equilibrium mean Poynting vector vanishes. As\\nconcrete examples, we also examine the equilibrium mean Poynting vector near a\\nplanar non-reciprocal substrate and in configurations involving an arbitrary\\nnumber of dipolar non-reciprocal objects in free space. Finally, we argue that\\nthe so-called persistent heat current, while present in equilibrium, cannot be\\ndetected through out-of-equilibrium heat transfer measurements.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T11:54:41Z\"}"}
