{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07643v1\", \"title\": \"CollEX -- A Multimodal Agentic RAG System Enabling Interactive\\n  Exploration of Scientific Collections\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we introduce CollEx, an innovative multimodal agentic\\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to enhance interactive\\nexploration of extensive scientific collections. Given the overwhelming volume\\nand inherent complexity of scientific collections, conventional search systems\\noften lack necessary intuitiveness and interactivity, presenting substantial\\nbarriers for learners, educators, and researchers. CollEx addresses these\\nlimitations by employing state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)\\nas multimodal agents accessible through an intuitive chat interface. By\\nabstracting complex interactions via specialized agents equipped with advanced\\ntools, CollEx facilitates curiosity-driven exploration, significantly\\nsimplifying access to diverse scientific collections and records therein. Our\\nsystem integrates textual and visual modalities, supporting educational\\nscenarios that are helpful for teachers, pupils, students, and researchers by\\nfostering independent exploration as well as scientific excitement and\\ncuriosity. Furthermore, CollEx serves the research community by discovering\\ninterdisciplinary connections and complementing visual data. We illustrate the\\neffectiveness of our system through a proof-of-concept application containing\\nover 64,000 unique records across 32 collections from a local scientific\\ncollection from a public university.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR,cs.CL,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T10:44:19Z\"}"}
