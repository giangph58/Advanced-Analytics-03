{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19807v1\", \"title\": \"Multi-Parameter Transitions in Cosmological Calibrators: A Resolution to\\n  the Hubble Tension from SH0ES Data Analysis\", \"summary\": \"The Hubble tension, characterized by discrepant measurements of the Hubble\\nconstant from early and late universe probes, remains one of the most\\nsignificant challenges in cosmology. Building upon our previous analysis of\\nindividual parameter transitions in SH0ES data, we investigate the impact of\\nsimultaneous transitions in multiple Cepheid and SNIa calibration parameters at\\nspecific cosmic distances. We allow various combinations of transitions in\\nCepheid absolute magnitude ($M^W_H$), period-luminosity relation slope ($b_W$),\\nmetallicity coefficient ($Z_W$), and SNIa absolute magnitude ($M_B$). Our\\ncomprehensive analysis reveals a consistent preferred transition distance of\\napproximately 23 Mpc across different parameter combinations. The most\\nstatistically favored model allows simultaneous transitions in $b_W$, $Z_W$,\\nand $M_B$, yielding $\\\\Delta \\\\text{AIC} \\\\simeq -9.2$ and $\\\\Delta \\\\text{BIC}\\n\\\\simeq -3.0$ compared to the baseline SH0ES model. This provides strong\\nevidence for inhomogeneities in standard candle calibrations. We demonstrate\\nthat the post-transition SNIa absolute magnitude aligns more closely with\\nCMB-based constraints, resulting in a reduced Hubble constant value that\\nalleviates the tension. Our findings suggest that the Hubble tension might be\\nresolved through proper modeling of calibration parameter inhomogeneities\\nrather than requiring new physics beyond $\\\\Lambda$CDM.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:04:27Z\"}"}
