We systematically vary heterogeneity levels to assess statistical\\npower, estimator bias and model robustness for each methodology specification.\\nThis assessment focuses on three aspects: performance under joint heterogeneity\\nin location and time, the effectiveness of our proposed settings incorporating\\nlocation fixed effects and study-level fixed effects with a time trend, as well\\nas guidelines for model selection. The results show that jointly modeling\\nheterogeneity when heterogeneity is in both dimensions improves performance\\ncompared to modeling only one type of heterogeneity.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.EM\", \"categories\": \"econ.EM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T13:27:52Z\"}"}
