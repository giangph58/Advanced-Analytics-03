In this paper, we introduce a graph\\nrepresentation of planning problems allying learning efficiency with the\\nability to detect symmetries, along with two pruning methods, action pruning\\nand state pruning, designed to manage symmetries during search. The integration\\nof these techniques into Fast Downward achieves a first-time success over LAMA\\non the latest IPC learning track dataset.
