Nuclear binding energies are computed\\nvia the Hartree-Fock method using a Hamiltonian from delta-full chiral\\neffective field theory. We employ Hartree-Fock emulators to adjust $11$\\nlow-energy constants in the chiral interaction to binding energies of $18$\\neven-even nuclei. When applied to $107$ even-even nuclei with mass numbers\\n$16\\\\leq A\\\\leq 56$ the chiral mass model exhibits an overall root-mean-square\\ndeviation of $3.5$ MeV.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T15:13:19Z\"}"}
