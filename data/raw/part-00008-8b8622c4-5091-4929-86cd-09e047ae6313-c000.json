While previous\\nworks on subgraph similarity search used various graph similarity metrics such\\nas the graph isomorphism, graph edit distance, and so on, in this paper, we\\npropose a novel problem, namely \\\\textit{subgraph similarity search under\\naggregated neighbor difference semantics} (S$^3$AND), which identifies\\nsubgraphs $g$ in a data graph $G$ that are similar to a given query graph $q$\\nby considering both keywords and graph structures (under new keyword/structural\\nmatching semantics). To efficiently tackle the S$^3$AND problem, we design two\\neffective pruning methods, \\\\textit{keyword set} and \\\\textit{aggregated neighbor\\ndifference lower bound pruning}, which rule out false alarms of candidate\\nvertices/subgraphs to reduce the S$^3$AND search space. Furthermore, we\\nconstruct an effective indexing mechanism to facilitate our proposed efficient\\nS$^3$AND query answering algorithm. Through extensive experiments, we\\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our S$^3$AND approach over both\\nreal and synthetic graphs under various parameter settings.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DB\", \"categories\": \"cs.DB,cs.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T08:30:15Z\"}"}
