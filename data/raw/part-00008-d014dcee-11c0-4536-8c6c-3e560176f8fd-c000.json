The performance studies including the detector\\nefficiency, gain, energy resolution and also the stability study under high\\nradiation are most important aspects, to be investigated before using the\\ndetector in any experiment. In this work, all of the above mentioned aspects\\nare investigated using a 55Fe X-ray source for a single mask triple GEM chamber\\nprototype operated with premixed Argon/CO2 (Ar/CO2) gas mixture in 70/30 volume\\nratio. In this article, particularly the stability in efficiency using a\\nradioactive source is discussed in detail.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T09:27:22Z\"}"}
