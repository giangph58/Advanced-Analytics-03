{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11815v1\", \"title\": \"On projection mappings and the gradient projection method on hyperbolic\\n  space forms\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents several new properties of the intrinsic\\n$\\\\kappa$-projection into $\\\\kappa$-hyperbolically convex sets of\\n$\\\\kappa$-hyperbolic space forms, along with closed-form formulas for the\\nintrinsic $\\\\kappa$-projection into specific $\\\\kappa$-hyperbolically convex\\nsets. It also discusses the relationship between the intrinsic\\n$\\\\kappa$-projection, the Euclidean orthogonal projection, and the Lorentz\\nprojection. These properties lay the groundwork for analyzing the gradient\\nprojection method and hold importance in their own right. Additionally, new\\nproperties of the gradient projection method to solve constrained optimization\\nproblems in $\\\\kappa$-hyperbolic space forms are established, considering both\\nconstant and backtracking step sizes in the analysis. It is shown that every\\naccumulation point of the sequence generated by the method for both step sizes\\nis a stationary point for the given problem. Additionally, an iteration\\ncomplexity bound is provided that upper bounds the number of iterations needed\\nto achieve a suitable measure of stationarity for both step sizes. Finally, the\\nproperties of the constrained Fermat-Weber problem are explored, demonstrating\\nthat the sequence generated by the gradient projection method converges to its\\nunique solution. Numerical experiments on solving the Fermat-Weber problem are\\npresented, illustrating the theoretical findings and demonstrating the\\neffectiveness of the proposed methods.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.NA,math.DG,math.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T07:01:00Z\"}"}
