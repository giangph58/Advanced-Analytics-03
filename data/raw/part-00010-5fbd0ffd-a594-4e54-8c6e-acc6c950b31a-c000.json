The\\napproach integrates Dirac-Coulomb relativistic quantum chemistry with the\\nvariational quantum eigensolver (VQE), implemented on a hybrid\\nquantum-classical architecture. Using quantum algorithms based on Jordan-Wigner\\nencoding and relativistic integrals, we simulate ground-state energies and\\npotential energy surfaces for H2, H2O, and H2S molecules. Results demonstrate\\nthat the relativistic VQE correctly reproduces known energy shifts and\\nmolecular trends. Optimizer performance, energy variance, and Pauli term\\ncomplexity are also evaluated. The findings offer insight into scalable quantum\\nsimulations of chemically and physically significant systems involving heavy\\natoms.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T10:15:02Z\"}"}
