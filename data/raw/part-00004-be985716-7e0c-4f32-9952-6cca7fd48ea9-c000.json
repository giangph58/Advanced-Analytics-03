By learning from\\nGA-included states, the proposed approach effectively addresses RIS\\noptimization within a small DRL action space, demonstrating its capability to\\noptimize phase-shift configurations of large-scale RISs.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T13:34:12Z\"}"}
