{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10207v1\", \"title\": \"Generalized Natural Density $\\\\DF(\\\\mathfrak{F}_n)$ of Fibonacci Word\", \"summary\": \"This paper explores profound generalizations of the Fibonacci sequence,\\ndelving into random Fibonacci sequences, $k$-Fibonacci words, and their\\ncombinatorial properties. We established that the $n$-th root of the absolute\\nvalue of terms in a random Fibonacci sequence converges to $1.13198824\\\\ldots$,\\na symmetry identity for sums involving Fibonacci words, $\\\\sum_{n=1}^{b}\\n\\\\frac{(-1)^n F_a}{F_n F_{n+a}} = \\\\sum_{n=1}^{a} \\\\frac{(-1)^n F_b}{F_n\\nF_{n+b}}$, and an infinite series identity linking Fibonacci terms to the\\ngolden ratio. These findings underscore the intricate interplay between number\\ntheory and combinatorics, illuminating the rich structure of Fibonacci-related\\nsequences. We provide, according to this paper, new concepts of density of\\nFibonacci word.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T13:17:38Z\"}"}
