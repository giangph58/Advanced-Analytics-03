{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11157v1\", \"title\": \"Similarity Constrained CC2 for Efficient Coupled Cluster Nonadiabatic\\n  Dynamics\", \"summary\": \"Despite their high accuracy, standard coupled cluster models cannot be used\\nfor nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations because they yield unphysical\\ncomplex excitation energies at conical intersections between same-symmetry\\nexcited states. On the other hand, similarity constrained coupled cluster\\ntheory has enabled the application of coupled cluster theory in such dynamics\\nsimulations. Here, we present a similarity constrained perturbative doubles\\n(SCC2) model with same-symmetry excited-state conical intersections that\\nexhibit correct topography, topology, and real excitation energies. This is\\nachieved while retaining the favorable computational scaling of the standard\\nCC2 model. We illustrate the model for conical intersections in hypofluorous\\nacid and thymine, and compare its performance with other methods. The results\\ndemonstrate that conical intersections between excited states can be described\\ncorrectly and efficiently at the SCC2 level. We therefore expect that the SCC2\\nmodel will enable coupled cluster nonadiabatic dynamics simulations for large\\nmolecular systems.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T13:04:06Z\"}"}
