Challenges and\\n  opportunities of single- and multi-agent systems for multilingual digital\\n  communication\", \"summary\": \"The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced AI agents\\nas a disruptive paradigm across various industries, yet their application in\\nmachine translation (MT) remains underexplored. This paper describes and\\nanalyses the potential of single- and multi-agent systems for MT, reflecting on\\nhow they could enhance multilingual digital communication. While single-agent\\nsystems are well-suited for simpler translation tasks, multi-agent systems,\\nwhich involve multiple specialized AI agents collaborating in a structured\\nmanner, may offer a promising solution for complex scenarios requiring high\\naccuracy, domain-specific knowledge, and contextual awareness. To demonstrate\\nthe feasibility of multi-agent workflows in MT, we are conducting a pilot study\\nin legal MT. The study employs a multi-agent system involving four specialized\\nAI agents for (i) translation, (ii) adequacy review, (iii) fluency review, and\\n(iv) final editing. Our findings suggest that multi-agent systems may have the\\npotential to significantly improve domain-adaptability and contextual\\nawareness, with superior translation quality to traditional MT or single-agent\\nsystems. This paper also sets the stage for future research into multi-agent\\napplications in MT, integration into professional translation workflows, and\\nshares a demo of the system analyzed in the paper.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI,cs.ET,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T12:32:18Z\"}"}
