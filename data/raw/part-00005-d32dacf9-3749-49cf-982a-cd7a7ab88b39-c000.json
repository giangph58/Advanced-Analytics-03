{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15054v1\", \"title\": \"Structure-guided Diffusion Transformer for Low-Light Image Enhancement\", \"summary\": \"While the diffusion transformer (DiT) has become a focal point of interest in\\nrecent years, its application in low-light image enhancement remains a blank\\narea for exploration. Current methods recover the details from low-light images\\nwhile inevitably amplifying the noise in images, resulting in poor visual\\nquality. In this paper, we firstly introduce DiT into the low-light enhancement\\ntask and design a novel Structure-guided Diffusion Transformer based Low-light\\nimage enhancement (SDTL) framework. We compress the feature through wavelet\\ntransform to improve the inference efficiency of the model and capture the\\nmulti-directional frequency band. Then we propose a Structure Enhancement\\nModule (SEM) that uses structural prior to enhance the texture and leverages an\\nadaptive fusion strategy to achieve more accurate enhancement effect. In\\nAddition, we propose a Structure-guided Attention Block (SAB) to pay more\\nattention to texture-riched tokens and avoid interference from noisy areas in\\nnoise prediction. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments\\ndemonstrate that our method achieves SOTA performance on several popular\\ndatasets, validating the effectiveness of SDTL in improving image quality and\\nthe potential of DiT in low-light enhancement tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T12:30:01Z\"}"}
