Our goal is to reconstruct the optical coefficients,\\ni.e., the diffusion and absorption coefficients, using multiple internal\\nobservational data. The foundation of our numerical algorithm lies in solving\\nan inverse diffusivity problem and a direct problem associated with elliptic\\nequations. The stability of the inverse problem depends critically on a\\nnon-zero condition in the internal observations, a condition that can be met\\nusing randomly chosen boundary excitation data. Utilizing these randomly\\ngenerated boundary data, we implement an output least squares formulation\\ncombined with finite element discretization to solve the inverse problem. In\\nthis scenario, we provide a rigorous error estimate in $L^2(\\\\Omega)$ norm for\\nthe numerical reconstruction using a weighted energy estimate, inspired by the\\nanalysis of a newly proposed conditional stability result. The resulting error\\nestimate serves as a valuable guide for selecting appropriate regularization\\nparameters and discretization mesh sizes according to the noise levels present\\nin the data. Several numerical experiments are presented to support our\\ntheoretical results and illustrate the effectiveness of our numerical scheme.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:53:59Z\"}"}
