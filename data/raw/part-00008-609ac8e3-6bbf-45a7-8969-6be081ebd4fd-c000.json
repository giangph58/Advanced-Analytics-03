{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06749v1\", \"title\": \"Evidence of star cluster migration and merger in dwarf galaxies\", \"summary\": \"Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are the densest stellar systems in the Universe.\\nThey can be found at the center of all galaxy types, but tend to favor galaxies\\nof intermediate stellar mass around 10$^9\\\\,$M$_{\\\\odot}$[1, 2]. Currently, two\\nmain processes are under debate to explain their formation: in-situ\\nstar-formation from gas infall[3] and migration and merging of globular\\nclusters (GCs) caused by dynamical friction[4]. Studies[5-9] of NSC stellar\\npopulations suggest that the former predominates in massive galaxies, the\\nlatter prevails in dwarf galaxies, and both contribute equally at intermediate\\nmass. However, up to now, no ongoing merger of GCs has yet been observed to\\nconfirm this scenario. Here we report the serendipitous discovery of five dwarf\\ngalaxies with complex nuclear regions, characterized by multiple nuclei and\\ntidal tails, using high resolution images from the Hubble Space Telescope.\\nThese structures have been reproduced in complementary N-body simulations,\\nsupporting the interpretation that they result from migrating and merging of\\nstar clusters. The small detection rate and short simulated timescales (below\\n100 Myr) of this process may explain why this has not been observed previously.\\nThis study highlights the need of large surveys with high resolution to fully\\nmap the migration scenario steps.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T10:12:37Z\"}"}
