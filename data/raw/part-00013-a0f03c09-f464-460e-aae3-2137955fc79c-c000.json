While existing solutions focus on finding parametric models\\nthat approximate optimal policies, recent approaches find that it is better to\\ngenerate multiple lists to compete for a ``pass'' ticket from an evaluator,\\nwhere the evaluator serves as the supervisor who accurately estimates the\\nperformance of the candidate lists. In this work, we show that we can achieve a\\nmore efficient and effective list proposal with a multi-generator framework and\\nprovide empirical evidence on two public datasets and online A/B tests. More\\nimportantly, we verify that the effectiveness of a generator is closely related\\nto how much it complements the views of other generators with sufficiently\\ndifferent rerankings, which derives the metric of list comprehensiveness. With\\nthis intuition, we design an automatic complementary generator-finding\\nframework that learns a policy that simultaneously aligns the users'\\npreferences and maximizes the list comprehensiveness metric. The experimental\\nresults indicate that the proposed framework can further improve the\\nmulti-generator reranking performance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR,H.3.3\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T06:34:57Z\"}"}
