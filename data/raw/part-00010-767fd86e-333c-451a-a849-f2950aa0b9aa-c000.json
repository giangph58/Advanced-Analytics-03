To be more precise, we study systems of the form \\\\begin{align*}\\n  u_t-\\\\operatorname{div} \\\\left(a(z)|Du|^{p-2}Du+\\nb(z)|Du|^{q-2}Du\\\\right)=-\\\\operatorname{div} \\\\left(a(z)|F|^{p-2}F+\\nb(z)|F|^{q-2}F\\\\right), \\\\end{align*} where $2\\\\leq p\\\\leq q < \\\\infty$ and the\\nmodulating coefficients $a(z)$ and $b(z)$ are non-negative, with $a(z)$ being\\nuniformly continuous and $b(z)$ being H\\\\\\\"{o}lder continuous. We further assume\\nthat the sum of two modulating coefficients is bounded from below by some\\npositive constant. To establish the gradient higher integrability result, we\\nintroduce a suitable intrinsic geometry and develop a delicate comparison\\nscheme to separate and analyze the different phases--namely, the $p$-phase,\\n$q$-phase and $(p,q)$-phase. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\\nregularity result in the parabolic setting that addresses general double phase\\nsystems.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T11:27:55Z\"}"}
