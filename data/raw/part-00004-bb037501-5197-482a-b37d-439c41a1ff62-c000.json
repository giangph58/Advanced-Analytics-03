An RF-SET (radio-frequency single electron\\ntransistor) is predominantly used as its the readout timescale is far shorter\\nthan the spin decoherence time. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a\\ntransmission-based RF-SET using a multi-module semiconductor-superconductor\\nassembly. A monolithically integrated SET placed next to a double quantum dot\\nin a Si/SiGe heterostructure is wire-bonded to a superconducting niobium\\ninductor forming the impedance-transforming network. Compared to RF\\nreflectometry, the proposed set-up is experimentally simpler without the need\\nfor directional couplers. Read-out performance is benchmarked by the\\nsignal-to-noise (SNR) of a dot-reservoir transition (DRT) and an interdot\\ncharge transition (ICT) in the double quantum dot near the SET as a function of\\nRF power and integration time. The minimum integration time for unitary SNR is\\nfound to be 100 ns for ICT and 300 ns for DRT. The obtained minimum integration\\ntimes are comparable to the state of the art in conventional RF reflectometry\\nset-ups. Furthermore, we study the turn-on properties of the RF-SET to\\ninvestigate capacitive shifts and RF losses. Understanding these effects are\\ncrucial for further optimisations of the impedance transforming network as well\\nas the device design to assist RF read-out. This new RF read-out scheme also\\nshows promise for multiplexing spin-qubit readout and further studies on rapid\\ncharge dynamics in quantum dots.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:40:45Z\"}"}
