It is known that the spectral correspondence is a\\nhomeomorphism: close potentials give rise to close spectral data and vice\\nversa. We prove the first explicit two-sided uniform estimate related to this\\ncontinuity in the general $L^2$-case. The proof is based on an exact solution\\nof the inverse spectral problem for Dirac operators with $\\\\delta$-interactions\\non a half-lattice in terms of the Schur's algorithm for analytic functions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.SP\", \"categories\": \"math.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T12:33:18Z\"}"}
