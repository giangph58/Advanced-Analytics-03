The model\\nprovides insights into the pathways of NOx formation and destruction in the\\ndownstream region of a microwave air plasma. The relaxation of the temperatures\\nduring the forced cooling trajectory by the wall is modelled. A Continuous\\nStirred Tank Reactor model and a Plug Flow Reactor model represent the plasma\\nand quenching regions, respectively. For the non-thermal conditions, where gas\\nand vibrational temperatures differ, most reaction rate coefficients, except\\nthose obtained from molecular dynamics methods, are determined based on a\\ngeneralized Fridman-Macheret scheme. The energy transfer channels involved in\\nthe quenching process are tracked across different time scales. By varying the\\ngas temperature in the plasma region and the cooling rate, the reaction\\npathways for the NOx synthesis mechanism are analysed. This research provides a\\nfirst step for the further advancement and optimisation of plasma reactors for\\nefficient NOx production.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:22:19Z\"}"}
