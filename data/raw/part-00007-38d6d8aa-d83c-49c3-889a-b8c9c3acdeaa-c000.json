{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11432v1\", \"title\": \"Analysis of Preheat Propagation in MagLIF-like Plasmas\", \"summary\": \"The preheat and pre-magnetization of the fuel are essential steps in the\\ndesign of Magnetized Liner Inertial Fusion (MagLIF) configurations. Typically,\\nthe energy of the preheat laser is deposited in a central region of the fuel\\nand propagates outward generating magneto-hydrodynamic structures that impact\\nthe fuel mass distribution and magnetic flux compression during the subsequent\\nimplosion. We present a theoretical analysis of preheat propagation in a\\nmagnetized plasma under conditions typical for MagLIF. The analysis is based on\\nthe acoustic time scale for the propagation of pressure disturbances being much\\nshorter than the conductive time scale for heat diffusion. In this regime, the\\npreheat-driven expansion induces the stratification of fuel mass and magnetic\\nfield, which accumulate in a dense outer shelf bounded by the leading shock. We\\nderive self-similar solutions of the mathematical model that describe the\\nhydrodynamic profiles of the expansion, and evaluate the evolution of the\\nmagnetic field in this configuration. The model is supported by FLASH\\nsimulations of preheat propagation. Our analysis shows that the regions where\\nthe magnetization of the fuel is significant tend to become localized\\nasymptotically in time at the interface separating the outer shelf from the\\ninner hot core. We assess the implications of this stratification on the\\nmagnetic flux conservation and performance of fully integrated MagLIF FLASH\\nsimulations.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T17:44:19Z\"}"}
