The main purpose of this work consists in\\ndetermining the critical dynamic exponent $z$ to the three-loop approximation.\\nThis allows us to finalize the quantitative description of the dynamic\\nisotropic percolation class to this order of perturbation theory. The\\ncalculations are performed within the dimensional regularization with the\\nminimal subtraction scheme and actual perturbative expansions are carried out\\nin a formally small parameter $\\\\epsilon$, where $\\\\epsilon = 6 - d$ is a\\ndeviation from the upper critical dimension $d_c = 6$.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T11:28:53Z\"}"}
