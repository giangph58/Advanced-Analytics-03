{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13109v1\", \"title\": \"UniEdit-Flow: Unleashing Inversion and Editing in the Era of Flow Models\", \"summary\": \"Flow matching models have emerged as a strong alternative to diffusion\\nmodels, but existing inversion and editing methods designed for diffusion are\\noften ineffective or inapplicable to them. The straight-line, non-crossing\\ntrajectories of flow models pose challenges for diffusion-based approaches but\\nalso open avenues for novel solutions. In this paper, we introduce a\\npredictor-corrector-based framework for inversion and editing in flow models.\\nFirst, we propose Uni-Inv, an effective inversion method designed for accurate\\nreconstruction. Building on this, we extend the concept of delayed injection to\\nflow models and introduce Uni-Edit, a region-aware, robust image editing\\napproach. Our methodology is tuning-free, model-agnostic, efficient, and\\neffective, enabling diverse edits while ensuring strong preservation of\\nedit-irrelevant regions. Extensive experiments across various generative models\\ndemonstrate the superiority and generalizability of Uni-Inv and Uni-Edit, even\\nunder low-cost settings.
