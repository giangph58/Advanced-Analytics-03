{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19476v1\", \"title\": \"Optimal Sequential Recommendations: Exploiting User and Item Structure\", \"summary\": \"We consider an online model for recommendation systems, with each user being\\nrecommended an item at each time-step and providing 'like' or 'dislike'\\nfeedback. A latent variable model specifies the user preferences: both users\\nand items are clustered into types. The model captures structure in both the\\nitem and user spaces, as used by item-item and user-user collaborative\\nfiltering algorithms. We study the situation in which the type preference\\nmatrix has i.i.d. entries. Our main contribution is an algorithm that\\nsimultaneously uses both item and user structures, proved to be near-optimal\\nvia corresponding information-theoretic lower bounds. In particular, our\\nanalysis highlights the sub-optimality of using only one of item or user\\nstructure (as is done in most collaborative filtering algorithms).\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ML\", \"categories\": \"stat.ML,cs.IT,cs.LG,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T04:34:17Z\"}"}
