In\\nareas with limited physician access, effective auscultation is challenging. We\\npresent a smartphone-based system that leverages built-in microphones and\\nadvanced deep learning algorithms to detect abnormal respiratory sounds\\nindicative of pneumonia risk. Our end-to-end deep learning framework employs\\ndomain generalization to integrate a large electronic stethoscope dataset with\\na smaller smartphone-derived dataset, enabling robust feature learning for\\naccurate respiratory assessments without expensive equipment. The accompanying\\nmobile application guides caregivers in collecting high-quality lung sound\\nsamples and provides immediate feedback on potential pneumonia risks. User\\nstudies show strong classification performance and high acceptance,\\ndemonstrating the system's ability to facilitate proactive interventions and\\nreduce preventable childhood pneumonia deaths. By seamlessly integrating into\\nubiquitous smartphones, this approach offers a promising avenue for more\\nequitable and comprehensive remote pediatric care.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T09:45:50Z\"}"}
