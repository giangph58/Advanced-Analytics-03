Equivalently, there exists a lattice sphere packing in\\n${\\\\mathbb{R}}^n$ whose density is at least $cn^2 \\\\cdot 2^{-n}$. Previously\\nknown constructions of sphere packings in ${\\\\mathbb{R}}^n$ had densities of the\\norder of magnitude of $n \\\\cdot 2^{-n}$, up to logarithmic factors. Our proof\\nutilizes a stochastically evolving ellipsoid that accumulates at least $c n^2$\\nlattice points on its boundary, while containing no lattice points in its\\ninterior except for the origin.\", \"main_category\": \"math.MG\", \"categories\": \"math.MG,math.NT,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:09:05Z\"}"}
