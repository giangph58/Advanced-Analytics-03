Preserving this manifold information is\\nessential to capture the true geometry of EEG signals, but traditional\\nclassification techniques largely overlook this need. To this end, we propose\\nMPEC (Manifold-Preserved EEG Classification via an Ensemble of Clustering-Based\\nClassifiers), that introduces two key innovations: (1) a feature engineering\\nphase that combines covariance matrices and Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels\\nto capture both linear and non-linear relationships among EEG channels, and (2)\\na clustering phase that employs a modified K-means algorithm tailored for the\\nRiemannian manifold space, ensuring local geometric sensitivity. Ensembling\\nmultiple clustering-based classifiers, MPEC achieves superior results,\\nvalidated by significant improvements on the BCI Competition IV dataset 2a.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T08:34:15Z\"}"}
