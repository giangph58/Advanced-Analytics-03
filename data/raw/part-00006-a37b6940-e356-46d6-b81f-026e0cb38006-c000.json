{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12217v1\", \"title\": \"zkVC: Fast Zero-Knowledge Proof for Private and Verifiable Computing\", \"summary\": \"In the context of cloud computing, services are held on cloud servers, where\\nthe clients send their data to the server and obtain the results returned by\\nserver. However, the computation, data and results are prone to tampering due\\nto the vulnerabilities on the server side. Thus, verifying the integrity of\\ncomputation is important in the client-server setting. The cryptographic method\\nknown as Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is renowned for facilitating private and\\nverifiable computing. ZKP allows the client to validate that the results from\\nthe server are computed correctly without violating the privacy of the server's\\nintellectual property. Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of\\nKnowledge (zkSNARKs), in particular, has been widely applied in various\\napplications like blockchain and verifiable machine learning. Despite their\\npopularity, existing zkSNARKs approaches remain highly computationally\\nintensive. For instance, even basic operations like matrix multiplication\\nrequire an extensive number of constraints, resulting in significant overhead.\\nIn addressing this challenge, we introduce \\\\textit{zkVC}, which optimizes the\\nZKP computation for matrix multiplication, enabling rapid proof generation on\\nthe server side and efficient verification on the client side. zkVC integrates\\noptimized ZKP modules, such as Constraint-reduced Polynomial Circuit (CRPC) and\\nPrefix-Sum Query (PSQ), collectively yielding a more than 12-fold increase in\\nproof speed over prior methods.
