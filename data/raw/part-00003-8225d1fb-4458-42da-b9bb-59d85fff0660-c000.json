{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05263v1\", \"title\": \"Ablation of black-Si by (Gauss-)Bessel femtosecond laser beams\", \"summary\": \"Laser machining and modification of black-Si (b-Si) by femtosecond laser\\nGaussian (G-) and Gauss-Bessel (GB-) beams are compared at a wavelength of 1030\\nnm. The GB-beam was generated using a diffractive axicon lens and 10x\\ndemagnification optics. It was found that modification of b-Si well below (a\\nfactor 50x) the single pulse ablation fluence of 0.2 J/cm2 was possible,\\ncorresponding to ablation/melting of nano-needles. The width of modification\\nwas almost independent of pulse energy/fluence and had a width of\\n1/e2-intensity profile at the melting regime. For the GB-beam, the smallest\\nwidth of laser modification at 0.2 J/cm2 threshold (at the center core) was\\nclose to the FWHM of the core of the GB-beam. The aspect ratio of the ablated\\ngroove on the surface of b-Si made by GB-beam was twice as large - up to 8 -\\ncompared to that achievable with G-beam, and it was at a lower fluence of 4\\nJ/cm2 (50x reduction). Reflectivity of two-side nanotextured b-Si on\\nplasma-thinned 70-micrometers thick Si was strongly reduced in the near-IR\\nrange, reaching transmittance >95% at 1.7-2.1 micrometres wavelengths.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:08:26Z\"}"}
