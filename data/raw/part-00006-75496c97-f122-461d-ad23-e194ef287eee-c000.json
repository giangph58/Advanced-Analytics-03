Shear of the mean radial magnetic field\\namplifies the azimuthal component. Radial fields are regenerated by velocity\\nfluctuations that induce shear of radial magnetic fluctuations, followed by\\nLorentz and Coriolis forces that source a negative off-diagonal component in\\nthe turbulent diffusivity tensor. We present a simple schematic to illustrate\\nthis dynamo growth. A different part of the Lorentz force forms a third-order\\ncorrelator in the mean electromotive force that saturates the dynamo.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.SR,physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T16:05:05Z\"}"}
