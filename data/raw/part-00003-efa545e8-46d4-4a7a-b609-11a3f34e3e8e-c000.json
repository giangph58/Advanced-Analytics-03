A\\nconsensus performing CT imaging is to make the radiation dose as low as\\nreasonably achievable, i.e. the ALARA law. In this paper, we propose an\\nend-to-end learning framework, named End2end-ALARA, that jointly optimizes dose\\nmodulation and image reconstruction to meet the goal of ALARA in CT imaging.\\nEnd2end-ALARA works by building a dose modulation module and an image\\nreconstruction module, connecting these modules with a differentiable\\nsimulation function, and optimizing the them with a constrained hinge loss\\nfunction. The objective is to minimize radiation dose subject to a prescribed\\nimage quality (IQ) index. The results show that End2end-ALARA is able to preset\\npersonalized dose levels to gain a stable IQ level across patients, which may\\nfacilitate image-based diagnosis and downstream model training. Moreover,\\ncompared to fixed-dose and conventional dose modulation strategies,\\nEnd2end-ALARA consumes lower dose to reach the same IQ level. Our study sheds\\nlight on a way of realizing the ALARA law in CT imaging.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T10:57:58Z\"}"}
