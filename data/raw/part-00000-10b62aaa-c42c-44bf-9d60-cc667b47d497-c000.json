{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20435v1\", \"title\": \"AI Assisted Cervical Cancer Screening for Cytology Samples in Developing\\n  Countries\", \"summary\": \"Cervical cancer remains a significant health challenge, with high incidence\\nand mortality rates, particularly in transitioning countries. Conventional\\nLiquid-Based Cytology(LBC) is a labor-intensive process, requires expert\\npathologists and is highly prone to errors, highlighting the need for more\\nefficient screening methods. This paper introduces an innovative approach that\\nintegrates low-cost biological microscopes with our simple and efficient AI\\nalgorithms for automated whole-slide analysis. Our system uses a motorized\\nmicroscope to capture cytology images, which are then processed through an AI\\npipeline involving image stitching, cell segmentation, and classification. We\\nutilize the lightweight UNet-based model involving human-in-the-loop approach\\nto train our segmentation model with minimal ROIs. CvT-based classification\\nmodel, trained on the SIPaKMeD dataset, accurately categorizes five cell types.\\nOur framework offers enhanced accuracy and efficiency in cervical cancer\\nscreening compared to various state-of-art methods, as demonstrated by\\ndifferent evaluation metrics.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T05:18:59Z\"}"}
