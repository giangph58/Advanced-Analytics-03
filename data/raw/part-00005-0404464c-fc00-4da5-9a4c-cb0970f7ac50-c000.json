In this\\nexperience report, we focus on energy consumption of executing software, and\\ndescribe teaching approaches from three different universities that all address\\nsoftware energy consumption in various ways. Our main contribution is reporting\\nlessons learned from these experiences and sketching some issues that teachers\\nmust be aware of when designing learning goals, teaching material and\\nexercises.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T12:00:40Z\"}"}
