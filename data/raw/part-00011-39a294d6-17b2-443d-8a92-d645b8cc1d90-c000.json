{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16432v1\", \"title\": \"iTFKAN: Interpretable Time Series Forecasting with Kolmogorov-Arnold\\n  Network\", \"summary\": \"As time evolves, data within specific domains exhibit predictability that\\nmotivates time series forecasting to predict future trends from historical\\ndata. However, current deep forecasting methods can achieve promising\\nperformance but generally lack interpretability, hindering trustworthiness and\\npractical deployment in safety-critical applications such as auto-driving and\\nhealthcare. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretable model, iTFKAN, for\\ncredible time series forecasting. iTFKAN enables further exploration of model\\ndecision rationales and underlying data patterns due to its interpretability\\nachieved through model symbolization. Besides, iTFKAN develops two strategies,\\nprior knowledge injection, and time-frequency synergy learning, to effectively\\nguide model learning under complex intertwined time series data. Extensive\\nexperimental results demonstrated that iTFKAN can achieve promising forecasting\\nperformance while simultaneously possessing high interpretive capabilities.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T05:34:49Z\"}"}
