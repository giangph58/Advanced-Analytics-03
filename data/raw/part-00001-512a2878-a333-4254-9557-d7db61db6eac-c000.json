Recent studies explored\\nwhether LLMs can reliably determine user intent. However, researchers have\\nrecognized the limitations of using generative LLMs for classification tasks.\\nIn this study, we empirically compare user intent classification into\\ninformational, navigational, and transactional categories, using weak\\nsupervision and LLMs. Specifically, we evaluate LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct and\\nLLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct for in-context learning and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct for\\nfine-tuning, comparing their performance to an established baseline classifier\\ntrained using weak supervision (ORCAS-I). Our results indicate that while LLMs\\noutperform weak supervision in recall, they continue to struggle with\\nprecision, which shows the need for improved methods to balance both metrics\\neffectively.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T07:54:04Z\"}"}
