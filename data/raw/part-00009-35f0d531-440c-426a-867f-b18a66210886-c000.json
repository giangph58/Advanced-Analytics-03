As remote operations increasingly rely on digital interfaces,\\nsensors, and networked communication, AI-driven systems transform\\ndecision-making processes across domains such as air traffic control,\\nindustrial automation, and intelligent ports. However, the integration of AI\\nintroduces significant challenges, including the reconfiguration of human-AI\\nteam cognition, the need for adaptive AI memory that aligns with human\\ndistributed cognition, and the design of AI fallback operators to maintain\\ncontinuity during communication disruptions. Drawing on theories of distributed\\nand team cognition, we analyse how cognitive overload, loss of situational\\nawareness, and impaired team coordination may arise in AI-supported\\nenvironments. Based on real-world intelligent port scenarios, we propose\\nresearch directions that aim to safeguard human reasoning and enhance\\ncollaborative decision-making in AI-augmented remote operations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T09:53:49Z\"}"}
