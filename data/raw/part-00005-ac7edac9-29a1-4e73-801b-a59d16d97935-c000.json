{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10039v1\", \"title\": \"Investigating the Role of Bilateral Symmetry for Inpainting Brain MRI\", \"summary\": \"Inpainting has recently emerged as a valuable and interesting technology to\\nemploy in the analysis of medical imaging data, in particular brain MRI. A wide\\nvariety of methodologies for inpainting MRI have been proposed and demonstrated\\non tasks including anomaly detection. In this work we investigate the\\nstatistical relationship between inpainted brain structures and the amount of\\nsubject-specific conditioning information, i.e. the other areas of the image\\nthat are masked. In particular, we analyse the distribution of inpainting\\nresults when masking additional regions of the image, specifically the\\ncontra-lateral structure. This allows us to elucidate where in the brain the\\nmodel is drawing information from, and in particular, what is the importance of\\nhemispherical symmetry? Our experiments interrogate a diffusion inpainting\\nmodel through analysing the inpainting of subcortical brain structures based on\\nintensity and estimated area change. We demonstrate that some structures show a\\nstrong influence of symmetry in the conditioning of the inpainting process.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:41:47Z\"}"}
