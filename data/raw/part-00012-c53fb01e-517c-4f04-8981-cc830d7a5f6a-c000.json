{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12618v1\", \"title\": \"Simultaneous Superoscillations in Space and Time in Nonseparable Light\\n  Pulses\", \"summary\": \"A remarkable phenomenon of superoscillations implies that electromagnetic\\nwaves can locally oscillate in space or time faster than the fastest spatial\\nand temporal Fourier component of the entire function. This phenomenon allows\\nto focus light into an arbitrary small hotspot enabling superresolution imaging\\nand optical metrology with accuracy far beyond the Abbey-Reileigh diffraction\\nlimit. Here we show that, in band-limited supertoroidal light pulses, the\\ntemporal and spatial superoscillations can be observed simultaneously at a\\nspecific region in space and at a specific interval in time.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,physics.class-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T03:47:11Z\"}"}
