{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17752v1\", \"title\": \"Disaggregated Deep Learning via In-Physics Computing at Radio Frequency\", \"summary\": \"Modern edge devices, such as cameras, drones, and Internet-of-Things nodes,\\nrely on deep learning to enable a wide range of intelligent applications,\\nincluding object recognition, environment perception, and autonomous\\nnavigation. However, deploying deep learning models directly on the often\\nresource-constrained edge devices demands significant memory footprints and\\ncomputational power for real-time inference using traditional digital computing\\narchitectures. In this paper, we present WISE, a novel computing architecture\\nfor wireless edge networks designed to overcome energy constraints in deep\\nlearning inference. WISE achieves this goal through two key innovations:\\ndisaggregated model access via wireless broadcasting and in-physics computation\\nof general complex-valued matrix-vector multiplications directly at radio\\nfrequency. Using a software-defined radio platform with wirelessly broadcast\\nmodel weights over the air, we demonstrate that WISE achieves 95.7% image\\nclassification accuracy with ultra-low operation power of 6.0 fJ/MAC per\\nclient, corresponding to a computation efficiency of 165.8 TOPS/W. This\\napproach enables energy-efficient deep learning inference on wirelessly\\nconnected edge devices, achieving more than two orders of magnitude improvement\\nin efficiency compared to traditional digital computing.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.ET,eess.SP,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T17:10:18Z\"}"}
