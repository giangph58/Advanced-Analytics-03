This last result applies to endomorphism rings of finitely generated\\ntorsion-free modules over $h$-local domains. As a consequence, we can give a\\ncomplete characterization of those $h$-local domains of Krull dimension $1$ for\\nwhich every direct summand of a direct sum of copies of a single finitely\\ngenerated torsion-free module is again a direct sum of finitely generated\\nmodules.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AC\", \"categories\": \"math.AC,math.RA,math.RT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T09:46:53Z\"}"}
