There are two dominant hydride\\nclasses where the search is ongoing: the first class is the covalently bonded\\nhydrides (which is represented by H3S), and the second class is the\\nclathrate-type hydrides (which is represented by LaH10, YH6, CaH6). Recently,\\nthe third class of superconducting hydrides, where the hydrogen remains its\\nmolecular form, has been discovered. This class is represented by BaH12 and\\nBiH4. Here, we analyzed experimental data for the BaH12 and BiH4. We found that\\nthe BaH12 exhibits grains of an average size of 26 nm and a low level of\\nmicrostrain 0.1%, in the range of 126 GPa < P < 160 GPa. We also derived the\\nDebye $\\\\Theta_D$ and Einstein $\\\\Theta_E$ temperatures, and the electron-phonon\\ncoupling constant $\\\\Lambda_{e-ph} $ in BaH12 and BiH4. The $\\\\Lambda_{e-ph} $ in\\nBiH4 significantly differs from the values obtained by first-principles\\ncalculations. The derived Fermi temperature $T_F = 20,000 K$ for BiH4 positions\\nthis molecular hydride between the unconventional and conventional\\nsuperconductors bands in the Uemura plot. This position is outside of the band\\nwhere covalently bonded and clathrate hydrides are located. The ratio $\\\\Theta_D\\n/ T_F = 0.026 $ of BiH4 is typical for pure metals and A-15 alloys. This\\nimplies that the BiH4, is the first hydride superconductor which complains with\\nthe Migdal's theorem.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T10:09:45Z\"}"}
