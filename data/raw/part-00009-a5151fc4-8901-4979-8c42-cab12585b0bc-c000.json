{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11161v1\", \"title\": \"Refinements of the Blanco-Koldobsky-Turn\\u0161ek Theorem\", \"summary\": \"We refine the well-known Blanco-Koldobsky-Turn\\\\v{s}ek Theorem which states\\nthat a norm one linear operator defined on a Banach space is an isometry if and\\nonly if it preserves orthogonality at every element of the space. We improve\\nthe result for Banach spaces in which the set of all smooth points forms a\\ndense $G_{\\\\delta}$-set by proving that a norm one linear operator that\\npreserves orthogonality on a dense subset of the space is an isometry. We\\nfurther demonstrate that if such an operator preserves orthogonality on a\\nhyperplane not passing through the origin then it is an isometry. In the\\ncontext of finite-dimensional Banach spaces, we prove that preserving\\northogonality on the set all extreme points of the unit ball forces the\\noperator to be an isometry, which substantially refines\\nBlanco-Koldobsky-Turn\\\\v{s}ek theorem. Finally, for finite-dimensional\\npolyhedral spaces, we establish the significance of the set of all $k$-smooth\\npoints for any possible $k,$ in the study of isometric theory.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T13:10:43Z\"}"}
