{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04583v1\", \"title\": \"Modeling Personalized Difficulty of Rehabilitation Exercises Using\\n  Causal Trees\", \"summary\": \"Rehabilitation robots are often used in game-like interactions for\\nrehabilitation to increase a person's motivation to complete rehabilitation\\nexercises. By adjusting exercise difficulty for a specific user throughout the\\nexercise interaction, robots can maximize both the user's rehabilitation\\noutcomes and the their motivation throughout the exercise. Previous approaches\\nhave assumed exercises have generic difficulty values that apply to all users\\nequally, however, we identified that stroke survivors have varied and unique\\nperceptions of exercise difficulty. For example, some stroke survivors found\\nreaching vertically more difficult than reaching farther but lower while others\\nfound reaching farther more challenging than reaching vertically. In this\\npaper, we formulate a causal tree-based method to calculate exercise difficulty\\nbased on the user's performance. We find that this approach accurately models\\nexercise difficulty and provides a readily interpretable model of why that\\nexercise is difficult for both users and caretakers.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T17:21:45Z\"}"}
