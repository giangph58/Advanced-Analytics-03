Yet if only half the data are used to compute the mean,\\ndividing by $N$ can still yield an unbiased estimator. We show that an\\nalternative mean estimator $\\\\hat{X} = \\\\sum c_n X_n$ can produce such an\\nunbiased variance estimator with denominator $N$. These average-adjusted\\nunbiased variance (AAUV) permit infinitely many unbiased forms, though each has\\nlarger variance than the usual sample variance. Moreover, permuting and\\nsymmetrizing any AAUV recovers the classical formula with denominator $N-1$. We\\nfurther demonstrate a continuum of unbiased variances by interpolating between\\nthe standard and AAUV-based means. Extending this average-adjusting method to\\nhigher-order moments remains a topic for future work.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T04:08:45Z\"}"}
