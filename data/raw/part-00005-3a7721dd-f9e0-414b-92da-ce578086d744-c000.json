{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10289v1\", \"title\": \"Optimal Graph Stretching for Distributed Averaging\", \"summary\": \"The performance of distributed averaging depends heavily on the underlying\\ntopology. In various fields, including compressed sensing, multi-party\\ncomputation, and abstract graph theory, graphs may be expected to be free of\\nshort cycles, i.e. to have high girth. Though extensive analyses and heuristics\\nexist for optimising the performance of distributed averaging in general\\nnetworks, these studies do not consider girth. As such, it is not clear what\\nhappens to convergence time when a graph is stretched to a higher girth.\\n  In this work, we introduce the optimal graph stretching problem, wherein we\\nare interested in finding the set of edges for a particular graph that ensures\\noptimal convergence time under constraint of a minimal girth. We compare\\nvarious methods for choosing which edges to remove, and use various convergence\\nheuristics to speed up the searching process. We generate many graphs with\\nvarying parameters, stretch and optimise them, and measure the duration of\\ndistributed averaging. We find that stretching by itself significantly\\nincreases convergence time. This decrease can be counteracted with a subsequent\\nrepair phase, guided by a convergence time heuristic. Existing heuristics are\\ncapable, but may be suboptimal.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC,cs.DM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T15:01:24Z\"}"}
