{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15193v1\", \"title\": \"Automated Measurement of Eczema Severity with Self-Supervised Learning\", \"summary\": \"Automated diagnosis of eczema using images acquired from digital camera can\\nenable individuals to self-monitor their recovery. The process entails first\\nsegmenting out the eczema region from the image and then measuring the severity\\nof eczema in the segmented region. The state-of-the-art methods for automated\\neczema diagnosis rely on deep neural networks such as convolutional neural\\nnetwork (CNN) and have shown impressive performance in accurately measuring the\\nseverity of eczema. However, these methods require massive volume of annotated\\ndata to train which can be hard to obtain. In this paper, we propose a\\nself-supervised learning framework for automated eczema diagnosis under limited\\ntraining data regime. Our framework consists of two stages: i) Segmentation,\\nwhere we use an in-context learning based algorithm called SegGPT for few-shot\\nsegmentation of eczema region from the image; ii) Feature extraction and\\nclassification, where we extract DINO features from the segmented regions and\\nfeed it to a multi-layered perceptron (MLP) for 4-class classification of\\neczema severity. When evaluated on a dataset of annotated \\\"in-the-wild\\\" eczema\\nimages, we show that our method outperforms (Weighted F1: 0.67 $\\\\pm$ 0.01) the\\nstate-of-the-art deep learning methods such as finetuned Resnet-18 (Weighted\\nF1: 0.44 $\\\\pm$ 0.16) and Vision Transformer (Weighted F1: 0.40 $\\\\pm$ 0.22). Our\\nresults show that self-supervised learning can be a viable solution for\\nautomated skin diagnosis where labeled data is scarce.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T16:02:26Z\"}"}
