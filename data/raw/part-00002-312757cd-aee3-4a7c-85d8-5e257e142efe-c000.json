However, training joint models presents daunting\\narchitectural and optimization challenges. Here, we propose Hyformer, a\\ntransformer-based joint model that successfully blends the generative and\\npredictive functionalities, using an alternating attention mask together with a\\nunified pre-training scheme. We show that Hyformer rivals other joint models,\\nas well as state-of-the-art molecule generation and property prediction models.\\nAdditionally, we show the benefits of joint modeling in downstream tasks of\\nmolecular representation learning, hit identification and antimicrobial peptide\\ndesign.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,q-bio.QM,I.2.1\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T09:36:46Z\"}"}
