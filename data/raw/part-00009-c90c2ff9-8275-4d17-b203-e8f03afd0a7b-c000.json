We consider a fairly general class of\\ndiscounted first-order and convex HJ equations which incorporate an\\nintegro-differential operator posed on the $d$-dimensional torus, and we show\\nthat the solutions converge to a specific critical solution as the discount\\nfactor tends to zero. Our approach relies on duality techniques for nonlocal\\nconvex HJ equations, building upon Hahn-Banach separation theorems to develop a\\ngeneralized notion of Mather measure. The results are applied to a specific\\nclass of convex and superlinear Hamiltonians.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T05:42:24Z\"}"}
