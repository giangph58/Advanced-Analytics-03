In this work, we present\\nnew experimental measurements of the stopping power of tungsten for protons and\\nalpha particles, addressing key gaps in fundamental databases. Our results\\nprovide a densely spaced dataset, refining the practical uncertainty limits to\\napproximately 1.5\\\\% for protons and 4\\\\% for alpha particles. We critically\\ncompare our findings with semi-empirical and theoretical models, evaluating\\ntheir performance in describing the stopping power of tungsten for light\\nprojectiles. By improving the accuracy and reliability of stopping power data,\\nwe contribute to the enhancement of the applicability of ion-beam methods for\\ncharacterizing tungsten in fusion-related research. These findings contribute\\nto the refinement of semi-empirical models and support the ongoing efforts to\\ndevelop more precise theoretical frameworks for ion-solid interactions in\\nhigh-Z materials.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.other\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.other,nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T14:03:50Z\"}"}
