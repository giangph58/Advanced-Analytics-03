{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11251v1\", \"title\": \"Easy repair via codes with simplex locality\", \"summary\": \"In the context of distributed storage systems, locally repairable codes have\\nbecome important. In this paper we focus on codes that allow for multi-erasure\\npattern decoding with low computational effort. Different optimality\\nrequirements, measured by the code's rate, minimum distance, locality,\\navailability as well as field size, influence each other and can not all be\\nmaximized at the same time. We focus on the notion of easy repair, more\\nspecifically on the construction of codes that can repair correctable erasure\\npatterns with minimal computational effort. In particular, we introduce the\\neasy repair property and then present codes of different rates that possess\\nthis property. The presented codes are all in some way related to simplex codes\\nand comprise block codes as well as unit-memory convolutional codes. We also\\nformulate conditions under which the easy repairs can be performed in parallel,\\nthus improving access speed of the distributed storage system.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:47:22Z\"}"}
