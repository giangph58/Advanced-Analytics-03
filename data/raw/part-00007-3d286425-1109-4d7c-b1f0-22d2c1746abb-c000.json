{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11764v1\", \"title\": \"Probing the Abyss of the Quantum Vacuum: A Quest for Fluctuation-Free\\n  Domains\", \"summary\": \"The modification of electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations by boundary\\nconditions is a fundamental prediction of quantum electrodynamics (QED).\\nHowever, direct experimental verification in the optical regime is hindered by\\nthe need for sub-wavelength spatial resolution. Here, we present a novel\\napproach to indirectly probe the spatial distribution of vacuum fluctuations by\\nleveraging radio-frequency (RF) measurements of thermal noise. At RF\\nfrequencies, thermal noise, which occupies the same electromagnetic modes as\\nvacuum fluctuations and is similarly shaped by boundary conditions, dominates\\nthe single-photon energy. By precisely characterizing the spatial distribution\\nof thermal noise near a conducting boundary, we infer the corresponding\\nmodification of vacuum modes and, consequently, the vacuum fluctuations\\nthemselves. Our experimental setup, employing coaxial cables and RF splitters\\nto mimic optical mirrors and beam splitters, enables controlled manipulation of\\nboundary conditions and precise thermal noise measurements. We observe a\\nreduction in thermal noise near the conducting boundary, providing indirect\\nevidence for the theoretically predicted suppression of vacuum fluctuations.\\nThis work establishes a new experimental framework for investigating QED\\neffects in constrained environments, with potential implications for\\nquantum-limited precision measurements, such as gravitational wave detection\\nand intensity-stabilized light sources. This RF approach circumvents the\\nlimitations of optical techniques and opens new avenues for exploring\\nfundamental quantum phenomena.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T04:59:14Z\"}"}
