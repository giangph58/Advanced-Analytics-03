The relevance of this\\noperator is rooted in the fact that it incorporates special and significant\\ncases of interest, like the mixed operator $-\\\\Delta + (-\\\\Delta)^s$, the\\n(possibly) infinite sum of fractional Laplacians and allows to consider\\noperators carrying a \\\"wrong sign\\\".\\n  We first outline weak and strong maximum principles for this type of\\noperators. Then, we complete the spectral analysis for the related Dirichlet\\neigenvalue problem started in [DPLSV25b].\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T07:50:32Z\"}"}
