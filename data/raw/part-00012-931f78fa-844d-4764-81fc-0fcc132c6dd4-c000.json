For any choice of\\n$\\\\lambda$ from the aforementioned residual subset, this cohomological result\\ncan be restated as any of the following two equivalent statements: (1) The\\nfunctional equation $R_{\\\\lambda}[f] = u$ is \\\\emph{uniquely} solvable (modulo\\nthe addition by constant)\\n  for any $u$ satisfying $\\\\int_M u\\\\, d\\\\mu_\\\\lambda =0$, or (2) The Lie algebra\\nof the group of strict contactomorphisms is isomorphic to the span of Reeb\\nvector fields, and so isomorphic to the 1 dimensional abelian Lie algebra\\n$\\\\mathbb R$.\\n  This result is also a key ingredient for the proof of the generic scarcity\\nresult of strict contactomorphisms by Savelyev and the author.\", \"main_category\": \"math.SG\", \"categories\": \"math.SG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T06:41:47Z\"}"}
