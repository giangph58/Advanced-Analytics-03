{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21845v1\", \"title\": \"On the Efficacy of the Peeling Decoder for the Quantum Expander Code\", \"summary\": \"The problem of recovering from qubit erasures has recently gained attention\\nas erasures occur in many physical systems such as photonic systems, trapped\\nions, superconducting qubits and circuit quantum electrodynamics. While several\\nlinear-time decoders for error correction are known, their error-correcting\\ncapability is limited to half the minimum distance of the code, whereas erasure\\ncorrection allows one to go beyond this limit. As in the classical case,\\nstopping sets pose a major challenge in designing efficient erasure decoders\\nfor quantum LDPC codes. In this paper, we show through simulation, that an\\nattractive alternative here, is the use of quantum expander codes in\\nconjunction with the peeling decoder that has linear complexity. We also\\ndiscuss additional techniques including small-set-flip decoding, that can be\\napplied following the peeling operation, to improve decoding performance and\\ntheir associated complexity.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:54:49Z\"}"}
