{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17736v1\", \"title\": \"Design and benchmarking of a two degree of freedom tendon driver unit\\n  for cable-driven wearable technologies\", \"summary\": \"Exosuits have recently been developed as alternatives to rigid exoskeletons\\nand are increasingly adopted for both upper and lower limb therapy and\\nassistance in clinical and home environments. Many cable-driven exosuits have\\nbeen developed but little has been published on their electromechanical designs\\nand performance. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive design and\\nperformance analysis of a two degree of freedom tendon driver unit (TDU) for\\ncable-driven wearable exosuits. Detailed methodologies are presented to\\nbenchmark the functionality of the TDU. A static torque output test compares\\nthe commanded and measured torques. A velocity control test evaluates the\\nattenuation and phase shift across velocities. A noise test evaluates how loud\\nthe TDU is for the wearer under different speeds. A thermal stress test\\ncaptures the cooling performance of the TDU to ensure safe operation at higher\\nloads. Finally, a battery endurance test evaluates the runtime of the TDU under\\nvarious loading conditions to inform the usable time. To demonstrate these\\ntests, a modular TDU system for cable-driven applications is introduced, which\\nallows components such as motors, pulleys, and sensors to be adapted based on\\nthe requirements of the intended application. By sharing detailed methodologies\\nand performance results, this study aims to provide a TDU design that may be\\nleveraged by others and resources for researchers and engineers to better\\ndocument the capabilities of their TDU designs.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T16:49:21Z\"}"}
