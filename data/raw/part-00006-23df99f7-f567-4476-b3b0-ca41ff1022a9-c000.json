The consideration of a\\ncategorical distribution enforces sharper clustering even when data points\\nstrongly overlap in time and frequency, which is the case for most datasets of\\nurban acoustic scenes. To this end, we use a Gumbel-Softmax distribution as a\\nsoft approximation to the categorical distribution, allowing for training via\\nbackpropagation. In this settings, the softmax temperature serves as the main\\nmechanism to tune clustering performance. The results show that the proposed\\nmodel can obtain impressive clustering performance for all considered datasets,\\neven when data points strongly overlap in time and frequency.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.AS\", \"categories\": \"eess.AS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T11:00:17Z\"}"}
