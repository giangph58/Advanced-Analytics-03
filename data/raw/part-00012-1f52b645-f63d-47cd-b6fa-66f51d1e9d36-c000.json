The combined effect of\\nimpact and friction leads to intricate behaviors that require further\\ninvestigation. To address this, the multiple scales method is extended to\\nincorporate frictional effects and is complemented with a generalized impact\\nmap approach. This allows for a systematic exploration of periodic solutions,\\nstability, and bifurcations, revealing critical transitions between\\nimpact-dominated and sliding-dominated regimes. The activation thresholds and\\namplitude levels for different response regimes, including stick-slip dynamics,\\nare identified, offering new insights into friction-induced nonlinearities. The\\nresults bridge the gap between theoretical modeling and practical\\nimplementation, offering a more accurate predictive framework for VINES\\nbehavior. This improves design strategies for enhanced energy dissipation and\\nrobustness in real-world applications.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.CD\", \"categories\": \"nlin.CD\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T13:53:54Z\"}"}
