In this paper,\\nwe present a method and tools to prove non-Koszulness of many properads in a\\nfamily of quadratic properads. We illustrate this method on a family of\\nassociative and coassociative properads with one quadratic compatibility\\nrelation.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AT\", \"categories\": \"math.AT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T07:56:48Z\"}"}
