{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10979v1\", \"title\": \"Deep Learning in Concealed Dense Prediction\", \"summary\": \"Deep learning is developing rapidly and handling common computer vision tasks\\nwell. It is time to pay attention to more complex vision tasks, as model size,\\nknowledge, and reasoning capabilities continue to improve. In this paper, we\\nintroduce and review a family of complex tasks, termed Concealed Dense\\nPrediction (CDP), which has great value in agriculture, industry, etc. CDP's\\nintrinsic trait is that the targets are concealed in their surroundings, thus\\nfully perceiving them requires fine-grained representations, prior knowledge,\\nauxiliary reasoning, etc. The contributions of this review are three-fold: (i)\\nWe introduce the scope, characteristics, and challenges specific to CDP tasks\\nand emphasize their essential differences from generic vision tasks. (ii) We\\ndevelop a taxonomy based on concealment counteracting to summarize deep\\nlearning efforts in CDP through experiments on three tasks. We compare 25\\nstate-of-the-art methods across 12 widely used concealed datasets. (iii) We\\ndiscuss the potential applications of CDP in the large model era and summarize\\n6 potential research directions. We offer perspectives for the future\\ndevelopment of CDP by constructing a large-scale multimodal instruction\\nfine-tuning dataset, CvpINST, and a concealed visual perception agent,\\nCvpAgent.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T08:44:42Z\"}"}
