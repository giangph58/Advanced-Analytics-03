While fine-tuned (M)SLMs enable edge deployment, they often lose general\\ncapabilities and struggle with complex tasks. To address this, we propose\\nEcoAgent, an Edge-Cloud cOllaborative multi-agent framework for mobile\\nautomation. EcoAgent features a closed-loop collaboration among a cloud-based\\nPlanning Agent and two edge-based agents: the Execution Agent for action\\nexecution and the Observation Agent for verifying outcomes. The Observation\\nAgent uses a Pre-Understanding Module to compress screen images into concise\\ntext, reducing token usage. In case of failure, the Planning Agent retrieves\\nscreen history and replans via a Reflection Module. Experiments on AndroidWorld\\nshow that EcoAgent maintains high task success rates while significantly\\nreducing MLLM token consumption, enabling efficient and practical mobile\\nautomation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T17:31:20Z\"}"}
