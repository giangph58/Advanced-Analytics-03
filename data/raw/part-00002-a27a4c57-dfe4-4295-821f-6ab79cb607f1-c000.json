The physical mechanisms of jet\\nlaunching, collimation, and acceleration are poorly understood. Microquasars\\nshow strong variability in multi-wavelength observations. In X-rays, the\\nsources show the fast variation features down to millisecond time scales, with\\nthe prominent quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) around 0.1 Hz - tens of Hz in\\nlight curves, however, physical origin of QPOs is still uncertain. FAST as the\\nlargest radio telescope provides the opportunity to study fast variability of\\nboth radio flux and polarization in microquasars. In the FAST observations from\\n2020 - 2022, we reported the first evidence of radio subsecond quasi-periodic\\noscillations of GRS 1915+105, providing the direct link between QPOs and the\\ndynamics of relativistic jets. These QPOs with the centroid frequency around 5\\nHz are transient, accompanied with strong evolution of the spectral index.\\nCombined with multiwavelength observations, we discuss the possible physical\\nmodels to produce radio QPOs in BH systems: the helical motion of jet knots or\\nprecession of the jet base. In near future, high time resolution radio\\nmonitoring of microquasars based on FAST is expected to discover more new\\nphenomena in black hole systems, which will be important to understand the\\nphysics in strong gravity.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T04:01:25Z\"}"}
