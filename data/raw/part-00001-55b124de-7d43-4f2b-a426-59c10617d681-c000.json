We prove that if $k_n\\\\ll\\nq^{n/2}$, then these matrices have full rank with high probability, and if\\n$k_n\\\\gg q^{n/2}$, then the rank has Gaussian fluctuations.\\n  Second, we consider block lower bidiagonal matrices with $k_n\\\\times k_n$\\nblocks where each block is of size $n\\\\times n$. We prove that if $k_n\\\\ll\\nq^{n/2}$, then the rank exhibits the same constant order fluctuations as the\\nrank of the matrix products considered by Nguyen and Van Peski, and if $k_n\\\\gg\\nq^{n/2}$, then the rank has Gaussian fluctuations.\\n  Finally, we also consider a truncated version of the first model, where we\\nprove that at $k_n\\\\approx q^{n/2}$, we have a phase transition between a\\nCohen-Lenstra and a Gaussian limiting behavior of the rank. We also show that\\nthere is a localization/delocalization phase transition for the vectors in the\\nkernels of these matrices at the same critical point.\\n  In all three cases, we also provide a precise description of the behavior of\\nthe rank at criticality.\\n  These results are proved by analyzing the limiting behavior of a Markov chain\\nobtained from the increments of the ranks of these matrices.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T17:35:02Z\"}"}
