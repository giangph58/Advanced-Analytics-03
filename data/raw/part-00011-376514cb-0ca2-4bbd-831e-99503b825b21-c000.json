Existing approaches\\nto mitigate models' dependence on spurious features work in some cases, but\\nfail in others. In this paper, we systematically analyze how and where neural\\nnetworks encode spurious correlations. We introduce the neuron spurious score,\\nan XAI-based diagnostic measure to quantify a neuron's dependence on spurious\\nfeatures. We analyze both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision\\ntransformers (ViTs) using architecture-specific methods. Our results show that\\nspurious features are partially disentangled, but the degree of disentanglement\\nvaries across model architectures. Furthermore, we find that the assumptions\\nbehind existing mitigation methods are incomplete. Our results lay the\\ngroundwork for the development of novel methods to mitigate spurious\\ncorrelations and make AI models safer to use in practice.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T07:40:45Z\"}"}
