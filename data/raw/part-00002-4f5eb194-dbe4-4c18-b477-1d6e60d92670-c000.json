By investigating the\\nultrafast dynamics of vibronically dressed core excitons in graphite using\\nfemtosecond X-ray pulses from a Free Electron Laser, we reveal previously\\ninaccessible insights into the transient coupling between core excitons and\\nspecific optical phonon modes. Our approach establishes tr-RIXS as a powerful,\\ntransformative tool capable of elucidating the intricate interplay between\\nelectronic and lattice dynamics, opening new avenues in ultrafast materials\\nresearch.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T07:25:38Z\"}"}
