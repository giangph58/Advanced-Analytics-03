This paper\\npresents the study on skew generalized quasi-cyclic (SGQC) codes of length $n$\\nover the non-chain ring $F_q+vF_q$ where $v^2=v$ and $\\\\theta_t$ is the Galois\\nautomorphism. Here, first, we prove the dual of an SGQC code of length $n$ is\\nalso an SGQC code of the same length and derive a necessary and sufficient\\ncondition for the existence of a self-dual SGQC code. Then, we discuss the\\n$1$-generator polynomial and the $\\\\rho$-generator polynomial for skew\\ngeneralized quasi-cyclic codes. Further, we determine the dimension and BCH\\ntype bound for the 1-generator skew generalized quasi-cyclic codes. As a\\nby-product, with the help of MAGMA software, we provide a few examples of SGQC\\ncodes and obtain some $2$-generator SGQC codes of index $2$.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:00:53Z\"}"}
