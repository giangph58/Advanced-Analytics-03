{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20889v1\", \"title\": \"A Decision Diagram Approach for the Parallel Machine Scheduling Problem\\n  with Chance Constraints\", \"summary\": \"The Chance-Constrained Parallel Machine Scheduling Problem (CC-PMSP) assigns\\njobs with uncertain processing times to machines, ensuring that each machine's\\navailability constraints are met with a certain probability. We present a\\ndecomposition approach where the master problem assigns jobs to machines, and\\nthe subproblems schedule the jobs on each machine while verifying the\\nsolution's feasibility under the chance constraint. We propose two different\\nDecision Diagram (DD) formulations to solve the subproblems and generate cuts.\\nThe first formulation employs DDs with a linear cost function, while the second\\nuses a non-linear cost function to reduce the diagram's size. We show how to\\ngenerate no-good and irreducible infeasible subsystem (IIS) cuts based on our\\nDDs. Additionally, we extend the cuts proposed by Lozano & Smith (2018) to\\nsolve two-stage stochastic programming models. Our DD-based methodology\\noutperforms traditional integer programming (IP) models designed to solve the\\nCC-PMSP in several instances. Specifically, our best DD-based approach solves\\n55 more instances than the best IP alternative (from a total of 405) and\\ntypically achieves smaller gaps (50% vs. 120% gap on average).\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T16:07:01Z\"}"}
