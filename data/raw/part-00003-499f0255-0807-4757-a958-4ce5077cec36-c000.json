It is shown that the gap in the linear wave spectrum closes if\\nthese waves are amplitude modulated. To look for solitons as envelopes of\\nexponentially modulated wave packets, the dispersion law of these packets is\\nused. Different decompositions of the dispersion law lead to solutions related\\nto different parts of the spectrum. Numerical calculations demonstrate a good\\nagreement with analytical predictions.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T08:28:41Z\"}"}
