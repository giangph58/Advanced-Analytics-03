{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03409v1\", \"title\": \"Advancing Remote and Continuous Cardiovascular Patient Monitoring\\n  through a Novel and Resource-efficient IoT-Driven Framework\", \"summary\": \"Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of fatalities worldwide, often\\noccurring suddenly with limited time for intervention. Current healthcare\\nmonitoring systems for cardiac patients rely heavily on hospitalization, which\\ncan be impractical for continuous monitoring. This paper presents a novel\\nIoT-based solution for remote, real-time tracking of critical cardiac metrics,\\naddressing the pressing need for accessible and continuous healthcare,\\nparticularly for the aging population in Pakistan. The proposed IoT kit\\nmeasures essential parameters such as body temperature, heart rate (HR), blood\\npressure (BP), oxygen saturation (SPO2), and electrocardiography (ECG).\\n  A key innovation of the system is its integration with a cloud-based\\napplication, enabling constant remote monitoring and incorporating an alarm\\nmechanism to alert medical professionals for timely intervention, reducing the\\nrisk of catastrophic incidents. The system was tested in a clinical environment\\nwith 20 participants, demonstrating results closely aligned with those obtained\\nusing standard medical devices. The findings validate the system's potential\\nfor reliable remote monitoring, offering a significant step forward in\\nproactive cardiac healthcare management. This novel approach combines IoT\\ntechnology with cloud-based applications to provide a cost-effective and\\nefficient solution for reducing unexpected fatalities among cardiac patients.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI,cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T10:35:31Z\"}"}
