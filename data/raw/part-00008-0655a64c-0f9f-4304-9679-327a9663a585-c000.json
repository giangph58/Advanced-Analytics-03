{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04430v1\", \"title\": \"Slow and steady: long-term evolution of the 76-second pulsar\\n  J0901$-$4046\", \"summary\": \"PSR J0901$-$4046, a likely radio-loud neutron star with a period of 75.88\\nseconds, challenges conventional models of neutron star radio emission. Here,\\nwe showcase results from 46 hours of follow-up observations of PSR J0901$-$4046\\nusing the MeerKAT, Murriyang, GMRT, and MWA radio telescopes. We demonstrate\\nthe intriguing stability of the source's timing solution over more than three\\nyears, leading to an RMS arrival-time uncertainty of just $\\\\sim$10$^{-4}$ of\\nthe rotation period. Furthermore, non-detection below 500 MHz may indicate a\\nlow-frequency turnover in the source's spectrum, while no secular decline in\\nthe flux density of the source over time, as was apparent from previous\\nobservations, has been observed. Using high time-resolution MeerKAT data, we\\ndemonstrate two distinct quasi-periodic oscillation modes present in single\\npulses, with characteristic time scales of 73 ms and 21 ms. We also observe a\\nstatistically significant change in the relative prevalence of distinct pulse\\nmorphologies compared to previous observations, possibly indicating a shift in\\nthe magnetospheric composition over time. Finally, we show that the W$_{50}$\\npulse width is nearly constant from 544-4032 MHz, consistent with zero\\nradius-to-frequency mapping. The very short duty cycle ($\\\\sim$1.4$^{\\\\circ}$) is\\nmore similar to radio pulsars with periods $>$5 seconds than to radio-loud\\nmagnetars. This, along with the lack of magnetar-like outbursts or timing\\nglitches, complicates the identification of the source with ultra-long period\\nmagnetar models.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T13:58:38Z\"}"}
