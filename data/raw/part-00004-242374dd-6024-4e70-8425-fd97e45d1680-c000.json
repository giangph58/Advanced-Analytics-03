We review the experimental and\\ntheoretical progress in understanding these quantum-stabilized states, their\\nemergence, and intriguing properties.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas,cond-mat.stat-mech,physics.atom-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T17:10:11Z\"}"}
