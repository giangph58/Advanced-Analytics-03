The interconversion between the two $PT$-symmetric\\ntopological classes is generally difficult due to the constraint of $(PT)^2$.\\nHere, we propose a scheme to control and interconvert the $PT$-symmetric\\ntopological classes by Floquet engineering. We find that it is the breakdown of\\nthe $\\\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge, induced by the $\\\\pi$ phase difference between\\ndifferent hopping rates, by the periodic driving that leads to such an\\ninterconversion. Relaxing the system from the constraint of $(PT)^2$, rich\\nexotic topological phases, e.g., the coexisting $PT$-symmetric first-order real\\nChern insulator and second-order topological insulators not only in different\\nquasienergy gaps, but also in one single gap, are generated. In contrast to\\nconventional Floquet topological phases, our result provides a way to realize\\nexotic topological phases without changing symmetries. It enriches the family\\nof topological phases and gives an insightful guidance for the development of\\nmultifunctional quantum devices.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T03:58:06Z\"}"}
