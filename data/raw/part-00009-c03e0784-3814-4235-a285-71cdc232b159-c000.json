We consider scattering\\ngeodesics in $\\\\mathcal{M}$, first introduced by Victor Guillemin in\\n\\\\cite{Guillemin1976-xr} for hyperbolic surfaces with cusps. These are geodesics\\nin $\\\\mathcal{M}$ that lie in $\\\\mathcal{M} \\\\setminus \\\\Mm$ for both large\\npositive and negative times. Associated with such a scattering geodesic in\\n$\\\\mathcal{M}$, a finite \\\\textit{sojourn time} is defined in\\n\\\\cite{Guillemin1976-xr}. In this article, we study the distribution of these\\nscattering geodesics in $\\\\mathcal{M}$ and their associated \\\\textit{sojourn\\ntimes}. In this process, we establish a connection between the counting of\\nscattering geodesics on the modular surface and the study of positive integers\\nwhose prime divisors lie in arithmetic progression. This article is the first\\nsuch result for scattering geodesics.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT,math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T06:18:13Z\"}"}
