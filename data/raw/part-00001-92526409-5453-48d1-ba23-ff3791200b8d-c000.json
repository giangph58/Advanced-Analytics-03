Starting with a general\\neffective Hamiltonian, we derive amplitude relations among various decay modes\\nwithin the framework of $U$-spin symmetry. These relations lead to\\nsymmetry-based predictions for $CP$-violating rate asymmetries in $U$-spin\\nconjugate decay channels. Furthermore, we demonstrate that all leading-order\\namplitude relations are violated once $U$-spin breaking effects are taken into\\naccount.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T06:01:51Z\"}"}
