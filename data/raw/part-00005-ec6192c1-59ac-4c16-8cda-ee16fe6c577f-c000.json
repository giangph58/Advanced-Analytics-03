{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10154v1\", \"title\": \"The energy content of Alfven waves in the stratified solar atmosphere\", \"summary\": \"Alfven waves propagating in a vertically stratified plasma, such as those\\ntravelling from the solar photosphere to the corona, are partially reflected\\ndue to the gradient in the Alfven speed. Wave reflection naturally results in\\nthe superposition of upward- and downward-propagating waves. A simple analytic\\nmodel demonstrates that this superposition leads to the non-equipartition of\\nkinetic and magnetic energies in the Alfven wave perturbations and slows down\\nthe net energy transport. A numerical model of Alfven wave propagation in the\\nlower solar atmosphere reveals significant wave reflection below the transition\\nregion, leading to highly variable kinetic and magnetic energy content in the\\nlower chromosphere. At higher altitudes, the kinetic energy eventually\\ndominates, depending on the wave frequency. The velocity at which net energy\\npropagates upward is significantly smaller than the local Alfven speed\\nthroughout the chromosphere. Consequently, the commonly used expression for\\nunidirectional Alfven waves in a uniform plasma, which relates the energy flux\\nto the kinetic energy density, is not generally applicable in the stratified\\nlower solar atmosphere and cannot be reliably used to estimate the energy\\ncontent of observed waves. A generalized expression is given, incorporating\\ncorrection factors that account for wave reflection and energy\\nnon-equipartition. The applicability of the expression is discussed.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T12:07:51Z\"}"}
