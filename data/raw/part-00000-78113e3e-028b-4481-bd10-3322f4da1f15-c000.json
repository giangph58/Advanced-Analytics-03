Current theoretical understanding rules out second\\norder ferromagnetic quantum criticality in centrosymmetric 2D and 3D metals.\\nThus, studying the electronic structure of YbNi$_4$P$_2$ is of prime\\nfundamental importance. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we\\nexperimentally prove the existence of 1D Fermi surface contours. In addition,\\nour results demonstrate that part of the electronic structure of YbNi$_4$P$_2$\\nis made of states of higher dimensionality, thereby bringing into question the\\nfact that ferromagnetic quantum criticality in centrosymmetric crystals, is\\nexclusively found in 1D systems. Our experimental data show that the electronic\\nstructure of YbNi$_4$P$_2$ is a playground of mixed dimensionality, electron\\ncorrelations, strong hybridization and spin-orbit coupling, all of them\\nproviding new insights in understanding the origin of ferromagnetic quantum\\ncriticality.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T16:27:42Z\"}"}
