Existing strategies present significant\\nchallenges, among which are the use of multiple subunit types or the precise\\ncontrol of their shape and mechanics. Here we introduce an alternative approach\\nbased on identical subunits whose interactions promote crystals, but also favor\\ncrystalline defects. We theoretically show that topological restrictions on the\\nscope of these defects in large assemblies imply that the assembly size is\\ncontrolled by the magnitude of the defect-inducing interaction. Using DNA\\norigami, we experimentally demonstrate both size and shape control in\\ntwo-dimensional disk- and fiber-like assemblies. Our basic concept of defect\\nengineering could be generalized well beyond these simple examples, and thus\\nprovide a broadly applicable scheme to control self-assembly.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T16:35:44Z\"}"}
