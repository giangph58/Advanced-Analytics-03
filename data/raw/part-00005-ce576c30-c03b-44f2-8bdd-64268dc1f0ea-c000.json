{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20825v1\", \"title\": \"Numerical Relativity Simulations of Dark Matter Admixed Binary Neutron\\n  Stars\", \"summary\": \"Binary neutron star mergers provide insight into strong-field gravity and the\\nproperties of ultra-dense nuclear matter. These events offer the potential to\\nsearch for signatures of physics beyond the standard model, including dark\\nmatter. We present the first numerical-relativity simulations of binary neutron\\nstar mergers admixed with dark matter, based on constraint-solved initial data.\\nModeling dark matter as a non-interacting fermionic gas, we investigate the\\nimpact of varying dark matter fractions and particle masses on the merger\\ndynamics, ejecta mass, post-merger remnant properties, and the emitted\\ngravitational waves. Our simulations suggest that the dark matter morphology -\\na dense core or a diluted halo - may alter the merger outcome. Scenarios with a\\ndark matter core tend to exhibit a higher probability of prompt collapse, while\\nthose with a dark matter halo develop a common envelope, embedding the whole\\nbinary. Furthermore, gravitational wave signals from mergers with dark matter\\nhalo configurations exhibit significant deviations from standard models when\\nthe tidal deformability is calculated in a two-fluid framework. This highlights\\nthe need for refined models in calculating the tidal deformability when\\nconsidering mergers with extended dark matter structures. These initial results\\nprovide a basis for further exploration of dark matter's role in binary neutron\\nstar mergers and their associated gravitational wave emission and can serve as\\na benchmark for future observations from advanced detectors and multi-messenger\\nastrophysics.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:46:04Z\"}"}
