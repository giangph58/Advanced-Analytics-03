Addressing challenges in precision, iterative\\ncoherence, and workflow compatibility, LACE allows flexible control via\\nlayer-based editing and dual-mode collaboration (turn-taking and parallel). A\\npilot study (N=21) demonstrates significant improvements in user satisfaction,\\nownership, usability, and artistic perception compared to standard AI\\nworkflows. We offer comprehensive findings, system details, nuanced user\\nfeedback, and implications for integrating generative AI in professional art\\npractices.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T03:01:27Z\"}"}
