Parameter\\nestimation is an important and challenging task of recovering parameter values\\nfrom observed data. Recently, a method based on differential algebra and\\nrational interpolation was proposed to express parameter estimation in terms of\\npolynomial system solving. Typically, polynomial system solving is a\\nbottleneck, hence the choice of the polynomial solver is crucial. In this\\ncontribution, we compare two polynomial system solvers applied to parameter\\nestimation: homotopy continuation solver from HomotopyContinuation.jl and our\\nnew implementation of a certified solver based on rational univariate\\nrepresentation (RUR) and real root isolation. We show how the new RUR solver\\ncan tackle examples that are out of reach for the homotopy methods and vice\\nversa.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SC\", \"categories\": \"cs.SC,cs.MS,cs.SY,eess.SY,math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T05:53:31Z\"}"}
