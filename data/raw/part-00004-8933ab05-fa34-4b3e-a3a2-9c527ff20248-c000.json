However, a quantum error correcting code which exactly corrects for\\nlocal erasure noise and supports a universal set of transversal gates is ruled\\nout by the Eastin-Knill theorem. Here we provide a new approximate Eastin-Knill\\ntheorem for the single-shot regime when we allow for some probability of error\\nin the decoding. In particular, we show that a quantum error correcting code\\ncan support a universal set of transversal gates and approximately correct for\\nlocal erasure if and only if the conditional min-entropy of the Choi state of\\nthe encoding and noise channel is upper bounded by a simple function of the\\nworst-case error probability. Our no-go theorem can be computed by solving a\\nsemidefinite program, and, in the spirit of the original Eastin-Knill theorem,\\nis formulated in terms of a condition that is both necessary and sufficient,\\nensuring achievability whenever it is passed. As an example, we find that with\\n$n=100$ physical qutrits we can encode $k=1$ logical qubit in the $W$-state\\ncode, which admits a universal transversal set of gates and corrects for single\\nsubsystem erasure with error probability of $\\\\varepsilon = 0.005$. To establish\\nour no-go result, we leverage tools from the resource theory of asymmetry,\\nwhere, in the single-shot regime, a single (output state-dependent) resource\\nmonotone governs all state purifications.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T09:56:26Z\"}"}
