{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11995v1\", \"title\": \"A Review of YOLOv12: Attention-Based Enhancements vs. Previous Versions\", \"summary\": \"The YOLO (You Only Look Once) series has been a leading framework in\\nreal-time object detection, consistently improving the balance between speed\\nand accuracy. However, integrating attention mechanisms into YOLO has been\\nchallenging due to their high computational overhead. YOLOv12 introduces a\\nnovel approach that successfully incorporates attention-based enhancements\\nwhile preserving real-time performance. This paper provides a comprehensive\\nreview of YOLOv12's architectural innovations, including Area Attention for\\ncomputationally efficient self-attention, Residual Efficient Layer Aggregation\\nNetworks for improved feature aggregation, and FlashAttention for optimized\\nmemory access. Additionally, we benchmark YOLOv12 against prior YOLO versions\\nand competing object detectors, analyzing its improvements in accuracy,\\ninference speed, and computational efficiency. Through this analysis, we\\ndemonstrate how YOLOv12 advances real-time object detection by refining the\\nlatency-accuracy trade-off and optimizing computational resources.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T11:40:55Z\"}"}
