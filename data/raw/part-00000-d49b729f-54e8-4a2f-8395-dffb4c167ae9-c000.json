{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13003v1\", \"title\": \"Towards Optimal Distributed Edge Coloring with Small Palettes\", \"summary\": \"We design a deterministic distributed $\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\log n)$-round reduction\\nfrom the $(2\\\\Delta-2)$-edge coloring problem to the much easier\\n$(2\\\\Delta-1)$-edge coloring problem. This is almost optimal, as the\\n$(2\\\\Delta-2)$-edge coloring problem admits an $\\\\Omega(\\\\log_\\\\Delta n)$ lower\\nbound. Further, we also obtain an optimal $\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\log_\\\\Delta n)$-round\\nreduction, albeit to the harder maximal independent set (MIS) problem.\\n  The current state-of-the-art for $(2\\\\Delta - 1)$-edge coloring actually comes\\nfrom an MIS algorithm by [Ghaffari \\\\& Grunau, FOCS'24], which runs in\\n$\\\\widetilde{\\\\mathcal{O}}(\\\\log^{5/3} n)$ rounds. With our new reduction, this\\nround complexity now carries over to the $(2\\\\Delta - 2)$-edge coloring problem\\nas well. Alternatively, one can also plug in the $(\\\\mathrm{poly} \\\\log \\\\Delta +\\n\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\log^{\\\\ast} n))$-round $(2\\\\Delta - 1)$-edge coloring algorithm from\\n[Balliu, Brandt, Kuhn \\\\& Olivetti, PODC'22], which yields an optimal runtime of\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\log n)$ rounds for $\\\\Delta \\\\leq \\\\mathrm{poly} \\\\log n$.\\nPreviously, the fastest deterministic algorithm using less than $2\\\\Delta - 1$\\ncolors for general graphs by [Brandt, Maus, Narayanan, Schager \\\\& Uitto,\\nSODA'25] ran in $\\\\widetilde{\\\\mathcal{O}}(\\\\log^3 n)$ rounds. In addition, we\\nalso obtain a $\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\log \\\\log n)$-round randomized reduction of\\n$(2\\\\Delta - 2)$-edge coloring to $(2\\\\Delta - 1)$-edge coloring. This improves\\nupon the (very recent) best randomized algorithm using less than $2\\\\Delta - 1$\\ncolors from [Bourreau, Brandt \\\\& Nolin, STOC'25] by reducing the round\\ncomplexity from $\\\\widetilde{\\\\mathcal{O}}(\\\\log^{8/3}\\\\log n)$ down to\\n$\\\\widetilde{\\\\mathcal{O}}(\\\\log^{5/3} \\\\log n)$.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS,cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T15:13:20Z\"}"}
