Within the scope of natural assumptions, it has\\nbeen shown that the quantum-gravitational corrections ({\\\\bf qgcs}) to the\\ncharacteristics of such black holes can contribute to all the cosmological\\nparameters, shifting them compared with the semiclassical consideration. These\\ncontributions are determined by a series expansion in terms of a small\\nparameter dependent on the hole mass (radius). For this pattern different cases\\nhave been considered (stationary, black hole evaporation...). It has been\\ndemonstrated that involvement of ({\\\\bf qgcs}) leads to a higher probability for\\nthe occurrence of such {\\\\bf pbhs}. Besides, high-energy deformations of\\nFriedmann Equations created on the basis of these corrections have been derived\\nfor different patterns. In the last section of this work it is introduced a\\nstudy into the contributions generated by the above-mentioned {\\\\bf qgcs} in\\ninflationary cosmological perturbations. Besides, it has been shown that\\nnon-Gaussianity of these perturbations is higher as compared to the\\nsemi-classical pattern.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T14:19:30Z\"}"}
