With the application\\nof pressure, the electrical resistivity Rho(T) and thermopower S(T) of both\\ncrystals were found to increase in the whole temperature range unlike the other\\nknown thermoelectric materials, such as Bi2Te3, SnSe etc. This observation is\\nsupported by the complementary first-principles band structure calculation as\\nthe application of pressure widens the direct bandgap at {\\\\Gamma} point.\\nMoreover, the analysis of the pressure dependent magneto-transport and\\nShubnikov de-Hass oscillation results revealed an increase in carrier\\nconcentration and effective mass along with the reduction of mobility as\\npressure rises. Furthermore, with the application of pressure, the flux-grown\\nZrTe5 crystals display a transition from unipolar to bipolar charge transport\\nas evidenced by the emergence of resistivity peak at T* under high pressure,\\nunlike the CVT-grown ZrTe5 crystals where the bipolar charge transport near its\\ncharacteristic resistivity peak (Tp) remains unaffected.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T13:28:58Z\"}"}
