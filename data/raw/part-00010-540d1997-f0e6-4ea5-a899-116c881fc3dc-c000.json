{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13060v1\", \"title\": \"Imaging for All-Day Wearable Smart Glasses\", \"summary\": \"In recent years smart glasses technology has rapidly advanced, opening up\\nentirely new areas for mobile computing. We expect future smart glasses will\\nneed to be all-day wearable, adopting a small form factor to meet the\\nrequirements of volume, weight, fashionability and social acceptability, which\\nputs significant constraints on the space of possible solutions. Additional\\nchallenges arise due to the fact that smart glasses are worn in arbitrary\\nenvironments while their wearer moves and performs everyday activities. In this\\npaper, we systematically analyze the space of imaging from smart glasses and\\nderive several fundamental limits that govern this imaging domain. We discuss\\nthe impact of these limits on achievable image quality and camera module size\\n-- comparing in particular to related devices such as mobile phones. We then\\npropose a novel distributed imaging approach that allows to minimize the size\\nof the individual camera modules when compared to a standard monolithic camera\\ndesign. Finally, we demonstrate the properties of this novel approach in a\\nseries of experiments using synthetic data as well as images captured with two\\ndifferent prototype implementations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T16:14:34Z\"}"}
