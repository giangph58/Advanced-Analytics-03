By overlaying digital content in real-world\\nenvironments, AR enables new forms of immersive and engaging experiences.\\nHowever, existing AR systems often struggle to effectively manage the many\\ninteractive possibilities that AR presents. This vision paper speculates on\\nAI-driven approaches for adaptive AR content placement, dynamically adjusting\\nto user movement and environmental changes. By leveraging machine learning\\nmethods, such a system would intelligently manage content distribution between\\nAR projections integrated into the external environment and fixed static\\ncontent, enabling seamless UI layout and potentially reducing users' cognitive\\nload. By exploring the possibilities of AI-driven dynamic AR content placement,\\nwe aim to envision new opportunities for innovation and improvement in various\\nindustries, from urban navigation and workplace productivity to immersive\\nlearning and beyond. This paper outlines a vision for the development of more\\nintuitive, engaging, and effective AI-powered AR experiences.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T09:42:38Z\"}"}
