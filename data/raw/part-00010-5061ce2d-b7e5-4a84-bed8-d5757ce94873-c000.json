Our conclusion is based on experimental data for $\\\\pi^0$ production\\nrates at photon-nucleus interactions from the A2 collaboration at the Mainz\\nMAMI accelerator. We assume that $\\\\Delta$ resonance decays are independent of\\nthe production mechanism (via photon, Z, or W boson). In Neutral Current (NC)\\ninteractions, the $1\\\\pi^0 + X$ production scales as A$^{2/3}$, reflecting the\\nnuclear surface area. In contrast, photons from $\\\\Delta$ decays typically\\nescape the nucleus, resulting in a cross-section proportional to the atomic\\nnumber A. Thus, in NC interactions, the ratio of {\\\\gamma} production to $\\\\pi^0$\\nproduction is proportional to A$^{1/3}$. In Charged Current (CC)\\n$\\\\nu_\\\\mu$($\\\\bar \\\\nu_\\\\mu$) -induced production of $\\\\Delta^+$ ($\\\\Delta^0$) will\\nbe proportional to the number of neutrons (protons) in the nucleus. After\\n$\\\\Delta$ decay, due to the charge universality in strong interactions, the\\nsuppression factor for $\\\\pi^0$ escaping the nucleus must also follow\\nA$^{-1/3}$, as in NC interactions.
