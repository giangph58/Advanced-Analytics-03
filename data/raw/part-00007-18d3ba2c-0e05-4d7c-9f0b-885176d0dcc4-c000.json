{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19919v1\", \"title\": \"Distributed Reconstruction from Compressive Measurements: Nonconvexity\\n  and Heterogeneity\", \"summary\": \"The compressive sensing (CS) and 1-bit CS demonstrate superior efficiency in\\nsignal acquisition and resource conservation, while 1-bit CS achieves maximum\\nresource efficiency through sign-only measurements. With the emergence of\\nmassive data, the distributed signal aggregation under CS and 1-bit CS\\nmeasurements introduces many challenges, including nonconvexity and\\nheterogeneity. The nonconvexity originates from the unidentifiability of signal\\nmagnitude under finite-precision measurements. The heterogeneity arises from\\nthe signal and noisy measurement on each node. To address these challenges, we\\npropose a framework with a squared cosine similarity penalty. We address\\nnonconvexity by an novel invex relaxation formulation to ensure the uniqueness\\nof the global optimality. For heterogeneous signals and noisy measurements, the\\nproposed estimate adaptively debiases through correction guided by similarity\\nand signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) information. Our method achieves a high\\nprobability minimax-optimal convergence rate under sufficient node counts and\\nsimilarity conditions, improving from $O\\\\{(p\\\\log{p}/n_j)^{1/2}\\\\}$ to\\n$O\\\\{(p\\\\log{p}/N)^{1/2}+p^{1/2}/n_j\\\\}$, with signal dimension $p$, local and\\ntotal sizes $n_j$ and $N$. Extensive simulations validate the method's\\neffectiveness and performance gains in reconstructing heterogeneous signals\\nfrom 1-bit CS measurements. The proposed framework maintains applicability to\\nCS measurements while reducing communication overhead in distributed setting.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:48:18Z\"}"}
