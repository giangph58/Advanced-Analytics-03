{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11405v1\", \"title\": \"Size-Frequency Distribution of Terrestrial Leftover Planetesimals and\\n  S-complex Implanted Asteroids\", \"summary\": \"The isotopic composition of meteorites linked to S-complex asteroids has been\\nused to suggest that these asteroids originated in the terrestrial planet's\\nregion, i.e., within 1.5 au, and later got implanted into the main asteroid\\nbelt (MAB). Dynamical models of planet formation support this view. Yet, it\\nremains to be demonstrated whether the currently observed size-frequency\\ndistribution (SFD) of S-complex bodies in the MAB can be reproduced via this\\nimplantation process. Here we studied the evolution of the SFD of planetesimals\\nduring the accretion of terrestrial planets with the code LIPAD\\nself-consistently accounting for growth and fragmentation of planetesimals. In\\nour simulations we vary the initial surface density of planetesimals, the\\ngaseous disk lifetime, and the power slope of the initial planetesimals' SFD.\\nWe compared the final SFDs of leftover planetesimals in the terrestrial planet\\nregion with the SFD of observed S-complex MAB objects (D $>$ 100km). We found\\nthat the SFDs of our planetesimal populations and that of S-complex MAB objects\\nshow very similar cumulative power index (i.e., q $\\\\approx$ 3.15 in\\nN($>$D)$~\\\\propto$ D$^{-q}$) for slopes in the diameter range 100 km $<$ D $<$\\n400 km by the end of our simulations. Our results support the hypothesis of\\nS-complex MAB implantation from the terrestrial planet forming region, assuming\\nimplantation is size-independent, and implies that implantation efficiency is\\nsmaller than $\\\\mathcal{O}$(10$^{\\\\rm -2}$--10$^{\\\\rm -4}$) to avoid\\nover-implantation of (4) Vesta-sized objects or larger.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T17:19:57Z\"}"}
