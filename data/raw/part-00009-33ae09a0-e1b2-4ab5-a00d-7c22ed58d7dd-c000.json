{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23909v1\", \"title\": \"Semisuper Efimov effect induced by resonant pair exchange in mixed\\n  dimensions\", \"summary\": \"We introduce a new member to the class of semisuper Efimov effect, where\\ninfinite bound states emerge with their binding energies obeying the universal\\nscaling law of $E_n\\\\sim e^{-2(\\\\pi n/\\\\gamma)^2}$ for sufficiently high\\nexcitation $n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}$. Our system consists of a pair of two-component\\nfermions in three dimensions at infinite scattering length, which furthermore\\ninteract with a boson confined in two dimensions so as to form a three-body\\nbound state at zero energy. When another boson is added, exchange of the\\nresonant pair of fermions between two bosons leads to the semisuper Efimov\\neffect of such four particles with the scaling exponent $\\\\gamma$ determined by\\nthe mass ratio of boson to fermion. If bosons live in three dimensions,\\ninfinite bound states do not emerge but some of them may survive for a large\\nmass ratio, making our findings potentially relevant to two-neutron halo nuclei\\nas well as ultracold atoms.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T10:00:37Z\"}"}
