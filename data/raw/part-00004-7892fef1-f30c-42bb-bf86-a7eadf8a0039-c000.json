{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01422v1\", \"title\": \"Optimization of BLE Broadcast Mode in Offline Finding Network\", \"summary\": \"In the Offline Finding Network(OFN), offline Bluetooth tags broadcast to the\\nsurrounding area, the finder devices receiving the broadcast signal and upload\\nlocation information to the IoT(Internet of Things) cloud servers, thereby\\nachieving offline finding of lost items. This process is essentially a\\nBluetooth low energy (BLE) neighbor discovery process(NDP). In the process, the\\nvariety of Bluetooth scan modes caused by the scan interval and scan window\\nsettings affects the discovery latency of finder devices finding the tag\\nbroadcast packets. To optimize the experience of searching for lost devices, we\\npropose the CPBIS-mechanism, a certain proportion broadcast-intervals screening\\nmechanism that calculates the most suitable two broadcast intervals and their\\nproportion for offline tags. This reduces discovery latency in the BLE NDP,\\nimproves the discovery success rate, further enhances the user experience. To\\nour knowledge, we are the first to propose a comprehensive solution for\\nconfiguring the broadcast interval parameters of advertisers in BLE NDP,\\nparticularly for configurations involving two or more broadcast intervals. We\\nevaluated the results obtained by CPBIS on the nRF52832 chip. The data shows\\nthat the CPBIS-mechanism achieves relatively low discovery latencies for\\nmultiple scan modes.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T07:13:22Z\"}"}
