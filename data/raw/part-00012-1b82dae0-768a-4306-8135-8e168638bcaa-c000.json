These\\nalgorithms achieve parallel efficiency, with polylogarithmic depth and\\npolynomial total work, and are applicable to Ising models in the following\\nregimes: (1) Ferromagnetic Ising models with external fields; (2) Ising models\\nwith interaction matrix $J$ of operator norm $\\\\|J\\\\|_2<1$.\\n  Our parallel Gibbs sampling approaches are based on localization schemes,\\nwhich have proven highly effective in establishing rapid mixing of Gibbs\\nsampling. In this work, we employ two such localization schemes to obtain\\nefficient parallel Ising samplers: the \\\\emph{field dynamics} induced by\\n\\\\emph{negative-field localization}, and \\\\emph{restricted Gaussian dynamics}\\ninduced by \\\\emph{stochastic localization}. This shows that localization schemes\\nare powerful tools, not only for achieving rapid mixing but also for the\\nefficient parallelization of Gibbs sampling.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T12:34:27Z\"}"}
