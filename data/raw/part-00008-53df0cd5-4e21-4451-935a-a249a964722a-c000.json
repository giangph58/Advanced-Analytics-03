To achieve reliable performance\\nunder practical conditions, the use of a synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF)\\nfree-layer configuration was proposed due to its enhanced tolerance to magnetic\\nfield perturbations. For engineering the SAF s-MTJs, we systematically\\ninvestigate the properties of the SAF s-MTJs as a function of the junction\\nsize. We observe that decreasing junction size leads to shorter relaxation\\ntimes, enhanced magnetic field robustness, and enhanced insensitivity to bias\\nvoltage. These findings provide key insights toward high-performance\\np-computers with reliable operation.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.app-ph,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:01:07Z\"}"}
