{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06023v1\", \"title\": \"Infinite Boundary Terms and Pairwise Interactions: A Unified Framework\\n  for Periodic Coulomb Systems\", \"summary\": \"The introduction of the infinite boundary terms and the pairwise interactions\\n[J. Chem. Theory Comput., 10, 5254, (2014)] enables a physically intuitive\\napproach for deriving electrostatic energy and pressure for both neutral and\\nnon-neutral systems under the periodic boundary condition. For a periodic\\nsystem consisting of $N$ point charges (with charge $q_j$ located at ${\\\\mathbf\\nr}_j$ where $j=1,2,\\\\cdots N$) and one charge distribution of density\\n$\\\\rho({\\\\mathbf r})$ within a primary cell of volume $V$, the derived\\nelectrostatic energy can be expressed as, \\\\[ {\\\\mathcal U} = \\\\sum_{i<j}^N\\nq_iq_j\\\\nu({\\\\mathbf r}_{ij} ) + \\\\sum_{j=1}^N q_j \\\\int_V d{\\\\mathbf\\nr}_0\\\\,\\\\rho({\\\\mathbf r}_0) \\\\nu({\\\\mathbf r}_{0j} ) + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\int_V d{\\\\mathbf\\nr}_0 \\\\int_V d{\\\\mathbf r}_1\\\\,\\\\rho({\\\\mathbf r}_0)\\\\rho({\\\\mathbf r}_1) \\\\nu({\\\\mathbf\\nr}_{01}), \\\\] where ${\\\\mathbf r}_{ij}={\\\\mathbf r}_i - {\\\\mathbf r}_j$ is the\\nrelative vector and $\\\\nu({\\\\mathbf r})$ represents the effective pairwise\\ninteraction. The charge density $\\\\rho({\\\\mathbf r})$ is free of\\nDelta-function-like divergence throughout the volume but may exhibit\\ndiscontinuity. This unified formulation directly follows that of the isolated\\nsystem by replacing the Coulomb interaction $1/\\\\lvert {\\\\mathbf r} \\\\rvert$ or\\nother modified Coulomb interactions with $\\\\nu({\\\\mathbf r})$. For a particular\\nsystem of one-component plasma with a uniform neutralizing background, the\\nimplementation of various pairwise formulations clarifies the contribution of\\nthe background and subsequently reveals criteria for arbitrary volume-dependent\\npotentials that preserve the simple relation between energy and pressure.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.comp-ph,physics.chem-ph,physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:27:26Z\"}"}
