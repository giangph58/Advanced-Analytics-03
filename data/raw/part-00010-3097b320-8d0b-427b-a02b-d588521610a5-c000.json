{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19527v1\", \"title\": \"Identification and Estimation of Long-Term Treatment Effects with\\n  Monotone Missing\", \"summary\": \"Estimating long-term treatment effects has a wide range of applications in\\nvarious domains. A key feature in this context is that collecting long-term\\noutcomes typically involves a multi-stage process and is subject to monotone\\nmissing, where individuals missing at an earlier stage remain missing at\\nsubsequent stages. Despite its prevalence, monotone missing has been rarely\\nexplored in previous studies on estimating long-term treatment effects. In this\\npaper, we address this gap by introducing the sequential missingness assumption\\nfor identification. We propose three novel estimation methods, including\\ninverse probability weighting, sequential regression imputation, and sequential\\nmarginal structural model (SeqMSM). Considering that the SeqMSM method may\\nsuffer from high variance due to severe data sparsity caused by monotone\\nmissing, we further propose a novel balancing-enhanced approach, BalanceNet, to\\nimprove the stability and accuracy of the estimation methods. Extensive\\nexperiments on two widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness\\nof our proposed methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T07:07:50Z\"}"}
