{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23729v1\", \"title\": \"Integral regularization PINNs for evolution equations\", \"summary\": \"Evolution equations, including both ordinary differential equations (ODEs)\\nand partial differential equations (PDEs), play a pivotal role in modeling\\ndynamic systems. However, achieving accurate long-time integration for these\\nequations remains a significant challenge. While physics-informed neural\\nnetworks (PINNs) provide a mesh-free framework for solving PDEs, they often\\nsuffer from temporal error accumulation, which limits their effectiveness in\\ncapturing long-time behaviors. To alleviate this issue, we propose integral\\nregularization PINNs (IR-PINNs), a novel approach that enhances temporal\\naccuracy by incorporating an integral-based residual term into the loss\\nfunction. This method divides the entire time interval into smaller\\nsub-intervals and enforces constraints over these sub-intervals, thereby\\nimproving the resolution and correlation of temporal dynamics. Furthermore,\\nIR-PINNs leverage adaptive sampling to dynamically refine the distribution of\\ncollocation points based on the evolving solution, ensuring higher accuracy in\\nregions with sharp gradients or rapid variations. Numerical experiments on\\nbenchmark problems demonstrate that IR-PINNs outperform original PINNs and\\nother state-of-the-art methods in capturing long-time behaviors, offering a\\nrobust and accurate solution for evolution equations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.LG,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T05:02:59Z\"}"}
