{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12642v1\", \"title\": \"Accelerated Collapse Kinetics of Charged Polymers in Good Solvent: Role\\n  of Counterion Condensation\", \"summary\": \"We investigate the collapse kinetics of charged polymers (polyelectrolytes)\\ninduced by counterion condensation using coarse-grained molecular dynamics\\nsimulations. Under good solvent conditions, polyelectrolytes above the critical\\ncharge density ($A > A_c$) exhibit significantly faster collapse dynamics\\ncompared to neutral polymers, with dynamic scaling exponents ($\\\\nu_c \\\\approx\\n0.76-0.84$) distinctly smaller than those observed for neutral polymers ($\\\\nu_c\\n\\\\approx 1.44$) . This accelerated collapse is driven primarily by three\\nmechanisms: (1) local charge neutralization due to counterion condensation,\\nwhich facilitates immediate local compaction, (2) screening of long-range\\nelectrostatic repulsions, reducing the conformational search space, and (3)\\nbridging interactions mediated by multivalent counterions, enhancing efficient\\nformation of intra-chain contacts. We systematically explore the effects of\\npolymer length, charge density, and counterion valency (monovalent, divalent,\\nand trivalent) on collapse dynamics, demonstrating that increased counterion\\nvalency significantly lowers the critical charge density required for collapse\\nand accelerates the collapse process. Our findings highlight the limitations of\\nmodeling charged biopolymers using purely neutral coarse-grained models,\\nunderscoring the importance of electrostatic interactions and counterion\\ndynamics in determining their kinetic pathways. These insights may aid in\\nbetter understanding the folding, organization, and dynamics of inherently\\ncharged biomolecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T05:03:14Z\"}"}
