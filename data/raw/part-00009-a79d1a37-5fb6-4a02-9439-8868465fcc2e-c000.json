{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11169v1\", \"title\": \"MuSeD: A Multimodal Spanish Dataset for Sexism Detection in Social Media\\n  Videos\", \"summary\": \"Sexism is generally defined as prejudice and discrimination based on sex or\\ngender, affecting every sector of society, from social institutions to\\nrelationships and individual behavior. Social media platforms amplify the\\nimpact of sexism by conveying discriminatory content not only through text but\\nalso across multiple modalities, highlighting the critical need for a\\nmultimodal approach to the analysis of sexism online. With the rise of social\\nmedia platforms where users share short videos, sexism is increasingly\\nspreading through video content. Automatically detecting sexism in videos is a\\nchallenging task, as it requires analyzing the combination of verbal, audio,\\nand visual elements to identify sexist content. In this study, (1) we introduce\\nMuSeD, a new Multimodal Spanish dataset for Sexism Detection consisting of\\n$\\\\approx$ 11 hours of videos extracted from TikTok and BitChute; (2) we propose\\nan innovative annotation framework for analyzing the contribution of textual\\nand multimodal labels in the classification of sexist and non-sexist content;\\nand (3) we evaluate a range of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs\\non the task of sexism detection. We find that visual information plays a key\\nrole in labeling sexist content for both humans and models. Models effectively\\ndetect explicit sexism; however, they struggle with implicit cases, such as\\nstereotypes, instances where annotators also show low agreement. This\\nhighlights the inherent difficulty of the task, as identifying implicit sexism\\ndepends on the social and cultural context.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T13:16:46Z\"}"}
