{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04761v1\", \"title\": \"WLPCM Approach for Great Lakes Regulation\", \"summary\": \"This study develops a water-level management model for the Great Lakes using\\na predictive control framework. Requirement 1: Historical data (pre-2019)\\nrevealed consistent monthly water-level patterns. A simulated annealing\\nalgorithm optimized flow control via the Moses-Saunders Dam and Compensating\\nWorks to align levels with multi-year benchmarks. Requirement 2: A Water Level\\nPredictive Control Model (WLPCM) integrated delayed differential equations\\n(DDEs) and model predictive control (MPC) to account for inflow/outflow\\ndynamics and upstream time lags. Natural variables (e.g., precipitation) were\\nmodeled via linear regression, while dam flow rates were optimized over 6-month\\nhorizons with feedback adjustments for robustness. Requirement 3: Testing WLPCM\\non 2017 data successfully mitigated Ottawa River flooding, outperforming\\nhistorical records. Sensitivity analysis via the Sobol method confirmed model\\nresilience to parameter variations. Requirement 4: Ice-clogging was identified\\nas the most impactful natural variable (via RMSE-based sensitivity tests),\\nfollowed by snowpack and precipitation. Requirement 5: Stakeholder demands\\n(e.g., flood prevention, ecological balance) were incorporated into a fitness\\nfunction. Compared to Plan 2014, WLPCM reduced catastrophic high levels in Lake\\nOntario and excessive St. Lawrence River flows by prioritizing long-term\\noptimization. Key innovations include DDE-based predictive regulation,\\nreal-time feedback loops, and adaptive control under extreme conditions. The\\nframework balances hydrological dynamics, stakeholder needs, and uncertainty\\nmanagement, offering a scalable solution for large freshwater systems.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T06:21:22Z\"}"}
