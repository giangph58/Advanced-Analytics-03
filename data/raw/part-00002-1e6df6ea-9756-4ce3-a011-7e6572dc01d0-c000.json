{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12055v1\", \"title\": \"Vibration-assisted tunneling through single Au adatoms on\\n  two-dimensional WSe2\", \"summary\": \"Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) at 5 K was used to study individual Au\\natoms adsorbed on the surface of a WSe2 layer grown on epitaxial graphene. In\\nline with theoretical predictions, scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements\\nreveal that the weakly bound adatom gives rise to an electronic state within\\nthe energy band gap of the WSe2 layer. Adatoms in different surface locations\\nshow different gap-state energy values that follow a random distribution around\\nthe Fermi level of the sample with a standard deviation of ~50 meV. The\\nlocation-dependent shift is attributed to spatial variations in disorder\\npotential. Tunneling via the gap state is accompanied by vibrational\\nexcitations as apparent from pronounced sideband peaks in the conductance\\nspectra with Poisson-distributed intensities indicating significant\\nelectron-phonon coupling with a Huang-Rhys factor of S=2.8. STM tunneling\\nthrough single Au adatoms on two-dimensional WSe2 constitutes a model case of\\nresonant double-barrier tunneling accompanied by strong coupling to vibrational\\ndegrees of freedom.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T13:09:24Z\"}"}
