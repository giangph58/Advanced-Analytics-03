{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21813v1\", \"title\": \"Turning a negative neutrino mass into a positive optical depth\", \"summary\": \"Under $\\\\Lambda$CDM, recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) distance\\nmeasures from DESI, which favor a low matter density $\\\\Omega_m$, are in\\nmoderate $2-3\\\\sigma$ tension with cosmic microwave background (CMB)\\nobservations. This tension appears alternately as a preference for the sum of\\nneutrino masses dropping below the $\\\\sum m_\\\\nu = 0.06$eV value required by\\nneutrino oscillation measurements to formally negative values; a discrepant\\nvalue of $\\\\Omega_m$ at 0.06eV; or preference for dynamical dark energy beyond\\n$\\\\Lambda$CDM. We show that this tension largely arises from the CMB lensing\\nconstraints on the calibration of the sound horizon for geometric measurements\\nand relies on the measurement of the reionization optical depth $\\\\tau$ from\\nlarge-angle CMB polarization to set the lensing amplitude. Dropping these\\nconstraints removes the neutrino tension at $\\\\sum m_\\\\nu=0.06$eV entirely,\\nfavoring $\\\\tau = 0.091\\\\pm 0.011$ in $\\\\Lambda$CDM. Beyond $\\\\Lambda$CDM, it\\nbrings the preference for $w_0-w_a$ dynamical dark energy to below $95\\\\%$ CL.\\nWe explore the freedom in interpreting the low-$\\\\ell$ EE polarization\\nconstraint due to analysis choices and reionization modeling beyond the\\nstandard step-function assumption and find that this drops the neutrino tension\\nin $\\\\Lambda$CDM to below $95\\\\%$ CL. Alternately, this raising of $\\\\tau$ can\\nalso be achieved by the same reduction in large-scale curvature fluctuations\\nthat also ameliorates the low-$\\\\ell$ temperature anomaly.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:16:54Z\"}"}
