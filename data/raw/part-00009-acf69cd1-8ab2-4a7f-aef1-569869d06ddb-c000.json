{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04369v1\", \"title\": \"WDMamba: When Wavelet Degradation Prior Meets Vision Mamba for Image\\n  Dehazing\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we reveal a novel haze-specific wavelet degradation prior\\nobserved through wavelet transform analysis, which shows that haze-related\\ninformation predominantly resides in low-frequency components. Exploiting this\\ninsight, we propose a novel dehazing framework, WDMamba, which decomposes the\\nimage dehazing task into two sequential stages: low-frequency restoration\\nfollowed by detail enhancement. This coarse-to-fine strategy enables WDMamba to\\neffectively capture features specific to each stage of the dehazing process,\\nresulting in high-quality restored images. Specifically, in the low-frequency\\nrestoration stage, we integrate Mamba blocks to reconstruct global structures\\nwith linear complexity, efficiently removing overall haze and producing a\\ncoarse restored image. Thereafter, the detail enhancement stage reinstates\\nfine-grained information that may have been overlooked during the previous\\nphase, culminating in the final dehazed output. Furthermore, to enhance detail\\nretention and achieve more natural dehazing, we introduce a self-guided\\ncontrastive regularization during network training. By utilizing the coarse\\nrestored output as a hard negative example, our model learns more\\ndiscriminative representations, substantially boosting the overall dehazing\\nperformance. Extensive evaluations on public dehazing benchmarks demonstrate\\nthat our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches both qualitatively and\\nquantitatively.
