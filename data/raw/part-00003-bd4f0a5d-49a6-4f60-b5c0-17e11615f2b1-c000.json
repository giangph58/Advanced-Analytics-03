We\\nadvocate defining these seeds through Influence Propagation Paths (IPPs), which\\nis essential for scaling up the network. Our focus lies in efficiently labeling\\nIPPs and accurately predicting these seeds, while addressing the\\noften-overlooked cold-start issue prevalent in temporal networks. Our strategy\\nintroduces a motif-based labeling method and a tensorized Temporal Graph\\nNetwork (TGN) tailored for multi-relational temporal graphs, bolstering\\nprediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Moreover, we augment\\ncold-start nodes with new neighbors from historical data sharing similar IPPs.\\nThe recommendation system within an online team-based gaming environment\\npresents subtle impact on the social network, forming multi-relational (i.e.,\\nweak and strong) temporal graphs for our empirical IM study. We conduct offline\\nexperiments to assess prediction accuracy and model training efficiency,\\ncomplemented by online A/B testing to validate practical network growth and the\\neffectiveness in addressing the cold-start issue.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SI\", \"categories\": \"cs.SI,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:44:30Z\"}"}
