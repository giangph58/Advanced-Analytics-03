By incorporating an\\nenergy-independent phenomenological shell factor as a single input feature, the\\nPE-BNN captures both fine structures and global energy trends. The combination\\nof this physics-informed input with hyperparameter optimization via the\\nWatanabe-Akaike Information Criterion (WAIC) significantly enhances predictive\\nperformance. Our results demonstrate that the PE-BNN framework is well-suited\\nfor target observables with systematic features that can be embedded as model\\ninputs, achieving close agreement with known shell effects and prompt neutron\\nmultiplicities.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,nucl-ex,physics.data-an\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T06:04:04Z\"}"}
