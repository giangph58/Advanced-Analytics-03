{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15554v1\", \"title\": \"Partition laser assembling technique\", \"summary\": \"The advancement of micro/nanofabrication techniques with high throughput,\\nefficiency, and flexibility is critical for fields like integrated photonics,\\nbiosensing, and medical diagnostics. This study presents Partition Laser\\nAssembling (PLA), a novel laser technique for fabricating complex\\nmicro/nanostructures akin to puzzle pieces. By dividing the target patterns\\ndescribed by scalable vector graphics into partitions, any structures in each\\npartition can be fabricated via structured lights as \\\"light stamp\\\" through\\nspatial light modulation. Unlike traditional direct laser writing, PLA\\neliminates reliance on mechanical components, avoiding step-like artifacts and\\nensuring smoother fabrication of complex micro/nanostructures. By seamlessly\\nassembling basic shapes, PLA achieves intricate structures like micro artworks\\nand metalenses with unmatched precision and resolution. Leveraging two-photon\\nfabrication, PLA guarantees high resolution and structural integrity,\\npositioning it as a transformative tool for nanoscale 3D printing. With\\napplications spanning research and industry, PLA paves the way for advanced\\noptical devices, micro/nanofabrications, and next-gen manufacturing\\ntechnologies.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T03:18:54Z\"}"}
