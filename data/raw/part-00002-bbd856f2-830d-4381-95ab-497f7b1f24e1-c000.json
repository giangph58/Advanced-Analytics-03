For even $n=2l$, we identify a novel SPT$^2$ phase characterized by\\ntwo distinct topological sectors, exhibiting exact degeneracy at the matrix\\nproduct state (MPS) exactly solvable point. Through Gutzwiller-projected\\nmean-field theory and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations,\\nwe demonstrate that these sectors remain topologically degenerate throughout\\nthe SPT$^2$ phase, with energy gaps decaying exponentially with system size.\\nFor odd $n=2l+1$, we show that the ground state remains unique. We precisely\\ncharacterize critical states using entanglement entropy scaling, confirming the\\ncentral charges predicted by conformal field theories. Our results reveal\\nfundamental differences between even and odd $n$ cases, provide numerical\\nverification of topological protection, and establish reliable methods for\\nstudying high-symmetry quantum systems. The Gutzwiller-guided DMRG is\\ndemonstrated to be notably efficient in targeting specific topological sectors.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T06:59:18Z\"}"}
