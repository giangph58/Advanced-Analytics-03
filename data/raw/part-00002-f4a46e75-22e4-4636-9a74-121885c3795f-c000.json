{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19543v1\", \"title\": \"Apodictic discourse and the Cauchy-Bunyakovsky-Schwarz inequality\", \"summary\": \"Bunyakovsky's integral inequality (1859) is one of the familiar tools of\\nmodern Analysis. We try and understand what Bunyakovsky did, why he did it, why\\nothers did not follow the same path, and explore some of the mathematical\\n(re)interpretations of his inequalities. This is achieved by treating the texts\\nas discourses that provide motivation and proofs by their very discursive\\nstructure, in addition to what meets the eye at first reading. Bunyakovsky\\npaper is an outgrowth of the mathematical theory of mean-values in Cauchy's\\nwork (1821), but viewed from the point of view of Probability and Statistics.\\nLiouville (1836) gave a result that implies Bunyakovsky's inequality, but did\\nnot identify it as significant because his interests lay elsewhere. Grassmann\\n(1862) stated the inequality in abstract form but did not prove it for reasons\\nthat can be identified. Finally, by relating the result to quadratic binary\\nforms, Schwarz (1885) opened the way to a geometric interpretation of the\\ninequality that became important in the theory of integral equations. His\\nargument is the source of one of the proofs most commonly taught nowadays. At\\nabout the same time, the Rogers-H{\\\\\\\"o}lder inequality suggested generalizations\\nof Cauchy's and Bunyakovsky's results in an entirely different direction. Later\\nextensions and reinterpretations show that no single result, even now, subsumes\\nall known generalizations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math.FA,math.HO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T07:48:06Z\"}"}
