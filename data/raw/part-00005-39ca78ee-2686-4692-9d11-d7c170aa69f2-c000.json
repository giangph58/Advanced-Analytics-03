{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10464v1\", \"title\": \"Implications of distance duality violation for the $H_0$ tension and\\n  evolving dark energy\", \"summary\": \"We investigate whether a violation of the distance duality relation (DDR),\\n$D_L(z) = (1+z)^2 D_A(z)$, connecting the angular diameter and luminosity\\ndistances, can explain the Hubble tension and alter the evidence for dynamical\\ndark energy in recent cosmological observations. We constrain five\\nphenomenological parameterisations of DDR violation using Baryon Acoustic\\nOscillation measurements from the DESI survey calibrated with the sound horizon\\nderived from \\\\textit{Planck} Cosmic Microwave Background data and the Pantheon+\\nType Ia supernova (SNIa) catalogue calibrated with the supernova absolute\\nmagnitude from S$H_0$ES. We find that two toy models can resolve the tension: a\\nconstant offset in the DDR (equivalent to a shift in the calibration of the\\nSNIa data), $D_L(z)/D_A(z)\\\\simeq 0.925(1+z)^2$, which leaves the hint for\\nevolving dark energy unaffected; or a change in the power-law\\nredshift-dependence of the DDR, restricted to $z\\\\lesssim 1$,\\n$D_L(z)/D_A(z)\\\\simeq(1+z)^{1.866}$, together with a {\\\\it constant} phantom dark\\nenergy equation of state $w\\\\sim -1.155$. The Bayesian evidence slightly favours\\nthe latter model. Our phenomenological approach motivates the investigation of\\nphysical models of DDR violation as a novel way to explain the Hubble tension.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:52:05Z\"}"}
