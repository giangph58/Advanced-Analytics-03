{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15137v1\", \"title\": \"Fully connected twin-field quantum key distribution network\", \"summary\": \"Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a key application in quantum communication,\\nenabling secure key exchange between parties using quantum states. Twin-field\\n(TF) QKD offers a promising solution that surpasses the repeaterless limits,\\nand its measurement-device-independent nature makes it suitable for star-type\\nnetwork architectures. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a fully\\nconnected TF-QKD network architecture, where users prepare quantum signals and\\nsend them to network nodes. These nodes use splitters to route the signals to\\nmeasurement units, enabling secure key distribution among arbitrary users. A\\nproof-of-principle demonstration with three users successfully achieved secure\\nkey sharing over simulated link losses of up to 30 dB, with an average rate of\\n$5.01 \\\\times 10^{-7}$ bit per pulse. Additionally, simulations show that the\\narchitecture can support up to $32$ users with a secure key rate of 280.90\\nbits/s under typical fiber loss conditions. This approach represents a\\nsignificant advancement in the topology of untrusted-node QKD networks and\\nholds promise for practical, large-scale applications in secure communication.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T14:39:59Z\"}"}
