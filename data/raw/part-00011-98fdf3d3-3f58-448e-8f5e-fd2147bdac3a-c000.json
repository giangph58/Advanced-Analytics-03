{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04088v1\", \"title\": \"SMMT: Siamese Motion Mamba with Self-attention for Thermal Infrared\\n  Target Tracking\", \"summary\": \"Thermal infrared (TIR) object tracking often suffers from challenges such as\\ntarget occlusion, motion blur, and background clutter, which significantly\\ndegrade the performance of trackers. To address these issues, this paper\\npro-poses a novel Siamese Motion Mamba Tracker (SMMT), which integrates a\\nbidirectional state-space model and a self-attention mechanism. Specifically,\\nwe introduce the Motion Mamba module into the Siamese architecture to ex-tract\\nmotion features and recover overlooked edge details using bidirectional\\nmodeling and self-attention. We propose a Siamese parameter-sharing strate-gy\\nthat allows certain convolutional layers to share weights. This approach\\nreduces computational redundancy while preserving strong feature\\nrepresen-tation. In addition, we design a motion edge-aware regression loss to\\nimprove tracking accuracy, especially for motion-blurred targets. Extensive\\nexperi-ments are conducted on four TIR tracking benchmarks, including\\nLSOTB-TIR, PTB-TIR, VOT-TIR2015, and VOT-TIR 2017. The results show that SMMT\\nachieves superior performance in TIR target tracking.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T03:02:04Z\"}"}
