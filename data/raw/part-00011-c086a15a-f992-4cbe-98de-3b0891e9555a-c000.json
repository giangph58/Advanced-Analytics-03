A\\ncore component of the algorithm is the approximate contraction of the iPEPS,\\nwhere the computational bottleneck typically lies in the singular value or\\neigenvalue decompositions involved in the renormalization step. This is\\nparticularly true on GPUs, where tensor contractions are substantially faster\\nthan these decompositions. Here we propose a contraction scheme for\\n$C_{4v}$-symmetric tensor networks based on combining the corner transfer\\nmatrix renormalization group (CTMRG) with QR-decompositions which are\\nsubstantially faster -- especially on GPUs. Our approach achieves up to two\\norders of magnitude speedup compared to standard CTMRG and yields\\nstate-of-the-art results for the Heisenberg and $J_1$-$J_2$ models in about one\\nhour on an H100 GPU.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T12:48:26Z\"}"}
