In the first part of the paper\\nwe focus on $\\\\mathrm{SU}(n)$ gauge theories with two antisymmetric chirals. The\\ngauge theories are non-anomalous if we consider, in addition to such matter\\ncontent, $n_f$ fundamental and $n_a$ antifundamental chirals, provided the\\nconstraint $n_f+n_a=4$. By exploring the five possibile scenarios arising from\\nthis constraint we provide in each case evidences of a dual LG description, by\\nmatching the 't Hooft anomalies and deriving the relation between the elliptic\\ngenera in terms of other more fundamental dualities. In the second part of the\\npaper we provide a 4d origin for a gauge/LG duality already stated in the\\nliterature, that does not descend from any known s-confining duality. In the\\nlast part of the paper we focus on dualities for $\\\\mathrm{SU}(n)$ and\\n$\\\\mathrm{USp}(2n)$ models with antisymmetric Fermi multiplets, obtained from\\ndimensional reduction of 4d parent dualities.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T09:19:30Z\"}"}
