{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15215v1\", \"title\": \"An experimental study of the influence of anonymous information on\\n  social media users\", \"summary\": \"Increasingly, people use social media for their day-to-day interactions and\\nas a source of information, even though much of this information is practically\\nanonymous. This raises the question: does anonymous information influence its\\nrecipients? We conducted an online, two-phase, preregistered experiment using a\\nnationally representative sample of participants from the U.S. to find the\\nanswer. To avoid biases of opinions among participants, in the first phase,\\neach participant examines ten Rorschach inkblots and chooses one of four\\nopinions assigned to each inkblot. In the second phase, the participants are\\nrandomly assigned to one of four distinct information conditions and are asked\\nto revisit their opinions for the same ten inkblots. Conditions ranged from\\nrepeating phase one to receiving anonymous comments about certain opinions.\\nResults were consistent with the preregistration. Importantly, anonymous\\ncomments shown in phase two influence up to half of the participants' opinion\\nselections. To better understand the role of anonymous comments in influencing\\nthe selections of opinions, we implemented agent-based modeling (ABM). ABM\\nresults suggest that a straightforward mechanism can explain the impact of such\\ninformation. Overall, our results indicate that even anonymous information can\\nhave a significant impact on its recipients, potentially altering their\\npopularity rankings. However, the strength of such influence weakens when\\nrecipients' confidence in their selections increases. Additionally, we found\\nthat participants' confidence in the first phase is inversely related to the\\nnumber of change opinions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SI\", \"categories\": \"cs.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T16:39:17Z\"}"}
