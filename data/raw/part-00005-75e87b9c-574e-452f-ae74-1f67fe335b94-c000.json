Considering a one-dimensional (1D) Rashba nanowire (RNW)\\nproximitized to a regular $s$-wave superconductor and a $d$-wave AM, we\\ngenerate both $0$- and $\\\\pi$-FMEMs by driving the nontopological phase of the\\nstatic system. While the static counterpart hosts both topological Majorana\\nzero modes (MZMs) and non-topological accidental zero modes (AZMs), the drive\\ncan gap out the static AZMs and generate robust $\\\\pi$-FMEMs, termed as\\ntopological AZMs (TAZMs). We topologically characterize the emergent FMEMs via\\ndynamical winding numbers exploiting chiral symmetry of the system. Moreover,\\nwe consider a periodically driven Josephson junction comprising of RNW/AM-based\\n1D topological superconduting setup. We identify the signature of MZMs and\\nFMEMs utilizing $4\\\\pi$-periodic Josephson effect, distinguishing them from\\ntrivial AZMs exhibiting $2\\\\pi$-periodicty, in both static and driven platforms.\\nThis Josephson current signal due to Majorana modes survives even in presence\\nof finite disorder. Our work establishes a route to realize and identify FMEMs\\nin AM-based platforms through Floquet engineering and Josephson current\\nresponse.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:43:26Z\"}"}
