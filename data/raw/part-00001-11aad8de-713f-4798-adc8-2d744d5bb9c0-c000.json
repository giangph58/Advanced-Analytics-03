In this article, a state-of-the-art theory prediction for\\n$\\\\tau^+\\\\tau^-$ production including leptonic $\\\\tau$-decays is provided. The\\nimpact of spin correlations between the $\\\\tau$-leptons, of the masses of\\nfinal-state leptons, of next-to-leading-order electroweak corrections, and of\\nthe parametrization of the photon flux are discussed.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T17:00:47Z\"}"}
