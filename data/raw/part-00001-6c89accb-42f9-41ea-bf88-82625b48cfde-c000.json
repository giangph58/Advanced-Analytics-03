In this paper, we couple a discrete memristor model\\nwith a chaotic map to investigate the memristor's impact on the stability of\\nchaotic attractors. Our results reveal that introducing the memristor\\nsubstantially enlarges the basin of attraction of a given chaotic attractor,\\nthereby enhancing its stability. This phenomenon arises as a direct consequence\\nof the memory and switching effects introduced by the memristor, which create\\nnew paths to the chaotic attractors.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.CD\", \"categories\": \"nlin.CD\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:17:17Z\"}"}
