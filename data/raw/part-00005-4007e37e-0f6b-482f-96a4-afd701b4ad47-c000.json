{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12010v1\", \"title\": \"Dual-Energy Cone-Beam CT Using Two Orthogonal Projection Views: A\\n  Phantom Study\", \"summary\": \"This study proposes a novel imaging and reconstruction framework for\\ndual-energy cone-beam CT (DECBCT) using only two orthogonal X-ray projections\\nat different energy levels (2V-DECBCT). The goal is to enable fast and low-dose\\nDE volumetric imaging with high spectral fidelity and structural accuracy,\\nsuitable for DECBCT-guided radiation therapy. We introduce a framework for\\n2V-DECBCT based on physics-informed dual-domain diffusion models. A\\ncycle-domain training strategy is employed to enforce consistency between\\nprojection and volume reconstructions through a differentiable physics-informed\\nmodule. Furthermore, a spectral-consistency loss is introduced to preserve\\ninter-energy contrast during the generative process. The model is trained and\\nevaluated using 4D XCAT phantom data under realistic anatomical motion. The\\nmethod produces high-fidelity DECBCT volumes from only two views, accurately\\npreserving anatomical boundaries and suppressing artifacts. Subtraction maps\\ncomputed from the reconstructed energy volumes show strong visual and numerical\\nagreement with ground truth. This work presents the first diffusion model-based\\nframework for 2V-DECBCT reconstruction, demonstrating accurate structural and\\nspectral recovery from extremely sparse inputs.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.med-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.med-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T12:05:33Z\"}"}
