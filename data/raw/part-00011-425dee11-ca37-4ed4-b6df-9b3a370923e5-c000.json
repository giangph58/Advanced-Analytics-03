This work further explores\\nthe parallels between these two classes and introduces foundational building\\nblocks for constructing totally equimodular matrices. Consequently, we present\\na decomposition theorem for totally equimodular matrices of full row rank.\\n  Building on this decomposition theorem, we prove that simplicial cones whose\\ngenerators form the rows of a totally equimodular matrix sa\\\\-tisfy strong\\nintegrality decomposition properties. More precisely, we provide the Hilbert\\nbasis for these cones and construct regular unimodular Hilbert triangulations\\nin most cases. We conjecture that cases not covered here do not exist.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,cs.DM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T11:40:59Z\"}"}
