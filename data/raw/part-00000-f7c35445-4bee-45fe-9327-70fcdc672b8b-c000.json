Despite its clinical relevance, detailed data on menstrual\\ncharacteristics is rarely available in structured medical records. To address\\nthis gap, we propose a novel Natural Language Processing pipeline to extract\\nkey menstrual cycle attributes -- dysmenorrhea, regularity, flow volume, and\\nintermenstrual bleeding. Our approach utilizes the GatorTron model with\\nMulti-Task Prompt-based Learning, enhanced by a hybrid retrieval preprocessing\\nstep to identify relevant text segments. It out- performs baseline methods,\\nachieving an average F1-score of 90% across all menstrual characteristics,\\ndespite being trained on fewer than 100 annotated clinical notes. The retrieval\\nstep consistently improves performance across all approaches, allowing the\\nmodel to focus on the most relevant segments of lengthy clinical notes. These\\nresults show that combining multi-task learning with retrieval improves\\ngeneralization and performance across menstrual charac- teristics, advancing\\nautomated extraction from clinical notes and supporting women's health\\nresearch.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:07:03Z\"}"}
