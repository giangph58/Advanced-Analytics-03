{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04584v1\", \"title\": \"SlideItRight: Using AI to Find Relevant Slides and Provide Feedback for\\n  Open-Ended Questions\", \"summary\": \"Feedback is important in supporting student learning. While various automated\\nfeedback systems have been implemented to make the feedback scalable, many\\nexisting solutions only focus on generating text-based feedback. As is\\nindicated in the multimedia learning principle, learning with more modalities\\ncould help utilize more separate channels, reduce the cognitive load and\\nfacilitate students' learning. Hence, it is important to explore the potential\\nof Artificial Intelligence (AI) in feedback generation from and to different\\nmodalities. Our study leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for textual\\nfeedback with the supplementary guidance from other modality - relevant lecture\\nslide retrieved from the slides hub. Through an online crowdsourcing study\\n(N=91), this study investigates learning gains and student perceptions using a\\n2x2 design (i.e., human feedback vs. AI feedback and with vs. without relevant\\nslide), evaluating the clarity, engagement, perceived effectiveness, and\\nreliability) of AI-facilitated multimodal feedback. We observed significant\\npre-to-post learning gains across all conditions. However, the differences in\\nthese gains were not statistically significant between conditions. The\\npost-survey revealed that students found the slide feedback helpful in their\\nlearning process, though they reported difficulty in understanding it.\\nRegarding the AI-generated open-ended feedback, students considered it\\npersonalized and relevant to their responses, but they expressed lower trust in\\nthe AI feedback compared to human-generated feedback.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T17:24:40Z\"}"}
