Our framework\\nproduces dual bulk descriptions -- gapped foliated and exotic SymTFTs -- that\\ngenerates gapless boundary theories with spontaneous subsystem symmetry\\nbreaking via interval compactification. In analogy with the sandwich\\nconstruction of SymTFT, we call this Mille-feuille. This is done by specifying\\ngapped and symmetry-breaking boundary conditions. In this way we obtain the\\nfoliated dual realizations of various models, including the XY plaquette, XYZ\\ncube, and $\\\\phi$, $\\\\hat{\\\\phi}$ theories. This also captures self-duality\\nsymmetries as condensation defects and provides a systematic method for\\ngenerating free theories that non-linearly realize subsystem symmetries.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T17:57:58Z\"}"}
