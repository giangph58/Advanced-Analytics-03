{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17574v1\", \"title\": \"RAGAT-Mind: A Multi-Granular Modeling Approach for Rumor Detection Based\\n  on MindSpore\", \"summary\": \"As false information continues to proliferate across social media platforms,\\neffective rumor detection has emerged as a pressing challenge in natural\\nlanguage processing. This paper proposes RAGAT-Mind, a multi-granular modeling\\napproach for Chinese rumor detection, built upon the MindSpore deep learning\\nframework. The model integrates TextCNN for local semantic extraction,\\nbidirectional GRU for sequential context learning, Multi-Head Self-Attention\\nfor global dependency focusing, and Bidirectional Graph Convolutional Networks\\n(BiGCN) for structural representation of word co-occurrence graphs. Experiments\\non the Weibo1-Rumor dataset demonstrate that RAGAT-Mind achieves superior\\nclassification performance, attaining 99.2% accuracy and a macro-F1 score of\\n0.9919. The results validate the effectiveness of combining hierarchical\\nlinguistic features with graph-based semantic structures. Furthermore, the\\nmodel exhibits strong generalization and interpretability, highlighting its\\npractical value for real-world rumor detection applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:03:53Z\"}"}
