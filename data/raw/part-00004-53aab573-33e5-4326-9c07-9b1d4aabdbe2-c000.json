{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12295v1\", \"title\": \"Murmurations for elliptic curves ordered by height\", \"summary\": \"He, Lee, Oliver, and Pozdnyakov [19] have empirically observed that the\\naverage of the $p$th coefficients of the $L$-functions of elliptic curves of\\nparticular ranks in a given range of conductors $N$ appears to approximate a\\ncontinuous function of $p$, depending primarily on the parity of the rank.\\nHence the sum of $p$th coefficients against the root number also appears to\\napproximate a continuous function, dubbed the murmuration density. However, it\\nis not clear from this numerical data how to obtain an explicit formula for the\\nmurmuration density. Convergence of similar averages was proved by Zubrilina\\n[32] for modular forms of weight 2 (of which elliptic curves form a thin\\nsubset) and analogous results for other families of automorphic forms have been\\nobtained in further work [6,23]. Each of these works gives an explicit formula\\nfor the murmuration density. We consider a variant problem where the elliptic\\ncurves are ordered by naive height, and the $p$th coefficients are averaged\\nover $p/N$ in a fixed interval. We give a conjecture for the murmuration\\ndensity in this case, as an explicit but complicated sum of Bessel functions.\\nThis conjecture is motivated by a theorem about a variant problem where we sum\\nthe $n$th coefficients for $n$ with no small prime factors against a smooth\\nweight function. We test this conjecture for elliptic curves of naive height up\\nto $2^{28}$ and find good agreement with the data. The theorem is proved using\\nthe Voronoi summation formula, and the method should apply to many different\\nfamilies of $L$-functions. This is the first work to give an explicit formula\\nfor the murmuration density of a family of elliptic curves, in any ordering.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T17:56:37Z\"}"}
