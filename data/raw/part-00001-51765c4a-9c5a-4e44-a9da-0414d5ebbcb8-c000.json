These critical points are referred to as horizontally harmonic\\n  maps. In particular, if the maps are foliated, they become transversally\\n  harmonic maps. By utilizing the stress-energy tensor, we establish some\\n  monotonicity formulas for horizontally harmonic maps from Euclidean spaces,\\n  the quotients $K_{m}$ of Heisenberg groups and also for transversally\\n  harmonic maps from Riemannian foliations with appropriate curvature pinching\\n  conditions. Finally, we give Jin-type theorems for either horizontally\\n  harmonic maps or transversally harmonic maps under some asymptotic\\n  conditions at infinity.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:50:59Z\"}"}
