To simulate\\npatient-health educator dialogues, we employed four prompting strategies:\\ndomain, African American Vernacular English (AAVE), Social Determinants of\\nHealth (SDOH), and SDOH-informed reasoning. Conversations were generated across\\nkey self-care domains of food, exercise, and fluid intake, with varying turn\\nlengths (5, 10, 15) and incorporated patient-specific SDOH attributes such as\\nage, gender, neighborhood, and socioeconomic status. Our findings show that\\neffective prompt design is essential. While incorporating SDOH and reasoning\\nimproves dialogue quality, ChatGPT still lacks the empathy and engagement\\nneeded for meaningful healthcare communication.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T16:21:10Z\"}"}
