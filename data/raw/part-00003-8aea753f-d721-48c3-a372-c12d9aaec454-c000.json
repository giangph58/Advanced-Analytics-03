This\\nwork-in-progress paper introduces a HIPAA-compliant Agentic AI framework that\\nenforces regulatory compliance through dynamic, context-aware policy\\nenforcement. Our framework integrates three core mechanisms: (1)\\nAttribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for granular PHI governance, (2) a hybrid\\nPHI sanitization pipeline combining regex patterns and BERT-based model to\\nminimize leakage, and (3) immutable audit trails for compliance verification.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MA\", \"categories\": \"cs.MA,cs.AI,cs.ET\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:38:20Z\"}"}
