{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21587v1\", \"title\": \"Long time dynamics of the Cauchy problem for the predator-prey model\\n  with cross-diffusion\", \"summary\": \"This paper is concerned with a predator-prey model in $N$-dimensional spaces\\n($N=1, 2, 3$), given by \\\\begin{align*}\\\\left\\\\{\\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\nu}{\\\\partial t}=\\\\Delta u-\\\\chi\\\\nabla\\\\cdot(u\\\\nabla v),\\\\\\\\ &\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\nv}{\\\\partial t}=\\\\Delta v+\\\\xi\\\\nabla\\\\cdot(v\\\\nabla u), \\\\end{aligned}\\\\right.\\n\\\\end{align*} which describes random movement of both predator and prey species,\\nas well as the spatial dynamics involving predators pursuing prey and prey\\nattempting to evade predators. It is shown that any global strong solutions of\\nthe corresponding Cauchy problem converge to zero in the sense of $L^p$-norm\\nfor any $1<p\\\\le \\\\infty$, and also converge to the heat kernel with respect to\\n$L^p$-norm for any $1\\\\le p\\\\le \\\\infty$. In particular, the decay rate thereof is\\noptimal in the sense that it is consistent with that of the heat equation in\\n$\\\\mathbb R^N$ ($N=2, 3$). Undoubtedly, the global existence of solutions\\nappears to be among the most challenging topic in the analysis of this model.\\n  Indeed even in the one-dimensional setting, only global weak solutions in a\\nbounded domain have been successfully constructed by far. Nevertheless, to\\nprovide a comprehensive understanding of the main results, we append the\\nconclusion on the global existence and asymptotic behavior of strong solutions,\\nalthough certain smallness conditions on the initial data are required.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T12:44:47Z\"}"}
