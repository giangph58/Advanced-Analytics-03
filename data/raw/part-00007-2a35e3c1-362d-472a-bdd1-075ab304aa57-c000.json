{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16852v1\", \"title\": \"Fair division of the replacement-units without an appraiser in urban\\n  renewal processes\", \"summary\": \"Rebuild and Divide is an urban renewal process that involves the demolition\\nof old buildings and the construction of new ones. Original homeowners are\\ncompensated with upgraded apartments, while surplus units are sold for profit,\\nso theoretically it is a win-win project for all parties involved. However,\\nmany rebuild-and-divide projects withheld or delayed due to disagreements over\\nthe assignment of new units, claiming they are not \\\"fair\\\". The goal of this\\nresearch is to develop algorithms for envy-free allocation of the new units.\\nThe main challenge is that, in contrast to previous work on envy-free\\nallocation, the envy depends also on the value of the old units, as people with\\nmore valuable old units are entitled to more valuable new units. We introduce\\nthree models that capture different notions of fairness: (1) the Difference\\nModel, where agents evaluate their gains relative to others; (2) the Envy Sum\\nModel, which permits some envy as long as the total envy does not exceed that\\nof the original allocation; and (3) the Ratio Model, where fairness is assessed\\nbased on the proportional value of old apartments. For each model, we establish\\nan envy criterion and seek a payment vector and allocation that ensure\\nenvy-freeness. These models present both theoretical challenges and intriguing\\ninsights. Additionally, within the Envy Sum Model, we present a mechanism that\\ncomputes an allocation and payment scheme that minimizes total envy. We also\\nanalyze the mechanism's vulnerability to manipulation and identify conditions\\nunder which it is obviously manipulable.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GT\", \"categories\": \"cs.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T16:19:55Z\"}"}
