{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05399v1\", \"title\": \"Scheimpflug cameras for range-resolved observations of the atmospheric\\n  effects on laser propagation\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents the development of Scheimpflug cameras for lidar and\\nremote sensing with an emphasis on active and passive range-finding.\\nScheimpflug technology uses a tilted camera geometry to natively encode 3D\\ninformation through projected off-axis pixel view angles and holds the unique\\npotential to serve as an alternative to traditional lidar and remote sensing\\nsystems with the demonstrated advantages of high configurability, SWaP-C (Size,\\nWeight and Power-Cost) efficiency and short- vs. far-range optimization. In\\nthis work, we demonstrate several compact Scheimpflug-enabled systems as a\\nsnapshot atmospheric lidar detector to measure aerosol extinction and optical\\nturbulence effects with high precision over ranges from a few meters to a few\\nkilometer. We compare the instrument's measurements to variance-based Cn2 data\\ncollected by a conic anemometer and scintillometer over a 50 m horizontal path.\\nThis paper also presents preliminary results on utilizing Scheimpflug\\ntechnology for photogrammetry, 2D/3D mapping and includes a generalized\\ndiscussion on the design, alignment and calibration procedures. We believe this\\nwork provides a strong basis for the broad use of Scheimpflug technology across\\nmultiple use-cases with the fields of lidar and remote sensing.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T16:34:43Z\"}"}
