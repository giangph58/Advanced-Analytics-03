Two synthetic strategies were\\ndeveloped to construct rigid cores, resulting in the successful synthesis of\\nten compounds with varied terminal groups and lateral substituents.\\nCorrelations between molecular structure and mesomorphic properties were\\nelucidated through extensive comparative analysis. Birefringence measurements\\nand quantum chemical calculations further provided insights into the optical\\nproperties and polarizability anisotropy of the synthesized compounds. The\\nresults highlight the influence of structural diversity on the compounds'\\nsuitability for microwave applications. Specifically, compounds featuring\\ncarbon-carbon triple bonds and polar terminal groups demonstrated enhanced\\nbirefringence and polarizability values, indicating their potential in\\nmicrowave device fabrication.
