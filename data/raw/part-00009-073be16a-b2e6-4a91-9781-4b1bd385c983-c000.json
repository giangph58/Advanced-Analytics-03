{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04466v1\", \"title\": \"Securing Immersive 360 Video Streams through Attribute-Based Selective\\n  Encryption\", \"summary\": \"Delivering high-quality, secure 360{\\\\deg} video content introduces unique\\nchallenges, primarily due to the high bitrates and interactive demands of\\nimmersive media. Traditional HTTPS-based methods, although widely used, face\\nlimitations in computational efficiency and scalability when securing these\\nhigh-resolution streams. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel\\nframework integrating Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) with selective\\nencryption techniques tailored specifically for tiled 360{\\\\deg} video\\nstreaming. Our approach employs selective encryption of frames at varying\\nlevels to reduce computational overhead while ensuring robust protection\\nagainst unauthorized access.\\n  Moreover, we explore viewport-adaptive encryption, dynamically encrypting\\nmore frames within tiles occupying larger portions of the viewer's field of\\nview. This targeted method significantly enhances security in critical viewing\\nareas without unnecessary overhead in peripheral regions. We deploy and\\nevaluate our proposed approach using the CloudLab testbed, comparing its\\nperformance against traditional HTTPS streaming. Experimental results\\ndemonstrate that our ABE-based model achieves reduced computational load on\\nintermediate caches, improves cache hit rates, and maintains comparable visual\\nquality to HTTPS, as assessed by Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion (VMAF).\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MM\", \"categories\": \"cs.MM,cs.CR,eess.IV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:37:13Z\"}"}
