To address these\\nchallenges and more accurately reflect the complexities faced by modern cloud\\nenvironments, we introduce the Dynamic VM Allocation problem in Multi-NUMA PM\\n(DVAMP). We formally define both offline and online versions of DVAMP as\\nmixed-integer linear programming problems, providing a rigorous mathematical\\nfoundation for analysis. A tight performance bound for greedy online algorithms\\nis derived, offering insights into the worst-case optimality gap as a function\\nof the number of physical machines and VM lifetime variability. To address the\\nchallenges posed by DVAMP, we propose SPANE (Symmetry-Preserving Architecture\\nfor Multi-NUMA Environments), a novel deep reinforcement learning approach that\\nexploits the problem's inherent symmetries. SPANE produces invariant results\\nunder arbitrary permutations of physical machine states, enhancing learning\\nefficiency and solution quality. Extensive experiments conducted on the\\nHuawei-East-1 dataset demonstrate that SPANE outperforms existing baselines,\\nreducing average VM wait time by 45%. Our work contributes to the field of\\ncloud resource management by providing both theoretical insights and practical\\nsolutions for VM scheduling in multi-NUMA environments, addressing a critical\\ngap in the literature and offering improved performance for real-world cloud\\nsystems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T08:09:40Z\"}"}
