Over\\nthe past 15 years, the miniaturization of silicon-based nanoelectronics\\npredicted by Moore's law has driven an aggressive scaling down of the\\ntransistor structure, including materials, design, and geometries. In this\\nregard, the electronic device community has expanded its focus to ultrascaled\\ntransistors targeting 7-nm technology node and beyond. However, these emerging\\nnanodevices are also creating thermal issues that could evidently limit their\\ncarrier transfer as a result of strong electron-phonon coupling. We aim to\\nexplain the physical origin of self-heating effects in an ultrascaled 5-nm\\nsilicon nanowire Field-Effect Transistor. On the basis of the quantum\\nhydrodynamic approach, a possible explanation of phonon drag contribution to\\nthermal conductivity is also discussed. To the best of our knowledge, we report\\nfor the first time the impact of the phonon drag effect on the electrical and\\nthermal performance of 5nm gate-all-around silicon nanowire field-effect\\ntransistors. Our findings provide a deep insight into the origin of\\nself-heating as a result of mutual electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we\\nfurther demonstrate that the phonon drag effect significantly reduces thermal\\nconductivity by nearly 50\\\\% under high bias conditions.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T08:29:28Z\"}"}
