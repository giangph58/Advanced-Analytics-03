{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20383v1\", \"title\": \"Neural Stereo Video Compression with Hybrid Disparity Compensation\", \"summary\": \"Disparity compensation represents the primary strategy in stereo video\\ncompression (SVC) for exploiting cross-view redundancy. These mechanisms can be\\nbroadly categorized into two types: one that employs explicit horizontal\\nshifting, and another that utilizes an implicit cross-attention mechanism to\\nreduce cross-view disparity redundancy. In this work, we propose a hybrid\\ndisparity compensation (HDC) strategy that leverages explicit pixel\\ndisplacement as a robust prior feature to simplify optimization and perform\\nimplicit cross-attention mechanisms for subsequent warping operations, thereby\\ncapturing a broader range of disparity information. Specifically, HDC first\\ncomputes a similarity map by fusing the horizontally shifted cross-view\\nfeatures to capture pixel displacement information. This similarity map is then\\nnormalized into an \\\"explicit pixel-wise attention score\\\" to perform the\\ncross-attention mechanism, implicitly aligning features from one view to\\nanother. Building upon HDC, we introduce a novel end-to-end optimized neural\\nstereo video compression framework, which integrates HDC-based modules into key\\ncoding operations, including cross-view feature extraction and reconstruction\\n(HDC-FER) and cross-view entropy modeling (HDC-EM). Extensive experiments on\\nSVC benchmarks, including KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015, and Nagoya, which cover both\\nautonomous driving and general scenes, demonstrate that our framework\\noutperforms both neural and traditional SVC methodologies.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,eess.IV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T03:04:09Z\"}"}
