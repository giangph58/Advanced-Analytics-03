{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10347v1\", \"title\": \"Uncertain Location Transmitter and UAV-Aided Warden Based LEO Satellite\\n  Covert Communication Systems\", \"summary\": \"We propose a novel covert communication system in which a ground user, Alice,\\ntransmits unauthorized message fragments to Bob, a low-Earth orbit satellite\\n(LEO), and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) warden (Willie) attempts to detect\\nthese transmissions. The key contribution is modeling a scenario where Alice\\nand Willie are unaware of each other's exact locations and move randomly within\\na specific area. Alice utilizes environmental obstructions to avoid detection\\nand only transmits when the satellite is directly overhead. LEO satellite\\ntechnology allows users to avoid transmitting messages near a base station. We\\nintroduce two key performance metrics: catch probability (Willie detects and\\nlocates Alice during a message chunk transmission) and overall catch\\nprobability over multiple message chunks. We analyze how two parameters impact\\nthese metrics: 1) the size of the detection window and 2) the number of message\\nchunks. The paper proposes two algorithms to optimize these parameters. The\\nsimulation results show that the algorithms effectively reduce the detection\\nrisks. This work advances the understanding of covert communication under\\nmobility and uncertainty in satellite-aided systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T15:55:31Z\"}"}
