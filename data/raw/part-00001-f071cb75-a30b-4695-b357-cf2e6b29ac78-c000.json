ASASSN-24hd is the first reported WZ Sge-type DN\\noutburst fully covered by TESS, providing a great opportunity to study the\\nevolution of superhumps. Our observations establish its early and stage-A\\nordinary superhumps as 0.05711(4) and 0.05919(5) d, respectively, resulting in\\nits mass ratio of 0.098(4). The TESS observations confirm that the evolution of\\nits superhump period, amplitude, and profile after the appearance of ordinary\\nsuperhumps is generally consistent with those of SU UMa-type DNe observed with\\nKepler and TESS. Furthermore, we find that ASASSN-24hd in outburst shares a\\ngreat similarity to the 2010 superoutburst of an SU UMa-type DN V585 Lyr,\\nobserved by Kepler, particularly including the superhump evolution and the long\\nwaiting time ($\\\\gtrsimeq$ 5 d) before the stage A--B transition of ordinary\\nsuperhumps. The shorter superoutburst cycles and smaller outburst amplitude in\\nV585 Lyr than those of ASASSN-24hd disfavor the interpretation that V585 Lyr\\nis, in fact, a face-on WZ Sge-type DN where early superhumps are undetectable.\\nInstead, one possibility of their critical differences is either low quiescence\\nviscosity or inner disk truncation, which has been invoked to explain the\\nextreme nature of WZ Sge-type DNe, but future observations in quiescence are\\nvital to conclude. These findings emphasize the borderline between SU UMa-type\\nand WZ Sge-type DNe.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:00:50Z\"}"}
