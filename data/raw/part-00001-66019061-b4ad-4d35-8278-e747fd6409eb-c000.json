{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16821v1\", \"title\": \"From Diverse Origins to a DEI Crisis: The Pushback Against Equity,\\n  Diversity, and Inclusion in Software Engineering\", \"summary\": \"Background: Diversity, equity, and inclusion are rooted in the very origins\\nof software engineering, shaped by the contributions from many individuals from\\nunderrepresented groups to the field. Yet today, DEI efforts in the industry\\nface growing resistance. As companies retreat from visible commitments, and\\npushback initiatives started only a few years ago. Aims: This study explores\\nhow the DEI backlash is unfolding in the software industry by investigating\\ninstitutional changes, lived experiences, and the strategies used to sustain\\nDEI practices. Method: We conducted an exploratory case study using 59 publicly\\navailable Reddit posts authored by self-identified software professionals. Data\\nwere analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. Results: Our findings show\\nthat software companies are responding to the DEI backlash in varied ways,\\nincluding re-structuring programs, scaling back investments, or quietly\\ncontinuing efforts under new labels. Professionals reported a wide range of\\nemotional responses, from anxiety and frustration to relief and happiness,\\nshaped by identity, role, and organizational culture. Yet, despite the\\nbacklash, multiple forms of resistance and adaptation have emerged to protect\\ninclusive practices in software engineering. Conclusions: The DEI backlash is\\nreshaping DEI in software engineering. While public messaging may soften or\\ndisappear, core DEI values persist in adapted forms. This study offers a new\\nperspective into how inclusion is evolving under pressure and highlights the\\nresilience of DEI in software environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:39:15Z\"}"}
