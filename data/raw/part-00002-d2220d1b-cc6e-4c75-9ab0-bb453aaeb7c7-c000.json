Our hybrid\\ndensity functional theory calculations show that self-trapped holes (STHs)\\nlocalize on oxygen atoms within a single unit cell and exhibit \\\\emph{p}-orbital\\ncharacteristics. The inclusion of isoelectronic dopants such as Al and In\\nreduces but does not remove the absorption of visible light due to STH\\nformation. The combination of a positive STH formation energy, large lattice\\ndistortions, and emergent acceptor levels, coupled with the observed\\nred-shifted, visible spectrum, emergent absorption peaks, implies that\\nalternative doping/alloying strategies are necessary to achieve effective\\np-type conductivity in orthorhombic k-Ga2O3.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T04:20:23Z\"}"}
