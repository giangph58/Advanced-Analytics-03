Examples of successor\\nstructure include ordered tuples, cyclic lists and multisets. Motivated by\\ngoals in automata-based verification and results on thin trees, we introduce\\nthin coalgebras as those coalgebras with only countably many infinite paths\\nfrom each state. Our main result is an inductive characterisation of thinness\\nvia an initial algebra. To this end, we develop a syntax for thin behaviours\\nand capture with a single equation when two terms represent the same thin\\nbehaviour. Finally, for the special case of polynomial functors, we retrieve\\nfrom our syntax the notion of Cantor-Bendixson rank of a thin tree.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.FL\", \"categories\": \"cs.FL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T16:31:07Z\"}"}
