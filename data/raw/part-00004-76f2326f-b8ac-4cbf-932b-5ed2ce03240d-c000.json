We show that there is a unique evolution\\nbeyond SCS such that a propagating shock wave forms, the metric remains\\ncontinuous, and the stress-energy tensor dynamically becomes that of a thin\\nshell. We give numerical simulations that exhibit this result.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T06:23:12Z\"}"}
