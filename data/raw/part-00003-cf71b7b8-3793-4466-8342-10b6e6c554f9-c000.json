{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10187v1\", \"title\": \"Deep Reasoning Translation via Reinforcement Learning\", \"summary\": \"Recently, deep reasoning LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o1/o3 and DeepSeek-R1) have shown\\npromising performance in various complex tasks. Free translation is an\\nimportant and interesting task in the multilingual world, which requires going\\nbeyond word-for-word translation and taking cultural differences into account.\\nThis task is still under-explored in deep reasoning LLMs. In this paper, we\\nintroduce DeepTrans, a deep reasoning translation model that learns free\\ntranslation via reinforcement learning. Specifically, we carefully build a\\nreward model with pre-defined scoring criteria on both the translation results\\nand the thought process. Given the source sentences, the reward model teaches\\nthe deep translation model how to think and free-translate them during\\nreinforcement learning. In this way, training DeepTrans does not need any\\nlabeled translations, avoiding the human-intensive annotation or\\nresource-intensive data synthesis. Experimental results show the effectiveness\\nof DeepTrans. Using Qwen2.5-7B as the backbone, DeepTrans improves performance\\nby 16.3% in literature translation, and outperforms strong deep reasoning\\nbaselines as well as baselines that are fine-tuned with synthesized data.\\nMoreover, we summarize the failures and interesting findings during our RL\\nexploration. We hope this work could inspire other researchers in free\\ntranslation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T12:40:39Z\"}"}
