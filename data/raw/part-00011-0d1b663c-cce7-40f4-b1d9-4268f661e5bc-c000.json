{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02693v1\", \"title\": \"Joint Modeling of Spatial Dependencies Across Multiple Subjects in\\n  Multiplexed Tissue Imaging\", \"summary\": \"The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a spatially heterogeneous ecosystem where\\ncellular interactions shape tumor progression and response to therapy.\\nMultiplexed imaging technologies enable high-resolution spatial\\ncharacterization of the TME, yet statistical methods for analyzing\\nmulti-subject spatial tissue data remain limited. We propose a Bayesian\\nhierarchical model for inferring spatial dependencies in multiplexed imaging\\ndatasets across multiple subjects. Our model represents the TME as a\\nmultivariate log-Gaussian Cox process, where spatial intensity functions of\\ndifferent cell types are governed by a latent multivariate Gaussian process. By\\npooling information across subjects, we estimate spatial correlation functions\\nthat capture within-type and cross-type dependencies, enabling interpretable\\ninference about disease-specific cellular organization. We validate our method\\nusing simulations, demonstrating robustness to latent factor specification and\\nspatial resolution. We apply our approach to two multiplexed imaging datasets:\\npancreatic cancer and colorectal cancer, revealing distinct spatial\\norganization patterns across disease subtypes and highlighting tumor-immune\\ninteractions that differentiate immune-permissive and immune-exclusive\\nmicroenvironments. These findings provide insight into mechanisms of immune\\nevasion and may inform novel therapeutic strategies. Our approach offers a\\nprincipled framework for modeling spatial dependencies in multi-subject data,\\nwith broader applicability to spatially resolved omics and imaging studies. An\\nR package, available online, implements our methods.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:32:25Z\"}"}
