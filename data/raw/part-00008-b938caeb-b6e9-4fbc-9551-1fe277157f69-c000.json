{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01369v1\", \"title\": \"LITE: LLM-Impelled efficient Taxonomy Evaluation\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents LITE, an LLM-based evaluation method designed for\\nefficient and flexible assessment of taxonomy quality. To address challenges in\\nlarge-scale taxonomy evaluation, such as efficiency, fairness, and consistency,\\nLITE adopts a top-down hierarchical evaluation strategy, breaking down the\\ntaxonomy into manageable substructures and ensuring result reliability through\\ncross-validation and standardized input formats. LITE also introduces a penalty\\nmechanism to handle extreme cases and provides both quantitative performance\\nanalysis and qualitative insights by integrating evaluation metrics closely\\naligned with task objectives. Experimental results show that LITE demonstrates\\nhigh reliability in complex evaluation tasks, effectively identifying semantic\\nerrors, logical contradictions, and structural flaws in taxonomies, while\\noffering directions for improvement.
