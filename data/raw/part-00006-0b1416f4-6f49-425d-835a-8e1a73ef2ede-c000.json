Hyperspectral near-infrared (NIR) imaging combined with\\nadvanced deep learning algorithms offers a promising solution for efficient\\nfiber classification and sorting. In this study, we investigate supervised and\\nunsupervised deep learning models and test their generalization capabilities on\\ndifferent textile structures. We show that optimized convolutional neural\\nnetworks (CNNs) and autoencoder networks achieve robust generalization under\\nvarying conditions. These results highlight the potential of hyperspectral\\nimaging and deep learning to advance sustainable textile recycling through\\naccurate and robust classification.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T14:34:31Z\"}"}
