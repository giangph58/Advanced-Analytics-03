Since analytically designing these mathematical\\nrepresentations is usually challenging, empirical models based on performance\\nmeasurements offer a practical alternative. Yet, measurements on HPC systems\\nare typically affected by noise, leading to potentially misleading model\\npredictions. To reduce the influence of noise, we introduce\\napplication-specific dynamic priors into the modeling process, which we derive\\nfrom noise-resilient measurements of computational effort and knowledge of\\ntypical algorithms used in communication routines. These priors then narrow the\\nsearch space for our performance models, excluding complexity classes that\\nreflect noise rather than performance. Our approach keeps the models much\\ncloser to theoretical expectations and significantly improves their predictive\\npower. Finally, it cuts experimental costs in half by minimizing the number of\\nrepeated measurements.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.PF\", \"categories\": \"cs.PF,cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T09:14:18Z\"}"}
