{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10354v1\", \"title\": \"The diagonal and Hadamard grade of hypergeometric functions\", \"summary\": \"Diagonals of rational functions are an important class of functions arising\\nin number theory, algebraic geometry, combinatorics, and physics. In this paper\\nwe study the diagonal grade of a function $f$, which is defined to be the\\nsmallest $n$ such that $f$ is the diagonal of a rational function in variables\\n$x_0,\\\\dots, x_n$. We relate the diagonal grade of a function to the nilpotence\\nof the associated differential equation. This allows us to determine the\\ndiagonal grade of many hypergeometric functions and answer affirmatively the\\noutstanding question on the existence of functions with diagonal grade greater\\nthan $2$. In particular, we show that\\n$\\\\prescript{}{n}F_{n-1}(\\\\frac{1}{2},\\\\dots, \\\\frac{1}{2};1\\\\dots,1 \\\\mid x)$ has\\ndiagonal grade $n$ for each $n\\\\geq 1$. Our method also applies to the\\ngenerating function of the Ap\\\\'ery sequence, which we find to have diagonal\\ngrade $3$. We also answer related questions on Hadamard grades posed by\\nAllouche and Mend\\\\`es France. For example, we show that\\n$\\\\prescript{}{n}F_{n-1}(\\\\frac{1}{2},\\\\dots, \\\\frac{1}{2};1\\\\dots,1 \\\\mid x)$ has\\nHadamard grade $n$ for all $n\\\\geq 1$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,math-ph,math.AG,math.MP,math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:03:32Z\"}"}
