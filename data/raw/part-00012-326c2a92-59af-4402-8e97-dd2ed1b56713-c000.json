Our method renders the reconstruction\\nproblem computationally tractable while exhibiting exceptional robustness in\\nthe presence of noise. Central to our theory is the Hantjies tensor -- a\\ncurvature-like invariant that precisely quantifies noise propagation and\\nenables error-bounded reconstructions. This synthesis of differential geometry,\\nintegral analysis, and algebraic topology not only resolves long-standing\\nambiguities in inverse problems but also paves the way for transformative\\napplications across a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:39:39Z\"}"}
