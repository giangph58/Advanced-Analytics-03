{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12254v1\", \"title\": \"Advancing Arabic Speech Recognition Through Large-Scale Weakly\\n  Supervised Learning\", \"summary\": \"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is crucial for human-machine interaction\\nin diverse applications like conversational agents, industrial robotics, call\\ncenter automation, and automated subtitling. However, developing\\nhigh-performance ASR models remains challenging, particularly for low-resource\\nlanguages like Arabic, due to the scarcity of large, labeled speech datasets,\\nwhich are costly and labor-intensive to produce. In this work, we employ weakly\\nsupervised learning to train an Arabic ASR model using the Conformer\\narchitecture. Our model is trained from scratch on 15,000 hours of weakly\\nannotated speech data covering both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and Dialectal\\nArabic (DA), eliminating the need for costly manual transcriptions. Despite the\\nabsence of human-verified labels, our approach attains state-of-the-art (SOTA)\\nperformance, exceeding all previous efforts in the field of Arabic ASR on the\\nstandard benchmarks. By demonstrating the effectiveness of weak supervision as\\na scalable, cost-efficient alternative to traditional supervised approaches,\\npaving the way for improved ASR systems in low resource settings.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T17:05:14Z\"}"}
