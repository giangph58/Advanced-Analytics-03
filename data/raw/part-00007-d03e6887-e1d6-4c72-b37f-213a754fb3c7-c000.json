{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19820v1\", \"title\": \"Hierarchical Uncertainty-Aware Graph Neural Network\", \"summary\": \"Recent research on graph neural networks (GNNs) has explored mechanisms for\\ncapturing local uncertainty and exploiting graph hierarchies to mitigate data\\nsparsity and leverage structural properties. However, the synergistic\\nintegration of these two approaches remains underexplored. In this work, we\\nintroduce a novel architecture, the Hierarchical Uncertainty-Aware Graph Neural\\nNetwork (HU-GNN), which unifies multi-scale representation learning, principled\\nuncertainty estimation, and self-supervised embedding diversity within a single\\nend-to-end framework. Specifically, HU-GNN adaptively forms node clusters and\\nestimates uncertainty at multiple structural scales from individual nodes to\\nhigher levels. These uncertainty estimates guide a robust message-passing\\nmechanism and attention weighting, effectively mitigating noise and adversarial\\nperturbations while preserving predictive accuracy on both node- and\\ngraph-level tasks. We also offer key theoretical contributions, including a\\nprobabilistic formulation, rigorous uncertainty-calibration guarantees, and\\nformal robustness bounds. Finally, by incorporating recent advances in graph\\ncontrastive learning, HU-GNN maintains diverse, structurally faithful\\nembeddings. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our\\nmodel achieves state-of-the-art robustness and interpretability.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:22:18Z\"}"}
