{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11223v1\", \"title\": \"The Simplicial Loop Space of a Simplicial Complex\", \"summary\": \"Given a simplicial complex $X$, we construct a simplicial complex $\\\\Omega X$\\nthat may be regarded as a combinatorial version of the based loop space of a\\ntopological space. Our construction explicitly describes the simplices of\\n$\\\\Omega X$ directly in terms of the simplices of $X$. Working at a purely\\ncombinatorial level, we show two main results that confirm the (combinatorial)\\nalgebraic topology of our $\\\\Omega X$ behaves like that of the topological based\\nloop space. Whereas our $\\\\Omega X$ is generally a disconnected simplical\\ncomplex, each component of $\\\\Omega X$ has the same edge group, up to\\nisomorphism. We show an isomorphism between the edge group of $\\\\Omega X$ and\\nthe combinatorial second homotopy group of $X$ as it has been defined in\\nseparate work (arxiv:2503.23651). Finally, we enter the topological setting\\nand, relying on prior work of Stone, show a homotopy equivalence between the\\nspatial realization of our $\\\\Omega X$ and the based loop space of the spatial\\nrealization of $X$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AT\", \"categories\": \"math.AT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:25:01Z\"}"}
