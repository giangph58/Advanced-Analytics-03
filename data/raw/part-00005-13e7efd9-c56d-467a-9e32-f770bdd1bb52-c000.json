These backgrounds are\\nconstructed by uplifting corresponding solutions in the $D=6$,\\n$\\\\mathcal{N}=(1,1)$ ungauged supergravity resulting from the compactification\\nof Type IIB supergravity on a $T^4/\\\\mathbb{Z}_2$-orientifold. More\\nspecifically, the supersymmetric solutions are ${\\\\rm WAdS}_3\\\\times {\\\\rm\\nWS}^3\\\\times T^4$ with lightlike warped AdS$_3$ and ${\\\\rm WAdS}_3\\\\times {\\\\rm\\nS}^3\\\\times T^4$ in which the warping of AdS$_3$ is generic. Moreover, we also\\nconstruct solutions in the form of a warped product\\n$\\\\mathrm{LM}^3_{\\\\zeta,\\\\omega}\\\\times_{{\\\\rm w}} \\\\mathrm{S}^3\\\\times T^4$ of a\\n2-parameter deformation $\\\\mathrm{LM}^3_{\\\\zeta,\\\\omega}$ of ${\\\\rm AdS}_3$ and a\\nthree-sphere. We discuss the relation of these backgrounds to known solutions.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:39:19Z\"}"}
