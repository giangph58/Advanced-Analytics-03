{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07410v1\", \"title\": \"Distributing graph states with a photon-weaving quantum server\", \"summary\": \"One of the key aims of quantum networks is the efficient distribution of\\nmultipartite entangled states among end users. While various architectures have\\nbeen proposed, each comes with distinct advantages and limitations. Many\\ndesigns depend on long-lived quantum memories and deterministic gates, which,\\nwhile powerful, introduce considerable cost and technical challenges.\\nExperimentally cheaper alternatives that circumvent these constraints are often\\nlimited to specific types of entanglement and a specific number of users. Here,\\nwe present an experiment-friendly quantum server that relies only on linear\\noptical elements, offering a flexible approach to multipartite entanglement\\ndistribution. Our so-called photon-weaving quantum server can generate and\\ndistribute one of several locally nonequivalent graph states, including\\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, as well as path, cycle, and\\ncaterpillar graph states. This is achieved through two distinct fusion\\nprotocols, i.e., multiphoton graph-state fusion (graph-state weaving) and\\nmultiphoton GHZ-state fusion (GHZ-state weaving), and can readily be\\nimplemented.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T03:03:14Z\"}"}
