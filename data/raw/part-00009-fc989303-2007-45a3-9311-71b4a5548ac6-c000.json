Traditional\\nmethods like linear-combination modeling are susceptible to ambiguities and\\ncommonly only provide a theoretical lower bound on estimation accuracy in the\\nform of the Cram\\\\'er-Rao bound. This work introduces a Bayesian inference\\nframework using Sylvester normalizing flows (SNFs) to approximate posterior\\ndistributions over metabolite concentrations, enhancing quantification\\nreliability. A physics-based decoder incorporates prior knowledge of MRS signal\\nformation, ensuring realistic distribution representations. We validate the\\nmethod on simulated 7T proton MRS data, demonstrating accurate metabolite\\nquantification, well-calibrated uncertainties, and insights into parameter\\ncorrelations and multi-modal distributions.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ML\", \"categories\": \"stat.ML,cs.LG,eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T14:50:14Z\"}"}
