{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03482v1\", \"title\": \"Learning-based Homothetic Tube MPC\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we study homothetic tube model predictive control (MPC) of\\ndiscrete-time linear systems subject to bounded additive disturbance and mixed\\nconstraints on the state and input. Different from most existing work on robust\\nMPC, we assume that the true disturbance set is unknown but a conservative\\nsurrogate is available a priori. Leveraging the real-time data, we develop an\\nonline learning algorithm to approximate the true disturbance set. This\\napproximation and the corresponding constraints in the MPC optimisation are\\nupdated online using computationally convenient linear programs. We provide\\nstatistical gaps between the true and learned disturbance sets, based on which,\\nprobabilistic recursive feasibility of homothetic tube MPC problems is\\ndiscussed. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of\\nour proposed algorithm and compare with state-of-the-art MPC algorithms.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T12:37:28Z\"}"}
