These counter-rotating oscillations can be of similar\\namplitude as the elementary femtosecond Rabi oscillations between the two\\nstrongly coupled states. The effect, which is beyond the two-level atom, is\\nnon-reciprocal: It only affects the excited state, while the ground state is\\nunaffected. We propose that two-photon Rabi oscillations (1s$^2$-1s3d) in\\nhelium is suitable for the generation of this type of ultrastrong coupling with\\nrealistic pulses. We use a combination of Floquet theory and effective\\nHamiltonian theory to test our predictions against ab initio simulations.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:01:32Z\"}"}
