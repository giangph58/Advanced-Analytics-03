{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02818v1\", \"title\": \"Universal Log-Optimality for General Classes of e-processes and\\n  Sequential Hypothesis Tests\", \"summary\": \"We consider the problem of sequential hypothesis testing by betting. For a\\ngeneral class of composite testing problems -- which include bounded mean\\ntesting, equal mean testing for bounded random tuples, and some key ingredients\\nof two-sample and independence testing as special cases -- we show that any\\n$e$-process satisfying a certain sublinear regret bound is adaptively,\\nasymptotically, and almost surely log-optimal for a composite alternative. This\\nis a strong notion of optimality that has not previously been established for\\nthe aforementioned problems and we provide explicit test supermartingales and\\n$e$-processes satisfying this notion in the more general case. Furthermore, we\\nderive matching lower and upper bounds on the expected rejection time for the\\nresulting sequential tests in all of these cases. The proofs of these results\\nmake weak, algorithm-agnostic moment assumptions and rely on a general-purpose\\nproof technique involving the aforementioned regret and a family of numeraire\\nportfolios. Finally, we discuss how all of these theorems hold in a\\ndistribution-uniform sense, a notion of log-optimality that is stronger still\\nand seems to be new to the literature.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.ME,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T17:58:10Z\"}"}
