{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11428v1\", \"title\": \"Probing the Quantum Geometry of Correlated Metals using Optical\\n  Conductivity\", \"summary\": \"Recent studies have revealed that the quantum geometry of electronic bands\\ndetermines the electromagnetic properties of non-interacting insulators and\\nsemimetals. However, the role of quantum geometry in the optical responses of\\ninteracting electron systems remains largely unexplored. Here we examine the\\ninterplay between Coulomb interactions and Bloch-band quantum geometry in clean\\nmetals. We demonstrate that the low-frequency optical conductivity of a\\ncorrelated metal encodes the structure of Bloch wave functions at the Fermi\\nsurface. This response originates from integrating out highly off-resonant\\ninterband scattering processes enabled by Coulomb interactions. The resulting\\nquantum-geometric contribution appears generically in multiband systems, but\\nbecomes the dominant effect in the optical conductivity for a parabolic band.\\nWe consider a dilute correlated metal near a topological band inversion and\\nshow that the doping dependence of optical absorption can measure how the\\norbital character of Bloch wave functions changes at the Fermi surface. Our\\nresults illustrate how the confluence of quantum geometry and Coulomb\\ninteractions can enable optical processes and enrich the physics of Fermi\\nliquids.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T17:39:13Z\"}"}
