Here, we theoretically study\\nantiferromagnetic domain-wall skyrmions and their current-driven motion within\\nthe Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert phenomenology, and verify our findings with\\nmicromagnetic simulations. While the skyrmion Hall effect is expected to be\\nsuppressed in the current-induced motion of antiferromagnetic domain-wall\\nskyrmions, we observe a finite Hall angle, which originates from the\\nanisotropic spin configuration of domain-wall skyrmions. The skyrmion Hall\\neffect is, however, conditionally suppressed and the motion aligns with the\\ncurrent applied in certain directions, which can be interpreted as principal\\naxes of a domain-wall skyrmion that is easily identified from the symmetry of\\nthe spin configuration. Our work on antiferromagnetic domain-wall skyrmions\\nshows that the dynamics of spin textures endowed with multiple soliton\\ncharacteristics can be unconventional, which is envisaged to enrich the field\\nof topological solitons.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T05:25:06Z\"}"}
