In this paper, we present a novel\\nmethodology that integrates a data-optimized framework with an advanced\\nacoustic model to build high-quality TTS systems for low-resource scenarios. We\\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using Thai as an illustrative\\ncase, where intricate phonetic rules and sparse resources are effectively\\naddressed. Our method enables zero-shot voice cloning and improved performance\\nacross diverse client applications, ranging from finance to healthcare,\\neducation, and law. Extensive evaluations - both subjective and objective -\\nconfirm that our model meets state-of-the-art standards, offering a scalable\\nsolution for TTS production in data-limited settings, with significant\\nimplications for broader industry adoption and multilingual accessibility.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SD\", \"categories\": \"cs.SD,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:32:57Z\"}"}
