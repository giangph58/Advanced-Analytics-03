Our approach follows the framework of\\nthe functional high dimensional data clustering (funHDDC) method, and we extend\\nto functional data the cluster weighted models based on skewed distributions\\nused for finite dimensional multivariate data. We consider several parsimonious\\nmodels, and to estimate the parameters we construct an expectation maximization\\n(EM) algorithm. We illustrate the performance of funWeightClustSkew for\\nsimulated data and for the Air Quality dataset.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,cs.LG,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T06:17:06Z\"}"}
