{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24357v1\", \"title\": \"InstructRestore: Region-Customized Image Restoration with Human\\n  Instructions\", \"summary\": \"Despite the significant progress in diffusion prior-based image restoration,\\nmost existing methods apply uniform processing to the entire image, lacking the\\ncapability to perform region-customized image restoration according to user\\ninstructions. In this work, we propose a new framework, namely InstructRestore,\\nto perform region-adjustable image restoration following human instructions. To\\nachieve this, we first develop a data generation engine to produce training\\ntriplets, each consisting of a high-quality image, the target region\\ndescription, and the corresponding region mask. With this engine and careful\\ndata screening, we construct a comprehensive dataset comprising 536,945\\ntriplets to support the training and evaluation of this task. We then examine\\nhow to integrate the low-quality image features under the ControlNet\\narchitecture to adjust the degree of image details enhancement. Consequently,\\nwe develop a ControlNet-like model to identify the target region and allocate\\ndifferent integration scales to the target and surrounding regions, enabling\\nregion-customized image restoration that aligns with user instructions.\\nExperimental results demonstrate that our proposed InstructRestore approach\\nenables effective human-instructed image restoration, such as images with bokeh\\neffects and user-instructed local enhancement. Our work advances the\\ninvestigation of interactive image restoration and enhancement techniques.\\nData, code, and models will be found at\\nhttps://github.com/shuaizhengliu/InstructRestore.git.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:36:05Z\"}"}
