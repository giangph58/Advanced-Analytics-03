The primary objective is to develop a network architecture capable of\\nachieving high-quality denoising performance, quantitatively evaluated using\\nPSNR, without constraints on computational complexity or model size. The task\\nassumes independent additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with a fixed noise\\nlevel of 50. A total of 290 participants registered for the challenge, with 20\\nteams successfully submitting valid results, providing insights into the\\ncurrent state-of-the-art in image denoising.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T17:35:09Z\"}"}
