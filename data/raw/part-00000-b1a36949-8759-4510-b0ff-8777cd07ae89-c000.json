We show why it is\\nunlikely these ``hostless'' supernovae stem from escaped hyper-velocity stars\\n(HVS) in any appreciable numbers, especially for core-collapse supernovae. It\\nis highly likely that hostless events arise from dwarf host galaxies too faint\\nto be detected in their parent surveys. Several detections and numerous upper\\nlimits suggest a large number of field dwarfs, to $M_V>-14$, which themselves\\nmay be important to constraining the slope of the low-mass end of the UV\\nluminosity function, understanding galaxy evolution, and putting $\\\\Lambda$CDM\\ninto context. Moreover, the detailed study of these mass and\\nmetallicity-constrained host environments, and the variety of supernovae that\\noccur within them, could provide more stringent constraints on the nature of\\nprogenitor systems.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:20:48Z\"}"}
