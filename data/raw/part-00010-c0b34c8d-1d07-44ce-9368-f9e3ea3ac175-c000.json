More than a hundred people attended the meeting, with about half of\\nthe attendees being external delegates and coming from as far afield as the USA\\nand South Africa. Tom Marsh moved to the University of Warwick from Southampton\\nin 2003, after the Department of Physics decided to expand the scope of its\\nresearch. From its humble beginnings with only two staff members, Tom himself\\nand Boris G\\\\\\\"ansicke, one postdoc and a couple of PhD students, the group has\\nnow grown to more than 95 members, including 25 staff. Tom pioneered the\\ndevelopment of Doppler tomography, led key discoveries in the field of\\ndouble-degenerate binary systems and made extensive contributions to\\ninstrumentation, primarily to developing the high-speed imaging photometers\\nULTRACAM, ULTRASPEC and HiPERCAM. This article provides a summary of Tom's\\nlegacy and Warwick's history as presented in the 21 years of Astronomy at\\nWarwick meeting.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:25:07Z\"}"}
