We are interested in the link\\nbetween the limit problem, as $\\\\epsilon$ $\\\\rightarrow$ 0, and some optimal\\ncontrol problems on networks studied in the literature. We prove that the\\nsequence of trajectories admits a subsequential limit evolving on $\\\\Gamma$.\\nMoreover, in the case of the Eikonal equation, we show that the sequence of\\nvalue functions associated with the perturbed optimal control problems\\nconverges to a limit which, in particular, coincides with the value function of\\nthe expected optimal control problem set on the network $\\\\Gamma$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T08:00:07Z\"}"}
