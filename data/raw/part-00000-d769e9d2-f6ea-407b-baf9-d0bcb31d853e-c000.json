{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21674v1\", \"title\": \"Intelligent IoT Attack Detection Design via ODLLM with Feature\\n  Ranking-based Knowledge Base\", \"summary\": \"The widespread adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has introduced\\nsignificant cybersecurity challenges, particularly with the increasing\\nfrequency and sophistication of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.\\nTraditional machine learning (ML) techniques often fall short in detecting such\\nattacks due to the complexity of blended and evolving patterns. To address\\nthis, we propose a novel framework leveraging On-Device Large Language Models\\n(ODLLMs) augmented with fine-tuning and knowledge base (KB) integration for\\nintelligent IoT network attack detection. By implementing feature ranking\\ntechniques and constructing both long and short KBs tailored to model\\ncapacities, the proposed framework ensures efficient and accurate detection of\\nDDoS attacks while overcoming computational and privacy limitations. Simulation\\nresults demonstrate that the optimized framework achieves superior accuracy\\nacross diverse attack types, especially when using compact models in edge\\ncomputing environments. This work provides a scalable and secure solution for\\nreal-time IoT security, advancing the applicability of edge intelligence in\\ncybersecurity.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.AI,cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T16:41:57Z\"}"}
