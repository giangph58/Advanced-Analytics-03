We present a\\ndetailed spectro-polarimetric study of the source using data from both\\nsatellites covering the period from March 7-10, 2025. A polarimetric analysis\\nin the $2$-$8$~keV band using a model-independent method reveals a significant\\ndetection of polarization degree (PD) of $(11.3\\\\pm2.35)\\\\%$ at a polarization\\nangle (PA) of $82^\\\\circ.7\\\\pm5^\\\\circ.96$ (significant at $>4\\\\sigma$). The\\nmodel-dependent polarization analysis using the polconst and polpow models\\nyields consistent values of PD and PA. In both methods, an energy-dependent\\nincreasing trend of PD is observed. In the $6$-$8$~keV band, a maximum PD of\\n$(29.9\\\\pm8.46)\\\\%$ is detected at a PA of $88^\\\\circ.0\\\\pm8^\\\\circ.15$ (significant\\nat $>3\\\\sigma$) . The joint spectral analysis using IXPE and NuSTAR data in the\\n$2$-$70$~keV band was performed with four different sets of phenomenological\\nand physical models. Our results indicate a strong dominance of non-thermal\\nphotons originating from a `hot' Compton cloud, suggesting that the source was\\nin a hard spectral state. Spectral fitting with the physical kerrbb and TCAF\\nmodels provides an estimate of the black hole mass $M_{\\\\rm BH} =\\n14.8^{+4.7}_{-3.4}~M_\\\\odot$ and dimensionless spin parameter $a^* \\\\sim 0.54$.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T04:11:16Z\"}"}
