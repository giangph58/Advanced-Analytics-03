{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21355v1\", \"title\": \"From fluttering to drifting in inertialess sedimentation of achiral\\n  particles\", \"summary\": \"There has been much recent interest in the chiral motion of achiral particles\\nthat sediment in a viscous fluid in a regime where inertial effects can be\\nneglected. This occurs in a broad range of applications such as those involving\\nbiological objects like algae, ultra-thin graphene flakes, or colloidal\\nsuspensions. It is known that articles with two planes of symmetry can be\\ncategorised as ``settlers'', ``drifters'' or ``flutterers'', where the latter\\nsediment along chiral trajectories despite their achiral shapes. Here we\\nanalyse the sedimentation of circular disks bent into a U-shape\\n(``flutterers'') and show how their behaviour changes when we break one of\\ntheir symmetries by pinching the disks along their axis. The ``fluttering''\\nbehaviour is found to be robust to such shape changes, with the trajectories\\nnow evolving towards helical paths. However, the behaviour changes when the\\ndegree of pinching becomes too strong, at which point the particles become\\n``drifters'' which sediment steadily without rotation. We establish criteria\\nfor the transition between the two types of behaviour and confirm our\\npredictions in experiments. Finally, we discuss the implications of our\\nobservations for the dispersion of dilute suspensions made of such particles.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T06:21:12Z\"}"}
