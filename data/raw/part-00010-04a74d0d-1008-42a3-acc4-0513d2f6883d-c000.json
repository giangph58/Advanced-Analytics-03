This study utilized 3.356 GeV\\nelectrons scattered off targets including $^2$H, $^3$He, $^4$He, $^{12}$C,\\n$^{40}$Ca, and $^{48}$Ca, at modest momentum transfers ($1.3 < Q^2 \\\\leq 2$\\nGeV$^2$). Kinematics were selected to enhance the cross-section contribution\\nfrom high-momentum nucleons originating from the strongly interacting,\\nshort-distance components of two-nucleon SRCs (2N-SRCs), known to exhibit a\\nuniversal structure across both light and heavy nuclei.We analyzed the A/$^2$H\\nratio within the region dominated by 2N-SRCs to characterize the nuclear\\ndependence of SRC contributions across various nuclei. Additionally, the\\nA/$^3$He ratio was examined at kinematics sensitive to nucleons with even\\nhigher momentum, aiming to identify signals indicative of three-nucleon SRCs\\n(3N-SRCs). The traditional analysis method in the expected 3N-SRC region ($x >\\n2$) did not yield a clear plateau; instead, the data diverged from the\\npredicted 3N-SRC behavior as momentum transfer increased. However, when\\nanalyzed in terms of the struck nucleon's light-cone momentum, the data\\nexhibited the opposite trend, progressively approaching the predicted 3N-SRC\\nplateau. These observations suggest that future measurements at higher energies\\nmay facilitate a definitive isolation and identification of 3N-SRCs.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-ex\", \"categories\": \"nucl-ex,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T11:53:43Z\"}"}
