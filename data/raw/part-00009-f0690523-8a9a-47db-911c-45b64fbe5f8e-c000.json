When in orbit around the center of a star, which can possibly be a\\ncompletely interior orbit, such objects would emit gravitational waves, as\\npredicted by general relativity. In this work, we examine the gravitational\\nwave signals emitted by such objects when they orbit typical stars, such as the\\nSun. We show that the magnitude of the waves that could eventually be detected\\non Earth from a possible PBH orbiting the Sun or a neighboring Sun-like star\\nwithin our galaxy can be significantly stronger than those originating from a\\nPBH orbiting a denser but more distant neutron star (NS). Such signals may be\\ndetectable by the LISA gravitational-wave detector. In addition, we estimate\\nthe contribution that a large collection of such PBH-star systems would make to\\nthe stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) within a range of\\nfrequencies to which pulsar timing arrays are sensitive.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T07:25:26Z\"}"}
