We define bias as a\\nmodel's unfair deviation from population statistics given neutral prompts. Our\\nexperiments with Stable Diffusion XL, 3.5 and Flux demonstrate that\\nLLM-modified prompts significantly increase image diversity and reduce bias\\nwithout the need to change the image generators themselves. While occasionally\\nproducing results that diverge from original user intent for elaborate prompts,\\nthis approach generally provides more varied interpretations of underspecified\\nrequests rather than superficial variations. The method works particularly well\\nfor less advanced image generators, though limitations persist for certain\\ncontexts like disability representation. All prompts and generated images are\\navailable at https://iisys-hof.github.io/llm-prompt-img-gen/\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.CV,cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T11:52:20Z\"}"}
