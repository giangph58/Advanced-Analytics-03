On the Effect of the Truncation Frequency\\n  in Multi-Objective Optimisation\", \"summary\": \"Using an archive to store nondominated solutions found during the search of a\\nmulti-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is a useful practice. However, as\\nnondominated solutions of a multi-objective optimisation problem can be\\nenormous or infinitely many, it is desirable to provide the decision-maker with\\nonly a small, representative portion of all the nondominated solutions in the\\narchive, thus entailing a truncation operation. Then, an important issue is\\nwhen to truncate the archive. This can be done once a new solution generated, a\\nbatch of new solutions generated, or even using an unbounded archive to keep\\nall nondominated solutions generated and truncate it later. Intuitively, the\\nlast approach may lead to a better result since we have all the information in\\nhand before performing the truncation. In this paper, we study this issue and\\ninvestigate the effect of the timing of truncating the archive. We apply\\nwell-established truncation criteria that are commonly used in the population\\nmaintenance procedure of MOEAs (e.g., crowding distance, hypervolume indicator,\\nand decomposition). We show that, interestingly, truncating the archive once a\\nnew solution generated tends to be the best, whereas considering an unbounded\\narchive is often the worst. We analyse and discuss this phenomenon. Our results\\nhighlight the importance of developing effective subset selection techniques\\n(rather than employing the population maintenance methods in MOEAs) when using\\na large archive.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NE\", \"categories\": \"cs.NE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T03:33:49Z\"}"}
