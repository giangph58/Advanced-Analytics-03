{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10831v1\", \"title\": \"Hallucination-Aware Generative Pretrained Transformer for Cooperative\\n  Aerial Mobility Control\", \"summary\": \"This paper proposes SafeGPT, a two-tiered framework that integrates\\ngenerative pretrained transformers (GPTs) with reinforcement learning (RL) for\\nefficient and reliable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) last-mile deliveries. In\\nthe proposed design, a Global GPT module assigns high-level tasks such as\\nsector allocation, while an On-Device GPT manages real-time local route\\nplanning. An RL-based safety filter monitors each GPT decision and overrides\\nunsafe actions that could lead to battery depletion or duplicate visits,\\neffectively mitigating hallucinations. Furthermore, a dual replay buffer\\nmechanism helps both the GPT modules and the RL agent refine their strategies\\nover time. Simulation results demonstrate that SafeGPT achieves higher delivery\\nsuccess rates compared to a GPT-only baseline, while substantially reducing\\nbattery consumption and travel distance. These findings validate the efficacy\\nof combining GPT-based semantic reasoning with formal safety guarantees,\\ncontributing a viable solution for robust and energy-efficient UAV logistics.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T03:21:08Z\"}"}
