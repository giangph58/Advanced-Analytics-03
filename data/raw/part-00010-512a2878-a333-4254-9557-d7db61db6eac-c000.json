{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21407v1\", \"title\": \"Modelling the error structure in Urban Building Energy Models with a\\n  Gaussian Processbased approach\", \"summary\": \"Urban Building Energy Models (UBEM) support urbanscale energy decisions and\\nhave recently been applied to use cases requiring dynamic outputs like grid\\nmanagement. However, their predictive capability remains insufficiently\\naddressed, limiting confidence in UBEM application when validation experiments\\n(VE) are unavailable. This study proposes a Gaussian Process (GP)-based method\\nto model the error structure of UBEM, involving: (1) creating a training\\ndataset mapping VE conditions to validation errors, (2) fitting a GP model, and\\n(3) using cross-validation to assess prediction accuracy and uncertainty while\\nextrapolating to unknown scenarios. Applied to the Blagnac (France) district\\nheating network with the UBEM DIMOSIM, GP models effectively capture the\\ninherent structure of UBEM error and uncertainties. Results reveal\\nrelationships between model performance and application conditions (e.g., load\\nvariation and weather), and show great potential in estimating within-domain\\nmodel error and extrapolating beyond the validation domain. Key Innovations:\\n$\\\\bullet$ Use GP based approach to quantify the error structure of a UBEM,\\n$\\\\bullet$ Extrapolate the UBEM predictive capability to unvalidated buildings,\\n$\\\\bullet$ Discover different interaction patterns between validation experiment\\n(VE) conditions and UBEM performance. Practical Implications:This paper allows\\nUBEM developpers to have a more comprehensive view of UBEM performance, and\\nhelps practionners to prioritise measurement campaigns and to better design\\nfurther validation experiments.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T08:08:19Z\"}"}
