An approximation is presented\\nto provide an analytic estimate of a Laplacian eigenvalue and complements\\nbounds on Laplacian eigenvalues in spectral graph theory. Then, we apply the\\nEuler summation and numerically analyze how the structure of graphs influences\\nthe convergence of the corresponding Euler series. Moreover, we obtain the\\nexplicit form of the perturbation Taylor series and its Euler series of almost\\nregular graphs in which only one node has a unique degree and all remaining\\nnodes have the same degree. We find that the Euler series possesses a superior\\nconvergence range than the perturbation Taylor series for almost regular\\ngraphs.\", \"main_category\": \"math.SP\", \"categories\": \"math.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T09:17:18Z\"}"}
