While\\nODEs offer interpretability and simplicity, SDEs incorporate randomness,\\nproviding robustness to noise and model misspecifications. Recent research\\nhighlights the statistical advantages of SDEs, such as improved parameter\\nidentifiability and stability under perturbations. This paper investigates the\\nrobustness of parameter estimation in SDEs versus ODEs under three types of\\nmodel misspecifications: unrecognized noise sources, external perturbations,\\nand simplified models. Furthermore, the effect of missing data is explored.\\nThrough simulations and an analysis of Danish COVID-19 data, we demonstrate\\nthat SDEs yield more stable and reliable parameter estimates, making them a\\nstrong alternative to traditional ODE modeling in the presence of uncertainty.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,stat.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T12:46:04Z\"}"}
