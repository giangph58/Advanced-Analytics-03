The electromagnetic response of graphene coating characterized by\\nthe nonzero energy gap and chemical potential is described in the framework of\\nthe Dirac model by means of the polarization tensor. It is shown that the\\nmagnitude of the nonequilibrium Casimir pressure on a warmer plate than the\\nenvironment is larger and on a cooler plate is smaller than the magnitude of\\nthe standard Casimir pressure in the state of thermal equilibrium. According to\\nour results, the spatially local theory underestimates the role of the effects\\nof nonequilibrium. This underestimation increases for asmaller chemical\\npotential of the graphene coating and at lower temperatures of the cooled\\nplate. Possible applications of the obtained results are discussed.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T09:04:09Z\"}"}
