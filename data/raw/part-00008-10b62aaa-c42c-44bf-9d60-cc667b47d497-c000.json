Two-dimensional materials, particularly\\nhexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), have attracted significant attention due to\\ntheir exceptional mechanical, thermal, and electronic properties. However, the\\ninfluence of functionalization on the thermal expansion behavior remains\\nlargely unexplored. In this work, DFT calculations are employed to analyze how\\ndifferent functionalized forms of h-BN impact the thermal expansion of BN\\nsheets. Density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) and the quasiharmonic\\napproximation (QAH) are utilized to determine the thermal expansion coefficient\\nover a range of temperatures. The results reveal that functionalization induces\\nnotable modifications in the in-plane thermal expansion of BN, affecting\\nmaterial stability and suggesting potential applications in nanoelectronics and\\nthermal management. This investigation provides critical insights into the\\ntunability of the thermal properties of 2D BN, underscoring its suitability for\\nnext-generation flexible and high-performance devices.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T05:35:18Z\"}"}
