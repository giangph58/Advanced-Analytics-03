We utilize graphon limits to encode\\nthe evolution of independence and characterize the limiting distribution. Our\\nframework subsumes a wide class of dependency structures and includes, as a\\nspecial case, a CLT for higher-order tensor products of free random variables.\\nOur results extend earlier findings and recover as a special case a recent\\ntensor-free CLT, which was obtained through the development of a tensor\\nanalogue of free probability. In contrast, our approach is more direct and\\nprovides a unified and concise derivation of a more general CLT via graphon\\nconvergence.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T10:02:14Z\"}"}
