In this work,\\nwe examine the LHC sensitivity to weak gauginos in light of the latest\\nconstraints from the muon $g-2$ anomaly and dark matter (DM) observations. To\\nsimultaneously account for the observed $5\\\\sigma$ deviation in muon $g-2$ and\\nthe correct DM relic abundance, the DM candidate in the MSSM must be bino-like:\\nwino- or higgsino-like neutralinos require TeV-scale masses to avoid\\nunderabundance, rendering the electroweakino spectrum too heavy to yield a\\nsizable $g-2$ contribution. Moreover, tight direct detection limits disfavor\\nlight higgsinos, which can induce sizable DM-nucleon scattering via\\nbino-higgsino mixing. We thus focus on scenarios with a bino-like LSP and\\nrelatively heavy higgsinos. Two classes of wino spectra are considered: a\\nlight-wino scenario (LWo) with $m_{\\\\tilde{W}} \\\\lesssim 1$~TeV, and a heavy-wino\\nscenario (HWo) with $m_{\\\\tilde{W}} \\\\gtrsim 1$~TeV. For each, we delineate the\\nviable parameter space under current constraints and assess the discovery\\npotential at future LHC stages. We find that while the high-luminosity LHC\\n(HL-LHC) can probe a portion of the parameter space, the high-energy 27~TeV LHC\\n(HE-LHC) is capable of covering most of it.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T17:50:27Z\"}"}
