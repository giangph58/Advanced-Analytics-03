It is a critical cognitive function that enables humans to perform\\nvarious online processing tasks, such as dialing a phone number, recalling\\nmisplaced items' locations, or navigating through a store. However, inherent\\nlimitations in an individual's capacity to retain information often result in\\nforgetting important details during such tasks. Although previous research has\\nsuccessfully utilized wearable and assistive technologies to enhance long-term\\nmemory functions (e.g., episodic memory), their application to supporting\\nshort-term recall in daily activities remains underexplored. To address this\\ngap, we present Memento, a framework that uses multimodal wearable sensor data\\nto detect significant changes in cognitive state and provide intelligent in\\nsitu cues to enhance recall. Through two user studies involving 15 and 25\\nparticipants in visual search navigation tasks, we demonstrate that\\nparticipants receiving visual cues from Memento achieved significantly better\\nroute recall, improving approximately 20-23% compared to free recall.\\nFurthermore, Memento reduced cognitive load and review time by 46% while also\\nsubstantially reducing computation time (3.86 seconds vs. 15.35 seconds),\\noffering an average of 75% effectiveness compared to computer vision-based cue\\nselection approaches.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.MM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T13:17:59Z\"}"}
