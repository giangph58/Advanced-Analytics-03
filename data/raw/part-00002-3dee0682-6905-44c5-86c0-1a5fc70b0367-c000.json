{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00290v1\", \"title\": \"Multi-Hierarchical Fine-Grained Feature Mapping Driven by Feature\\n  Contribution for Molecular Odor Prediction\", \"summary\": \"Molecular odor prediction is the process of using a molecule's structure to\\npredict its smell. While accurate prediction remains challenging, AI models can\\nsuggest potential odors. Existing methods, however, often rely on basic\\ndescriptors or handcrafted fingerprints, which lack expressive power and hinder\\neffective learning. Furthermore, these methods suffer from severe class\\nimbalance, limiting the training effectiveness of AI models. To address these\\nchallenges, we propose a Feature Contribution-driven Hierarchical Multi-Feature\\nMapping Network (HMFNet). Specifically, we introduce a fine-grained, Local\\nMulti-Hierarchy Feature Extraction module (LMFE) that performs deep feature\\nextraction at the atomic level, capturing detailed features crucial for odor\\nprediction. To enhance the extraction of discriminative atomic features, we\\nintegrate a Harmonic Modulated Feature Mapping (HMFM). This module dynamically\\nlearns feature importance and frequency modulation, improving the model's\\ncapability to capture relevant patterns. Additionally, a Global Multi-Hierarchy\\nFeature Extraction module (GMFE) is designed to learn global features from the\\nmolecular graph topology, enabling the model to fully leverage global\\ninformation and enhance its discriminative power for odor prediction. To\\nfurther mitigate the issue of class imbalance, we propose a Chemically-Informed\\nLoss (CIL). Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly\\nimproves performance across various deep learning models, highlighting its\\npotential to advance molecular structure representation and accelerate the\\ndevelopment of AI-driven technologies.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T04:26:31Z\"}"}
