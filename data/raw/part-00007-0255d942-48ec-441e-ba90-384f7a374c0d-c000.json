If $\\\\theta>0$ and if the step size $h>0$ is\\narbitrarily fixed, we derive Berry-Ess\\\\'{e}en bound for the ergodic type\\nestimator (or say the moment estimator) $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_n$, i.e., the Kolmogorov\\ndistance between the distribution of $\\\\sqrt{n}(\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_n-\\\\theta)$ and its\\nlimit distribution is bounded by a constant $C_{\\\\theta, H,h}$ times\\n$n^{-\\\\frac12}$ and $ n^{4H-3}$ when $H\\\\in (0,\\\\,\\\\frac58]$ and $H\\\\in\\n(\\\\frac58,\\\\,\\\\frac34)$, respectively. This result greatly improve the previous\\nresult in literature where $h$ is forced to go zero. Moreover, we extend the\\nBerry-Esseen bound to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model driven by a lot of Gaussian\\nnoises such as the sub-bifractional Brownian motion and others. A few ideas of\\nthe present paper come from Haress and Hu (2021), Sottinen and Viitasaari\\n(2018), and Chen and Zhou (2021).\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T11:01:35Z\"}"}
