{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12654v1\", \"title\": \"The Paradox of Professional Input: How Expert Collaboration with AI\\n  Systems Shapes Their Future Value\", \"summary\": \"This perspective paper examines a fundamental paradox in the relationship\\nbetween professional expertise and artificial intelligence: as domain experts\\nincreasingly collaborate with AI systems by externalizing their implicit\\nknowledge, they potentially accelerate the automation of their own expertise.\\nThrough analysis of multiple professional contexts, we identify emerging\\npatterns in human-AI collaboration and propose frameworks for professionals to\\nnavigate this evolving landscape. Drawing on research in knowledge management,\\nexpertise studies, human-computer interaction, and labor economics, we develop\\na nuanced understanding of how professional value may be preserved and\\ntransformed in an era of increasingly capable AI systems. Our analysis suggests\\nthat while the externalization of tacit knowledge presents certain risks to\\ntraditional professional roles, it also creates opportunities for the evolution\\nof expertise and the emergence of new forms of professional value. We conclude\\nwith implications for professional education, organizational design, and policy\\ndevelopment that can help ensure the codification of expert knowledge enhances\\nrather than diminishes the value of human expertise.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T05:32:21Z\"}"}
