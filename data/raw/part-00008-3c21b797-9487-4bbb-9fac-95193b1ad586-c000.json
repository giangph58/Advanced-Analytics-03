As a consequence, we show that bi-orderability is not a profinite\\nproperty. This answers negatively the question of Piwek and Wykowski in the\\nproblem list that came from participants of the workshop ``Profinite Rigidity\\\"\\nheld in Madrid from June 26 to June 30, 2023. Moreover, the proof can be\\napplied to show that the existence of a generalized torsion element is not a\\nprofinite property.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GR\", \"categories\": \"math.GR,math.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T06:22:06Z\"}"}
