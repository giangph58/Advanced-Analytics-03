Using the Russian-Ukrainian and Israeli-Palestinian\\nconflicts as case studies, the platform integrates four analytical methods:\\npropagation analysis, trend analysis, sentiment analysis, and temporal topic\\nmodeling. Over 350,000 articles were collected and analyzed, with a focus on\\neconomic disparities and geographical influences using metadata enrichment. We\\nevaluate the case studies using coherence, sentiment polarity, topic frequency,\\nand trend shifts as key metrics. Our results show distinct patterns in news\\ncoverage: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict tends to have more negative\\nsentiment with a focus on human rights, while the Russia-Ukraine conflict is\\nmore positive, emphasizing election interference. These findings highlight the\\ninfluence of political, economic, and regional factors in shaping media\\nnarratives across different conflicts.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:36:55Z\"}"}
