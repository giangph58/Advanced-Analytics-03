Elucidating the underlying\\nmechanism behind the CDW transition is crucial for unraveling the complex\\ninteractions among these phases. However, the driving force of the CDW remains\\na topic of debate due to the intertwined interactions among the system's\\nvarious excitations. Here we investigated the CDW transition in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ by\\nisolating the ultrafast electronic phase transition using time- and\\nangleresolved photoemission spectroscopy. An ultrafast electronic phase\\ntransition was observed at a critical photoexcitation fluence, Fc, without\\nreduction in CDW lattice-distortion-induced band folding. This folded band\\npersisted up to 150 K under equilibrium heating, well above the CDW\\ncondensation temperature of Tc = 78 K. Notably, the pump-induced band shifts at\\nFc were comparable to those caused by thermal effects at Tc. These findings\\nsuggest that in KV$_3$Sb$_5$, a fluctuating lattice-driven in-plane CDW emerges\\nabove 150 K, with out-of-plane electronic correlations leading to the $2\\\\times2\\n\\\\times 2$ CDW near Tc, offering key insights into the interplay between the\\nelectronic and structural dynamics in AV$_3$Sb$_5$.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T11:18:34Z\"}"}
