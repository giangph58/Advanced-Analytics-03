{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05846v1\", \"title\": \"PathGPT: Leveraging Large Language Models for Personalized Route\\n  Generation\", \"summary\": \"The proliferation of GPS enabled devices has led to the accumulation of a\\nsubstantial corpus of historical trajectory data. By leveraging these data for\\ntraining machine learning models,researchers have devised novel data-driven\\nmethodologies that address the personalized route recommendation (PRR) problem.\\nIn contrast to conventional algorithms such as Dijkstra shortest path\\nalgorithm,these novel algorithms possess the capacity to discern and learn\\npatterns within the data,thereby facilitating the generation of more\\npersonalized paths. However,once these models have been trained,their\\napplication is constrained to the generation of routes that align with their\\ntraining patterns. This limitation renders them less adaptable to novel\\nscenarios and the deployment of multiple machine learning models might be\\nnecessary to address new possible scenarios,which can be costly as each model\\nmust be trained separately. Inspired by recent advances in the field of Large\\nLanguage Models (LLMs),we leveraged their natural language understanding\\ncapabilities to develop a unified model to solve the PRR problem while being\\nseamlessly adaptable to new scenarios without additional training. To\\naccomplish this,we combined the extensive knowledge LLMs acquired during\\ntraining with further access to external hand-crafted context\\ninformation,similar to RAG (Retrieved Augmented Generation) systems,to enhance\\ntheir ability to generate paths according to user-defined requirements.\\nExtensive experiments on different datasets show a considerable uplift in LLM\\nperformance on the PRR problem.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:25:21Z\"}"}
