In this work, a simulation model is established to\\nquantify the trajectory of a single particle moving close to a polymer surface\\nin a quiescent liquid. The simulations include hydrodynamic, magnetostatic, and\\nDerjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) interactions. They are applied to\\nparticle motion driven by a dynamically changing magnetic field landscape\\ncreated by engineered parallel-stripe magnetic domains superposed by a\\nhomogeneous, time-varying external magnetic field. The simulation model is\\nadapted to experiments in terms of fluid-particle interactions with the\\nmagnetic field landscape approximated by analytic equations under the\\nassumption of surface charges. Varying simulation parameters, we especially\\nclarify the impact of liquid-mediated DLVO interactions, which are essential\\nfor diagnostic applications, on the 3D trajectory of the particle. A comparison\\nto experimental results validates our simulation approach.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn,physics.app-ph,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T08:14:16Z\"}"}
