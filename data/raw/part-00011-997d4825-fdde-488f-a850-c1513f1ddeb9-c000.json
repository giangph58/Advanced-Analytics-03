Insights in the prevalence of\\ncarsickness and its modulating factors are considered useful for the\\ndevelopment of automated vehicles to mitigate or prevent its occurrence. An\\nonline survey was conducted with N = 3999 participants in Spain, Sweden,\\nPoland, and Germany. 30% of participants reported to have already experienced\\ncarsickness as adult. The frequency of carsickness was modulated not only by\\ndemographic factors (country, gender, age), but also by frequency of being a\\npassenger, type of non-driving related task, road type, and the seating\\nposition in car. Furthermore, the efficiency of applied countermeasures,\\ntemporal aspects of carsickness development, as well as the relation of\\ncarsickness with the acceptability of automated driving and the effect on\\nsubjective fitness to drive was investigated. The results are discussed with\\nfocus on automated driving.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:04:33Z\"}"}
