As an application, we show that every irreducible right-angled\\nCoxeter group of rank $N \\\\geq 3$ virtually embeds Zariski-densely in\\n$\\\\mathrm{SL}_n(\\\\mathbb{Z})$ for all $n \\\\geq N$. This allows us to settle the\\nexistence of Zariski-dense surface subgroups of $\\\\mathrm{SL}_n(\\\\mathbb{Z})$ for\\nall $n \\\\geq 3$. Among the other applications are examples of Zariski-dense\\none-ended finitely generated subgroups of $\\\\mathrm{SL}_n(\\\\mathbb{Z})$ that are\\nnot finitely presented for all $n \\\\geq 6$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GT\", \"categories\": \"math.GT,math.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:46:55Z\"}"}
