{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11872v1\", \"title\": \"A Category-Fragment Segmentation Framework for Pelvic Fracture\\n  Segmentation in X-ray Images\", \"summary\": \"Pelvic fractures, often caused by high-impact trauma, frequently require\\nsurgical intervention. Imaging techniques such as CT and 2D X-ray imaging are\\nused to transfer the surgical plan to the operating room through image\\nregistration, enabling quick intraoperative adjustments. Specifically,\\nsegmenting pelvic fractures from 2D X-ray imaging can assist in accurately\\npositioning bone fragments and guiding the placement of screws or metal plates.\\nIn this study, we propose a novel deep learning-based category and fragment\\nsegmentation (CFS) framework for the automatic segmentation of pelvic bone\\nfragments in 2D X-ray images. The framework consists of three consecutive\\nsteps: category segmentation, fragment segmentation, and post-processing. Our\\nbest model achieves an IoU of 0.91 for anatomical structures and 0.78 for\\nfracture segmentation. Results demonstrate that the CFS framework is effective\\nand accurate.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T08:49:22Z\"}"}
