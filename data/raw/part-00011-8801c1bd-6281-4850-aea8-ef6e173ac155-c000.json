The interaction between the\\nantenna and the layered medium is modeled through spherical-to-planar vector\\nwave transformations, ensuring no approximations that could compromise\\ncomputational accuracy. This theoretical framework significantly reduces\\nalgebraic complexity, resulting in a marked increase in the speed of antenna\\nperformance evaluation. Excluding the one-time preprocessing cost of obtaining\\nthe antenna's GSM in free space, the numerical evaluation speed of this method\\nexceeds that of the commercial software FEKO by several orders of magnitude,\\nwhile maintaining nearly identical accuracy.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CE\", \"categories\": \"cs.CE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T03:28:23Z\"}"}
