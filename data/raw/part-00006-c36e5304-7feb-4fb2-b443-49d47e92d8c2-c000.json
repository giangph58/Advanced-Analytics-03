In addition to the development of new\\ninstruments, advancements in post-processing algorithms can enhance the\\nperformances attainable in an observation, turning archival observations into a\\ntreasure. We developed a machine-learning tool, named zoom-in, that is able to\\nimprove the angular resolution of an astronomical image by a factor of $\\\\sim\\n100$ by optimally recombining short-cadence sequences of images. After training\\nour model on real-life photographs, we tested our method on archival images of\\nthe Moon taken through ESO instruments. We were able to achieve a remarkable\\nspatial resolution of $\\\\sim 1$ m of the lunar surface. While analyzing one of\\nthe fields from the sample, we discovered structures of clear anthropic origin\\ninside the Aristarchus crater. The features appear to be consistent with\\nancient ruins of cities and castles. A thorough analysis of the relevant\\nliterature allowed us to conclude that this valley corresponds to the one\\ndescribed in Ludovico Ariosto's \\\"Orlando Furioso\\\": a place where all the items\\nlost by humans gather and pile up. Analyses of the surface brightness from our\\nimages, indicating an abnormally high albedo of $\\\\sim 0.25$, further\\ncorroborate this idea suggesting a conspicuous presence of glass. We infer the\\npresence of >1 billion flasks of human wits on the lunar surface, whose origin\\nwe investigate in detail. We urge for a dedicated mission, astolfo, to be\\ncarried out by Artemis astronauts in order to recover human wits and bring them\\nback to the Earth.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:54:30Z\"}"}
