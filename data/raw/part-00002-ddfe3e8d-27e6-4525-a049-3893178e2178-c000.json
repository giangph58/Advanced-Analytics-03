It\\nprovides an exact solution that is compatible with the latest observational\\nconstraints and offers a natural framework for enhancing the curvature power\\nspectrum, which is relevant to the formation of primordial black holes. In this\\npaper, I review constant-roll inflation in memory of Alexei Starobinsky.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T14:30:06Z\"}"}
