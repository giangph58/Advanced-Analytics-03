Accelerators for cancer treatment can serve as such a\\ntesting ground. However, HEP instrument tests typically require particle fluxes\\nsignificantly lower than for cancer treatment. Thus, facilities need\\nadaptations to fulfill both the requirements for cancer treatment and the\\nrequirements for HEP instrument testing. We report on the progress made in\\ndeveloping a beam monitor with a sufficient dynamic range to allow for the\\ndetection of single particles, while still being able to act as a monitor at\\nthe clinical particle rates of the MedAustron treatment facility. The beam\\nmonitor is designed for integration into existing accelerators.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.acc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.acc-ph,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T12:00:09Z\"}"}
