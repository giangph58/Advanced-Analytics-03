In this paper, by\\ndeveloping a trichotomy for sparse graphs, we show that for given integers\\n$m\\\\ge 2$ and $t\\\\ge 1$, there exists a positive constant $c$ such that if $1\\\\le\\nk\\\\le cn^{\\\\frac{2}{m-1}}$ and $n$ is large, then $G$ is $tK_m$-good, that is,\\nthe Ramsey number is \\\\[ r(G, tK_m)=(n-1)(m-1)+t\\\\,. \\\\] In particular, the above\\nequality holds for any positive integers $k$, $m$, and $t$, provided $n$ is\\nlarge. The case $t=1$ was obtained by Burr, Erd\\\\H{o}s, Faudree, Rousseau, and\\nSchelp (1980), and the case $k=1$ was established by Luo and Peng (2023).\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T05:46:43Z\"}"}
