{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03414v1\", \"title\": \"Enhancing Target-unspecific Tasks through a Features Matrix\", \"summary\": \"Recent developments in prompt learning of large vision-language models have\\nsignificantly improved performance in target-specific tasks. However, these\\nprompt optimizing methods often struggle to tackle the target-unspecific or\\ngeneralizable tasks effectively. It may be attributed to the fact that\\noverfitting training causes the model to forget its general knowledge having\\nstrong promotion on target-unspecific tasks. To alleviate this issue, we\\npropose a novel Features Matrix (FM) regularization approach designed to\\nenhance these models on target-unspecific tasks. Our method extracts and\\nleverages general knowledge, shaping a Features Matrix (FM). Specifically, the\\nFM captures the semantics of diverse inputs from a deep and fine perspective,\\npreserving essential general knowledge, which mitigates the risk of\\noverfitting. Representative evaluations demonstrate that: 1) the FM is\\ncompatible with existing frameworks as a generic and flexible module, and 2)\\nthe FM significantly showcases its effectiveness in enhancing target-unspecific\\ntasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T10:41:53Z\"}"}
