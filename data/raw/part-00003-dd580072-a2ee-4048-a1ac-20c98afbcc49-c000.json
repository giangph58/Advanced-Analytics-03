Am. Chem. Soc. 2023, 145, 1327-1333), in contrast to\\nexperimental observation of rocksalt LiF under ambient conditions. To address\\nthis discrepancy, we employ molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with a refined\\nmachine-learned force field (MLFF), and demonstrate the nucleation and\\ncrystallization of rocksalt LiF from the molten phase at temperatures below\\nabout 800 K. The rocksalt phase remains stable in LiF nanoparticles.\\nComplementary density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that dispersion\\ninteractions are essential for correctly predicting the thermodynamic stability\\nof rocksalt LiF over the wurtzite phase on top of the commonly used PBE\\nfunctional. Furthermore, we show that inclusion of virial stresses--alongside\\nenergies and forces--in the training of MLFFs is crucial for capturing phase\\nnucleation and crystallization of rocksalt LiF under the isothermal-isobaric\\nensemble. These findings underscore the critical role of dispersion\\ninteractions in atomistic simulations of battery materials, where such effects\\nare often non-negligible, and highlight the necessity of incorporating virial\\nstresses during the training of MLFF to enable accurate modeling of solid-state\\nsystems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T05:52:51Z\"}"}
