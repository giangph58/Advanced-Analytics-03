{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00258v1\", \"title\": \"Quantile-RK and Double Quantile-RK Error Horizon Analysis\", \"summary\": \"In solving linear systems of equations of the form $Ax=b$, corruptions\\npresent in $b$ affect stochastic iterative algorithms' ability to reach the\\ntrue solution $x^\\\\ast$ to the uncorrupted linear system. The randomized\\nKaczmarz method converges in expectation to $x^\\\\ast$ up to an error horizon\\ndependent on the conditioning of $A$ and the supremum norm of the corruption in\\n$b$. To avoid this error horizon in the sparse corruption setting, previous\\nworks have proposed quantile-based adaptations that make iterative methods\\nrobust. Our work first establishes a new convergence rate for the\\nquantile-based random Kaczmarz (qRK) and double quantile-based random Kaczmarz\\n(dqRK) methods, which, under mild conditions, improves upon known bounds. We\\nfurther consider the more practical setting in which the vector $b$ includes\\nboth non-sparse \\\"noise\\\" and sparse \\\"corruption\\\". Error horizon bounds for qRK\\nand dqRK are derived and shown to produce a smaller error horizon compared to\\ntheir non-quantile-based counterparts, further demonstrating the advantages of\\nquantile-based methods.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T02:48:15Z\"}"}
