In this\\nstudy, prompt engineering with the GPT-4 API was employed to generate\\nhigh-quality synthetic datasets aimed at overcoming this limitation. The\\ngenerated data encompassed a comprehensive array of patient admission\\ninformation, including healthcare provider details, hospital departments,\\nwards, bed assignments, patient demographics, emergency contacts, vital signs,\\nimmunizations, allergies, medical histories, appointments, hospital visits,\\nlaboratory tests, diagnoses, treatment plans, medications, clinical notes,\\nvisit logs, discharge summaries, and referrals. To ensure data quality and\\nintegrity, advanced validation techniques were implemented utilizing models\\nsuch as BERT's Next Sentence Prediction for sentence coherence, GPT-2 for\\noverall plausibility, RoBERTa for logical consistency, autoencoders for anomaly\\ndetection, and conducted diversity analysis. Synthetic data that met all\\nvalidation criteria were integrated into a comprehensive PostgreSQL database,\\nserving as the data management system for the EHR application. This approach\\ndemonstrates that leveraging generative AI models with rigorous validation can\\neffectively produce high-quality synthetic medical data, facilitating the\\ntraining of AI algorithms while addressing privacy concerns associated with\\nreal patient data.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T16:37:34Z\"}"}
