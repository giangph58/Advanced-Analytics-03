Consider a family\\nof coalescing Brownian motions started from every point in the subset $\\\\{ (0,x)\\n: x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\}$ of $[0,\\\\infty) \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}$ and proceeding\\naccording to the following rule: the interval $\\\\{t\\\\} \\\\times [L_t,U_t]$ between\\ntwo consecutive Brownian motions instantaneously `fragments' at rate $R(U_t -\\nL_t)$. At such a fragmentation event at a time $t$, we initiate new coalescing\\nBrownian motions from each of the points $\\\\{ (t,x) : x \\\\in [L_t,U_t]\\\\}$. The\\nresulting process, which we call the $R$-marble, is easily constructed when $R$\\nis bounded, and may be considered a random subset of the Brownian web.\\n  Under mild conditions, we show that it is possible to construct the\\n$R$-marble when $R$ is unbounded as a limit as $n \\\\to \\\\infty$ of $R_n$-marbles\\nwhere $R_n(g) = R(g) \\\\wedge n$. The behaviour of this limiting process is\\nmainly determined by the shape of $R$ near zero. The most interesting case\\noccurs when the limit $\\\\lim_{g \\\\downarrow 0} g^2 R(g) = \\\\lambda$ exists in\\n$(0,\\\\infty)$, in which we find a phase transition. For $\\\\lambda \\\\geq 6$, the\\nlimiting object is indistinguishable from the Brownian web, whereas if $\\\\lambda\\n< 6$, then the limiting object is a nontrivial stochastic process with large\\ngaps.\\n  When $R(g) = \\\\lambda/g^2$, the $R$-marble is a self-similar stochastic\\nprocess which we refer to as the \\\\emph{Brownian marble} with parameter $\\\\lambda\\n> 0$. We give an explicit description of the space-time correlations of the\\nBrownian Marble, which can be described in terms of an object we call the\\nBrownian vein; a spatial version of a recurrent extension of a killed\\nBessel-$3$ process.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T17:42:20Z\"}"}
