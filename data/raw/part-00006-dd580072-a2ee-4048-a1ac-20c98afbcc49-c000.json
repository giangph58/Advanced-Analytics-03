We study algebraic aspects of GL-racks and\\ncoloring invariants of Legendrian links.\\n  We answer an open question characterizing the group of GL-structures on a\\ngiven rack. As applications, we classify several infinite families of GL-racks.\\nWe also compute automorphism groups of dihedral GL-quandles and the categorical\\ncenter of GL-racks.\\n  Then we construct an equivalence of categories between racks and GL-quandles.\\n  We also study tensor products of racks and GL-racks coming from universal\\nalgebra. Surprisingly, the categories of racks and GL-racks have tensor units.\\nThe induced symmetric monoidal structure on medial racks is closed, and\\nsimilarly for medial GL-racks.\\n  Answering another open question, we use GL-racks to distinguish Legendrian\\nknots whose classical invariants are identical. In particular, we complete the\\nclassification of Legendrian $8_{13}$ knots.\\n  Finally, we use exhaustive search algorithms to classify GL-racks up to order\\n8.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GT\", \"categories\": \"math.GT,math.GR,math.QA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T06:05:09Z\"}"}
