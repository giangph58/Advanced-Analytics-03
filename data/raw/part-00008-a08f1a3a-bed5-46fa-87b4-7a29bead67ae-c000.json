(J. Geom. Anal., 2024, 34(6): No. 182, 44 pp) on the existence of a\\nmountain pass solution at positive energy level to the Br\\\\'{e}zis-Nirenberg\\nproblem with logarithmic perturbation. To be a little more precise, by taking\\nfull advantage of the local minimum solution and some very delicate estimates\\non the logarithmic term and the critical term, we prove that the following\\nproblem \\\\begin{eqnarray*} \\\\begin{cases} -\\\\Delta u= \\\\lambda u+\\\\mu|u|^2u+\\\\theta\\nu\\\\log u^2, &x\\\\in\\\\Omega,\\\\\\\\ u=0, &x\\\\in\\\\partial\\\\Omega \\\\end{cases} \\\\end{eqnarray*}\\npossesses a positive mountain pass solution at positive energy level, where\\n$\\\\Omega\\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^4$ is a bounded domain with smooth boundary\\n$\\\\partial\\\\Omega$, $\\\\lambda\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$, $\\\\mu>0$ and $\\\\theta<0$. A key step\\nin the proof is to control the mountain pass level around the local minimum\\nsolution from above by a proper constant to ensure the local compactness.\\nMoreover, this result is also extended to three-dimensional and\\nfive-dimensional cases.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T08:25:16Z\"}"}
