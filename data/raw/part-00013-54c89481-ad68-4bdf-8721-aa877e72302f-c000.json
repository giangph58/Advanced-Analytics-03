{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02825v1\", \"title\": \"From moving groups to star formation in the Solar Neighborhood\", \"summary\": \"Moving groups in the solar neighborhood are ensembles of co-moving stars,\\nlikely originating due to forces from spiral arms, the Galactic bar, or\\nexternal perturbations. Their co-movement with young clusters indicates recent\\nstar formation within these moving groups, but a lack of precise\\nthree-dimensional position and velocity measurements has obscured this\\nconnection. Using backward orbit integrations of 509 clusters within 1 kpc -\\nbased on Gaia DR3 and supplemented with APOGEE-2 and GALAH DR3 radial\\nvelocities - we trace their evolution over the past 100 Myr. We find that most\\nclusters separate into three spatial groups that each trace one of the\\nPleiades, Coma Berenices, and Sirius moving groups. The same trend is not seen\\nfor the Hyades moving group. The young clusters of the Alpha Persei, Messier 6,\\nand Collinder 135 families of clusters, previously found to have formed in\\nthree massive star-forming complexes, co-move with either the Pleiades (Alpha\\nPersei and Messier 6) or Coma Berenices (Collinder 135). Our results provide a\\nsharper view of how large-scale Galactic dynamics have shaped recent, nearby\\nstar formation.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T17:59:52Z\"}"}
