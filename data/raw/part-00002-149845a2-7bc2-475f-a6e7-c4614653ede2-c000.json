Since the\\nlevel set method can use a signed distance function as an initial condition,\\nthe eikonal equation on the boundary is a suitable choice at the initial time.\\nEnforcing the eikonal equation on the boundary for later times can eliminate\\nthe need for inflow boundary conditions, which are typically required for\\ntransport equations. In selected examples where exact solutions are available,\\nwe compare the proposed method with the method using the exact Dirichlet\\nboundary condition. The numerical results confirm that the use of the eikonal\\nboundary condition provides comparable accuracy and robustness in surface\\nevolution compared to the use of the exact Dirichlet boundary condition, which\\nis generally not available. We also present numerical results of evolving a\\ngeneral closed surface.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:25:19Z\"}"}
