{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04343v1\", \"title\": \"Atmospheric loss during giant impacts: mechanisms and scaling of near-\\n  and far-field loss\", \"summary\": \"The primary epoch of planetary accretion concludes with giant impacts -\\nhighly energetic collisions between proto-planets that can play a key role in\\nshaping a planet's inventory of volatile elements. Previous work has shown that\\nsingle giant impacts have the potential to eject a significant amount of a\\nplanet's atmosphere but that the efficiency of atmospheric loss depends\\nstrongly on the impact parameters and atmospheric properties. Fully quantifying\\nthe role of giant impacts in planetary volatile evolution requires a more\\ncomplete understanding of the mechanisms driving loss during impacts. Here, we\\nuse a suite of 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to show that loss\\nin giant impacts is controlled primarily by ejecta plumes near the impact site\\nand breakout of the impact shock in the far field, with the efficiency of the\\nlatter well approximated by 1D ground-kick calculations. The relative\\ncontributions of each mechanism to loss changes drastically with varying impact\\nparameters. By considering the near and far field separately, we present a\\nscaling law that precisely approximates (to within an average of $\\\\sim$3%) loss\\nfrom 0.35 to 5.0 Earth mass planets with 5% mass fraction H$_2$-He atmospheres\\nfor any combination of impactor mass, impact velocity, and angle. Finally, we\\napply our scaling law to the results of $N$-body simulations for different\\nsolar system formation scenarios. We find that while individual impacts rarely\\ncause significant loss ($>$10%) from roughly Earth-mass planets with such\\nmassive primary atmospheres, the cumulative effect of multiple impacts can be\\nsubstantial (40-70% loss).\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T11:43:20Z\"}"}
