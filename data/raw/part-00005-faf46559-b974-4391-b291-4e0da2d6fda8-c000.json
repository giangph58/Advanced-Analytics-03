To minimize or eliminate dispersion mismatch, most, if not all,\\nfiber-based OCT realisations employ a reference arm configuration that is as\\nclosely identical to the measurement arm as possible. This typically includes a\\ncollimator, dispersion compensating material (or sometimes a set of lenses), as\\nwell as a mirror (or retro-reflector) mounted on a translation stage. However,\\nthis solution makes the total instrument cost higher and the setup bulkier than\\nnecessary and it also renders the reference arm mechanically unstable. Here, a\\nsimple yet robust, low-cost reference arm setup is presented and its ability to\\ncompensate for measurement arm dispersion is demonstrated. We use a single-mode\\nfiber cleaved and polished perpendicular to the fiber axis to construct the\\nreference arm. The length and material of the fibre is determined by\\nconsidering the optical path length and dispersion of the measurement arm.\\nExperimental images demonstrate the operation of the novel reference arm in our\\nSwept-source Optical Coherence Tomography.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T13:40:50Z\"}"}
