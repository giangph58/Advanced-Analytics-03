{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20809v1\", \"title\": \"Periodic Proprioceptive Stimuli Learning and Internal Model Development\\n  for Avian-inspired Flapping-wing Flight State Estimation\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents a novel learning-based approach for online state\\nestimation in flapping wing aerial vehicles (FWAVs). Leveraging low-cost\\nMagnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity (MARG) sensors, the proposed method\\neffectively mitigates the adverse effects of flapping-induced oscillations that\\nchallenge conventional estimation techniques. By employing a divide-and-conquer\\nstrategy grounded in cycle-averaged aerodynamics, the framework decouples the\\nslow-varying components from the high-frequency oscillatory components, thereby\\npreserving critical transient behaviors while delivering an smooth internal\\nstate representation. The complete oscillatory state of FWAV can be\\nreconstructed based on above two components, leading to substantial\\nimprovements in accurate state prediction. Experimental validations on an\\navian-inspired FWAV demonstrate that the estimator enhances accuracy and\\nsmoothness, even under complex aerodynamic disturbances. These encouraging\\nresults highlight the potential of learning algorithms to overcome issues of\\nflapping-wing induced oscillation dynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:21:40Z\"}"}
