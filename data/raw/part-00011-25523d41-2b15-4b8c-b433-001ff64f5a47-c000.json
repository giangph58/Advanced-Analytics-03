{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13174v1\", \"title\": \"Quantum algorithm for solving nonlinear differential equations based on\\n  physics-informed effective Hamiltonians\", \"summary\": \"We propose a distinct approach to solving linear and nonlinear differential\\nequations (DEs) on quantum computers by encoding the problem into ground states\\nof effective Hamiltonian operators. Our algorithm relies on constructing such\\noperators in the Chebyshev space, where an effective Hamiltonian is a sum of\\nglobal differential and data constraints. Once the effective Hamiltonian is\\nformed, solutions of differential equations can be obtained using the ground\\nstate preparation techniques (e.g. imaginary-time evolution and quantum\\nsingular value transformation), bypassing variational search. Unlike approaches\\nbased on discrete grids, the algorithm enables evaluation of solutions beyond\\nfixed grid points and implements constraints in the physics-informed way. Our\\nproposal inherits the best traits from quantum machine learning-based DE\\nsolving (compact basis representation, automatic differentiation, nonlinearity)\\nand quantum linear algebra-based approaches (fine-grid encoding, provable\\nspeed-up for state preparation), offering a robust strategy for quantum\\nscientific computing in the early fault-tolerant era.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:59:33Z\"}"}
