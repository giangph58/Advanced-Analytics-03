{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19634v1\", \"title\": \"NSegment : Noisy Segment Improves Remote Sensing Image Segmentation\", \"summary\": \"Labeling errors in remote sensing (RS) image segmentation datasets often\\nremain implicit and subtle due to ambiguous class boundaries, mixed pixels,\\nshadows, complex terrain features, and subjective annotator bias. Furthermore,\\nthe scarcity of annotated RS data due to high image acquisition and labeling\\ncosts complicates training noise-robust models. While sophisticated mechanisms\\nsuch as label selection or noise correction might address this issue, they tend\\nto increase training time and add implementation complexity. In this letter, we\\npropose NSegment-a simple yet effective data augmentation solution to mitigate\\nthis issue. Unlike traditional methods, it applies elastic transformations only\\nto segmentation labels, varying deformation intensity per sample in each\\ntraining epoch to address annotation inconsistencies. Experimental results\\ndemonstrate that our approach improves the performance of RS image segmentation\\non various state-of-the-art models.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T09:49:35Z\"}"}
