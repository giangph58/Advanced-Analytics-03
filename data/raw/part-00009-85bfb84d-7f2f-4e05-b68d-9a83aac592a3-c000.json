{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07829v1\", \"title\": \"A Hybrid Semantic RAN Protocol Stack Design for 6G System and Its\\n  Implementation\", \"summary\": \"Recently, Semantic Communication (SC) has been recognized as a crucial new\\nparadigm in 6G, significantly improving information transmission efficiency.\\nHowever, the diverse range of service types in 6G networks, such as\\nhigh-data-volume services like AR/VR/MR and low-data-volume applications\\nrequiring high accuracy, such as industrial control and data collection,\\npresents significant challenges to fully replacing the fundamental technologies\\nwith SC. Therefore, we design a Hybrid Semantic Communication Ratio Access\\nNetwork (HSC-RAN) protocol stack demo for 6G systems to achieve compatibility\\nand smooth transition between SC and non-SC. Specifically, we take the Physical\\nDownlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) as an example, to efficiently integrate SC with\\nOrthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). Furthermore, we introduce a\\nnovel Downlink Control Information (DCI) format that jointly supports SC and\\nnon-SC, enabling real-time video transmission via SC and text transmission\\nthrough non-SC. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach allows\\nsimultaneous transmission of semantic and non-semantic information while\\nmaintaining high-quality reconstruction at the receiver.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:06:11Z\"}"}
