A wide class of physical systems of interest\\nhave solutions that exhibit the formation of structures, called features, which\\nhave to be accurately captured by the assimilation framework. For example,\\nfluids can develop features such as shockwaves and contact discontinuities that\\nneed to be tracked and preserved during data assimilation. State-of-the-art\\ndata assimilation techniques are agnostic of such features. Current\\nensemble-based methods construct state estimates by taking linear combinations\\nof multiple ensemble states; repeated averaging tends to smear the features\\nover multiple assimilation cycles, leading to nonphysical state estimates. A\\nnovel feature-preserving data assimilation methodology that combines sequence\\nalignment with the ensemble transform particle filter is proposed to overcome\\nthis limitation of existing assimilation algorithms. Specifically, optimal\\ntransport of particles is performed along feature-aligned characteristics. The\\nstrength of the proposed feature-preserving filtering approach is demonstrated\\non multiple test problems described by the compressible Euler equations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T02:19:34Z\"}"}
