This TNC exhibits novels features, including the\\nfact that the gauge fields associated with both dilatation and rotation\\nsymmetries transform non-trivially under Galilean boosts. This theory also\\nreproduces the Schr\\\\\\\"odinger gravity acquired by gauging the extended $z=2$\\nSchr\\\\\\\"odinger algebra \\\\cite{Hartong:2016yrf} via $1/c$ expansion. In\\nparticular, we explain that the $z=2$ Lifshitz geometry appearing in the\\nSchr\\\\\\\"odinger gravity is related to the null reduction of 4d\\n$\\\\Omega$-background up to a conformal factor. Based on these results, we\\nrevisit the identification between the extended Schr\\\\\\\"odinger algebra and the\\nbosonic analogue of super BMS algebra \\\\cite{Chernyavsky:2019hyp}. We interpret\\nthat this relation originates from the $\\\\mathcal{W}_3^{(2)}$ algebra which acts\\nas the bosonic analogue of $\\\\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal algebra.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:49:34Z\"}"}
