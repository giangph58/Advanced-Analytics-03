The\\nreliability of journeys involving transfers is affected by the reliability of\\nthe transfers and the consequences of missing a transfer, as well as the\\npossible delay of the train used to reach the destination. In this paper, we\\npropose a flexible method to model the reliability of train journeys with any\\nnumber of transfers. The method combines a transfer reliability model based on\\ngradient boosting responsible for predicting the reliability of transfers\\nbetween trains and a delay model based on probabilistic Bayesian regression,\\nwhich is used to model train arrival delays. The models are trained on delay\\ndata from four Swedish train stations and evaluated on delay data from another\\ntwo stations, in order to evaluate the generalization performance of the\\nmodels. We show that the probabilistic delay model, which models train delays\\nfollowing a mixture distribution with two lognormal components, allows to much\\nmore realistically model the distribution of actual train delays compared to a\\nstandard lognormal model. Finally, we show how these models can be used\\ntogether to sample the arrival delay at the final destination of the entire\\njourney. The results indicate that the method accurately predicts the\\nreliability for nine out of ten tested journeys. The method could be used to\\nimprove journey planners by providing reliability information to travelers.\\nFurther applications include timetable planning and transport modeling.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T12:13:55Z\"}"}
