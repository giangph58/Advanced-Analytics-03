{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13025v1\", \"title\": \"Magnetism-Enhanced Strong Electron-Phonon Coupling in Infinite-Layer\\n  Nickelate\", \"summary\": \"Intriguing analogies between the nickelates and the cuprates provide a\\npromising avenue for unraveling the microscopic mechanisms underlying\\nhigh-$T_c$ superconductivity. While electron correlation effects in the\\nnickelates have been extensively studied, the role of electron-phonon coupling\\n(EPC) remains highly controversial. Here, by taking pristine LaNiO$_2$ as an\\nexemplar nickelate, we present an in-depth study of EPC for both the\\nnon-magnetic (NM) and the $C$-type antiferromagnetic ($C$-AFM) phase using\\nadvanced density functional theory methods without invoking $U$ or other free\\nparameters. The weak EPC strength $\\\\lambda$ in the NM phase is found to be\\ngreatly enhanced ($\\\\sim$4$\\\\times$) due to the presence of magnetism in the\\n$C$-AFM phase. This enhancement arises from strong interactions between the\\nflat bands associated with the Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ orbitals and the low-frequency\\nphonon modes driven by the vibrations of Ni and La atoms. The resulting phonon\\nsoftening is shown to yield a distinctive kink in the electronic structure\\naround 15 meV, which would provide an experimentally testable signature of our\\npredictions. Our study highlights the critical role of local magnetic moments\\nand interply EPC in the nickelate.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T15:35:10Z\"}"}
