{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04177v1\", \"title\": \"Impact of Grid-Forming Inverters on Protective Relays: A Perspective for\\n  Current Limiting Control Design\", \"summary\": \"Grid-forming (GFM) inverters can significantly alter the fault\\ncharacteristics of power systems, which challenges the proper function of\\nprotective relays. This paper gives a holistic analysis of the interaction\\nbetween GFM inverter-based resources (IBRs) and the supervising elements in\\nprotective relays, including directional and phase selection elements. It is\\nrevealed that the current limiting control (CLC) that is based on the current\\nreference saturation method, adversely affects the performance of supervising\\nelements that rely on the negative-sequence quantities. In contrast, adopting\\nhighly inductive virtual impedance in the CLC enables a reliable operation of\\nsuch elements. This finding provides insights into the design of CLC for GFM\\nIBRs from a protection perspective. It is further found that even with a highly\\ninductive virtual impedance, the altered virtual impedance dynamics introduced\\nby the CLC can still lead to malfunctions of the incremental quantity-based\\nsupervising elements. These theoretical findings are corroborated by\\nsimulations and controller hardware-in-the-loop (CHIL) tests.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T07:15:02Z\"}"}
