{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20878v1\", \"title\": \"On the structure of the dimension spectrum for continued fraction\\n  expansions\", \"summary\": \"We analyse the dimension spectrum of continued fractions expansions with\\ncoefficients restricted to infinite subsets of $ \\\\mathbb{N}$. We prove that the\\nset of powers $P_q=\\\\{q^n\\\\colon n\\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}\\\\}$ has full dimension spectrum\\nfor each integer $q\\\\geq 2$, answering a question by Chousionis, Leykekhman and\\nUrba\\\\'nski. On the other hand, we show that the dimension spectrum for\\n$P^*_q=\\\\{q^n\\\\colon n\\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}\\\\}\\\\cup\\\\{1\\\\}$ has many gaps and regions where\\nit is nowhere dense. We also investigate the case where $A$ is generated by a\\nmonomial, $M_q=\\\\{n^q\\\\colon n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}\\\\}$. For $M_q$ we prove that the\\ndimension spectrum is full for $q\\\\in\\\\{1,2,3,4,5\\\\}$, and it has a gap for each\\n$q\\\\geq 6$. Furthermore we show for $q\\\\in\\\\{6,7,8\\\\}$ that the dimension spectrum\\nof $M_q$ is the disjoint union of two nontrivial closed intervals, and it is\\nthe disjoint union of three nontrivial closed intervals for $q \\\\in\\\\{9,10\\\\}$.\\nFor $q\\\\geq 11$ we show that the dimension spectrum of $M_q$ consists of\\nfinitely many disjoint nontrivial closed intervals. The results concerning\\n$M_q$ extend existing results for $q=1$ and $q=2$. In our analysis we employ\\nPerron-Frobenius (transfer) operators, and numerical tools developed by Falk\\nand Nussbaum that give rigorous estimates for the Hausdorff dimension for\\ncontinued fractions expansions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT,math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T15:48:11Z\"}"}
