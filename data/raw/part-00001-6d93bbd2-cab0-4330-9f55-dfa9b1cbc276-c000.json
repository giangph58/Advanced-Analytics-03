We develop two optimal control\\nmodels-- a linear and a non-linear extension of (Martin and Stahn, 2013) --that\\nincorporate the impact of fertilizers on aquifer water quality, distinguishing\\nbetween organic and conventional farming practices. The linear model applies a\\nconstant rebate mechanism, whereas the non-linear model employs a concave\\nrebate scheme. Our results show that, depending on climate change scenarios,\\nfertilizer-induced food price discounts, and pollution levels, a socially\\noptimal equilibrium in fertilizer use can be attained. Policy implications are\\ndiscussed, emphasizing the trade-off between environmental sustainability and\\nsocial welfare.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T15:01:41Z\"}"}
