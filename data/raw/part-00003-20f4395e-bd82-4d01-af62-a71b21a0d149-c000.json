Alongside, a\\ncomprehensive and rigorous mathematical analysis of the linearization errors\\ncommitted is presented, and the work is complemented with extensive synthetic\\nsimulations and performance benchmarking with the scope of gauging and\\nstress-testing the techniques in different scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T08:03:02Z\"}"}
