{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19539v1\", \"title\": \"Monitoring North African regional tourism by web data\", \"summary\": \"The purpose of this article is to explore the opportunity of recent and\\ndetailed unconventional data from the tourism sector collected from\\n{\\\\guillemotleft} Booking.com {\\\\guillemotright} to make a finer and more\\nup-to-date analysis than that established by conventional data, particularly,\\nat the territorial level of North Africa. We extracted and geolocalised about\\n40 variables of different types covering 1852 accommodations on Booking.com to\\nanalyze the characteristics of territorial tourist offer of the six North\\nAfrican countries (10 of 12 Moroccan regions, 3 of 13 Mauritanian Wilayas, 26\\nof 48 Algerian Wilayas, 13 of 24 Tunisian Governorates, 1 region of Libya, 15\\nof 27 Egyptian Mohafazats). Then, we used a random sample of 10% of the most\\nrecent appreciations of nearly 606000 tourists of the three most dynamic\\ndestinations (Marrakech-Safi, Tunis, Cairo) by analyzing the feelings of their\\ncomments with a differentiation according origin of tourists. We concluded that\\nthe accommodation offer of the territories of North Africa is very diversified\\nand unclassified offers are slightly better appreciated compared to those\\nclassified. The coastal regions have higher prices compared to the interior of\\nthe countries and quality-price appreciation of North African regions is below\\ntheir overall ratings.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T07:43:37Z\"}"}
