Using\\nthe source operator philosophy we construct such operators for generic\\ninduction parameters of the representations and establish that this approach\\nyields all possible operators in this setting. We show that these differential\\noperators occur as residues of a family of symmetry breaking operators that\\ndepends meromorphically on the parameters. Finally, in the $n=2$ case we\\nclassify and construct all differential symmetry breaking operators for any\\nparameters, including the non-generic ones.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RT\", \"categories\": \"math.RT,math.CA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:10:04Z\"}"}
