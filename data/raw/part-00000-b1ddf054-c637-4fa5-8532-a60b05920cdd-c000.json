{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19802v1\", \"title\": \"Crystal field excitations in rattling clathrate CeBa$_7$Au$_6$Si$_{40}$\", \"summary\": \"We investigate the local crystal-field environment of cerium in the clathrate\\ncompound CeBa$_7$Au$_6$Si$_{40}$ (Ce-BAS) using resonant inelastic x-ray\\nscattering (RIXS) and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Ce-BAS is a rare\\nexample of a system where heavy-fermion physics coexists with low-energy\\nrattling phonon modes, making it a candidate for enhanced thermoelectric\\nperformance. Magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal a\\ntemperature-dependent local moment that cannot be explained within a static\\ncrystal-field model. A fit to the susceptibility data requires strong mixing\\nbetween the j = 5/2 and j = 7/2 crystal-field states, which implies large\\ninternal splittings inconsistent with RIXS spectra. In contrast, RIXS data are\\nwell described by a model with negligible j = 5/2 - j = 7/2 mixing and an\\nenergy separation of 12 meV between the ground and first excited crystal-field\\nstates. The inability to reconcile these two datasets within a static framework\\npoints to a dynamical modification of the crystal-field potential. We attribute\\nthis to coupling between the Ce 4f electrons and low-energy phonons associated\\nwith the Ce rattling motion. This interpretation is consistent with theoretical\\npredictions of phonon-enhanced Kondo effects and dynamical Jahn-Teller\\ndistortions. Our results highlight the need for multi-orbital impurity models\\nthat include phonon coupling to fully describe the low-energy physics of\\nCe-BAS.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T13:51:32Z\"}"}
