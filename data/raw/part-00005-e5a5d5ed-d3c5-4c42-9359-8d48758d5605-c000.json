The total cross section of\\n$J/\\\\psi \\\\mbox{-} J/\\\\psi$ ($\\\\eta_c \\\\mbox{-} \\\\eta_c$) in Pb-Pb UPC is 28.0 (65.1)\\nnb at nucleon-nucleon c.m. energy $\\\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.52$ TeV. Due to the\\nbackgrounds from various QCD interactions at UPC are highly suppressed and the\\nevent topologies for charmonium pair are easy to tag, the phenomenological\\nstudies at the LHC and FCC are feasible. The detailed transverse momentum\\n$p_T$, diphoton invariant mass $m_{\\\\gamma\\\\gamma}$ and the rapidity difference\\n$\\\\Delta y$ distributions are given. The production for X(6900) is also\\ndiscussed.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T04:15:46Z\"}"}
