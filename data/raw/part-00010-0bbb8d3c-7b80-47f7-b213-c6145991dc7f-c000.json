{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10009v1\", \"title\": \"The Bispectrum of Intrinsic Alignments: Theory Modelling and Forecasts\\n  for Stage IV Galaxy Surveys\", \"summary\": \"We present a complete treatment of the bispectrum of intrinsic alignments,\\nboth in three spatial dimensions and in projection in the flat-sky\\napproximation. Since intrinsic alignment is a spin-2 observable, the bispectrum\\nof intrinsic alignments contains a parity-even and a parity-odd part, the\\nlatter being nonzero even in the absence of parity violation. Moreover, all\\npossible combinations of scalar, E- and B-mode bispectra are nonzero in the\\nabsence of parity violation. In analogy to the galaxy bispectrum in redshift\\nspace, we construct a complete set of multipoles for anisotropic bispectra of\\nprojected spin-2 fields. We then construct separable bispectrum estimators,\\nboth for parity-even and parity-odd bispectra, which can be computed by means\\nof Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs). We compare several different choices of\\nangular weighting in terms of signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) for a Stage IV setup\\nusing luminous red galaxies (LRGs) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic\\nInstrument (DESI) with galaxy shapes measured by the Legacy Survey of Space and\\nTime (LSST). Assuming an overlapping area of $\\\\sim 4,000$ square degrees\\n(yielding $\\\\sim 1.3$ million LRGs) and including scales up to $k_\\\\text{max} =\\n0.14\\\\,h$/Mpc, we find that the position-position-E-mode bispectrum $B_{DDE}$\\n(which is parity-even) can be strongly detected at SNR $\\\\sim 30$, while\\ndetecting parity-odd bispectra (such as $B_{DDB}$, SNR $\\\\sim 5$) or bispectra\\nwith more than one shape field (such as $B_{DEE}$, SNR $\\\\sim 5$) may also be\\npossible.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:16:46Z\"}"}
