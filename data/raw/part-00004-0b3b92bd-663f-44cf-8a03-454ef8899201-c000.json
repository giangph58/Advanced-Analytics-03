{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19607v1\", \"title\": \"Adaptive Locomotion on Mud through Proprioceptive Sensing of Substrate\\n  Properties\", \"summary\": \"Muddy terrains present significant challenges for terrestrial robots, as\\nsubtle changes in composition and water content can lead to large variations in\\nsubstrate strength and force responses, causing the robot to slip or get stuck.\\nThis paper presents a method to estimate mud properties using proprioceptive\\nsensing, enabling a flipper-driven robot to adapt its locomotion through muddy\\nsubstrates of varying strength. First, we characterize mud reaction forces\\nthrough actuator current and position signals from a statically mounted robotic\\nflipper. We use the measured force to determine key coefficients that\\ncharacterize intrinsic mud properties. The proprioceptively estimated\\ncoefficients match closely with measurements from a lab-grade load cell,\\nvalidating the effectiveness of the proposed method. Next, we extend the method\\nto a locomoting robot to estimate mud properties online as it crawls across\\ndifferent mud mixtures. Experimental data reveal that mud reaction forces\\ndepend sensitively on robot motion, requiring joint analysis of robot movement\\nwith proprioceptive force to determine mud properties correctly. Lastly, we\\ndeploy this method in a flipper-driven robot moving across muddy substrates of\\nvarying strengths, and demonstrate that the proposed method allows the robot to\\nuse the estimated mud properties to adapt its locomotion strategy, and\\nsuccessfully avoid locomotion failures. Our findings highlight the potential of\\nproprioception-based terrain sensing to enhance robot mobility in complex,\\ndeformable natural environments, paving the way for more robust field\\nexploration capabilities.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T09:12:21Z\"}"}
