{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01855v1\", \"title\": \"Enhanced Diffusion Sampling via Extrapolation with Multiple ODE\\n  Solutions\", \"summary\": \"Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs), while effective in generating\\nhigh-quality samples, often suffer from high computational costs due to their\\niterative sampling process. To address this, we propose an enhanced ODE-based\\nsampling method for DPMs inspired by Richardson extrapolation, which reduces\\nnumerical error and improves convergence rates. Our method, RX-DPM, leverages\\nmultiple ODE solutions at intermediate time steps to extrapolate the denoised\\nprediction in DPMs. This significantly enhances the accuracy of estimations for\\nthe final sample while maintaining the number of function evaluations (NFEs).\\nUnlike standard Richardson extrapolation, which assumes uniform discretization\\nof the time grid, we develop a more general formulation tailored to arbitrary\\ntime step scheduling, guided by local truncation error derived from a baseline\\nsampling method. The simplicity of our approach facilitates accurate estimation\\nof numerical solutions without significant computational overhead, and allows\\nfor seamless and convenient integration into various DPMs and solvers.\\nAdditionally, RX-DPM provides explicit error estimates, effectively\\ndemonstrating the faster convergence as the leading error term's order\\nincreases. Through a series of experiments, we show that the proposed method\\nimproves the quality of generated samples without requiring additional sampling\\niterations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T16:06:23Z\"}"}
