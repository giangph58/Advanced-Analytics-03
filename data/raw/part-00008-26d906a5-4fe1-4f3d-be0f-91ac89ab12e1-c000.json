In this paper, we\\nexplore the pair production of TeV-scale vector-like B quark (VLQ-$B$) at the\\nfuture 3 TeV Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) in simplified effective lagrangian\\nframework. We consider the decay modes of $B\\\\rightarrow bZ$ and $B\\\\rightarrow\\nbh$ followed by hadronic decay of $Z$ and $h$ bosons. The large mass of VLQ-$B$\\nwill induce highly boosted bosons $Z$ or $h$ which are more likely to form as\\nfat-jets. By performing a rapid detector simulation of the signal and\\nbackground events and clustering the jets with a large radius R,\\nsignal-background analyses are carried out. And the exclusion limit at the 95\\\\%\\nconfidence level and the 5$\\\\sigma$ discovery prospects are obtained with an\\nintegrated luminosity of 5$\\\\text{ab}^{-1}$.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T13:25:55Z\"}"}
