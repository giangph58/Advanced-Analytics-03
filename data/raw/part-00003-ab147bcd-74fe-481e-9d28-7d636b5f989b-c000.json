Existing diffusion-based approaches for TSF primarily focus on modeling\\nsingle-modality numerical sequences, overlooking the rich multimodal\\ninformation in time series data. To effectively leverage such information for\\nprediction, we propose a multimodal conditioned diffusion model for TSF,\\nnamely, MCD-TSF, to jointly utilize timestamps and texts as extra guidance for\\ntime series modeling, especially for forecasting. Specifically, Timestamps are\\ncombined with time series to establish temporal and semantic correlations among\\ndifferent data points when aggregating information along the temporal\\ndimension. Texts serve as supplementary descriptions of time series' history,\\nand adaptively aligned with data points as well as dynamically controlled in a\\nclassifier-free manner. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets\\nacross eight domains demonstrate that the proposed MCD-TSF model achieves\\nstate-of-the-art performance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T10:56:23Z\"}"}
