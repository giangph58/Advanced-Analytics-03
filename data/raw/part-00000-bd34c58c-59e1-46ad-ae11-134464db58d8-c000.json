{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21759v1\", \"title\": \"Smart Environmental Monitoring of Marine Pollution using Edge AI\", \"summary\": \"Oil spill incidents pose severe threats to marine ecosystems and coastal\\nenvironments, necessitating rapid detection and monitoring capabilities to\\nmitigate environmental damage. In this paper, we demonstrate how artificial\\nintelligence, despite the inherent high computational and memory requirements,\\ncan be efficiently integrated into marine pollution monitoring systems. More\\nprecisely, we propose a drone-based smart monitoring system leveraging a\\ncompressed deep learning U-Net architecture for oil spill detection and\\nthickness estimation. Compared to the standard U-Net architecture, the number\\nof convolution blocks and channels per block are modified. The new model is\\nthen trained on synthetic radar data to accurately predict thick oil slick\\nthickness up to 10 mm. Results show that our optimized Tiny U-Net achieves\\nsuperior performance with an Intersection over Union (IoU) metric of\\napproximately 79%, while simultaneously reducing the model size by a factor of\\n$\\\\sim$269x compared to the state-of-the-art. This significant model compression\\nenables efficient edge computing deployment on field-programmable gate array\\n(FPGA) hardware integrated directly into the drone platform. Hardware\\nimplementation demonstrates near real-time thickness estimation capabilities\\nwith a run-time power consumption of approximately 2.2 watts. Our findings\\nhighlight the increasing potential of smart monitoring technologies and\\nefficient edge computing for operational characterization in marine\\nenvironments.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T15:59:35Z\"}"}
