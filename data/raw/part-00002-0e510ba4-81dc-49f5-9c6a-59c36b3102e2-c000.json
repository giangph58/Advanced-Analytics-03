This\\ninteraction originates from the combined influence of the orbital and exchange\\nphenomena and can result in the spontaneous formation of non-collinear magnetic\\nstates in these systems. The proposed nonlinear coupling mechanism and\\nresulting changes of magnetic textures are crucial for the design of the\\nsuperconducting spintronics devices exploiting the long-range spin triplet\\nproximity effect.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T06:42:14Z\"}"}
