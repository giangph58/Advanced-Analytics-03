{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06245v1\", \"title\": \"Underwater Robotic Simulators Review for Autonomous System Development\", \"summary\": \"The increasing complexity of underwater robotic systems has led to a surge in\\nsimulation platforms designed to support perception, planning, and control\\ntasks in marine environments. However, selecting the most appropriate\\nunderwater robotic simulator (URS) remains a challenge due to wide variations\\nin fidelity, extensibility, and task suitability. This paper presents a\\ncomprehensive review and comparative analysis of five state-of-the-art,\\nROS-compatible, open-source URSs: Stonefish, DAVE, HoloOcean, MARUS, and\\nUNav-Sim. Each simulator is evaluated across multiple criteria including sensor\\nfidelity, environmental realism, sim-to-real capabilities, and research impact.\\nWe evaluate them across architectural design, sensor and physics modeling, task\\ncapabilities, and research impact. Additionally, we discuss ongoing challenges\\nin sim-to-real transfer and highlight the need for standardization and\\nbenchmarking in the field. Our findings aim to guide practitioners in selecting\\neffective simulation environments and inform future development of more robust\\nand transferable URSs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T17:43:48Z\"}"}
