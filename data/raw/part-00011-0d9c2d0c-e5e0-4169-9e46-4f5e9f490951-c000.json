The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for tumor detection\\nhas shown promise, but existing models often suffer from overparameterization,\\nwhich limits their performance gains. In this study, fuzzy sigmoid convolution\\n(FSC) is introduced along with two additional modules: top-of-the-funnel and\\nmiddle-of-the-funnel. The proposed methodology significantly reduces the number\\nof trainable parameters without compromising classification accuracy. A novel\\nconvolutional operator is central to this approach, effectively dilating the\\nreceptive field while preserving input data integrity. This enables efficient\\nfeature map reduction and enhances the model's tumor detection capability. In\\nthe FSC-based model, fuzzy sigmoid activation functions are incorporated within\\nconvolutional layers to improve feature extraction and classification. The\\ninclusion of fuzzy logic into the architecture improves its adaptability and\\nrobustness. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the\\nsuperior performance and efficiency of the proposed model. The FSC-based\\narchitecture achieved classification accuracies of 99.17%, 99.75%, and 99.89%\\non three different datasets. The model employs 100 times fewer parameters than\\nlarge-scale transfer learning architectures, highlighting its computational\\nefficiency and suitability for detecting brain tumors early. This research\\noffers lightweight, high-performance deep-learning models for medical imaging\\napplications.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:02:44Z\"}"}
