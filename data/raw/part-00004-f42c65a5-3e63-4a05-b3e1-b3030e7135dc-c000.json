However, the limited\\navailability of large-scale, high-quality CMR datasets poses a major challenge\\nto the effective application of artificial intelligence (AI) in this domain.\\nEven the amount of unlabeled data and the health status it covers are difficult\\nto meet the needs of model pretraining, which hinders the performance of AI\\nmodels on downstream tasks. In this study, we present Cardiac Phenotype-Guided\\nCMR Generation (CPGG), a novel approach for generating diverse CMR data that\\ncovers a wide spectrum of cardiac health status. The CPGG framework consists of\\ntwo stages: in the first stage, a generative model is trained using cardiac\\nphenotypes derived from CMR data; in the second stage, a masked autoregressive\\ndiffusion model, conditioned on these phenotypes, generates high-fidelity CMR\\ncine sequences that capture both structural and functional features of the\\nheart in a fine-grained manner. We synthesized a massive amount of CMR to\\nexpand the pretraining data. Experimental results show that CPGG generates\\nhigh-quality synthetic CMR data, significantly improving performance on various\\ndownstream tasks, including diagnosis and cardiac phenotypes prediction. These\\ngains are demonstrated across both public and private datasets, highlighting\\nthe effectiveness of our approach.
