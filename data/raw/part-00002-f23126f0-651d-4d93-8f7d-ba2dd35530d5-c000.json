This method relies on second order\\noptical nonlinearities and is complementary to second harmonic generation\\nspectroscopy. Here, we report coherent THz emission from Josephson plasmons in\\nunderdoped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$, and find that the amplitude of the emitted\\nfield increases dramatically close to the superconducting transition\\ntemperature, $T_C$. We show theoretically how emission is enhanced by critical\\nsuperconducting fluctuations, a nonlinear analogue of critical opalescence.\\nThis observation is expected to be of general importance for the study of many\\nthermal and quantum phase transitions.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T13:31:46Z\"}"}
