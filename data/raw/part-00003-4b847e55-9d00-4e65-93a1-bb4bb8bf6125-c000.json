{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17270v1\", \"title\": \"Thermally quenched metastable phase in the Ising model with competing\\n  interactions\", \"summary\": \"Thermal quenching has been used to find metastable materials such as hard\\nsteels and metallic glasses. More recently, quenching-based phase control has\\nbeen applied to correlated electron systems that exhibit metal--insulator,\\nmagnetic or superconducting transitions. Despite the discovery of metastable\\nelectronic phases, however, how metastability is achieved through the degrees\\nof freedom, which can vary even at low temperatures such as those of an\\nelectron, is unclear. Here, we show a thermally quenched metastable phase in\\nthe Ising model without conservation of magnetization by Monte Carlo\\nsimulations. When multiple types of interactions that stabilize different\\nlong-range orders are introduced, the ordering kinetics divergently slow toward\\nlow temperatures, meaning that the system will reach a low temperature without\\nordering if the cooling rate is high enough. Quantitative analysis of the\\ndivergent behavior suggests that the energy barrier for eliminating the local\\nstructure of competing orders is the origin of this metastability. Thus, the\\npresent simulations show that competing interactions play a key role in\\nrealizing metastability.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T05:58:07Z\"}"}
