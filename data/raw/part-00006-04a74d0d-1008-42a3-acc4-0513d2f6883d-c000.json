For\\nevery $\\\\mathcal G$ and $H$ it holds \\\\[\\n  {\\\\rm cn}_{g}^{\\\\mathcal{G}}(H) \\\\geq {\\\\rm cn}_{u}^{\\\\mathcal{G}}(H) \\\\geq {\\\\rm\\ncn}_{l}^{\\\\mathcal{G}}(H) \\\\geq {\\\\rm cn}_{f}^{\\\\mathcal{G}}(H) \\\\] and in general\\neach inequality can be arbitrarily far apart. We investigate structural\\nproperties of graph classes $\\\\mathcal G$ and $\\\\mathcal H$ such that for all\\ngraphs $H \\\\in \\\\mathcal{H}$, a larger $\\\\mathcal G$-covering number of $H$ can be\\nbounded in terms of a smaller $\\\\mathcal G$-covering number of $H$. For example,\\nwe prove that if $\\\\mathcal G$ is hereditary and the chromatic number of graphs\\nin $\\\\mathcal H$ is bounded, then there exists a function $f$ (called a binding\\nfunction) such that for all $H \\\\in \\\\mathcal{H}$ it holds ${\\\\rm\\ncn}_{u}^{\\\\mathcal{G}}(H) \\\\leq f({\\\\rm cn}_{g}^{\\\\mathcal{G}}(H))$.\\n  For $\\\\mathcal G$ we consider graph classes that are component-closed,\\nhereditary, monotone, sparse, or of bounded chromatic number. For $\\\\mathcal H$\\nwe consider graph classes that are sparse, $M$-minor-free, of bounded chromatic\\nnumber, or of bounded treewidth. For each combination and every pair of\\n$\\\\mathcal G$-covering numbers, we either give a binding function $f$ or provide\\nan example of such $\\\\mathcal{G},\\\\mathcal{H}$ for which no binding function\\nexists.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,cs.DM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T11:43:53Z\"}"}
