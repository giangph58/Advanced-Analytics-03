Conversely we\\ndeduced the general terms of balancing, cobalancing, Lucas-balancing and\\nLucas-cobalancing numbers in terms of these numbers. We also deduced some\\nrelations on Binet formulas, recurrence relations, relationship with Pell,\\nPell-Lucas, triangular, square triangular numbers, Pythagorean triples and\\nCassini identities. We also formulate the sum of first $n$-terms of these\\nnumbers and obtained some formulas for the sums of Pell, Pell-Lucas, balancing\\nand Lucas-cobalancing numbers in terms of these numbers.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T12:04:32Z\"}"}
