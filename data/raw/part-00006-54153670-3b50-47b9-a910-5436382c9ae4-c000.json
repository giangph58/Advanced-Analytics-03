{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20601v1\", \"title\": \"How to turn a Supernova into a PeVatron\", \"summary\": \"Context. It is important to determine which Galactic cosmic-ray sources can\\naccelerate particles to the knee of the cosmic ray spectrum at a few PeV, and\\nin particular whether supernova remnants may contribute. Current models for\\nparticle acceleration in very young remnants assume the circumstellar material\\nconsists of smooth, freely expanding winds. There is strong evidence that some\\nsupernovae expand into much denser circumstellar material including dense\\nshells ejected by eruptions shortly before explosion.\\n  Aims. We investigate the effects of dense circumstellar shells on particle\\nacceleration in supernova shocks during the first few years post-explosion, to\\nquantify whether such interaction supernovae may act as PeVatrons.\\n  Methods. We used the pion code to model the circumstellar medium around\\nLuminous Blue Variables after having a brief episode with a mass-loss rate of\\nup to dM/dt = 2Msol/yr. Consequently, we performed spherically symmetric 1-D\\nsimulations using our time-dependent acceleration-code RATPaC in which we\\nsimultaneously solve the transport equations for cosmic-rays, magnetic\\nturbulence, and the hydrodynamical flow of the thermal plasma in the\\ntest-particle limit.\\n  Results. We find that the interaction with the circumstellar shells can\\nsignificantly boost the maximum energy by enhancing particle escape during the\\nonset of the shock-shell interaction followed by the reacceleration of the\\nshock propagating into a medium with a pre-amplified field. Early interactions\\nboost the maximum energy to a greater degree and interactions within the first\\n5 months after explosion can increase Emax to more then 1 PeV.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T10:08:32Z\"}"}
