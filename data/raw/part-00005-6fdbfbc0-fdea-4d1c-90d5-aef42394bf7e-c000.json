{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01923v1\", \"title\": \"Sliding Dynamics of Skyrmion Molecular Crystals\", \"summary\": \"Using both atomistic and particle-based simulations, we investigate the\\ncurrent-driven dynamics of skyrmions on two-dimensional periodic substrates\\nwhen there are multiple skyrmions per substrate minimum. At zero drive, the\\nsystem forms pinned skyrmion molecular crystal states consisting of dimers,\\ntrimers, or dimer-trimer mixtures that have both positional and orientational\\norder. On a square substrate lattice, the motion above depinning occurs via a\\nrunning soliton that travels completely transverse to the applied current. This\\nmotion is generated by a torque from the Magnus force, which rotates the\\n$n$-mer states perpendicular to the applied current. At higher drives, the flow\\nbecomes disordered while the Hall angle diminishes and gradually approaches the\\nintrinsic value. In some cases, we also find directional locking where the Hall\\nangle becomes locked to certain symmetry directions of the substrate over a\\nrange of currents. The transitions into and out of directionally locked states\\nare accompanied by negative differential mobility in which the net velocity\\ndecreases as the drive increases. On a triangular substrate, we find no\\ntransverse mobility effects, but still observe directionally locked motion.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T17:33:12Z\"}"}
