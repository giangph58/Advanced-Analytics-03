The main objective of this\\npaper is to develop a parametric identification strategy that delivers accurate\\nand physically relevant models of multivariable systems using time-domain data.\\nThe introduced approach adopts an additive model structure, offering a\\nparsimonious and interpretable representation of many physical systems, and\\nemploys a refined instrumental variable-based estimation algorithm. The\\ndeveloped identification method enables the estimation of parametric\\ncontinuous-time additive models and is applicable to both open and closed-loop\\ncontrolled systems. The performance of the estimator is demonstrated through\\nnumerical simulations and experimentally validated on a flexible beam system.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:43:38Z\"}"}
