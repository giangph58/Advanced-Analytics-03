{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24316v1\", \"title\": \"Structure and Fragmentation Scale of a Massive Star-Forming Filament in\\n  NGC6334: High-Resolution Mid-Infrared Absorption Imaging with JWST\", \"summary\": \"Dense filaments are believed to be representative of the initial conditions\\nof star formation in molecular clouds. We have used the MIRI instrument on JWST\\nto image the massive filament NGC6334M at d~1.3 kpc with unprecedented\\nresolution and dynamic range at 7.7 and 25.5 microns. Our observations reveal\\nthe fine structure of the filament in absorption against mid-infrared\\nbackground emission. From the absorption data, we derive high-resolution column\\ndensity maps and perform a detailed analysis of the filament structure. We find\\na median filament width of 0.12+/-0.02 pc at both wavelengths, resolved by\\nalmost two orders of magnitude by MIRI, and consistent with the typical\\nhalf-power width of Herschel filaments in nearby (d<0.5 kpc) clouds. The JWST\\ndata also reveal the presence of a quasi-periodic series of side filaments with\\na similar projected spacing of 0.125+/-0.015 pc. Combining our JWST results\\nwith Spitzer and APEX/Herschel data, we perform a study of cloud structure over\\nfour orders of magnitude in linear scale. A convergence test shows that our\\nwidth estimates for NGC6334M are robust and reflect the presence of a true\\ncharacteristic scale. While there is evidence of a Kolmogorov-like spectrum of\\nsmall-scale fluctuations down the 1.6x10^-3 pc resolution of the JWST\\nobservations, we identify a break in the power spectrum of column density\\nfluctuations at a scale ~0.1-0.4 pc comparable to the width of NGC6334M and its\\nside filaments. This characteristic scale ~0.1pc has important implications for\\nthe origin of the star formation efficiency in dense gas and the IMF.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:06:35Z\"}"}
