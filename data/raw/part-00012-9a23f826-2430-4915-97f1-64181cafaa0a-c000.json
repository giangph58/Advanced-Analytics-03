This enables us to bypass the\\nExtended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD)-based system identification step in\\nconventional Koopman-based methods and design controllers for nonlinear systems\\ndirectly from data. Leveraging this result, we develop a Data-Enabled\\nPredictive Control (DeePC) framework for nonlinear systems with unknown\\ndynamics. A case study demonstrates that our direct data-driven control method\\nachieves improved optimality compared to conventional Koopman-based methods.\\nFurthermore, in examples where an exact Koopman realization with a\\nfinite-dimensional lifting function set of the controlled nonlinear system does\\nnot exist, our method exhibits advanced robustness to finite Koopman\\napproximation errors compared to existing methods.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T09:14:11Z\"}"}
