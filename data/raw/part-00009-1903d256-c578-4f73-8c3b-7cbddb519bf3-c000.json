Here, we analyse five such\\ntriple-mode HADS observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)\\nand report that the previously considered second overtone mode ($f_2$) is\\nactually the non-radial component of a resonating integration mode (RI mode,\\nresulting from resonance between a radial p-mode and a non-radial p-g mixed\\nmode), which shows significant amplitude and frequency variations over short\\ntimescales (approximately 20 days). This RI mode appears to be widespread among\\nthese stars. Notably, all five stars are in the post-main sequence evolutionary\\nphase, actively crossing the Hertzsprung gap. These stars offer valuable\\ninsights into stellar evolution during the Hertzsprung gap, which is one of the\\nmost rapid evolutionary stages in a star's life.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:59:23Z\"}"}
