{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19846v1\", \"title\": \"Clustering-based Recurrent Neural Network Controller synthesis under\\n  Signal Temporal Logic Specifications\", \"summary\": \"Autonomous robotic systems require advanced control frameworks to achieve\\ncomplex temporal objectives that extend beyond conventional stability and\\ntrajectory tracking. Signal Temporal Logic (STL) provides a formal framework\\nfor specifying such objectives, with robustness metrics widely employed for\\ncontrol synthesis. Existing optimization-based approaches using neural network\\n(NN)-based controllers often rely on a single NN for both learning and control.\\nHowever, variations in initial states and obstacle configurations can lead to\\ndiscontinuous changes in the optimization solution, thereby degrading\\ngeneralization and control performance. To address this issue, this study\\nproposes a method to enhance recurrent neural network (RNN)-based control by\\nclustering solution trajectories that satisfy STL specifications under diverse\\ninitial conditions. The proposed approach utilizes trajectory similarity\\nmetrics to generate clustering labels, which are subsequently used to train a\\nclassification network. This network assigns new initial states and obstacle\\nconfigurations to the appropriate cluster, enabling the selection of a\\nspecialized controller. By explicitly accounting for variations in solution\\ntrajectories, the proposed method improves both estimation accuracy and control\\nperformance. Numerical experiments on a dynamic vehicle path planning problem\\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:44:58Z\"}"}
