By\\ngeneralizing Bapat et al.'s nonsingular substructure theory and by defining\\nsubstructures as vertex-edge pairs $(V',E')$ which allows edges to connect\\nvertices outside $V'$, we establish a link between the principle minors and the\\ntopological properties of key substructures such as rootless trees and\\nunicyclic graphs. Using the Cauchy-Binet formula, we decompose principal minors\\ninto sums of determinants of regular substructures. Specifically, we\\ninvestigate how these algebraic invariants encode information about unicyclic\\nsubstructures and their properties, contributing to the broader understanding\\nof graph structures through the lens of Hermitian Laplacian matrix of algebraic\\ngraph theory.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T13:46:14Z\"}"}
