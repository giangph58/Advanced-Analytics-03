{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11045v1\", \"title\": \"Neural Control Barrier Functions from Physics Informed Neural Networks\", \"summary\": \"As autonomous systems become increasingly prevalent in daily life, ensuring\\ntheir safety is paramount. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have emerged as an\\neffective tool for guaranteeing safety; however, manually designing them for\\nspecific applications remains a significant challenge. With the advent of deep\\nlearning techniques, recent research has explored synthesizing CBFs using\\nneural networks-commonly referred to as neural CBFs. This paper introduces a\\nnovel class of neural CBFs that leverages a physics-inspired neural network\\nframework by incorporating Zubov's Partial Differential Equation (PDE) within\\nthe context of safety. This approach provides a scalable methodology for\\nsynthesizing neural CBFs applicable to high-dimensional systems. Furthermore,\\nby utilizing reciprocal CBFs instead of zeroing CBFs, the proposed framework\\nallows for the specification of flexible, user-defined safe regions. To\\nvalidate the effectiveness of the approach, we present case studies on three\\ndifferent systems: an inverted pendulum, autonomous ground navigation, and\\naerial navigation in obstacle-laden environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T10:13:30Z\"}"}
