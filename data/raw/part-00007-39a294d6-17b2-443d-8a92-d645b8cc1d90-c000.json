{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16428v1\", \"title\": \"Energy Rates Due to Weak Decay Rates of Vanadium Isotopes in Stellar\\n  Environment\", \"summary\": \"The neutrino cooling and gamma heating rates are considered as an important\\ninput needed to study the final phases of the evolution of high-mass stars. The\\nweak-interaction mediated processes, namely the $\\\\beta$-decay and electron\\ncapture, significantly change the lepton to baryon ratio and accelerate the\\ncontraction of the core. The emission of resulting neutrinos/antineutrinos\\ntends to cool the stellar core. On the other hand, gamma rays are produced\\nbecause of electron capture and $\\\\beta$-decay to excited states in daughter\\nnuclei. These gamma rays heat the core and contribute to an increase of entropy\\nwhich may cause convection to occur.\\n  In the present work, the weak-interaction heating and cooling rates on a\\nchain of twenty-two isotopes of vanadium having mass in the range $43-64$ have\\nbeen estimated using the proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase\\napproximation theory. The rates have been computed for the temperature ranging\\nfrom ($10^{7} - 3 \\\\times 10^{10}$)\\\\;K and for the density range\\n($10-10^{11}$)\\\\;g/cm$^{3}$. Our calculated neutrino energy loss rates have also\\nbeen compared with the previously reported rates calculated using other\\ntheoretical models. At high stellar temperatures, our rates are larger by 1-2\\norders of magnitude as compared to previous results.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T05:25:42Z\"}"}
