More specifically, we evaluate two different variants of the\\nalgorithm. In the first approach, we combine the evolutionary algorithm with an\\noptimization subroutine to optimize the parameters of the rotation gates\\npresent in the quantum circuit. In the second, the algorithm solely relies on\\nevolutionary operations (i.e., mutations and crossover). We approach the\\nproblem from two sides: (1) constructing circuits from the ground up by\\nstarting with random initializations and (2) initializing individuals with a\\ntarget circuit in order to optimize it further according to the fitness\\nfunction. We run experiments on random circuits with 4 and 6 qubits varying in\\ncircuit depth. Our results show that the proposed methods are able to\\nsignificantly reduce the depth of circuits while still retaining a high\\nfidelity to the target state.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T13:54:22Z\"}"}
