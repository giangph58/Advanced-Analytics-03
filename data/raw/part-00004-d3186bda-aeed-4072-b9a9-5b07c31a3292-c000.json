{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12944v1\", \"title\": \"A Bi-Objective MDP Design approach to redundancy allocation with dynamic\\n  maintenance for a parallel system\", \"summary\": \"The reliability of a system can be improved by the addition of redundant\\nelements, giving rise to the well-known redundancy allocation problem (RAP),\\nwhich can be seen as a design problem. We propose a novel extension to the RAP\\ncalled the Bi-Objective Integrated Design and Dynamic Maintenance Problem\\n(BO-IDDMP) which allows for future dynamic maintenance decisions to be\\nincorporated. This leads to a problem with first-stage redundancy design\\ndecisions and a second-stage sequential decision problem. To the best of our\\nknowledge, this is the first use of a continuous-time Markov Decision Process\\nDesign framework to formulate a problem with non-trivial dynamics, as well as\\nits first use alongside bi-objective optimization. A general heuristic\\noptimization methodology for two-stage bi-objective programmes is developed,\\nwhich is then applied to the BO-IDDMP. The efficiency and accuracy of our\\nmethodology are demonstrated against an exact optimization formulation. The\\nheuristic is shown to be orders of magnitude faster, and in only 2 out of 42\\ncases fails to find one of the Pareto-optimal solutions found by the exact\\nmethod. The inclusion of dynamic maintenance policies is shown to yield\\nstronger and better-populated Pareto fronts, allowing more flexibility for the\\ndecision-maker. The impacts of varying parameters unique to our problem are\\nalso investigated.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T13:45:14Z\"}"}
