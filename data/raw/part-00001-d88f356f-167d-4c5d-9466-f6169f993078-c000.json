In this paper, we mathematically formulate SCFTs using\\nunitary full vertex operator superalgebras (full VOAs) and develop a cohomology\\ntheory of unitary SCFTs (aka holomorphic / topological twists). In particular,\\nwe introduce cohomology rings, Hodge numbers, and the Witten index of a unitary\\n$N=(2,2)$ full VOA, and prove that the cohomology rings determine 2d\\ntopological field theories and give relations between them (Hodge duality and\\nT-duality).\\n  Based on this, we propose a possible approach to prove the existence of\\nmirror Calabi-Yau manifolds for the Hodge numbers using SCFTs. For the proof,\\none need a construction of sigma models connecting Calabi-Yau manifolds and\\nSCFTs which is still not rigorous, but expected properties are tested for the\\ncase of Abelian varieties and a special K3 surface based on some unitary\\n$N=(2,2)$ full VOAs.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RT\", \"categories\": \"math.RT,math-ph,math.AG,math.CV,math.MP,math.QA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T06:27:03Z\"}"}
