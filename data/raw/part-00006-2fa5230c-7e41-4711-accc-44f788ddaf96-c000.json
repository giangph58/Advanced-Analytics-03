Over\\narithmetic fields, we use Severi-Brauer fibrations to produce examples where\\nthe map is not surjective. For varieties X over the complex field, we discuss\\nthe question after extension of the complex field to function fields of\\nvarieties. This is related to C. Voisin's notion of universal zero-cycle and to\\nrationality questions for rationally connected threefolds.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T15:11:41Z\"}"}
