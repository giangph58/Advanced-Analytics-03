We here consider the case of multi-output Gaussian\\nprocesses (MOGP) and present low-rank approaches for efficiently computing the\\nposterior mean of a MOGP. Starting from low-rank spatio-temporal data we\\nconsider a structured covariance function, assuming separability across space\\nand time. This separability, in turn, gives a decomposition of the covariance\\nmatrix into a Kronecker product of individual covariance matrices.\\nIncorporating the typical noise term to the model then requires the solution of\\na large-scale Stein equation for computing the posterior mean. For this, we\\npropose efficient low-rank methods based on a combination of a LRPCG method\\nwith the Sylvester equation solver KPIK adjusted for solving Stein equations.\\nWe test the developed method on real world street network graphs by using graph\\nfilters as covariance matrices. Moreover, we propose a degree-weighted average\\ncovariance matrix, which can be employed under specific assumptions to achieve\\nmore efficient convergence.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.LG,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T11:19:58Z\"}"}
