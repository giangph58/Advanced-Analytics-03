{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20624v1\", \"title\": \"PaRT: Enhancing Proactive Social Chatbots with Personalized Real-Time\\n  Retrieval\", \"summary\": \"Social chatbots have become essential intelligent companions in daily\\nscenarios ranging from emotional support to personal interaction. However,\\nconventional chatbots with passive response mechanisms usually rely on users to\\ninitiate or sustain dialogues by bringing up new topics, resulting in\\ndiminished engagement and shortened dialogue duration. In this paper, we\\npresent PaRT, a novel framework enabling context-aware proactive dialogues for\\nsocial chatbots through personalized real-time retrieval and generation.\\nSpecifically, PaRT first integrates user profiles and dialogue context into a\\nlarge language model (LLM), which is initially prompted to refine user queries\\nand recognize their underlying intents for the upcoming conversation. Guided by\\nrefined intents, the LLM generates personalized dialogue topics, which then\\nserve as targeted queries to retrieve relevant passages from RedNote. Finally,\\nwe prompt LLMs with summarized passages to generate knowledge-grounded and\\nengagement-optimized responses. Our approach has been running stably in a\\nreal-world production environment for more than 30 days, achieving a 21.77\\\\%\\nimprovement in the average duration of dialogues.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T10:51:58Z\"}"}
