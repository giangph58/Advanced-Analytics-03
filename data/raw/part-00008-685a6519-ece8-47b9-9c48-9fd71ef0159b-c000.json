SDs are typically monitored through invasive, high-frequency\\nelectrocorticography (ECoG); however, detection remains challenging due to\\nsignal artifacts that obscure critical SD-related electrophysiological changes,\\nsuch as power attenuation and DC drifting. Recent studies suggest spectrogram\\nanalysis could improve SD detection; however, brain injury patients often show\\npower reduction across all bands except delta, causing class imbalance.\\nPrevious methods focusing solely on delta mitigates imbalance but overlooks\\nfeatures in other frequencies, limiting detection performance. This study\\nexplores using multi-frequency spectrogram analysis, revealing that essential\\nSD-related features span multiple frequency bands beyond the most active delta\\nband. This study demonstrated that further integration of both alpha and delta\\nbands could result in enhanced SD detection accuracy by a deep learning model.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T17:17:15Z\"}"}
