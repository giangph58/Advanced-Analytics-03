We demonstrate that as the thickness of these transition layers\\napproaches zero, the conventional sharp interface model with interfacial\\nboundary conditions, commonly adopted by the fluids community, is recovered\\nunder the assumption of constant porosity. Our results validate the widely used\\nsharp interface model by bridging it with the more physically realistic case of\\ndiffused material interfaces. This limiting process is singular and involves a\\nboundary layer in the velocity field.
