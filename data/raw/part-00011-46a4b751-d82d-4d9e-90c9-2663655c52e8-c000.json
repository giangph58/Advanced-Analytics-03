Inspired by human cognitive processes, we propose Hierarchical\\nAttention Fusion of Visual and Textual Representations (HAF-VT), a novel\\napproach integrating visual and textual data to enhance cognitive modeling.\\nUsing the frozen CLIP model, we generate image and text embeddings, enriching\\nitem representations with multimodal data. A hierarchical attention mechanism\\njointly learns single-domain and cross-domain preferences, mimicking human\\ninformation integration. Evaluated on four e-commerce datasets, HAF-VT\\noutperforms existing methods in capturing cross-domain user interests, bridging\\ncognitive principles with computational models and highlighting the role of\\nmultimodal data in sequential decision-making.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T13:18:54Z\"}"}
