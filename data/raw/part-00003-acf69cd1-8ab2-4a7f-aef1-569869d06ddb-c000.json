Here, we demonstrate the\\nelectrical generation of unconventional orbital currents in ferro-rotational\\nsystems through an intrinsic, nonrelativistic mechanism associated with an\\nelectric hexadecapole moment. These rotation-induced orbital currents are\\nexamined using tight-binding models, and we also provide first-principles\\ncalculations for the ferro-rotational material TiAu$_4$. Our findings unveil a\\nnovel pathway for generating orbital currents beyond the conventional orbital\\nHall effect, broadening the landscape of orbitronics research to include novel\\nferroic materials and higher-order electric multipoles.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T12:29:53Z\"}"}
