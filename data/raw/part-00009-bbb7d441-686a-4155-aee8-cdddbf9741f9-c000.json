Here, as an application\\nof artificial intelligence (AI), computer vision, and robotics, we explore how\\na blimp could be designed as a kind of \\\"floating camera\\\" to drift over and\\nrecord evidence with minimal disturbance. In particular, rapid prototyping is\\nused to develop a proof-of-concept to gain insight into what such blimps could\\ndo, manually piloted or semi-autonomously. As a result, we show the feasibility\\nof attaching various components to an indoor blimp, and confirm our basic\\npremise, that blimps can sense evidence without producing much wind. Some\\nadditional suggestions--regarding mapping, sensing, and path-finding--aim to\\nstimulate the flow of ideas for further exploration.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T15:01:10Z\"}"}
