Whilst well-known shock tracers such as SiO can be used to study the\\njet properties and give information about the dynamics of the system,\\ninterstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMs) have been useful in constraining\\nthe age of shocked gas, for example. Yet, the number of outflows mapped in\\niCOMs is still limited. In this work, we study the outflow driven by the\\nprotostar FIR6c-a (HOPS 409) located in the OMC-2/3 filament. We report the\\ndetection of the red-shifted jet, left undetected in previous studies, as well\\nas the detection of the iCOMs methanol (CH$_3$OH) and methyl cyanide (CH$_3$CN)\\nfor the first time towards this outflow. Using SiO, we derived some jet\\nproperties (i.e., collimation and dynamical time). We found a clear dichotomy\\nbetween the blue- and red-shifted jets, likely due to the density of the medium\\nin which the jets propagate. In addition, we identified two bow shocks within\\nthe blue-shifted part of the outflow, which we attribute to two different\\nejection events. Finally, using the CH$_3$OH} and \\\\ce{CH$_3$CN} abundance ratio\\nand chemical modelling, we constrained the outflow age to be $\\\\geq 1000$ yr old\\nand, surprisingly, found that a cosmic-ray ionization rate of $10^{-14}$\\ns$^{-1}$ is needed to reproduce the observed ratio towards the source.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T11:42:54Z\"}"}
