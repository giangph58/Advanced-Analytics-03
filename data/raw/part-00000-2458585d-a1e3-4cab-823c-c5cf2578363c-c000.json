{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19487v1\", \"title\": \"Evolution of Cooperation in LLM-Agent Societies: A Preliminary Study\\n  Using Different Punishment Strategies\", \"summary\": \"The evolution of cooperation has been extensively studied using abstract\\nmathematical models and simulations. Recent advances in Large Language Models\\n(LLM) and the rise of LLM agents have demonstrated their ability to perform\\nsocial reasoning, thus providing an opportunity to test the emergence of norms\\nin more realistic agent-based simulations with human-like reasoning using\\nnatural language. In this research, we investigate whether the cooperation\\ndynamics presented in Boyd and Richerson's model persist in a more realistic\\nsimulation of the diner's dilemma using LLM agents compared to the abstract\\nmathematical nature in the work of Boyd and Richerson. Our findings indicate\\nthat agents follow the strategies defined in the Boyd and Richerson model, and\\nexplicit punishment mechanisms drive norm emergence, reinforcing cooperative\\nbehaviour even when the agent strategy configuration varies. Our results\\nsuggest that LLM-based Multi-Agent System simulations, in fact, can replicate\\nthe evolution of cooperation predicted by the traditional mathematical models.\\nMoreover, our simulations extend beyond the mathematical models by integrating\\nnatural language-driven reasoning and a pairwise imitation method for strategy\\nadoption, making them a more realistic testbed for cooperative behaviour in\\nMASs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MA\", \"categories\": \"cs.MA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T05:07:55Z\"}"}
