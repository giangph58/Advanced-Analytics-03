However, roadside point cloud oriented 3D object detection has\\nnot been effectively explored. To some extent, the key to the performance of a\\npoint cloud detector lies in the receptive field of the network and the ability\\nto effectively utilize the scene context. The recent emergence of Mamba, based\\non State Space Model (SSM), has shaken up the traditional convolution and\\ntransformers that have long been the foundational building blocks, due to its\\nefficient global receptive field. In this work, we introduce Mamba to\\npillar-based roadside point cloud perception and propose a framework based on\\nCross-stage State-space Group (CSG), called PillarMamba. It enhances the\\nexpressiveness of the network and achieves efficient computation through\\ncross-stage feature fusion. However, due to the limitations of scan directions,\\nstate space model faces local connection disrupted and historical relationship\\nforgotten. To address this, we propose the Hybrid State-space Block (HSB) to\\nobtain the local-global context of roadside point cloud. Specifically, it\\nenhances neighborhood connections through local convolution and preserves\\nhistorical memory through residual attention. The proposed method outperforms\\nthe state-of-the-art methods on the popular large scale roadside benchmark:\\nDAIR-V2X-I. The code will be released soon.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T16:33:04Z\"}"}
