The paper [19] by Nadji et al. looked into congruences modulo $3$ and\\npowers of $2$ for certain specific pairs of co-prime integers, while the paper\\n[1] by Alanazi et al. investigated some congruences related to some similar and\\nsome different pairs of co-prime integers. In this paper we propose some\\nelegant and elementary proofs of a subset of the congruences given in [1] by\\nusing only theta function and dissection identities. We also propose a generic\\nmethod for proving congruences modulo $8$ which doesn't necessarily use any\\nspecific $2$-dissection.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T08:55:25Z\"}"}
