The present study performs large eddy\\nsimulations (LES) of the dilute auto-igniting methanol flame in a vitiated, hot\\ncoflow of varying swirl intensities. The six-dimensional Flamelet Generated\\nManifold (FGM) technique is used to solve the reactive flow accurately and\\neconomically. The swirl numbers (SN), i.e. 0.2, 0.6, 1.0, and 1.4, are used to\\nassess their effect on auto-ignition and flame stability. At lower to moderate\\nswirl numbers (SN =0.2, 0.6), the increase in swirl is found to increase the\\nlift-off height. Beyond the critical swirl number (SN=0.6), the lift-off height\\ndrops. Also, the time-averaged flame structure transitions from a tubular-like\\nflame into a uniformly distributed combustion region at these high swirl\\nnumbers. It also results in a more compact flame for the higher swirl numbers.\\nThese effects on flame dynamics are analyzed in detail using the mean gas-phase\\nflow field distribution, particle statistics, and proper orthogonal\\ndecomposition (POD).\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T03:26:37Z\"}"}
