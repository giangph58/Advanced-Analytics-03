{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11861v1\", \"title\": \"Visualization Analysis and Impedance Analysis for the Aging Behavior\\n  Assessment of 18650 Cells\", \"summary\": \"This work presents a comprehensive study on the aging behavior of 18650-type\\nlithium-ion batteries, focusing on the uneven intercalation of lithium ions\\nduring fast charging processes. It introduces a novel approach using color\\nvisual recognition technology to analyze color changes in the graphite anode,\\nindicative of lithiation levels. The study employs X-ray diffraction (XRD) and\\nDistribution of Relaxation Time (DRT) techniques to validate and analyze the\\nobservations. The study emphasizes the significance of electrode impedance, the\\npositioning of battery tabs, and electrolyte distribution in influencing the\\naging dynamics of lithium-ion batteries. Furthermore, the paper presents an\\ninnovative impedance Transport-Line Model, specifically developed to capture\\nthe evolution of polarization impedance over time. This model offers a deeper\\nunderstanding of the internal mechanisms driving battery aging, providing\\nvaluable insights for the design and optimization of lithium-ion batteries. The\\nresearch represents a significant contribution to the field, shedding light on\\nthe complex aging processes in lithium-ion batteries, particularly under the\\nconditions of fast charging. This could lead to improved battery performance,\\nlongevity, and safety, which are critical for the wide range of applications\\nthat depend on these energy storage systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T08:31:27Z\"}"}
