{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04945v1\", \"title\": \"Superconductivity in Spin-Orbit coupled SU(8) Dirac Fermions on\\n  Honeycomb lattice\", \"summary\": \"We study superconducting (SC) phases that are naturally proximate to a\\nspin-orbit coupled SU(8) Dirac semi-metal on a honeycomb lattice. This system,\\nwhich offers enhanced low-energy symmetries, presents an interesting platform\\nfor realizing unconventional superconductivity in j=3/2 electrons. In\\nparticular, we find 72 superconducting charge-$2e$ fermion bilinears which,\\nunder classification of microscopic symmetries, lead to 12 different SCs --\\nfour singlets, two doublets, and six triplets -- 7 of them are gapped and 5 are\\nsymmetry-protected nodal SCs. The strong spin-orbit coupling leads to locking\\nof the spin of the Cooper pairs with real-space direction -- as is evident from\\nthe structure of the Cooper pair wave-functions -- leading to unusual\\nnon-unitary superconductors (even singlets), and with finite momentum pairing\\n(for the triplets). This results, in many cases, in the magnitude of multiple\\npairing gaps being intricately dependent on the direction of the SC\\norder-parameter. The present classification of SCs along with normal phases\\n(Phys. Rev. B 108, 245106 (2023)) provides the complete list of naturally\\noccurring phases in the vicinity of such a SU(8) Dirac semi-metal. This study\\nallows for understanding the global phase diagram of such systems, stimulating\\nfurther experimental work on candidate materials such as metallic halides\\n(MX$_3$ with M=Zr, Hf, and X=Cl, Br). Further, it provides the starting point\\nfor the exploration of unconventional phase transitions in such systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.supr-con,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T04:49:32Z\"}"}
