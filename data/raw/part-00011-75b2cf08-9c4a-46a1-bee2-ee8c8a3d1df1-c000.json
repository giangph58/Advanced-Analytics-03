{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03470v1\", \"title\": \"Blending 3D Geometry and Machine Learning for Multi-View Stereopsis\", \"summary\": \"Traditional multi-view stereo (MVS) methods primarily depend on photometric\\nand geometric consistency constraints. In contrast, modern learning-based\\nalgorithms often rely on the plane sweep algorithm to infer 3D geometry,\\napplying explicit geometric consistency (GC) checks only as a post-processing\\nstep, with no impact on the learning process itself. In this work, we introduce\\nGC MVSNet plus plus, a novel approach that actively enforces geometric\\nconsistency of reference view depth maps across multiple source views (multi\\nview) and at various scales (multi scale) during the learning phase (see Fig.\\n1). This integrated GC check significantly accelerates the learning process by\\ndirectly penalizing geometrically inconsistent pixels, effectively halving the\\nnumber of training iterations compared to other MVS methods. Furthermore, we\\nintroduce a densely connected cost regularization network with two distinct\\nblock designs simple and feature dense optimized to harness dense feature\\nconnections for enhanced regularization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\\nour approach achieves a new state of the art on the DTU and BlendedMVS datasets\\nand secures second place on the Tanks and Temples benchmark. To our knowledge,\\nGC MVSNet plus plus is the first method to enforce multi-view, multi-scale\\nsupervised geometric consistency during learning. Our code is available.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI,cs.CG,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T12:22:45Z\"}"}
