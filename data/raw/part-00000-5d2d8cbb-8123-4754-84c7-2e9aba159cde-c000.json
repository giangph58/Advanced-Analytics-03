{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17579v1\", \"title\": \"THz Emission from Spintronic Microstructure\", \"summary\": \"Recent advancements in spintronics have opened a new avenue in terahertz\\n(THz) radiation sources that may outperform the traditional contact-based\\nmetallic counterparts. Inspired by the generation of broadband spintronic THz\\nsignals at the interface of a ferromagnet and ultrawide bandgap semiconductors,\\nhere we investigated the generation of THz radiation from micro-structured\\nheterostructures of a metallic ferromagnet (Ni80Fe20) and an ultrawide bandgap\\nsemiconductor (AlGaN/GaN) that contains a layer of 2D electron gas. By\\nprecisely tailoring the dimension of the subwavelength pillars of a THz device,\\nthe micro-structured spintronic THz emitter can achieve up to more than three\\ntimes higher emission intensity compared to that of the un-patterned\\ncounterpart. Our study advances the development of the next generation of\\nspintronic THz sources that allow a tailored emission frequency and intensity\\ncontrol and, further, are compatible with existing integrated wide-bandgap\\nsemiconductor circuits.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:09:43Z\"}"}
