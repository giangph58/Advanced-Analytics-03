We derive upper bounds on the PIR capacity for such systems and\\nconstruct PIR schemes that approach these bounds. For graph-based systems, we\\ndetermine the exact PIR capacity for path graphs and improve upon existing\\nresults for complete bipartite graphs and complete graphs. For multigraph-based\\nsystems, we propose a PIR scheme that leverages the symmetry of the underlying\\ngraph-based construction, yielding a capacity lower bound for such multigraphs.\\nFurthermore, we establish several general upper and lower bounds on the PIR\\ncapacity of multigraphs, which are tight in certain cases.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,cs.CR,math.CO,math.IT,H.3.3\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T16:05:42Z\"}"}
