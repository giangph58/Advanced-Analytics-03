The complexity bound for finding an approximate minimizer with a\\ndistance to the true minimizer less than $\\\\varepsilon$ is $O(\\\\log\\n(\\\\varepsilon^{-1}) \\\\varepsilon^{2 \\\\alpha - 2})$, which extends the well-known\\ncomplexity result for $\\\\alpha = 1$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T13:15:07Z\"}"}
