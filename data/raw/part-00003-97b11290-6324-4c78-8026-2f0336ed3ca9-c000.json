{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17693v1\", \"title\": \"BIM-Constrained Optimization for Accurate Localization and Deviation\\n  Correction in Construction Monitoring\", \"summary\": \"Augmented reality (AR) applications for construction monitoring rely on\\nreal-time environmental tracking to visualize architectural elements. However,\\nconstruction sites present significant challenges for traditional tracking\\nmethods due to featureless surfaces, dynamic changes, and drift accumulation,\\nleading to misalignment between digital models and the physical world. This\\npaper proposes a BIM-aware drift correction method to address these challenges.\\nInstead of relying solely on SLAM-based localization, we align ``as-built\\\"\\ndetected planes from the real-world environment with ``as-planned\\\"\\narchitectural planes in BIM. Our method performs robust plane matching and\\ncomputes a transformation (TF) between SLAM (S) and BIM (B) origin frames using\\noptimization techniques, minimizing drift over time. By incorporating BIM as\\nprior structural knowledge, we can achieve improved long-term localization and\\nenhanced AR visualization accuracy in noisy construction environments. The\\nmethod is evaluated through real-world experiments, showing significant\\nreductions in drift-induced errors and optimized alignment consistency. On\\naverage, our system achieves a reduction of 52.24% in angular deviations and a\\nreduction of 60.8% in the distance error of the matched walls compared to the\\ninitial manual alignment by the user.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T16:02:02Z\"}"}
