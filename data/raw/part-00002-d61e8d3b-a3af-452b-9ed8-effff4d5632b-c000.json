Much of this work focuses on classical problems such\\nas the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Vehicle Routing Problem. The\\npractical applicability of these problems depends on the specific objectives\\nand constraints considered. However, it is undeniable that translating complex\\nreal-world requirements into these classical formulations often proves\\nchallenging. In this paper, we resort to our previously published\\nquantum-classical technique for addressing real-world-oriented routing\\nproblems, known as Quantum for Real Package Delivery (Q4RPD), and elaborate on\\nsolving additional realistic problem instances. Accordingly, this paper\\nemphasizes the following characteristics: i) simultaneous pickup and\\ndeliveries, ii) time-windows, and iii) mobility restrictions by vehicle type.\\nTo illustrate the application of Q4RPD, we have conducted an experimentation\\ncomprising seven instances, serving as a demonstration of the newly developed\\nfeatures.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.ET\", \"categories\": \"cs.ET,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T10:01:34Z\"}"}
