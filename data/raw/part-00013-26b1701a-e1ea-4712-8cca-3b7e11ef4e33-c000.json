This function, however,\\ndoes not satisfy the deletion-contraction property, which is a very powerful\\ntool for proving various identities using induction. In this paper, we\\nintroduce an analogue of this function in noncommuting variables which does\\nhave such property. Furthermore, it specializes to the ordinary Redei-Berge\\nfunction when the variables are allowed to commute. This modification allows us\\nto further generalize properties that are already proved for the original\\nfunction and to deduce many new ones.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:37:44Z\"}"}
