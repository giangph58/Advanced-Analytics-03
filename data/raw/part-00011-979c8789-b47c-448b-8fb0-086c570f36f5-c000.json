{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13126v1\", \"title\": \"A hybrid U-Net and Fourier neural operator framework for the large-eddy\\n  simulation of turbulent flows over periodic hills\", \"summary\": \"Accurate and efficient predictions of three-dimensional (3D) turbulent flows\\nare of significant importance in the fields of science and engineering. In the\\ncurrent work, we propose a hybrid U-Net and Fourier neural operator (HUFNO)\\nmethod, tailored for mixed periodic and non-periodic boundary conditions which\\nare often encountered in complex turbulence problems. The HUFNO model is tested\\nin the large-eddy simulation (LES) of 3D periodic hill turbulence featuring\\nstrong flow separations. Compared to the original Fourier neural operator (FNO)\\nand the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based U-Net framework, the HUFNO\\nmodel has a higher accuracy in the predictions of the velocity field and\\nReynolds stresses. Further numerical experiments in the LES show that the HUFNO\\nframework outperforms the traditional Smagorinsky (SMAG) model and the\\nwall-adapted local eddy-viscosity (WALE) model in the predictions of the\\nturbulence statistics, the energy spectrum, the wall stresses and the flow\\nseparation structures, with much lower computational cost. Importantly, the\\naccuracy and efficiency are transferable to unseen initial conditions and hill\\nshapes, underscoring its great potentials for the fast prediction of strongly\\nseparated turbulent flows over curved boundaries.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:43:23Z\"}"}
