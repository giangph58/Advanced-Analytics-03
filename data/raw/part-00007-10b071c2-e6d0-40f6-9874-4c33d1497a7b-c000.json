{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00540v1\", \"title\": \"Emergence of Roles in Robotic Teams with Model Sharing and Limited\\n  Communication\", \"summary\": \"We present a reinforcement learning strategy for use in multi-agent foraging\\nsystems in which the learning is centralised to a single agent and its model is\\nperiodically disseminated among the population of non-learning agents. In a\\ndomain where multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is the common approach,\\nthis approach aims to significantly reduce the computational and energy demands\\ncompared to approaches such as MARL and centralised learning models. By\\ndeveloping high performing foraging agents, these approaches can be translated\\ninto real-world applications such as logistics, environmental monitoring, and\\nautonomous exploration. A reward function was incorporated into this approach\\nthat promotes role development among agents, without explicit directives. This\\nled to the differentiation of behaviours among the agents. The implicit\\nencouragement of role differentiation allows for dynamic actions in which\\nagents can alter roles dependent on their interactions with the environment\\nwithout the need for explicit communication between agents.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MA\", \"categories\": \"cs.MA,cs.LG,cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T14:05:46Z\"}"}
