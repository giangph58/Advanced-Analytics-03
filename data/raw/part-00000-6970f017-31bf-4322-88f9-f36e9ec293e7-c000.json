Compared to\\nArnold's approach, we employ a compactness argument rather than relying on the\\nnegative definiteness of the energy-Casimir functional. The isovortical\\nproperty of the Euler equation and Burton's rearrangement theory play an\\nessential role in our analysis. As a corollary, we prove for the first time the\\nexistence of a class of stable non-shear flows when the ratio of the channel's\\nheight to its length is less than or equal to $\\\\sqrt{3}/2.$ Two rigidity\\nresults are also obtained as byproducts.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T09:04:18Z\"}"}
