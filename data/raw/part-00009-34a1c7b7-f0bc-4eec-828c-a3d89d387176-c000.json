{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07687v1\", \"title\": \"FMNV: A Dataset of Media-Published News Videos for Fake News Detection\", \"summary\": \"News media, particularly video-based platforms, have become deeply embedded\\nin daily life, concurrently amplifying risks of misinformation dissemination.\\nConsequently, multimodal fake news detection has garnered significant research\\nattention. However, existing datasets predominantly comprise user-generated\\nvideos characterized by crude editing and limited public engagement, whereas\\nprofessionally crafted fake news videos disseminated by media outlets often\\npolitically or virally motivated pose substantially greater societal harm. To\\naddress this gap, we construct FMNV, a novel dataset exclusively composed of\\nnews videos published by media organizations. Through empirical analysis of\\nexisting datasets and our curated collection, we categorize fake news videos\\ninto four distinct types. Building upon this taxonomy, we employ Large Language\\nModels (LLMs) to automatically generate deceptive content by manipulating\\nauthentic media-published news videos. Furthermore, we propose FMNVD, a\\nbaseline model featuring a dual-stream architecture integrating CLIP and Faster\\nR-CNN for video feature extraction, enhanced by co-attention mechanisms for\\nfeature refinement and multimodal aggregation. Comparative experiments\\ndemonstrate both the generalization capability of FMNV across multiple\\nbaselines and the superior detection efficacy of FMNVD. This work establishes\\ncritical benchmarks for detecting high-impact fake news in media ecosystems\\nwhile advancing methodologies for cross-modal inconsistency analysis.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.MM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T12:16:32Z\"}"}
