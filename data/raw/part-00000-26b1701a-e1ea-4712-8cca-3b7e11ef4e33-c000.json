{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20955v1\", \"title\": \"Egret-1: Pretrained Neural Network Potentials For Efficient and Accurate\\n  Bioorganic Simulation\", \"summary\": \"Accurate simulation of atomic systems has the potential to revolutionize the\\ndesign of molecules and materials. Unfortunately, exact solutions of the\\nSchr\\\\\\\"odinger equation scale as O(N!) and remain inaccessible for systems with\\nmore than a handful of atoms, forcing scientists to accept steep tradeoffs\\nbetween speed and accuracy and limiting the reliability and utility of the\\nresultant simulations. Recent work in machine learning has demonstrated that\\nneural network potentials (NNPs) can learn efficient approximations to quantum\\nmechanics and resolve this tradeoff, but existing NNPs still suffer from\\nlimited accuracy relative to state-of-the-art quantum-chemical methods. Here,\\nwe present Egret-1, a family of large pre-trained NNPs based on the MACE\\narchitecture with general applicability to main-group, organic, and\\nbiomolecular chemistry. We find that the Egret-1 models equal or exceed the\\naccuracy of routinely employed quantum-chemical methods on a variety of\\nstandard tasks, including torsional scans, conformer ranking, and geometry\\noptimization, while offering multiple-order-of-magnitude speedups relative to\\nlegacy methods. We also highlight important lacunae for future NNP research to\\ninvestigate, and suggest strategies for building future high-quality models\\nwith increased scale and generality.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:26:21Z\"}"}
