{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10248v1\", \"title\": \"Adaptive Sensor Steering Strategy Using Deep Reinforcement Learning for\\n  Dynamic Data Acquisition in Digital Twins\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces a sensor steering methodology based on deep\\nreinforcement learning to enhance the predictive accuracy and decision support\\ncapabilities of digital twins by optimising the data acquisition process.\\nTraditional sensor placement techniques are often constrained by one-off\\noptimisation strategies, which limit their applicability for online\\napplications requiring continuous informative data assimilation. The proposed\\napproach addresses this limitation by offering an adaptive framework for sensor\\nplacement within the digital twin paradigm. The sensor placement problem is\\nformulated as a Markov decision process, enabling the training and deployment\\nof an agent capable of dynamically repositioning sensors in response to the\\nevolving conditions of the physical structure as represented by the digital\\ntwin. This ensures that the digital twin maintains a highly representative and\\nreliable connection to its physical counterpart. The proposed framework is\\nvalidated through a series of comprehensive case studies involving a cantilever\\nplate structure subjected to diverse conditions, including healthy and damaged\\nconditions. The results demonstrate the capability of the deep reinforcement\\nlearning agent to adaptively reposition sensors improving the quality of data\\nacquisition and hence enhancing the overall accuracy of digital twins.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ML\", \"categories\": \"stat.ML,cs.LG,eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T14:11:00Z\"}"}
