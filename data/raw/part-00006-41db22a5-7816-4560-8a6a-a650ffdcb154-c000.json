A co-trapped $^{25}$Mg$^+$ ion provides sympathetic\\ncooling and quantum logic readout of the $^{27}$Al$^+$\\n$^1$S$_0\\\\leftrightarrow^3$P$_0$ clock transition. A Rabi probe duration of 1 s,\\nenabled by laser stability transfer from a remote cryogenic silicon cavity\\nacross a 3.6 km fiber link, results in a threefold reduction in instability\\ncompared to previous $^{27}$Al$^+$ clocks. Systematic uncertainties are lower\\ndue to an improved ion trap electrical design, which reduces excess\\nmicromotion, and a new vacuum system, which reduces collisional shifts. We also\\nperform a direction-sensitive measurement of the ac magnetic field due to the\\nRF ion trap, eliminating systematic uncertainty due to field orientation.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T16:32:15Z\"}"}
