{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04169v1\", \"title\": \"Navigating Chemical Space: Multi-Level Bayesian Optimization with\\n  Hierarchical Coarse-Graining\", \"summary\": \"Molecular discovery within the vast chemical space remains a significant\\nchallenge due to the immense number of possible molecules and limited\\nscalability of conventional screening methods. To approach chemical space\\nexploration more effectively, we have developed an active learning-based method\\nthat uses transferable coarse-grained models to compress chemical space into\\nvarying levels of resolution. By using multiple representations of chemical\\nspace with different coarse-graining resolutions, we balance combinatorial\\ncomplexity and chemical detail. To identify target compounds, we first\\ntransform the discrete molecular spaces into smooth latent representations. We\\nthen perform Bayesian optimization within these latent spaces, using molecular\\ndynamics simulations to calculate target free energies of the coarse-grained\\ncompounds. This multi-level approach effectively balances exploration and\\nexploitation at lower and higher resolutions, respectively. We demonstrate the\\neffectiveness of our method by optimizing molecules to enhance phase separation\\nin phospholipid bilayers. Our funnel-like strategy not only suggests optimal\\ncompounds but also provides insight into relevant neighborhoods in chemical\\nspace. We show how this neighborhood information from lower resolutions can\\nguide the optimization at higher resolutions, thereby providing an efficient\\nway to navigate large chemical spaces for free energy-based molecular\\noptimization.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T06:45:30Z\"}"}
