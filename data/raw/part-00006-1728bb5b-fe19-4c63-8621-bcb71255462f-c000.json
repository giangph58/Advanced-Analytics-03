With the\\ndiminishing returns of Moore's Law, optimizing multiplier performance now\\nnecessitates process-aware architectural innovations rather than relying solely\\non technology scaling. In this paper, we introduce DOMAC, a novel approach that\\nemploys differentiable optimization for designing multipliers and MACs at\\nspecific technology nodes. DOMAC establishes an analogy between optimizing\\nmulti-staged parallel compressor trees and training deep neural networks.\\nBuilding on this insight, DOMAC reformulates the discrete optimization\\nchallenge into a continuous problem by incorporating differentiable timing and\\narea objectives. This formulation enables us to utilize existing deep learning\\ntoolkit for highly efficient implementation of the differentiable solver.\\nExperimental results demonstrate that DOMAC achieves significant enhancements\\nin both performance and area efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines\\nand commercial IPs in multiplier and MAC designs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AR\", \"categories\": \"cs.AR\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T10:49:05Z\"}"}
