It is an important problem to construct an infinite\\nfamily of cyclic codes with large minimum distance $d$ and dual distance\\n$d^{\\\\perp}$. In recent years, much research has been devoted to improving the\\nlower bound on $d$, some of which have exceeded the square-root bound. The\\nconstructions presented recently seem to indicate that when the minimum\\ndistance increases, the minimum distance of its dual code decreases. In this\\npaper, we focus on the new constructions of binary cyclic codes with length\\n$n=2^m-1$, dimension near $n/2$, and both relatively large minimum distance and\\ndual distance. For $m$ is even, we construct a family of binary cyclic codes\\nwith parameters $[2^m-1,2^{m-1}\\\\pm1,d]$, where $d\\\\ge 2^{m/2}-1$ and\\n$d^\\\\perp\\\\ge2^{m/2}$. Both the minimum distance and the dual distance are\\nsignificantly better than the previous results. When $m$ is the product of two\\ndistinct primes, we construct some cyclic codes with dimensions $k=(n+1)/2$ and\\n$d>\\\\frac{n}{\\\\log_2n},$ where the lower bound on the minimum distance is much\\nlarger than the square-root bound. For $m$ is odd, we present two families of\\nbinary $[2^m-1,2^{m-1},d]$ cyclic codes with $d\\\\ge2^{(m+1)/2}-1$,\\n$d^\\\\perp\\\\ge2^{(m+1)/2}$ and $d\\\\ge2^{(m+3)/2}-15$, $d^\\\\perp\\\\ge2^{(m-1)/2}$\\nrespectively, which leads that $d\\\\cdot d^\\\\perp$ can reach $2n$ asymptotically.\\nTo the best of our knowledge, except for the punctured binary Reed-Muller\\ncodes, there is no other construction of binary cyclic codes that reaches this\\nbound.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T09:29:41Z\"}"}
