We establish an integrality result for the $j$-invariants of\\nnon-cuspidal rational points on $X_0(N)^*$, representing a significant step\\ntoward resolving a key subcase of Elkies' conjecture. To this end, we prove the\\nexistence of rank-zero quotients of certain modular Jacobians $J_0(pq)$.\\nFurthermore, we provide a conjecturally complete classification of the rational\\npoints on $X_0(N)^*$ of genus $1 \\\\leq g \\\\leq 5$. In the process we identify\\nexceptional rational points on $X_0(147)^*$ and $X_0(75)^*$ which were not\\nknown before.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT,math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T17:39:18Z\"}"}
