{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17454v1\", \"title\": \"Adaptive Orchestration of Modular Generative Information Access Systems\", \"summary\": \"Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have driven the emergence of\\ncomplex new systems to provide access to information, that we will collectively\\nrefer to as modular generative information access (GenIA) systems. They\\nintegrate a broad and evolving range of specialized components, including LLMs,\\nretrieval models, and a heterogeneous set of sources and tools. While\\nmodularity offers flexibility, it also raises critical challenges: How can we\\nsystematically characterize the space of possible modules and their\\ninteractions? How can we automate and optimize interactions among these\\nheterogeneous components? And, how do we enable this modular system to\\ndynamically adapt to varying user query requirements and evolving module\\ncapabilities? In this perspective paper, we argue that the architecture of\\nfuture modular generative information access systems will not just assemble\\npowerful components, but enable a self-organizing system through real-time\\nadaptive orchestration -- where components' interactions are dynamically\\nconfigured for each user input, maximizing information relevance while\\nminimizing computational overhead. We give provisional answers to the questions\\nraised above with a roadmap that depicts the key principles and methods for\\ndesigning such an adaptive modular system. We identify pressing challenges, and\\npropose avenues for addressing them in the years ahead. This perspective urges\\nthe IR community to rethink modular system designs for developing adaptive,\\nself-optimizing, and future-ready architectures that evolve alongside their\\nrapidly advancing underlying technologies.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T11:35:43Z\"}"}
