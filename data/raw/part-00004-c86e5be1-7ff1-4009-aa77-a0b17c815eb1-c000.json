We develop a general backpropagation framework via the so-called\\nextended adjoint state, suitable for any linear PDE; crucially, this approach\\nreduces by half the number of required PDE solves. Applications to several\\ndifferent PDE models demonstrate the universality of our method. In addition,\\nwe analyze the nonlinearity of the correlated model, revealing a surprising\\ntangential cone condition-like structure, thereby advancing the state of the\\nart towards a convergence guarantee for regularized reconstruction in passive\\nimaging.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:18:34Z\"}"}
