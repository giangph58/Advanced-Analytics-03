It involves an interesting function,\\nwhich we denote as $\\\\mathcal{F}_1(x)$. In this paper, we show that\\n$\\\\mathcal{F}_1(x)$ belongs to the category of period functions as it satisfies\\nthe period relations of Maass forms in the sense of Lewis and Zagier \\\\cite{lz}.\\nHence, we refer to $\\\\mathcal{F}_1(x)$ as the \\\\emph{Ramanujan period function}.\\nMoreover, one of the salient aspects of the Ramanujan period function\\n$\\\\mathcal{F}_1(x)$ that we found out is that it is a Hecke eigenfunction under\\nthe action of Hecke operators on the space of periods. We also establish that\\nit naturally appears in a Kronecker limit formula of a certain zeta function,\\nrevealing its connections to various topics. Finally, we generalize\\n$\\\\mathcal{F}_1(x)$ to include a parameter $s,$ connecting our work to the\\nbroader theory of period functions developed by Bettin and Conrey \\\\cite{bc} and\\nLewis and Zagier \\\\cite{lz}. We emphasize that Ramanujan was the first to study\\nthis function, marking the beginning of the study of period functions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT,math.CA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T06:26:22Z\"}"}
