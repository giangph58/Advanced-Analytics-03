We evaluate 13\\nmodels (LLMs and MT models) using automatic metrics and human assessment by\\nbilingual annotators. Our findings show LLMs outperform traditional MT systems\\nbut struggle with entity translation requiring cultural adaptation. By\\nconstructing an error taxonomy, we identify incorrect responses and entity name\\nerrors as key issues, with performance varying by entity type and popularity\\nlevel. This work exposes gaps in automatic evaluation metrics and hope to\\nenable future work in completing culturally-nuanced machine translation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T05:58:19Z\"}"}
