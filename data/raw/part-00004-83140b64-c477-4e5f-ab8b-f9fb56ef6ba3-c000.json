In this\\nstudy, we have explored the quantum processor application to compute the Helium\\n(He) molecule ground state energy which utilizes the Variational Quantum\\nEigensolver (VQE) algorithm. In here, we have implemented VQE on a\\nstate-of-the-art quantum processor, optimizing a parameterized quantum circuit\\nto minimize the energy expectation value of the He molecule's Hamiltonian on\\nthe four qubits processor. The obtained results of this work show a significant\\nimprovement in accuracy compared to classical computational methods, such as\\nHartree-Fock and density functional theory, which demonstrate the compute\\npotential of quantum algorithms in quantum many-body problems. Thus, these\\nresults demonstrate the advantages of quantum computing in achieving high\\naccuracy in simulations of molecular and material properties, and pave the way\\nfor future applications in more complex systems. This work highlights the\\npotential of quantum processors in the fields of quantum chemistry,\\ncomputational physics, and data science.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T09:00:08Z\"}"}
