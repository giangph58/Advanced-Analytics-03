{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07477v1\", \"title\": \"Enabling Gigantic MIMO Beamforming with Analog Computing\", \"summary\": \"In our previous work, we have introduced a microwave linear analog computer\\n(MiLAC) as an analog computer that processes microwave signals linearly,\\ndemonstrating its potential to reduce the computational complexity of specific\\nsignal processing tasks. In this paper, we extend these benefits to wireless\\ncommunications, showcasing how MiLAC enables gigantic multiple-input\\nmultiple-output (MIMO) beamforming entirely in the analog domain. MiLAC-aided\\nbeamforming can implement regularized zero-forcing beamforming (R-ZFBF) at the\\ntransmitter and minimum mean square error (MMSE) detection at the receiver,\\nwhile significantly reducing hardware costs by minimizing the number of\\nradio-frequency (RF) chains and only relying on low-resolution\\nanalog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital-to-analog converters (DACs). In\\naddition, it eliminates per-symbol operations by completely avoiding\\ndigital-domain processing and remarkably reduces the computational complexity\\nof R-ZFBF, which scales quadratically with the number of antennas instead of\\ncubically. Numerical results show that it can perform R-ZFBF with a\\ncomputational complexity reduction of up to 7400 times compared to digital\\nbeamforming.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,eess.SP,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T06:06:03Z\"}"}
