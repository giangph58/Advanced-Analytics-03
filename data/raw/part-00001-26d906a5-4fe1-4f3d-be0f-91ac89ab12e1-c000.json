{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15875v1\", \"title\": \"Identifying eclipsing binary stars with TESS data based on a new hybrid\\n  deep learning model\", \"summary\": \"Eclipsing binary systems (EBs), as foundational objects in stellar\\nastrophysics, have garnered significant attention in recent years. These\\nsystems exhibit periodic decreases in light intensity when one star obscures\\nthe other from the observer's perspective, producing characteristic light\\ncurves (LCs). With the advent of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite\\n(TESS), a vast repository of stellar LCs has become available, offering\\nunprecedented opportunities for discovering new EBs. To efficiently identify\\nsuch systems, we propose a novel method that combines LC data and generalized\\nLomb-Scargle periodograms (GLS) data to classify EBs. At the core of this\\nmethod is CNN Attention LSTM Net (CALNet), a hybrid deep learning model\\nintegrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\\nnetworks, and an Attention Mechanism based on the Convolutional Block Attention\\nModule (CBAM). We collected 4,225 EB samples, utilizing their 2-minute cadence\\nLCs for model training and validation. CALNet achieved a recall rate of 99.1%,\\ndemonstrating its robustness and effectiveness. Applying it to TESS 2-minute\\nLCs from Sectors 1 to 74, we identified 9,351 new EBs after manual visual\\ninspection, significantly expanding the known sample size. This work highlights\\nthe potential of advanced deep-learning techniques in large-scale astronomical\\nsurveys and provides a valuable resource for further studies on EBs.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T13:22:33Z\"}"}
