The\\nsensitivity of non-Hermitian quantum sensors is determined by the effective\\nquantum Fisher information (QFI), which incorporates the success probability of\\npost-selection. We demonstrate that non-Hermitian sensors cannot outperform\\ntheir Hermitian counterpart when all information is harnessed, since the total\\nQFI for the extended system constrains the effective QFI of the non-Hermitian\\nsubsystem. Moreover, we quantify the efficiency of non-Hermitian sensors with\\nthe ratio of the effective QFI to the total QFI, which can be optimized within\\nthe framework of post-selected measurements with minimal experimental trials.\\nOur work provides a distinctive theoretical framework for investigating\\nnon-Hermitian quantum sensing and designing noise-resilient quantum\\nmetrological protocols.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T08:48:18Z\"}"}
