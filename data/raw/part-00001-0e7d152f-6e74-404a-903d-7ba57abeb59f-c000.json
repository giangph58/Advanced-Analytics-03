In\\ninflationary models with nonminimal coupling, such attractors typically arise\\nin the strong coupling limit. To align with observational constraints, we focus\\non nonminimal coupling models with small coupling constants. For the model with\\nthe coupling function $\\\\Omega(\\\\phi) = 1 + \\\\xi f(\\\\phi)$ and the potential\\n$V(\\\\phi) = \\\\lambda^2 f^2(\\\\phi)$, we find that observational data constrain the\\nparameters as $0.1 \\\\lesssim \\\\xi \\\\lesssim 35$ and $0 \\\\lesssim k \\\\lesssim 1.5$\\nfor $f(\\\\phi) = \\\\phi^k$ at the $1\\\\sigma$ confidence level. With the help of the\\nnonmiminal coupling $\\\\Omega(\\\\phi) = 1 + \\\\xi \\\\phi^2$, the hilltop inflation and\\npower-law inflation models with power indices $2/3$ and $1/3$ can be consistent\\nwith observational data within the $1\\\\sigma$ range. We also give the viable\\nparameter regions for $\\\\xi$ for these three models.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T16:43:18Z\"}"}
