We show that\\nour metric is a specific variant of the transport distance recently constructed\\nin [DSHS24]. As a consequence, we show that the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup is\\nthe gradient flow of the specific relative entropy w.r.t. the newly constructed\\ndistance. Furthermore, we show the existence of stationary geodesics, establish\\n$1$-geodesic convexity of the specific relative entropy, and derive stationary\\nanalogues of functional inequalities such as a specific HWI inequality and a\\nspecific Talagrand inequality. One of the key technical contributions is the\\nexistence of solutions to the non-local continuity equation between arbitrary\\npoint processes.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T13:03:48Z\"}"}
