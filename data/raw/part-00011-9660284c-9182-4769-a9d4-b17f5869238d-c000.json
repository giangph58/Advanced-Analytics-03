We present ColBERT-serve, a novel serving\\nsystem that applies a memory-mapping strategy to the ColBERT index, reducing\\nRAM usage by 90% and permitting its deployment on cheap servers, and\\nincorporates a multi-stage architecture with hybrid scoring, reducing ColBERT's\\nquery latency and supporting many concurrent queries in parallel.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T07:18:09Z\"}"}
