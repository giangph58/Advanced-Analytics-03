Correspondences between these\\nnorms and a class of convex functions are established. Explicit formulas for\\nthe dual norm and the convex subdifferential of a given primal norm are\\nderived. It is demonstrated that this class of norms is well-suited for\\nstudying properties and problems on product spaces. As an application, we study\\nthe von Neumann-Jordan constant of norms on product spaces and extend a\\nclassical result of Clarkson from Lebesgue spaces to general normed vector\\nspaces.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T10:00:04Z\"}"}
