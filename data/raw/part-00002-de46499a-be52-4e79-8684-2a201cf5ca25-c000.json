In each vertex, the\\nwalk will either terminate with some probability $\\\\alpha$, or continue to a\\nrandom out-neighbor. We are interested in the probability $\\\\pi(s,t)$ that such\\na random walk starting in $s$ ends in $t$. We wish to, with constant\\nprobability, estimate $\\\\pi(s, t)$ within a constant relative error, unless\\n$\\\\pi(s, t) < \\\\delta$ for some given threshold $\\\\delta$.\\n  The current status is as follows. Algorithms with worst-case running time\\n$\\\\tilde O(m)$ and $O(1/\\\\delta)$ are known. A more complicated algorithm is\\nknown, which does not perform better in the worst case, but for the average\\nrunning time over all $n$ possible targets $t$, it achieves an alternative\\nbound of $O(\\\\sqrt{d/\\\\delta})$. All the above algorithms assume query access to\\nthe adjacency list of a node.\\n  On the lower bound side, the best-known lower bound for the worst case is\\n$\\\\Omega(n^{1/2}m^{1/4})$ with $\\\\delta \\\\leq 1/(n^{1/2}m^{1/4})$, and for the\\naverage case it is $\\\\Omega(\\\\sqrt{n})$ with $\\\\delta \\\\leq 1/n$. This leaves\\nsubstantial polynomial gaps in both cases.\\n  In this paper, we show that the above upper bounds are tight across all\\nparameters $n$, $m$ and $\\\\delta$. We show that the right bound is\\n$\\\\tilde\\\\Theta(\\\\min\\\\{m, 1/\\\\delta\\\\})$ for the worst case, and\\n$\\\\tilde\\\\Theta(\\\\min\\\\{m, \\\\sqrt{d/\\\\delta}, 1/\\\\delta\\\\})$ for the average case.\\n  We also consider some additional graph queries from the literature. One\\nallows checking whether there is an edge from $u$ to $v$ in constant time.\\nAnother allows access to the adjacency list of $u$ sorted by out-degree. We\\nprove that none of these access queries help in the worst case, but if we have\\nboth of them, we get an average-case bound of $\\\\tilde\\n\\\\Theta(\\\\min\\\\{m,\\\\sqrt{d/\\\\delta}, (1/\\\\delta)^{2/3}\\\\})$.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T07:47:07Z\"}"}
