{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11792v1\", \"title\": \"Large Language Models for Drug Overdose Prediction from Longitudinal\\n  Medical Records\", \"summary\": \"The ability to predict drug overdose risk from a patient's medical records is\\ncrucial for timely intervention and prevention. Traditional machine learning\\nmodels have shown promise in analyzing longitudinal medical records for this\\ntask. However, recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer an\\nopportunity to enhance prediction performance by leveraging their ability to\\nprocess long textual data and their inherent prior knowledge across diverse\\ntasks. In this study, we assess the effectiveness of Open AI's GPT-4o LLM in\\npredicting drug overdose events using patients' longitudinal insurance claims\\nrecords. We evaluate its performance in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings,\\ncomparing them to strong traditional machine learning methods as baselines. Our\\nresults show that LLMs not only outperform traditional models in certain\\nsettings but can also predict overdose risk in a zero-shot setting without\\ntask-specific training. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs in\\nclinical decision support, particularly for drug overdose risk prediction.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T05:52:22Z\"}"}
