A semiclassical approach to the theory of gravity is applied in\\nconnection with the Starobinsky inflation model. Some subtleties associated\\nwith taking into account quantum effects in the one-loop approximation are\\nclarified. An estimate of the contribution of vacuum polarization in the\\nenergy-momentum tensor of matter fields to the scalaron decay width is\\npresented.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T11:48:09Z\"}"}
