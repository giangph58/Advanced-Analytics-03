This new proof is\\nbased on Angluin's $L^*$ algorithm, that learns an automaton from a minimally\\nadequate teacher. This relates in particular two results from the 1980s:\\nAngluin's $L^*$ algorithm, and a result from Valk and Jantzen on the\\ncomputability of bases for upwards-closed sets of tuples of integers. Along the\\nway, we describe an algorithm for learning quasi-ordered automata from a\\nminimally adequate teacher, and extend a generalization of Valk and Jantzen's\\nresult, encompassing both words and integers, to finitely generated monoids.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.FL\", \"categories\": \"cs.FL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T08:37:41Z\"}"}
