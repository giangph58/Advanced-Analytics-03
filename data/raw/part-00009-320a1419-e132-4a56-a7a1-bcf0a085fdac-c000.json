{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00593v1\", \"title\": \"A Novel Feature-Aware Chaotic Image Encryption Scheme For Data Security\\n  and Privacy in IoT and Edge Networks\", \"summary\": \"The security of image data in the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge networks\\nis crucial due to the increasing deployment of intelligent systems for\\nreal-time decision-making. Traditional encryption algorithms such as AES and\\nRSA are computationally expensive for resource-constrained IoT devices and\\nineffective for large-volume image data, leading to inefficiencies in\\nprivacy-preserving distributed learning applications. To address these\\nconcerns, this paper proposes a novel Feature-Aware Chaotic Image Encryption\\nscheme that integrates Feature-Aware Pixel Segmentation (FAPS) with Chaotic\\nChain Permutation and Confusion mechanisms to enhance security while\\nmaintaining efficiency. The proposed scheme consists of three stages: (1) FAPS,\\nwhich extracts and reorganizes pixels based on high and low edge intensity\\nfeatures for correlation disruption; (2) Chaotic Chain Permutation, which\\nemploys a logistic chaotic map with SHA-256-based dynamically updated keys for\\nblock-wise permutation; and (3) Chaotic chain Confusion, which utilises\\ndynamically generated chaotic seed matrices for bitwise XOR operations.\\nExtensive security and performance evaluations demonstrate that the proposed\\nscheme significantly reduces pixel correlation -- almost zero, achieves high\\nentropy values close to 8, and resists differential cryptographic attacks. The\\noptimum design of the proposed scheme makes it suitable for real-time\\ndeployment in resource-constrained environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T15:26:48Z\"}"}
