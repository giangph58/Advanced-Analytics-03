A major issue in this process is the redundant verification\\nof already fact-checked claims, which increases workload and delays responses\\nto newly emerging claims. This research introduces an approach that retrieves\\npreviously fact-checked claims, evaluates their relevance to a given input, and\\nprovides supplementary information to support fact-checkers. Our method employs\\nlarge language models (LLMs) to filter irrelevant fact-checks and generate\\nconcise summaries and explanations, enabling fact-checkers to faster assess\\nwhether a claim has been verified before. In addition, we evaluate our approach\\nthrough both automatic and human assessments, where humans interact with the\\ndeveloped tool to review its effectiveness. Our results demonstrate that LLMs\\nare able to filter out many irrelevant fact-checks and, therefore, reduce\\neffort and streamline the fact-checking process.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T11:49:05Z\"}"}
