For that purpose, several models have been\\ndeveloped at the district scale. At this scale, the outside surface energy\\nbudget is detailed, however building models are very simplified and considered\\nas a boundary condition of the district scale model. This shortcoming inhibits\\nthe opportunity to investigate the effect of urban microclimate on the inside\\nbuilding conditions. The aim of this work is to improve the representation of\\nthe physical phenomena involved in the building models of a district model. For\\nthat purpose, the model integrates inside and outside fully detailed long-wave\\nradiative flux. The numerical model is based on finite differences to solve\\nconduction through all the surfaces and the radiosity method to solve long-wave\\nradiative heat fluxes inside and outside. Calculated temperatures and heat\\nfluxes are evaluated with respect to \\\\textit{in situ} measurements from an\\nexperimental demonstrator over 14 sensors and a 24-day period. Results are also\\ncompared to state-of-the-art models simulation tool show improvement of the\\nRMSE of $0.9 \\\\ \\\\mathsf{^{\\\\,\\\\circ}C}$ to $2.1 \\\\ \\\\mathsf{^{\\\\,\\\\circ}C}$ on the\\nsurface temperature modeled.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CE\", \"categories\": \"cs.CE,I.6\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T13:45:16Z\"}"}
