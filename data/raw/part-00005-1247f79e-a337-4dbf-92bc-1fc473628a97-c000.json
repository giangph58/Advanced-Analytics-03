{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19782v1\", \"title\": \"Cooling process of the high-mass young stellar object G24.33+0.14\\n  following an accretion burst\", \"summary\": \"The HMYSO G24.33+0.14 (G24), has recently been observed to undergo an\\naccretion burst since September 2019, lasting approximately two years. By\\nutilizing 1.3 mm observational data from the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array\\n(NOEMA) in March 2020 and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array\\n(ALMA) in September 2019, we have examined the physical environment changes in\\ngas and dust within G24 region during the decay phase of the accretion burst.\\nFollowing the burst, the continuum emission in the inner core region of G24\\ndiminished by approximately 20%, while the emission in the outer region\\nexhibited an increase by a factor of ~30%. This pattern indicates that the heat\\nwave, triggered by the accretion burst, radiated outward from the core's\\ninterior to its periphery over the half-year period, with a calculated\\npropagation speed of 0.08-0.38 times the speed of light. Moreover, the methanol\\nemission intensity in this area has experienced a notable decline, with the\\nrate of flux reduction correlating positively with the energy of the upper\\nenergy states. This, in conjunction with the analysis of methanol molecular\\nline rotation temperature diagrams for different emitting regions, further\\nsubstantiates that the core region of G24 cooled down, contrasted with the\\npersistent heating in the outer region following the burst.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T13:27:29Z\"}"}
