Geom. (2021)] and\\nKobayashi--Ohno [Osaka Math. J.

In this paper, we\\ninvestigate the Amari--Chentsov $\\\\alpha$-connections on the submanifold\\n$\\\\mathcal{N}_0$ consisting of zero-mean $n$-variate normal distributions. It is\\nknown that $\\\\mathcal{N}_0$ admits a natural transitive action of the general\\nlinear group $GL(n,\\\\mathbb{R})$. We establish a one-to-one correspondence\\nbetween the set of $GL(n,\\\\mathbb{R})$-invariant conjugate symmetric statistical\\nconnections on $\\\\mathcal{N}_0$ with respect to the Fisher metric and the space\\nof homogeneous cubic real symmetric polynomials in $n$ variables. As a\\nconsequence, if $n \\\\geq 2$, we show that the Amari--Chentsov\\n$\\\\alpha$-connections on $\\\\mathcal{N}_0$ are not uniquely characterized by the\\ninvariance under the $GL(n,\\\\mathbb{R})$-action among all conjugate symmetric\\nstatistical connections with respect to the Fisher metric. Furthermore, we show\\nthat any invariant statistical structure on a Riemannian symmetric space is\\nnecessarily conjugate symmetric.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T04:50:35Z\"}"}
