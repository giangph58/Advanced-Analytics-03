{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11293v1\", \"title\": \"Remote electric-field control of antiferromagnetic magnon-polaritons\", \"summary\": \"The control of hybrid light-matter states, specifically magnon-polaritons\\nthat emerge from the strong coupling between magnons and cavity photons,\\nremains a key challenge in developing reconfigurable quantum and classical\\ndevices. Here, we showcase the ability to remotely control antiferromagnetic\\nmagnon-polaritons at room temperature using electric field by integrating a\\nhighly birefringent liquid crystal layer into a terahertz Fabry-P\\\\'erot cavity\\ncontaining an antiferromagnetic crystal. Positioned several millimeters from\\nthe magnetic material, the liquid crystal allows for adjusting the cavity's\\nphotonic environment through electric field. This adjustment, in turn,\\ninfluences the coupling strength of a particular cavity mode to the magnon\\nresonance, thereby controlling the extent of magnon dressing by cavity photons.\\nOur approach facilitates dynamic and reversible tuning of magnon-photon\\nhybridization without the need for direct electrical contact or alterations to\\nthe magnetic medium. These findings create the conditions for\\nvoltage-programmable terahertz magnonic devices and new possibilities for\\nnoninvasive control strategies in spin-based information processing\\ntechnologies.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.other\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.other\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:32:31Z\"}"}
