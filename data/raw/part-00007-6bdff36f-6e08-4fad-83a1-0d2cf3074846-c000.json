Using De\\nCommer's notion of a braided action, we then define group reflections for a\\nbraided group, and prove that they provide group Drinfeld twists in the sense\\nof Ghobadi. Finally, we characterise when a reflection on a solution (X,r) can\\nbe extended to a group reflection on the structure group G(X,r).\", \"main_category\": \"math.QA\", \"categories\": \"math.QA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:17:47Z\"}"}
