We revisit the analysis made in Ref. \\\\cite{unruh}, extending it to\\nphantom scalar fields. It is argued that only in this case a non-trivial\\nevolution for the scalar field can be obtained. The behavior of the scale\\nfactor presents a bounce followed by a de Sitter expansion, reproducing the\\nquantum cosmological scenario in General Relativity when the source is given by\\na cosmological term described by the Schutz variable. The analysis is extended\\nto the Brans-Dicke scalar tensor theory.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T10:31:35Z\"}"}
