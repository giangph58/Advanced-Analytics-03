{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10408v1\", \"title\": \"Software package for simulations using the coarse-grained CALVADOS model\", \"summary\": \"We present the CALVADOS package for performing simulations of biomolecules\\nusing OpenMM and the coarse-grained CALVADOS model. The package makes it easy\\nto run simulations using the family of CALVADOS models of biomolecules\\nincluding disordered proteins, multi-domain proteins, proteins in crowded\\nenvironments, and disordered RNA. We briefly describe the CALVADOS force fields\\nand how they were parametrised. We then discuss the design paradigms and\\narchitecture of the CALVADOS package, and give examples of how to use it for\\nrunning and analysing simulations. The simulation package is freely available\\nunder a GNU GPL license; therefore, it can easily be extended and we provide\\nsome examples of how this might be done.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.BM\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.BM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:55:20Z\"}"}
