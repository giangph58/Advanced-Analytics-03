{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21549v1\", \"title\": \"Online Experimental Design for Network Tomography\", \"summary\": \"How to efficiently perform network tomography is a fundamental problem in\\nnetwork management and monitoring. A network tomography task usually consists\\nof applying multiple probing experiments, e.g., across different paths or via\\ndifferent casts (including unicast and multicast). We study how to optimize the\\nnetwork tomography process through online sequential decision-making. From the\\nmethodology perspective, we introduce an online probe allocation algorithm that\\ndynamically performs network tomography based on the principles of optimal\\nexperimental design and the maximum likelihood estimation. We rigorously\\nanalyze the regret of the algorithm under the conditions that i) the optimal\\nallocation is Lipschitz continuous in the parameters being estimated and ii)\\nthe parameter estimators satisfy a concentration property. From the application\\nperspective, we present two case studies: a) the classical lossy\\npacket-switched network and b) the quantum bit-flip network. We show that both\\ncases fulfill the two theoretical conditions and provide their corresponding\\nregrets when deploying our proposed online probe allocation algorithm. Besides\\nthese two case studies with theoretical guarantees, we also conduct simulations\\nto compare our proposed algorithm with existing methods and demonstrate our\\nalgorithm's effectiveness in a broader range of scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T11:48:49Z\"}"}
