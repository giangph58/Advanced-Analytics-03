Using\\n1.25 years of post-event Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data, we construct a\\n1 GeV - 1 TeV test-statistic (TS) map within 15 Mpc of the burst. We identify\\ntwo peaks in the TS map with TS $\\\\geq 9$. The most significant peak,\\nJ1911.8+2044, exhibits gamma-ray emission in pre-burst LAT data. The other\\npeak, J1913.2+1901, coincides with a 664.6 GeV photon recorded $\\\\sim191.9$ days\\nafter the GRB trigger and located at about $0.75^{\\\\circ}$ from the GRB\\nlocalization. The per-photon 95% containment angle for the LAT is about\\n$0.25^{\\\\circ}$ in the 100 GeV - 1 TeV energy range. We explore two possible\\norigins for the $\\\\gamma$-ray emission: (1) UHECRs from GRB 221009A propagating\\nthrough a magnetized cosmological volume in its vicinity, and (2) UHE or\\nvery-high-energy (VHE; $\\\\gtrsim 100$ GeV) $\\\\gamma$-ray emission from GRB\\n221009A, propagating in the same volume. In both cases, electromagnetic cascade\\nemission is induced in the structured region embedding the burst. If any TS\\nfeatures are related to large-scale imprints induced by cosmic rays, it might\\nbe further evidence that GRB 221009A accelerated UHECRs. However, our results\\nshow that alternative scenarios without invoking UHECRs cannot be ruled out,\\nand the observed high-energy photon could be unrelated to GRB 221009A.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T13:34:35Z\"}"}
