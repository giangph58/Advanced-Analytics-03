While existing\\nPTMIOD methods demonstrate strong performance on in-domain tasks aligned with\\npretraining data, their plasticity to cross-domain scenarios remains\\nunderexplored. Through systematic component-wise analysis of pretrained\\ndetectors, we reveal a fundamental discrepancy: the localization modules\\ndemonstrate inherent cross-domain stability-preserving precise bounding box\\nestimation across distribution shifts-while the classification components\\nrequire enhanced plasticity to mitigate discriminability degradation in\\ncross-domain scenarios. Motivated by these findings, we propose a dual-path\\nframework built upon pretrained DETR-based detectors which decouples\\nlocalization stability and classification plasticity: the localization path\\nmaintains stability to preserve pretrained localization knowledge, while the\\nclassification path facilitates plasticity via parameter-efficient fine-tuning\\nand resists forgetting with pseudo-feature replay. Extensive evaluations on\\nboth in-domain (MS COCO and PASCAL VOC) and cross-domain (TT100K) benchmarks\\nshow state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating our method's ability to\\neffectively balance stability and plasticity in PTMIOD, achieving robust\\ncross-domain adaptation and strong retention of anti-forgetting capabilities.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T13:31:35Z\"}"}
