In active systems, they are known to\\nhave properties impossible at equilibrium: for example, $+1/2$ defects in\\nnematically-ordered systems self-propel. While some previous theoretical\\ndescriptions relied on assuming that the defect shape remains unperturbed by\\nactivity, we show that this assumption can lead to inconsistent predictions. We\\ncompute the shape of $-1/2$ defects and show that the one of $+1/2$ is\\nintimately related to their self-propulsion speed. Our analytical predictions\\nare corroborated via numerical simulations of a generic active nematic theory.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T10:34:25Z\"}"}
