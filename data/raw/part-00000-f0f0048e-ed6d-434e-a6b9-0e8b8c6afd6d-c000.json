{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13015v1\", \"title\": \"Hierarchical Feature Learning for Medical Point Clouds via State Space\\n  Model\", \"summary\": \"Deep learning-based point cloud modeling has been widely investigated as an\\nindispensable component of general shape analysis. Recently, transformer and\\nstate space model (SSM) have shown promising capacities in point cloud\\nlearning. However, limited research has been conducted on medical point clouds,\\nwhich have great potential in disease diagnosis and treatment. This paper\\npresents an SSM-based hierarchical feature learning framework for medical point\\ncloud understanding. Specifically, we down-sample input into multiple levels\\nthrough the farthest point sampling. At each level, we perform a series of\\nk-nearest neighbor (KNN) queries to aggregate multi-scale structural\\ninformation. To assist SSM in processing point clouds, we introduce\\ncoordinate-order and inside-out scanning strategies for efficient serialization\\nof irregular points. Point features are calculated progressively from short\\nneighbor sequences and long point sequences through vanilla and group Point SSM\\nblocks, to capture both local patterns and long-range dependencies. To evaluate\\nthe proposed method, we build a large-scale medical point cloud dataset named\\nMedPointS for anatomy classification, completion, and segmentation. Extensive\\nexperiments conducted on MedPointS demonstrate that our method achieves\\nsuperior performance across all tasks. The dataset is available at\\nhttps://flemme-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/medpoints.html.
