The key ingredients in the\\nproof are a high rank generalization of the asymptotic Riemann-Roch theorem and\\nLanger's estimation theorem of the global sections of torsion free sheaves.\\nThese results give some Bogomolov type inequalities for semistable sheaves with\\nvanishing low Chern characters. Our results are also applied to obtain\\ninequalities of Chern characters of threefolds and varieties of small\\ncodimension in projective spaces and abelian varieties.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:46:00Z\"}"}
