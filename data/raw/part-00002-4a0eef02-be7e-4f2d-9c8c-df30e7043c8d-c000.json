To reveal the processes\\ndriving the CDW transition, we combine ab-initio calculations analysis of the\\nphonon self-energy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Our\\nmomentum-resolved study, supported by ARPES data, reveals that lattice\\ninstabilities in the V-135 family of kagome metals appear to also be driven by\\nelectronic states far from high-symmetry points, where these states exhibit the\\nstrongest coupling with the phonon modes responsible for the CDW distortion.\\nFooting on an interpretation scheme based on phonon fluctuation diagnostics,\\nour work challenges and revises theories that so far have exclusively\\nattributed CDW formation to nesting effects close to the Fermi level.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:55:41Z\"}"}
