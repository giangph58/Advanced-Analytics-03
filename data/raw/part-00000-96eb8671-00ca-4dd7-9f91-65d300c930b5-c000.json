Relevant\\nresearch areas where such limitations arise include interactive tools and\\ndatabases for exploratory analysis of biomedical data. To address this problem,\\nwe present the Python package NApy, which relies on a Numba and C++ backend\\nwith OpenMP parallelization to enable scalable statistical testing for\\nmixed-type datasets in the presence of missing values. Both with respect to\\nruntime and memory consumption, NApy outperforms competitor tools and baseline\\nimplementations with naive Python-based parallelization by orders of magnitude,\\nthereby enabling on-the-fly analyses in interactive applications. NApy is\\npublicly available at https://github.com/DyHealthNet/NApy.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MS\", \"categories\": \"cs.MS,cs.DC,cs.PF\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T10:45:37Z\"}"}
