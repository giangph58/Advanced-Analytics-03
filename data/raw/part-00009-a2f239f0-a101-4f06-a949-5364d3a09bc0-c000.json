Signalized\\nintersections are paramount for optimizing transportation efficiency and\\nenhancing energy economy, as they inherently induce stop and go traffic\\ndynamics. In this paper, we present an integrated framework that concurrently\\noptimizes signal timing and CAV trajectories at signalized intersections, with\\nthe dual objectives of maximizing traffic throughput and minimizing energy\\nconsumption for CAVs. We first formulate an optimal control strategy for CAVs\\nthat prioritizes trajectory planning to circumvent state constraints, while\\nincorporating the impact of signal timing and HDV behavior. Furthermore, we\\nintroduce a traffic signal control methodology that dynamically adjusts signal\\nphases based on vehicular density per lane, while mitigating disruption for\\nCAVs scheduled to traverse the intersection. Acknowledging the system's\\ninherent dynamism, we also explore event triggered replanning mechanisms that\\nenable CAVs to iteratively refine their planned trajectories in response to the\\nemergence of more efficient routing options. The efficacy of our proposed\\nframework is evaluated through comprehensive simulations in MATLAB.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:08:33Z\"}"}
