The base size of $G$ is the size of a smallest\\nbase for $G$. Extending the results of a recent paper of the author, we prove a\\n2013 conjecture of Fritzsche, K\\\\\\\"ulshammer, and Reiche. Moreover, we generalise\\nthis conjecture and derive an alternative character theoretic formula for the\\nbase size of a certain class of permutation groups. As a consequence of our\\nwork, a third formula for the base size of the symmetric group of degree $n$\\nacting on the subsets of $\\\\{1,2,\\\\dots, n\\\\}$ is obtained.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GR\", \"categories\": \"math.GR,math.RT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:09:00Z\"}"}
