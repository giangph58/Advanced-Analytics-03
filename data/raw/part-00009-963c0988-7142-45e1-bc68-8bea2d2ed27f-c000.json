Conventional deterministic methods often fall short when it\\ncomes to capturing the inherent uncertainty of anomaly detection tasks. This\\npaper introduces a Bayesian Variational Autoencoder (VAE) equipped with\\nmulti-head attention mechanisms for detecting anomalies in brain magnetic\\nresonance imaging (MRI). For the purpose of improving anomaly detection\\nperformance, we incorporate both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimation\\nthrough Bayesian inference. The model was tested on the BraTS2020 dataset, and\\nthe findings were a 0.83 ROC AUC and a 0.83 PR AUC. The data in our paper\\nsuggests that modeling uncertainty is an essential component of anomaly\\ndetection, enhancing both performance and interpretability and providing\\nconfidence estimates, as well as anomaly predictions, for clinicians to\\nleverage in making medical decisions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T03:30:42Z\"}"}
