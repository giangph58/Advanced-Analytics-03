{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20915v1\", \"title\": \"Statistical and Predictive Analysis to Identify Risk Factors and Effects\\n  of Post COVID-19 Syndrome\", \"summary\": \"Based on recent studies, some COVID-19 symptoms can persist for months after\\ninfection, leading to what is termed long COVID. Factors such as vaccination\\ntiming, patient characteristics, and symptoms during the acute phase of\\ninfection may contribute to the prolonged effects and intensity of long COVID.\\nEach patient, based on their unique combination of factors, develops a specific\\nrisk or intensity of long COVID. In this work, we aim to achieve two\\nobjectives: (1) conduct a statistical analysis to identify relationships\\nbetween various factors and long COVID, and (2) perform predictive analysis of\\nlong COVID intensity using these factors. We benchmark and interpret various\\ndata-driven approaches, including linear models, random forests, gradient\\nboosting, and neural networks, using data from the Lifelines COVID-19 cohort.\\nOur results show that Neural Networks (NN) achieve the best performance in\\nterms of MAPE, with predictions averaging 19\\\\% error. Additionally,\\ninterpretability analysis reveals key factors such as loss of smell, headache,\\nmuscle pain, and vaccination timing as significant predictors, while chronic\\ndisease and gender are critical risk factors. These insights provide valuable\\nguidance for understanding long COVID and developing targeted interventions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T16:34:06Z\"}"}
