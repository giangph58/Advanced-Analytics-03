First, we algorithmically identify the\\naccumulation phase, marking the initial and final insider volume spikes, and\\nobserve that 70% of pre-event volume transacts within one hour of the pump\\nannouncement. Second, we compute conservative lower bounds on insider profits\\nunder both a single-point liquidation at 70% of peak and a tranche-based\\nstrategy (selling 20% at 50%, 30% at 60%, and 50% at 80% of peak), yielding\\nmedian returns above 100% and upper-quartile returns exceeding 2000%. Third, by\\nunfolding the full pump structure and integrating social-media verification\\n(e.g., Telegram announcements), we confirm numerous additional events that\\neluded our initial model. We also categorize schemes into \\\"pre-accumulation\\\"\\nversus \\\"on-the-spot\\\" archetypes-insights that sharpen detection algorithms,\\ninform risk assessments, and underpin actionable strategies for real-time\\nmarket-integrity enforcement.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.TR\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.TR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T11:05:31Z\"}"}
