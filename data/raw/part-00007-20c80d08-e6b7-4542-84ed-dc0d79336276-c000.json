{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00368v1\", \"title\": \"Urban Air Mobility as a System of Systems: An LLM-Enhanced Holonic\\n  Approach\", \"summary\": \"Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is an emerging System of System (SoS) that faces\\nchallenges in system architecture, planning, task management, and execution.\\nTraditional architectural approaches struggle with scalability, adaptability,\\nand seamless resource integration within dynamic and complex environments. This\\npaper presents an intelligent holonic architecture that incorporates Large\\nLanguage Model (LLM) to manage the complexities of UAM. Holons function semi\\nautonomously, allowing for real time coordination among air taxis, ground\\ntransport, and vertiports. LLMs process natural language inputs, generate\\nadaptive plans, and manage disruptions such as weather changes or airspace\\nclosures.Through a case study of multimodal transportation with electric\\nscooters and air taxis, we demonstrate how this architecture enables dynamic\\nresource allocation, real time replanning, and autonomous adaptation without\\ncentralized control, creating more resilient and efficient urban transportation\\nnetworks. By advancing decentralized control and AI driven adaptability, this\\nwork lays the groundwork for resilient, human centric UAM ecosystems, with\\nfuture efforts targeting hybrid AI integration and real world validation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.ET,cs.MA,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T07:39:11Z\"}"}
