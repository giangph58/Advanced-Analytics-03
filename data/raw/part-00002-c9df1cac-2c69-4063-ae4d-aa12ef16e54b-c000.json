{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02754v1\", \"title\": \"Learning dynamics on the picosecond timescale in a superconducting\\n  synapse structure\", \"summary\": \"Conventional Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are running into\\nlimitations in terms of training time and energy. Following the principles of\\nthe human brain, spiking neural networks trained with unsupervised learning\\noffer a faster, more energy-efficient alternative. However, the dynamics of\\nspiking, learning, and forgetting become more complicated in such schemes. Here\\nwe study a superconducting electronics implementation of a learning synapse and\\nexperimentally measure its spiking dynamics. By pulsing the system with a\\nsuperconducting neuron, we show that a superconducting inductor can dynamically\\nhold the synaptic weight with updates due to learning and forgetting. Learning\\ncan be stopped by slowing down the arrival time of the post-synaptic pulse, in\\naccordance with the Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity paradigm. We find\\nexcellent agreement with circuit simulations, and by fitting the turn-on of the\\npulsing frequency, we confirm a learning time of 16.1 +/- 1 ps. The power\\ndissipation in the learning part of the synapse is less than one attojoule per\\nlearning event. This leads to the possibility of an extremely fast and\\nenergy-efficient learning processor.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.dis-nn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T16:46:19Z\"}"}
