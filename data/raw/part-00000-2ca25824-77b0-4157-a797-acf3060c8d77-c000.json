Several preceding models\\nconceptualized the self-aggregation of convection as a phase transition driven\\nby collisions between cold pool gust fronts. However, self-aggregation may also\\nbe influenced by various physical processes, such as surface fluxes, radiation,\\nand moisture perturbations in the planetary boundary layer, and it remains\\nunclear which process plays a dominant role. In this study, we develop a simple\\nstochastic lattice model for the pattern formation of deep convection, inspired\\nby the two-dimensional Ising model. Here, in addition to the process of cold\\npool collisions, which have an effect of triggering new convection, we\\nincorporate the process of clear-sky radiative cooling that has an effect of\\nsuppressing deep convection as an interaction between clouds. Our results show\\nthat by amplifying the intensity of the clear-sky radiative cooling effect, the\\ntransition from a quasi-uniform to an inhomogeneous cloud field can be\\nreproduced. The model also successfully explains the dependence of\\nself-aggregation on several model parameters, such as the experimental domain\\nsize and the characteristic size of cold pools. Furthermore, by varying the\\ndistance over which the subsidence induced by radiative cooling extends, we\\nsucceed in capturing a pattern formation that closely resembles the convective\\nclusters observed in the real atmosphere and three-dimensional numerical model\\nsimulations.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T10:38:33Z\"}"}
