We demonstrate that in all three cases\\n(static neutral BTZ, charged BTZ, and rotating BTZ black holes), both the\\ninnermost small black hole states and the outermost large black hole states\\nexhibit stable thermodynamic behavior. In the low-temperature limit, all three\\ncases exhibit a thermodynamically stable small black hole state. Conversely, in\\nthe high-temperature limit, each system admits a thermodynamically stable large\\nblack hole state. Through this analysis, we have rigorously shown that static\\nneutral, charged, and rotating BTZ black holes are consistently classified\\nwithin the $W^{1+}$ category. Our results demonstrate that neither the charge\\nparameter nor the rotation parameter exerts significant influence on the\\nuniversal thermodynamic topological classification of three-dimensional static\\nneutral BTZ black holes. This reveals a fundamental dichotomy: while angular\\nmomentum and electric charge dominate the thermodynamic topology of\\nfour-dimensional static black holes, their effects become negligible in the\\nthree-dimensional static BTZ case, highlighting a dimension-driven divergence\\nin black hole thermodynamic behavior.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T04:39:37Z\"}"}
