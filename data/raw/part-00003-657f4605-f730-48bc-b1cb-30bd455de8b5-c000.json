To support the large-scale deployment of RISs, a\\nreliable and efficient diagnostic method is essential to ensure optimal\\nperformance. In this work, a robust and efficient approach for RIS diagnostics\\nis proposed using a space-time coding strategy with orthogonal codes. The\\nmethod encodes the reflected signals from individual RIS elements into distinct\\ncode channels, enabling the recovery of channel power at the receiving\\nterminals for fault identification. Theoretical analysis shows that the\\nnormally functioning elements generate high power in their respective code\\nchannels, whereas the faulty elements exhibit significantly lower power. This\\ndistinction enables rapid and accurate diagnostics of elements' operational\\nstates through simple signal processing techniques. Simulation results validate\\nthe effectiveness of the proposed method, even under high fault ratios and\\nvarying reception angles. Proof-of-principle experiments on two RIS prototypes\\nare conducted, implementing two coding strategies: direct and segmented.\\nExperimental results in a realistic scenario confirm the reliability of the\\ndiagnostic method, demonstrating its potential for large-scale RIS deployment\\nin future wireless communication systems and radar applications.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,cs.IT,eess.SP,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T07:58:26Z\"}"}
