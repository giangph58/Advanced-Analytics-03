{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09924v1\", \"title\": \"Passive Channel Charting: Locating Passive Targets using Wi-Fi Channel\\n  State Information\", \"summary\": \"We propose passive channel charting, an extension of channel charting to\\npassive target localization. As in conventional channel charting, we follow a\\ndimensionality reduction approach to reconstruct a physically interpretable map\\nof target positions from similarities in high-dimensional channel state\\ninformation. We show that algorithms and neural network architectures developed\\nin the context of channel charting with active mobile transmitters can be\\nstraightforwardly applied to the passive case, where we assume a scenario with\\nstatic transmitters and receivers and a mobile target. We evaluate our method\\non a channel state information dataset collected indoors with a distributed\\nsetup of ESPARGOS Wi-Fi sensing antenna arrays. This scenario can be\\ninterpreted as either a multi-static or passive radar system. We demonstrate\\nthat passive channel charting outperforms a baseline based on classical\\ntriangulation in terms of localization accuracy. We discuss our results and\\nhighlight some unsolved issues related to the proposed concept.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,eess.SP,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T06:33:07Z\"}"}
