This\\nwork presents a stochastic geometry framework using point processes (PPs) to\\nmodel multiple randomly deployed RISs conditioned on their associated base\\nstation (BS) locations. By characterizing aggregated reflections from multiple\\nRISs using the Laplace transform, we analytically assess the performance impact\\nof RIS-reflected signals by integrating this characterization into\\nwell-established stochastic geometry frameworks. Specifically, we derive\\nclosed-form expressions for the Laplace transform of the reflected signal power\\nin several deployment scenarios. These analytical results facilitate\\nperformance evaluation of RIS-enabled enhancements. Numerical simulations\\nvalidate that optimal RIS placement favors proximity to BSs or user equipment\\n(UEs), and further quantify the impact of reflected interference, various\\nfading assumptions, and diverse spatial deployment strategies. Importantly, our\\nanalytical approach shows superior computational efficiency compared to Monte\\nCarlo simulations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.PF\", \"categories\": \"cs.PF,cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T07:29:32Z\"}"}
