{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09942v1\", \"title\": \"Fully-Adaptive and Semi-Adaptive Frequency Sweep Algorithm Exploiting\\n  Loewner-State Model for EM Simulation of Multiport Systems\", \"summary\": \"This paper employs a fully adaptive and semi-adaptive frequency sweep\\nalgorithm using the Loewner matrix-based state model for the electromagnetic\\nsimulation. The proposed algorithms use two Loewner matrix models with\\ndifferent or the same orders with small frequency perturbation for adaptive\\nfrequency selection. The error between the two models is calculated in each\\niteration, and the next frequency points are selected to minimize maximum\\nerror. With the help of memory, the algorithm terminates when the error between\\nthe model and the simulation result is reached within the specified error\\ntolerance. In the fully adaptive frequency sweep algorithm, the method starts\\nwith the minimum and maximum frequency of simulation. In the semi-adaptive\\nalgorithm, a novel approach has been proposed to determine the initial number\\nof frequency points necessary for system interpolation based on the electrical\\nsize of the structure. The proposed algorithms have been compared with the\\nStoer-Bulirsch algorithm and Pradovera's minimal sampling algorithm for\\nelectromagnetic simulation. Four examples are presented using MATLAB R2024b.\\nThe results show that the proposed methods offer better performance in terms of\\nspeed, accuracy and the requirement of the minimum number of frequency samples.\\nThe proposed method shows remarkable consistency with full-wave simulation\\ndata, and the algorithm can be effectively applicable to electromagnetic\\nsimulations.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP,cs.SY,eess.SY,G.1.1\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T07:05:14Z\"}"}
