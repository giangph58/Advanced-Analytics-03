{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21466v1\", \"title\": \"Semantic-aided Parallel Image Transmission Compatible with Practical\\n  System\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we propose a novel semantic-aided image communication\\nframework for supporting the compatibility with practical separation-based\\ncoding architectures. Particularly, the deep learning (DL)-based joint\\nsource-channel coding (JSCC) is integrated into the classical separate\\nsource-channel coding (SSCC) to transmit the images via the combination of\\nsemantic stream and image stream from DL networks and SSCC respectively, which\\nwe name as parallel-stream transmission. The positive coding gain stems from\\nthe sophisticated design of the JSCC encoder, which leverages the residual\\ninformation neglected by the SSCC to enhance the learnable image features.\\nFurthermore, a conditional rate adaptation mechanism is introduced to adjust\\nthe transmission rate of semantic stream according to residual, rendering the\\nframework more flexible and efficient to bandwidth allocation. We also design a\\ndynamic stream aggregation strategy at the receiver, which provides the\\ncomposite framework with more robustness to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\\nfluctuations in wireless systems compared to a single conventional codec.\\nFinally, the proposed framework is verified to surpass the performance of both\\ntraditional and DL-based competitors in a large range of scenarios and\\nmeanwhile, maintains lightweight in terms of the transmission and computational\\ncomplexity of semantic stream, which exhibits the potential to be applied in\\nreal systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T09:41:16Z\"}"}
