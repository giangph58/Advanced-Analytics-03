However, these protocols introduce new security challenges,\\nparticularly; tool squatting; the deceptive registration or representation of\\ntools. This paper analyzes tool squatting threats within the context of\\nemerging interoperability standards, such as Model Context Protocol (MCP) or\\nseamless communication between agents protocols. It introduces a comprehensive\\nTool Registry system designed to mitigate these risks. We propose a\\nsecurity-focused architecture featuring admin-controlled registration,\\ncentralized tool discovery, fine grained access policies enforced via dedicated\\nAgent and Tool Registry services, a dynamic trust scoring mechanism based on\\ntool versioning and known vulnerabilities, and just in time credential\\nprovisioning. Based on its design principles, the proposed registry framework\\naims to effectively prevent common tool squatting vectors while preserving the\\nflexibility and power of multi-agent systems. This work addresses a critical\\nsecurity gap in the rapidly evolving GenAI ecosystem and provides a foundation\\nfor secure tool integration in production environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:22:21Z\"}"}
