While they already offer\\nsignificant compression compared to full packet captures, their sheer volume\\nremains daunting, especially for large Internet Service Providers (ISPs). In\\nthis paper, we investigate several lossy compression techniques to further\\nreduce storage requirements while preserving the utility of flow records for\\nkey tasks, such as predicting the domain name of contacted servers. Our study\\nevaluates scalar quantization, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and vector\\nquantization, applied to a real-world dataset from an operational campus\\nnetwork. Results reveal that scalar quantization provides the best tradeoff\\nbetween compression and accuracy. PCA can preserve predictive accuracy but\\nhampers subsequent entropic compression, and while vector quantization shows\\npromise, it struggles with scalability due to the high-dimensional nature of\\nthe data. These findings result in practical strategies for optimizing flow\\nrecord storage in large-scale monitoring scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:11:59Z\"}"}
