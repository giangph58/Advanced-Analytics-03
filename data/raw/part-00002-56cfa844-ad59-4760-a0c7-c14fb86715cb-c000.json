Using odor fields from direct numerical\\nsimulations of the Navier-Stokes equations, we demonstrate that heterogeneous\\ngroups, with exploratory and exploitative agents, consistently outperform\\nhomogeneous swarms where the exploration-exploitation tradeoff is managed at\\nthe individual level. Our results reveal that policy diversity enables the\\ngroup to reach the odor source more efficiently by mitigating the detrimental\\neffects of spatial correlations in the signal. These findings provide new\\ninsights into collective search behavior in biological systems and offer\\npromising strategies for the design of robust, bioinspired search algorithms in\\nengineered systems.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn,physics.comp-ph,physics.data-an\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:31:11Z\"}"}
