However, IFC data can be very\\ncomplicated because it allows for multiple ways to represent the same product\\ninformation. In this research, we utilise the capabilities of LLMs to parse the\\nIFC data with Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph-RAG) technique to\\nretrieve building object properties and their relations. We will show that,\\ndespite limitations due to the complex hierarchy of the IFC data, the Graph-RAG\\nparsing enhances generative LLMs like GPT-4o with graph-based knowledge,\\nenabling natural language query-response retrieval without the need for a\\ncomplex pipeline.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:31:11Z\"}"}
