The economic reality generates the problems the\\nsolution of that is only possible by a new paradigm of the description of\\neconomy system. The classical mathematical economics is based on a notion of\\nthe rational consumer choice generated by a certain preference relation on some\\nset of goods a consumer wanted and the concept of maximization of the firm\\nprofit. The sense of the notion of the ratio- nal consumer choice is that it is\\ndetermined by a certain utility function, defining the choice of a consumer by\\nmaximization of it on a certain budget set of goods. More- over, choices of\\nconsumers are independent. In the reality choices of consumers are not\\nindependent because they depend on the firms supply. Except the firms supply,\\nthe consumer choice is also determined by information about the state of the\\neconomy system that the consumer has and respectively eval- uates at the moment\\nof the choice. In turn, the firms supply is made on the basis of needs of the\\nconsumers and their buying power. By information about the state of the economy\\nsystem we understand a certain information about the equilibrium price vector\\nand productive processes realized in the economy system under the equilibrium\\nprice vector.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.MF\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.MF\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:05:39Z\"}"}
