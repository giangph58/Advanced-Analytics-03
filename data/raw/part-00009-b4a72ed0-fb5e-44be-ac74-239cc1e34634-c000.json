The growing demand for efficient, real-time detection\\nhas created challenges in identifying small targets in complex environments due\\nto interference. To address this, we propose a small target detection method\\nbased on multi-modal image fusion and attention mechanisms. This method\\nleverages YOLOv5, integrating infrared and visible light data along with a\\nconvolutional attention module to enhance detection performance. The process\\nbegins with multi-modal dataset registration using feature point matching,\\nensuring accurate network training. By combining infrared and visible light\\nfeatures with attention mechanisms, the model improves detection accuracy and\\nrobustness. Experimental results on anti-UAV and Visdrone datasets demonstrate\\nthe effectiveness and practicality of our approach, achieving superior\\ndetection results for small and dim targets.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:02:10Z\"}"}
