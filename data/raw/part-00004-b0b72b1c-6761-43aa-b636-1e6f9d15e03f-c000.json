{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19842v1\", \"title\": \"Near-Optimal Minimum Cuts in Hypergraphs at Scale\", \"summary\": \"The hypergraph minimum cut problem aims to partition its vertices into two\\nblocks while minimizing the total weight of the cut hyperedges. This\\nfundamental problem arises in network reliability, VLSI design, and community\\ndetection. We present HeiCut, a scalable algorithm for computing near-optimal\\nminimum cuts in both unweighted and weighted hypergraphs. HeiCut aggressively\\nreduces the hypergraph size through a sequence of provably exact reductions\\nthat preserve the minimum cut, along with an optional heuristic contraction\\nbased on label propagation. It then solves a relaxed Binary Integer Linear\\nProgram (BIP) on the reduced hypergraph to compute a near-optimal minimum cut.\\nOur extensive evaluation on over 500 real-world hypergraphs shows that HeiCut\\ncomputes the exact minimum cut in over 85% of instances using our exact\\nreductions alone, and offers the best solution quality across all instances. It\\nsolves over twice as many instances as the state-of-the-art within set\\ncomputational limits, and is up to five orders of magnitude faster.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:41:51Z\"}"}
