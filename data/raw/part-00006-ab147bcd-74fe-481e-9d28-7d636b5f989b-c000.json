Thus, the measured\\npeculiar velocities of NS high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) provide valuable\\nclues to natal kicks, which also play an important role in the evolution of\\nHMXBs. In this work, we collect proper motions, radial velocities and\\nparallaxes for 36 NS HMXBs to derive their peculiar velocities at the birth of\\nthe NSs. We then use binary population synthesis to simulate the velocities of\\nNS HMXBs with various choices of the kick velocity distribution for both\\ncore-collapse and electron-capture supernovae. Comparing the simulated and\\nmeasured velocities, orbital periods, and eccentricities, we show that the\\nnatal kick distribution that can best match the observations is characterized\\nby a bimodal Maxwellian distribution with $\\\\sigma_1$ = 320 km s$^{-1}$ (for\\ncore-collapse supernovae) and $\\\\sigma_2$ = 80 km s$^{-1}$ (for electron-capture\\nsupernovae) and the He core mass for the latter in the range of $(1.83-2.25)$\\n$M_{\\\\odot}$. Our findings provide useful insights for further population\\nsynthesis and binary evolution studies of NS binaries.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T10:57:36Z\"}"}
