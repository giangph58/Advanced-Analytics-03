{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11123v1\", \"title\": \"Compositional Effects on Structure, Dynamics, Thermodynamic and\\n  Mechanical Properties of Zr-Cu-Al alloys\", \"summary\": \"Zr-Cu-Al alloys belong to a commercially important family of CuZr-based\\nalloys that form bulk metallic glasses on microalloying of Al. However, the\\nidentification of compositions with good glass-forming ability and desirable\\nproperties from a vast compositional space remains a major challenge due to\\ncomplex compositional effects on the structure, dynamics and properties. In the\\npresent work, we report molecular dynamic investigations of structure,\\ndynamics, thermodynamic and mechanical properties of Zr$_{50}$Cu$_{50-x}$Al$_x$\\nand Cu$_{50}$Zr$_{50-x}$Al$_x$ alloys ($x=5,10,15,20,25,30,40$) covering a wide\\ncompositional space. Our results and findings lead to some important\\nconclusions that could serve as overarching guidelines for choosing good\\nglass-forming alloy compositions that give Zr-Cu-Al glasses with tailored\\nthermal and mechanical properties. Overall, present results suggest that a good\\nglass-forming Zr-Cu-Al alloy composition leading to an MG with good thermal and\\nmechanical properties should be Cu-rich with Zr concentration in the window\\n30\\\\%-35\\\\% and Al\\\\% > 20. Our results also highlight the impact of icosahedral\\nshort- and medium-range ordering on the dynamics and mechanical properties of\\nthe alloys. It is observed that the fractions of the full icosahedra $\\\\langle\\n0,0,12,0 \\\\rangle$ and the degree of their interconnectivity are directly\\ncorrelated to the structural relaxation, diffusion, dynamic heterogeneity and\\nmechanical properties.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.dis-nn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T12:12:34Z\"}"}
