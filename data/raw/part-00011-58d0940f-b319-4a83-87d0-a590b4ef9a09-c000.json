Our analysis reveals that a\\nnon-differentiable nature of spacetime is not merely compatible with quantum\\nfield theory but significantly enhances its mathematical foundation. Most\\nnotably, this approach guarantees the finiteness of the theory at all orders in\\nperturbation theory and enables rigorous construction of the S-matrix in the\\ninteraction picture. The multifractal structure tames dominant, large-order\\ndivergence sources in the perturbative series and resolves the Landau pole\\nproblem through asymptotic safety, substantially improving the theory's\\nbehavior in the deep ultraviolet regime. Our formulation preserves all\\nestablished predictions of standard quantum field theory at low energies while\\noffering novel physical behaviors at high energy scales.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T11:41:15Z\"}"}
