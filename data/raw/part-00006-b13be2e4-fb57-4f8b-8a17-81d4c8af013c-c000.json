{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15729v1\", \"title\": \"Strong discrete Morse theory\", \"summary\": \"The purpose of this work is to develop a version of Forman's discrete Morse\\ntheory for simplicial complexes, based on internal strong collapses. Classical\\ndiscrete Morse theory can be viewed as a generalization of Whitehead's\\ncollapses, where each Morse function on a simplicial complex $K$ defines a\\nsequence of elementary internal collapses. This reduction guarantees the\\nexistence of a CW-complex that is homotopy equivalent to $K$, with cells\\ncorresponding to the critical simplices of the Morse function. However, this\\napproach lacks an explicit combinatorial description of the attaching maps,\\nwhich limits the reconstruction of the homotopy type of $K$. By restricting\\ndiscrete Morse functions to those induced by total orders on the vertices, we\\ndevelop a strong discrete Morse theory, generalizing the strong collapses\\nintroduced by Barmak and Minian. We show that, in this setting, the resulting\\nreduced CW-complex is regular, enabling us to recover its homotopy type\\ncombinatorially. We also provide an algorithm to compute this reduction and\\napply it to obtain efficient structures for complexes in the library of\\ntriangulations by Benedetti and Lutz.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AT\", \"categories\": \"math.AT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T09:23:45Z\"}"}
