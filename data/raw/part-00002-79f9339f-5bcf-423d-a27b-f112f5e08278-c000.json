In\\nparticular, our results can be seen as a generalization of the limit operator\\nconcept to the non-discrete world. Moreover, we briefly discuss property $A'$\\nfor arbitrary locally compact abelian groups.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA,math.OA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T11:03:33Z\"}"}
