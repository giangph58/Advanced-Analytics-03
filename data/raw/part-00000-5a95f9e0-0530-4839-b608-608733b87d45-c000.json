We compute the transition\\nprobabilities and geometric phase differences accounting for the full many-body\\ndynamics and show that qubit states can be read out by fusing the vortex core\\nMZMs and measuring the resulting charge density. We visualize the gate\\nprocesses using the time- and energy-dependent non-equilibrium local density of\\nstates. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of employing vortex core MZMs\\nfor the realization of fault-tolerant topological quantum computing.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T16:03:31Z\"}"}
