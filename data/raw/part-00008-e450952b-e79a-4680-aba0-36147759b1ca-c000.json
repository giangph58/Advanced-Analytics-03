Using a semi-explicit\\nsimilarity transformation method, the momentum equation associated with the\\nStokes stream function is solved. The nonlinear closed analytical solutions for\\nboth stagnation flow and converging flow are derived. The results demonstrate\\nthat the boundary layer structure incorporates similar shock and solitary wave\\ncomponents which are promoted by Lorentz force. Under extreme magnetic fields,\\nthe flow exhibits sine and cosine wave patterns, which are motivated by the\\nstrong Lorentz force. An in-depth asymptotic analysis establishes the square\\nroot scaling laws that quantify the growth of friction and flux with increasing\\nmagnetic field strength. The boundary layer thickness scales inversely with the\\nHartmann number, a consequence of dominant Lorentz force, which differs from\\nthe conclusion of duct flow (Hunt 1965). These findings elucidate the physical\\nmechanisms governing the nonlinear coupling between magnetic fields and the\\ndynamics of the boundary layer.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T04:39:32Z\"}"}
