While this\\nduality has been rigorously formulated for the closed topological string\\nsector, the open string sector remains less understood. Building on the results\\nof [1-3], we make further progress in this direction by constructing entire,\\noff-shell eigenfunctions for the quantized mirror curve from open topological\\nstring partition functions. We focus on local $\\\\mathbb{F}_0$, whose mirror\\ncurve corresponds to the Baxter equation of the two-particle, relativistic Toda\\nlattice. We then study the standard and dual four-dimensional limits, where the\\nquantum mirror curve for local $\\\\mathbb{F}_0$ degenerates into the modified\\nMathieu and McCoy-Tracy-Wu operators, respectively. In these limits, our\\nframework provides a way to construct entire, off-shell eigenfunctions for the\\ndifference equations associated with these operators. Furthermore, we find a\\nsimple relation between the on-shell eigenfunctions of the modified Mathieu and\\nMcCoy-Tracy-Wu operators, leading to a functional relation between the\\noperators themselves.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,math-ph,math.MP,math.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:57:37Z\"}"}
