{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00566v1\", \"title\": \"Non-Hermitian band topology in twisted bilayer graphene aligned with\\n  hexagonal boron nitride\", \"summary\": \"Utilizing the established Bistritzer-MacDonald model for twisted bilayer\\ngraphene (tBLG), we theoretically investigate the non-Hermitian (NH)\\ntopological properties of this in the presence of non-reciprocal (NR) hopping\\non both layers and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) induced mass term incorporated\\nonly on the top layer of the tBLG system. It is well known that the hBN mass\\nterm breaks the $C_{2}$ symmetry of tBLG and gaps out the Dirac cones inducing\\na valley Hall insulating phase. However, when NR hopping is introduced, this\\nsystem transits into a NH valley Hall insulator (NH-VHI). Our analysis reveals\\nthat, in the chiral limit, the bandwidth of the system vanishes under NH\\neffects for a wide range of twist angles. Such range can be visibly expanded as\\nwe enhance the degree of non-Hermiticity $(\\\\beta)$. At the magic angle, we\\nobserve that enhancement of $\\\\beta$ inflates the robustness of the gapless\\nDirac points, requiring a progressively larger mass term to induce a gap in the\\nNH tBLG system. Additionally, for a fixed NH parameter, we identify a range of\\ntwist angles where gap formation is significantly obstructed. To explore the\\ntopological aspects of the NH tBLG, we analyze the direct band gap in the\\nMoir\\\\'e Brillouin zone (mBZ) and compute the Chern number for the NH system. We\\nfind that the corresponding topological phase transitions are associated with\\ncorresponding direct band gap closings in the mBZ.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.other\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T14:46:42Z\"}"}
