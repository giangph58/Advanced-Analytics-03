While\\ntraditional clustering techniques, such as hard and fuzzy center-based\\nclustering, have been widely used, they struggle with complex,\\nhigh-dimensional, and non-Euclidean datasets. In particular, the Fuzzy\\n$C$-Means (FCM) algorithm, despite its efficiency and popularity, exhibits\\nnotable limitations in non-Euclidean spaces. Euclidean spaces assume linear\\nseparability and uniform distance scaling, limiting their effectiveness in\\ncapturing complex, hierarchical, or non-Euclidean structures in fuzzy\\nclustering. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Filtration-based\\nHyperbolic Fuzzy $C$-Means (HypeFCM), a novel clustering algorithm tailored for\\nbetter representation of data relationships in non-Euclidean spaces. HypeFCM\\nintegrates the principles of fuzzy clustering with hyperbolic geometry and\\nemploys a weight-based filtering mechanism to improve performance. The\\nalgorithm initializes weights using a Dirichlet distribution and iteratively\\nrefines cluster centroids and membership assignments based on a hyperbolic\\nmetric in the Poincar\\\\'e Disc model. Extensive experimental evaluations\\ndemonstrate that HypeFCM significantly outperforms conventional fuzzy\\nclustering methods in non-Euclidean settings, underscoring its robustness and\\neffectiveness.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T11:32:53Z\"}"}
