As\\nOCR continues to broaden its range of applications, the increased likelihood of\\ninterference introduced by various usage environments can prevent it from\\nachieving its inherent performance. This results in reduced recognition\\naccuracy under certain conditions, and makes the quality control of recognition\\ndevices more challenging. Therefore, to ensure that users can properly utilize\\nOCR, we compiled the real-world external disturbance factors that cause\\nperformance degradation, along with the resulting image degradation phenomena,\\ninto an external disturbance factor table and, by also indicating how to make\\nuse of it, organized them into guidelines.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T07:32:28Z\"}"}
