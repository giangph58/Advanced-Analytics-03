{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12735v1\", \"title\": \"The Athenian Academy: A Seven-Layer Architecture Model for Multi-Agent\\n  Systems\", \"summary\": \"This paper proposes the \\\"Academy of Athens\\\" multi-agent seven-layer\\nframework, aimed at systematically addressing challenges in multi-agent systems\\n(MAS) within artificial intelligence (AI) art creation, such as collaboration\\nefficiency, role allocation, environmental adaptation, and task parallelism.\\nThe framework divides MAS into seven layers: multi-agent collaboration,\\nsingle-agent multi-role playing, single-agent multi-scene traversal,\\nsingle-agent multi-capability incarnation, different single agents using the\\nsame large model to achieve the same target agent, single-agent using different\\nlarge models to achieve the same target agent, and multi-agent synthesis of the\\nsame target agent. Through experimental validation in art creation, the\\nframework demonstrates its unique advantages in task collaboration, cross-scene\\nadaptation, and model fusion. This paper further discusses current challenges\\nsuch as collaboration mechanism optimization, model stability, and system\\nsecurity, proposing future exploration through technologies like meta-learning\\nand federated learning. The framework provides a structured methodology for\\nmulti-agent collaboration in AI art creation and promotes innovative\\napplications in the art field.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MA\", \"categories\": \"cs.MA,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T08:21:28Z\"}"}
