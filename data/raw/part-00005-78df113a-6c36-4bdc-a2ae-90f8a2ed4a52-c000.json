{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12115v1\", \"title\": \"GripMap: An Efficient, Spatially Resolved Constraint Framework for\\n  Offline and Online Trajectory Planning in Autonomous Racing\", \"summary\": \"Conventional trajectory planning approaches for autonomous vehicles often\\nassume a fixed vehicle model that remains constant regardless of the vehicle's\\nlocation. This overlooks the critical fact that the tires and the surface are\\nthe two force-transmitting partners in vehicle dynamics; while the tires stay\\nwith the vehicle, surface conditions vary with location. Recognizing these\\nchallenges, this paper presents a novel framework for spatially resolving\\ndynamic constraints in both offline and online planning algorithms applied to\\nautonomous racing. We introduce the GripMap concept, which provides a spatial\\nresolution of vehicle dynamic constraints in the Frenet frame, allowing\\nadaptation to locally varying grip conditions. This enables compensation for\\nlocation-specific effects, more efficient vehicle behavior, and increased\\nsafety, unattainable with spatially invariant vehicle models. The focus is on\\nlow storage demand and quick access through perfect hashing. This framework\\nproved advantageous in real-world applications in the presented form.\\nExperiments inspired by autonomous racing demonstrate its effectiveness. In\\nfuture work, this framework can serve as a foundational layer for developing\\nfuture interpretable learning algorithms that adjust to varying grip conditions\\nin real-time.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T14:25:29Z\"}"}
