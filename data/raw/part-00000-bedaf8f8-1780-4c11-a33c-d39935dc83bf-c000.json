{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12265v1\", \"title\": \"Correlation Ratio for Unsupervised Learning of Multi-modal Deformable\\n  Registration\", \"summary\": \"In recent years, unsupervised learning for deformable image registration has\\nbeen a major research focus. This approach involves training a registration\\nnetwork using pairs of moving and fixed images, along with a loss function that\\ncombines an image similarity measure and deformation regularization. For\\nmulti-modal image registration tasks, the correlation ratio has been a\\nwidely-used image similarity measure historically, yet it has been\\nunderexplored in current deep learning methods. Here, we propose a\\ndifferentiable correlation ratio to use as a loss function for learning-based\\nmulti-modal deformable image registration. This approach extends the\\ntraditionally non-differentiable implementation of the correlation ratio by\\nusing the Parzen windowing approximation, enabling backpropagation with deep\\nneural networks. We validated the proposed correlation ratio on a multi-modal\\nneuroimaging dataset. In addition, we established a Bayesian training framework\\nto study how the trade-off between the deformation regularizer and similarity\\nmeasures, including mutual information and our proposed correlation ratio,\\naffects the registration performance.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T17:23:44Z\"}"}
