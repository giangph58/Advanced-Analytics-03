The model consists of a Poisson equation in the bulk, a forced mean\\ncurvature flow on the surface, and a coupled velocity law between bulk and\\nsurface. Due to the non-trivial bulk-surface coupling, all previous analyses --\\nwhich exclusively relied on energy-estimate based approaches -- required an\\nadditional regularization term. By adopting the $\\\\widehat{H}^{3/2}$ theory and\\nthe multilinear forms, we develop an essentially new theoretical framework that\\nenables the application of PDE regularity theory to stability analysis. Based\\non this framework, we provide the first rigorous convergence proof for the\\noriginal model without regularization.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T10:00:02Z\"}"}
