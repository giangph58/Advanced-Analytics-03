{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15633v1\", \"title\": \"An analytic redshift-independent formulation of baryonic effects on the\\n  matter power spectrum\", \"summary\": \"Baryonic effects created by feedback processes associated with galaxy\\nformation are an important, poorly constrained systematic effect for models of\\nlarge-scale structure as probed by weak gravitational lensing. Upcoming surveys\\nrequire fast methods to predict and marginalize over the potential impact of\\nbaryons on the total matter power spectrum. Here we use the FLAMINGO\\ncosmological hydrodynamical simulations to test a recent proposal to\\napproximate the matter power spectrum as the sum of the linear matter power\\nspectrum and a constant multiple, $A_{\\\\rm mod}$, of the difference between the\\nlinear and non-linear gravity-only power spectra. We show that replacing this\\nconstant multiple with a one-parameter family of sigmoid functions of the\\nwavenumber $k$ allows to us match the predictions of simulations with different\\nfeedback strengths for $z \\\\leq 1, k < 3~h\\\\cdot{\\\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, and the\\ndifferent cosmological models in the FLAMINGO suite. The baryonic response\\npredicted by FLAMINGO models that use jet-like AGN feedback instead of the\\nfiducial thermally-driven AGN feedback can also be reproduced, but at the cost\\nof increasing the number of parameters in the sigmoid function from one to\\nthree. The assumption that $A_{\\\\rm mod}$ depends only on $k$ breaks down for\\ndecaying dark matter models, highlighting the need for more advanced baryon\\nresponse models when studying cosmological models that deviate strongly from\\n$\\\\Lambda$CDM.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T06:48:25Z\"}"}
