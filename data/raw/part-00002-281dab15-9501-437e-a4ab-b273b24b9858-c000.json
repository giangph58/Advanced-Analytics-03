These engines assign a numerical\\nevaluation $E$ to positions, indicating an advantage for either white or black,\\nbut similar evaluations can mask varying levels of move complexity. While some\\nmove sequences are straightforward, others demand near-perfect play, limiting\\nthe practical value of these evaluations for most players. To quantify this\\nproblem, we use entropy to measure the complexity of the principal variation\\n(the sequence of best moves). Variations with forced moves have low entropy,\\nwhile those with multiple viable alternatives have high entropy. Our results\\nshow that, except for experts, most human players struggle with high-entropy\\nvariations, especially when $|E|<100$ centipawns, which accounts for about\\n$2/3$ of positions. This underscores the need for AI-generated evaluations to\\nconvey the complexity of underlying move sequences, as they often exceed\\ntypical human cognitive capabilities, reducing their practical utility.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph,cond-mat.dis-nn,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T07:27:14Z\"}"}
