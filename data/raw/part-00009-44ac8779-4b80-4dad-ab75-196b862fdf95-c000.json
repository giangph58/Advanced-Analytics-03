{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15071v1\", \"title\": \"Aria-MIDI: A Dataset of Piano MIDI Files for Symbolic Music Modeling\", \"summary\": \"We introduce an extensive new dataset of MIDI files, created by transcribing\\naudio recordings of piano performances into their constituent notes. The data\\npipeline we use is multi-stage, employing a language model to autonomously\\ncrawl and score audio recordings from the internet based on their metadata,\\nfollowed by a stage of pruning and segmentation using an audio classifier. The\\nresulting dataset contains over one million distinct MIDI files, comprising\\nroughly 100,000 hours of transcribed audio. We provide an in-depth analysis of\\nour techniques, offering statistical insights, and investigate the content by\\nextracting metadata tags, which we also provide. Dataset available at\\nhttps://github.com/loubbrad/aria-midi.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SD\", \"categories\": \"cs.SD\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T12:59:40Z\"}"}
