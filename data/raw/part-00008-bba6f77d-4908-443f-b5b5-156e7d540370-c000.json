This\\nstudy leverages 1239 hydrothermal synthesis datapoints from material science as\\na surrogate for natural REE mineralization. We trained machine learning models\\n(KNN, RF, XGBoost) using precursor, additive, and reaction data to predict\\nproduct elements and phases, validating predictions with new experiments.\\nXGBoost exhibited the highest accuracy, with feature importance analysis\\nindicating thermodynamic properties were critical for predictions. Observed\\ncorrelations among reaction parameters aligned with classical crystallization\\ntheory. Further XGBoost models successfully predicted reaction temperature and\\npH from precursor/product data. Our findings demonstrate the cross-disciplinary\\nutility of material science data for geochemical understanding, underscore the\\nneed for research on less-studied REE minerals (e.g., carbonates, heavy REEs),\\nand suggest potential to accelerate REE resource development.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T16:26:21Z\"}"}
