We first discuss the case of a sector\\nin BTZ (Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli) black hole. By rescaling the Newton's\\nconstant we recover the area law of entropy of this sector by microstate\\ncounting. Then we apply this technique to all accelerating BTZ phases in 3D\\nC-metric. Finally, for the boundary entropy in 3D C-metric, we study the\\nmonotonicity of the $g$-function of 3D C-metric in small acceleration limit and\\nfind that the $g$-theorem is satisfied only in $\\\\rm I_{2}$.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T11:37:06Z\"}"}
