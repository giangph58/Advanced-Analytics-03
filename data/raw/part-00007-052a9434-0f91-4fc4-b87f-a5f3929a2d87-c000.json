Building on the recent work \\\\cite{VZ25}, we prove that the diameter of $G_n\\n\\\\sim \\\\operatorname{PA}\\\\!_n^{(m,\\\\delta)}$ is $(1+o(1))\\\\log_\\\\nu n$ with high\\nprobability, where $\\\\nu$ is the exponential growth rate of the local weak limit\\nof $G_n$. Our result confirms the conjecture in \\\\cite{VZ25} and closes the\\nremaining gap in understanding the asymptotic diameter of preferential\\nattachment graphs with general parameters $m \\\\ge 1$ and $\\\\delta >-m$. Our proof\\nfollows a general recipe that relates the diameter of a random graph to its\\ntypical distance, which we expect to have applicability in a broader range of\\nmodels.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T15:38:50Z\"}"}
