{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03360v1\", \"title\": \"Hierarchical dynamic domain decomposition for the multiscale Boltzmann\\n  equation\", \"summary\": \"In this work, we present a hierarchical domain decomposition method for the\\nmulti-scale Boltzmann equation based on moment realizability matrices, a\\nconcept introduced by Levermore, Morokoff, and Nadiga in\\n\\\\cite{lev-mor-nad-1998}. This criterion is used to dynamically partition the\\ntwo-dimensional spatial domain into three regimes: the Euler regime, an\\nintermediate kinetic regime governed by the ES-BGK model, and the full\\nBoltzmann regime. The key advantage of this approach lies in the use of Euler\\nequations in regions where the flow is near hydrodynamic equilibrium, the\\nES-BGK model in moderately non-equilibrium regions where a fluid description is\\ninsufficient but full kinetic resolution is not yet necessary, and the full\\nBoltzmann solver where strong non-equilibrium effects dominate, such as near\\nshocks and boundary layers. This allows for both high accuracy and significant\\ncomputational savings, as the Euler solver and the ES-BGK models are\\nconsiderably cheaper than the full kinetic Boltzmann model.\\n  To ensure accurate and efficient coupling between regimes, we employ\\nasymptotic-preserving (AP) numerical schemes and fast spectral solvers for\\nevaluating the Boltzmann collision operator. Among the main novelties of this\\nwork are the use of a full 2D spatial and 3D velocity decomposition, the\\nintegration of three distinct physical regimes within a unified solver\\nframework, and a parallelized implementation exploiting CPU multithreading.\\nThis combination enables robust and scalable simulation of multiscale kinetic\\nflows with complex geometries.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T09:29:37Z\"}"}
