{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21831v1\", \"title\": \"Early Exit and Multi Stage Knowledge Distillation in VLMs for Video\\n  Summarization\", \"summary\": \"We introduce DEEVISum (Distilled Early Exit Vision language model for\\nSummarization), a lightweight, efficient, and scalable vision language model\\ndesigned for segment wise video summarization. Leveraging multi modal prompts\\nthat combine textual and audio derived signals, DEEVISum incorporates Multi\\nStage Knowledge Distillation (MSKD) and Early Exit (EE) to strike a balance\\nbetween performance and efficiency. MSKD offers a 1.33% absolute F1 improvement\\nover baseline distillation (0.5%), while EE reduces inference time by\\napproximately 21% with a 1.3 point drop in F1. Evaluated on the TVSum dataset,\\nour best model PaLI Gemma2 3B + MSKD achieves an F1 score of 61.1, competing\\nthe performance of significantly larger models, all while maintaining a lower\\ncomputational footprint. We publicly release our code and processed dataset to\\nsupport further research.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:37:55Z\"}"}
