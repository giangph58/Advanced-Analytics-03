Using the commercial ion\\nsimulation package SIMION, it is shown that the weightage of the octupole and\\nhexadecapole potential increases with an increase in the asymmetry factor. A\\nconsistent correlation is observed between the octupole and dodecapole\\ncomponents, and between the hexadecapole and icosapole components with\\nasymmetry added to different rod-to-field radius ratios. The transmission\\ncharacteristics of the mass filter are studied for different asymmetry factors\\nand rod-to-field radius ratios. The variation in the resolution parameter, as\\nderived from the transmission contour, exhibits a strong correlation with the\\ncombined weightage of the multipole fields.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:11:54Z\"}"}
