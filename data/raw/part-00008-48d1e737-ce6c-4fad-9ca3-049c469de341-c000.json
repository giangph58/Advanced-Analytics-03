A Morse sequence is a\\nfiltration from a subcomplex L to a complex K via elementary expansions and\\nfillings, naturally encoding critical and regular simplexes. Maximal increasing\\nand minimal decreasing schemes allow constructing these sequences, and are\\nlinked to algorithms like Random Discrete Morse and Coreduction. Extending the\\napproach to cosimplicial complexes (S = K \\\\ L), we define operations --\\nreductions, perforations, coreductions, and coperforations -- for efficient\\ncomputation. We further generalize to F -sequences, which are Morse sequences\\nweighted by an arbitrary stack function F , and provide algorithms to compute\\nmaximal and minimal sequences. A particular case is when the stack function is\\ngiven through a vertex map, as it is common in topological data analysis. We\\nshow that we retrieve existing methods when the vertex map is injective; in\\nthis case, the complex partitions into lower stars, facilitating parallel\\nprocessing. Thus, this paper proposes simple, flexible, and computationally\\nefficient approaches to obtain Morse sequences from arbitrary stack functions,\\nallowing to generalize previous approaches dedicated to computing gradient\\nvector fields from injective vertex maps.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DM\", \"categories\": \"cs.DM,math.AT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T07:48:31Z\"}"}
