In this work, we evaluate\\nproduction of electron-positron pair production cross section with GDR.\\nSpecifically, we focus on Au+Au collisions at a center of mass energy of\\n$\\\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 200 GeV and Pb+Pb collisions of $\\\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 2.76 TeV per\\nnucleon. We calculate cross sections while taking into account with and without\\nthe kinematic restrictions relevant to STAR detectors. We also present the\\ndifferential cross sections in terms of the variables rapidity $(y)$,\\ntransverse momentum ($p_\\\\perp$) and invariant mass ($M$) to compare them with\\nrespect to RHIC and LHC energies.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:46:07Z\"}"}
