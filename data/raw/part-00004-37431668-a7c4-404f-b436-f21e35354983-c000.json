{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10323v1\", \"title\": \"Rel: A Programming Language for Relational Data\", \"summary\": \"From the moment of their inception, languages for relational data have been\\ndescribed as sublanguages embedded in a host programming language. Rel is a new\\nrelational language whose key design goal is to go beyond this paradigm with\\nfeatures that allow for programming in the large, making it possible to fully\\ndescribe end to end application semantics. With the new approach we can model\\nthe semantics of entire enterprise applications relationally, which helps\\nsignificantly reduce architecture complexity and avoid the well-known impedance\\nmismatch problem. This paradigm shift is enabled by 50 years of database\\nresearch, making it possible to revisit the sublanguage/host language paradigm,\\nstarting from the fundamental principles. We present the main features of Rel:\\nthose that give it the power to express traditional query language operations\\nand those that are designed to grow the language and allow programming in the\\nlarge.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DB\", \"categories\": \"cs.DB,cs.PL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T15:32:47Z\"}"}
