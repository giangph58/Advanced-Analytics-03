{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04566v1\", \"title\": \"Multitask LSTM for Arboviral Outbreak Prediction Using Public Health\\n  Data\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents a multitask learning approach based on long-short-term\\nmemory (LSTM) networks for the joint prediction of arboviral outbreaks and case\\ncounts of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in Recife, Brazil. Leveraging\\nhistorical public health data from DataSUS (2017-2023), the proposed model\\nconcurrently performs binary classification (outbreak detection) and regression\\n(case forecasting) tasks. A sliding window strategy was adopted to construct\\ntemporal features using varying input lengths (60, 90, and 120 days), with\\nhyperparameter optimization carried out using Keras Tuner. Model evaluation\\nused time series cross-validation for robustness and a held-out test from 2023\\nfor generalization assessment. The results show that longer windows improve\\ndengue regression accuracy, while classification performance peaked at\\nintermediate windows, suggesting an optimal trade-off between sequence length\\nand generalization. The multitask architecture delivers competitive performance\\nacross diseases and tasks, demonstrating the feasibility and advantages of\\nunified modeling strategies for scalable epidemic forecasting in data-limited\\npublic health scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T16:58:18Z\"}"}
