To reveal the impacts of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and\\nblock-length on latency in communications, we propose a new metric named secure\\nlatency (SL) and derive the expressions for the effective secure probability\\n(ESP) and the average SL. To minimize the average SL, different transmission\\ndesigns are analyzed, in which the optimal solutions of SNR and block-length\\nare provided. Numerical results validate our analysis and reveal the trade-off\\nbetween reliability and security and the impacts of the block-length, SNR, and\\npacket-generating rate on average SL, of which SNR and the block-length account\\nfor main factors. In addition, we find that the performance of SL can be\\nenhanced by allocating less SNR.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T06:40:28Z\"}"}
