{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05720v1\", \"title\": \"QEMesh: Employing A Quadric Error Metrics-Based Representation for Mesh\\n  Generation\", \"summary\": \"Mesh generation plays a crucial role in 3D content creation, as mesh is\\nwidely used in various industrial applications. Recent works have achieved\\nimpressive results but still face several issues, such as unrealistic patterns\\nor pits on surfaces, thin parts missing, and incomplete structures. Most of\\nthese problems stem from the choice of shape representation or the capabilities\\nof the generative network. To alleviate these, we extend PoNQ, a Quadric Error\\nMetrics (QEM)-based representation, and propose a novel model, QEMesh, for\\nhigh-quality mesh generation. PoNQ divides the shape surface into tiny patches,\\neach represented by a point with its normal and QEM matrix, which preserves\\nfine local geometry information. In our QEMesh, we regard these elements as\\ngenerable parameters and design a unique latent diffusion model containing a\\nnovel multi-decoder VAE for PoNQ parameters generation. Given the latent code\\ngenerated by the diffusion model, three parameter decoders produce several PoNQ\\nparameters within each voxel cell, and an occupancy decoder predicts which\\nvoxel cells containing parameters to form the final shape. Extensive\\nevaluations demonstrate that our method generates results with watertight\\nsurfaces and is comparable to state-of-the-art methods in several main metrics.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T06:40:56Z\"}"}
