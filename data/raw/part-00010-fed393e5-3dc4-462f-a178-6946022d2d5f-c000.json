{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09899v1\", \"title\": \"Digital Staining with Knowledge Distillation: A Unified Framework for\\n  Unpaired and Paired-But-Misaligned Data\", \"summary\": \"Staining is essential in cell imaging and medical diagnostics but poses\\nsignificant challenges, including high cost, time consumption, labor intensity,\\nand irreversible tissue alterations. Recent advances in deep learning have\\nenabled digital staining through supervised model training. However, collecting\\nlarge-scale, perfectly aligned pairs of stained and unstained images remains\\ndifficult. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised deep learning\\nframework for digital cell staining that reduces the need for extensive paired\\ndata using knowledge distillation. We explore two training schemes: (1)\\nunpaired and (2) paired-but-misaligned settings. For the unpaired case, we\\nintroduce a two-stage pipeline, comprising light enhancement followed by\\ncolorization, as a teacher model. Subsequently, we obtain a student staining\\ngenerator through knowledge distillation with hybrid non-reference losses. To\\nleverage the pixel-wise information between adjacent sections, we further\\nextend to the paired-but-misaligned setting, adding the Learning to Align\\nmodule to utilize pixel-level information. Experiment results on our dataset\\ndemonstrate that our proposed unsupervised deep staining method can generate\\nstained images with more accurate positions and shapes of the cell targets in\\nboth settings. Compared with competing methods, our method achieves improved\\nresults both qualitatively and quantitatively (e.g., NIQE and PSNR).We applied\\nour digital staining method to the White Blood Cell (WBC) dataset,\\ninvestigating its potential for medical applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,eess.IV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T05:48:05Z\"}"}
