{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19647v1\", \"title\": \"Resonances and computations\", \"summary\": \"The computation of time dynamics arising in nonlinear time-dependent partial\\ndifferential equations is an ongoing challenge in numerical analysis,\\nespecially once roughness comes into play. Classical numerical schemes in\\ngeneral fail to resolve the oscillatory behaviour in the solution which leads\\nto numerical instabilities and loss of convergence. Dispersive equations, e.g.,\\nnonlinear Schr\\\\\\\"odinger, Korteweg--de Vries and wave equations, thereby pose in\\nparticular a big problem as in contrast to the parabolic setting, no strong\\nsmoothing can be expected, i.e., if the initial data is rough, the solution\\nstays rough which makes their approximation a delicate task. In this review we\\ngive an overview on a new numerical ansatz which aims to tackle the time\\ndynamics of nonlinear dispersive partial differential equations even for very\\nrough data. This is achieved by a resonance analysis and decorated tree\\nformalism that draws its inpiration from the combinatorics used in the theory\\nof regularity structures for solving singular SPDEs. One can hope to see this\\nformalism applied in other contexts for dispersive PDEs and beyond.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA,math.AP,math.RA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T10:04:48Z\"}"}
