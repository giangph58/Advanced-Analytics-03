{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12816v1\", \"title\": \"SMARTe: Slot-based Method for Accountable Relational Triple extraction\", \"summary\": \"Relational Triple Extraction (RTE) is a fundamental task in Natural Language\\nProcessing (NLP). However, prior research has primarily focused on optimizing\\nmodel performance, with limited efforts to understand the internal mechanisms\\ndriving these models. Many existing methods rely on complex preprocessing to\\ninduce specific interactions, often resulting in opaque systems that may not\\nfully align with their theoretical foundations. To address these limitations,\\nwe propose SMARTe: a Slot-based Method for Accountable Relational Triple\\nextraction. SMARTe introduces intrinsic interpretability through a slot\\nattention mechanism and frames the task as a set prediction problem. Slot\\nattention consolidates relevant information into distinct slots, ensuring all\\npredictions can be explicitly traced to learned slot representations and the\\ntokens contributing to each predicted relational triple. While emphasizing\\ninterpretability, SMARTe achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art\\nmodels. Evaluations on the NYT and WebNLG datasets demonstrate that adding\\ninterpretability does not compromise performance. Furthermore, we conducted\\nqualitative assessments to showcase the explanations provided by SMARTe, using\\nattention heatmaps that map to their respective tokens. We conclude with a\\ndiscussion of our findings and propose directions for future research.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T10:21:15Z\"}"}
