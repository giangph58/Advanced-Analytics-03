In these setups, a detector monitors the\\ntarget site and the walker motion is restarted if the detector has not clicked\\nafter a fixed time interval. The optimal resetting rate can be extracted from\\nthe time evolution of the probability $S(t)$ that the detector has not clicked\\nup to time $t$. We analyse $S(t)$ for a quantum walk in a one-dimensional\\nlattice when the coupling between sites decays algebraically as $d^{-\\\\alpha}$\\nwith the distance $d$, for $\\\\alpha\\\\in(0,\\\\infty)$. At long-times, $S(t)$ decays\\nwith a universal power-law exponent that is independent of $\\\\alpha$. At short\\ntimes, $S(t)$ exhibits a plethora of phase transitions as a function of\\n$\\\\alpha$. These lead to the identification of two main regimes for the optimal\\nresetting rate. For $\\\\alpha>1$, the resetting rate $r$ is bounded from below by\\nthe velocity with which information propagates causally across the lattice. For\\n$\\\\alpha<1$, instead, the long-range hopping tends to localise the walker: The\\noptimal resetting rate depends on the size of the lattice and diverges as\\n$\\\\alpha\\\\to 0$. We derive simple models reproducing the numerical results,\\nshedding light on the interplay of long-range coherent dynamics, symmetries,\\nand local quantum measurement processes in determining equilibrium. Our\\npredictions can be verified in existing experimental setups.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T13:08:42Z\"}"}
