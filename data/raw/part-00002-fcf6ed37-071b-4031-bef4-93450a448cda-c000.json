It has been suggested that SNe Ia may be resulted\\nfrom thermonuclear explosions of hybrid carbon-oxygen-neon white dwarfs(CONe\\nWDs) when they grow in mass to approach the Chandrasekhar mass limit by\\naccreting matter from a binary main-sequence (MS) companion. In this work, we\\ncombine the results of detailed binary evolution calculations with population\\nsynthesis models to investigate the rates and delay times of SNe Ia in the CONe\\nWD + MS channel at low metallicity environment of Z = 0.0001. For a constant\\nstar formation rate of 5 M_sun yr-1, our calculations predict that the SN Ia\\nrates in the CONe WD + MS channel at low metallicity of Z = 0.0001 is about\\n0.11 - 3.89 * 10-4 yr-1. In addition,delay times in this channel cover a wide\\nrange of 0.05 - 2.5 Gyr. We further compare our results to those given by\\nprevious study for the CONe WD + MS channel with higher metallicity of Z = 0.02\\nto explore the influence of metallicity on the results. We find that these two\\nmetallicity environments give a slight difference in rates and delay times of\\nSNe Ia from the CONe WD + MS channel, although SNe Ia produced at low\\nmetallicity environment of Z = 0.0001 have relatively longer delay times.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T07:03:02Z\"}"}
