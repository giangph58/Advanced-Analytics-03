We solve these equations\\nexactly for infinite~$d$-regular hypernetworks, and obtain an explicit solution\\nfor the expected infection level as a function of time. The solution shows that\\nthe epidemic spreads out to the entire population as~$t \\\\to \\\\infty$ if and only\\nif the initial infection level exceeds a positive threshold value. This phase\\ntransition is a high-order interactions effect, which is absent with pairwise\\ninteractions.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T07:09:57Z\"}"}
