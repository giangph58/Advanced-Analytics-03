This problem is a common\\ngeneralization of \\\\textsc{Max-Weight Independent Set}, \\\\textsc{Odd Cycle\\nTransversal} and \\\\textsc{List $r$-Coloring}, among others. Our result has\\nseveral consequences.\\n  First, it implies that, for every fixed $r \\\\geq 5$, assuming $\\\\mathsf{P}\\\\neq\\n\\\\mathsf{NP}$, \\\\textsc{Max-Weight List $r$-Colorable Induced Subgraph} is\\npolynomial-time solvable on $H$-free graphs if and only if $H$ is an induced\\nsubgraph of either $kP_3$ or $P_5+kP_1$, for some $k \\\\geq 1$. Second, it makes\\nconsiderable progress toward a complexity dichotomy for \\\\textsc{Odd Cycle\\nTransversal} on $H$-free graphs, allowing to answer a question of Agrawal,\\nLima, Lokshtanov, Rz{\\\\k{a}}{\\\\.z}ewski, Saurabh, and Sharma [TALG 2024]. Third,\\nit gives a short and self-contained proof of the known result of Chudnovsky,\\nHajebi, and Spirkl [Combinatorica 2024] that \\\\textsc{List $r$-Coloring} on\\n$kP_3$-free graphs is polynomial-time solvable for every fixed $r$ and $k$.\\n  We also consider two natural distance-$d$ generalizations of\\n\\\\textsc{Max-Weight Independent Set} and \\\\textsc{List $r$-Coloring} and provide\\npolynomial-time algorithms on $kP_3$-free graphs for every fixed integers $r$,\\n$k$, and $d \\\\geq 6$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,cs.DM\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T09:15:53Z\"}"}
