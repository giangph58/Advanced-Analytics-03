We explore how language models adjust their\\nconfidence and responses when presented with evidence with varying levels of\\ninformativeness and reliability. To study these properties, we create a dataset\\nwith various types of evidence and analyze language models' responses and\\nconfidence using verbalized confidence, token probability, and sampling. We\\nobserved that language models do not consistently follow Bayesian epistemology:\\nlanguage models follow the Bayesian confirmation assumption well with true\\nevidence but fail to adhere to other Bayesian assumptions when encountering\\ndifferent evidence types. Also, we demonstrated that language models can\\nexhibit high confidence when given strong evidence, but this does not always\\nguarantee high accuracy. Our analysis also reveals that language models are\\nbiased toward golden evidence and show varying performance depending on the\\ndegree of irrelevance, helping explain why they deviate from Bayesian\\nassumptions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T09:28:42Z\"}"}
