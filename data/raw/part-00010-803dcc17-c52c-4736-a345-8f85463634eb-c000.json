{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01802v1\", \"title\": \"Distributed Triangle Detection is Hard in Few Rounds\", \"summary\": \"In the distributed triangle detection problem, we have an $n$-vertex network\\n$G=(V,E)$ with one player for each vertex of the graph who sees the edges\\nincident on the vertex. The players communicate in synchronous rounds using the\\nedges of this network and have a limited bandwidth of $O(\\\\log{n})$ bits over\\neach edge. The goal is to detect whether or not $G$ contains a triangle as a\\nsubgraph in a minimal number of rounds.\\n  We prove that any protocol (deterministic or randomized) for distributed\\ntriangle detection requires $\\\\Omega(\\\\log\\\\log{n})$ rounds of communication.\\nPrior to our work, only one-round lower bounds were known for this problem.\\n  The primary technique for proving these types of distributed lower bounds is\\nvia reductions from two-party communication complexity. However, it has been\\nknown for a while that this approach is provably incapable of establishing any\\nmeaningful lower bounds for distributed triangle detection. Our main technical\\ncontribution is a new information theoretic argument which combines recent\\nadvances on multi-pass graph streaming lower bounds with the point-to-point\\ncommunication aspects of distributed models, and can be of independent\\ninterest.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS,cs.CC,cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:10:21Z\"}"}
