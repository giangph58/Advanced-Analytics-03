{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19784v1\", \"title\": \"Grain boundary complexion transitions in olivine with temperature\", \"summary\": \"Olivine comprises approximately 70 $\\\\%$ by volume of the Earth's upper\\nmantle, making it likely that it controls the mechanical, electrical and\\nseismic properties of the upper mantle. All rocks are composed of crystals\\nseparated by grain boundaries, which affect their overall conductivity,\\nstrength and viscosity. Here, we present a study of forsterite\\n(Mg$_{2}$SiO$_{4}$) polycrystals synthesised between 1150 $^{\\\\circ}$C and 1390\\n$^{\\\\circ}$C to obtain samples with different grain sizes. The grain boundary\\nplane distributions (GBPD) were analysed by SEM and EBSD. A reversible change\\nin the GBPD is observed between 1290 $^{\\\\circ}$C and 1390 $^{\\\\circ}$C. The GBPD\\nshows that the most commonly occurring grain boundary planes are {0kl}-type at\\n1290 $^{\\\\circ}$C and below, while at 1390 $^{\\\\circ}$C, (010) grain boundary\\nplanes dominate the average crystal habitus. The least common planes at all\\ntemperatures are (100). This reversible transition in the dominant grain\\nboundary plane type is evidence for a temperature-dependent complexion\\ntransition occurring between 1290 $^{\\\\circ}$C and 1390 $^{\\\\circ}$C. It is well\\nestablished that different grain boundary crystallographies are related to\\ndifferent grain boundary properties. We relate the observed grain boundary\\ncomplexion transition to differences in grain boundary properties observed in\\nprevious studies and suggest their influence on bulk rock properties.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.geo-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.geo-ph,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T13:28:20Z\"}"}
