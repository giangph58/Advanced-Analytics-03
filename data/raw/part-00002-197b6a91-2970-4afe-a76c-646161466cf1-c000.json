For K\\\\\\\"ahler manifolds\\nwhose first Chern class is not nef, the SYZ construction is further complicated\\nby the presence of additional holomorphic discs with non-positive Maslov index.\\n  In this paper, we study SYZ mirror symmetry for two of the simplest toric\\nexamples: the non-Fano Hirzebruch surfaces F_3 and F_4. For F_3, we determine\\nthe SYZ mirror associated to generic perturbations of the complex structure,\\nand demonstrate that the SYZ mirror depends on the choice of perturbation. For\\nF_4, we determine the SYZ mirror for a specific perturbation of complex\\nstructure, where the mirror superpotential is an explicit infinite Laurent\\nseries. Finally, we relate this superpotential to those arising from other\\nperturbations of F_4 via a scattering diagram.\", \"main_category\": \"math.SG\", \"categories\": \"math.SG,math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T16:49:05Z\"}"}
