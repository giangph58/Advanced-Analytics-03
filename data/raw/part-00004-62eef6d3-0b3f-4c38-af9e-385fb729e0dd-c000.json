{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11007v1\", \"title\": \"Kubernetes in the Cloud vs. Bare Metal: A Comparative Study of Network\\n  Costs\", \"summary\": \"Modern cloud-native applications increasingly utilise managed cloud services\\nand containerisation technologies, such as Kubernetes, to achieve rapid\\ntime-to-market and scalable deployments. Organisations must consider various\\nfactors, including cost implications when deciding on a hosting platform for\\ncontainerised applications as the usage grows. An emerging discipline called\\nFinOps combines financial management and cloud operations to optimise costs in\\ncloud-based applications. While prior research has explored system-level\\noptimisation strategies for cost and resource efficiency in containerized\\nsystems, analysing network costs in Kubernetes clusters remains underexplored.\\nThis paper investigates the network usage and cost implications of\\ncontainerised applications running on Kubernetes clusters. Using a methodology\\nthat combines measurement analysis, experimentation, and cost modelling, we aim\\nto provide organisations with actionable insights into network cost\\noptimisation. Our findings highlight key considerations for analysing network\\nexpenditures and evaluating the potential cost benefits of deploying\\napplications on cloud providers. Overall, this paper contributes to the\\nemerging FinOps discipline by addressing the financial and operational aspects\\nof managing network costs in cloud-native environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T09:26:08Z\"}"}
