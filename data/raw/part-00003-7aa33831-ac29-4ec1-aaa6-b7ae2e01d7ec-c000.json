{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17742v1\", \"title\": \"Novel Heusler Materials for Spintronic Applications: Growth,\\n  Characterizations and Applications\", \"summary\": \"Spintronics is a rapidly evolving technology that utilizes the spin of\\nelectrons along with their charge to enable high speed, low power and non\\nvolatile electronic devices. The development of novel materials with tailored\\nmagnetic and electronic properties is critical to exploit the full potential of\\nspintronic applications. Among these, Heusler alloys stand out due to their\\ntunable multifunctional properties. This review presents a comprehensive\\noverview of various Heusler based materials including half metallic\\nferromagnets, spin gapless semiconductors, magnetic semiconductors, spin\\nsemimetals, and nearly zero moment materials focusing on their synthesis,\\nstructural and magnetic characterizations, and transport behavior. The role of\\ncrystal structure, and structural disorder in governing their magnetic and\\nelectronic properties is discussed in detail. Emphasis is placed on\\nexperimental results and their implications for spintronic devices. By bringing\\ntogether recent advancements, the review highlights the critical role of\\nHeusler alloys in advancing the next-generation spintronic technologies and\\noutlines future directions for their integration in practical applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T16:57:53Z\"}"}
