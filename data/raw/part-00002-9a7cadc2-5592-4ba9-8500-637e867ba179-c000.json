In this work, we\\nintroduce novel loss functions to mitigate the impact of transcription errors\\nin RNN-Transducer models. Our Star-Transducer loss addresses deletion errors by\\nincorporating \\\"skip frame\\\" transitions in the loss lattice, restoring over 90%\\nof the system's performance compared to models trained with accurate\\ntranscripts. The Bypass-Transducer loss uses \\\"skip token\\\" transitions to tackle\\ninsertion errors, recovering more than 60% of the quality. Finally, the\\nTarget-Robust Transducer loss merges these approaches, offering robust\\nperformance against arbitrary errors. Experimental results demonstrate that the\\nTarget-Robust Transducer loss significantly improves RNN-T performance on noisy\\ndata by restoring over 70% of the quality compared to well-transcribed data.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.AS\", \"categories\": \"eess.AS,cs.AI,cs.CL,cs.LG,cs.SD\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T15:18:29Z\"}"}
