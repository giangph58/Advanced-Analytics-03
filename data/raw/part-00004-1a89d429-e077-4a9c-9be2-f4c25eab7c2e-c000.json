This condition is replaced by a contraction condition on\\nthe stage cost. But unlike the contraction based existing formulations where\\nthe prediction horizon becomes a decision variable, the formulation proposed in\\nthis paper remains standard in that it uses constant and short prediction\\nhorizon. An illustrative example is provided to assess the relevance of the\\nproposed formulation.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T08:46:23Z\"}"}
