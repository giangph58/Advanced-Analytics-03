{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12669v1\", \"title\": \"A novel fast sweeping method for computing the attenuation operator\\n  $t^*$ in absorbing media\", \"summary\": \"$t^*$ represents the total path attenuation and characterizes the amplitude\\ndecay of a propagating seismic wave. Calculating the attenuation operator $t^*$\\nis typically required in seismic attenuation tomography. Traditional methods\\nfor calculating $t^*$ require determining the ray path explicitly. However, ray\\ntracing can be computationally intensive when processing large datasets, and\\nconventional ray tracing techniques may fail even in mildly heterogeneous\\nmedia. In this study, we propose a modified fast sweeping method (MFSM) to\\nsolve the governing equation for $t^*$ without explicitly calculating the ray\\npath. The approach consists of two main steps. First, the traveltime field is\\ncalculated by numerically solving the eikonal equation using the fast sweeping\\nmethod. Second, $t^*$ is computed by solving its governing equation with the\\nMFSM, based on the discretization of the gradient of $t^*$ using an upwinding\\nscheme derived from the traveltime gradient. The MFSM is rigorously validated\\nthrough comparisons with analytical solutions and by examining $t^*$ errors\\nunder grid refinement in both simple and complex models. Key performance\\nmetrics, including convergence, number of iterations, and computation time, are\\nevaluated. Two versions of the MFSM are developed for both Cartesian and\\nspherical coordinate systems. We demonstrate the practical applicability of the\\ndeveloped MFSM in calculating $t^*$ in North Island, and discuss the method's\\nefficiency in estimating earthquake response spectra.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.geo-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.geo-ph,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T05:54:55Z\"}"}
