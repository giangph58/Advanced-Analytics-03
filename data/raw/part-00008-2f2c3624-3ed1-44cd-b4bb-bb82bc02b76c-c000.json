{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21259v1\", \"title\": \"LSTM+Geo with xgBoost Filtering: A Novel Approach for Race and Ethnicity\\n  Imputation with Reduced Bias\", \"summary\": \"Accurate imputation of race and ethnicity (R&E) is crucial for analyzing\\ndisparities and informing policy. Methods like Bayesian Improved Surname\\nGeocoding (BISG) are widely used but exhibit limitations, including systematic\\nmisclassification biases linked to socioeconomic status. This paper introduces\\nLSTM+Geo, a novel approach enhancing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks\\nwith census tract geolocation information. Using a large voter dataset, we\\ndemonstrate that LSTM+Geo (88.7% accuracy) significantly outperforms standalone\\nLSTM (86.4%) and Bayesian methods like BISG (82.9%) and BIFSG (86.8%) in\\naccuracy and F1-score on a held-out validation set. LSTM+Geo reduces the rate\\nat which non-White individuals are misclassified as White (White FPR 19.3%)\\ncompared to name-only LSTMs (White FPR 24.6%). While sophisticated ensemble\\nmethods incorporating XGBoost achieve the highest overall accuracy (up to\\n89.4%) and lowest White FPR (17.8%), LSTM+Geo offers strong standalone\\nperformance with improved bias characteristics compared to baseline models.\\nIntegrating LSTM+Geo into an XGBoost ensemble further boosts accuracy,\\nhighlighting its utility as both a standalone model and a component for\\nadvanced systems. We give a caution at the end regarding the appropriate use of\\nthese methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T02:20:08Z\"}"}
