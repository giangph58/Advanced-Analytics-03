We\\nassume that, conditionally on the environment $\\\\omega$, all the random walks\\nare independent and start from even initial locations. Our assumption on the\\nlaw of the environment is such that a single random walk in the environment\\n$\\\\omega$ is transient to the right but subballistic, with parameter\\n$0<\\\\kappa<1/2$. We show that - for every value of $d$ - there are almost surely\\ninfinitely many times for which all these random walks,\\n$(Z_n)_{n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}}$ and $\\\\big(S_n^{(j)}\\\\big)_{n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}}$, $1\\\\leq j\\n\\\\leq d$, are simultaneously at the same location, even though one of them is\\nrecurrent and the $d$ others ones are transient.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T16:05:11Z\"}"}
