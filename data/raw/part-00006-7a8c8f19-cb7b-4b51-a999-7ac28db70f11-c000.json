{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12895v1\", \"title\": \"Optimum Contribution Selection for Honeybees\", \"summary\": \"In 1997, T. H. E. Meuwissen published a groundbreaking article titled\\n'Maximizing the response of selection with a predefined rate of inbreeding', in\\nwhich he provided an optimized solution for the trade-off between genetic\\nresponse and inbreeding avoidance in animal breeding. Evidently, this issue is\\nhighly relevant for the honeybee with its small breeding population sizes.\\nHowever, the genetic peculiarities of bees have thus far prevented an\\napplication of the theory to this species. The present manuscript intends to\\nfill this desideratum. It develops the necessary bee-specific theory and\\nintroduces a small R script that implements Optimum Contribution Selection\\n(OCS) for honeybees. While researching for this manuscript, we found it rather\\ncumbersome that even though Meuwissen's theory is 28 years old and has sparked\\nresearch in many new directions, to our knowledge, there is still no\\ncomprehensive textbook on the topic. Instead, all relevant information had to\\nbe extracted from several articles, leading to a steep learning curve. We\\nanticipate that many honeybee breeding scientists with a putative interest in\\nOCS for honeybees have little to no experience with classical OCS. Thus, we\\ndecided to embed our new derivations into a general introduction to OCS that\\nthen specializes more and more to the honeybee case. The result are these 121\\npages, of which we hope that at least the first sections can also be of use for\\nbreeding theorists concerned with other species than honeybees.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.PE\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.PE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T12:37:58Z\"}"}
