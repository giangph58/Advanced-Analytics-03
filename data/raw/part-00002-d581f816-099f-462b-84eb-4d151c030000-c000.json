{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11344v1\", \"title\": \"Interpretable Hybrid-Rule Temporal Point Processes\", \"summary\": \"Temporal Point Processes (TPPs) are widely used for modeling event sequences\\nin various medical domains, such as disease onset prediction, progression\\nanalysis, and clinical decision support. Although TPPs effectively capture\\ntemporal dynamics, their lack of interpretability remains a critical challenge.\\nRecent advancements have introduced interpretable TPPs. However, these methods\\nfail to incorporate numerical features, thereby limiting their ability to\\ngenerate precise predictions. To address this issue, we propose Hybrid-Rule\\nTemporal Point Processes (HRTPP), a novel framework that integrates temporal\\nlogic rules with numerical features, improving both interpretability and\\npredictive accuracy in event modeling. HRTPP comprises three key components:\\nbasic intensity for intrinsic event likelihood, rule-based intensity for\\nstructured temporal dependencies, and numerical feature intensity for dynamic\\nprobability modulation. To effectively discover valid rules, we introduce a\\ntwo-phase rule mining strategy with Bayesian optimization. To evaluate our\\nmethod, we establish a multi-criteria assessment framework, incorporating rule\\nvalidity, model fitting, and temporal predictive accuracy. Experimental results\\non real-world medical datasets demonstrate that HRTPP outperforms\\nstate-of-the-art interpretable TPPs in terms of predictive performance and\\nclinical interpretability. In case studies, the rules extracted by HRTPP\\nexplain the disease progression, offering valuable contributions to medical\\ndiagnosis.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:15:16Z\"}"}
