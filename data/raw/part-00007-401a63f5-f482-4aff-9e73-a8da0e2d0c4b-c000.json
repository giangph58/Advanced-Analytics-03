{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19734v1\", \"title\": \"LLM-Assisted Automated Deductive Coding of Dialogue Data: Leveraging\\n  Dialogue-Specific Characteristics to Enhance Contextual Understanding\", \"summary\": \"Dialogue data has been a key source for understanding learning processes,\\noffering critical insights into how students engage in collaborative\\ndiscussions and how these interactions shape their knowledge construction. The\\nadvent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced promising opportunities\\nfor advancing qualitative research, particularly in the automated coding of\\ndialogue data. However, the inherent contextual complexity of dialogue presents\\nunique challenges for these models, especially in understanding and\\ninterpreting complex contextual information. This study addresses these\\nchallenges by developing a novel LLM-assisted automated coding approach for\\ndialogue data. The novelty of our proposed framework is threefold: 1) We\\npredict the code for an utterance based on dialogue-specific characteristics --\\ncommunicative acts and communicative events -- using separate prompts following\\nthe role prompts and chain-of-thoughts methods; 2) We engaged multiple LLMs\\nincluding GPT-4-turbo, GPT-4o, DeepSeek in collaborative code prediction; 3) We\\nleveraged the interrelation between events and acts to implement consistency\\nchecking using GPT-4o. In particular, our contextual consistency checking\\nprovided a substantial accuracy improvement. We also found the accuracy of act\\npredictions was consistently higher than that of event predictions. This study\\ncontributes a new methodological framework for enhancing the precision of\\nautomated coding of dialogue data as well as offers a scalable solution for\\naddressing the contextual challenges inherent in dialogue analysis.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T12:31:38Z\"}"}
