{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10419v1\", \"title\": \"Unchecked and Overlooked: Addressing the Checkbox Blind Spot in Large\\n  Language Models with CheckboxQA\", \"summary\": \"Checkboxes are critical in real-world document processing where the presence\\nor absence of ticks directly informs data extraction and decision-making\\nprocesses. Yet, despite the strong performance of Large Vision and Language\\nModels across a wide range of tasks, they struggle with interpreting checkable\\ncontent. This challenge becomes particularly pressing in industries where a\\nsingle overlooked checkbox may lead to costly regulatory or contractual\\noversights. To address this gap, we introduce the CheckboxQA dataset, a\\ntargeted resource designed to evaluate and improve model performance on\\ncheckbox-related tasks. It reveals the limitations of current models and serves\\nas a valuable tool for advancing document comprehension systems, with\\nsignificant implications for applications in sectors such as legal tech and\\nfinance.\\n  The dataset is publicly available at:\\nhttps://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/CheckboxQA\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:06:59Z\"}"}
