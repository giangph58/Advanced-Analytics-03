{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20677v1\", \"title\": \"Occlusion-aware Driver Monitoring System using the Driver Monitoring\\n  Dataset\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents a robust, occlusion-aware driver monitoring system (DMS)\\nutilizing the Driver Monitoring Dataset (DMD). The system performs driver\\nidentification, gaze estimation by regions, and face occlusion detection under\\nvarying lighting conditions, including challenging low-light scenarios. Aligned\\nwith EuroNCAP recommendations, the inclusion of occlusion detection enhances\\nsituational awareness and system trustworthiness by indicating when the\\nsystem's performance may be degraded. The system employs separate algorithms\\ntrained on RGB and infrared (IR) images to ensure reliable functioning. We\\ndetail the development and integration of these algorithms into a cohesive\\npipeline, addressing the challenges of working with different sensors and\\nreal-car implementation. Evaluation on the DMD and in real-world scenarios\\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed system, highlighting the\\nsuperior performance of RGB-based models and the pioneering contribution of\\nrobust occlusion detection in DMS.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T11:58:37Z\"}"}
