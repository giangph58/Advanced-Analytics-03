Under certain mild conditions on that\\nmeasure, it is shown that it is an integral operator similar to the\\nVladimirov-Taibleson operator on the p-adic integers. Its spectral properties\\nare studied, and the Markov property and kernel representation of the heat\\nkernel generated by this so-called \\\\emph{Vladimirov-Pearson} operator is shown,\\nviewed as acting on a certain Sobolev space. A large class of these operators\\nhave a heat kernel and a Green function explicitly given by the ultrametric\\nwavelets on the Cantor set, which are eigenfunctions of the operator.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:33:59Z\"}"}
