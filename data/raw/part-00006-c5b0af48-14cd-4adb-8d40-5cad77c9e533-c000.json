The associated universal R-matrix is also obtained via an\\nadmissible Drinfel'd twist, making the algebra a quasi-triangular Hopf algebra.\\nThe fundamental representation of the universal R-matrix yields the familiar\\nset-theoretic (combinatorial) solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. We then\\napply the same Drinfel'd twist to the gl_n Yangian after introducing the\\naugmented Yangian. We show that the augmented Yangian is also a Hopf algebra\\nand we obtain the twisted version of the augmented gl_n Yangian as well as the\\ntwisted R-matrix.\", \"main_category\": \"math.QA\", \"categories\": \"math.QA,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:25:33Z\"}"}
