We propose a general approach for measuring the topological\\ninvariants of one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems, which can be derived from\\nthe spin textures of right eigenstates. By utilizing a dilation method, we\\nrealize a non-Hermitian system without chiral symmetry on a two-qubit nuclear\\nmagnetic resonance system and measure the winding number associated with the\\neigenstates. In addition to examining the topology of the eigenstates, our\\nexperiment also reveals the topological structure of the energy band, which\\ndiffers from that in chiral systems. Our work paves the way for further\\nexploration of complex topological properties in non-Hermitian systems without\\nchiral symmetry.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T06:21:24Z\"}"}
