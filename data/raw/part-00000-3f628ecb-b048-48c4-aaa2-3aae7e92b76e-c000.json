{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15872v1\", \"title\": \"Multiscale detection of practically significant changes in a gradually\\n  varying time series\", \"summary\": \"In many change point problems it is reasonable to assume that compared to a\\nbenchmark at a given time point $t_0$ the properties of the observed stochastic\\nprocess change gradually over time for $t >t_0$. Often, these gradual changes\\nare not of interest as long as they are small (nonrelevant), but one is\\ninterested in the question if the deviations are practically significant in the\\nsense that the deviation of the process compared to the time $t_0$ (measured by\\nan appropriate metric) exceeds a given threshold, which is of practical\\nsignificance (relevant change).\\n  In this paper we develop novel and powerful change point analysis for\\ndetecting such deviations in a sequence of gradually varying means, which is\\ncompared with the average mean from a previous time period. Current approaches\\nto this problem suffer from low power, rely on the selection of smoothing\\nparameters and require a rather regular (smooth) development for the means. We\\ndevelop a multiscale procedure that alleviates all these issues, validate it\\ntheoretically and demonstrate its good finite sample performance on both\\nsynthetic and real data.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T13:16:44Z\"}"}
