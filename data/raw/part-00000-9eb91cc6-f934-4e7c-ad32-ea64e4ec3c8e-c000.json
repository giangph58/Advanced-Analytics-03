{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24021v1\", \"title\": \"IntelliCircos: A Data-driven and AI-powered Authoring Tool for Circos\\n  Plots\", \"summary\": \"Genomics data is essential in biological and medical domains, and\\nbioinformatics analysts often manually create circos plots to analyze the data\\nand extract valuable insights. However, creating circos plots is complex, as it\\nrequires careful design for multiple track attributes and positional\\nrelationships between them. Typically, analysts often seek inspiration from\\nexisting circos plots, and they have to iteratively adjust and refine the plot\\nto achieve a satisfactory final design, making the process both tedious and\\ntime-intensive. To address these challenges, we propose IntelliCircos, an\\nAI-powered interactive authoring tool that streamlines the process from initial\\nvisual design to the final implementation of circos plots. Specifically, we\\nbuild a new dataset containing 4396 circos plots with corresponding annotations\\nand configurations, which are extracted and labeled from published papers. With\\nthe dataset, we further identify track combination patterns, and utilize Large\\nLanguage Model (LLM) to provide domain-specific design recommendations and\\nconfiguration references to navigate the design of circos plots. We conduct a\\nuser study with 8 bioinformatics analysts to evaluate IntelliCircos, and the\\nresults demonstrate its usability and effectiveness in authoring circos plots.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T12:48:39Z\"}"}
