While the implications and applications of\\nstochastic resetting for a single particle are well understood, less is known\\nabout resetting of many interacting particles. In this study, we experimentally\\nand numerically investigate a system of six colloidal particles undergoing two\\ntypes of stochastic resetting protocols: global resetting, where all particles\\nare returned to their origin simultaneously, and local resetting, where\\nparticles are reset one at a time. Our particles interact mainly through\\nhard-core repulsion and hydrodynamic flows. We find that the most substantial\\neffect of interparticle interactions is observed for local resetting,\\nspecifically when particles are physically dragged to the origin. In this case,\\nhard-core repulsion broadens the steady-state distribution, while hydrodynamic\\ninteractions significantly narrow the distribution. The combination results in\\na steady-state distribution that is wider compared to that of a single particle\\nsystem both for global and local resetting protocols.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:18:37Z\"}"}
