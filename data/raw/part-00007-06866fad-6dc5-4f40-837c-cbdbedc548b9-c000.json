We establish quantitative\\nfluctuation estimates for the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the combinatorial\\nLaplacian on subsets of $\\\\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ when their cardinality diverges. Our\\napproach is based on a controlled discrete-to-continuum extension of the\\nassociated variational problem and the quantitative Faber-Krahn inequality.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T13:32:00Z\"}"}
