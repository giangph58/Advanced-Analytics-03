Furthermore, the spacetimes become totally vicious when $|a|>M$,\\nmeaning that through every point there exists a closed timelike curve. Despite\\nthis, we prove that the Kerr spacetimes do not admit any closed null geodesics\\nwhen $|a|\\\\geq M$. This result generalises recent findings by one of the\\nauthors, which showed the nonexistence of closed causal geodesics in the case\\n$|a|<M$. Combining these results, we establish the absence of closed null\\ngeodesics in Kerr spacetimes for any non-zero $a$.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T17:26:42Z\"}"}
