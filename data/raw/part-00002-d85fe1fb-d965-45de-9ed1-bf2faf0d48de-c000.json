{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07881v1\", \"title\": \"An LLM-Driven Multi-Agent Debate System for Mendelian Diseases\", \"summary\": \"Accurate diagnosis of Mendelian diseases is crucial for precision therapy and\\nassistance in preimplantation genetic diagnosis. However, existing methods\\noften fall short of clinical standards or depend on extensive datasets to build\\npretrained machine learning models. To address this, we introduce an innovative\\nLLM-Driven multi-agent debate system (MD2GPS) with natural language\\nexplanations of the diagnostic results. It utilizes a language model to\\ntransform results from data-driven and knowledge-driven agents into natural\\nlanguage, then fostering a debate between these two specialized agents. This\\nsystem has been tested on 1,185 samples across four independent datasets,\\nenhancing the TOP1 accuracy from 42.9% to 66% on average. Additionally, in a\\nchallenging cohort of 72 cases, MD2GPS identified potential pathogenic genes in\\n12 patients, reducing the diagnostic time by 90%. The methods within each\\nmodule of this multi-agent debate system are also replaceable, facilitating its\\nadaptation for diagnosing and researching other complex diseases.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.GN\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.GN\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:55:34Z\"}"}
