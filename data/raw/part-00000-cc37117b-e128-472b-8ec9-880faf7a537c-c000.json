For the droplet\\ngeometry, we find a relatively simpler formula for the multi-time law compared\\nto a previous formula of Johansson and the author. For the stationary geometry,\\nwe find the two-time law, which extends the single time law due to Baik-Rains\\nand Ferrari-Spohn. These formulas are derived as the scaling limit of\\ncorresponding multi-time formulas for geometric last passage percolation.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:48:18Z\"}"}
