Previous\\nmonitoring campaigns of PG 2130+099 disagree as to whether the continuum\\nemitting region size is consistent with that predicted for a standard optically\\nthick geometrically thin accretion disk. We present $\\\\sim$6 months of\\nobservations from several robotic telescopes, providing the highest cadence and\\nwidest wavelength coverage photometric RM study of PG 2130+099 to date. Our\\nresults indicate that inferred size of the continuum-emitting region in PG\\n2130+099, like many recently observed AGN, is larger than the simplest\\npredictions for an irradiated geometrically thin, optically thick accretion\\ndisk. We also perform a flux-flux analysis, finding a variable spectrum broadly\\nconsistent with a disk, and a constant component with enhanced\\n$\\\\textit{i}$-band emission, potentially due to H$\\\\alpha$. We find some evidence\\nof increasing lag with luminosity, but previous lag measurements are too\\nuncertain to be definitive.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T16:10:36Z\"}"}
