The first identifies a 1151-year planetary cycle based on\\nthe recurrence of visible configurations of Mercury to Saturn, including the\\nSun and Moon, from a geocentric perspective. The second, called SESCC\\n(Speed-Error Signals Cross Correlation), statistically estimates the epoch of\\nstar catalogs by analyzing the correlation between positional error and proper\\nmotion in ecliptic latitude. Both methods are reproducible, data-driven, and\\nyield results that contradict key tenets of the New Chronology proposed by\\nFomenko and Nosovsky, most notably the claim that the Anno Domini began in 1152\\nCE. Open-source code and analysis tools are provided for independent\\nverification.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.IM,physics.hist-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T14:11:00Z\"}"}
