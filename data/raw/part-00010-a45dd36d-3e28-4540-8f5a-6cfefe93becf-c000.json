Specifically, we analyze a realistic model of an armchair\\nhexagonal geometry comprising $42$ lattice sites, nanopatterned on GaAs quantum\\nwells with nearest-neighbor distance of $a = 50$ nm. Our results reveal a\\ndistinct magnetic phase transition near $U/t \\\\approx 60$ driven by the\\nabsence/addition of a single electron at half-filling where the ferromagnetic\\nphase is further stabilized by Coulomb scattering terms.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:46:41Z\"}"}
