To do this, we\\nintroduce a basis of functions\\n  inspired by a decomposition of the wavefunction into time-ordered components.\\nRepresenting these basis\\n  functions and their singularities by graph tubings, we show that a remarkably\\nsimple rule for the merger\\n  of tubes produces the differential equations for arbitrary tree graphs (and\\nloop integrands). We find that\\n  the basis functions can be assigned to the vertices, edges, and facets of\\nconvex geometries (in the simplest\\n  cases, collections of hypercubes) which capture the compatibility of mergers\\nand define how the basis\\n  functions are coupled in the differential equations. This organization of\\nfunctions also simplifies solving\\n  the differential equations. The merger of tubes is shown to reflect the\\ncausal properties of bulk physics,\\n  in particular the collapse of time-ordered propagators. Taken together, these\\nobservations demystify the\\n  origin of the kinematic flow observed in these equations [1].\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T06:38:04Z\"}"}
