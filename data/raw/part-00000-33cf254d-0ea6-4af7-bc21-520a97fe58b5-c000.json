To test the null hypothesis that\\n$\\\\mathcal P$ belongs to a given parametric family, we construct a convergent\\ncompensated counting process to which we apply an innovation martingale\\ntransformation. We prove that the resulting process converges weakly to a\\nstandard Wiener process. Consequently, taking a suitable functional of this\\nprocess yields an asymptotically distribution-free goodness-of-fit test for\\npoint processes. For several standard tests based on the increments of this\\ntransformed process, we establish consistency under alternative hypotheses.\\nFinally, we assess the performance of the proposed testing procedure through a\\nMonte Carlo simulation study and illustrate its practical utility with two\\nreal-data examples.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:15:52Z\"}"}
