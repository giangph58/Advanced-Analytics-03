{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12125v1\", \"title\": \"EmoACT: a Framework to Embed Emotions into Artificial Agents Based on\\n  Affect Control Theory\", \"summary\": \"As robots and artificial agents become increasingly integrated into daily\\nlife, enhancing their ability to interact with humans is essential. Emotions,\\nwhich play a crucial role in human interactions, can improve the naturalness\\nand transparency of human-robot interactions (HRI) when embodied in artificial\\nagents. This study aims to employ Affect Control Theory (ACT), a psychological\\nmodel of emotions deeply rooted in interaction, for the generation of synthetic\\nemotions. A platform-agnostic framework inspired by ACT was developed and\\nimplemented in a humanoid robot to assess its impact on human perception.\\nResults show that the frequency of emotional displays impacts how users\\nperceive the robot. Moreover, appropriate emotional expressions seem to enhance\\nthe robot's perceived emotional and cognitive agency. The findings suggest that\\nACT can be successfully employed to embed synthetic emotions into robots,\\nresulting in effective human-robot interactions, where the robot is perceived\\nmore as a social agent than merely a machine.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T14:36:52Z\"}"}
