{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21484v1\", \"title\": \"Chiral interactions between tropocollagen molecules determine the\\n  collagen microfibril structure\", \"summary\": \"Collagen is the most abundant structural protein in animals, forming\\nhierarchically organised fibrils that provide mechanical support to tissues.\\nDespite detailed structural studies, the physical principles that govern the\\nformation of the characteristic axially-periodic collagen microfibril remain\\npoorly understood. Here, we present a theoretical framework that links the\\namino acid sequence of tropocollagen to its supramolecular organisation. By\\ncombining statistical modeling of residue geometry with sequence-informed\\ninteraction potentials, we show that the chiral arrangement of outward-facing\\nresidues induces directional intermolecular interactions that drive molecular\\nsupercoiling. These interactions favour the formation of right-handed,\\npentameric microfibrils with a staggered axial periodicity of approximately 67\\nnm. Our simulations reveal that this structure emerges across a wide range of\\nmammalian collagen sequences as a global energy minimum robust to biochemical\\nnoise. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for collagen's\\nsupramolecular chirality and offer design principles for engineering synthetic\\ncollagen-mimetic materials.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,q-bio.BM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T10:08:16Z\"}"}
