{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07665v1\", \"title\": \"Chirality-induced selectivity of angular momentum by orbital Edelstein\\n  effect in carbon nanotubes\", \"summary\": \"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are promising materials exhibiting exceptional\\nstrength, electrical conductivity, and thermal properties, making them\\npromising for various technologies. Besides achiral configurations with a\\nzigzag or armchair edge, there exist chiral CNTs with a broken inversion\\nsymmetry. Here, we demonstrate that chiral CNTs exhibit chirality-induced\\norbital selectivity (CIOS), which is caused by the orbital Edelstein effect and\\ncould be detected as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). We find that\\nthe orbital Edelstein susceptibility is an odd function of the chirality angle\\nof the nanotube and is proportional to its radius. For metallic CNTs close to\\nthe Fermi level, the orbital Edelstein susceptibility increases quadratically\\nwith energy. This makes the CISS and CIOS of metallic chiral nanotubes\\nconveniently tunable by doping or applying a gate voltage, which allows for the\\ngeneration of spin- and orbital-polarized currents. The possibility of\\ngenerating large torques makes chiral CNTs interesting candidates for\\ntechnological applications in spin-orbitronics and quantum computing.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T11:39:13Z\"}"}
