{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12945v1\", \"title\": \"A resource theory of asynchronous quantum information processing\", \"summary\": \"In standard quantum teleportation, the receiver must wait for a classical\\nmessage from the sender before subsequently processing the transmitted quantum\\ninformation. However, in port-based teleportation (PBT), this local processing\\ncan begin before the classical message is received, thereby allowing for\\nasynchronous quantum information processing. Motivated by resource-theoretic\\nconsiderations and practical applications, we propose different communication\\nmodels that progressively allow for more powerful decoding strategies while\\nstill permitting asynchronous distributed quantum computation, a salient\\nfeature of standard PBT. Specifically, we consider PBT protocols augmented by\\nfree classical processing and/or different forms of quantum pre-processing, and\\nwe investigate the maximum achievable teleportation fidelities under such\\noperations. Our analysis focuses specifically on the PBT power of isotropic\\nstates, bipartite graph states, and symmetrized EPR states, and we compute\\ntight bounds on the optimal teleportation fidelities for such states. We\\nfinally show that, among this hierarchy of communication models consistent with\\nasynchronous quantum information processing, the strongest resource theory is\\nequally as powerful as any one-way teleportation protocol for surpassing the\\nclassical teleportation threshold. Thus, a bipartite state can break the\\none-way classical teleportation threshold if and only if it can be done using\\nthe trivial decoding map of discarding subsystems.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T13:46:02Z\"}"}
