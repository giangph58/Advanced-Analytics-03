The algorithm is a least squares algorithm that\\nsamples the function at the points of a generated set. We show that there exist\\n$\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\zeta} \\\\in [0,1]^d$ for which the worst-case $L_2$ error has the\\noptimal order of convergence if the space has polynomially converging\\napproximation numbers. In fact, this holds for a significant portion of the\\ngenerators. Additionally we show that a restriction to rational generators is\\npossible with a slight increase of the bound. Furthermore, we specialise the\\nresults to the weighted Korobov space, where we derive a bound applicable to\\nlow values of sample points, and state tractability results.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T10:33:19Z\"}"}
