{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17339v1\", \"title\": \"Bridging Optical Sensing and Wearable Health Monitoring: A\\n  Functionalized Plasmonic Nanopillar for Non-Invasive Sweat Glucose Detection\", \"summary\": \"Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is vital for diabetes care, but current\\nsystems rely on invasive implants or electrochemical sensors that often cause\\ndiscomfort and skin irritation. Non-invasive alternatives remain limited by low\\nsensitivity and poor compatibility with complex sweat environments,\\nhighlighting the urgent need for a comfortable and reliable solution. Here, we\\nreport the development of a wearable optical sensor watch that integrates\\nsurface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology with a functionalized silver-coated\\nsilicon nanowire (Ag/SiNW) substrate for real-time, non-invasive glucose\\nmonitoring in sweat. The nanostructured sensor is functionalized with\\n4-mercaptophenylboronic acid (4-MPBA), enabling selective glucose capture and\\noptical signal transduction through both Raman scattering and SPR shift. The\\ndual-mode detection strategy was systematically optimized, and a miniaturized\\nSPR system operating at 638 nm was successfully integrated into a wearable\\nwatch format with wireless data transmission to a mobile application. This\\nwearable device demonstrated excellent sensitivity (LOD down to 0.12 mM) and\\nhigh selectivity in detecting glucose within physiological sweat concentration\\nranges. Human subject trials confirmed its applicability in real-life\\nscenarios. This study offers a promising non-invasive alternative to\\ntraditional CGM and highlights the potential of integrating nanophotonic\\nsensors with wearable platforms for continuous health monitoring and\\npersonalized medicine.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T07:56:34Z\"}"}
