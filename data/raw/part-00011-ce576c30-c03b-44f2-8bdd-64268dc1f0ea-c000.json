The\\ncalculation is carried out using both the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) and\\nWeisskopf-Wigner approximation (WWA). It is shown that a consistent application\\nof the WWA leads to expressions for both the energy and angular momentum in the\\nfield that are finite for all times, in contrast to the results for a classical\\npoint dipole oscillator. Moreover, it is shown that the total angular momentum\\nin the field is a sum of its spin and orbital components, again in contrast to\\nthe analogous results for a classical point dipole oscillator. Analytic\\nexpressions for the energy, spin angular momentum, and orbital angular momentum\\nin the field are obtained for an atom undergoing spontaneous emission from a\\nstate having angular momentum H to a state having angular momentum G via an\\nelectric dipole transition. It is shown that the spin and orbital angular\\nmomenta in the field are equal, independent of the values of H and G. With a\\nslight modification of the WWA, it can also be shown that the energy density in\\nthe field, the Poynting vector of the field, and the angular momentum flux of\\nthe field do not diverge at the origin.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:52:42Z\"}"}
