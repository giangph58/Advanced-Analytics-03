{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19635v1\", \"title\": \"Diffusion Stochastic Learning Over Adaptive Competing Networks\", \"summary\": \"This paper studies a stochastic dynamic game between two competing teams,\\neach consisting of a network of collaborating agents. Unlike fully cooperative\\nsettings, where all agents share a common objective, each team in this game\\naims to minimize its own distinct objective. In the adversarial setting, their\\nobjectives could be conflicting as in zero-sum games. Throughout the\\ncompetition, agents share strategic information within their own team while\\nsimultaneously inferring and adapting to the strategies of the opposing team.\\nWe propose diffusion learning algorithms to address two important classes of\\nthis network game: i) a zero-sum game characterized by weak cross-team subgraph\\ninteractions, and ii) a general non-zero-sum game exhibiting strong cross-team\\nsubgraph interactions. We analyze the stability performance of the proposed\\nalgorithms under reasonable assumptions and illustrate the theoretical results\\nthrough experiments on Cournot team competition and decentralized GAN training.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MA\", \"categories\": \"cs.MA,cs.LG,math.OC,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T09:49:54Z\"}"}
