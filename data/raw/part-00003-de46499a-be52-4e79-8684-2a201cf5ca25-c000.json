The detectors integrate three key features: (1)\\nnewly designed monolithic Germanium sensors optimised to mitigate\\ncharge-sharing events, (2) an improved cooling and mechanical design structure\\nsupported by thermal simulations, and (3) complete electronic chain featuring a\\nlow-noise CMOS technology-based preamplifier. enabling high X-ray count rate\\ncapability over a broad energy range (5-100 keV). This paper discusses the\\nfirst integration and characterization of one of the two multi-element Ge\\ndetectors at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). The\\nintegration phase included validating high-throughput front-End electronics,\\nintegrating them with the Ge sensor, and operating them at liquid nitrogen\\ntemperature, in addition to the experimental characterization, which consists\\nof electronics noise study and spectroscopic performance evaluation.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T07:51:37Z\"}"}
