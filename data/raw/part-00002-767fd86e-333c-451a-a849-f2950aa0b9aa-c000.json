{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15791v1\", \"title\": \"Crisp complexity of fuzzy classifiers\", \"summary\": \"Rule-based systems are a very popular form of explainable AI, particularly in\\nthe fuzzy community, where fuzzy rules are widely used for control and\\nclassification problems. However, fuzzy rule-based classifiers struggle to\\nreach bigger traction outside of fuzzy venues, because users sometimes do not\\nknow about fuzzy and because fuzzy partitions are not so easy to interpret in\\nsome situations. In this work, we propose a methodology to reduce fuzzy\\nrule-based classifiers to crisp rule-based classifiers. We study different\\npossible crisp descriptions and implement an algorithm to obtain them. Also, we\\nanalyze the complexity of the resulting crisp classifiers. We believe that our\\nresults can help both fuzzy and non-fuzzy practitioners understand better the\\nway in which fuzzy rule bases partition the feature space and how easily one\\nsystem can be translated to another and vice versa. Our complexity metric can\\nalso help to choose between different fuzzy classifiers based on what the\\nequivalent crisp partitions look like.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T11:06:25Z\"}"}
