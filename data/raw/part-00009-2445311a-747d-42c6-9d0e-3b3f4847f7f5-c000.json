The weak phase\\ncomes from the CKM matrix and a strong phase may result from the resonance\\neffect which is produced by the mixing of vector meson\\n$V\\\\left\\\\{\\\\rho^{0}(770),\\\\omega(782),\\\\phi(1020)\\\\right\\\\}$ to $\\\\pi^+ \\\\pi^-$ meson\\npairs. $\\\\rho^{0}(770)$ can decay directly into $\\\\pi^+ \\\\pi^-$ meson pairs, both\\n$\\\\omega(782)$ and $\\\\phi(1020)$ can also decay into $\\\\pi^+ \\\\pi^-$ meson pairs\\nwith small contribution from isospin symmetry breaking. The main contribution\\nfor the middle state vector meson $\\\\rho^{0}(770)-\\\\omega(782)-\\\\phi(1020)$\\ninterference is the mix of $\\\\rho^{0}(770)$, $\\\\omega(782)-\\\\rho^{0}(770)$ and\\n$\\\\phi(1020)-\\\\rho^{0}(770)$. We calculate the CP asymmetry and decay branching\\nratio for $\\\\bar{B}^0_{s} \\\\rightarrow \\\\pi^+ \\\\pi^- \\\\pi^0 (\\\\bar K ^{0})$ in the\\nframework of QCD factorization and compare them with previous work. We also add\\nthe analysis of $\\\\bar{B}^0_{s} \\\\rightarrow \\\\pi^+ \\\\pi^- \\\\eta(\\\\eta^{(')})$ decay\\nprocess. The results show that the CP asymmetry of these four decay processes\\nare significantly enhanced especially for the $\\\\bar{B}^0_{s} \\\\rightarrow \\\\pi^+\\n\\\\pi^- \\\\bar K ^{0}$ decay process and the decay branching ratio also changes\\nunder resonance effect. These work might provide support for the experimental\\nanalysis of the $\\\\bar B^{0}_s$ meson.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T07:25:06Z\"}"}
