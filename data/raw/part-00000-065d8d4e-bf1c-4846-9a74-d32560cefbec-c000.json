In this manuscript, we find a closed\\nformula for the Gaussian ergotropy, i.e. the maximum energy that can be\\nextracted from bosonic systems governed by quadratic Hamiltonians by means of\\nGaussian unitaries only. This formula resembles the well-known eigenvalue-based\\nexpression for the standard ergotropy, but is instead formulated using\\nsymplectic eigenvalues. We further prove that the Gaussian ergotropy is\\nadditive, indicating that the multiple-copy scenario does not benefit from\\nGaussian entangling operations. Extending our analysis to the relationship\\nbetween ergotropic and entropic functions, we establish bounds linking entropic\\nmeasures of Gaussianity to extractable work. Finally, we generalise our\\nframework to open systems by studying the optimal state preparation that\\nminimises the energy output in a Gaussian channel.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:56:00Z\"}"}
