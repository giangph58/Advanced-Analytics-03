{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05424v1\", \"title\": \"An efficient second-order cone programming approach for dynamic optimal\\n  transport on staggered grid discretization\", \"summary\": \"This paper proposes an efficient numerical method based on second-order cone\\nprogramming (SOCP) to solve dynamic optimal transport (DOT) problems with\\nquadratic cost on staggered grid discretization. By properly reformulating\\ndiscretized DOT problems into a linear SOCP, the proposed method eliminates the\\ninterpolation matrices and thus avoids solving a series of cubic equations and\\nlinear systems induced by interpolation. Then, by taking advantage of the SOCP\\nreformulation, we can solve them efficiently by a computationally highly\\neconomical implementation of an inexact decomposition-based proximal augmented\\nLagrangian method. Moreover, we have made the proposed approach an open-source\\nsoftware package. Numerical experiments on various DOT problems suggest that\\nthe proposed approach performs significantly more efficiently than\\nstate-of-the-art software packages. In addition, it exhibits prominent\\nrobustness to problems with non-negative measures.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T17:13:41Z\"}"}
