Notwithstanding the established\\nconsensus that the field-polarized phase in the honeycomb-lattice Kitaev magnet\\nhosts topological magnons exhibiting Chern numbers $C = \\\\pm1$, the nature of\\nmagnon excitations in Kitaev magnets on the star lattice, a triangle-decorated\\nhoneycomb lattice, has rarely been explored primarily due to its complicated\\ngeometry. To this end, we study the band topology of magnons on the star\\nlattice in the presence of a strong out-of-plane magnetic field using linear\\nspin-wave theory. By calculating the Chern numbers of magnon bands, we find\\nthat topological phase diagrams are predominantly composed of two distinct\\ntopological phases whose Chern numbers are different by a sign in inverse\\norder. Remarkably, each phase is characterized by a high Chern number of either\\n$+2$ or $-2$. In addition, several topological flat bands with large flatness\\nare identified. The two phases are separated by a dozen narrow topological\\nhigh-Chern-number segments, whose region shrinks as the magnetic field\\nincreases and vanishes eventually. We also find that the thermal Hall\\nconductivity approaches zero at certain parameters, and it changes (keeps) its\\nsign when crossing the topological phase-transition points (flat-band points).\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:25:11Z\"}"}
