{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03721v1\", \"title\": \"Sustainable Smart Farm Networks: Enhancing Resilience and Efficiency\\n  with Decision Theory-Guided Deep Reinforcement Learning\", \"summary\": \"Solar sensor-based monitoring systems have become a crucial agricultural\\ninnovation, advancing farm management and animal welfare through integrating\\nsensor technology, Internet-of-Things, and edge and cloud computing. However,\\nthe resilience of these systems to cyber-attacks and their adaptability to\\ndynamic and constrained energy supplies remain largely unexplored. To address\\nthese challenges, we propose a sustainable smart farm network designed to\\nmaintain high-quality animal monitoring under various cyber and adversarial\\nthreats, as well as fluctuating energy conditions. Our approach utilizes deep\\nreinforcement learning (DRL) to devise optimal policies that maximize both\\nmonitoring effectiveness and energy efficiency. To overcome DRL's inherent\\nchallenge of slow convergence, we integrate transfer learning (TL) and decision\\ntheory (DT) to accelerate the learning process. By incorporating DT-guided\\nstrategies, we optimize monitoring quality and energy sustainability,\\nsignificantly reducing training time while achieving comparable performance\\nrewards. Our experimental results prove that DT-guided DRL outperforms\\nTL-enhanced DRL models, improving system performance and reducing training\\nruntime by 47.5%.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.MA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T17:49:06Z\"}"}
