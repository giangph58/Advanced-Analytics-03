{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15945v1\", \"title\": \"Selmer stability for elliptic curves in Galois $\\\\ell$-extensions\", \"summary\": \"We study the behavior of Selmer groups of an elliptic curve $E/\\\\mathbb{Q}$ in\\nfinite Galois extensions with prescribed Galois group. Fix a prime $\\\\ell \\\\geq\\n5$, a finite group $G$ with $\\\\#G = \\\\ell^n$, and an elliptic curve\\n$E/\\\\mathbb{Q}$ with $Sel_\\\\ell(E/\\\\mathbb{Q}) = 0$ and surjective mod-$\\\\ell$\\nGalois representation. We show that there exist infinitely many Galois\\nextensions $F/\\\\mathbb{Q}$ with Galois group $Gal(F/\\\\mathbb{Q}) \\\\simeq G$ for\\nwhich the $\\\\ell$-Selmer group $Sel_\\\\ell(E/F)$ also vanishes. We obtain an\\nasymptotic lower bound for the number $M(G, E; X)$ of such fields $F$ with\\nabsolute discriminant $|\\\\Delta_F|\\\\leq X$, proving that there is an explicit\\nconstant $\\\\delta>0$ such that $M(G, E; X) \\\\gg X^{\\\\frac{1}{\\\\ell^{n-1}(\\\\ell -\\n1)}} (\\\\log X)^{\\\\delta - 1}$. The asymptotic for $M(G, E; X)$ matches the\\nconjectural count for all $G$-extensions $F/\\\\mathbb{Q}$ for which\\n$|\\\\Delta_F|\\\\leq X$, up to a power of $\\\\log X$. This demonstrates that Selmer\\nstability is not a rare phenomenon.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T14:43:07Z\"}"}
