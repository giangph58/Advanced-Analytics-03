{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16437v1\", \"title\": \"Hardness of Median and Center in the Ulam Metric\", \"summary\": \"The classical rank aggregation problem seeks to combine a set X of n\\npermutations into a single representative \\\"consensus\\\" permutation. In this\\npaper, we investigate two fundamental rank aggregation tasks under the\\nwell-studied Ulam metric: computing a median permutation (which minimizes the\\nsum of Ulam distances to X) and computing a center permutation (which minimizes\\nthe maximum Ulam distance to X) in two settings.\\n  $\\\\bullet$ Continuous Setting: In the continuous setting, the median/center is\\nallowed to be any permutation. It is known that computing a center in the Ulam\\nmetric is NP-hard and we add to this by showing that computing a median is\\nNP-hard as well via a simple reduction from the Max-Cut problem. While this\\nresult may not be unexpected, it had remained elusive until now and confirms a\\nspeculation by Chakraborty, Das, and Krauthgamer [SODA '21].\\n  $\\\\bullet$ Discrete Setting: In the discrete setting, the median/center must\\nbe a permutation from the input set. We fully resolve the fine-grained\\ncomplexity of the discrete median and discrete center problems under the Ulam\\nmetric, proving that the naive $\\\\widetilde{O}(n^2 L)$-time algorithm (where L\\nis the length of the permutation) is conditionally optimal. This resolves an\\nopen problem raised by Abboud, Bateni, Cohen-Addad, Karthik C. S., and\\nSeddighin [APPROX '23]. Our reductions are inspired by the known fine-grained\\nlower bounds for similarity measures, but we face and overcome several new\\nhighly technical challenges.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS,cs.CC,cs.CG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T05:53:06Z\"}"}
