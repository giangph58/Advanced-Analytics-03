{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00348v1\", \"title\": \"Validation of a 24-hour-ahead Prediction model for a Residential\\n  Electrical Load under diverse climate\", \"summary\": \"Accurate household electrical energy demand prediction is essential for\\neffectively managing sustainable Energy Communities. Integrated with the Energy\\nManagement System, these communities aim to optimise operational costs.\\nHowever, most existing forecasting models are region-specific and depend on\\nlarge datasets, limiting their applicability across different climates and\\ngeographical areas. These models often lack flexibility and may not perform\\nwell in regions with limited historical data, leading to inaccurate\\npredictions. This paper proposes a global model for 24-hour-ahead hourly\\nelectrical energy demand prediction that is designed to perform effectively\\nacross diverse climate conditions and datasets. The model's efficiency is\\ndemonstrated using data from two distinct regions: Ireland, with a maritime\\nclimate and Vietnam, with a tropical climate. Remarkably, the model achieves\\nhigh accuracy even with a limited dataset spanning only nine months. Its\\nrobustness is further validated across different seasons in Ireland (summer and\\nwinter) and Vietnam (dry and wet). The proposed model is evaluated against\\nstate-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning methods. Simulation results\\nindicate that the model consistently outperforms benchmark models, showcasing\\nits capability to provide reliable forecasts globally, regardless of varying\\nclimatic conditions and data availability. This research underscores the\\nmodel's potential to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of Energy\\nCommunities worldwide. The proposed model achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage\\nError of 8.0% and 4.0% on the full Irish and Vietnamese datasets.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T06:48:26Z\"}"}
