To analyze the ice absorption features\\nin the 8$-$22$\\\\mu$m, we first performed a continuum determination process on\\nmid-infrared spectra and applied a method to subtract the silicate absorption.\\nWe conducted a global fitting process to the absorption features in the\\ncombined infrared spectra using the experimental ice absorbance data to\\nidentify the intrinsic absorption of each ice component. We first derived the\\nH$_{2}$O ice column densities of both stretch and libration modes at 3.05$\\\\mu$m\\nand 13.6$\\\\mu$m simultaneously. We also identified the absorption features\\ncontaining NH$_{3}$, CH$_{3}$OH, CO$_{2}$, and CO and decomposed their mixed\\ncomponents and compared their ice abundances at different evolutionary stages\\nof the protostars. We explored possible absorptions of the organic ice species\\nsuch as HCOOH, CH$_{3}$CHO, and CH$_{3}$CH$_{2}$OH in the mid-infrared ranges.\\nThe ice analysis method developed in this study can be applied to the ice\\nspectra obtained by the James Webb Space Telescope.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T16:25:24Z\"}"}
