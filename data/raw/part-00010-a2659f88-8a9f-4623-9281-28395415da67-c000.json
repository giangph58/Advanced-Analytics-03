The latter is strongly\\naffected by surface active agents that are present in many applications.\\nSurfactants lead to local changes in the interfacial tension, which influence\\nthe mass transfer rates in two different ways. On the one hand, inhomogeneous\\ninterfacial tension leads to Marangoni stress, which can strongly change the\\nlocal hydrodynamics. One the other hand, the coverage by surfactant molecules\\nresults in a mass transfer resistance. This hindrance effect is not included in\\ncurrent continuum physical models. The present work provides the experimental\\nvalidation of a recently introduced extended sharp-interface model for\\ntwo-phase flows with mass transfer that also accounts for the mass transfer\\nhindrance due to adsorbed surfactant. The crucial feature is to account for\\narea-specific concentrations not only of adsorbed constituents but also of\\ntransfer species, and to model mass transfer as a series of two bi-directional\\nsorption-type bulk-interface exchange processes. The resulting model is shown\\nto quantitatively describe experimental measurements on mass transfer reduction\\nfor the dissolution of CO$_2$ bubbles in different surfactant solutions.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T15:12:04Z\"}"}
