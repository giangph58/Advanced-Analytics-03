We call this\\nprobability the \\\\textit{commuting degree} of a BCK-algebra. In a previous\\npaper, the author gave sharp upper and lower bounds for the commuting degree of\\na BCK-algebra with order $n$. We expand on those results in this paper: we show\\nthat, for each $n\\\\geq 3$, there is a BCK-algebra of order $n$ realizing each\\npossible commuting degree and that the minimum commuting degree is achieved by\\na unique BCK-algebra of order $n$ Additionally, we show that every rational\\nnumber in $(0,1]$ is the commuting degree of some finite BCK-algebra.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RA\", \"categories\": \"math.RA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T06:25:53Z\"}"}
