This interplay has profound implications for\\nmaterial design and emerging technologies. In this work, we set up variational\\nmodels for bulk-surface elasticity and explore a novel class of\\nsurface-polyconvex constitutive models that account for surface energy while\\nensuring the existence of minimizers. These models are implemented within a\\nfinite element framework and validated through benchmark problems and\\napplications, including, e.g., the liquid bridge problem and the\\nRayleigh-Plateau instability, for which the surface energy plays the dominant\\nrole. The results demonstrate the ability of surface-polyconvex models to\\naccurately capture surface-driven phenomena, establishing them as a powerful\\ntool for advancing the mechanics of soft materials in both engineering and\\nbiological applications.\", \"main_category\": \"math-ph\", \"categories\": \"math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:41:37Z\"}"}
