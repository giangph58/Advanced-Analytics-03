The\\npolarization dependence on collision centrality is explored and found to show\\nan increasing trend in more peripheral collisions. Dependencies on transverse\\nmomentum and pseudorapidity are investigated for Lambda and Anti-Lambda\\nhyperons, but no significant dependence has been observed. The polarization\\nmeasurements for Lambda and Anti-Lambda are consistent with each other,\\nindicating little contribution of the spin-magnetic coupling in the observed\\npolarization. The results for Lambda hyperons measurements are qualitatively\\nconsistent with hydrodynamic calculations incorporating effects from\\nshear-induced polarization and thermal vorticity, and show no obvious system\\nsize dependence in comparison with previous results in Au+Au collisions. For\\nthe first time, the dependence of the polarization on the hyperon's emission\\nazimuthal angle with respect to the second harmonic event plane is extracted\\nand shows stronger polarization for the in-plane emitted hyperons at the level\\nof 2.4$\\\\sigma$ significance in 20-50% centrality. The measurements of Xi\\nhyperons polarization via the polarization transfer analysis exhibit a finite\\npositive polarization, 2.9$\\\\sigma$ significance in 20-50% centrality, slightly\\nenhanced compared to the inclusive Lambda polarization.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-ex\", \"categories\": \"nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T08:32:56Z\"}"}
