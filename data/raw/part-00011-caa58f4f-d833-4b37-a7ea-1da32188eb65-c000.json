To address these challenges, we propose\\nthe LinTO audio and textual datasets -- comprehensive resources that capture\\nphonological and lexical features of Tunisian Arabic Dialect. These datasets\\ninclude a variety of texts from numerous sources and real-world audio samples\\nfeaturing diverse speakers and code-switching between Tunisian Arabic Dialect\\nand English or French. By providing high-quality audio paired with precise\\ntranscriptions, the LinTO audio and textual datasets aim to provide qualitative\\nmaterial to build and benchmark ASR systems for the Tunisian Arabic Dialect.\\n  Keywords -- Tunisian Arabic Dialect, Speech-to-Text, Low-Resource Languages,\\nAudio Data Augmentation\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.SD,eess.AS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:05:56Z\"}"}
