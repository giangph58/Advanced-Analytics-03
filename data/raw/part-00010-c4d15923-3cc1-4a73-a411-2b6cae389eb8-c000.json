{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16443v1\", \"title\": \"Marginalized Generalized IoU (MGIoU): A Unified Objective Function for\\n  Optimizing Any Convex Parametric Shapes\", \"summary\": \"Optimizing the similarity between parametric shapes is crucial for numerous\\ncomputer vision tasks, where Intersection over Union (IoU) stands as the\\ncanonical measure. However, existing optimization methods exhibit significant\\nshortcomings: regression-based losses like L1/L2 lack correlation with IoU,\\nIoU-based losses are unstable and limited to simple shapes, and task-specific\\nmethods are computationally intensive and not generalizable accross domains. As\\na result, the current landscape of parametric shape objective functions has\\nbecome scattered, with each domain proposing distinct IoU approximations. To\\naddress this, we unify the parametric shape optimization objective functions by\\nintroducing Marginalized Generalized IoU (MGIoU), a novel loss function that\\novercomes these challenges by projecting structured convex shapes onto their\\nunique shape Normals to compute one-dimensional normalized GIoU. MGIoU offers a\\nsimple, efficient, fully differentiable approximation strongly correlated with\\nIoU. We then extend MGIoU to MGIoU+ that supports optimizing unstructured\\nconvex shapes. Together, MGIoU and MGIoU+ unify parametric shape optimization\\nacross diverse applications. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate\\nthat MGIoU and MGIoU+ consistently outperform existing losses while reducing\\nloss computation latency by 10-40x. Additionally, MGIoU and MGIoU+ satisfy\\nmetric properties and scale-invariance, ensuring robustness as an objective\\nfunction. We further propose MGIoU- for minimizing overlaps in tasks like\\ncollision-free trajectory prediction.
