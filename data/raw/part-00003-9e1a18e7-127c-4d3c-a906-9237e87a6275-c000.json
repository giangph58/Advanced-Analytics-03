However, the velocity statistics show\\nnon-universality in three- and two-dimensional turbulence. Migdal (1995) proved\\nthe velocity circulation area rule which states the probability density\\nfunction (PDF) of circulation is only a function of the minimal surface area\\nenclosed by the loop but not the shape of the loop, and later a bifractal\\nuniversal behavior is found for circulation in three- and two-dimensional\\nturbulence and quantum turbulence (Iyer et al. 2019; M\\\\\\\"uller et al. 2021; Zhu\\net al. 2023). This paper finds that the velocity circulation area rule can be\\ngeneralized in two-dimensional instability-driven turbulence to all scales that\\nare not limited to the inertial range. However, similar to the\\nthree-dimensional case, the variance of circulation is size-dependent, and\\ncompared with the circulation PDFs, the variance-normalized PDFs have a\\nsignificantly weaker dependence on the shape of the loop. We also discussed the\\narea rule for 8-loops and double loops. We found that the normalized PDF\\ndepends only on the scalar area of the 8-loop. However, the area rule for other\\ncomplex loops, such as double loops, remains an open question.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T11:01:45Z\"}"}
