In this\\npaper, we explore a novel quaternionic representation of minimal surfaces,\\ndrawing an analogy with the well-established theory of Pythagorean Hodograph\\n(PH) curves. By exploiting the algebraic structure of complex quaternions, we\\nintroduce a new approach to generating minimal surfaces via quaternionic\\ntransformations. This method extends classical Weierstra\\\\ss-Enneper\\nrepresentations and provides insights into the interplay between quaternionic\\nanalysis, PH curves, and minimal surface geometry. Additionally, we discuss the\\nrole of the Sylvester equation in this framework and demonstrate practical\\nexamples, including the construction of Enneper surface patches. The findings\\nopen new avenues in computational geometry and geometric modeling, bridging\\nabstract algebraic structures with practical applications in CAD and computer\\ngraphics.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CV\", \"categories\": \"math.CV,math.RA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T08:51:05Z\"}"}
