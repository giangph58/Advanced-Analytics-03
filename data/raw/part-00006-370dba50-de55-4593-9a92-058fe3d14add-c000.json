{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00639v1\", \"title\": \"Probing excited-state dynamics of transmon ionization\", \"summary\": \"The fidelity and quantum nondemolition character of the dispersive readout in\\ncircuit QED are limited by unwanted transitions to highly excited states at\\nspecific photon numbers in the readout resonator. This observation can be\\nexplained by multiphoton resonances between computational states and highly\\nexcited states in strongly driven nonlinear systems, analogous to multiphoton\\nionization in atoms and molecules. In this work, we utilize the multilevel\\nnature of high-$E_J/E_C$ transmons to probe the excited-state dynamics induced\\nby strong drives during readout. With up to 10 resolvable states, we quantify\\nthe critical photon number of ionization, the resulting state after ionization,\\nand the fraction of the population transferred to highly excited states.\\nMoreover, using pulse-shaping to control the photon number in the readout\\nresonator in the high-power regime, we tune the adiabaticity of the transition\\nand verify that transmon ionization is a Landau-Zener-type transition. Our\\nexperimental results agree well with the theoretical prediction from a\\nsemiclassical driven transmon model and may guide future exploration of\\nstrongly driven nonlinear oscillators.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T16:28:03Z\"}"}
