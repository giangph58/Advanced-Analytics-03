Silicon photonic technologies, owing to their\\nhigh speed, low latency, large bandwidth, and complementary\\nmetal-oxide-semiconductor compatibility, have been widely implemented for data\\ntransfer and actively explored as photonic neural networks in AI clusters.\\nHowever, current silicon photonic integrated chips lack adaptability for\\nmultifuncional use and hardware-software systematic coordination. Here, we\\ndevelop a reconfigurable silicon photonic processor with $40$ programmable unit\\ncells integrating over $160$ component, which, to the best of our knowledge, is\\nthe first to realize diverse functions with a chip for AI clusters, from\\ncomputing acceleration and signal processing to network swtiching and secure\\nencryption. Through a self-developed automated testing, compilation, and tuning\\nframework to the processor without in-network monitoring photodetectors, we\\nimplement $4\\\\times4$ dual-direction unitary and $3\\\\times3$ uni-direction\\nnon-unitary matrix multiplications, neural networks for image recognition,\\nmicro-ring modulator wavelength locking, $4\\\\times4$ photonic channel switching\\n, and silicon photonic physical unclonable functions. This optoelectronic\\nprocessing system, incorporating the photonic processor and its software stack,\\npaves the way for both advanced photonic system-on-chip design and the\\nconstruction of photo-electronic AI clusters.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,cs.AR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:20:04Z\"}"}
