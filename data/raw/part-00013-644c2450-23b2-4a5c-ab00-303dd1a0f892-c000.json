However, for\\nsome time, discrepancies between model predictions and measured air-shower data\\nhave complicated efforts to accurately determine the mass composition of\\nultra-high-energy cosmic rays. A key inconsistency is the deficit of simulated\\nsignals compared to those measured with the surface detectors, typically\\ninterpreted as a deficit in the muon signal generated by the hadronic component\\nof simulated showers.\\n  Recently, a new global method has been applied to the combined data from the\\nsurface and fluorescence detectors at the Pierre Auger Observatory. This method\\nsimultaneously determines the mass composition of cosmic rays and evaluates\\nvariations in the simulated depth of the shower maximum and hadronic signals on\\nthe ground. The findings reveal not only the alleviated muon problem but also\\nshow that all current models of hadronic interactions predict depths of the\\nshower maximum that are too shallow, offering new insights into deficiencies in\\nthese models from a broader perspective.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T09:17:18Z\"}"}
