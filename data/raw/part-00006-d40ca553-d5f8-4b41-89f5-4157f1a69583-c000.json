Alice goes first and Bob goes second, and then each\\nvoter simply votes for the candidate closer to them in terms of Euclidean\\ndistance. If a voter's distance from the two candidates is the same, they vote\\nfor nobody. We give a geometric characterization of the sets $S$ for which each\\ncandidate wins, assuming that Alice wins if they get an equal number of votes.\\nWe also show that, if not all the voters lie on a single line, then, whenever\\nAlice has a winning strategy, there is a unique winning point for her. We also\\nprovide an algorithm which decides whether Alice has a winning point, and\\ndetermines the location of that point, both in finite (in fact polynomial)\\ntime.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T13:20:43Z\"}"}
