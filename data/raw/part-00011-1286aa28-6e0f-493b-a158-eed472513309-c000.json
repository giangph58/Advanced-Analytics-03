{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20396v1\", \"title\": \"Generalizing the Levins metapopulation model to time varying\\n  colonization and extinction rates\", \"summary\": \"The metapopulation theory explores the population persistence in fragmented\\nhabitats by considering a balance between the extinction of local populations\\nand recolonization of empty sites. In general, the extinction and colonization\\nrates have been considered as constant parameters and the novelty of this paper\\nis to assume that they are subject to deterministic variations. We noticed that\\nan averaging approach proposed by C. Puccia and R. Levins can be adapted to\\nconstruct the upper and lower averages of the difference between the extinction\\nand colonization rates, whose sign is useful to determine either the permanence\\nor the extinction of the metapopulation. In fact, we use these averages to\\nrevisit the classical model introduced by R. Levins. From a mathematical\\nperspective, these averages can be seen as Bohl exponents whereas the\\ncorresponding analysis is carried out by using tools of non autonomous\\ndynamics. Last but not least, compared with the Levins model, the resulting\\ndynamics of the time varying model shares the persistence/extinction scenario\\nwhen the above stated upper and lower averages have the same sign but also\\nraises open questions about metapopulation persistence in the case of the\\naverages have different sign.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.PE\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.PE,math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T03:38:47Z\"}"}
