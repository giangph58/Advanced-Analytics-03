We\\ntheoretically and numerically revealed that not only the physical error but\\nalso the algorithmic error in a single Trotter step decreases exponentially\\nwith the circuit depth. In particular, according to our results, we derive the\\noptimal number of Trotter steps and the noise requirement to guarantee total\\nsimulation precision. At last, we demonstrate that our improved error analysis\\nleads to significant resource-saving for fault-tolerant Trotter simulation. By\\naddressing these aspects, this work systematically characterizes the robustness\\nof Trotter simulation errors in noisy quantum devices and paves the way toward\\npractical quantum advantage.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T14:10:24Z\"}"}
