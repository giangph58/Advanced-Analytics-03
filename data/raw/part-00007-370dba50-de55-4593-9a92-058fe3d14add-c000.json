{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00640v1\", \"title\": \"Dynamics of Thin Lubricant Films upon Liquid Contact on Slippery\\n  Surfaces\", \"summary\": \"In recent years, slippery surfaces have attracted significant interest due to\\ntheir excellent liquid-repellent properties and their potential in diverse\\ncommercial applications. Such surfaces are prepared by coating functionalized\\nsolid substrates with a thin lubricant film that prevents direct contact\\nbetween a liquid and the substrate. The morphology of thin films upon liquid\\ncontact plays a central role in governing various phenomena, including the\\ncoalescence and mobility of liquid droplets, heat transfer efficiency, and the\\nextent of lubricant depletion. However, a detailed understanding of film\\ndynamics upon droplet contact remains limited, both from theoretical and\\nexperimental perspectives. Here, by employing principles of fluid dynamics,\\noptics, and surface wetting, we present a comprehensive study that examines\\nboth the spatial and temporal variations of lubricant films upon contact with\\nsessile liquid droplets and liquid bridges. Our findings reveal that the film\\ndynamics can be categorized into three distinct stages, each significantly\\ninfluenced by key system parameters: initial film thickness, three-phase\\ncontact line width, and Laplace pressure of liquids. Furthermore, we\\ndemonstrate that by optimizing these parameters, it is possible to reverse the\\nlubricant flow in the final stage, thereby causing the liquid to partially lift\\noff from the slippery surface.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T16:28:58Z\"}"}
