In reality, the key metric for the effective\\noperation of a circular collider is the integrated luminosity provided to the\\nexperiments, which can significantly differ from the theoretical capability\\nregarding instantaneous luminosity of the accelerator. Several factors\\ninfluence the collection of integrated luminosity, with the most critical being\\nthe duration of each physics fill. This paper presents and examines strategies\\nfor determining optimal fill durations based on actual fill conditions,\\napplying these methods to public luminosity data measured by the ATLAS detector\\nduring the LHC Run~2, covering the physics runs from 2016 to 2018.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.acc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.acc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T08:44:43Z\"}"}
