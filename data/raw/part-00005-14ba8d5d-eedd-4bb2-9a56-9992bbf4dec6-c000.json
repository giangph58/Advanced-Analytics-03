Unlike existing repulsive mixture approaches\\nthat focus on separating the component means, our method encourages separation\\nbetween mixture components based on the Wasserstein distance. We establish\\nposterior contraction rates within the framework of nonparametric density\\nestimation. Posterior sampling is performed using a blocked-collapsed Gibbs\\nsampler. Through simulation studies and real data applications, we demonstrate\\nthe effectiveness of the proposed model.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T07:46:48Z\"}"}
