{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04334v1\", \"title\": \"FRET-Enhanced Singlet Fission in Pentacene Derivatives\", \"summary\": \"Conversion of solar energy with high quantum efficiencies is a key challenge\\nin energy technologies. Excitation energy transfer (EET) mechanisms, such as\\nF\\\\\\\"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET), play a crucial role in facilitating\\nminimal energy loss in biological light-harvesting systems by directing\\nexcitation energy to conversion centers. Inspired by this, we show that singlet\\nfission (SF) sensitizers are multi-exciton generation centers, to which\\nsurrounding molecules funnel excitation energy via FRET. We study the impact of\\nsuch EET on SF using two structurally distinct yet optically similar pentacene\\nderivatives: a stability-enhanced ''Gel\\\\\\\"ander'' pentacene, and the\\nwell-studied TIPS-pentacene. Transient absorption spectroscopy reveals a\\n$R^{6}$ dependence of the SF rate on molecular separation $R$ in binary\\nacene:polymethylmetacrylate thin film blends, which is typical for FRET.\\nOptimizing FRET is a promising direction for future improvements in light\\nharvesting using SF materials, inspired by natural light-harvesting complexes.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T11:29:23Z\"}"}
