The contribution of the paper is rooted in a measured-state\\ninitialization strategy. First, due to the nonzero probability of violating\\nchance-constraints in the case of unbounded noise, we introduce\\nellipsoidal-based probabilistic reachable sets and we include constraint\\nrelaxations to recover recursive feasibility conditioned to the measured state.\\nSecond, we prove that the solution of this novel SMPC scheme guarantees\\nclosed-loop chance constraints satisfaction under minimum relaxation. Last, we\\ndemonstrate that, in expectation, the need of relaxing the constraints vanishes\\nover time, which leads the closed-loop trajectories steered towards the\\nunconstrained LQR invariant region. This novel SMPC scheme is proven to satisfy\\nthe recursive feasibility conditioned to the state realization, and its\\nsuperiority with respect to open-loop initialization schemes is shown through\\nnumerical examples.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T16:26:22Z\"}"}
