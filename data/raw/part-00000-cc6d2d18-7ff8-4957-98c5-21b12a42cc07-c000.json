This\\ndifficulty can sometimes be evaded by decomposing the band into a basis of\\nextended itinerant states and a lattice of local states, using the heavy\\nfermion prescription. We revisit this framework by systematically identifying\\nthe dominant interaction channels guided by the eigenvalues of the projected\\ndensity operator. This approach can be applied both to tight-binding and\\ncontinuum models, allowing us to identify a hierarchy in interaction scales\\nthat can be universally used to reduce the Hilbert space dimension and\\ndetermine an appropriate local basis for modeling electronic correlations in\\ninteracting topological materials.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:26:23Z\"}"}
