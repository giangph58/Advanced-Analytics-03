{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15684v1\", \"title\": \"Hydrogen-poor Superluminous Supernovae with Bumpy Light Curves Powered\\n  by Precessing Magnetars\", \"summary\": \"Recent observations and statistical studies have revealed that a significant\\nfraction of hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) exhibit light\\ncurves that deviate from the smooth evolution predicted by the magnetar-powered\\nmodel, instead showing one or more bumps after the primary peak. However, the\\nformation mechanisms of these post-peak bumps remain a matter of debate.\\nFurthermore, previous studies employing the magnetar-powered model have\\ntypically assumed a fixed magnetic inclination angle and neglected the effects\\nof magnetar precession. However, recent research has shown that the precession\\nof newborn magnetars forming during the collapse of massive stars causes the\\nmagnetic inclination angle to evolve over time, thereby influencing magnetic\\ndipole radiation. In this paper, therefore, we incorporate the effects of\\nmagnetar precession into the magnetar-powered model to develop the precessing\\nmagnetar-powered model. Using this model, we successfully reproduce the\\nmulti-band light curves of 6 selected representative SLSNe-I with post-peak\\nbumps. Moreover, the derived model parameters fall within the typical parameter\\nrange for SLSNe-I. By combining the precessing magnetars in SLSNe-I and long\\nGRBs, we find that the ellipticity of magnetars is related to the dipole\\nmagnetic field strength, which may suggest a common origin for the two\\nphenomena. Our work provides a potential explanation for the origin of\\npost-peak bumps in SLSNe-I and offers evidence for the early precession of\\nnewborn magnetars formed in supernova explosions.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T08:07:50Z\"}"}
