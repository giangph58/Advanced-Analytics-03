Starting\\nfrom the evolution equations for the density fields $\\\\rho_i(\\\\vec r, t)$\\ndescribing MIPS, we phenomenologically incorporate the effects of the reaction\\nthrough the reaction rate $\\\\Gamma$ into the equations. The steady-state domain\\nmorphologies depend on $\\\\Gamma$ and the relative activity of the species,\\n$\\\\Delta$. For a sufficiently large $\\\\Gamma$ and $\\\\Delta\\\\ne 1$, the more active\\ncomponent of the mixture forms a droplet morphology. We characterize the\\nmorphology of domains by calculating the equal-time correlation function $C(r,\\nt)$ and the structure factor $S(k, t)$, exhibiting scaling violation. The\\naverage domain size, $L(t)$, follows a diffusive growth as $L(t)\\\\sim t^{1/3}$\\nbefore reaching the steady state domain size, $L_{\\\\rm ss}$. Additionally,\\n$L_{\\\\rm ss}$ shows the scaling relation $L_{\\\\rm ss}\\\\sim\\\\Gamma^{-1/4}$,\\nindependent of $\\\\Delta$.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T06:38:20Z\"}"}
