{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06717v1\", \"title\": \"Optimal Execution and Macroscopic Market Making\", \"summary\": \"We propose a stochastic game modelling the strategic interaction between\\nmarket makers and traders of optimal execution type. For traders, the permanent\\nprice impact commonly attributed to them is replaced by quoting strategies\\nimplemented by market makers. For market makers, order flows become endogenous,\\ndriven by tactical traders rather than assumed exogenously. Using the\\nforward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE) characterization of\\nNash equilibria, we establish a local well-posedness result for the general\\ngame. In the specific Almgren-Chriss-Avellaneda-Stoikov model, a decoupling\\napproach guarantees the global well-posedness of the FBSDE system via the\\nwell-posedness of an associated backward stochastic Riccati equation. Finally,\\nby introducing small diffusion terms into the inventory processes, global\\nwell-posedness is achieved for the approximation game.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.TR\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.TR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T09:18:37Z\"}"}
