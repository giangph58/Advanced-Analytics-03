While traditional approaches often suffer from data sparsity and\\nlimited information sharing between objectives, recent methods utilizing a\\nshared network alongside dedicated sub-networks for each objective partially\\naddress these limitations. However, such methods significantly increase the\\nmodel parameters, leading to an increased retrieval latency and a limited\\nability to model causal relationships between objectives. To address these\\nchallenges, we propose the Cascaded Selective Mask Fine-Tuning (CSMF), a novel\\nmethod that enhances both retrieval efficiency and serving performance for\\nmulti-objective EBR. The CSMF framework selectively masks model parameters to\\nfree up independent learning space for each objective, leveraging the cascading\\nrelationships between objectives during the sequential fine-tuning. Without\\nincreasing network parameters or online retrieval overhead, CSMF computes a\\nlinearly weighted fusion score for multiple objective probabilities while\\nsupporting flexible adjustment of each objective's weight across various\\nrecommendation scenarios. Experimental results on real-world datasets\\ndemonstrate the superior performance of CSMF, and online experiments validate\\nits significant practical value.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR,H.3.3\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T13:10:56Z\"}"}
