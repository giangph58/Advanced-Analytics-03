{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07859v1\", \"title\": \"Conversion-Driven Freeze-Out: A Common Framework for Dark Matter and\\n  Baryogenesis\", \"summary\": \"We explore dark matter genesis beyond the WIMP paradigm, focusing on the\\nmechanism of conversion-driven freeze-out. This mechanism enables the\\nthermalization of dark matter despite its very weak couplings. While the\\nscenario evades conventional WIMP searches, it predicts novel signatures of\\nlong-lived particles at colliders, making it a prime target for upcoming LHC\\nsearches. We review various model realizations of this mechanism, highlighting\\nits deep connections to other unresolved problems of the Standard Model. In\\nparticular, we show how conversion-driven freeze-out can naturally give rise to\\nbaryogenesis, offering a compelling perspective on the origins of both dark and\\nbaryonic matter.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:35:53Z\"}"}
