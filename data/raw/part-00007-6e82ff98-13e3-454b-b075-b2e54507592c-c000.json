{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15871v1\", \"title\": \"Long-term disparities in the recovery of urban mobility after COVID-19\\n  in Latin America\", \"summary\": \"The COVID-19 pandemic caused unprecedented disruptions to the patterns of\\nurban mobility. Existing work has overwhelmingly focused on the immediate\\nimpacts of COVID-19 on human mobility during 2020, particularly in countries of\\nthe Global North. It showed that the pandemic resulted in an increased gap,\\nbenefitted affluent and core urban areas with larger reductions in mobility.\\nYet, little is know about the long-term persistence of these unequal impacts\\nbeyond 2020, and in countries of the Global South where socioeconomic\\ndisparities are more acute. Using over 100 million anonymised daily records of\\nmobile phone data from Meta-Facebook users from March 2020 to May 2022, we aim\\nto determine the long-term geographic and socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 on\\nmobility patterns in Latin America. Our findings reveal that the mobility\\ndisparities triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic have endured, with affluent and\\ndensely populated areas displaying lower mobility rates than more deprived and\\nsparsely populated places. We also show that the magnitude of the reduction in\\nmobility levels early in the COVID-19 pandemic largely determined the extent of\\nmobility differential between socioeconomic groups. We find no signs of full\\nrecovery to baseline levels of mobility in some urban cores, suggesting some\\nlost of appeal as attractors of economic activity. Overall, our findings\\nsuggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to amplified pre-existing\\nsocioeconomic inequalities and redefined the role of cities in Latin American\\ncountries.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T13:15:50Z\"}"}
