Competing magnetic interactions and\\nsuperconducting pairing lead to a rich phase diagram. Using a scanning\\ntunneling microscope (STM), we position Fe atoms on 2H-NbSe$_2$ to build a\\ndimer with an odd-parity ground state, i.e., a partially screened YSR channel\\nwith the hybridized states spanning the Fermi level. This ground state makes\\nthe dimer a promising precursor for a topological YSR chain. By adding one atom\\nat a time, we track the formation of YSR bands. The lowest-energy band crosses\\nthe Fermi level and we find strong site-dependent spectral variations\\nespecially at the chain's terminations. We attribute these features to quantum\\nspin effects and ferromagnetic coupling influenced by the local chemical\\nenvironment, rather than topological superconductivity or Majorana modes.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:08:02Z\"}"}
