Avoshifts\\nare subshifts where for each convex set $C$, and each vector $v$ such that $C\\n\\\\cup \\\\{\\\\vec v\\\\}$ is also convex, the set of valid extensions of globally valid\\npatterns on $C$ to ones on $C \\\\cup \\\\{v\\\\}$ is determined by a bounded subpattern\\nof $C$. Unishifts are the subshifts where for such $C, \\\\vec v$, every\\n$C$-pattern has the same number of $\\\\vec v$-extensions. Cellwise quasigroup\\nshifts (including group shifts) and TEP subshifts are examples of unishifts,\\nwhile unishifts and subshifts with topological strong spatial mixing are\\nexamples of avoshifts. We prove that every avoshift is the spacetime subshift\\nof a nondeterministic cellular automaton on an avoshift of lower dimension up\\nto a linear transformation and a convex blocking. From this, we deduce that all\\navoshifts contain periodic points, and that unishifts have dense periodic\\npoints and admit equal entropy full shift factors.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS,math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T11:10:27Z\"}"}
