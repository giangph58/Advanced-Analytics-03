{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16909v1\", \"title\": \"The CKN inequality for spinors: symmetry and symmetry breaking\", \"summary\": \"This paper is devoted to Sobolev interpolation inequalities for spinors, with\\nweights of Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg (CKN) type. In view of the corresponding\\nresults for scalar functions, a natural question is to determine whether\\noptimal spinors have symmetry properties, or whether spinors with symmetry\\nproperties are linearly unstable, in which case we shall say that symmetry\\nbreaking occurs. What symmetry means has to be carefully defined and the\\noverall picture turns out to be richer than in the scalar case. So far, no\\nsymmetrization technique is available in the spinorial case. We can however\\ndetermine a range of the parameters for which symmetry holds using a detailed\\nanalysis based mostly on spectral methods.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T17:37:38Z\"}"}
