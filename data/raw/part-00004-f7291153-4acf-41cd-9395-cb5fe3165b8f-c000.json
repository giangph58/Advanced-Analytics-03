It enables scalable error characterization,\\nanalysis of how noise impacts quantum algorithms, and optimized implementations\\nof quantum error correction. However, most existing efficient simulation\\ntechniques can only simulate the effects of stochastic (incoherent) noise. The\\nlack of efficient ways to simulate coherent errors, which are common and\\nsignificant in contemporary quantum computing systems, has frustrated research.\\nWe remedy this gap by introducing an efficient algorithm for approximate\\nsimulation of Clifford circuits with arbitrary small errors (including coherent\\nerrors) that can be described by sparse $n$-qubit Lindbladians. We use this\\nalgorithm to study the impact of coherent errors on syndrome extract circuits\\nfor distance-3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 rotated surface codes, and on deep random\\n225-qubit circuits containing over a million gates.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T14:23:56Z\"}"}
