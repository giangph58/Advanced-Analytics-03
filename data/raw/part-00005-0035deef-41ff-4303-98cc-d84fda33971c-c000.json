Forward in time, we prove a functional limit theorem in\\nthe space of trajectories of the linearly-scaled $h$-transformed process; the\\nchange of measure allows us to work on the same probability space for all\\ntimes. Backward in time, we trace the lines of descent of individuals sampled\\nfrom a (stationary) population and analyse the ancestral type distribution,\\nthat is, the type distribution of the ancestors in the distant past, as well as\\nthe type process along the ancestral line.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:56:26Z\"}"}
