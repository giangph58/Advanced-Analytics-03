When all\\nprocessing times follow Bernoulli-type distributions, Gupta et al. (SODA '23)\\nexhibited approximation algorithms with an approximation guarantee\\n$\\\\tilde{\\\\text{O}}(\\\\sqrt{m})$, where $m$ is the number of machines and\\n$\\\\tilde{\\\\text{O}}(\\\\cdot)$ suppresses polylogarithmic factors in $N$, improving\\nupon an earlier ${\\\\text{O}}(m)$ approximation by Eberle et al. (OR Letters '19)\\nfor a special case. The present paper shows that, quite unexpectedly, the\\nproblem with Bernoulli-type jobs admits a PTAS whenever the number of different\\njob-size parameters is bounded by a constant. The result is based on a series\\nof transformations of an optimal scheduling policy to a \\\"stratified\\\" policy\\nthat makes scheduling decisions at specific points in time only, while losing\\nonly a negligible factor in expected cost. An optimal stratified policy is\\ncomputed using dynamic programming. Two technical issues are solved, namely (i)\\nto ensure that, with at most a slight delay, the stratified policy has an\\ninformation advantage over the optimal policy, allowing it to simulate its\\ndecisions, and (ii) to ensure that the delays do not accumulate, thus solving\\nthe trade-off between the complexity of the scheduling policy and its expected\\ncost. Our results also imply a quasi-polynomial $\\\\text{O}(\\\\log\\nN)$-approximation for the case with an arbitrary number of job sizes.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T09:18:09Z\"}"}
