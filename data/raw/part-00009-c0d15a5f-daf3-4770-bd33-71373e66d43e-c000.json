However,\\nensuring the security of smart contracts remains a persistent challenge across\\nthe stages of development, compilation, and execution. Vulnerabilities within\\nsmart contracts not only undermine the security of individual applications but\\nalso pose significant risks to the broader blockchain ecosystem, as\\ndemonstrated by the growing frequency of attacks since 2016, resulting in\\nsubstantial financial losses. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of\\nkey security risks in Ethereum smart contracts, specifically those written in\\nSolidity and executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). We focus on two\\nprevalent and critical vulnerability types (reentrancy and integer overflow) by\\nexamining their underlying mechanisms, replicating attack scenarios, and\\nassessing effective countermeasures.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.AI,cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T10:00:36Z\"}"}
