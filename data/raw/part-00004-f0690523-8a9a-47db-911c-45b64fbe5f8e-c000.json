{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07512v1\", \"title\": \"Infrared Spectroscopy of Pentagon-Containing PAHs: Indenyl and Fluorenyl\\n  Anions and Indenyl Cation\", \"summary\": \"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) ions are crucial intermediates in\\ninterstellar chemistry and may play a key role in the infrared emission\\nfeatures observed in space. Here, we investigate the infrared spectra of the\\nindenyl (C$_9$H$_7^-$) and fluorenyl (C$_{13}$H$_9^-$) anions and the indenyl\\ncation (C$_9$H$_7^+$) using infrared pre-dissociation (IRPD) spectroscopy. The\\nexperiments were performed in a cryogenic 22 pole ion trap at the FELion\\nbeamline of the tunable free-electron laser FELIX. Spectral analysis of the two\\nanionic PAHs, in combination with density functional theory (DFT) computations,\\nrevealed key vibrational modes near 1300 cm$^{-1}$, making these ions potential\\ncarriers of the 7.7 {\\\\mu}m PAH emission band seen in many astronomical objects.\\nThe feature-rich spectrum of cationic indenyl could not be entirely explained\\nby modeling through time-independent anharmonic DFT calculations. Although a\\nbetter match has been achieved through molecular dynamics simulations, we\\ncannot completely rule out the presence of multiple cationic isomers of the\\nH-loss fragments of indene in the experiments.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T07:14:45Z\"}"}
