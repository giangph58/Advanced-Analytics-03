In certain domains like\\nmaterial performance screening, dimensionality is large and collecting labels\\nis expensive and lengthy. It highly necessitates transforming feature spaces\\nefficiently and without supervision to enhance data readiness and AI utility.\\nHowever, existing methods fall short in efficient navigation of a vast space of\\nfeature combinations, and are mostly designed for supervised settings. To fill\\nthis gap, our unique perspective is to leverage a generator-critic duet-play\\nteaming framework using LLM agents and in-context learning to derive\\npseudo-supervision from unsupervised data. The framework consists of three\\ninterconnected steps: (1) Critic agent diagnoses data to generate actionable\\nadvice, (2) Generator agent produces tokenized feature transformations guided\\nby the critic's advice, and (3) Iterative refinement ensures continuous\\nimprovement through feedback between agents. The generator-critic framework can\\nbe generalized to human-agent collaborative generation, by replacing the critic\\nagent with human experts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed\\nframework outperforms even supervised baselines in feature transformation\\nefficiency, robustness, and practical applicability across diverse datasets.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T04:26:03Z\"}"}
