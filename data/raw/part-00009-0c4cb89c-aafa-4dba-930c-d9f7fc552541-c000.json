{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04936v1\", \"title\": \"Fluid Antenna-Assisted MU-MIMO Systems with Decentralized Baseband\\n  Processing\", \"summary\": \"The fluid antenna system (FAS) has emerged as a disruptive technology,\\noffering unprecedented degrees of freedom (DoF) for wireless communication\\nsystems. However, optimizing fluid antenna (FA) positions entails significant\\ncomputational costs, especially when the number of FAs is large. To address\\nthis challenge, we introduce a decentralized baseband processing (DBP)\\narchitecture to FAS, which partitions the FA array into clusters and enables\\nparallel processing. Based on the DBP architecture, we formulate a weighted sum\\nrate (WSR) maximization problem through joint beamforming and FA position\\ndesign for FA-assisted multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO)\\nsystems. To solve the WSR maximization problem, we propose a novel\\ndecentralized block coordinate ascent (BCA)-based algorithm that leverages\\nmatrix fractional programming (FP) and majorization-minimization (MM) methods.\\nThe proposed decentralized algorithm achieves low computational, communication,\\nand storage costs, thus unleashing the potential of the DBP architecture.\\nSimulation results show that our proposed algorithm under the DBP architecture\\nreduces computational time by over 70% compared to centralized architectures\\nwith negligible WSR performance loss.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,eess.SP,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T04:26:21Z\"}"}
