{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07814v1\", \"title\": \"Estimating entanglement monotones of non-pure spin-squeezed states\", \"summary\": \"We investigate how to estimate entanglement monotones of general mixed\\nmany-body quantum states via lower and upper bounds from entanglement witnesses\\nand separable ansatz states respectively. This allows us to study spin systems\\non fully-connected graphs at nonzero temperature. We derive lower bounds to\\ndistance-like measure from the set of fully separable states based on\\nspin-squeezing inequalities. These are nonlinear expressions based on variances\\nof collective spin operators and are potentially close to optimal in the large\\nparticle-number limit, at least for models with two-particle interactions.\\nConcretely, we apply our methods to equilibrium states of the\\npermutation-invariant XXZ model with an external field and investigate\\nentanglement at nonzero temperature close to quantum phase transition (QPT)\\npoints in both the ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic cases. We observe that\\nthe lower bound becomes tight for zero temperature as well as for the\\ntemperature at which entanglement disappears, both of which are thus precisely\\ncaptured by the spin-squeezing inequalities. We further observe, among other\\nthings, that entanglement arises at nonzero temperature close to a QPT even in\\nthe ordered phase, where the ground state is separable. This can be considered\\nan entanglement signature of a QPT that may also be visible in experiments.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:51:18Z\"}"}
