The analysis uses a 365 fb$^{-1}$\\ndata sample recorded at the center-of-mass energy of the $\\\\Upsilon(4S)$\\nresonance. One of the $B$ mesons produced in the $\\\\Upsilon(4S)\\\\to B^0\\n\\\\bar{B}^0$ process is fully reconstructed in a hadronic decay mode, while its\\ncompanion $B$ meson is required to decay into a $K^{\\\\ast 0}$ and two $\\\\tau$\\nleptons of opposite charge. The $\\\\tau$ leptons are reconstructed in final\\nstates with a single electron, muon, charged pion or charged $\\\\rho$ meson, and\\nadditional neutrinos. We set an upper limit on the branching ratio of $BR(B^0\\n\\\\to K^{\\\\ast 0} \\\\tau^+ \\\\tau^-) < 1.8 \\\\times 10^{-3}$ at the 90% confidence\\nlevel, which is the most stringent constraint reported to date.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:43:05Z\"}"}
