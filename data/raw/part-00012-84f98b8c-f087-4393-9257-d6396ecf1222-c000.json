Some see the tool's ability to\\ngenerate human-like text that passes at least cursory inspections for factual\\naccuracy ``often enough'' a golden age of information retrieval and\\ncomputer-assisted learning. Some, on the other hand, worry the tool may lead to\\nunprecedented levels of academic dishonesty and cheating. In this work, we\\nquantify some of the effects of the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs)\\non online education by analyzing a multi-year dataset of student essay\\nresponses from a free university-level MOOC on AI ethics. Our dataset includes\\nessays submitted both before and after ChatGPT's release. We find that the\\nlaunch of ChatGPT coincided with significant changes in both the length and\\nstyle of student essays, mirroring observations in other contexts such as\\nacademic publishing. We also observe -- as expected based on related public\\ndiscourse -- changes in prevalence of key content words related to AI and LLMs,\\nbut not necessarily the general themes or topics discussed in the student\\nessays as identified through (dynamic) topic modeling.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY,cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T15:51:59Z\"}"}
