{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02292v1\", \"title\": \"Unifying Different Theories of Conformal Prediction\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents a unified framework for understanding the methodology and\\ntheory behind several different methods in the conformal prediction literature,\\nwhich includes standard conformal prediction (CP), weighted conformal\\nprediction (WCP), nonexchangeable conformal prediction (NexCP), and\\nrandomly-localized conformal prediction (RLCP), among others. At the crux of\\nour framework is the idea that conformal methods are based on revealing partial\\ninformation about the data at hand, and positing a conditional distribution for\\nthe data given the partial information. Different methods arise from different\\nchoices of partial information, and of the corresponding (approximate)\\nconditional distribution. In addition to recovering and unifying existing\\nresults, our framework leads to both new theoretical guarantees for existing\\nmethods, and new extensions of the conformal methodology.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T05:46:26Z\"}"}
