We realize these bounds as a consequence of estimates\\nthat we establish, via simple arguments, for the associated exotic\\nparaproducts. As a further application, we observe bounds beyond the local\\n$L^2$ range for bilinear multipliers whose symbol is the characteristic\\nfunction of the epigraph of convex polygonal curves associated with these\\nparaproducts.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CA\", \"categories\": \"math.CA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T15:44:38Z\"}"}
