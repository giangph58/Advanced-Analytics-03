{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06685v1\", \"title\": \"Testing Multivariate Conditional Independence Using Exchangeable\\n  Sampling and Sufficient Statistics\", \"summary\": \"We consider testing multivariate conditional independence between a response\\nY and a covariate vector X given additional variables Z. We introduce the\\nMultivariate Sufficient Statistic Conditional Randomization Test (MS-CRT),\\nwhich generates exchangeable copies of X by conditioning on sufficient\\nstatistics of P(X|Z). MS-CRT requires no modelling assumption on Y and\\naccommodates any test statistics, including those derived from complex\\npredictive models. It relaxes the assumptions of standard conditional\\nrandomization tests by allowing more unknown parameters in P(X|Z) than the\\nsample size. MS-CRT avoids multiplicity corrections and effectively detects\\njoint signals, even when individual components of X have only weak effects on Y\\n. Our method extends to group selection with false discovery rate control. We\\ndevelop efficient implementations for two important cases where P(X,Z) is\\neither multivariate normal or belongs to a graphical model. For normal models,\\nwe establish the minimax rate optimality. For graphical models, we demonstrate\\nthe superior performance of our method compared to existing methods through\\ncomprehensive simulations and real-data examples.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T08:42:18Z\"}"}
