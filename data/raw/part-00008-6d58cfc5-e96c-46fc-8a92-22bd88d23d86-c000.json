{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04602v1\", \"title\": \"Extracting local velocity from cosmic dipole using simulations\", \"summary\": \"Our velocity with respect to the cosmic frame of rest leads to a dipole in\\nthe number count distribution of galaxies. The dipole depends on the source\\nspectrum, which is usually assumed to be a power law, $S(\\\\nu) \\\\propto\\n\\\\nu^{-\\\\alpha}$ and on the flux dependence of the number density of sources. The\\nlatter is also generally assumed to be a power law, parametrised with exponent\\n$x$. The velocity can be extracted from the observed dipole once the two\\nparameters $x$ and $\\\\alpha$ are known. The standard procedure uses the mean\\nvalue of $\\\\alpha$ across the entire sample, and the parameter $x$ is inferred\\nby fitting the cumulative number count, $\\\\frac{dN}{d\\\\Omega}(>S_*) \\\\propto\\nS_*^{-x}$, near the flux limit $S_*$ of the survey. Here, we introduce a\\nsimulation procedure to extract the velocity which directly uses the $\\\\alpha$\\nvalues of each source rather than their mean and does not rely on the\\nfunctional form of the cumulative number count near the flux limit. We apply\\nthis to the quasar sample in CatWISE2020 data and find that the final results\\ndiffer from the standard procedure by approximately one sigma.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T17:48:56Z\"}"}
