Is it sufficient when humans discuss this with other humans?\\nOr, given that AI is increasingly becoming a viable source of inspiration for\\npeople (and let alone the hypothetical possibility that the technology may at\\nsome point become \\\"artificial general intelligence\\\" and/or develop\\nconsciousness), should AI not join the discourse? There are new questions and\\nangles that AI brings to the table that we might not have considered before -\\nso let us make the key subject of this book an active participant. This chapter\\ntherefore includes a brief human-AI conversation on the topic of AI rights and\\nethics.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T07:59:17Z\"}"}
