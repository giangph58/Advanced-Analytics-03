This\\npaper extends this method to practical implementation by deriving the\\nmultipolar expansion of the longitudinal electric field in such RF cavities\\nwith beam pipes, as well as the momentum change of ultra-relativistic particles\\ntraversing these modes. The derived equations explicitly show the radial\\nvariation of the change in longitudinal and transverse momentum follows a\\npolynomial rather than Bessel-function relationship. The expression for the\\nlongitudinal electric field is then compared to a field map obtained from the\\n3D electromagnetic simulation of an azimuthally modulated cavity designed to\\nsupport a mode composed of monopole, dipole, and quadrupole components. Beam\\ndynamics studies are presented to assess the derived expressions for the change\\nin momentum, including the effects of relaxing the ultra-relativistic\\nassumption. Finally, two example applications are presented: the first\\ndemonstrates the removal of unwanted transverse multipoles to create a\\nmultipole-free accelerating structure with a single-port coupler, whereas the\\nsecond illustrates the synthesis of desired multipoles to create an RF cavity\\nthat transforms the transverse distribution of a beam from Gaussian to uniform.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.acc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.acc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T09:25:35Z\"}"}
