However, in nonlinear\\nmulti-photon regimes, these classical mechanisms break down, revealing new\\npossibilities for light emission. Here, we report the discovery of a novel\\nmechanism, termed triggered emission, in which an emitter, largely detuned from\\nsingle-photon states, is triggered by the quantum state of the environment to\\nemit a highly correlated photon pair, doublon. By identifying two critical\\nconditions, energy matching and wavefunction overlap, we demonstrate that the\\ndynamics of the emitter are profoundly shaped by the environment's quantum\\nstate. Using this framework, we construct a novel superposition state\\ncomprising a localized single-photon state and a propagating, strongly\\ncorrelated two-photon wavepacket. Furthermore, we realize the multi-photon\\nunidirectional emission by modulating the emitter and the photon state. Our\\nfindings not only deepen the understanding of nonlinear emitter dynamics but\\nalso provide a versatile platform for quantum computing and quantum information\\nprocessing.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:40:58Z\"}"}
