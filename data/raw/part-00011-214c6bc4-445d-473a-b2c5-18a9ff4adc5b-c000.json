In the presence of global geomagnetic fields, the\\naxions with masses ranging from $10^{-15}\\\\,{\\\\rm eV}-10^{-13}\\\\,{\\\\rm eV}$ induce\\nelectromagnetic waves in the (sub-) extremely low-frequency band ($0.3-30\\\\,{\\\\rm\\nHz}$) through the axion-photon coupling. We predict the amplitude of induced\\nmagnetic fields in the Earth-ionosphere cavity, taking the finite conductivity\\nof the atmosphere into account. This allows us to constrain the axion-photon\\ncoupling parameter, $g_{\\\\rm a\\\\gamma}$, from the long-term monitoring data of\\nthe low-frequency magnetic fields, resulting in a significant improvement from\\nthe previous constraints down to $g_{\\\\rm a\\\\gamma} \\\\lesssim\\n4\\\\times10^{-13}\\\\,{\\\\rm GeV}^{-1}$ for axion mass $\\\\sim 3 \\\\times 10^{-14}\\\\,{\\\\rm\\neV}$.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T07:42:28Z\"}"}
