{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20394v1\", \"title\": \"The Problem of No Return Photon Ranging Measurements with Entangled\\n  Photons\", \"summary\": \"We introduce a fascinating problem of light detection and ranging measurement\\nwithout necessitating the return of the photon directed towards the target or\\nobject. We approach this challenging problem using quantum entanglement - an\\nentangled pair of photons; one photon is sent toward the target or object,\\nwhile the other is directed into a medium, which undergoes continuous\\nmeasurements. We assume the light-matter interaction at the target such that\\nthe quantum state collapse is probabilistically biased. We present thought\\nexperiments and measurement schemes to conduct correlation measurements and\\nexamine the methodology of these measurements to estimate the target's range,\\nusing a maximally entangled Bell state ($|\\\\Psi^+\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\n(|H_1V_2\\\\rangle + |V_1H_2\\\\rangle)$) as an example. When the photon interacts\\nwith the target, the Bell state undergoes biased decoherence or state collapse,\\nleaving a signature in the spatial correlation G(x) quantity.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T03:35:20Z\"}"}
