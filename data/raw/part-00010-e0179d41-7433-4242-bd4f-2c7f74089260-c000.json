High-Frequency Evidence on Minimum Wage Effects and\\n  Amenity Pass-Through in Spot Labor Markets\", \"summary\": \"This paper provides causal evidence on the short-run effects of minimum wage\\nhikes in a spot labor market using confidential contract-level data from a\\nJapanese job-matching platform. Leveraging high-frequency variation and a\\nbin-level difference-in-differences design, we find a 2 percentage point\\ndecline in employment within affected wage bins, with losses concentrated below\\nthe new threshold. Transportation reimbursement-a flexible nonwage amenity\\n-remains largely unchanged, indicating limited pass-through. These findings\\nsuggest that spot labor markets adjust rapidly through wage compliance, with\\nthe cost burden borne by establishments rather than offset through reductions\\nin job amenities.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T16:41:23Z\"}"}
