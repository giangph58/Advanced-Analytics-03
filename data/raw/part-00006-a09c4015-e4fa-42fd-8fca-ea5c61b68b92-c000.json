{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03184v1\", \"title\": \"Interactive Instance Annotation with Siamese Networks\", \"summary\": \"Annotating instance masks is time-consuming and labor-intensive. A promising\\nsolution is to predict contours using a deep learning model and then allow\\nusers to refine them. However, most existing methods focus on in-domain\\nscenarios, limiting their effectiveness for cross-domain annotation tasks. In\\nthis paper, we propose SiamAnno, a framework inspired by the use of Siamese\\nnetworks in object tracking. SiamAnno leverages one-shot learning to annotate\\npreviously unseen objects by taking a bounding box as input and predicting\\nobject boundaries, which can then be adjusted by annotators. Trained on one\\ndataset and tested on another without fine-tuning, SiamAnno achieves\\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple datasets, demonstrating its\\nability to handle domain and environment shifts in cross-domain tasks. We also\\nprovide more comprehensive results compared to previous work, establishing a\\nstrong baseline for future research. To our knowledge, SiamAnno is the first\\nmodel to explore Siamese architecture for instance annotation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T05:04:56Z\"}"}
