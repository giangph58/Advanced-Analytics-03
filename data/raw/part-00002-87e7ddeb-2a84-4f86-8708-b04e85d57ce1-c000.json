However, the effectiveness of\\nthese explanations depends on their actionability --their ability to empower\\nusers to make informed decisions and mitigate misinformation. Despite\\nactionability being a critical property of high-quality explanations, no prior\\nresearch has proposed a dedicated method to evaluate it. This paper introduces\\nFinGrAct, a fine-grained evaluation framework that can access the web, and it\\nis designed to assess actionability in AFC explanations through well-defined\\ncriteria and an evaluation dataset. FinGrAct surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA)\\nevaluators, achieving the highest Pearson and Kendall correlation with human\\njudgments while demonstrating the lowest ego-centric bias, making it a more\\nrobust evaluation approach for actionability evaluation in AFC.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T16:14:27Z\"}"}
