We propose a physical\\nrealization of the exact state-specific Petz map in an ion trap for qubit\\ndecoherence channels. Our circuit constructions require at most $1 (2)$ ancilla\\nqubits and $3 (20)$ CNOT gates for channels with Kraus rank $2 (>2)$. We\\nanalyze typical ion trap errors and construct corresponding Petz maps,\\nsimulating their performance under realistic noise modeled by residual\\nspin-motion coupling. Quantum circuits are provided for depolarizing,\\ndephasing, and amplitude damping channels. Focusing on single-shot recovery,\\nsuited for present-day devices, we also quantify the precision of prior\\nknowledge required to achieve a recovery error below 0.01 across varying\\ndecoherence levels and state purities.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T03:45:56Z\"}"}
