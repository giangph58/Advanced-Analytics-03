{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03502v1\", \"title\": \"Nuclear structure and weak rates of heavy waiting point nuclei under\\n  rp-process conditions\", \"summary\": \"The structure and the weak interaction mediated rates of the heavy waiting\\npoint (WP) nuclei $^{80}$Zr, $^{84}$Mo, $^{88}$Ru, $^{92}$Pd and $^{96}$Cd\\nalong $N = Z$ line were studied within the interacting boson model-1\\n(\\\\mbox{IBM-1}) and the proton-neutron quasi-particle random phase approximation\\n(\\\\mbox{pn-QRPA}). The energy levels of the $N$ = $Z$ WP nuclei were calculated\\nby fitting the essential parameters of \\\\mbox{IBM-1} Hamiltonian and their\\ngeometric shapes were predicted by plotting potential energy surfaces (PESs).\\nHalf-lives, continuum electron capture rates, positron decay rates, electron\\ncapture cross sections of WP nuclei, energy rates of $\\\\beta$-delayed protons\\nand their emission probabilities were later calculated using the\\n\\\\mbox{pn-QRPA}. The calculated Gamow-Teller strength distributions were\\ncompared with previous calculation. We present positron decay $\\\\&$ continuum\\nelectron capture rates on these WP nuclei under $rp$-process conditions using\\nthe same model. For the $rp$-process conditions, the calculated total weak\\nrates are twice the Skyrme HF+BCS+QRPA rates for $^{80}$Zr. For remaining\\nnuclei the two calculations compare well. The electron capture rates are\\nsignificant and compete well with the corresponding positron decay rates under\\n$rp$-process conditions. The finding of the present study supports that\\nelectron capture rates form an integral part of the weak rates under\\n$rp$-process conditions and has an important role for the nuclear model\\ncalculations.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T13:09:46Z\"}"}
