In this short note we discuss the consequences of one solution to\\nthis tension, a small but negative spatial curvature with $R_k = 21 H_0^{-1}$,\\nwhich DESI measures at $2\\\\sigma$. We describe the physical role of curvature in\\ncosmological distance measures tied to recombination, i.e. the CMB and BAO, and\\nthe relation to neutrino mass constraints which are relaxed to $\\\\sum m_\\\\nu <\\n0.10$ eV when curvature is allowed to deviate from zero. A robust detection of\\nnegative curvature would have significant implications for inflationary models:\\nimproved BAO measurements, particularly from future high-redshift spectroscopic\\nsurveys, will be able to distinguish curvature from other solutions to the\\nDESI-CMB tension like phantom dark energy at high significance.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T17:01:10Z\"}"}
