To simulate the in-medium modifications of\\nthe constituent quark masses, we employ the chiral SU(3) quark mean field\\nmodel. Our analysis focuses on evaluating the effective masses, weak decay\\nconstants, and distribution amplitudes (DAs) of $B$ mesons in\\nisospin-asymmetric nuclear matter. The calculated vacuum values of the $B$\\nmeson masses and decay constants show good agreement with existing experimental\\ndata, validating our approach to study the medium effects within the same\\nframework.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T07:48:32Z\"}"}
