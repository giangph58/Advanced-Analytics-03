The synthesis was based on the reduction of gold\\nonto the different types of nanodiamond (annealed or annealed and oxidized, 50\\nor 230 nm) using root extracts of Nympheaea alba as a reducing agent. These\\ngold-coated nanodiamonds were characterized by UV-Vis, PXRD, DLS,\\nzeta-potential, PIXE, Raman, SEM, and TEM, assessing particle size, stability,\\nand gold coating effectiveness. Cellular studies in the A549 and Panc1 cancer\\ncell lines assessed uptake, cytotoxicity, and colony formation to evaluate\\nNDAu's biological activity. NDAu demonstrated strong cellular uptake and\\ncytotoxic effects in A549 and Panc1 cell lines, reducing cell survival in\\nclonogenic assay. Futher research in the capabilites of these nanoparticles for\\nproton therapy will be performed.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T10:49:51Z\"}"}
