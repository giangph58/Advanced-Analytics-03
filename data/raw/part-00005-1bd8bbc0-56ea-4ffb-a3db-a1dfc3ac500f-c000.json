{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04094v1\", \"title\": \"SolPhishHunter: Towards Detecting and Understanding Phishing on Solana\", \"summary\": \"Solana is a rapidly evolving blockchain platform that has attracted an\\nincreasing number of users. However, this growth has also drawn the attention\\nof malicious actors, with some phishers extending their reach into the Solana\\necosystem. Unlike platforms such as Ethereum, Solana has distinct designs of\\naccounts and transactions, leading to the emergence of new types of phishing\\ntransactions that we term SolPhish. We define three types of SolPhish and\\ndevelop a detection tool called SolPhishHunter. Utilizing SolPhishHunter, we\\ndetect a total of 8,058 instances of SolPhish and conduct an empirical analysis\\nof these detected cases. Our analysis explores the distribution and impact of\\nSolPhish, the characteristics of the phishers, and the relationships among\\nphishing gangs. Particularly, the detected SolPhish transactions have resulted\\nin nearly \\\\$1.1 million in losses for victims. We report our detection results\\nto the community and construct SolPhishDataset, the \\\\emph{first} Solana\\nphishing-related dataset in academia.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T03:16:58Z\"}"}
