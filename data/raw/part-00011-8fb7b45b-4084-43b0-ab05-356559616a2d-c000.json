Accurate studies of the $Z$-boson\\ncouplings to the first-generation quarks, which are currently constrained from\\nLEP data to a few percent, could reveal potential discrepancies from the theory\\npredictions. Future $e^+e^-$ colliders running at the $Z$-pole would be an\\nexcellent tool for an analysis based on a comparison of radiative and\\nnon-radiative $Z$ boson decays. In this paper, we present a method to extract\\nthe values of the $Z$ couplings to light quarks and discuss the uncertainty of\\nthe measurement, including contributions from various systematic effects. We\\nshow that systematic uncertainty in the heavy-flavour tagging performance is\\nthe key factor in the analysis and reducing it to a sub-permille level might be\\ncrucial to fully profit from the high luminosity of future $e^+e^-$ machines.\\nThe measurement could improve the LEP results by at least an order of\\nmagnitude.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:31:21Z\"}"}
