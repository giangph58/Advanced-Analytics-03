The collection of all\\nmeasurable $\\\\Gamma$-equivariant quotients, known as $\\\\mu$-boundaries, of the\\nPoisson boundary forms a partially ordered set, equipped with a strictly\\nmonotonic non-negative function, known as Furstenberg or differential entropy.\\n  In this paper we demonstrate the richness and the complexity of this lattice\\nof quotients for the case of free groups and surface groups and rather general\\nmeasures. In particular, we show that there are continuum many unrelated\\n$\\\\mu$-boundaries at each, sufficiently low, entropy level, and there are\\ncontinuum many distinct order-theoretic cubes of $\\\\mu$-boundaries.\\n  These $\\\\mu$-boundaries are constructed from dense linear representations\\n$\\\\rho:\\\\Gamma\\\\to G$ to semi-simple Lie groups, like $\\\\PSL_2(\\\\bbC)^d$ with\\nabsolutely continuous stationary measures on $\\\\hat\\\\bbC^d$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GR\", \"categories\": \"math.GR,math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T06:35:18Z\"}"}
