To bridge this gap, we propose OpDiffer, a\\ndifferential testing framework for EVM, which takes advantage of LLMs and\\nstatic analysis methods to address the above two limitations. We conducted the\\nlargest-scale evaluation, covering nine EVMs and uncovering 26 previously\\nunknown bugs, 22 of which have been confirmed by developers and three have been\\nassigned CNVD IDs. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, OpDiffer can improve\\ncode coverage by at most 71.06%, 148.40% and 655.56%, respectively. Through an\\nanalysis of real-world deployed Ethereum contracts, we estimate that 7.21% of\\nthe contracts could trigger our identified EVM bugs under certain environmental\\nsettings, potentially resulting in severe negative impact on the Ethereum\\necosystem.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE,cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T12:48:00Z\"}"}
