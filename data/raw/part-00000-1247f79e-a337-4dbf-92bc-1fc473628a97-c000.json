Fitting-free groups), a class for\\nwhich isomorphism testing was previously known to be in $\\\\mathsf{P}$ (Babai,\\nCodenotti, and Qiao; ICALP '12). Here, we leverage the fact that\\n$G/\\\\text{PKer}(G)$ can be viewed as permutation group of degree $O(\\\\log |G|)$.\\nAs $G$ is given by its multiplication table, we are able to implement the\\nsolution for the corresponding instance of Twisted Code Equivalence in\\n$\\\\textsf{AC}^{3}$.\\n  In sharp contrast, we show that when our groups are specified by a generating\\nset of permutations, isomorphism testing of Fitting-free groups is at least as\\nhard as Graph Isomorphism and Linear Code Equivalence (the latter being\\n$\\\\textsf{GI}$-hard and having no known subexponential-time algorithm).\\n  Lastly, we show that any Fitting-free group of order $n$ is identified by\\n$\\\\textsf{FO}$ formulas (without counting) using only $O(\\\\log \\\\log n)$\\nvariables. This is in contrast to the fact that there are infinite families of\\nAbelian groups that are not identified by $\\\\textsf{FO}$ formulas with $o(\\\\log\\nn)$ variables (Grochow & Levet, FCT '23).\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CC\", \"categories\": \"cs.CC,cs.DS,cs.LO,math.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T13:23:46Z\"}"}
