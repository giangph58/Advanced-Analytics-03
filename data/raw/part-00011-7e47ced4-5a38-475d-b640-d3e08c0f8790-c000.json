Due to the\\nheterogeneity and nonlocality, the linear Fourier analysis gives rise to\\n\\\\textit{strongly coupled} infinite differential systems. By introducing\\nsuitable changes of basis as well as the Gershgorin disks theorem for infinite\\nmatrices, we first show that all $N$-th Gershgorin disks lie completely on the\\nleft half-plane for sufficiently large $N$. For the remaining finitely many\\ndisks, a computer-assisted proof shows that if the intensity $\\\\delta$ of the\\nnonlocal term is large enough, there is precisely one eigenvalue with positive\\nreal part, which proves the Turing instability. Moreover, by detailed study of\\nthis eigenvalue as a function of $\\\\delta$, we obtain a sharp threshold\\n$\\\\delta^*$ which is the bifurcation point for Turing instability.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,cs.NA,math.DS,math.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:34:46Z\"}"}
