Our problem: we need a full semantic lexical database SLD in an\\noral (voice) and writing way to help stakeholders to create ideas, these ideas\\ncontain nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives in the English, Spanish, and French\\nlanguages. We utilize a Cloud Service Provider to use a service of Artificial\\nIntelligence (AI), also we prepare nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs files\\nin order to create the service text to voice and create our SLD with voice.\\nThis paper presents, first, an introduction about some contests that use a\\nsemantic lexical database in different languages; second, a SLD management\\napproach using analysis of texts; third, a management application approach to\\ncomplete all the new elements; fourth, the results of the management\\napplication approach, finally the conclusions and future work.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:54:06Z\"}"}
