{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04610v1\", \"title\": \"Early and Extensive Ultraviolet Through Near Infrared Observations of\\n  the Intermediate-Luminosity Type Iax Supernovae 2024pxl\", \"summary\": \"We present ultraviolet (UV) through near-infrared (NIR) photometric and\\nspectroscopic observations of the nearby SN 2024pxl, the third Type Ia\\nsupernova (SN Ia) in NGC 6384. SN 2024pxl is a Type Iax supernova (SN Iax) with\\nan intermediate luminosity ($M_r = -16.99\\\\pm0.32$ mag) and an average SN Iax\\nlight curve decline rate. SN 2024pxl was discovered $\\\\sim$3 days after first\\nlight, and the rising light curve follows a single power law that is\\ninconsistent with significant interaction with a companion star or\\ncircumstellar material. Our extensive NIR photometric coverage is comparable to\\nthat of the well-observed SNe Iax 2005hk and 2012Z, and we demonstrate that the\\n$J-H$ colors of SNe Iax differ from normal SNe Ia and appear to be more\\nhomogeneous as a class. Spectroscopically, we report the earliest-ever NIR\\nspectrum of a SN Iax as measured from maximum light ($t\\\\approx-9$ days): a\\nfeatureless continuum with similarities to a $\\\\sim$9,000 K blackbody, and the\\nline velocities are consistent with a mixed-ejecta structure, with C, Si, and\\nFe having similar velocities and velocity evolutions. We find a tentative\\ncorrelation between the $H$-band break Co II velocity $\\\\sim$20 days post-peak\\nand absolute magnitude, with more luminous SNe Iax showing faster Co II\\nvelocities. Our observations suggest that SN 2024pxl resulted from the\\nthermonuclear disruption of a CO white dwarf star that undergoes deflagration\\nburning.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T17:55:15Z\"}"}
