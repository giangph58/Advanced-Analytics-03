We observe a significant anisotropic anomalous Hall\\neffect (AHE) due to nonzero Berry curvature in the momentum space, such that\\nthe anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) is 965 S/cm for the $xy$-plane and 233\\nS/cm for the $zx$-plane of the single crystal. The band structure calculations\\npredict several Weyl and nodal points span across the momentum space, gapped\\nout under the spin-orbit coupling effect, leading to significant $k$-space\\nBerry curvature and large AHC. Experimentally, we also demonstrate a sizeable\\ntopological Hall effect that is originated by the non-coplanar chiral spin\\nstructure due to the competition between the out-of-plane uniaxial\\nmagnetocrystalline anisotropy and the dipole-dipole interaction between two Mn\\nsublattices. This study hints at the importance of dipole-dipole interactions\\nin producing the skyrmion lattice in Mn$_5$Ge$_3$.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T16:44:26Z\"}"}
