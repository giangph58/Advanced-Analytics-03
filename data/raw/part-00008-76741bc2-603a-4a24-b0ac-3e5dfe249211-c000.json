For a collection of KR-modules with nested supports, we show an\\nexplicit construction of a cluster seed, which has cluster variables\\ncorresponding to the $q$-characters of KR-modules of such a collection. We\\nprove that the product of KR-modules of such a collection is a simple module.\\nWe also construct cluster seeds with cluster variables corresponding to\\n$q$-characters of KR-modules of some non-nested collections. We make a\\nconjecture that tensor products of KR-modules for such non-nested collections\\nare simple. We show that the cluster Donaldson-Thomas transformations for\\ndouble Bruhat cells for $ADE$ types can be computed using $q$-characters of\\nKR-modules.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RT\", \"categories\": \"math.RT,math.QA\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T08:28:36Z\"}"}
