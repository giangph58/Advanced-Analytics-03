While structural neuroimaging biomarkers have\\nprogressed significantly, objective functional biomarkers of early cognitive\\ndecline remain a critical unmet need. Current cognitive assessments often rely\\non behavioral responses, making them susceptible to factors like effort,\\npractice effects, and educational background, thereby hindering early and\\naccurate detection. This work introduces a novel approach, leveraging a\\nlightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) to infer cognitive impairment\\nlevels directly from electroencephalography (EEG) data. Critically, this method\\nemploys a passive fast periodic visual stimulation (FPVS) paradigm, eliminating\\nthe need for explicit behavioral responses or task comprehension from the\\nparticipant. This passive approach provides an objective measure of working\\nmemory function, independent of confounding factors inherent in active\\ncognitive tasks, and offers a promising new avenue for early and unbiased\\ndetection of cognitive decline.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.NC\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.NC,cs.HC,cs.LG,J.3\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T08:34:13Z\"}"}
