{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15214v1\", \"title\": \"Histogram-based Parameter-efficient Tuning for Passive Sonar\\n  Classification\", \"summary\": \"Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) methods adapt large artificial\\nneural networks to downstream tasks without fine-tuning the entire model.\\nHowever, existing additive methods, such as adapters, sometimes struggle to\\ncapture distributional shifts in intermediate feature embeddings. We propose a\\nnovel histogram-based parameter-efficient tuning (HPT) technique that captures\\nthe statistics of the target domain and modulates the embeddings. Experimental\\nresults on three downstream passive sonar datasets (ShipsEar, DeepShip, VTUAD)\\ndemonstrate that HPT outperforms conventional adapters. Notably, HPT achieves\\n91.8% vs. 89.8% accuracy on VTUAD. Furthermore, HPT trains faster and yields\\nfeature representations closer to those of fully fine-tuned models. Overall,\\nHPT balances parameter savings and performance, providing a distribution-aware\\nalternative to existing adapters and shows a promising direction for scalable\\ntransfer learning in resource-constrained environments.
