{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20588v1\", \"title\": \"Bootstrap Prediction and Confidence Bands for Frequency Response\\n  Functions in Posturography\", \"summary\": \"The frequency response function (FRF) is an established way to describe the\\noutcome of experiments in posture control literature. The FRF is an empirical\\ntransfer function between an input stimulus and the induced body segment sway\\nprofile, represented as a vector of complex values associated with a vector of\\nfrequencies. For this reason, testing the components of the FRF independently\\nwith Bonferroni correction can result in a too-conservative approach.\\nPerforming statistics on scalar values defined on the FRF, e.g., comparing the\\naverages, implies an arbitrary decision by the experimenter. This work proposes\\nbootstrap prediction and confidence bands as general methods to evaluate the\\noutcome of posture control experiments, overcoming the foretold limitations of\\npreviously used approaches.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP,q-bio.NC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T09:40:49Z\"}"}
