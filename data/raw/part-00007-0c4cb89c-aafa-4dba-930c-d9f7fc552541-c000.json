{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04934v1\", \"title\": \"Enhancing Blockchain Cross Chain Interoperability: A Comprehensive\\n  Survey\", \"summary\": \"Blockchain technology, introduced in 2008, has revolutionized data storage\\nand transfer across sectors such as finance, healthcare, intelligent\\ntransportation, and the metaverse. However, the proliferation of blockchain\\nsystems has led to discrepancies in architectures, consensus mechanisms, and\\ndata standards, creating data and value silos that hinder the development of an\\nintegrated multi chain ecosystem. Blockchain interoperability (a.k.a cross\\nchain interoperability) has thus emerged as a solution to enable seamless data\\nand asset exchange across disparate blockchains. In this survey, we\\nsystematically analyze over 150 high impact sources from academic journals,\\ndigital libraries, and grey literature to provide an in depth examination of\\nblockchain interoperability. By exploring the existing methods, technologies,\\nand architectures, we offer a classification of interoperability approaches\\nincluding Atomic Swaps, Sidechains, Light Clients, and so on, which represent\\nthe most comprehensive overview to date. Furthermore, we investigate the\\nconvergence of academic research with industry practices, underscoring the\\nimportance of collaborative efforts in advancing blockchain innovation.\\nFinally, we identify key strategic insights, challenges, and future research\\ntrajectories in this field. Our findings aim to support researchers,\\npolicymakers, and industry leaders in understanding and harnessing the\\ntransformative potential of blockchain interoperability to address current\\nchallenges and drive forward a cohesive multi-chain ecosystem.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T04:24:50Z\"}"}
