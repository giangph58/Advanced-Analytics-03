An innovative method is proposed to identify and rank\\nfolding sequences, enabling the transformation of a box from an initial state\\nto a desired final configuration. The system evaluates and ranks these\\nsequences based on their feasibility and compatibility with available hardware,\\nproviding recommendations for real-world implementations. Finally, an\\nillustrative use case is presented, where a robot performs the folding of a\\nbox.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T09:02:09Z\"}"}
