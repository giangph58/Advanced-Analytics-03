{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03365v1\", \"title\": \"Surface Grafting of Graphene Flakes with Fluorescent Dyes: A Tailored\\n  Functionalization Approach\", \"summary\": \"The controlled functionalization of graphene is critical for tuning and\\nenhancing its properties, thereby expanding its potential applications.\\nCovalent functionalization offers a deeper tuning of the geometric and\\nelectronic structure of graphene compared to non-covalent methods; however, the\\nexisting techniques involve side reactions and spatially uncontrolled\\nfunctionalization, pushing research toward more selective and controlled\\nmethods. A promising approach is 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, successfully\\nutilized with carbon nanotubes. In the present work, this method has been\\nextended to graphene flakes with low defect concentration. A key innovation is\\nthe use of a custom-synthesized ylide with a protected amine group (Boc),\\nfacilitating subsequent attachment of functional molecules. Indeed, after Boc\\ncleavage, fluorescent dyes (Atto 425, 465, and 633) were covalently linked via\\nNHS ester derivatization. This approach represents a highly selective method of\\nminimizing structural damage. Successful functionalization was demonstrated by\\nRaman spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, and confocal microscopy,\\nconfirming the effectiveness of the method. This novel approach offers a\\nversatile platform, enabling its use in biological imaging, sensing, and\\nadvanced nanodevices. The method paves the way for the development of sensors\\nand devices capable of anchoring a wide range of molecules, including quantum\\ndots and nanoparticles. Therefore, it represents a significant advancement in\\ngraphene-based technologies.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T09:38:32Z\"}"}
