Most work on the dueling bandit has targeted\\ntransitive relations, that is, totally/partially ordered sets, or assumed at\\nleast the existence of a champion such as Condorcet winner and Copeland winner.\\nThis work develops an analysis of dueling bandits for non-transitive relations.\\nJan-ken (a.k.a. rock-paper-scissors) is a typical example of a non-transitive\\nrelation. It is known that a rational player chooses one of three items\\nuniformly at random, which is known to be Nash equilibrium in game theory.\\nInterestingly, any variant of Jan-ken with four items (e.g., rock, paper,\\nscissors, and well) contains at least one useless item, which is never selected\\nby a rational player. This work investigates a dueling bandit problem to\\nidentify whether all $n$ items are indispensable in a given win-lose relation.\\nThen, we provide upper and lower bounds of the sample complexity of the\\nidentification problem in terms of the determinant of $A$ and a solution of\\n$\\\\mathbf{x}^{\\\\top} A = \\\\mathbf{0}^{\\\\top}$ where $A$ is an $n \\\\times n$ pay-off\\nmatrix that every duel follows.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GT\", \"categories\": \"cs.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T07:40:04Z\"}"}
