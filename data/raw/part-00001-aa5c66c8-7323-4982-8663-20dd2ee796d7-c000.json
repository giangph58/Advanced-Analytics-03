Worst-case\\nprediction failures can have substantial consequences, but current frameworks\\nlack statistical foundations for assessing their probability. In this work a\\nnew statistical framework, based on Extreme Value Theory (EVT), is presented\\nthat provides a rigorous approach to estimating worst-case failures. Applying\\nEVT to synthetic and real-world datasets, this method is shown to enable robust\\nestimation of catastrophic failure probabilities, overcoming the fundamental\\nlimitations of standard cross-validation. This work establishes EVT as a\\nfundamental tool for assessing model reliability, ensuring safer AI deployment\\nin new technologies where uncertainty quantification is central to\\ndecision-making or scientific analysis.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,stat.ME,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:08:11Z\"}"}
