Specifically, for any $\\\\varepsilon > 0$ and sufficiently large $d$,\\nwe give an explicit construction of an infinite family of $d$-regular graphs\\nwhere every small set $S$ of vertices has $(1-\\\\varepsilon)d|S|$ neighbors\\n(which implies $(1-2\\\\varepsilon)d|S|$ unique-neighbors). Our results also\\nextend naturally to construct biregular bipartite graphs of any constant\\nimbalance, where small sets on each side have strong expansion guarantees. The\\ngraphs we construct admit a free group action, and hence realize new families\\nof quantum LDPC codes of Lin and M.
