Recent Photometric Evolution\\n  and Comparison with Past Pre-Outburst Behaviour\", \"summary\": \"T CrB is a symbiotic recurrent nova that last erupted in 1946. Given its\\nrecurrence timescale of approximately 80 years, the next outburst is eagerly\\nanticipated by the astronomical community. In this work, we analyse the optical\\nlight curves of T CrB, comparing recent photometric evolution with historical\\ndata to evaluate potential predictive indicators of nova eruptions. Although\\nthe \\\"super-active\\\" phases preceding both the 1946 and anticipated eruptions are\\nstrikingly similar, the subsequent photometric behaviour differs. We find that\\nthe decline in brightness observed in 2023, interpreted by some as a\\n\\\"pre-eruption dip\\\", deviates from the deep minimum recorded prior to the 1946\\nevent and does not reliably predict the eruption timing. Recent photometric and\\nspectroscopic observations indicate that the system is returning to a\\nhigh-accretion state. Given this, an eruption may be imminent, even without\\ndistinct precursors. While the next eruption of T CrB will be a major\\nscientific event, its expected peak brightness of $V \\\\sim 2$ mag highlights the\\nimportance of setting realistic public expectations for what will be a visually\\nmodest, yet astrophysically very significant, celestial event.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T09:45:34Z\"}"}
