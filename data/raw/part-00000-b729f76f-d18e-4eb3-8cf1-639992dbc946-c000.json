The key advantage of derivative sampling is its\\nability to reduce the sampling rate. We derive a sampling formula based on\\nperiodic nonuniform sampling (PNS) sets with derivatives in a shift-invariant\\nspace. We establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for such a set to\\nform a complete interpolating sequence (CIS) of order $r-1$. This framework is\\nthen used to develop an efficient approximation scheme in a shift-invariant\\nspace generated by a compactly supported function. Building on this, we propose\\na prediction algorithm that reconstructs a signal from a finite number of past\\nderivative samples using the derived perfect reconstruction formula. Finally,\\nwe validate our theoretical results through practical examples involving cubic\\nsplines and the Daubechies scaling function of order 3.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T12:23:07Z\"}"}
