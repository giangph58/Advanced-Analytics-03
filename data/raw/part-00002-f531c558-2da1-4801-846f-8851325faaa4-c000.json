Our result is\\nthe following universal threshold for the embeddability of trees. Let $\\\\Delta\\n\\\\geqslant 3$, and let $N$ be sufficiently large in terms of $\\\\Delta$. Every\\n$N$--vertex tree of maximal degree at most $\\\\Delta$ is embeddable into any\\nnormed space of dimension at least $64\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\log N}{\\\\log\\\\log N}$, and\\ncomplete trees are non-embeddable into any normed space of dimension less than\\n$\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\log N}{\\\\log\\\\log N}$. In striking contrast, spectral\\nexpanders and random graphs are known to be non-embeddable in sublogarithmic\\ndimension. Our result is based on a randomized embedding whose analysis\\nutilizes the recent breakthroughs on Bourgain's slicing problem.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,math.FA,math.MG,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T16:33:18Z\"}"}
