The possibilities of injecting 100%\\nspin-polarised electron into MoS2 using half metallic NiMnSb as an electrode,\\nthe layer dependent, and the effect of the type of interface on electronic\\nstructure and spin-transport properties in magnetic tunnel junction devices are\\nstudied. We show that the half-metallicity of NiMnSb(111) is preserved at the\\ninterface between the half-Heusler alloy NiMnSb and MoS2. NiMnSb keeps a fully\\nspin-polarised state in the majority spin channel at the interface between\\nNiMnSb and MoS2, injecting fully spin-polarised electrons into the\\nsemiconductor. The device based on NiMnSb/MoS2(single layer)/NiMnSb has a\\nmetallic interface. Metal-induced states in the spin-majority channel of MoS2\\nare seen after making an interface with half metallic NiMnSb. In contrast, the\\nNiMnSb/MoS2(three layers)/NiMnSb interface with a multilayer of MoS2 has a band\\ngap region, and electrons can tunnel through the junction. The Mn-S interface\\nis more conducting than the Sb-S interface due to the strong bonding of Mn and\\nS atoms at the Mn-S interface.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T06:13:33Z\"}"}
