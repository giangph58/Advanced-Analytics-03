Here, we demonstrate that pressure can\\nefficiently tune the flatness and quantum geometry of the single-particle bands\\nin twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ ($\\\\textit{t}$MoTe$_2$). By fractionally filling the\\ntopmost valence band, we find that pressure can act as a flexible means to\\nmodulate the fractional Chern insulator (FCI) and the generalized Wigner\\ncrystal (GWC) and control their many-body topological phase transitions.\\nMoreover, our results indicate a remarkable correspondence between the\\nsingle-particle band geometry and the formation of FCI and GWC. As the recent\\nexperiments report the presence of FCI phases in $\\\\textit{t}$MoTe$_2$, our\\npredictions could be readily implemented experimentally.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T13:32:42Z\"}"}
