However, effective signal processing over layered networks requires\\ntopological descriptors of the intra- and cross-layers relationships that are\\nable to disentangle the homologies of different domains, at different scales,\\naccording to the specific learning task. In this paper, we present Cell\\nMultiComplex (CMC) spaces, which are novel topological domains for representing\\nmultiple higher-order relationships among interconnected complexes. We\\nintroduce cross-Laplacians matrices, which are algebraic descriptors of CMCs\\nenabling the extraction of topological invariants at different scales, whether\\nglobal or local, inter-layer or intra-layer. Using the eigenvectors of these\\ncross-Laplacians as signal bases, we develop topological signal processing\\ntools for CMC spaces. In this first study, we focus on the representation and\\nfiltering of noisy flows observed over cross-edges between different layers of\\nCMCs to identify cross-layer hubs, i.e., key nodes on one layer controlling the\\nothers.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T11:42:58Z\"}"}
