{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01806v1\", \"title\": \"Quattro: Transformer-Accelerated Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator\\n  Framework for Fast Trajectory Optimization\", \"summary\": \"Real-time optimal control remains a fundamental challenge in robotics,\\nespecially for nonlinear systems with stringent performance requirements. As\\none of the representative trajectory optimization algorithms, the iterative\\nLinear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) faces limitations due to their inherently\\nsequential computational nature, which restricts the efficiency and\\napplicability of real-time control for robotic systems. While existing parallel\\nimplementations aim to overcome the above limitations, they typically demand\\nadditional computational iterations and high-performance hardware, leading to\\nonly modest practical improvements. In this paper, we introduce Quattro, a\\ntransformer-accelerated iLQR framework employing an algorithm-hardware\\nco-design strategy to predict intermediate feedback and feedforward matrices.\\nIt facilitates effective parallel computations on resource-constrained devices\\nwithout sacrificing accuracy. Experiments on cart-pole and quadrotor systems\\nshow an algorithm-level acceleration of up to 5.3$\\\\times$ and 27$\\\\times$ per\\niteration, respectively. When integrated into a Model Predictive Control (MPC)\\nframework, Quattro achieves overall speedups of 2.8$\\\\times$ for the cart-pole\\nand 17.8$\\\\times$ for the quadrotor compared to the one that applies traditional\\niLQR. Transformer inference is deployed on FPGA to maximize performance,\\nachieving up to 27.3$\\\\times$ speedup over commonly used computing devices, with\\naround 2 to 4$\\\\times$ power reduction and acceptable hardware overhead.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.RO,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:12:18Z\"}"}
