One method\\ngovernments can employ to control these emissions is to provide firms with\\nemission limits and penalize any excess emissions above the limit. Excess\\nemissions may also be offset by firms who choose to invest in carbon reducing\\nand capturing projects. These projects generate offset credits which can be\\nsubmitted to a regulating agency to offset a firm's excess emissions, or they\\ncan be traded with other firms. In this work, we characterize the finite-agent\\nNash equilibrium for offset credit markets. As computing Nash equilibria is an\\nNP-hard problem, we utilize the modern reinforcement learning technique\\nNash-DQN to efficiently estimate the market's Nash equilibria. We demonstrate\\nnot only the validity of employing reinforcement learning methods applied to\\nclimate themed financial markets, but also the significant financial savings\\nemitting firms may achieve when abiding by the Nash equilibria through\\nnumerical experiments.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.MF\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.MF,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:56:42Z\"}"}
