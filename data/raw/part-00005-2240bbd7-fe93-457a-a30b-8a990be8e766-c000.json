Although many previous methods\\nattempt to mitigate intra-class variations, they often struggle with instances\\nexhibiting complex geometries or significant deviations from canonical shapes.\\nTo address this challenge, we propose INKL-Pose, a novel category-level object\\npose estimation framework that enables INstance-adaptive Keypoint Learning with\\nlocal-to-global geometric aggregation. Specifically, our approach first\\npredicts semantically consistent and geometric informative keypoints through an\\nInstance-Adaptive Keypoint Generator, then refines them with: (1) a Local\\nKeypoint Feature Aggregator capturing fine-grained geometries, and (2) a Global\\nKeypoint Feature Aggregator using bidirectional Mamba for structural\\nconsistency. To enable bidirectional modeling in Mamba, we introduce a Feature\\nSequence Flipping strategy that preserves spatial coherence while constructing\\nbackward feature sequences. Additionally, we design a surface loss and a\\nseparation loss to enforce uniform coverage and spatial diversity in keypoint\\ndistribution. The generated keypoints are finally mapped to a canonical space\\nfor regressing the object's 6D pose and size. Extensive experiments on\\nCAMERA25, REAL275, and HouseCat6D demonstrate that INKL-Pose achieves\\nstate-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms existing methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T14:37:37Z\"}"}
