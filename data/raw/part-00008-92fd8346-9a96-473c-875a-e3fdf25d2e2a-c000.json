{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11249v1\", \"title\": \"Cryo-em images are intrinsically low dimensional\", \"summary\": \"Simulation-based inference provides a powerful framework for cryo-electron\\nmicroscopy, employing neural networks in methods like CryoSBI to infer\\nbiomolecular conformations via learned latent representations. This latent\\nspace represents a rich opportunity, encoding valuable information about the\\nphysical system and the inference process. Harnessing this potential hinges on\\nunderstanding the underlying geometric structure of these representations. We\\ninvestigate this structure by applying manifold learning techniques to CryoSBI\\nrepresentations of hemagglutinin (simulated and experimental). We reveal that\\nthese high-dimensional data inherently populate low-dimensional, smooth\\nmanifolds, with simulated data effectively covering the experimental\\ncounterpart. By characterizing the manifold's geometry using Diffusion Maps and\\nidentifying its principal axes of variation via coordinate interpretation\\nmethods, we establish a direct link between the latent structure and key\\nphysical parameters. Discovering this intrinsic low-dimensionality and\\ninterpretable geometric organization not only validates the CryoSBI approach\\nbut enables us to learn more from the data structure and provides opportunities\\nfor improving future inference strategies by exploiting this revealed manifold\\ngeometry.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.QM\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.QM,cs.CV,cs.LG,q-bio.BM,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:46:25Z\"}"}
