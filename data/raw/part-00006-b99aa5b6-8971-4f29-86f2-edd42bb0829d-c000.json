The method automatically adapts to the local geometry of\\nthe function and does not use additional expensive computations other than\\ncalculation of the derivative of the Riemannian exponential. We prove the\\nconvergence of the method under the assumption of geodesic completeness. The\\nperformance of the method is illustrated by experiments on the sphere, the\\nmanifold of symmetric positive definite matrices equipped with the\\nBures-Wasserstein metric.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T13:52:24Z\"}"}
