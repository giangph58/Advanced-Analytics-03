{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04507v1\", \"title\": \"Detecting Spelling and Grammatical Anomalies in Russian Poetry Texts\", \"summary\": \"The quality of natural language texts in fine-tuning datasets plays a\\ncritical role in the performance of generative models, particularly in\\ncomputational creativity tasks such as poem or song lyric generation. Fluency\\ndefects in generated poems significantly reduce their value. However, training\\ntexts are often sourced from internet-based platforms without stringent quality\\ncontrol, posing a challenge for data engineers to manage defect levels\\neffectively.\\n  To address this issue, we propose the use of automated linguistic anomaly\\ndetection to identify and filter out low-quality texts from training datasets\\nfor creative models. In this paper, we present a comprehensive comparison of\\nunsupervised and supervised text anomaly detection approaches, utilizing both\\nsynthetic and human-labeled datasets. We also introduce the RUPOR dataset, a\\ncollection of Russian-language human-labeled poems designed for cross-sentence\\ngrammatical error detection, and provide the full evaluation code. Our work\\naims to empower the community with tools and insights to improve the quality of\\ntraining datasets for generative models in creative domains.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T15:27:59Z\"}"}
