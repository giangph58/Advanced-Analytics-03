{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11003v1\", \"title\": \"3D Gabor Splatting: Reconstruction of High-frequency Surface Texture\\n  using Gabor Noise\", \"summary\": \"3D Gaussian splatting has experienced explosive popularity in the past few\\nyears in the field of novel view synthesis. The lightweight and differentiable\\nrepresentation of the radiance field using the Gaussian enables rapid and\\nhigh-quality reconstruction and fast rendering. However, reconstructing objects\\nwith high-frequency surface textures (e.g., fine stripes) requires many skinny\\nGaussian kernels because each Gaussian represents only one color if viewed from\\none direction. Thus, reconstructing the stripes pattern, for example, requires\\nGaussians for at least the number of stripes. We present 3D Gabor splatting,\\nwhich augments the Gaussian kernel to represent spatially high-frequency\\nsignals using Gabor noise. The Gabor kernel is a combination of a Gaussian term\\nand spatially fluctuating wave functions, making it suitable for representing\\nspatial high-frequency texture. We demonstrate that our 3D Gabor splatting can\\nreconstruct various high-frequency textures on the objects.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GR\", \"categories\": \"cs.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T09:20:37Z\"}"}
