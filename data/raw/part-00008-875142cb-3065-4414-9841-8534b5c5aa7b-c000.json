{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12689v1\", \"title\": \"HSS-IAD: A Heterogeneous Same-Sort Industrial Anomaly Detection Dataset\", \"summary\": \"Multi-class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection algorithms (MUAD) are receiving\\nincreasing attention due to their relatively low deployment costs and improved\\ntraining efficiency. However, the real-world effectiveness of MUAD methods is\\nquestioned due to limitations in current Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD)\\ndatasets. These datasets contain numerous classes that are unlikely to be\\nproduced by the same factory and fail to cover multiple structures or\\nappearances. Additionally, the defects do not reflect real-world\\ncharacteristics. Therefore, we introduce the Heterogeneous Same-Sort Industrial\\nAnomaly Detection (HSS-IAD) dataset, which contains 8,580 images of\\nmetallic-like industrial parts and precise anomaly annotations. These parts\\nexhibit variations in structure and appearance, with subtle defects that\\nclosely resemble the base materials. We also provide foreground images for\\nsynthetic anomaly generation. Finally, we evaluate popular IAD methods on this\\ndataset under multi-class and class-separated settings, demonstrating its\\npotential to bridge the gap between existing datasets and real factory\\nconditions. The dataset is available at\\nhttps://github.com/Qiqigeww/HSS-IAD-Dataset.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T06:31:26Z\"}"}
