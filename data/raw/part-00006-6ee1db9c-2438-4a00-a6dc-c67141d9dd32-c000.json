We analyze and numerically compute with two\\nvariational formulations related to dual convex optimization problems\\nconstrained by either the differential-difference equation (DDE) or nonlinear\\nintegral equation (NIE) that wave profiles should satisfy. We prove existence\\ntheorems conditional on the existence of extrema that satisfy a strict\\nconvexity criterion, and numerically exhibit a variety of localized, periodic\\nand non-periodic wave phenomena.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,cs.NA,math.NA,nlin.PS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T15:23:43Z\"}"}
