However, direct communication of\\nthese goals is not always feasible, requiring teammates to infer their\\npartner's intentions through actions. Building on this, we investigate whether\\nan AI agent's ability to share its inferred understanding of a human teammate's\\ngoals can improve task performance and perceived collaboration. Through an\\nexperiment comparing three conditions-no recognition (NR), viable goals (VG),\\nand viable goals on-demand (VGod) - we find that while goal-sharing information\\ndid not yield significant improvements in task performance or overall\\nsatisfaction scores, thematic analysis suggests that it supported strategic\\nadaptations and subjective perceptions of collaboration. Cognitive load\\nassessments revealed no additional burden across conditions, highlighting the\\nchallenge of balancing informativeness and simplicity in human-agent\\ninteractions. These findings highlight the nuanced trade-off of goal-sharing:\\nwhile it fosters trust and enhances perceived collaboration, it can\\noccasionally hinder objective performance gains.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T16:15:24Z\"}"}
