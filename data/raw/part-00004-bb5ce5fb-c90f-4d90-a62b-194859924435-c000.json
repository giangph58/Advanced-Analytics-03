In pursuit of optimal photonic designs,\\nsubstantial progress has been made on two complementary fronts: bottom-up\\nstructural optimizations (inverse design) discover complex high-performing\\nstructures but offer no guarantees of optimality; top-down field optimizations\\n(convex relaxations) reveal fundamental performance limits but offer no\\nguarantees that structures meeting the limits exist. We bridge the gap between\\nthese two parallel paradigms by introducing a ``verlan'' initialization method\\nthat exploits the encoded local and global wave information in duality-based\\nconvex relaxations to guide inverse design towards better-performing\\nstructures. We illustrate this technique via the challenging problem of Purcell\\nenhancement, maximizing the power extracted from a small emitter in the\\nvicinity of a photonic structure, where ill-conditioning and the presence of\\ncompeting local maxima lead to sub-optimal designs for adjoint optimization.\\nStructures discovered by our verlan method outperform standard (random)\\ninitializations by close to an order of magnitude and approach fundamental\\nperformance limits within a factor of two, highlighting the possibility of\\naccessing significant untapped performance improvements.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:53:34Z\"}"}
