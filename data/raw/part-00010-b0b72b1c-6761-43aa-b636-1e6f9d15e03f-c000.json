{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19848v1\", \"title\": \"Human-Centered AI and Autonomy in Robotics: Insights from a Bibliometric\\n  Study\", \"summary\": \"The development of autonomous robotic systems offers significant potential\\nfor performing complex tasks with precision and consistency. Recent advances in\\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) have enabled more capable intelligent automation\\nsystems, addressing increasingly complex challenges. However, this progress\\nraises questions about human roles in such systems. Human-Centered AI (HCAI)\\naims to balance human control and automation, ensuring performance enhancement\\nwhile maintaining creativity, mastery, and responsibility. For real-world\\napplications, autonomous robots must balance task performance with reliability,\\nsafety, and trustworthiness. Integrating HCAI principles enhances human-robot\\ncollaboration and ensures responsible operation.\\n  This paper presents a bibliometric analysis of intelligent autonomous robotic\\nsystems, utilizing SciMAT and VOSViewer to examine data from the Scopus\\ndatabase. The findings highlight academic trends, emerging topics, and AI's\\nrole in self-adaptive robotic behaviour, with an emphasis on HCAI architecture.\\nThese insights are then projected onto the IBM MAPE-K architecture, with the\\ngoal of identifying how these research results map into actual robotic\\nautonomous systems development efforts for real-world scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:45:48Z\"}"}
