The number of VAV elements (pixels) building the structures grow with\\nthe increase of self- and cross-interaction coefficients. Depending upon their\\nvalues and the trapping frequency, stable ring-shaped, circular, square-shaped,\\nrectangular, pentagonal, hexagonal, and triangular patterns are produced, with\\nthe central site left vacant or occupied in the lattice patterns of different\\ntypes. The results suggest the experimental creation of the new patterns and\\ntheir possible use for the design of integrated circuits in EP setups,\\ncontrolled by the strengths of the TE-TM splitting, nonlinearity, and HO trap.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T05:45:33Z\"}"}
