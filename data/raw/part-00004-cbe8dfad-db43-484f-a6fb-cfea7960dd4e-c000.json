{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01836v1\", \"title\": \"Estimating hazard rates from $\\u03b4$-records in discrete distributions\", \"summary\": \"This paper focuses on nonparametric statistical inference of the hazard rate\\nfunction of discrete distributions based on $\\\\delta$-record data. We derive the\\nexplicit expression of the maximum likelihood estimator and determine its exact\\ndistribution, as well as some important characteristics such as its bias and\\nmean squared error. We then discuss the construction of confidence intervals\\nand goodness-of-fit tests. The performance of our proposals is evaluated using\\nsimulation methods. Applications to real data are given, as well. The\\nestimation of the hazard rate function based on usual records has been studied\\nin the literature, although many procedures require several samples of records.\\nIn contrast, our approach relies on a single sequence of $\\\\delta$-records,\\nsimplifying the experimental design and increasing the applicability of the\\nmethods.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:43:19Z\"}"}
