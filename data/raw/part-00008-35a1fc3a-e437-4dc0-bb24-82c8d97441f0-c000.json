{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19959v1\", \"title\": \"From Concept to Practice: an Automated LLM-aided UVM Machine for RTL\\n  Verification\", \"summary\": \"Verification presents a major bottleneck in Integrated Circuit (IC)\\ndevelopment, consuming nearly 70% of the total development effort. While the\\nUniversal Verification Methodology (UVM) is widely used in industry to improve\\nverification efficiency through structured and reusable testbenches,\\nconstructing these testbenches and generating sufficient stimuli remain\\nchallenging. These challenges arise from the considerable manual coding effort\\nrequired, repetitive manual execution of multiple EDA tools, and the need for\\nin-depth domain expertise to navigate complex designs.Here, we present UVM^2,\\nan automated verification framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs)\\nto generate UVM testbenches and iteratively refine them using coverage\\nfeedback, significantly reducing manual effort while maintaining rigorous\\nverification standards.To evaluate UVM^2, we introduce a benchmark suite\\ncomprising Register Transfer Level (RTL) designs of up to 1.6K lines of\\ncode.The results show that UVM^2 reduces testbench setup time by up to UVM^2\\ncompared to experienced engineers, and achieve average code and function\\ncoverage of 87.44% and 89.58%, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions by\\n20.96% and 23.51%, respectively.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AR\", \"categories\": \"cs.AR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:33:08Z\"}"}
