{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21649v1\", \"title\": \"Spatio-temporal entanglement of the vacuum\", \"summary\": \"We demonstrate that the future and left Rindler wedges of Minkowski spacetime\\nare entangled, leading to the Unruh effect. Similarly, the past and right\\nRindler wedges are also entangled. We propose a protocol to extract this\\nentanglement using two two-state detectors located in the past and right\\nRindler wedges. By scaling the detector transition frequencies inversely with\\nMinkowski time, entanglement from the quantum field is transferred to the\\ndetectors, suggesting they may support quantum teleportation via the vacuum.\\nOur protocol can be implemented with current quantum systems, such as\\nflux-tunable transmon qubits. This research provides new insights into the\\nentanglement properties of spacetime and hints at practical applications for\\nsecure quantum information transfer using the vacuum state of a quantum field.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T13:54:35Z\"}"}
