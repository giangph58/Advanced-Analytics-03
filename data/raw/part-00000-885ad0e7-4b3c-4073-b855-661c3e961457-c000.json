{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24136v1\", \"title\": \"Numerical simulation of Generalized Hermite Processes\", \"summary\": \"Hermite processes are paradigmatic examples of stochastic processes which can\\nbelong to any Wiener chaos of an arbitrary order; the wellknown fractional\\nBrownian motion belonging to the Gaussian first order Wiener chaos and the\\nRosenblatt process belonging to the non-Gaussian second order Wiener chaos are\\ntwo particular cases of them. Except these two particular cases no simulation\\nmethod for sample paths of Hermite processes is available so far. The goal of\\nour article is to introduce a new method which potentially allows to simulate\\nsample paths of any Hermite process and even those of any generalized Hermite\\nprocess. Our starting point is the representation for the latter process as\\nrandom wavelet-typeseries, obtained in our very recent paper [3]. We construct\\nfrom it a \\\"concrete\\\" sequence of piecewise linear continuous random functions\\nwhich almost surely approximate sample paths of this process for the uniform\\nnorm on any compact interval, and we provide an almost sure estimate of the\\napproximation error. Then, for the Rosenblatt process and more importantly for\\nthe third order Hermite process, we propose algorithms allowing to implement\\nthis sequence and we illustrate them by several simulations. Python routines\\nimplementing these synthesis procedures are available upon request.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:18:42Z\"}"}
