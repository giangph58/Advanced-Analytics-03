We also\\nconsider the sharp upper bounds of distortion riskmetrics and weighted entropy\\nfor symmetric distribution under known mean and variance. These results are\\napplied to (weighted) entropies, shortfalls and other risk measures.\\nSpecifically, entropies include cumulative Tsallis past entropy, cumulative\\nresidual Tsallis entropy of order {\\\\alpha}, extended Gini coefficient,\\nfractional generalized cumulative residual entropy, and fractional generalized\\ncumulative entropy. Shortfalls include extended Gini shortfall, Gini shortfall,\\nshortfall of cumulative residual entropy, and shortfall of cumulative residual\\nTsallis entropy. Other risk measures include nth-order expected shortfall, dual\\npower principle and proportional hazard principle.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.RM\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.RM,stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T12:25:57Z\"}"}
