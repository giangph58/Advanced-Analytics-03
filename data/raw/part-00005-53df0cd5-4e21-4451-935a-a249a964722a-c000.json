We show that the\\nphoto-induced angular momentum increases with the square of the chiral-phonon\\nrelaxation time $\\\\tau$, giving a significantly larger angular momentum compared\\nto ordinary phonons. We also find that the photo-induced Peltier effect by\\nchiral phonons occurs through a mechanism distinct from those proposed\\nrecently; the induced energy current scales $\\\\propto\\\\tau^2$, giving a larger\\nenergy current in the clean limit. We prove a linear relation between the\\ngenerated angular momentum and the energy current. Lastly, we show that the\\norbital current, an analog of the spin current, occurs through a nonlinear\\nresponse. These findings demonstrate the unique properties and functionalities\\nof chiral phonons.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:00:50Z\"}"}
