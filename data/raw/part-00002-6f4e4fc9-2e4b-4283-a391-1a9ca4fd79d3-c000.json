We study the evolution of both the temporal (hard and soft\\nband photon count rates, hardness ratios, and QPO frequencies) and spectral\\nproperties of the source using NICER data between March 7 and October 4, 2023.\\nThe outburst profile and the nature of QPOs suggest that the source underwent a\\nmini-outburst following the primary outburst. A monotonic evolution of\\nlow-frequency QPOs from higher to lower frequencies is observed during the\\nprimary outbursting phase. Both phenomenological (diskbb plus powerlaw) and\\nphysical (Two Component Advective Flow) model fitted spectral studies suggest\\nthat during the entire epoch, the source remained in harder spectral states,\\nwith a clear dominance of nonthermal emissions from the `hot' Compton cloud.\\nThe 2023 outbursting activity of MAXI J1834$-$021 can be classified as a\\ncombination of double `failed' outbursts, as no softer spectral states were\\nobserved.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T04:00:31Z\"}"}
