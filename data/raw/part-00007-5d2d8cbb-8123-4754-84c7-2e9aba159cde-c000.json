{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17586v1\", \"title\": \"A Machine Learning Approach for Denoising and Upsampling HRTFs\", \"summary\": \"The demand for realistic virtual immersive audio continues to grow, with\\nHead-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) playing a key role. HRTFs capture how\\nsound reaches our ears, reflecting unique anatomical features and enhancing\\nspatial perception. It has been shown that personalized HRTFs improve\\nlocalization accuracy, but their measurement remains time-consuming and\\nrequires a noise-free environment. Although machine learning has been shown to\\nreduce the required measurement points and, thus, the measurement time, a\\ncontrolled environment is still necessary. This paper proposes a method to\\naddress this constraint by presenting a novel technique that can upsample\\nsparse, noisy HRTF measurements. The proposed approach combines an HRTF Denoisy\\nU-Net for denoising and an Autoencoding Generative Adversarial Network (AE-GAN)\\nfor upsampling from three measurement points. The proposed method achieves a\\nlog-spectral distortion (LSD) error of 5.41 dB and a cosine similarity loss of\\n0.0070, demonstrating the method's effectiveness in HRTF upsampling.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SD\", \"categories\": \"cs.SD,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:17:57Z\"}"}
