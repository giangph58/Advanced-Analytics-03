Here, we present a unified\\nframework for solving discrete-time optimal control with higher-order state and\\ncontrol costs of power-law form. By building convex-completion techniques, we\\nderive semi-explicit expressions for control laws, cost-to-go functions, and\\nrecursive coefficient dynamics across deterministic and stochastic system\\nsettings. Key contributions include variance-aware solutions under additive and\\nmultiplicative noise, extensions to mean-field-type-dependent dynamics, and\\nconditions that ensure the positivity of recursive coefficients. In particular,\\nwe establish that higher-order costs induce less aggressive control policies\\ncompared to quadratic formulations, a finding that is validated through\\nnumerical analyses.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T04:03:36Z\"}"}
