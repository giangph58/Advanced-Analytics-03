{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00695v1\", \"title\": \"Simple Holography in General Spacetimes\", \"summary\": \"The simple or \\\"outermost\\\" wedge in AdS is the portion of the entanglement\\nwedge that can be reconstructed with sub-exponential effort from CFT data. Here\\nwe furnish a definition in arbitrary spacetimes: given an input wedge $a$\\nanalogous to a CFT boundary region, the simple wedge $z(a)$ is the largest\\nwedge accessible by a \\\"zigzag,\\\" a certain sequence of antinormal light-sheets.\\nWe show that $z(a)$ is a throat, and that it is contained in every other\\nthroat. This implies that $z(a)$ is unique; that it is contained in the\\ngeneralized entanglement wedge; and that it reduces to the AdS prescription as\\na special case.\\n  The zigzag explicitly constructs a preferred Cauchy slice that renders the\\nsimple wedge accessible from $a$; thus it adds a novel structure even in AdS.\\nSo far, no spacelike construction is known to reproduce these results, even in\\ntime-symmetric settings. This may have implications for the modeling of\\nholographic encoding by tensor networks.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T17:55:50Z\"}"}
