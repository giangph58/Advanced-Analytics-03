It exploits the\\ndependence of the Hall resistance on the magnetization direction, although\\nthermal phenomena also contribute. Historically, deviations from the expected\\nmagnetic field dependence have usually been neglected. Based on our studies on\\npermalloy/platinum bilayers, we show that a unidirectional magnetoresistance -\\nknown to appear in the second-harmonic longitudinal resistance - also appears\\nin the Hall data, and that describing the results in a wide field range with\\nthese contributions is essential to accurately estimate the torques.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T12:28:20Z\"}"}
