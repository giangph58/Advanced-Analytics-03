{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11279v1\", \"title\": \"Simulation-based inference for stochastic nonlinear mixed-effects models\\n  with applications in systems biology\", \"summary\": \"The analysis of data from multiple experiments, such as observations of\\nseveral individuals, is commonly approached using mixed-effects models, which\\naccount for variation between individuals through hierarchical representations.\\nThis makes mixed-effects models widely applied in fields such as biology,\\npharmacokinetics, and sociology. In this work, we propose a novel methodology\\nfor scalable Bayesian inference in hierarchical mixed-effects models. Our\\nframework first constructs amortized approximations of the likelihood and the\\nposterior distribution, which are then rapidly refined for each individual\\ndataset, to ultimately approximate the parameters posterior across many\\nindividuals. The framework is easily trainable, as it uses mixtures of experts\\nbut without neural networks, leading to parsimonious yet expressive surrogate\\nmodels of the likelihood and the posterior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\\nour methodology using challenging stochastic models, such as mixed-effects\\nstochastic differential equations emerging in systems biology-driven problems.\\nHowever, the approach is broadly applicable and can accommodate both stochastic\\nand deterministic models. We show that our approach can seamlessly handle\\ninference for many parameters. Additionally, we applied our method to a\\nreal-data case study of mRNA transfection. When compared to exact\\npseudomarginal Bayesian inference, our approach proved to be both fast and\\ncompetitive in terms of statistical accuracy.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.CO\", \"categories\": \"stat.CO,stat.ME,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:18:58Z\"}"}
