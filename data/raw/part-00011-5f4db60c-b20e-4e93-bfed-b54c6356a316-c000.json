{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13036v1\", \"title\": \"A generalized energy-based modeling framework with application to\\n  field/circuit coupled problems\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents a generalized energy-based modeling framework extending\\nrecent formulations tailored for differential-algebraic equations. The proposed\\nstructure, inspired by the port-Hamiltonian formalism, ensures passivity,\\npreserves the power balance, and facilitates the consistent interconnection of\\nsubsystems. A particular focus is put on low-frequency power applications in\\nelectrical engineering. Stranded, solid, and foil conductor models are\\ninvestigated in the context of the eddy current problem. Each conductor model\\nis shown to fit into the generalized energy-based structure, which allows their\\nstructure-preserving coupling with electrical circuits described by modified\\nnodal analysis. Theoretical developments are validated through a numerical\\nsimulation of an oscillator circuit, demonstrating energy conservation in\\nlossless scenarios and controlled dissipation when eddy currents are present.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T15:45:20Z\"}"}
