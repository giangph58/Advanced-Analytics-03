We consider the well-studied problem of\\nconfigurational analysis of materials and, more specifically, finding the\\nlowest energy configuration of defective graphene structures. This problem acts\\nas a test-case which allows us to study various algorithms that are applicable\\nto Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO) problems, which are\\ngenerally classically intractable exactly. To solve this problem, we implement\\ntwo methods, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Quantum Annealing\\n(QA), on commercially-available gate-based and quantum annealing devices that\\nare accessible via Quantum-Computing-as-a-Service (QCaaS) models. To analyse\\nthe performance of these algorithms, we use a toolbox of relevant metrics and\\ncompare performance against three classical algorithms. We employ quantum\\nmethods to solve fully-connected QUBOs of up to $72$ variables, and find that\\nalgorithm performance beyond this is restricted by device connectivity, noise\\nand classical computation time overheads. The applicability of our approach\\ngoes beyond the selected configurational analysis test-case, and we anticipate\\nthat our approach will be of use for optimisation problems in general.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:38:44Z\"}"}
