{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00562v1\", \"title\": \"TeLoGraF: Temporal Logic Planning via Graph-encoded Flow Matching\", \"summary\": \"Learning to solve complex tasks with signal temporal logic (STL)\\nspecifications is crucial to many real-world applications. However, most\\nprevious works only consider fixed or parametrized STL specifications due to\\nthe lack of a diverse STL dataset and encoders to effectively extract temporal\\nlogic information for downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose TeLoGraF,\\nTemporal Logic Graph-encoded Flow, which utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNN)\\nencoder and flow-matching to learn solutions for general STL specifications. We\\nidentify four commonly used STL templates and collect a total of 200K\\nspecifications with paired demonstrations. We conduct extensive experiments in\\nfive simulation environments ranging from simple dynamical models in the 2D\\nspace to high-dimensional 7DoF Franka Panda robot arm and Ant quadruped\\nnavigation. Results show that our method outperforms other baselines in the STL\\nsatisfaction rate. Compared to classical STL planning algorithms, our approach\\nis 10-100X faster in inference and can work on any system dynamics. Besides, we\\nshow our graph-encoding method's capability to solve complex STLs and\\nrobustness to out-distribution STL specifications.
