First, we study HKKN stratifications, both\\nalgebraically and analytically, for a Cartesian product between a vector space\\nand a compact K{\\\\\\\"a}hler manifold. We then use these stratifications to prove\\nconvexity properties of the moment map for non-compact analytic subsets\\ninvariant under a Borel subgroup.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG,math.DG,math.SG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T07:40:53Z\"}"}
