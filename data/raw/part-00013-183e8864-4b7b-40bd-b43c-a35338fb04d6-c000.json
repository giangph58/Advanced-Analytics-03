Traditional techniques often require\\nmultiple X-ray projections from various angles to obtain a comprehensive view,\\nleading to increased radiation exposure and more complex clinical processes.\\nThis paper explores an innovative approach using the DL-GIPS model, which\\nsynthesizes X-ray projections from new viewpoints by leveraging a single\\nexisting projection. The model strategically manipulates geometry and texture\\nfeatures extracted from an initial projection to match new viewing angles. It\\nthen synthesizes the final projection by merging these modified geometry\\nfeatures with consistent texture information through an advanced image\\ngeneration process. We demonstrate the effectiveness and broad applicability of\\nthe DL-GIPS framework through lung imaging examples, highlighting its potential\\nto revolutionize stereoscopic and volumetric imaging by minimizing the need for\\nextensive data acquisition.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T10:30:08Z\"}"}
