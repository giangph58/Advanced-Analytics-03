Although ML is\\nstrong at discovering non-linearities and interactions, this power is currently\\ncompromised by a lack of reliable inference. Although local measures of feature\\neffect can be combined with tree ensembles, uncertainty quantifications for\\nthese measures remain only partially available and oftentimes unsatisfactory.\\nWe propose RuleSHAP, a framework for using rule-based, hypothesis-free\\ndiscovery that combines sparse Bayesian regression, tree ensembles and Shapley\\nvalues in a one-step procedure that both detects and tests complex patterns at\\nthe individual level. To ease computation, we derive a formula that computes\\nmarginal Shapley values more efficiently for our setting. We demonstrate the\\nvalidity of our framework on simulated data. To illustrate, we apply our\\nmachinery to data from an epidemiological cohort to detect and infer several\\neffects for high cholesterol and blood pressure, such as nonlinear interaction\\neffects between features like age, sex, ethnicity, BMI and glucose level.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ML\", \"categories\": \"stat.ML,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T14:55:22Z\"}"}
