While effective for small-scale scenes, these\\ndatasets require large image sets and extensive structure-from-motion (SfM)\\nprocessing, limiting scalability. To address this, we introduce a fisheye image\\ndataset tailored for scene reconstruction tasks. Using dual 200-degree fisheye\\nlenses, our dataset provides full 360-degree coverage of 5 indoor and 5 outdoor\\nscenes. Each scene has sparse SfM point clouds and precise LIDAR-derived dense\\npoint clouds that can be used as geometric ground-truth, enabling robust\\nbenchmarking under challenging conditions such as occlusions and reflections.\\nWhile the baseline experiments focus on vanilla Gaussian Splatting and NeRF\\nbased Nerfacto methods, the dataset supports diverse approaches for scene\\nreconstruction, novel view synthesis, and image-based rendering.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T13:41:23Z\"}"}
