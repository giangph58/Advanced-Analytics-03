{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03387v1\", \"title\": \"Improving Omics-Based Classification: The Role of Feature Selection and\\n  Synthetic Data Generation\", \"summary\": \"Given the increasing complexity of omics datasets, a key challenge is not\\nonly improving classification performance but also enhancing the transparency\\nand reliability of model decisions. Effective model performance and feature\\nselection are fundamental for explainability and reliability. In many cases,\\nhigh dimensional omics datasets suffer from limited number of samples due to\\nclinical constraints, patient conditions, phenotypes rarity and others\\nconditions. Current omics based classification models often suffer from narrow\\ninterpretability, making it difficult to discern meaningful insights where\\ntrust and reproducibility are critical. This study presents a machine learning\\nbased classification framework that integrates feature selection with data\\naugmentation techniques to achieve high standard classification accuracy while\\nensuring better interpretability. Using the publicly available dataset (E MTAB\\n8026), we explore a bootstrap analysis in six binary classification scenarios\\nto evaluate the proposed model's behaviour. We show that the proposed pipeline\\nyields cross validated perfomance on small dataset that is conserved when the\\ntrained classifier is applied to a larger test set. Our findings emphasize the\\nfundamental balance between accuracy and feature selection, highlighting the\\npositive effect of introducing synthetic data for better generalization, even\\nin scenarios with very limited samples availability.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T10:09:50Z\"}"}
