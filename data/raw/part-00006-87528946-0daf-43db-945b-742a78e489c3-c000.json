Our approach is based on\\nfinding suitable degree-$3$ coverings of the projective line by such plane\\nquartics and on the different function of Cohen, Temkin, and Trushin associated\\nto the analytifications of these coverings. In particular, we give an explicit\\nformula for computing the different function on a given interval. The resulting\\nalgorithm for computing the semistable reduction of plane quartics is\\nimplemented in SageMath, and we illustrate it by determining the semistable\\nreduction of a particular plane quartic at $p=3$ that arises as a quotient of\\nthe non-split Cartan modular curve $X^+_{ns}(27)$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T13:33:52Z\"}"}
