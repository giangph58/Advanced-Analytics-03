{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19900v1\", \"title\": \"Breast Cancer Detection from Multi-View Screening Mammograms with Visual\\n  Prompt Tuning\", \"summary\": \"Accurate detection of breast cancer from high-resolution mammograms is\\ncrucial for early diagnosis and effective treatment planning. Previous studies\\nhave shown the potential of using single-view mammograms for breast cancer\\ndetection. However, incorporating multi-view data can provide more\\ncomprehensive insights. Multi-view classification, especially in medical\\nimaging, presents unique challenges, particularly when dealing with\\nlarge-scale, high-resolution data. In this work, we propose a novel Multi-view\\nVisual Prompt Tuning Network (MVPT-NET) for analyzing multiple screening\\nmammograms. We first pretrain a robust single-view classification model on\\nhigh-resolution mammograms and then innovatively adapt multi-view feature\\nlearning into a task-specific prompt tuning process. This technique selectively\\ntunes a minimal set of trainable parameters (7\\\\%) while retaining the\\nrobustness of the pre-trained single-view model, enabling efficient integration\\nof multi-view data without the need for aggressive downsampling. Our approach\\noffers an efficient alternative to traditional feature fusion methods,\\nproviding a more robust, scalable, and efficient solution for high-resolution\\nmammogram analysis. Experimental results on a large multi-institution dataset\\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms conventional approaches while\\nmaintaining detection efficiency, achieving an AUROC of 0.852 for\\ndistinguishing between Benign, DCIS, and Invasive classes. This work highlights\\nthe potential of MVPT-NET for medical imaging tasks and provides a scalable\\nsolution for integrating multi-view data in breast cancer detection.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:31:08Z\"}"}
