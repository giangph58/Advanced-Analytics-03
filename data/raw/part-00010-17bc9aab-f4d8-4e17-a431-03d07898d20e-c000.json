We show that kinetic simulations\\nof moderate Alfv\\\\'enic Mach number, magnetized, collisionless shocks reveal\\nrapid, faster-than-Coulomb, energy exchange between ions and electrons when the\\nplasma is sufficiently magnetized. Using kinetic and multi-fluid models with\\ncounter-streaming ions, we identify resonances between electron whistler and\\nion magnetohydrodynamic waves that account for this rapid energy exchange.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T17:48:21Z\"}"}
