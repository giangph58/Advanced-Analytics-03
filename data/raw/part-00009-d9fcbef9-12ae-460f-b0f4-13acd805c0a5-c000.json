{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11851v1\", \"title\": \"A Bidirectional DeepParticle Method for Efficiently Solving\\n  Low-dimensional Transport Map Problems\", \"summary\": \"This paper aims to efficiently compute transport maps between probability\\ndistributions arising from particle representation of bio-physical problems. We\\ndevelop a bidirectional DeepParticle (BDP) method to learn and generate\\nsolutions under varying physical parameters. Solutions are approximated as\\nempirical measures of particles that adaptively align with the high-gradient\\nregions. The core idea of the BDP method is to learn both forward and reverse\\nmappings (between the uniform and a non-trivial target distribution) by\\nminimizing the discrete 2-Wasserstein distance (W2) and optimizing the\\ntransition map therein by a minibatch technique. We present numerical results\\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of the BDP method for learning and generating\\nsolutions to Keller-Segel chemotaxis systems in the presence of laminar flows\\nand Kolmogorov flows with chaotic streamlines in three space dimensions. The\\nBDP outperforms two recent representative single-step flow matching and\\ndiffusion models (rectified flow and shortcut diffusion models) in the\\ngenerative AI literature. However when the target distribution is\\nhigh-dimensional (4 and above), e.g. a mixture of two Gaussians, the\\nsingle-step diffusion models scale better in dimensions than BDP in terms of\\nW2-accuracy.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T08:19:43Z\"}"}
