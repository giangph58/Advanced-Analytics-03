{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04951v1\", \"title\": \"On the arithmetic average of the first $n$ primes\", \"summary\": \"The arithmetic average of the first $n$ primes, $\\\\bar p_n = {1\\\\over n}\\n\\\\sum_{i=1}^n p_i$, exhibits very many interesting properties. Since the\\ntransformation from $p_n \\\\to \\\\bar p_n$ is extremely easy to invert, $p_n =\\nn\\\\bar p_n - (n-1)\\\\bar p_{n-1}$, it is clear that these two sequences $p_n\\n\\\\longleftrightarrow \\\\bar p_n$ must ultimately carry exactly the same\\ninformation. But the averaged sequence $\\\\bar p_n$, while very closely\\ncorrelated with the primes ($\\\\bar p_n \\\\sim {1\\\\over2} p_n$) is much \\\"smoother\\\",\\nand much better behaved. Using extensions of various standard results I shall\\ndemonstrate that the prime-averaged sequence $\\\\bar p_n$ satisfies\\nprime-averaged analogues of the Cramer, Andrica, Legendre, and Firoozbakht\\nconjectures. (So these prime-averaged analogues are not conjectures, they are\\ntheorems.) The crucial key to enabling this pleasant behaviour is the\\n\\\"smoothing\\\" process inherent in averaging. Whereas the asymptotic behaviour of\\nthe two sequences is very closely correlated the local fluctuations are quite\\ndifferent.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T05:10:43Z\"}"}
