The author\\npresents a clear way of deriving participation number in a continuous case\\nwithout making any assumptions about the system, fluid or flow regime.\\nMoreover, a method of computing participation number in discretized cases is\\ndiscussed and verified against well known analytical solutions using three\\nmethods, in which one was used previously in research on fluid flow through\\nporous media. A robust formula, that works for both uniform and nonuniform\\ndiscretization grids is presented.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:26:47Z\"}"}
