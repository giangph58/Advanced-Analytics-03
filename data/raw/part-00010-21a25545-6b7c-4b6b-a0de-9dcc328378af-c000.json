{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14951v1\", \"title\": \"A Purely Data-Driven Adaptive Impedance Matching Method Robust to\\n  Parasitic Effects\", \"summary\": \"Adaptive impedance matching between antennas and radio frequency front-end\\n(RFFE) power modules is essential for mobile communication systems. To address\\nthe matching performance degradation caused by parasitic effects in practical\\ntunable matching networks (TMN), this paper proposes a purely data-driven\\nadaptive impedance matching method that avoids trial-and-error physical\\nadjustment. First, we propose the residual enhanced circuit behavior modeling\\nnetwork (RECBM-Net), a deep learning model that maps TMN operating states to\\ntheir scattering parameters (S-parameters). Then, we formulate the matching\\nprocess based on the trained surrogate model as a mathematical optimization\\nproblem. We employ two classic numerical methods with different online\\ncomputational overhead, namely simulated annealing particle swarm optimization\\n(SAPSO) and adaptive moment estimation with automatic differentiation\\n(AD-Adam), to search for the matching solution. To further reduce the online\\ninference overhead caused by repeated forward propagation through RECBM-Net, we\\ntrain an inverse mapping solver network (IMS-Net) to directly predict the\\noptimal solution. Simulation results show that RECBM-Net achieves exceptionally\\nhigh modeling accuracy. While AD-Adam significantly reduces computational\\noverhead compared to SAPSO, it sacrifices slight accuracy. IMS-Net offers the\\nlowest online overhead while maintaining excellent matching accuracy.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T08:17:41Z\"}"}
