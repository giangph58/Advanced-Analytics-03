{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03702v1\", \"title\": \"Self-Supervised Learning for Robotic Leaf Manipulation: A Hybrid\\n  Geometric-Neural Approach\", \"summary\": \"Automating leaf manipulation in agricultural settings faces significant\\nchallenges, including the variability of plant morphologies and deformable\\nleaves. We propose a novel hybrid geometric-neural approach for autonomous leaf\\ngrasping that combines traditional computer vision with neural networks through\\nself-supervised learning. Our method integrates YOLOv8 for instance\\nsegmentation and RAFT-Stereo for 3D depth estimation to build rich leaf\\nrepresentations, which feed into both a geometric feature scoring pipeline and\\na neural refinement module (GraspPointCNN). The key innovation is our\\nconfidence-weighted fusion mechanism that dynamically balances the contribution\\nof each approach based on prediction certainty. Our self-supervised framework\\nuses the geometric pipeline as an expert teacher to automatically generate\\ntraining data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves an 88.0%\\nsuccess rate in controlled environments and 84.7% in real greenhouse\\nconditions, significantly outperforming both purely geometric (75.3%) and\\nneural (60.2%) methods. This work establishes a new paradigm for agricultural\\nrobotics where domain expertise is seamlessly integrated with machine learning\\ncapabilities, providing a foundation for fully automated crop monitoring\\nsystems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.CV,cs.LG,I.2.10\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T17:22:21Z\"}"}
