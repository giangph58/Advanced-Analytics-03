Spin-transport for different thicknesses (1, 3, 5,\\nand 7 layers) of the spacer MoS2 and for two different surface orientations of\\nthe Fe electrode, the Fe(001) and Fe(111) surface and the effect of\\nsubstitutional doping of magnetic impurity Cr on the spin-transport of the\\njunctions is investigated. The electronic structure of the heterostructure\\nshows presence of metal induced states in the semiconducting MoS2 at the\\nFe/MoS2 interface and the effect of the interface is limited to the first two\\nlayers of MoS2 from the interface. The I-V characteristics of the junctions for\\nthe monolayer and three-layer MoS2 spacer show linear behaviour due to the\\nmetallic nature of the junction. The tunneling nature of the junction is\\nobserved for the thicker junctions with five-layer and seven-layer spacers.\\nWith the introduction of magnetic impurity, we have shown that\\nspin-polarisation in the spacer is improved, thus increasing the spin-polarised\\ncurrent. The Cr-defect states are observed below the conduction band and the\\nCr-doped devices are stable up to a bias of 0.5V. The close packed Fe(111)\\nsurface is better electrode material for tunneling of electrons through the\\njunction compared to the Fe(001) surface due to lower surface energy and\\nreduced transmission.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T05:59:27Z\"}"}
