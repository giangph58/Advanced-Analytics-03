{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16498v1\", \"title\": \"LiDAL-Assisted RLNC-NOMA in OWC Systems\", \"summary\": \"Optical wireless communication (OWC) is envisioned as a key enabler for\\nimmersive indoor data transmission in future wireless communication networks.\\nHowever, multi-user interference management arises as a challenge in dense\\nindoor OWC systems composed of multiple optical access points (APs) serving\\nmultiple users. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-function OWC system for\\ncommunication and localization. Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with\\nrandom linear network coding (RLNC) is designed for data transmission, where\\nNOMA allows the serving of multiple users simultaneously through controlling\\nthe power domain, and RLNC helps minimize errors that might occur during signal\\nprocessing phase. This setup is assisted with a light detection and\\nlocalization system (LiDAL) that can passively obtain spatio-temporal indoor\\ninformation of user presence and location for dynamic-user grouping. The\\ndesigned LiDAL system helps to improve the estimation of channel state\\ninformation (CSI) in realistic indoor network scenarios, where the CSI of\\nindoor users might be noisy and/or highly correlated. We evaluate the\\nperformance of NOMA combined with RLNC by analyzing the probability of\\nsuccessful decoding compared to conventional NOMA and orthogonal schemes. In\\naddition, we derive the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) to evaluate the accuracy\\nof location estimation. The results show that the proposed RLNC-NOMA improves\\nthe probability of successful decoding and the overall system performance. The\\nresults also show the high accuracy of the unbiased location estimator and its\\nassistant in reducing the imperfection of CSI, leading to high overall system\\nperformance.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.IT,cs.SY,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T08:22:28Z\"}"}
