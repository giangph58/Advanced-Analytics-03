{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04404v1\", \"title\": \"In-Context Adaptation to Concept Drift for Learned Database Operations\", \"summary\": \"Machine learning has demonstrated transformative potential for database\\noperations, such as query optimization and in-database data analytics. However,\\ndynamic database environments, characterized by frequent updates and evolving\\ndata distributions, introduce concept drift, which leads to performance\\ndegradation for learned models and limits their practical applicability.\\nAddressing this challenge requires efficient frameworks capable of adapting to\\nshifting concepts while minimizing the overhead of retraining or fine-tuning.\\n  In this paper, we propose FLAIR, an online adaptation framework that\\nintroduces a new paradigm called \\\\textit{in-context adaptation} for learned\\ndatabase operations. FLAIR leverages the inherent property of data systems,\\ni.e., immediate availability of execution results for predictions, to enable\\ndynamic context construction. By formalizing adaptation as $f:(\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\,|\\n\\\\,\\\\mathcal{C}_t) \\\\to \\\\mathbf{y}$, with $\\\\mathcal{C}_t$ representing a dynamic\\ncontext memory, FLAIR delivers predictions aligned with the current concept,\\neliminating the need for runtime parameter optimization. To achieve this, FLAIR\\nintegrates two key modules: a Task Featurization Module for encoding\\ntask-specific features into standardized representations, and a Dynamic\\nDecision Engine, pre-trained via Bayesian meta-training, to adapt seamlessly\\nusing contextual information at runtime. Extensive experiments across key\\ndatabase tasks demonstrate that FLAIR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,\\nachieving up to 5.2x faster adaptation and reducing error by 22.5% for\\ncardinality estimation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DB\", \"categories\": \"cs.DB,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T13:36:59Z\"}"}
