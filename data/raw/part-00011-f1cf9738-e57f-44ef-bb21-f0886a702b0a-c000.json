We revise constraints on the strength and\\ncorrelation length of such fields from the requirement that their decay does\\nnot lead to over-production of the baryon asymmetry. We show that the helical\\nfields with strength down to 1e-5 of the maximal possible strength during the\\nElectroweak epoch should have had their correlation at least ~1e-6 of the\\nHubble radius during this epoch. For weaker fields this lower bound on the\\ncorrelation length relaxes proportionally to the square of magnetic field\\nstrength. A field with parameters saturating the bound may actually be\\nresponsible for the baryon asymmetry observed today. We show that relic of such\\na field, surviving in the present day Universe in the form of intergalactic\\nmagnetic field detectable with Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, may have\\nthe strength up to 10-100 pG and can have parameters needed to affect the\\ncosmological recombination and relax the Hubble tension. We also show that\\nthere is no constraint on the parameters of helical or non-helical magnetic\\nfields stemming from the requirement that the baryon isocurvature perturbations\\nproduced by such fields during the Electroweak epoch are within the\\nobservational limits.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:50:47Z\"}"}
