{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14898v1\", \"title\": \"Expected Free Energy-based Planning as Variational Inference\", \"summary\": \"We address the problem of planning under uncertainty, where an agent must\\nchoose actions that not only achieve desired outcomes but also reduce\\nuncertainty. Traditional methods often treat exploration and exploitation as\\nseparate objectives, lacking a unified inferential foundation. Active\\ninference, grounded in the Free Energy Principle, offers such a foundation by\\nminimizing Expected Free Energy (EFE), a cost function that combines utility\\nwith epistemic drives like ambiguity resolution and novelty seeking. However,\\nthe computational burden of EFE minimization has remained a major obstacle to\\nits scalability. In this paper, we show that EFE-based planning arises\\nnaturally from minimizing a variational free energy functional on a generative\\nmodel augmented with preference and epistemic priors. This result reinforces\\ntheoretical consistency with the Free Energy Principle, by casting planning\\nitself as variational inference. Our formulation yields optimal policies that\\njointly support goal achievement and information gain, while incorporating a\\ncomplexity term that accounts for bounded computational resources. This\\nunifying framework connects and extends existing methods, enabling scalable,\\nresource-aware implementations of active inference agents.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ML\", \"categories\": \"stat.ML,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T07:09:05Z\"}"}
