{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21765v1\", \"title\": \"Evaluation of In Vivo Subject-Specific Mechanical Modeling of the Optic\\n  Nerve Head for Robust Assessment of Ocular Mechanics\", \"summary\": \"To establish the tissue regions necessary to accurately represent the\\nmechanics of the optic nerve head (ONH), imaging data of the ONH from 2 healthy\\nsubjects were used to create in vivo subject-specific eye mechanical models\\nconsidering distinct properties for all major ocular tissues. Tests were\\nperformed to evaluate the effect of the material properties and the inclusion\\nof these tissues on the mechanics of the lamina cribrosa (LC), retina, and\\noptic nerve. Then, the LC mechanical response due to variations in intraocular\\nand intracranial pressures was evaluated to validate the modeling approach. The\\nsclera stiffness has the largest impact on the mechanics of the LC, retina, and\\noptic nerve, while Bruchs membrane has a negligible effect on these tissues\\nresponse. The validation tests showed increased LC strain with increased\\npressure and highest strains in the inferior and temporal subregion, as seen in\\nliterature studies. Consequently, accurate ONH mechanical representation can be\\nobtained by only including those tissue regions identified as necessary.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.med-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.med-ph,physics.bio-ph,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T16:05:50Z\"}"}
