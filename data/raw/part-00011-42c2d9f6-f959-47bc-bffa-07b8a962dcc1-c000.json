Chem. Phys., 158, 124102 (2023)], based\\naround the conservation of directly computed spectral moments of the GW\\nself-energy. Featuring a number of desirable formal properties over other\\nimplementations, we also detail efficiency improvements and a parallelism\\nstrategy, resulting in an implementation with a demonstrable similar scaling to\\nan established Hartree--Fock code, with only an order of magnitude increase in\\ncost. We also detail the applicability of a range of self-consistent $GW$\\nvariants within this framework, including a scheme for full self-consistency of\\nall dynamical variables, whilst avoiding the Matsubara axis or analytic\\ncontinuation, allowing formal convergence at zero temperature. By investigating\\na range of self-consistency protocols over the GW100 molecular test set, we\\nfind that a little-explored self-consistent variant based around a simpler\\ncoupled chemical potential and Fock matrix optimization to be the most accurate\\nself-consistent $GW$ approach. Additionally, we validate recently observed\\nevidence that Tamm--Dancoff based screening approximations within $GW$ lead to\\nhigher accuracy than traditional random phase approximation screening over\\nthese molecular test cases. Finally, we consider the Chlorophyll A molecule,\\nfinding agreement with experiment within the experimental uncertainty, and a\\ndescription of the full-frequency spectrum of charged excitations.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph,cond-mat.str-el,physics.comp-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T11:00:22Z\"}"}
