The $f^{\\\\prime}_{01}$ was measured for\\nproton knockout from the $1\\\\mathrm{d}_{3/2}$ shell in $^{40}\\\\mathrm{Ca}$ via\\nthe $^{40}{\\\\rm Ca}(\\\\vec{e},e' p)^{39}{\\\\rm K}_{\\\\rm g.s.}$ reaction, leaving the\\nresidual nucleus in a well-defined state. It requires a longitudinally\\npolarized electron beam and out-of-plane proton detection. This structure\\nfunction vanishes in the absence of final-state interactions (FSI) involving\\nthe ejected proton. Presented are the dependencies of $f^{\\\\prime}_{01}$ on the\\nmissing momentum (closely related to the initial proton's Fermi momentum) and\\nthe angle between the knocked-out proton and the virtual photon momenta. The\\nrole of the spin-orbit interaction in FSI through the $\\\\vec{L}\\\\cdot \\\\vec{S}$\\nterm in a nuclear optical potential is discussed.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-ex\", \"categories\": \"nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T08:23:53Z\"}"}
