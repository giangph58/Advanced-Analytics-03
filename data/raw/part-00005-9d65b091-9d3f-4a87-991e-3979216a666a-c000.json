{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21788v1\", \"title\": \"The Challenges of Detecting Gases in Exoplanet Atmospheres\", \"summary\": \"Claims of detections of gases in exoplanet atmospheres often rely on\\ncomparisons between models including and excluding specific chemical species.\\nHowever, the space of molecular combinations available for model construction\\nis vast and highly degenerate. Only a limited subset of these combinations is\\ntypically explored for any given detection. As a result, apparent detections of\\ntrace gases risk being artifacts of incomplete modeling rather than robust\\nidentification of atmospheric constituents, especially in the low\\nsignal-to-noise regime. We illustrate these challenges using the sub-Neptune\\nK2-18~b, where recent claims of a potential biosignature detection vanish when\\nthe considered model space is expanded. We show that numerous alternative\\nmodels without potential biosignature gases provide equivalent or better fits\\nto the observations. We demonstrate that the significance of a claimed\\ndetection relies on the choice of models being compared, and that model\\npreference does not necessarily imply the presence of any specific gas.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T16:47:28Z\"}"}
