We present a novel framework that\\nstreamlines this process by providing artists with intuitive control over\\ngenerated 3D heads. Our approach uses a geometry-aware texture synthesis\\npipeline that learns correlations between head geometry and skin texture maps\\nacross different demographics. The framework offers three levels of artistic\\ncontrol: manipulation of overall head geometry, adjustment of skin tone while\\npreserving facial characteristics, and fine-grained editing of details such as\\nwrinkles or facial hair. Our pipeline allows artists to make edits to a single\\ntexture map using familiar tools, with our system automatically propagating\\nthese changes coherently across the remaining texture maps needed for realistic\\nrendering. Experiments demonstrate that our method produces diverse results\\nwith clean geometries. We showcase practical applications focusing on intuitive\\ncontrol for artists, including skin tone adjustments and simplified editing\\nworkflows for adding age-related details or removing unwanted features from\\nscanned models. This integrated approach aims to streamline the artistic\\nworkflow in virtual character creation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GR\", \"categories\": \"cs.GR,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T13:11:35Z\"}"}
