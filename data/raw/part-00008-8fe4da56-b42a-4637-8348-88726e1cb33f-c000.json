{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17412v1\", \"title\": \"Catalytic Computing and Register Programs Beyond Log-Depth\", \"summary\": \"In a seminal work, Buhrman et al. (STOC 2014) defined the class $CSPACE(s,c)$\\nof problems solvable in space $s$ with an additional catalytic tape of size\\n$c$, which is a tape whose initial content must be restored at the end of the\\ncomputation. They showed that uniform $TC^1$ circuits are computable in\\ncatalytic logspace, i.e., $CL=CSPACE(O(\\\\log{n}), 2^{O(\\\\log{n})})$, thus giving\\nstrong evidence that catalytic space gives $L$ strict additional power. Their\\nstudy focuses on an arithmetic model called register programs, which has been a\\nfocal point in development since then.\\n  Understanding $CL$ remains a major open problem, as $TC^1$ remains the most\\npowerful containment to date. In this work, we study the power of catalytic\\nspace and register programs to compute circuits of larger depth. Using register\\nprograms, we show that for every $\\\\epsilon > 0$,\\n  $SAC^2 \\\\subseteq CSPACE\\\\left(O\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\log^2{n}}{\\\\log\\\\log{n}}\\\\right),\\n2^{O(\\\\log^{1+\\\\epsilon} n)}\\\\right)$\\n  This is an $O(\\\\log \\\\log n)$ factor improvement on the free space needed to\\ncompute $SAC^2$, which can be accomplished with near-polynomial catalytic\\nspace.\\n  We also exhibit non-trivial register programs for matrix powering, which is a\\nfurther step towards showing $NC^2 \\\\subseteq CL$.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CC\", \"categories\": \"cs.CC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T10:09:33Z\"}"}
