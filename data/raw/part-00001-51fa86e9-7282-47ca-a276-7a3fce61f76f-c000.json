A left query algorithm can ask the number of homomorphisms from\\nany structure to the input structure and a right query algorithm can ask the\\nnumber of homomorphisms from the input structure to any other structure. We\\nsystematically compare the expressive power of different types of left or right\\nquery algorithms, including non-adaptive query algorithms, adaptive query\\nalgorithms that can ask a bounded number of queries, and adaptive query\\nalgorithms that can ask an unbounded number of queries. We also consider query\\nalgorithms where the homomorphism counting is done over the Boolean semiring\\n$\\\\mathbb{B}$, meaning that only the existence of a homomorphism is recorded,\\nnot the precise number of them.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LO\", \"categories\": \"cs.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T09:46:39Z\"}"}
