{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12977v1\", \"title\": \"A Phenomenological Approach to Analyzing User Queries in IT Systems\\n  Using Heidegger's Fundamental Ontology\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents a novel research analytical IT system grounded in Martin\\nHeidegger's Fundamental Ontology, distinguishing between beings (das Seiende)\\nand Being (das Sein). The system employs two modally distinct, descriptively\\ncomplete languages: a categorical language of beings for processing user inputs\\nand an existential language of Being for internal analysis. These languages are\\nbridged via a phenomenological reduction module, enabling the system to analyze\\nuser queries (including questions, answers, and dialogues among IT\\nspecialists), identify recursive and self-referential structures, and provide\\nactionable insights in categorical terms. Unlike contemporary systems limited\\nto categorical analysis, this approach leverages Heidegger's phenomenological\\nexistential analysis to uncover deeper ontological patterns in query\\nprocessing, aiding in resolving logical traps in complex interactions, such as\\nmetaphor usage in IT contexts. The path to full realization involves\\nformalizing the language of Being by a research team based on Heidegger's\\nFundamental Ontology; given the existing completeness of the language of\\nbeings, this reduces the system's computability to completeness, paving the way\\nfor a universal query analysis tool. The paper presents the system's\\narchitecture, operational principles, technical implementation, use\\ncases--including a case based on real IT specialist dialogues--comparative\\nevaluation with existing tools, and its advantages and limitations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE,cs.AI,cs.CL,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T14:29:25Z\"}"}
