{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12274v1\", \"title\": \"Kernels for Storage Capacity and Dual Index Coding\", \"summary\": \"The storage capacity of a graph measures the maximum amount of information\\nthat can be stored across its vertices, such that the information at any vertex\\ncan be recovered from the information stored at its neighborhood. The study of\\nthis graph quantity is motivated by applications in distributed storage and by\\nits intimate relations to the index coding problem from the area of network\\ninformation theory. In the latter, one wishes to minimize the amount of\\ninformation that has to be transmitted to a collection of receivers, in a way\\nthat enables each of them to discover its required data using some prior side\\ninformation.\\n  In this paper, we initiate the study of the Storage Capacity and Index Coding\\nproblems from the perspective of parameterized complexity. We prove that the\\nStorage Capacity problem parameterized by the solution size admits a\\nkernelization algorithm producing kernels of linear size. We also provide such\\na result for the Index Coding problem, in the linear and non-linear settings,\\nwhere it is parameterized by the dual value of the solution, i.e., the length\\nof the transmission that can be saved using the side information. A key\\ningredient in the proofs is the crown decomposition technique due to Chor,\\nFellows, and Juedes (WG 2003, WG 2004). As an application, we significantly\\nextend an algorithmic result of Dau, Skachek, and Chee (IEEE Trans. Inform.\\nTheory, 2014).\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS,cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T17:34:58Z\"}"}
