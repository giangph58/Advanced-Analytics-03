{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16746v1\", \"title\": \"Beating the break-even point with autonomous quantum error correction\", \"summary\": \"Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for practical quantum computing,\\nas it protects fragile quantum information from errors by encoding it in\\nhigh-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Conventional QEC protocols typically require\\nrepeated syndrome measurements, real-time feedback, and the use of multiple\\nphysical qubits for encoding. Such implementations pose significant technical\\ncomplexities, particularly for trapped-ion systems, with high demands on\\nprecision and scalability. Here, we realize autonomous QEC with a logical qubit\\nencoded in multiple internal spin states of a single trapped ion, surpassing\\nthe break-even point for qubit lifetime. Our approach leverages engineered\\nspin-motion couplings to transfer error-induced entropy into motional modes,\\nwhich are subsequently dissipated through sympathetic cooling with an ancilla\\nion, fully eliminating the need for measurement and feedback. By repetitively\\napplying this autonomous QEC protocol under injected low-frequency noise, we\\nextend the logical qubit lifetime to approximately 11.6 ms, substantially\\noutperforming lifetime for both the physical qubit ($\\\\simeq$0.9 ms) and the\\nuncorrected logical qubit ($\\\\simeq$0.8 ms), thereby beating the break-even\\npoint with autonomous protection of quantum information without measurement or\\npost-selection. This work presents an efficient approach to fault-tolerant\\nquantum computing that harnesses the intrinsic multi-level structure of trapped\\nions, providing a distinctive path toward scalable architectures and robust\\nquantum memories with reduced overhead.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T14:16:41Z\"}"}
