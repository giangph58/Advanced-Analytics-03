{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01610v1\", \"title\": \"The Mini-SiTian Array: White Paper\", \"summary\": \"This paper outlines the scientific goals and observational strategies of the\\nMini-SiTian array. Mounted at Xinglong Observatory, the Mini-SiTian array\\nconsists of three 30 cm telescopes and has been in operation since 2022. The\\nlarge field of view, combined with the capability for multi-band photometric\\nobservations, enables the Mini-SiTian array to perform rapid follow-up\\nobservations to identify optical counterparts of gravitational waves, capture\\nthe early light curves of tidal disruption events and supernovae, and monitor\\nstellar flares, Be star outbursts, and cataclysmic variable stars, although its\\nlimiting magnitude is not very deep. By collaborating with the Xinglong 2.16-m\\ntelescope and leveraging a real-time image processing pipeline, simultaneous\\nphotometric and spectroscopic observations could be performed to reveal their\\nunderlying physical mechanisms. The observational and research experience\\nprovide critical guidance for the implementation of the full-scale SiTian\\nproject in the future.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:26:02Z\"}"}
