{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23839v1\", \"title\": \"Three-dimensional Optical Reconstruction of colloidal electrokinetics\\n  via multiplane imaging\", \"summary\": \"Selective manipulation of particles is crucial in many fields, ranging from\\nchemistry to biology and physics. Dielectrophoresis stands out due to its high\\nselectivity potential and the absence of need for labels. To fully understand\\nand control the phenomenon, observation of the dynamic of nanoparticles under\\nDEP needs to be performed in the three spatial dimensions. However, not many\\nmicroscopy approaches offer such capability at fast frame rates (>100fps) and\\nhigh resolution. Here, we used widefield microscopy, to follow the\\nspatiotemporal dynamics of fluorescently labelled polystyrene nanoparticles of\\n200 nm under positive and negative dielectrophoresis conditions. This real-time\\n3D imaging technique allows for single particle tracking, enabling\\nsuper-resolved reconstruction of the DEP force and electrokinetic flows with\\nunprecedented detail. We compare the differences for positive and negative\\ndielectrophoresis conditions and rationalize these by direct comparison with\\ndynamic modeling results. The framework shown here shows great promise to\\nelucidate the frequency-dependent DEP behavior of nanoparticle, crucial for\\nparticle manipulation and sorting.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T08:33:42Z\"}"}
