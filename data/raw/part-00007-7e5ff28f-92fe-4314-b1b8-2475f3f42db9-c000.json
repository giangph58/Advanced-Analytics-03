{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03637v1\", \"title\": \"Stabilizing 3D EPI time series by servo navigation and phase\\n  equalization exploiting repeated shots (PEERS)\", \"summary\": \"Purpose: To enable run-time head motion control and robust frequency\\ncorrections for 3D EPI fMRI. Methods: A short 3D orbital navigator (3 ms) is\\ninserted into a 3D EPI sequence. A linear perturbation model is calibrated to\\nestimate rigid motion and frequency parameters per shot. Rigid motion is\\ncorrected by scan geometry updates in run-time, while several techniques are\\ninvestigated to stabilize navigator-based frequency corrections in the\\nreconstruction. An additional method termed PEERS is proposed that exploits the\\nrepetitive structure of fMRI scans to fine-tune shot-wise phase and frequency\\nestimates using the motion-corrected EPI data itself. Results: Servo navigation\\neffectively reduces motion in the raw data of in-vivo fMRI scans in six\\nsubjects. PEERS provides high-precision frequency parameters for robust\\nphase-corrected reconstructions in the phantom and in-vivo accounting for\\nscanner drifts and slice encoding-related effects on EPI. In combination, servo\\nnavigation and PEERS achieve successful intra-volume corrections and consistent\\ntSNR improvements of 8% on average throughout the brain. The two methods prove\\nto be highly synergetic. Conclusion: Servo navigation achieves high-precision\\nmotion correction for 3D-EPI fMRI in run-time and, in synergy with PEERS,\\nprovides stable frequency corrections with short navigators even for long echo\\ntimes. With its automatic self-calibration and no hardware requirements, servo\\nnavigation and PEERS enable effective plug-and-play motion correction for 3D\\nfMRI.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,physics.med-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:39:39Z\"}"}
