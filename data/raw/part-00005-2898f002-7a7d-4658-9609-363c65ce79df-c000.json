We show that simple versions of this idea fail to describe\\nthe patterns of activity in networks of real neurons. An extended mean-field\\ntheory that matches the distribution of collective variables is at least\\nconsistent, though shows signs that these networks are poised near a critical\\npoint, in agreement with other observations. These results suggest a path to\\nanalysis of emerging data on ever larger numbers of neurons.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.bio-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.bio-ph,cond-mat.stat-mech,q-bio.NC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T16:11:02Z\"}"}
