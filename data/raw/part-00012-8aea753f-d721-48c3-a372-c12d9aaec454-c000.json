{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17678v1\", \"title\": \"MindFlow: A Network Traffic Anomaly Detection Model Based on MindSpore\", \"summary\": \"With the wide application of IoT and industrial IoT technologies, the network\\nstructure is becoming more and more complex, and the traffic scale is growing\\nrapidly, which makes the traditional security protection mechanism face serious\\nchallenges in dealing with high-frequency, diversified, and stealthy\\ncyber-attacks. To address this problem, this study proposes MindFlow, a\\nmulti-dimensional dynamic traffic prediction and anomaly detection system\\ncombining convolutional neural network (CNN) and bi-directional long and\\nshort-term memory network (BiLSTM) architectures based on the MindSpore\\nframework, and conducts systematic experiments on the NF-BoT-IoT dataset. The\\nexperimental results show that the proposed model achieves 99% in key metrics\\nsuch as accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score, effectively verifying its\\naccuracy and robustness in network intrusion detection.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:48:02Z\"}"}
