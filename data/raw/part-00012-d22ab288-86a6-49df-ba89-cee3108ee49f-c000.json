However, the full power it\\nexerts on the structure of the nucleon became apparent only afterwards. We\\npresent a high-level and somewhat personal overview of its role in almost every\\naspect of proton structure, from its mass and spin to the asymmetry of its\\nantimatter content and its strange quark content. The lessons learned from\\nstudying the proton are also vital with respect to the modern challenge of the\\nnature of baryon excited states.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T07:23:12Z\"}"}
