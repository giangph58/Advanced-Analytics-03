For $k=1$ this problem coincides with Maximum\\nWeight Independent Set, and for $k=2$ the problem is equivalent (by\\ncomplementation) to Minimum Odd Cycle Transversal. Furthermore, it generalizes\\n$k$-Coloring. We show that Max Partial $k$-Coloring on $n$-vertex instances\\nwith clique number $\\\\omega$ can be solved in time\\n  * $n^{\\\\mathcal{O}(k\\\\omega)}$ if the input graph excludes the bull and the\\nchair as an induced subgraph,\\n  * $n^{\\\\mathcal{O}(k\\\\omega \\\\log n)}$ if the input graph excludes the bull and\\nE as an induced subgraph.\\n  This implies that $k$-Coloring can be solved in polynomial time in the former\\nclass, and in quasipolynomial-time in the latter one.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CC\", \"categories\": \"cs.CC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:11:01Z\"}"}
