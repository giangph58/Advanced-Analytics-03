{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04227v1\", \"title\": \"Modeling of thin plate flexural vibrations by Partition of Unity Finite\\n  Element Method\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents a conforming thin plate bending element based on the\\nPartition of Unity Finite Element Method (PUFEM), for the simulation of\\nsteady-state forced vibration. The issue of ensuring the continuity of\\ndisplacement and slope between elements is addressed by the use of cubic\\nHermite-type Partition of Unity (PU) functions. With appropriate PU functions,\\nthe PUFEM allows the incorporation of the special enrichment functions into the\\nfinite elements to better cope with plate oscillations in a broad frequency\\nband. The enrichment strategies consist of the sum of a power series up to a\\ngiven order and a combination of progressive flexural wave solutions with\\npolynomials. The applicability and the effectiveness of the PUFEM plate\\nelements is first verified via the structural frequency response. Investigation\\nis then carried out to analyze the role of polynomial enrichment orders and\\nenriched plane wave distributions for achieving good computational performance\\nin terms of accuracy and data reduction. Numerical results show that the PUFEM\\nwith high-order polynomials and hybrid wave-polynomial combinations can provide\\nhighly accurate prediction results by using reduced degrees of freedom and\\nimproved rate of convergence, as compared with the classical FEM.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:25:46Z\"}"}
