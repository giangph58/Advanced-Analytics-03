High-level MSCs (HMSCs) extend\\nMSCs with choice, concatenation, and iteration, allowing for the specification\\nof complex behaviors. This paper revisits two classical problems for HMSCs:\\nsatisfiability and realizability. Satisfiability (also known as reachability or\\nnonemptiness) asks whether there exists a path in the HMSC that gives rise to a\\nvalid behavior. Realizability concerns translating HMSCs into communicating\\nfinite-state machines to ensure correct system implementations.\\n  While most positive results assume bounded channels, we introduce a class of\\nHMSCs that allows for unbounded channels while maintaining effective\\nimplementations. On the other hand, we show that the corresponding\\nsatisfiability problem is still undecidable.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LO\", \"categories\": \"cs.LO,cs.FL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:10:33Z\"}"}
