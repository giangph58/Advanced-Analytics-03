Given a graph $G$ and a parameter $k$, one has to decide if\\nthere is a set $S$ of at most $k$ vertices such that $G-S$ is acyclic. Assuming\\nthe Exponential Time Hypothesis, it is known that FVS cannot be solved in time\\n$2^{o(k)}n^{\\\\mathcal{O}(1)}$ in general graphs. To overcome this, many recent\\nresults considered FVS restricted to particular intersection graph classes and\\nprovided such $2^{o(k)}n^{\\\\mathcal{O}(1)}$ algorithms.\\n  In this paper we provide generic conditions on a graph class for the\\nexistence of an algorithm solving FVS in subexponential FPT time, i.e. time\\n$2^{k^\\\\varepsilon} \\\\mathop{\\\\rm poly}(n)$, for some $\\\\varepsilon<1$, where $n$\\ndenotes the number of vertices of the instance and $k$ the parameter. On the\\none hand this result unifies algorithms that have been proposed over the years\\nfor several graph classes such as planar graphs, map graphs, unit-disk graphs,\\npseudo-disk graphs, and string graphs of bounded edge-degree. On the other hand\\nit extends the tractability horizon of FVS to new classes that are not amenable\\nto previously used techniques, in particular intersection graphs of ``thin''\\nobjects like segment graphs or more generally $s$-string graphs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T16:12:52Z\"}"}
