{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00300v1\", \"title\": \"Magnetized Accretion onto Neutron Stars: from Photon-trapped to\\n  Neutrino-cooled Flows\", \"summary\": \"When a neutron star (NS) intercepts gas from a non-degenerate star, e.g., in\\na tidal disruption event, a common-envelope phase, or the collapsing core of a\\nmassive star, photons become trapped in the hot flow around the NS. This gas\\nforms a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) until the density and\\ntemperature close to the NS surface grow large enough for binding energy to be\\nconverted to neutrinos. Here we present three-dimensional,\\ngeneral-relativistic, magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion onto a\\nnon-rotating, unmagnetized NS. These connect, for the first time, an extended\\naccretion disk with a self-consistent hydrostatic atmosphere around the star.\\nThe impact of different seed magnetic fields and accretion rates is studied by\\napproximating the radiation-pressure dominated flow as an ideal gas with an\\nadiabatic index of $4/3$, coupled to a variable neutrino emissivity. At low\\naccretion rates, the hydrostatic atmosphere shows slow rotation and weak\\nmagnetization, transitioning to an outer RIAF structure. A toroidal magnetic\\nfield mediates the inward flow of energy and angular momentum through the\\natmosphere, which reaches a steady state when neutrino emission balances the\\naccretion power. We develop a one-dimensional analytical model connecting these\\nresults with more general initial conditions and describing the main features\\nof the flow. Our results have implications for the spin and mass evolution of\\nhypercritically accreting NSs.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T04:44:24Z\"}"}
