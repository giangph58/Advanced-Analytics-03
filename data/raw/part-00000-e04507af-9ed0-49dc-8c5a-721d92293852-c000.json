{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05137v1\", \"title\": \"Research on Anomaly Detection Methods Based on Diffusion Models\", \"summary\": \"Anomaly detection is a fundamental task in machine learning and data mining,\\nwith significant applications in cybersecurity, industrial fault diagnosis, and\\nclinical disease monitoring. Traditional methods, such as statistical modeling\\nand machine learning-based approaches, often face challenges in handling\\ncomplex, high-dimensional data distributions. In this study, we explore the\\npotential of diffusion models for anomaly detection, proposing a novel\\nframework that leverages the strengths of diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs)\\nto effectively identify anomalies in both image and audio data. The proposed\\nmethod models the distribution of normal data through a diffusion process and\\nreconstructs input data via reverse diffusion, using a combination of\\nreconstruction errors and semantic discrepancies as anomaly indicators. To\\nenhance the framework's performance, we introduce multi-scale feature\\nextraction, attention mechanisms, and wavelet-domain representations, enabling\\nthe model to capture fine-grained structures and global dependencies in the\\ndata. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MVTec AD and\\nUrbanSound8K, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly\\ndetection techniques, achieving superior accuracy and robustness across diverse\\ndata modalities. This research highlights the effectiveness of diffusion models\\nin anomaly detection and provides a robust and efficient solution for\\nreal-world applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T11:19:08Z\"}"}
