This\\npseudospin-momentum locking also governs the quantum geometric properties (such\\nas the Berry phase and Berry curvature) of Dirac particles. In the present\\nwork, we demonstrate that a domain wall separating two regions with distinct\\nquantum geometric properties can serve as an alternative to potential barriers.\\nSpecifically, using the three-band $\\\\alpha-T_3$ model of two-dimensional Dirac\\nparticles, we show that a Berry phase domain wall results in partial reflection\\nand transmission of the Dirac particles, despite the fact that the incident and\\nrefracted momenta are identical.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T11:08:30Z\"}"}
