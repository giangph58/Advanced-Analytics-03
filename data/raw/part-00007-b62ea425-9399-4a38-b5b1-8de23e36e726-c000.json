{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05415v1\", \"title\": \"Radial Profiles of Radio Halos in Massive Galaxy Clusters: Diffuse\\n  Giants Over 2 Mpc\", \"summary\": \"We present new, high frequency radio observations of the merging galaxy\\nclusters PLCK G287.0+32.9, Abell 2744, and Bullet. These clusters are known to\\nhost $\\\\sim$Mpc scale sources, known as radio halos, which are formed by the\\nacceleration of cosmic rays by turbulence injected into the intracluster medium\\nduring cluster mergers. Our new images reveal previously undetected faint\\noutermost regions of halos, extending to over 2 Mpc. This discovery highlights\\nthe presence of radio halos with large extents at high frequencies and suggests\\nthat their observable size depends on a combination of the observation\\nsensitivity and uv-coverage, and their radio power. We additionally compare the\\nproperties of these three clusters with MACS J0717+3745 and Abell 2142, both of\\nwhich are known to host prominent large radio halos. Remarkably, all five\\nhalos, despite their exceptionally large extents, exhibit properties similar to\\nother classical halos: their radial profiles are described by a\\nsingle-component exponential fit, they show radial spectral index steepening,\\nand have an average radio emissivity of about $10^{-42}\\\\,\\n\\\\mathrm{erg\\\\,s^{-1}\\\\,cm^{-3}\\\\,Hz^{-1}}$. Our results demonstrate that radio\\nhalos can extend to the cluster periphery, without the transition to an\\nobservationally distinguishable different halo component in the outermost\\nregions. Our findings highlight that careful subtraction of unrelated sources\\nembedded in the halo is necessary to measure the radio surface brightness\\naccurately, as incomplete subtraction can introduce an apparent secondary\\ncomponent in the peripheral regions.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T16:56:22Z\"}"}
