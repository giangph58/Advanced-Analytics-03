To address this challenge, this paper first\\nextracts a set of moral meta-principles derived from existing moral experiments\\nand well-established social science theories, aiming to capture widely\\nrecognized and common-sense moral values for ADSs. These meta-principles are\\nthen formalized as quantitative moral metamorphic relations, which act as the\\ntest oracle. Furthermore, we propose a metamorphic testing framework to\\nsystematically identify potential moral issues. Finally, we illustrate the\\nimplementation of the framework and present typical violation cases using the\\nVIRES VTD simulator and its built-in ADS.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T16:29:58Z\"}"}
