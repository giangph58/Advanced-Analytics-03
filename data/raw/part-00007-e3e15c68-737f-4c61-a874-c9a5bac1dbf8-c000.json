{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06244v1\", \"title\": \"The distinction between Ice phases VII, VIII and X\", \"summary\": \"Ice phases VII, VIII and X are all based on a body-centered cubic arrangement\\nof molecules, the differences coming from molecular orientation. There is some\\ndebate as to whether these should even be considered distinct phases. The\\nstandard definition of a transition between distinct phases involves a\\ndiscontinuity in any derivative of the free energy. This can be hard to prove\\nexperimentally, and most previous theoretical works have been based on models\\nwhich either have continuously differentiable free energies, or no\\nstraightforward way to determine the free energy. Here we build a free energy\\nmodel based on the common definitions of the phases ; ordered ice-VIII,\\norientationally disordered ice VII and proton-disordered ice X. All transitions\\nin this model might or might not be associated with a discontinuity in the\\nspecific heat, depending on paramaterization. By comparing with data, we find\\nthat a VII-X transition line exists, but it ends in a critical point hidden\\nwithin the stability field of phase VIII. If the model is correct, there is a\\ndiscontinuity between VII and X, so they are separate phases. We propose that\\nthe hidden phase boundary might be demonstrated experimentally by compression\\nof supercooled ice VII.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T17:43:42Z\"}"}
