Applications\\nhave so far been limited to systems composed of spherical particles, however,\\nwhereas most real-world supercooled liquids are molecular. We here introduce a\\nsimple size-polydisperse molecular model that allows for efficient thermal\\nequilibration \\\\textit{in silico} with the Swap Monte Carlo method, resulting in\\nan estimated speedup of $10^3-10^6$ at moderate polydispersity (5-10 %).\\nDespite being polydisperse, the model exhibits little difference between the\\nsize-resolved orientational time-autocorrelation functions. Our results\\ndemonstrate the possibility of designing molecular models that can be simulated\\nclose to the calorimetric glass transition.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T17:13:36Z\"}"}
