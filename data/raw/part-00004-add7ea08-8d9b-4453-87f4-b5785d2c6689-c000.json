{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15991v1\", \"title\": \"Efficient Adaptation of Deep Neural Networks for Semantic Segmentation\\n  in Space Applications\", \"summary\": \"In recent years, the application of Deep Learning techniques has shown\\nremarkable success in various computer vision tasks, paving the way for their\\ndeployment in extraterrestrial exploration. Transfer learning has emerged as a\\npowerful strategy for addressing the scarcity of labeled data in these novel\\nenvironments. This paper represents one of the first efforts in evaluating the\\nfeasibility of employing adapters toward efficient transfer learning for rock\\nsegmentation in extraterrestrial landscapes, mainly focusing on lunar and\\nmartian terrains. Our work suggests that the use of adapters, strategically\\nintegrated into a pre-trained backbone model, can be successful in reducing\\nboth bandwidth and memory requirements for the target extraterrestrial device.\\nIn this study, we considered two memory-saving strategies: layer fusion (to\\nreduce to zero the inference overhead) and an ``adapter ranking'' (to also\\nreduce the transmission cost). Finally, we evaluate these results in terms of\\ntask performance, memory, and computation on embedded devices, evidencing\\ntrade-offs that open the road to more research in the field.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T15:53:59Z\"}"}
