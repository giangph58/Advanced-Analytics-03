To tackle these challenges, methodologies from the field of\\nself-adaptive systems enabling these systems to react to unforeseen\\ncircumstances during runtime have been applied. The Monitoring-Analysis-\\nPlanning-Execution over Knowledge (MAPE-K) feedback loop model is a popular\\napproach, often implemented in a managing subsystem, responsible for monitoring\\nand adapting a managed subsystem. This work explores the implementation of the\\nMAPE- K feedback loop based on Behavior Trees (BTs) within the Robot Operating\\nSystem 2 (ROS2) framework. By delineating the managed and managing subsystems,\\nour approach enhances the flexibility and adaptability of ROS-based systems,\\nensuring they not only meet Quality-of-Service (QoS), but also system health\\nmetric requirements, namely availability of ROS nodes and communication\\nchannels. Our implementation allows for the application of the method to new\\nmanaged subsystems without needing custom BT nodes as the desired behavior can\\nbe configured within a specific rule set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\\nour method through various experiments on a system showcasing an aerial\\nperception use case. By evaluating different failure cases, we show both an\\nincreased perception quality and a higher system availability.
