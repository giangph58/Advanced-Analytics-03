{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20712v1\", \"title\": \"On three-dimensional ${\\\\cal N}=4$ supersymmetry: maximally\\n  supersymmetric backgrounds and massive deformations\", \"summary\": \"Using the $SO ({\\\\cal N})$ superspace formulation for $\\\\cal N$-extended\\nconformal supergravity in three dimensions, we derive all maximally\\nsupersymmetric backgrounds in the ${\\\\cal N} =4$ case. The specific feature of\\nthis choice is that the so-called super Cotton tensor $X^{IJKL} = X^{[IJKL]}$,\\nwhich exists for ${\\\\cal N} \\\\geq 4$, is equivalent to the scalar $X$ defined by\\n$X^{IJKL} = \\\\varepsilon^{IJKL} X$. This scalar may be used as a deformation\\nparameter. In the family of $(p,q)$ anti-de Sitter (AdS) superspaces with\\n$p+q=4$, it is known that $X\\\\neq 0$ exists only if $p=4$ and $q=0$. In general,\\nthe $(4,0)$ AdS superspaces are characterised by the structure group\\n$SL(2,{\\\\mathbb R}) \\\\times SO (4)$ and their geometry is determined by two\\nconstant parameters, $S$ and $X$, of which the former determines the AdS\\ncurvature, while the $R$-symmetry curvature is determined by the parameters\\n$(X+2S)$ and $(X-2S)$ in the left and right sectors of $SU(2)_{\\\\rm L} \\\\times\\nSU(2)_{\\\\rm R}$, respectively. Setting $S=0$ leads to the so-called deformed\\n${\\\\cal N}=4$ Minkowski superspace ${\\\\mathbb M}^{3|8}_X$ introduced thirteen\\nyears ago. We construct general interacting supersymmetric field theories in\\n${\\\\mathbb M}^{3|8}_X$ and demonstrate that they originate as massive\\ndeformations of the following two families of ${\\\\cal N} =4$ theories in\\nstandard Minkowski superspace ${\\\\mathbb M}^{3|8}$: (i) ${\\\\cal N}=4$\\nsuperconformal field theories; and (ii) ${\\\\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric gauge\\ntheories in ${\\\\mathbb M}^{3|8}$ which are not superconformal but possess the\\n$R$-symmetry group $SU(2)_{\\\\rm L} \\\\times SU(2)_{\\\\rm R}$. Extensions of the\\ntheories in (ii) to ${\\\\mathbb M}^{3|8}_X$ necessarily contain Chern-Simons\\nterms at the component level. We also demonstrate the generation of\\ntopologically massive ${\\\\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric gauge theories from radiative\\ncorrections in the hypermultiplet sector.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T12:43:42Z\"}"}
