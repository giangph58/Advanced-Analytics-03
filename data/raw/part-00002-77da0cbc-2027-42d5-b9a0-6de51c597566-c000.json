Since these problems are NP-hard,\\neffective optimizers are needed to handle them. The knowledge about variable\\ndependencies allows for proposing such tools. However, in this work, we\\nconsider a real-world multi-objective problem for which standard variable\\ndependency discovery techniques are inapplicable. Therefore, using\\nlinkage-based variation operators is unreachable. To address this issue, we\\npropose a definition of problem-dedicated variable dependency. On this base, we\\npropose obtaining masks of dependent variables. Using them, we construct three\\nnovel crossover operators. The results concerning real-world test cases show\\nthat introducing our propositions into two well-known optimizers (NSGA-II,\\nMOEA/D) dedicated to multi-objective optimization significantly improves their\\neffectiveness.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T09:06:55Z\"}"}
