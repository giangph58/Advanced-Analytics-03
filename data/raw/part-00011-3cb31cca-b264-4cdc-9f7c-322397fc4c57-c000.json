We observe that commutativity allows for elegant results.\\nWe note that these algebras generalise multicomplex spaces - we show that a\\ncommutative analogue of Clifford algebra are either isomorphic to a\\nmulticomplex space or to `multi split-complex space' (space defined just like\\nmulticomplex numbers but uses split-complex numbers instead of complex\\nnumbers). We do a general study of commutative analogues of Clifford algebras\\nand use tools like operations of conjugation and idempotents to give a tensor\\nproduct decomposition and a direct sum decomposition for them. Tensor product\\ndecomposition follows relatively easily from the definition. For the direct sum\\ndecomposition, we give explicit basis using new techniques.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RA\", \"categories\": \"math.RA,math.AC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T13:01:44Z\"}"}
