{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04920v1\", \"title\": \"The k-Sudoku Number of Graphs\", \"summary\": \"Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph of order $n$ with chromatic number $\\\\chi(G)$. Let $\\nk \\\\geq \\\\chi(G) $ and $S \\\\subseteq V$. Let $ C_0 $ be a $k$-coloring of the\\ninduced subgraph $ G[S] $. The coloring $C_0$ is called an extendable coloring,\\nif $C_0$ can be extended to a $k$-coloring of $G$ and it is a $k$- Sudoku\\ncoloring of $G$, if $C_0$ can be uniquely extended to a $k$-coloring of $G$.\\nThe smallest order of such an induced subgraph $G[S]$ of $G$ which admits a\\n$k$- Sudoku coloring is called $k$- Sudoku number of $G$ and is denoted by\\n$sn(G,k)$. When $k=\\\\chi(G)$, we call $k$- Sudoku number of $G$ as Sudoku number\\nof $G$ and is denoted by $sn(G)$. In this paper, we have obtained the $3$-\\nSudoku number of some bipartite graphs $P_n$, $C_{2n}$, $K_{m,n}$, $B_{m,n}$\\nand $G \\\\circ lK_1$, where $G$ is a bipartite graph and $l\\\\geq1$. Also, we have\\nobtained the necessary and sufficient conditions for a bipartite graph $G$ to\\nhave $sn(G,3)$ equal to $n$, $n-1$ or $n-2$. Also, we study the relation\\nbetween $k$- Sudoku number of a graph $G$ and the Sudoku number of a supergraph\\n$H$ of $G$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T03:30:27Z\"}"}
