{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11167v1\", \"title\": \"Low-Rank SPIKE Framework for Solving Large Sparse Linear Systems with\\n  Applications\", \"summary\": \"The SPIKE family of linear system solvers provides parallelism using a block\\ntridiagonal partitioning. Typically SPIKE-based solvers are applied to banded\\nsystems, resulting in structured off-diagonal blocks with non-zeros elements\\nrestricted to relatively small submatrices comprising the band of the original\\nmatrix. In this work, a low-rank SVD based approximation of the off-diagonal\\nblocks is investigated. This produces a representation which more effectively\\nhandles matrices with large, sparse bands. A set of flexible distributed\\nsolvers, the LR-SPIKE variants, are implemented. There are applicable to a wide\\nrange of applications -- from use as a \\\"black-box\\\" preconditioner which\\nstraightforwardly improves upon the classic Block Jacobi preconditioner, to use\\nas a specialized \\\"approximate direct solver.\\\" An investigation of the\\neffectiveness of the new preconditioners for a selection of SuiteSparse\\nmatrices is performed, particularly focusing on matrices derived from 3D finite\\nelement simulations. In addition, the SPIKE approximate linear system solvers\\nare also paired with the FEAST eigenvalue solver, where they are shown to be\\nparticularly effective due to the former's rapid convergence, and the latter's\\nacceptance of loose linear system solver convergence, resulting in a\\ncombination which requires very few solver iterations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.MS,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T13:15:00Z\"}"}
