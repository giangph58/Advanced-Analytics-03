This paper presents a novel Small Language Model(SLM)-driven\\nsystem that synergizes advancements in lightweight Retrieval-Augmented\\nGeneration (RAG) and semantic-aware data structuring to enable efficient,\\naccurate, and scalable query resolution across diverse data formats. By\\nintegrating MiniRAG's semantic-aware heterogeneous graph indexing and\\ntopology-enhanced retrieval with SLM-powered structured data extraction, our\\nsystem addresses the limitations of traditional methods in handling\\nMulti-Entity Question Answering (Multi-Entity QA) and complex semantic queries.\\nExperimental results demonstrate superior performance in accuracy and\\nefficiency, while the introduction of semantic entropy as an unsupervised\\nevaluation metric provides robust insights into model uncertainty. This work\\npioneers a cost-effective, domain-agnostic solution for next-generation\\ndatabase systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DB\", \"categories\": \"cs.DB,cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T03:28:03Z\"}"}
