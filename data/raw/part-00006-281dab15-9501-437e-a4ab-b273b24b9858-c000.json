The\\nwell-studied Euclidean Barrett-Crane model provides an excellent setting for\\ntesting analytical and numerical tools to probe spinfoam models. We explore a\\ndata-driven approach to accelerating spinfoam computations by showing that the\\nvertex amplitude is an object that can be learned from data using deep\\nlearning. We divide the learning process into a classification and a regression\\ntask: Two networks are independently engineered to decide whether the amplitude\\nis zero or not and to predict the precise numerical value, respectively. The\\ntrained networks are tested with several accuracy measures. The classifier in\\nparticular demonstrates robust generalisation far outside the training domain,\\nwhile the regressor demonstrates high predictive accuracy in the domain it is\\ntrained on. We discuss limitations, possible improvements, and implications for\\nfuture work.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T07:34:58Z\"}"}
