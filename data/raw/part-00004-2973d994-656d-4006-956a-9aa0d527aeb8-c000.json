{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10128v1\", \"title\": \"Probing Binary Lens Caustics with Gravitational Waves: A Uniform\\n  Approximation Approach\", \"summary\": \"We present a new framework for modeling gravitational wave diffraction near\\nfold caustics using the Uniform Approximation (UA), focusing on binary mass\\nlenses-axially asymmetric systems with complex caustic structures. Full-wave\\nmethods based on the Kirchhoff integral become impractical in this regime due\\nto highly oscillatory integrands. The UA provides a robust and accurate\\ndescription of the wave field near folds, resolving the breakdown of\\nGeometrical Optics at caustics and improving upon Transitional\\nAsymptotics-based on Airy function approximations-which lack global validity.\\nCentral to our approach is the concept of the caustic width, $d_c$, a\\ncharacteristic length scale defining the region where diffraction significantly\\nalters wave propagation. We find that $d_c$ scales universally with the\\ngravitational wavelength as ~ $ \\\\lambda^{2/3}$ and inversely with the\\nredshifted lens mass as ~ $ M_{Lz}^{-2/3}$. The wave amplification near the\\nfold grows as ~ $ d_c^{-1/4}$, substantially enhancing the signal and\\npotentially playing a key role in the detection of gravitational waves lensed\\nnear caustics. Notably, for lens masses below the galactic scale, the caustic\\nwidth for gravitational waves is not negligible compared to the Einstein\\nradius-as it is in electromagnetic lensing-making the UA essential for\\naccurately capturing wave effects.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T11:36:36Z\"}"}
