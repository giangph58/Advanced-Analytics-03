We propose an innovative demodulation reference signal\\nscheme that achieves up to an 8x reduction in overhead by implementing a\\ndelay-domain sparsity constraint on the precoder. Furthermore, we present a\\ndeep neural network (DNN)-based end-to-end architecture that integrates a\\npropagation channel estimation module, a precoder design module, and an\\neffective channel estimation module. Additionally, we propose a Bayesian\\nmodel-assisted training framework that incorporates domain knowledge, resulting\\nin an interpretable datapath design. Simulation results demonstrate that our\\nproposed solution significantly outperforms various baseline schemes while\\nexhibiting substantially lower computational complexity.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:54:19Z\"}"}
