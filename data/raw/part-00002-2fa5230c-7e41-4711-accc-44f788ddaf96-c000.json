For linear difference equations with constant\\ncoefficients, we establish explicit functional equations linking the generating\\nseries to the initial data, and for equations with polynomial coefficients, we\\nintroduce an analogue of Stanley's \\\\( D \\\\)-finiteness criterion, proving that a\\ndiscrete generating series is \\\\( D \\\\)-finite if and only if the corresponding\\nsequence is polynomially recursive. The framework is further generalized to\\nmultidimensional settings, where we investigate the interplay between discrete\\ngenerating series and solutions to Cauchy problems for difference equations.\\nKey structural properties are uncovered through the introduction of polynomial\\nshift operators and projection techniques. The theory is illustrated with\\nconcrete examples, including the Tribonacci recurrence and Schr\\\\\\\"oder's second\\nproblem.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CA\", \"categories\": \"math.CA,math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T15:08:16Z\"}"}
