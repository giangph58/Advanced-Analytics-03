{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15986v1\", \"title\": \"Charting the Uncharted: The Landscape of Monero Peer-to-Peer Network\", \"summary\": \"The Monero blockchain enables anonymous transactions through advanced\\ncryptography in its peer-to-peer network, which underpins decentralization,\\nsecurity, and trustless interactions. However, privacy measures obscure peer\\nconnections, complicating network analysis. This study proposes a method to\\ninfer peer connections in Monero's latest protocol version, where timestamp\\ndata is unavailable. We collect peerlist data from TCP flows, validate our\\ninference algorithm, and map the network structure. Our results show high\\naccuracy, improving with longer observation periods. This work is the first to\\nreveal connectivity patterns in Monero's updated protocol, providing\\nvisualizations and insights into its topology. Our findings enhance the\\nunderstanding of Monero's P2P network, including the role of supernodes, and\\nhighlight potential protocol and security improvements.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T15:42:31Z\"}"}
