{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20495v1\", \"title\": \"A Family of Self-Dual Quasicrystals with Critical Phases\", \"summary\": \"We propose a general framework for constructing self-dual one-dimensional\\nquasiperiodic lattice models with arbitrary-range hoppings and multifractal\\nbehaviors. Our framework generates a broad spectrum of quasicrystals, ranging\\nfrom the off-diagonal Aubry-Andr\\\\'e-Harper models on one end, to those with\\nlong-range power-law hoppings on another. Focusing on models with off-diagonal\\nquasiperiodic hoppings with power-law decay, we exploit the fact that, when the\\nself-dual condition is satisfied, the system must be in the critical state with\\nmultifractal properties. This enables the engineering of models with competing\\nextended, critical, and localized phases, with rich mobility edges in between.\\nAs an outstanding example, we show that a limiting case of our family of\\nself-dual quasicrystals can be implemented using Rydberg-atom arrays. Our work\\noffers a systematic route toward self-duality and critical phases, and would\\nfacilitate their experimental simulation.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T07:37:42Z\"}"}
