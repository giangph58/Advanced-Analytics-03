However, as wireless systems become\\nincreasingly complex, the demands for computation and communication resources\\nin semantic communications continue to grow rapidly. This paper investigates\\nthe trade-off between computation and communication in wireless semantic\\ncommunications, taking into consideration transmission task delay and\\nperformance constraints within the semantic communication framework. We propose\\na novel tradeoff metric to analyze the balance between computation and\\ncommunication in semantic transmissions and employ the deep reinforcement\\nlearning (DRL) algorithm to minimize this metric, thereby reducing the cost\\nassociated with balancing computation and communication. Through simulations,\\nwe analyze the tradeoff between computation and communication and demonstrate\\nthe effectiveness of optimizing this trade-off metric.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:06:20Z\"}"}
