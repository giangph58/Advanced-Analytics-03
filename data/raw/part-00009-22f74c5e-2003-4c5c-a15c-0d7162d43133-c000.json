These Feynman integrals also contribute to Higgs or\\n$Z$-boson production in association with a top pair. We employ the method of\\ndifferential equations (DEs), facilitated by the use of finite field methods to\\nhandle the algebraic complexity stemming from the seven-scale kinematics. The\\npresence of the top quark in the virtual propagators, in addition to the mass\\nof the external $W$ boson, gives rise to nested square roots and three elliptic\\ncurves. We obtain DEs that depend at most quadratically on the dimensional\\nregulator $\\\\epsilon$ for sectors where these analytic structures appear, and\\nare $\\\\epsilon$-factorised otherwise. We express the DEs in terms of a minimal\\nset of differential one-forms, separating the logarithmic ones. We solve the\\nDEs numerically in the physical kinematic region, with the method of\\ngeneralised power series expansions.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T15:17:35Z\"}"}
