However, inferring the EOS from observations of NSs is a\\ncomputationally challenging task. In this work, we efficiently solve this\\ninverse problem by leveraging differential programming in two ways. First, we\\nenable full Bayesian inference in under one hour of wall time on a GPU by using\\ngradient-based samplers, without requiring pre-trained machine learning\\nemulators. Moreover, we demonstrate efficient scaling to high-dimensional\\nparameter spaces. Second, we introduce a novel gradient-based optimization\\nscheme that recovers the EOS of a given NS mass-radius curve. We demonstrate\\nhow our framework can reveal consistencies or tensions between nuclear physics\\nand astrophysics. First, we show how the breakdown density of a metamodel\\ndescription of the EOS can be determined from NS observations. Second, we\\ndemonstrate how degeneracies in EOS modeling using nuclear empirical parameters\\ncan influence the inverse problem during gradient-based optimization. Looking\\nahead, our approach opens up new theoretical studies of the relation between NS\\nproperties and the EOS, while effectively tackling the data analysis challenges\\nbrought by future detectors.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.IM,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T13:35:22Z\"}"}
