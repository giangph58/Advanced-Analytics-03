Analysis based on the Fermi surface band\\ncurvatures points to quasiparticle coherence in momentum positions with\\ndominant $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital character. Our findings establish the symmetry\\nchannels and the active role of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals involved in the density\\nwave formation, offering important insight into the electronic and magnetic\\ncorrelations in the nickelate.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T09:05:26Z\"}"}
