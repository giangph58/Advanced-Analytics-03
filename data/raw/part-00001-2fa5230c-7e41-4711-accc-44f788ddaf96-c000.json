Recent advances in\\nshortest path-biased BP routing (SP-BP) mitigate shortcomings such as slow\\nstartup and random walk, but exclusive link-level commodity selection still\\nsuffers from the last-packet problem and bandwidth underutilization. Moreover,\\nclassic BP routing implicitly assumes single-input-single-output (SISO)\\ntransceivers, which can lead to the same packets being scheduled on multiple\\noutgoing links for multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) transceivers, causing\\ndetouring and looping in MIMO networks. In this paper, we revisit the\\nfoundational Lyapunov drift theory underlying BP routing and demonstrate that\\nexclusive commodity selection is unnecessary, and instead propose a Max-Utility\\nlink-sharing method. Additionally, we generalize MaxWeight scheduling to MIMO\\nnetworks by introducing attributed capacity hypergraphs (ACH), an extension of\\ntraditional conflict graphs for SISO networks, and by incorporating backlog\\nreassignment into scheduling iterations to prevent redundant packet routing.\\nNumerical evaluations show that our approach substantially mitigates the\\nlast-packet problem in state-of-the-art (SOTA) SP-BP under lightweight traffic,\\nand slightly expands the network capacity region for heavier traffic.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI,cs.SY,eess.SP,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T15:06:44Z\"}"}
