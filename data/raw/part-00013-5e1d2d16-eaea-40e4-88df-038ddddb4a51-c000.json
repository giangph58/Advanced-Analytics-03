This study proposes a data-driven framework that\\nintegrates high-resolution noise measurements from airport monitoring terminals\\nwith mobile phone-derived de facto population estimates to evaluate noise\\nexposure with fine spatio-temporal resolution. We develop hourly noise exposure\\nprofiles and quantify the number of individuals affected across regions and\\ntime windows, using both absolute counts and inequality metrics such as Gini\\ncoefficients. This enables a nuanced examination of not only who is exposed,\\nbut when and where the burden is concentrated. At our case study airport,\\noperational runway patterns resulted in recurring spatial shifts in noise\\nexposure. By incorporating de facto population data, we demonstrate that\\nidentical noise operations can yield unequal impacts depending on the time and\\nlocation of population presence, highlighting the importance of accounting for\\npopulation dynamics in exposure assessment. Our approach offers a scalable\\nbasis for designing population-sensitive noise abatement strategies,\\ncontributing to more equitable and transparent aviation noise management.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP,stat.OT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T06:15:43Z\"}"}
