Culture is inherently synesthetic, enriched by all\\nsenses within a shared time and space. In an optimal synesthetic setting,\\npeople of all abilities can connect meaningfully; when one sense is\\ncompromised, other channels can be enhanced to compensate. This is the power of\\nmultimodality. Digital technology is increasingly able to capture aspects of\\nmultimodality. To document multimodality aspects of cultural practices and\\nproducts for the long-term remains a challenge. Many artistic products from the\\nperforming arts tend to be multimodal, and are often immersive, so only a\\nmultimodal repository can offer a platform for this work. To our knowledge\\nthere is no single, comprehensive repository with a knowledge base to serve\\narts and disability. By knowledge base, we mean classifications, taxonomies, or\\nontologies (in short, knowledge organisation systems). This paper presents\\ninnovative ways to develop a knowledge base which capture multimodal features\\nof archived representations of cultural assets, but also indicate various forms\\nhow to interact with them including machine-readable description. We will\\ndemonstrate how back-end and front-end applications, in a combined effort, can\\nsupport accessible archiving and data management for complex digital objects\\nborn out of artistic practices and make them available for wider audiences.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DL\", \"categories\": \"cs.DL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:33:12Z\"}"}
