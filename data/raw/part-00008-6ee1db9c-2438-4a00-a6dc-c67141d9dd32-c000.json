{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12173v1\", \"title\": \"Computational Exploration of Inclined Magnetic Fields and Variable\\n  Thermal Flux Effects on the Flow of Dusty Hybrid Nanofluid around\\n  Stretching/Shrinking Wedge\", \"summary\": \"This extensive investigation explores the influence of inclined magnetic\\nfields and radiative non-linear heat flux on the behavior of dusty hybrid\\nnanofluids over stretching/shrinking wedges. Employing $Cu$-$SiO_2$ as a hybrid\\nnanoparticle composition and ethylene glycol $(EG)$ as the base liquid, the\\nstudy investigates the fluid's response to a uniform magnetic field. The\\ngoverning partial differential equations and associated boundary conditions are\\nadeptly transformed into ordinary differential equations using appropriate\\ntransformations and then non-dimensionalized. Numerical simulations are\\nexecuted using MATLAB and the bvp-4c solver. The outcomes offer a profound\\ninsight into thermofluid dynamics in industrial applications featuring\\nintricate fluid flows, evaluating the influence of magnetic parameters on\\ndiverse fluid types, including nanofluids and dusty hybrid nanofluids.\\nFurthermore, the investigation analyzes the impact of heat production and\\nabsorption on both vertical and horizontal plates, studying the significance of\\nthe velocity ratio factor in relation to the drag coefficient and local Nusselt\\nnumber under thermal conditions of generation and absorption.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T15:25:46Z\"}"}
