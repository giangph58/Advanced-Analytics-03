Motivated by an autonomous building application,\\nwe formulate a privacy preservation problem for statistical inputs in linear\\ntime-invariant systems. What makes this problem widely applicable is that the\\ninputs, rather than being assumed to be deterministic, follow a probability\\ndistribution, inherently embedding privacy-sensitive information that requires\\nprotection. This formulation also presents a technical challenge as\\nconventional differential privacy mechanisms are not directly applicable.\\nThrough rigorous analysis, we develop strategy to achieve $(0, \\\\delta)$\\ndifferential privacy through adding noise. Finally, the effectiveness of our\\nmethods is demonstrated by revisiting the autonomous building application.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T09:54:09Z\"}"}
