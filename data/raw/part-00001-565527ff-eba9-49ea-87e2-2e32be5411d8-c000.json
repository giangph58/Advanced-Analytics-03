However, the\\ngeometric deformation in deformed tables causes a weak correlation between\\ncontent information and structure, resulting in downstream tasks not being able\\nto obtain accurate content information. To obtain fine-grained spatial\\ncoordinates of cells, we propose the OG-HFYOLO model, which enhances the edge\\nresponse by Gradient Orientation-aware Extractor, combines a Heterogeneous\\nKernel Cross Fusion module and a scale-aware loss function to adapt to\\nmulti-scale objective features, and introduces mask-driven non-maximal\\nsuppression in the post-processing, which replaces the traditional bounding box\\nsuppression mechanism. Furthermore, we also propose a data generator, filling\\nthe gap in the dataset for fine-grained deformation table cell spatial\\ncoordinate localization, and derive a large-scale dataset named Deformation\\nWired Table (DWTAL). Experiments show that our proposed model demonstrates\\nexcellent segmentation accuracy on all mainstream instance segmentation models.\\nThe dataset and the source code are open source:\\nhttps://github.com/justliulong/OGHFYOLO.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T12:02:01Z\"}"}
