We show that the\\ninfluence of uniaxial stress is strongly doping dependent: the\\nquasi-two-dimensional CDW is enhanced by in-plane uniaxial stress in a wide\\nhole doping range ($0.45 \\\\leq x \\\\leq 0.80$), but only barely affected in the\\nmost underdoped and optimally doped samples ($x = 0.40$ and 0.93), where the\\nCDW correlation length is minimal. A stress-induced three-dimensionally\\nlong-range ordered (3D) CDW was observed only in YBCO$_{6.50}$ and\\nYBCO$_{6.67}$. The temperature dependence of the 3D CDW clearly indicates a\\nstrong competition with superconductivity. Based on the systematic strain-,\\ndoping-, and temperature-dependent REXS measurements reported here, we discuss\\nthe relationship between charge order and superconductivity in YBCO$_{6+x}$ and\\nother cuprates.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T13:05:31Z\"}"}
