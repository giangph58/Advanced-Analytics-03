Still, bounding the initial value of the\\nclock remains a challenge, which determines the initial condition of the\\nalgorithm and thereby its number of iterations. In this letter, we propose a\\nnew incremental error algorithm for clock skew compensation, called direct\\nsearch, which no longer relies on the bounds on the initial value of the clock.\\nThe numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can\\nsignificantly reduce the number of iterations in comparison to the prior work\\nwhile eliminating the effect of floating-point precision loss on clock skew\\ncompensation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T11:48:49Z\"}"}
