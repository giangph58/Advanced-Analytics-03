In the testing phase, they\\nidentify patterns that deviate from this normal distribution as 'anomalies'. To\\nlearn the `normal' distribution, prevailing methods corrupt the images and\\ntrain a model to reconstruct them. During testing, the model attempts to\\nreconstruct corrupted inputs based on the learned 'normal' distribution.\\nDeviations from this distribution lead to high reconstruction errors, which\\nindicate potential anomalies. However, corrupting an input image inevitably\\ncauses information loss even in normal regions, leading to suboptimal\\nreconstruction and an increased risk of false positives. To alleviate this, we\\npropose IterMask3D, an iterative spatial mask-refining strategy designed for 3D\\nbrain MRI. We iteratively spatially mask areas of the image as corruption and\\nreconstruct them, then shrink the mask based on reconstruction error. This\\nprocess iteratively unmasks 'normal' areas to the model, whose information\\nfurther guides reconstruction of 'normal' patterns under the mask to be\\nreconstructed accurately, reducing false positives. In addition, to achieve\\nbetter reconstruction performance, we also propose using high-frequency image\\ncontent as additional structural information to guide the reconstruction of the\\nmasked area. Extensive experiments on the detection of both synthetic and\\nreal-world imaging artifacts, as well as segmentation of various pathological\\nlesions across multiple MRI sequences, consistently demonstrate the\\neffectiveness of our proposed method.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T10:41:23Z\"}"}
