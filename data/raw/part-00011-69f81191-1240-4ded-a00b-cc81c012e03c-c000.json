{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02250v1\", \"title\": \"Designing Effective Human-Swarm Interaction Interfaces: Insights from a\\n  User Study on Task Performance\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we present a systematic method of design for human-swarm\\ninteraction interfaces, combining theoretical insights with empirical\\nevaluation. We first derive ten design principles from existing literature,\\napply them to key information dimensions identified through goal-directed task\\nanalysis and developed a tablet-based interface for a target search task. We\\nthen conducted a user study with 31 participants where humans were required to\\nguide a robotic swarm to a target in the presence of three types of hazards\\nthat pose a risk to the robots: Distributed, Moving, and Spreading. Performance\\nwas measured based on the proximity of the robots to the target and the number\\nof deactivated robots at the end of the task. Results indicate that at least\\none robot was bought closer to the target in 98% of tasks, demonstrating the\\ninterface's success fulfilling the primary objective of the task. Additionally,\\nin nearly 67% of tasks, more than 50% of the robots reached the target.\\nMoreover, particularly better performance was noted in moving hazards.\\nAdditionally, the interface appeared to help minimize robot deactivation, as\\nevidenced by nearly 94% of tasks where participants managed to keep more than\\n50% of the robots active, ensuring that most of the swarm remained operational.\\nHowever, its effectiveness varied across hazards, with robot deactivation being\\nlowest in distributed hazard scenarios, suggesting that the interface provided\\nthe most support in these conditions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T03:38:13Z\"}"}
