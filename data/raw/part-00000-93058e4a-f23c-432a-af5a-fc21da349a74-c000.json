Although the inverse Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial may\\nnot always have only real roots, we conjecture that the Hadamard product of an\\ninverse Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial of degree $n$ and $(1+t)^n$ has only real\\nroots. Using interlacing polynomials and multiplier sequences, we confirm this\\nconjecture for paving matroids. This result allows us to confirm the\\nlog-concavity conjecture for these matroids by applying Newton's inequalities.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T13:58:07Z\"}"}
