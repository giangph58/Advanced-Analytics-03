In this study, we train a model using unsupervised learning to identify\\nvulnerabilities in the Solidity source code of Ethereum smart contracts. To\\naddress the challenges associated with real-world smart contracts, our training\\ndata is derived from actual vulnerability samples obtained from datasets such\\nas SmartBugs Curated and the SolidiFI Benchmark. These datasets enable us to\\ndevelop a robust unsupervised static analysis method for detecting five\\nspecific vulnerabilities: Reentrancy, Access Control, Timestamp Dependency,\\ntx.origin, and Unchecked Low-Level Calls. We employ clustering algorithms to\\nidentify outliers, which are subsequently classified as vulnerable smart\\ncontracts.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T08:36:21Z\"}"}
