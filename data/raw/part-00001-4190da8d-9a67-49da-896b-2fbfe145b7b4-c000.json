Traditionally, symbolic regression has been implemented\\nprimarily through genetic programming that evolves populations of candidate\\nsolutions sampled by genetic operators, crossover and mutation. More recently,\\nneural networks have been employed to learn the entire analytical model, i.e.,\\nits structure and coefficients, using regularized gradient-based optimization.\\nAlthough this approach tunes the model's coefficients better, it is prone to\\npremature convergence to suboptimal model structures. Here, we propose a\\nneuro-evolutionary symbolic regression method that combines the strengths of\\nevolutionary-based search for optimal neural network (NN) topologies with\\ngradient-based tuning of the network's parameters. Due to the inherent high\\ncomputational demand of evolutionary algorithms, it is not feasible to learn\\nthe parameters of every candidate NN topology to full convergence. Thus, our\\nmethod employs a memory-based strategy and population perturbations to enhance\\nexploitation and reduce the risk of being trapped in suboptimal NNs. In this\\nway, each NN topology can be trained using only a short sequence of\\nbackpropagation iterations. The proposed method was experimentally evaluated on\\nthree real-world test problems and has been shown to outperform other NN-based\\napproaches regarding the quality of the models obtained.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NE\", \"categories\": \"cs.NE,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T08:29:53Z\"}"}
