{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12937v1\", \"title\": \"Palatini Linear Attractors Are Back in ACTion\", \"summary\": \"Recent results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) indicate a scalar\\nspectral index $n_s \\\\simeq 0.9743$, in excellent agreement with the prediction\\nof linear inflation. However, the corresponding tensor-to-scalar ratio $r\\n\\\\simeq 0.0667$ is in tension with current observational bounds. In this work,\\nwe investigate how this tension can be alleviated in the Palatini formulation\\nof gravity. We consider two classes of models based on simple monomial\\npotentials: (i) models with a non-minimal coupling between the inflaton and\\ngravity, and (ii) models including an $\\\\alpha R^2$ term. In the first case, we\\nfind that a quadratic potential with a linear non-minimal coupling leads to the\\nlinear inflation attractor, with $r$ suppressed as $\\\\xi$ increases. In the\\nsecond case, we show that a linear potential can yield values of $r$ consistent\\nwith observations for sufficiently large $\\\\alpha$. Our results demonstrate that\\nsimple monomial models can remain compatible with current observational\\nconstraints when embedded in the Palatini framework.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.CO,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T13:35:17Z\"}"}
