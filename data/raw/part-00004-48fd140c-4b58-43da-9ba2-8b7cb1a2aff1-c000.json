{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17547v1\", \"title\": \"A Comprehensive Survey of Knowledge-Based Vision Question Answering\\n  Systems: The Lifecycle of Knowledge in Visual Reasoning Task\", \"summary\": \"Knowledge-based Vision Question Answering (KB-VQA) extends general Vision\\nQuestion Answering (VQA) by not only requiring the understanding of visual and\\ntextual inputs but also extensive range of knowledge, enabling significant\\nadvancements across various real-world applications. KB-VQA introduces unique\\nchallenges, including the alignment of heterogeneous information from diverse\\nmodalities and sources, the retrieval of relevant knowledge from noisy or\\nlarge-scale repositories, and the execution of complex reasoning to infer\\nanswers from the combined context. With the advancement of Large Language\\nModels (LLMs), KB-VQA systems have also undergone a notable transformation,\\nwhere LLMs serve as powerful knowledge repositories, retrieval-augmented\\ngenerators and strong reasoners. Despite substantial progress, no comprehensive\\nsurvey currently exists that systematically organizes and reviews the existing\\nKB-VQA methods. This survey aims to fill this gap by establishing a structured\\ntaxonomy of KB-VQA approaches, and categorizing the systems into main stages:\\nknowledge representation, knowledge retrieval, and knowledge reasoning. By\\nexploring various knowledge integration techniques and identifying persistent\\nchallenges, this work also outlines promising future research directions,\\nproviding a foundation for advancing KB-VQA models and their applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.IR,cs.MM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T13:37:25Z\"}"}
