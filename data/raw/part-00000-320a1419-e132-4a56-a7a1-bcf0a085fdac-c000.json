For the past decades, object detection has yielded promising\\nresults using neural networks on various datasets. While many methods focus on\\nperformance metrics, few projects focus on improving the robustness of these\\ndetection and tracking pipelines, notably to sensor failures. In this paper we\\nattempt to address this issue by creating a realistic synthetic data\\naugmentation pipeline for camera-radar Autonomous Vehicle (AV) datasets. Our\\ngoal is to accurately simulate sensor failures and data deterioration due to\\nreal-world interferences. We also present our results of a baseline lightweight\\nNoise Recognition neural network trained and tested on our augmented dataset,\\nreaching an overall recognition accuracy of 54.4\\\\% on 11 categories across\\n10086 images and 2145 radar point-clouds.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI,eess.IV,eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T15:15:50Z\"}"}
