A Fermi surface with\\nreduced symmetry is intimately tied to unusual transport properties such as\\nanomalous Hall effect and nonlinear Hall effect. Here, combining theoretical\\ncalculations and transport measurements, we report the discovery of a new class\\nof bulk Fermi surface structure with unprecedented low symmetry, the ``Fermi\\nlune\\\", with peculiar crescent shaped Fermi energy contours, in rhombohedral\\nmultilayer graphene. This emergent Fermi-lune structure driven by\\nelectron-electron interactions spontaneously breaks time-reversal, mirror, and\\nrotational symmetries, leading to two distinctive phenomena: giant intrinsic\\nnon-reciprocity in longitudinal transport and a new type of magnetism termed\\n``transdimensional orbital magnetism\\\". Coupling the Fermi lune to a\\nsuperlattice potential further produces a novel Chern insulator exhibiting\\nquantized anomalous Hall effect controlled by in-plane magnetic field. Our work\\nunveils a new symmetry breaking state of matter in the transdimensional regime,\\nwhich opens an avenue for exploring correlated and topological quantum\\nphenomena in symmetry breaking phases.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T16:55:29Z\"}"}
