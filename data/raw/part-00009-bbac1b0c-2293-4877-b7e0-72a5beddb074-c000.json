Initial-state models based on the Color\\nGlass Condensate framework generate only short-range correlations, while PYTHIA\\nsimulations implemented with the string-shoving mechanism also fail to describe\\nthese ultra-long-range correlations. The results challenge existing paradigms\\nand question the underlying mechanisms in low-multiplicity pp and p-Pb\\ncollisions. The findings impose significant constraints on models describing\\ncollective phenomena in small collision systems and advance the understanding\\nof origin of long-range correlations at Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energies.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-ex\", \"categories\": \"nucl-ex,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T07:46:09Z\"}"}
