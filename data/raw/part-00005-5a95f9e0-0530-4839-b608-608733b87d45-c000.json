Using the B-spline\\nexpansion, we compute the wavefunctions in coordinate space and estimate the\\noscillator strengths. The symmetry properties of the states and the\\nnon-separability of the wavefunctions are illustrated. Wavefunctions associated\\nwith resonances above the scattering threshold, in particular those of bound\\nstates in the continuum as well as their partner states, are also given.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T16:09:51Z\"}"}
