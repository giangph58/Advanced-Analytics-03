{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04097v1\", \"title\": \"3D Brain MRI Classification for Alzheimer Diagnosis Using CNN with Data\\n  Augmentation\", \"summary\": \"A three-dimensional convolutional neural network was developed to classify\\nT1-weighted brain MRI scans as healthy or Alzheimer. The network comprises 3D\\nconvolution, pooling, batch normalization, dense ReLU layers, and a sigmoid\\noutput. Using stochastic noise injection and five-fold cross-validation, the\\nmodel achieved test set accuracy of 0.912 and area under the ROC curve of\\n0.961, an improvement of approximately 0.027 over resizing alone. Sensitivity\\nand specificity both exceeded 0.90. These results align with prior work\\nreporting up to 0.10 gain via synthetic augmentation. The findings demonstrate\\nthe effectiveness of simple augmentation for 3D MRI classification and motivate\\nfuture exploration of advanced augmentation methods and architectures such as\\n3D U-Net and vision transformers.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T03:32:25Z\"}"}
