The presence of such elements\\ndominates the accompanying kilonova emission over the first few days and has\\nbeen identified in the AT2017gfo event, associated with the gravitational wave\\ndetection GW170817.\\n  Abundance calculations based on over 17000 simulated trajectories describing\\nthe evolution of matter properties in the merger outflows show that the new\\ndata lead to an increase of 50-70 percent in the abundance of Y, Zr, Nb, and\\nMo. This enhancement is large compared to the scatter of relative abundances\\nobserved in old very metal-poor stars and is therefore significant in the\\ncomparison with other possible astrophysical processes contributing to\\nlight-element production.\\n  These results underline the importance of including experimental decay data\\nfor very neutron-rich beta-delayed neutron emitters into r-process models.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-ex\", \"categories\": \"nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:16:41Z\"}"}
