Through theoretical modeling, we demonstrate that the anisotropic\\ndielectric function in semi-Dirac\\n  materials play a critical role in determining the magnitude and polarity of\\nthese optical displacements. Further more, by utilizing the unidirectional\\ndrift of massless Dirac electrons in Semi-Dirac materials, we systematically\\n  reveal how the drift velocity and direction modulate the behavior of optical\\ndisplacements. The results indicate\\n  that semi-Dirac materials provide a versatile platform for controlling\\nspin-dependent photonic phenomena with\\n  their material anisotropy and carrier transport. This work opens a new avenue\\nfor designing advanced photonic\\n  devices with tunable optical responses, particularly with significant\\napplication potential in quantum information\\n  processing and topological photonics.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T10:48:19Z\"}"}
