{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04165v1\", \"title\": \"TS-SNN: Temporal Shift Module for Spiking Neural Networks\", \"summary\": \"Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are increasingly recognized for their\\nbiological plausibility and energy efficiency, positioning them as strong\\nalternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in neuromorphic computing\\napplications. SNNs inherently process temporal information by leveraging the\\nprecise timing of spikes, but balancing temporal feature utilization with low\\nenergy consumption remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce Temporal\\nShift module for Spiking Neural Networks (TS-SNN), which incorporates a novel\\nTemporal Shift (TS) module to integrate past, present, and future spike\\nfeatures within a single timestep via a simple yet effective shift operation. A\\nresidual combination method prevents information loss by integrating shifted\\nand original features. The TS module is lightweight, requiring only one\\nadditional learnable parameter, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing\\narchitectures with minimal additional computational cost. TS-SNN achieves\\nstate-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like CIFAR-10 (96.72\\\\%), CIFAR-100\\n(80.28\\\\%), and ImageNet (70.61\\\\%) with fewer timesteps, while maintaining low\\nenergy consumption. This work marks a significant step forward in developing\\nefficient and accurate SNN architectures.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NE\", \"categories\": \"cs.NE,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T06:34:34Z\"}"}
