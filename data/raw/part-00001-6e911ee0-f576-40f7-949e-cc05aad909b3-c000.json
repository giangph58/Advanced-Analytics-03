The\\nstudy is made tractable by focusing on states that are spatially homogeneous,\\ntime-independent, and scale-invariant. Such states, in which mode $k$ has\\noccupation numbers $n_k \\\\sim k^{-\\\\gamma}$, are well known in nonlinear physics.\\nRG flow in such states is qualitatively different from that in the vacuum -- a\\npositive $\\\\gamma$ decreases the dimension of an operator, turning marginal\\ninteractions into relevant interactions. We compute one-loop beta functions.\\nDepending on the sign of the beta function, backreaction may either cause a\\nminor shift of the state in the IR, or completely change the nature of the\\nstate. Focusing on nearly marginal interactions, we construct an analog of the\\nepsilon expansion and IR fixed points, with epsilon now set by the scaling of\\nthe interaction rather than the spacetime dimension. In the language of RG\\nflow, critical-balance scaling -- which has applications in fields as varied as\\nastrophysics and ocean waves -- corresponds to the state dynamically adjusting\\nitself along the RG flow until the interaction becomes marginal.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T17:43:01Z\"}"}
