In this article the Change State Space Model is\\nintroduced, that has been specifically designed for change detection by\\nfocusing on the relevant changes between bi-temporal images, effectively\\nfiltering out irrelevant information. By concentrating solely on the changed\\nfeatures, the number of network parameters is reduced, enhancing significantly\\ncomputational efficiency while maintaining high detection performance and\\nrobustness against input degradation. The proposed model has been evaluated via\\nthree benchmark datasets, where it outperformed ConvNets, ViTs, and Mamba-based\\ncounterparts at a fraction of their computational complexity. The\\nimplementation will be made available at https://github.com/Elman295/CSSM upon\\nacceptance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T11:25:10Z\"}"}
