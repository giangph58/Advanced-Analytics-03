{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14888v1\", \"title\": \"WMKA-Net: A Weighted Multi-Kernel Attention NetworkMethod for Retinal\\n  Vessel Segmentation\", \"summary\": \"We propose a novel retinal vessel segmentation network, the Weighted\\nMulti-Kernel Attention Network (WMKA-Net), which aims to address the issues of\\ninsufficient multiscale feature capture, loss of contextual information, and\\nnoise sensitivity in retinal vessel segmentation. WMKA-Net significantly\\nimproves the segmentation performance of small vessels and low-contrast regions\\nby integrating several innovative components, including the MultiKernelFeature\\nFusion Module (MKDC), the Progressive Feature Weighting Fusion Strategy (UDFF),\\nand the Attention Mechanism Module (AttentionBlock). The MKDC module employs\\nmultiscale parallel convolutional kernels to extract vessel characteristics,\\nthereby enhancing the ability to capture complex vascular structures. The UDFF\\nstrategy optimizes the transmission of feature information by weighted fusion\\nof high- and low-level features. The AttentionBlock highlights key regions and\\nsuppresses noise interference through the attention mechanism. Experimental\\nresults demonstrate that WMKA-Net achieves excellent segmentation performance\\nin multiple public datasets, particularly in segmentation of small vessels and\\nprocessing of pathological regions. This work provides a robust and efficient\\nnew method for segmentation of the retinal vessel.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T06:32:25Z\"}"}
