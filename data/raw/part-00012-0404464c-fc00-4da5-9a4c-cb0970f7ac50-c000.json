{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19714v1\", \"title\": \"Fast numerical evaluation of dark matter direct detection event rates\", \"summary\": \"The mathematical expression for the dark matter nuclear recoil event rate in\\na detector consists of a six dimensional integral over the velocity\\ndistribution of dark matter in the detector frame, and over the recoil momentum\\nof the nucleus. While a significant part of this integral can be solved in\\nclosed form under traditional assumptions of the standard halo model and/or\\nisotropic detector response, analysis of alternate assumptions is\\nconventionally impeded by the inefficiency of multidimensional numerical\\nintegration methods. In this work we introduce a novel, fast and efficient\\nalgorithm for direct detection event rate computations. This algorithm takes\\nadvantage of a closed form expression for the Radon transform of three\\ndimensional Zernike functions, which are used as basis functions for the\\nvelocity distribution. We demonstrate an implementation of this algorithm\\nZebraDM (https://github.com/sebsassi/zebradm), which is typically faster than\\nan optimized numerical integration approach by a factor between $10^2$ and\\n$10^4$.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T12:08:17Z\"}"}
