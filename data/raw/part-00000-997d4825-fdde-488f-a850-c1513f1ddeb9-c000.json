{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04199v1\", \"title\": \"Enhanced SCanNet with CBAM and Dice Loss for Semantic Change Detection\", \"summary\": \"Semantic Change Detection (SCD) in remote sensing imagery requires accurately\\nidentifying land-cover changes across multi-temporal image pairs. Despite\\nsubstantial advancements, including the introduction of transformer-based\\narchitectures, current SCD models continue to struggle with challenges such as\\nnoisy inputs, subtle class boundaries, and significant class imbalance. In this\\nstudy, we propose enhancing the Semantic Change Network (SCanNet) by\\nintegrating the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and employing Dice\\nloss during training. CBAM sequentially applies channel attention to highlight\\nfeature maps with the most meaningful content, followed by spatial attention to\\npinpoint critical regions within these maps. This sequential approach ensures\\nprecise suppression of irrelevant features and spatial noise, resulting in more\\naccurate and robust detection performance compared to attention mechanisms that\\napply both processes simultaneously or independently. Dice loss, designed\\nexplicitly for handling class imbalance, further boosts sensitivity to minority\\nchange classes. Quantitative experiments conducted on the SECOND dataset\\ndemonstrate consistent improvements. Qualitative analysis confirms these\\nimprovements, showing clearer segmentation boundaries and more accurate\\nrecovery of small-change regions. These findings highlight the effectiveness of\\nattention mechanisms and Dice loss in improving feature representation and\\naddressing class imbalance in semantic change detection tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T07:54:03Z\"}"}
