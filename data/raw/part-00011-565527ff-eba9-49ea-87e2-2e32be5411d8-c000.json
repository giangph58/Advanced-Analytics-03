Villada-Balbuena et al., Soft Matter, 2022, 18,\\n4699-4714]. Here we investigate many facets of the dynamical properties of the\\nsystem, such as confined and inhomogeneous diffusion, mean first-passage times\\nand generalized incoherent scattering functions. We observe that the experiment\\nfeatures strong footprints of the confinement in the dynamical properties, such\\nas inhomogeneous diffusion coefficients and non-zero off-diagonal elements in\\nthe incoherent scattering function which we can quantitatively model and\\nanalyze with computer simulations. This allows us, for example, to\\nsystematically investigate the impact of surface roughness. Our comparative\\nstudy therefore advances the fundamental understanding of the impact of\\nconfinement on dynamics in fluids and colloidal suspensions.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T12:18:09Z\"}"}
