{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10880v1\", \"title\": \"Safe-Construct: Redefining Construction Safety Violation Recognition as\\n  3D Multi-View Engagement Task\", \"summary\": \"Recognizing safety violations in construction environments is critical yet\\nremains underexplored in computer vision. Existing models predominantly rely on\\n2D object detection, which fails to capture the complexities of real-world\\nviolations due to: (i) an oversimplified task formulation treating violation\\nrecognition merely as object detection, (ii) inadequate validation under\\nrealistic conditions, (iii) absence of standardized baselines, and (iv) limited\\nscalability from the unavailability of synthetic dataset generators for diverse\\nconstruction scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce\\nSafe-Construct, the first framework that reformulates violation recognition as\\na 3D multi-view engagement task, leveraging scene-level worker-object context\\nand 3D spatial understanding. We also propose the Synthetic Indoor Construction\\nSite Generator (SICSG) to create diverse, scalable training data, overcoming\\ndata limitations. Safe-Construct achieves a 7.6% improvement over\\nstate-of-the-art methods across four violation types. We rigorously evaluate\\nour approach in near-realistic settings, incorporating four violations, four\\nworkers, 14 objects, and challenging conditions like occlusions (worker-object,\\nworker-worker) and variable illumination (back-lighting, overexposure,\\nsunlight). By integrating 3D multi-view spatial understanding and synthetic\\ndata generation, Safe-Construct sets a new benchmark for scalable and robust\\nsafety monitoring in high-risk industries.
