Half of the 6,000 workers in the study received access to a\\ngenerative AI tool integrated into the applications they already used for\\nemails, document creation, and meetings. We find that access to the AI tool\\nduring the first year of its release primarily impacted behaviors that could be\\nchanged independently and not behaviors that required coordination to change:\\nworkers who used the tool spent 3 fewer hours, or 25% less time on email each\\nweek (intent to treat estimate is 1.4 hours) and seemed to complete documents\\nmoderately faster, but did not significantly change time spent in meetings.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,cs.LG,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T17:52:00Z\"}"}
