{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00321v1\", \"title\": \"Edge Large AI Models: Revolutionizing 6G Networks\", \"summary\": \"Large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) possess human-like abilities to\\nsolve a wide range of real-world problems, exemplifying the potential of\\nexperts in various domains and modalities. By leveraging the communication and\\ncomputation capabilities of geographically dispersed edge devices, edge LAM\\nemerges as an enabling technology to empower the delivery of various real-time\\nintelligent services in 6G. Unlike traditional edge artificial intelligence\\n(AI) that primarily supports a single task using small models, edge LAM is\\nfeatured by the need of the decomposition and distributed deployment of large\\nmodels, and the ability to support highly generalized and diverse tasks.\\nHowever, due to limited communication, computation, and storage resources over\\nwireless networks, the vast number of trainable neurons and the substantial\\ncommunication overhead pose a formidable hurdle to the practical deployment of\\nedge LAMs. In this paper, we investigate the opportunities and challenges of\\nedge LAMs from the perspectives of model decomposition and resource management.\\nSpecifically, we propose collaborative fine-tuning and full-parameter training\\nframeworks, alongside a microservice-assisted inference architecture, to\\nenhance the deployment of edge LAM over wireless networks. Additionally, we\\ninvestigate the application of edge LAM in air-interface designs, focusing on\\nchannel prediction and beamforming. These innovative frameworks and\\napplications offer valuable insights and solutions for advancing 6G technology.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI,cs.LG,eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T05:44:00Z\"}"}
