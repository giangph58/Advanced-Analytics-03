To address this constraint, we propose Spatial-Frequency\\nMasked Image Modeling (SFMIM), a self-supervised pretraining strategy for\\nhyperspectral data that utilizes the large portion of unlabeled data. Our\\nmethod introduces a novel dual-domain masking mechanism that operates in both\\nspatial and frequency domains. The input HSI cube is initially divided into\\nnon-overlapping patches along the spatial dimension, with each patch comprising\\nthe entire spectrum of its corresponding spatial location. In spatial masking,\\nwe randomly mask selected patches and train the model to reconstruct the masked\\ninputs using the visible patches. Concurrently, in frequency masking, we remove\\nportions of the frequency components of the input spectra and predict the\\nmissing frequencies. By learning to reconstruct these masked components, the\\ntransformer-based encoder captures higher-order spectral-spatial correlations.\\nWe evaluate our approach on three publicly available HSI classification\\nbenchmarks and demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art performance.\\nNotably, our model shows rapid convergence during fine-tuning, highlighting the\\nefficiency of our pretraining strategy.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T06:24:21Z\"}"}
