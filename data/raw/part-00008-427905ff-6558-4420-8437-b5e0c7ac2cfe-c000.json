{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04541v1\", \"title\": \"On the sensitivity of different ensemble filters to the type of\\n  assimilated observation networks\", \"summary\": \"Recent advances in data assimilation (DA) have focused on developing more\\nflexible approaches that can better accommodate nonlinearities in models and\\nobservations. However, it remains unclear how the performance of these advanced\\nmethods depends on the observation network characteristics. In this study, we\\npresent initial experiments with the surface quasi-geostrophic model, in which\\nwe compare a recently developed AI-based ensemble filter with the standard\\nLocal Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF). Our results show that the\\nanalysis solutions respond differently to the number, spatial distribution, and\\nnonlinear fraction of assimilated observations. We also find notable changes in\\nthe multiscale characteristics of the analysis errors. Given that standard DA\\ntechniques will be eventually replaced by more advanced methods, we hope this\\nstudy sets the ground for future efforts to reassess the value of Earth\\nobservation systems in the context of newly emerging algorithms.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ao-ph,nlin.CD,stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T16:23:22Z\"}"}
