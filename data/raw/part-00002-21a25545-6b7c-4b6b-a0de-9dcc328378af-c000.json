{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14943v1\", \"title\": \"Cloud-cloud collision and star formation in G013.313+0.193\", \"summary\": \"We study the G013.313+0.193 G013.313 region, a complex environment\\ncharacterized by molecular cloud interactions indicative of cloud-cloud\\ncollision (CCC). Observations of the NH3(1,1) and (2,2) inversion transitions\\nwere obtained using the Nanshan 26 m radio telescope, while HCO+ (1-0), 12CO,\\n13CO, and C18O(1-0) transitions from the Purple Mountain Observatory Delingha\\n14 m telescope. Archival data are also included. We identified key\\nobservational signatures of CCC, including complementary spatial distributions,\\nU-shaped structures, bridge features, and V-shaped velocity distributions. The\\nposition-velocity diagrams (P-V) reveal clear indications of gas interaction\\nbetween two velocity components, suggesting an ongoing collision at an\\nestimated angle of approximately 45 degree to the line of sight. The estimated\\ncollision timescale is 0.35-1.03 Myr, aligned with the inferred ages of young\\nstellar objects (YSOs) in the region, supporting the hypothesis of\\ncollision-induced star formation. Hub-filament system (HFS) are identified in\\nthe compressed gas region, where filaments converge toward a dense hub,\\nsuggesting the CCC as a potential driver of HFS formation and massive star\\nformation. The high column density suggests favorable conditions for the\\nformation of massive stars. Although alternative kinematic drivers such as\\nlongitudinal collapse and shear motion are considered, CCC remains the most\\nplausible explanation for the observed features. Our findings contribute to our\\nunderstanding of the mechanisms of cloud dynamics and massive star formation in\\nturbulent molecular environments.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.SR,A.0\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T08:06:55Z\"}"}
