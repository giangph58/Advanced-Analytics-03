{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00308v1\", \"title\": \"AI-Assisted Decision-Making for Clinical Assessment of Auto-Segmented\\n  Contour Quality\", \"summary\": \"Purpose: This study presents a Deep Learning (DL)-based quality assessment\\n(QA) approach for evaluating auto-generated contours (auto-contours) in\\nradiotherapy, with emphasis on Online Adaptive Radiotherapy (OART). Leveraging\\nBayesian Ordinal Classification (BOC) and calibrated uncertainty thresholds,\\nthe method enables confident QA predictions without relying on ground truth\\ncontours or extensive manual labeling. Methods: We developed a BOC model to\\nclassify auto-contour quality and quantify prediction uncertainty. A\\ncalibration step was used to optimize uncertainty thresholds that meet clinical\\naccuracy needs. The method was validated under three data scenarios: no manual\\nlabels, limited labels, and extensive labels. For rectum contours in prostate\\ncancer, we applied geometric surrogate labels when manual labels were absent,\\ntransfer learning when limited, and direct supervision when ample labels were\\navailable. Results: The BOC model delivered robust performance across all\\nscenarios. Fine-tuning with just 30 manual labels and calibrating with 34\\nsubjects yielded over 90% accuracy on test data. Using the calibrated\\nthreshold, over 93% of the auto-contours' qualities were accurately predicted\\nin over 98% of cases, reducing unnecessary manual reviews and highlighting\\ncases needing correction. Conclusion: The proposed QA model enhances contouring\\nefficiency in OART by reducing manual workload and enabling fast, informed\\nclinical decisions. Through uncertainty quantification, it ensures safer, more\\nreliable radiotherapy workflows.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI,stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T05:05:35Z\"}"}
