For each $a \\\\in N$, we consider the binary representation\\n$\\\\left( a_{i}\\\\right) _{i\\\\in -N }$ of $a$ with $a_{i}=0$ for nearly each $i$; we\\ndenote by $\\\\alpha _{n}(a)$ the number of integers $i$ such that $\\\\left( a_{i},\\n\\\\ldots ,a_{i+n} \\\\right) =s_{n}$. We consider the curve $C_{n}=\\\\left(\\nS_{n,k}\\\\right) _{k\\\\in N ^{\\\\ast }}$ which consists of consecutive segments of\\nlength $1$ such that, for each $k$, $S_{n,k+1}$ is obtained from $S_{n,k}$ by\\nturning right if $k+\\\\alpha _{n}(k)-\\\\alpha _{n}(k-1)$ is even and left\\notherwise. $C_{1}$ is self-avoiding since it is the curve associated to the\\nalternating folding sequence. In [1], M. Mend\\\\`es France and J. Shallit\\nconjectured that the curves $C_{n}$ for $n\\\\geq 2$ are also self-avoiding. In\\nthe present paper, we show that this property is true for $n=2$. We also prove\\nthat $C_{2}$ has some properties similar to those which were shown in [2], [3]\\nand [4] for folding curves.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:13:11Z\"}"}
