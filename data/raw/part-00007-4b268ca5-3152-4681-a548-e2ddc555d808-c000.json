{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09932v1\", \"title\": \"A Theory of Universal Rate-Distortion-Classification Representations for\\n  Lossy Compression\", \"summary\": \"In lossy compression, Blau and Michaeli [5] introduced the information\\nrate-distortion-perception (RDP) function, extending traditional\\nrate-distortion theory by incorporating perceptual quality. More recently, this\\nframework was expanded by defining the\\nrate-distortion-perception-classification (RDPC) function, integrating\\nmulti-task learning that jointly optimizes generative tasks such as perceptual\\nquality and classification accuracy alongside reconstruction tasks [28]. To\\nthat end, motivated by the concept of a universal RDP encoder introduced in\\n[34], we investigate universal representations that enable diverse\\ndistortion-classification tradeoffs through a single fixed encoder combined\\nwith multiple decoders. Specifically, theoretical analysis and numerical\\nexperiment demonstrate that for the Gaussian source under mean squared error\\n(MSE) distortion, the entire distortion-classification tradeoff region can be\\nachieved using one universal encoder. In addition, this paper characterizes\\nachievable distortion-classification regions for fixed universal\\nrepresentations in general source distributions, identifying conditions that\\nensure minimal distortion penalty when reusing encoders across varying tradeoff\\npoints. Experimental results using MNIST and SVHN datasets validate our\\ntheoretical insights, showing that universal encoders can obtain distortion\\nperformance comparable to task-specific encoders, thus supporting the\\npracticality and effectiveness of our proposed universal representations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T06:46:02Z\"}"}
