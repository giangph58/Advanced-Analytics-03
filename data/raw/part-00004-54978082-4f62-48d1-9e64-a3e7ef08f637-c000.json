More precisely, we consider\\ndomains that are unions of three half-planes, where each half-plane is\\nstratified in the direction orthogonal to its boundary. As for the well-known\\nRellich uniqueness theorem for a homogeneous exterior domain, our result does\\nnot require any boundary condition. Our proof is based on half-plane\\nrepresentations of the solution which are derived through a generalization of\\nthe Fourier transform adapted to stratified media. A byproduct of our result is\\nthe absence of trapped modes at the junction of open waveguides as soon as the\\nangles between branches are greater than $\\\\pi$/2.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T08:02:59Z\"}"}
