{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15635v1\", \"title\": \"Questioning Cosmic Acceleration with DESI: The Big Stall of the Universe\", \"summary\": \"One of the most important discoveries in modern cosmology is cosmic\\nacceleration. However, we find that today's universe could decelerate in the\\nstatistically preferred Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) scenario over the\\n$\\\\Lambda$CDM model by cosmic microwave background, type Ia supernova and DESI's\\nnew measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. Using various datasets, at a\\nbeyond $5\\\\,\\\\sigma$ confidence level, we demonstrate that the universe\\nexperiences a triple deceleration during its evolution and finally reaches the\\nstate of the ``Big Stall\\\", which predicts that: (i) the universe suddenly comes\\nto a halt in the distant future; (ii) its eventual destiny is dominated by dark\\nmatter rather than dark energy ; (iii) it ultimately retains an extremely small\\nfraction of dark energy but exerts an extremely large pressure. Our findings\\nprofoundly challenge the established understanding of cosmic acceleration and\\nenrich our comprehension of cosmic evolution.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.HE,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T06:55:43Z\"}"}
