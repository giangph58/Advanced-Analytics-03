{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16654v1\", \"title\": \"International Comparisons: Multilateral Indices and Nonparametric\\n  Welfare Bounds\", \"summary\": \"Multilateral index numbers, such as those used to make international\\ncomparisons of prices and income, are fundamental objects in economics.\\nHowever, these numbers are often challenging to interpret in terms of economic\\nwelfare as a data-dependent 'taste bias' can arise for these indices that\\ndistorts measurement of price and income levels and dispersion. To study this\\nproblem, I develop a means to appraise indices' economic interpretability using\\nnon-parametric bounds on a true cost-of-living index. These bounds improve upon\\ntheir classical counterparts, define a new class of indices, and can correct\\nexisting indices for preference misspecification. In my main application I\\napprise existing international comparison methods. I find that taste bias\\ngenerally leads to overestimates (underestimates) of price (income) levels.\\nSuperlative indices, such as the Fisher-GEKS index, lie within the permitted\\nbounds more frequently than non-superlative methods, but the mean size of this\\nbias is modest in all examined cases. My results can thus be interpreted as\\nsupporting the economic validity of the myriad multilateral methods which are\\nin practical use.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T12:22:12Z\"}"}
