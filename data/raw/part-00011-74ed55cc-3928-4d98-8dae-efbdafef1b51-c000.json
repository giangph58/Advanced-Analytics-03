{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23824v1\", \"title\": \"On the Reproducibility of Learned Sparse Retrieval Adaptations for Long\\n  Documents\", \"summary\": \"Document retrieval is one of the most challenging tasks in Information\\nRetrieval. It requires handling longer contexts, often resulting in higher\\nquery latency and increased computational overhead. Recently, Learned Sparse\\nRetrieval (LSR) has emerged as a promising approach to address these\\nchallenges. Some have proposed adapting the LSR approach to longer documents by\\naggregating segmented document using different post-hoc methods, including\\nn-grams and proximity scores, adjusting representations, and learning to\\nensemble all signals. In this study, we aim to reproduce and examine the\\nmechanisms of adapting LSR for long documents. Our reproducibility experiments\\nconfirmed the importance of specific segments, with the first segment\\nconsistently dominating document retrieval performance. Furthermore, We\\nre-evaluate recently proposed methods -- ExactSDM and SoftSDM -- across varying\\ndocument lengths, from short (up to 2 segments) to longer (3+ segments). We\\nalso designed multiple analyses to probe the reproduced methods and shed light\\non the impact of global information on adapting LSR to longer contexts. The\\ncomplete code and implementation for this project is available at:\\nhttps://github.com/lionisakis/Reproducibilitiy-lsr-long.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T08:19:31Z\"}"}
