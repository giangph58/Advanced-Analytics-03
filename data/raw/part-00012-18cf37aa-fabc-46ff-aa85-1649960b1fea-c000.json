{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11341v1\", \"title\": \"Evaluating DAO Sustainability and Longevity Through On-Chain Governance\\n  Metrics\", \"summary\": \"Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) automate governance and\\nresource allocation through smart contracts, aiming to shift decision-making to\\ndistributed token holders. However, many DAOs face sustainability challenges\\nlinked to limited user participation, concentrated voting power, and technical\\ndesign constraints. This paper addresses these issues by identifying research\\ngaps in DAO evaluation and introducing a framework of Key Performance\\nIndicators (KPIs) that capture governance efficiency, financial robustness,\\ndecentralisation, and community engagement. We apply the framework to a\\ncustom-built dataset of real-world DAOs constructed from on-chain data and\\nanalysed using non-parametric methods. The results reveal recurring governance\\npatterns, including low participation rates and high proposer concentration,\\nwhich may undermine long-term viability. The proposed KPIs offer a replicable,\\ndata-driven method for assessing DAO governance structures and identifying\\npotential areas for improvement. These findings support a multidimensional\\napproach to evaluating decentralised systems and provide practical tools for\\nresearchers and practitioners working to improve the resilience and\\neffectiveness of DAO-based governance models.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY,cs.ET,cs.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:13:20Z\"}"}
