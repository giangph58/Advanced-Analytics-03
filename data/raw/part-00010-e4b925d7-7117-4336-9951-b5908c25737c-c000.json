{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21310v1\", \"title\": \"Are Haicheng and Tangshan Earthquakes Dragon-Kings?\", \"summary\": \"We develop a data-driven framework to systematically test the dragon-king\\nearthquake hypothesis. Our method combines objective spatial clustering, based\\non data-adaptive kernel density estimation, with a high-power sequential\\noutlier detection technique. We apply this framework to seismicity surrounding\\nthe 1975 Haicheng mL 7.4 and 1976 Tangshan mL 7.9 earthquakes. For Haicheng,\\nthe mainshock shows a strong dragon-king signature in its pre-mainshock\\nsequence, with p-values between 0.03 and 0.07 across a stable range of density\\nthresholds used to define natural seismicity clusters. Post-mainshock and\\ncombined sequences yield slightly higher p-values (up to 0.09). In contrast,\\nTangshan's mainshock exhibits a weaker outlier signal before the event\\n(p-values in the range 0.05-0.15) but a stronger dragon-king signature\\nafterward, with p-values from 0.015 to 0.05. The evidence that the Haicheng and\\nTangshan mainshocks exhibit dragon-king characteristics supports the idea that\\nsome large and great earthquakes arise from a maturation process that may\\nenhance predictability.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.geo-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.geo-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T04:41:12Z\"}"}
