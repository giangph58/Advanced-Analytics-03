For the general\\ntime-varying case, a relationship between the error covariance and the\\nobservability Gramian is established. Utilizing this relationship, we\\ndemonstrate an intuition that the stability of a node is only related to the\\nobservability of those nodes that can reach it uniformly. For the periodic\\ntime-varying case, it is proved by a monotonicity analysis method that CI-based\\ndistributed Kalman filtering converges periodically for any initial condition.\\nThe convergent point is shown to be the unique positive definite solution to a\\nRiccati-like equation. Additionally, by constructing an intermediate difference\\nequation, the closed-loop transition matrix of the estimation error system is\\nproved to be Schur stable. Notably, all theoretical results are obtained\\nwithout requiring network connectivity assumptions. Finally, simulations verify\\nthe effectiveness of the stability results.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY,B.4\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T04:44:50Z\"}"}
