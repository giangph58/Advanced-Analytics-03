{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17761v1\", \"title\": \"Step1X-Edit: A Practical Framework for General Image Editing\", \"summary\": \"In recent years, image editing models have witnessed remarkable and rapid\\ndevelopment. The recent unveiling of cutting-edge multimodal models such as\\nGPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash has introduced highly promising image editing\\ncapabilities. These models demonstrate an impressive aptitude for fulfilling a\\nvast majority of user-driven editing requirements, marking a significant\\nadvancement in the field of image manipulation. However, there is still a large\\ngap between the open-source algorithm with these closed-source models. Thus, in\\nthis paper, we aim to release a state-of-the-art image editing model, called\\nStep1X-Edit, which can provide comparable performance against the closed-source\\nmodels like GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash. More specifically, we adopt the\\nMultimodal LLM to process the reference image and the user's editing\\ninstruction. A latent embedding has been extracted and integrated with a\\ndiffusion image decoder to obtain the target image. To train the model, we\\nbuild a data generation pipeline to produce a high-quality dataset. For\\nevaluation, we develop the GEdit-Bench, a novel benchmark rooted in real-world\\nuser instructions. Experimental results on GEdit-Bench demonstrate that\\nStep1X-Edit outperforms existing open-source baselines by a substantial margin\\nand approaches the performance of leading proprietary models, thereby making\\nsignificant contributions to the field of image editing.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T17:25:12Z\"}"}
