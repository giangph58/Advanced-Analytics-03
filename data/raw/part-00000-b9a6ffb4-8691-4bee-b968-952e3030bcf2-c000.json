{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05086v1\", \"title\": \"Group-Level Imitation May Stabilize Cooperation\", \"summary\": \"Stabilizing cooperation among self-interested individuals presents a\\nfundamental challenge in evolutionary theory and social science. While\\nclassical models predict the dominance of defection in social dilemmas,\\nempirical and theoretical studies have identified various mechanisms that\\npromote cooperation, including kin selection, reciprocity, and spatial\\nstructure. In this work, we investigate the role of localized imitation in the\\nevolutionary dynamics of cooperation within an optional Public Goods Game\\n(PGG). We introduce a model where individuals belong to distinct groups and\\nadapt their strategies based solely on comparisons within their own group. We\\nidentify different dynamical regimes, including stable fixed points, limit\\ncycles, and Rock-Scissors-Paper-type oscillations. Our analysis, grounded in a\\nreplicator-type framework, reveals that such group-level imitation can\\nstabilize cooperative behavior, provided that groups are not initially\\npolarized around a single strategy. In other words, restricting imitation to\\ngroup-level interactions mitigates the destabilizing effects of global\\ncompetition, providing a potential explanation for the resilience of\\ncooperation in structured populations.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph,cond-mat.stat-mech,econ.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:54:47Z\"}"}
