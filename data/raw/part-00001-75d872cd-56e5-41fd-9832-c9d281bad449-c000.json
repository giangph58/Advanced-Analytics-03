We provide\\nthree methods for simulating the Sibuya distribution. We also introduce the\\nSibuya-like sieved probability distributions, and apply them to numerical\\nfractional-order differentiation. Additionally, we use the Monte Carlo method\\nfor evaluating fractional-order integrals, and suggest the notion of the\\ncontinuous Sibuya probability distribution. The developed methods and tools are\\nillustrated by examples of computation. We provide the MATLAB toolboxes for\\nsimulation of the Sibuya probability distribution, and for the numerical\\nexamples.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T11:18:39Z\"}"}
