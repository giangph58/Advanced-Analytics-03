{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16528v1\", \"title\": \"Quantitative Strategy Templates\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents (permissive) \\\\emph{Quantitative Strategy Templates}\\n(QaSTels) to succinctly represent infinitely many winning strategies in\\ntwo-player energy and mean-payoff games. This transfers the recently introduced\\nconcept of \\\\emph{Permissive (qualitative) Strategy Templates} (PeSTels) for\\n$\\\\omega$-regular games to games with quantitative objectives. We provide the\\ntheoretical and algorithmic foundations of (i) QaSTel synthesis, and (ii) their\\n(incremental) combination with PeSTels for games with mixed quantitative and\\nqualitative objectives. Using a prototype implementation of our synthesis\\nalgorithms, we demonstrate empirically that QaSTels extend the advantageous\\nproperties of strategy templates over single winning strategies -- known from\\nPeSTels -- to games with (additional) quantitative objectives. This includes\\n(i) the enhanced robustness of strategies due to their runtime-adaptability,\\nand (ii) the compositionality of templates w.r.t. incrementally arriving\\nobjectives. We use control-inspired examples to illustrate these superior\\nproperties of QaSTels for CPS design.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GT\", \"categories\": \"cs.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T08:53:10Z\"}"}
