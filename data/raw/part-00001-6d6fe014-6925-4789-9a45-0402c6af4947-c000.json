To tackle these\\nchallenges, several methods have been proposed. Statistical methods demonstrate\\ninterpretability on the inferred parameters, but they are often limited in\\ntheir ability to handle complex scenes. Deep learning-based methods have shown\\nsuperior performance in terms of accuracy and robustness, but they lack\\ninterpretability or they are limited to a single-peak per pixel. In this paper,\\nwe propose a deep unrolling algorithm for dual-peak single-photon Lidar\\nimaging. We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian model for multiple targets and\\npropose a neural network that unrolls the underlying statistical method. To\\nsupport multiple targets, we adopt a dual depth maps representation and exploit\\ngeometric deep learning to extract features from the point cloud. The proposed\\nmethod takes advantages of statistical methods and learning-based methods in\\nterms of accuracy and quantifying uncertainty. The experimental results on\\nsynthetic and real data demonstrate the competitive performance when compared\\nto existing methods, while also providing uncertainty information.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T10:57:26Z\"}"}
