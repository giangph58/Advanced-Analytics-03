However,\\nchallenges still persist in generating complex motions and interactions. To\\naddress these challenges, we introduce ReVision, a plug-and-play framework that\\nexplicitly integrates parameterized 3D physical knowledge into a pretrained\\nconditional video generation model, significantly enhancing its ability to\\ngenerate high-quality videos with complex motion and interactions.\\nSpecifically, ReVision consists of three stages. First, a video diffusion model\\nis used to generate a coarse video. Next, we extract a set of 2D and 3D\\nfeatures from the coarse video to construct a 3D object-centric representation,\\nwhich is then refined by our proposed parameterized physical prior model to\\nproduce an accurate 3D motion sequence. Finally, this refined motion sequence\\nis fed back into the same video diffusion model as additional conditioning,\\nenabling the generation of motion-consistent videos, even in scenarios\\ninvolving complex actions and interactions. We validate the effectiveness of\\nour approach on Stable Video Diffusion, where ReVision significantly improves\\nmotion fidelity and coherence. Remarkably, with only 1.5B parameters, it even\\noutperforms a state-of-the-art video generation model with over 13B parameters\\non complex video generation by a substantial margin. Our results suggest that,\\nby incorporating 3D physical knowledge, even a relatively small video diffusion\\nmodel can generate complex motions and interactions with greater realism and\\ncontrollability, offering a promising solution for physically plausible video\\ngeneration.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:59:56Z\"}"}
