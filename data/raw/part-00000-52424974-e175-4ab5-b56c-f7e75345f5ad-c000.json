{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05062v1\", \"title\": \"LDGNet: A Lightweight Difference Guiding Network for Remote Sensing\\n  Change Detection\", \"summary\": \"With the rapid advancement of deep learning, the field of change detection\\n(CD) in remote sensing imagery has achieved remarkable progress. Existing\\nchange detection methods primarily focus on achieving higher accuracy with\\nincreased computational costs and parameter sizes, leaving development of\\nlightweight methods for rapid real-world processing an underexplored challenge.\\nTo address this challenge, we propose a Lightweight Difference Guiding Network\\n(LDGNet), leveraging absolute difference image to guide optical remote sensing\\nchange detection. First, to enhance the feature representation capability of\\nthe lightweight backbone network, we propose the Difference Guiding Module\\n(DGM), which leverages multi-scale features extracted from the absolute\\ndifference image to progressively influence the original image encoder at each\\nlayer, thereby reinforcing feature extraction. Second, we propose the\\nDifference-Aware Dynamic Fusion (DADF) module with Visual State Space Model\\n(VSSM) for lightweight long-range dependency modeling. The module first uses\\nfeature absolute differences to guide VSSM's global contextual modeling of\\nchange regions, then employs difference attention to dynamically fuse these\\nlong-range features with feature differences, enhancing change semantics while\\nsuppressing noise and background. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets\\ndemonstrate that our method achieves comparable or superior performance to\\ncurrent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods requiring several times more\\ncomputation, while maintaining only 3.43M parameters and 1.12G FLOPs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:33:54Z\"}"}
