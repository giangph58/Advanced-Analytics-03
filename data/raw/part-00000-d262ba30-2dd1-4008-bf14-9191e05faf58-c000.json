We exploit the latter to derive bounds on the distribution of\\nthe facet numbers. Using duality, we get bounds on the typical degree\\ndistributions of $\\\\beta$- and $\\\\beta'$-Delaunay triangulations. For\\n$\\\\beta'$-Delaunay, the resulting exponential lower bound seems to be the first\\nof its kind for random spatial graphs arising as the skeletons of random\\ntessellations. For $\\\\beta$-Delaunay, matching super-exponential bounds allow us\\nto show concentration of the maximal degree in a growing window to only a\\nfinite number of deterministic values (in particular, only two values for\\n$d=2$).\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T12:50:40Z\"}"}
