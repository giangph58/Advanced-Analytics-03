{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05121v1\", \"title\": \"Error Analysis of Deep PDE Solvers for Option Pricing\", \"summary\": \"Option pricing often requires solving partial differential equations (PDEs).\\nAlthough deep learning-based PDE solvers have recently emerged as quick\\nsolutions to this problem, their empirical and quantitative accuracy remain not\\nwell understood, hindering their real-world applicability. In this research,\\nour aim is to offer actionable insights into the utility of deep PDE solvers\\nfor practical option pricing implementation. Through comparative experiments in\\nboth the Black--Scholes and the Heston model, we assess the empirical\\nperformance of two neural network algorithms to solve PDEs: the Deep Galerkin\\nMethod and the Time Deep Gradient Flow method (TDGF). We determine their\\nempirical convergence rates and training time as functions of (i) the number of\\nsampling stages, (ii) the number of samples, (iii) the number of layers, and\\n(iv) the number of nodes per layer. For the TDGF, we also consider the order of\\nthe discretization scheme and the number of time steps.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.CP\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.CP,cs.LG,q-fin.MF\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T10:45:59Z\"}"}
