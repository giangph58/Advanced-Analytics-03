We demonstrate the significance of\\ncurved Bregman divergences with two examples: (1) symmetrized Bregman\\ndivergences and (2) the Kullback-Leibler divergence between circular complex\\nnormal distributions. We then consider monotonic embeddings to define\\nrepresentational curved Bregman divergences and show that the\\n$\\\\alpha$-divergences are representational curved Bregman divergences with\\nrespect to $\\\\alpha$-embeddings of the probability simplex into the positive\\nmeasure cone. As an application, we report an efficient method to calculate the\\nintersection of a finite set of $\\\\alpha$-divergence spheres.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,cs.LG,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T04:05:12Z\"}"}
