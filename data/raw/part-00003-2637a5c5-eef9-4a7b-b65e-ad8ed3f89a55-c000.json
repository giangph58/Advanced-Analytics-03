Different traffic shaping algorithms have\\nbeen proposed for time-critical communication, of which the Asynchronous\\nTraffic Shaper (ATS) is an upcoming candidate. However, recent research has\\nshown that ATS can introduce unbounded latencies when shaping traffic from\\nnon-FIFO systems. This impacts the applicability of ATS in IVNs, as these\\nnetworks often use redundancy mechanisms that can cause non-FIFO behavior. In\\nthis paper, we approach the problem of accumulated delays from ATS by analyzing\\nthe scenarios that generate latency and by devising placement and\\nconfigurations of ATS schedulers to prevent this behavior. Our solution\\nsuccessfully mitigates problematic preconditions that lead to unbounded delays,\\nwhich we evaluate in simulations. Through a realistic IVN simulation case\\nstudy, we demonstrate the occurrence of unbounded latencies and validate the\\neffectiveness of our approach in avoiding them.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T17:53:37Z\"}"}
