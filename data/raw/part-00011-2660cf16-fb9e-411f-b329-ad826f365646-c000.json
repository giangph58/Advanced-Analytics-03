Inspired by the efficacy of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) in\\nlearning across diverse domains, we explore utilizing multiple experts to learn\\nthe distinct features of various attack types. However, the feature\\ndistributions of physical and digital attacks overlap and differ. This suggests\\nthat relying solely on distinct experts to learn the unique features of each\\nattack type may overlook shared knowledge between them. To address these\\nissues, we propose SUEDE, the Shared Unified Experts for Physical-Digital Face\\nAttack Detection Enhancement. SUEDE combines a shared expert (always activated)\\nto capture common features for both attack types and multiple routed experts\\n(selectively activated) for specific attack types. Further, we integrate CLIP\\nas the base network to ensure the shared expert benefits from prior visual\\nknowledge and align visual-text representations in a unified space. Extensive\\nresults demonstrate SUEDE achieves superior performance compared to\\nstate-of-the-art unified detection methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T08:17:54Z\"}"}
