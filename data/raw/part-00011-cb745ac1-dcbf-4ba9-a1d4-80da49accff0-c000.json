However,\\ndesigning personalized memorial spaces that address the diverse needs of the\\ndying and the bereaved remains underexplored. Using a Research through Design\\n(RtD) approach, we conducted a three-phase study: participatory design, VR\\nmemorial space development, and user testing. This study highlights three key\\naspects: 1) the value of VR memorial spaces as bonding mediums, 2) the role of\\na design process that engages users through co-design, development, and user\\ntesting in addressing the needs of the dying and the bereaved, and 3) design\\nelements that enhance the VR memorial experience. This research lays the\\nfoundation for personalized VR memorialization practices, providing insights\\ninto how technology can enrich remembrance and relational experiences.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T11:17:34Z\"}"}
