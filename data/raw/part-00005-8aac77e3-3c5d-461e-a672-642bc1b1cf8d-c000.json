{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07599v1\", \"title\": \"Tuning chirality amplitude at ultrafast timescales\", \"summary\": \"Chirality is a fundamental symmetry concept describing discrete states, i.e.,\\nleft-handed, right-handed, or achiral, and existing at disparate scales and in\\nmany categories of scientific fields. Even though symmetry breaking is\\nindispensable for describing qualitatively distinct phenomena, symmetry cannot\\nquantitatively predict measurable quantities. One can continuously distort an\\nobject, introducing the concept of chirality amplitude, similar to representing\\nmagnetization as the amplitude of time-reversal symmetry breaking. Considering\\nthe role of magnetization in emergent phenomena with time-reversal symmetry\\nbreaking, chirality amplitude is intuitively a key quantity for controlling\\nchirality-related emergent phenomena. Here, we propose two types of chiral\\nlattice distortions and demonstrate the tunability of their amplitude in\\nultrafast timescales. Resonant X-ray diffraction with circular polarization is\\nan established technique to measure crystal chirality directly. We quantify the\\nultrafast change in chirality amplitude in real time after an optical\\nexcitation. Using instead a THz excitation, we observe oscillations in the\\nresonant diffraction intensities corresponding to specific phonon frequencies.\\nThis indicates the creation of additional asymmetry, which could also be\\ndescribed as an enhancement in chirality amplitude. Our proposed concept of\\nchirality amplitude and its ultrafast control may lead to a unique approach to\\ncontrol chirality-induced emergent phenomena in ultrafast timescales.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T09:52:13Z\"}"}
