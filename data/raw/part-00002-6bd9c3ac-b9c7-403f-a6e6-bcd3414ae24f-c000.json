{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19902v1\", \"title\": \"exoALMA V: Gaseous Emission Surfaces and Temperature Structures\", \"summary\": \"Analysis of the gaseous component in protoplanetary disks can inform us about\\ntheir thermal and physical structure, chemical composition, and kinematic\\nproperties, all of which are crucial for understanding various processes within\\nthe disks. By exploiting the asymmetry of the line emission, or via line\\nprofile analysis, we can locate the emitting surfaces. Here, we present the\\nemission surfaces of the exoALMA sources in $^{12}$CO $J=3-2$, $^{13}$CO\\n$J=3-2$, and CS $J=7-6$. We find that $^{12}$CO traces the upper disk\\natmosphere, with mean <$z/r$> values of $\\\\approx$ 0.28, while $^{13}$CO and CS\\ntrace lower regions of the disk with mean <z/r> values of $\\\\approx$ 0.16 and\\n$\\\\approx$ 0.18, respectively. We find that $^{12}$CO <$z/r$> and the disk mass\\nare positively correlated with each other; this relationship offers a\\nstraightforward way to infer the disk mass. We derive 2-D $r-z$ temperature\\ndistributions of the disks. Additionally, we search for substructure in the\\nsurfaces and radial intensity profiles; we find evidence of localized\\nsubstructure in the emission surfaces and peak intensity profiles of nearly\\nevery disk, with this substructure often being co-incident between molecular\\ntracers, intensity profiles, and kinematic perturbations. Four disks display\\nevidence of potential photo-desorption, implying that this effect may be common\\neven in low FUV star-forming regions. For most disks, we find that the physical\\nand thermal structure is more complex than analytical models can account for,\\nhighlighting a need for more theoretical work and a better understanding of the\\nrole of projection effects on our observations.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:33:15Z\"}"}
