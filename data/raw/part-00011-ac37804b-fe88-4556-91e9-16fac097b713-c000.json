{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16791v1\", \"title\": \"Radiometer Calibration using Machine Learning\", \"summary\": \"Radiometers are crucial instruments in radio astronomy, forming the primary\\ncomponent of nearly all radio telescopes. They measure the intensity of\\nelectromagnetic radiation, converting this radiation into electrical signals. A\\nradiometer's primary components are an antenna and a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA),\\nwhich is the core of the ``receiver'' chain. Instrumental effects introduced by\\nthe receiver are typically corrected or removed during calibration. However,\\nimpedance mismatches between the antenna and receiver can introduce unwanted\\nsignal reflections and distortions. Traditional calibration methods, such as\\nDicke switching, alternate the receiver input between the antenna and a\\nwell-characterised reference source to mitigate errors by comparison. Recent\\nadvances in Machine Learning (ML) offer promising alternatives. Neural\\nnetworks, which are trained using known signal sources, provide a powerful\\nmeans to model and calibrate complex systems where traditional analytical\\napproaches struggle. These methods are especially relevant for detecting the\\nfaint sky-averaged 21-cm signal from atomic hydrogen at high redshifts. This is\\none of the main challenges in observational Cosmology today. Here, for the\\nfirst time, we introduce and test a machine learning-based calibration\\nframework capable of achieving the precision required for radiometric\\nexperiments aiming to detect the 21-cm line.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.CO,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:10:25Z\"}"}
