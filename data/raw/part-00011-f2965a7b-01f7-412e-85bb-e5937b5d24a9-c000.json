While it is arguably the most mature application of quantum\\ncryptography, it has inherent limitations in the achievable distance and the\\nscalability to large-scale infrastructures. While the applicability of QKD can\\nbe readily increased with the use of intermediary trusted nodes, this adds\\nadditional privacy requirements on third parties. In this work, we present an\\nefficient scheme leveraging a trusted node with lower privacy requirements\\nthanks to the use of post-quantum cryptographic techniques, and implement it on\\na deployed fiber optic quantum communication network in the Paris area.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:06:16Z\"}"}
