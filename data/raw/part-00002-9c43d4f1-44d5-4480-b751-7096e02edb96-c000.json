The method is compared with previously\\nproposed Gestalt-based method. Melodies are represented as discrete symbolic\\npitch-time signals. We apply the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) with the\\nHaar wavelet at specific scales, obtaining filtered versions of melodies\\nemphasizing their information at particular time-scales. We use the filtered\\nsignal for representation and segmentation, using the wavelet coefficients'\\nlocal maxima to indicate local boundaries and classify segments by means of\\nk-nearest neighbours based on standard vector-metrics (Euclidean, cityblock),\\nand compare the results to a Gestalt-based segmentation method and metrics\\napplied directly to the pitch signal. We found that the wavelet based\\nsegmentation and wavelet-filtering of the pitch signal lead to better\\nclassification accuracy in cross-validated evaluation when the time-scale and\\nother parameters are optimized.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T08:02:37Z\"}"}
