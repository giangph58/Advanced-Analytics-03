In this\\nwork, we present a systematic calculation of the charged-current semi-inclusive\\ndeep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) in the $eN$ collinear frame up to twist-3\\nlevel at leading order. Semi-inclusive refers to the process in which a jet is\\ndetected in addition to the scattered neutrino. We focus on neutrino-jet\\ncorrelations in our calculation. We first present the differential cross\\nsection in terms of structure functions, followed by the differential cross\\nsection expressed in term of transverse momentum dependent parton distribution\\nfunctions. We derive the complete set of azimuthal asymmetries and intrinsic\\nasymmetries. We also introduce an observable $A^C$, defined as the ratio of the\\ndifference to the sum of differential cross sections for electron and positron\\nsemi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering. We notice that $A^C$ not only\\nprovides a sensitive probe for valence quark distribution functions but also\\ncan reveal the violation of strange-antistrange symmetry.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T03:15:28Z\"}"}
