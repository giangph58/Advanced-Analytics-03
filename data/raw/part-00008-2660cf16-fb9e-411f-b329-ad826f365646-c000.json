{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04815v1\", \"title\": \"Beyond Answers: How LLMs Can Pursue Strategic Thinking in Education\", \"summary\": \"Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds transformative potential in education,\\nenabling personalized learning, enhancing inclusivity, and encouraging\\ncreativity and curiosity. In this paper, we explore how Large Language Models\\n(LLMs) can act as both patient tutors and collaborative partners to enhance\\neducation delivery. As tutors, LLMs personalize learning by offering\\nstep-by-step explanations and addressing individual needs, making education\\nmore inclusive for students with diverse backgrounds or abilities. As\\ncollaborators, they expand students' horizons, supporting them in tackling\\ncomplex, real-world problems and co-creating innovative projects. However, to\\nfully realize these benefits, LLMs must be leveraged not as tools for providing\\ndirect solutions but rather to guide students in developing resolving\\nstrategies and finding learning paths together. Therefore, a strong emphasis\\nshould be placed on educating students and teachers on the successful use of\\nLLMs to ensure their effective integration into classrooms. Through practical\\nexamples and real-world case studies, this paper illustrates how LLMs can make\\neducation more inclusive and engaging while empowering students to reach their\\nfull potential.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY,cs.ET,eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T08:09:46Z\"}"}
