{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06882v1\", \"title\": \"Brillouin Platycosms and Topological Phases\", \"summary\": \"There exist ten distinct closed flat $3$D manifolds, known as platycosms,\\nwhich hold significance in mathematics and have been postulated as potential\\ngeometric models for our universe. In this work, we demonstrate their\\nmanifestation as universes of Bloch particles, namely as momentum-space units\\nreferred to as Brillouin platycosms, which are natural extensions of the\\nBrillouin torus within a broader framework of projective crystallographic\\nsymmetries. Moreover, we provide exact K-theoretical classifications of\\ntopological insulators over these platycosms by the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral\\nsequence, and formulate a complete set of topological invariants for their\\nidentification. Topological phase transitions are generically characterized by\\nWeyl semimetals, adhering to the generalized Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem: the\\ntotal chirality number over a Brillouin platycosm is even (zero) if the\\nplatycosm is non-orientable (orientable). Our work generalizes the notion of\\nBrillouin torus to ten Brillouin platycosms and therefore fundamentally\\ndiversifies the stages on which Block wavefunctions can perform their\\ntopological dance.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:36:41Z\"}"}
