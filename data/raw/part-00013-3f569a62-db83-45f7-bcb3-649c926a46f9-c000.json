Here, we consider discrete Markov networks in which an observer\\nhas access to a few visible transitions and the waiting times between these\\ntransitions. Focusing on the underlying structure of a discrete network, we\\npresent methods to infer local and global properties of the network from\\nobserved data. First, we derive bounds on the microscopic entropy production\\nalong the hidden paths between two visible transitions, which complement extant\\nbounds on mean entropy production and affinities of hidden cycles. Second, we\\ndemonstrate how the operationally accessible data encodes information about the\\ntopology of shortest hidden paths, which can be used to identify potential\\nclusters of states or exclude their existence. Finally, we outline a systematic\\nway to combine the inferred data, resulting in an algorithm that finds the\\ncandidates for a minimal graph of the underlying network, i.e., a graph that is\\npart of the original one and compatible with the observations. Our results\\nhighlight the interplay between thermodynamic methods, waiting-time\\ndistributions and topological aspects like network structure, which can be\\nexpected to provide novel insights in other set-ups of coarse graining as well.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T16:26:29Z\"}"}
