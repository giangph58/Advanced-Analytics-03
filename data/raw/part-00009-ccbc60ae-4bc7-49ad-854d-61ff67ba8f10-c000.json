Being essentially a\\nprogram synthesis algorithm, it is capable of tackling multiple problem\\ndomains. Current benchmarking initiatives are fragmented, as the different\\nrepresentations are not compared with each other and their performance is not\\nmeasured across the different domains. In this work, we propose a unified\\nframework, dubbed TinyverseGP (inspired by tinyGP), which provides support to\\nmultiple representations and problem domains, including symbolic regression,\\nlogic synthesis and policy search.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NE\", \"categories\": \"cs.NE,cs.LG,cs.SC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T14:14:27Z\"}"}
