{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20492v1\", \"title\": \"Triadic Closure-Heterogeneity-Harmony GCN for Link Prediction\", \"summary\": \"Link prediction aims to estimate the likelihood of connections between pairs\\nof nodes in complex networks, which is beneficial to many applications from\\nfriend recommendation to metabolic network reconstruction. Traditional\\nheuristic-based methodologies in the field of complex networks typically depend\\non predefined assumptions about node connectivity, limiting their\\ngeneralizability across diverse networks. While recent graph neural network\\n(GNN) approaches capture global structural features effectively, they often\\nneglect node attributes and intrinsic structural relationships between node\\npairs. To address this, we propose TriHetGCN, an extension of traditional Graph\\nConvolutional Networks (GCNs) that incorporates explicit topological indicators\\n-- triadic closure and degree heterogeneity. TriHetGCN consists of three\\nmodules: topology feature construction, graph structural representation, and\\nconnection probability prediction. The topology feature module constructs node\\nfeatures using shortest path distances to anchor nodes, enhancing global\\nstructure perception. The graph structural module integrates topological\\nindicators into the GCN framework to model triadic closure and heterogeneity.\\nThe connection probability module uses deep learning to predict links.\\nEvaluated on nine real-world datasets, from traditional networks without node\\nattributes to large-scale networks with rich features, TriHetGCN achieves\\nstate-of-the-art performance, outperforming mainstream methods. This highlights\\nits strong generalization across diverse network types, offering a promising\\nframework that bridges statistical physics and graph deep learning.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SI\", \"categories\": \"cs.SI,physics.data-an,physics.soc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T07:32:55Z\"}"}
