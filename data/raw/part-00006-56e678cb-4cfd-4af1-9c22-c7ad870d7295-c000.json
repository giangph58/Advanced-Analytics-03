{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05364v1\", \"title\": \"Machine learning bridging battery field data and laboratory data\", \"summary\": \"Aiming at the dilemma that most laboratory data-driven diagnostic and\\nprognostic methods cannot be applied to field batteries in passenger cars and\\nenergy storage systems, this paper proposes a method to bridge field data and\\nlaboratory data using machine learning. Only two field real impedances\\ncorresponding to a medium frequency and a high frequency are needed to predict\\nlaboratory real impedance curve, laboratory charge/discharge curve, and\\nlaboratory relaxation curve. Based on the predicted laboratory data, laboratory\\ndata-driven methods can be used for field battery diagnosis and prognosis.\\nCompared with the field data-driven methods based on massive historical field\\ndata, the proposed method has the advantages of higher accuracy, lower cost,\\nfaster speed, readily available, and no use of private data. The proposed\\nmethod is tested using two open-source datasets containing 249 NMC cells. For a\\ntest set containing 76 cells, the mean absolute percentage errors of laboratory\\nreal impedance curve, charge curve, and discharge curve prediction results are\\n0.85%, 4.72%, and 2.69%, respectively. This work fills the gap between\\nlaboratory data-driven diagnostic and prognostic methods and field battery\\napplications, making all laboratory data-driven methods applicable to field\\nbattery diagnosis and prognosis. Furthermore, this work overturns the fixed\\npath of developing field battery diagnostic and prognostic methods based on\\nmassive field historical data, opening up new research and breakthrough\\ndirections for field battery diagnosis and prognosis.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:58:57Z\"}"}
