{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03290v1\", \"title\": \"Surpassing the Global Heisenberg Limit Using a High-effciency Quantum\\n  Switch\", \"summary\": \"Indefinite causal orders have been shown to enable a precision of inverse\\nsquare N in quantum parameter estimation, where N is the number of independent\\nprocesses probed in an experiment. This surpasses the widely accepted ultimate\\nquantum precision of the Heisenberg limit, 1/N. While a recent laboratory\\ndemonstration highlighted this phenomenon, its validity relies on postselection\\nfor it only accounted for a subset of the resources used. Achieving a true\\nviolation of the Heisenberg limit-considering photon loss, detection\\nineffciency, and other imperfections-remains an open challenge. Here, we\\npresent an ultrahigh-effciency quantum switch to estimate the geometric phase\\nassociated with a pair of conjugate position and momentum displacements\\nembedded in a superposition of causal orders. Our experimental data demonstrate\\nprecision surpassing the global Heisenberg limit without artificially\\ncorrecting for losses or imperfections. This work paves the way for quantum\\nmetrology advantages under more general and realistic constraints.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:16:39Z\"}"}
