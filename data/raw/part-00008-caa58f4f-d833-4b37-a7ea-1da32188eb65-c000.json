{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02601v1\", \"title\": \"The Homotopy Category of Strongly flat modules\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we plan to build upon significant results by Amnon Neeman\\nregarding the homotopy category of flat modules to study\\n${\\\\mathbb{K}}({S\\\\rm{SF}}\\\\mbox{-}R)$, the homotopy category of $S$-strongly flat\\nmodules, where $S$ is a multiplicatively closed subset of a commutative ring\\n$R$. The category ${\\\\mathbb{K}}({S\\\\rm{SF}}\\\\mbox{-}R)$ is an intermediate\\ntriangulated category that includes ${\\\\mathbb{K}}({\\\\rm{Prj}\\\\mbox{-}} R)$, the\\nhomotopy category of projective $R$-modules, which is always well generated by\\na result of Neeman, and is included in ${\\\\mathbb{K}}({\\\\rm{Flat}}\\\\mbox{-} R)$,\\nthe homotopy category of flat $R$-modules, which is well generated if and only\\nif $R$ is perfect, by a result of \\\\v{S}\\\\'{t}ov\\\\'{i}\\\\v{c}ek. We analyze\\ncorresponding inclusion functors and the existence of their adjoints. In this\\nway, we provide a new, fully faithful embedding of the homotopy category of\\nprojectives to the homotopy category of $S$-strongly flat modules. We introduce\\nthe notion of $S$-almost well generated triangulated categories. If $R$ is an\\n$S$-almost perfect ring, ${\\\\mathbb{K}}({\\\\rm{Flat}}\\\\mbox{-} R)$ is $S$-almost\\nwell generated. We show that the converse is true under certain conditions on\\nthe ring $R$. We hope that this approach provides insights into the largely\\nmysterious class of $S$-strongly flat modules.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AC\", \"categories\": \"math.AC,math.RT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:03:52Z\"}"}
