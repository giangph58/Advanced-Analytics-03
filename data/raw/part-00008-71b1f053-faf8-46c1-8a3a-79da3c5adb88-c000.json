{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03725v1\", \"title\": \"Meta-Optimization and Program Search using Language Models for Task and\\n  Motion Planning\", \"summary\": \"Intelligent interaction with the real world requires robotic agents to\\njointly reason over high-level plans and low-level controls. Task and motion\\nplanning (TAMP) addresses this by combining symbolic planning and continuous\\ntrajectory generation. Recently, foundation model approaches to TAMP have\\npresented impressive results, including fast planning times and the execution\\nof natural language instructions. Yet, the optimal interface between high-level\\nplanning and low-level motion generation remains an open question: prior\\napproaches are limited by either too much abstraction (e.g., chaining\\nsimplified skill primitives) or a lack thereof (e.g., direct joint angle\\nprediction). Our method introduces a novel technique employing a form of\\nmeta-optimization to address these issues by: (i) using program search over\\ntrajectory optimization problems as an interface between a foundation model and\\nrobot control, and (ii) leveraging a zero-order method to optimize numerical\\nparameters in the foundation model output. Results on challenging object\\nmanipulation and drawing tasks confirm that our proposed method improves over\\nprior TAMP approaches.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T17:53:14Z\"}"}
