Recent advancements have positioned diffusion models as\\neffective MDE tools by framing the challenge as a conditional image generation\\ntask. Despite their progress, these methods often struggle with accurately\\nreconstructing distant depths, due largely to the imbalanced distribution of\\ndepth values and an over-reliance on spatial-domain features. To overcome these\\nlimitations, we introduce VistaDepth, a novel framework that integrates\\nadaptive frequency-domain feature enhancements with an adaptive\\nweight-balancing mechanism into the diffusion process. Central to our approach\\nis the Latent Frequency Modulation (LFM) module, which dynamically refines\\nspectral responses in the latent feature space, thereby improving the\\npreservation of structural details and reducing noisy artifacts. Furthermore,\\nwe implement an adaptive weighting strategy that modulates the diffusion loss\\nin real-time, enhancing the model's sensitivity towards distant depth\\nreconstruction. These innovations collectively result in superior depth\\nperception performance across both distance and detail. Experimental\\nevaluations confirm that VistaDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance among\\ndiffusion-based MDE techniques, particularly excelling in the accurate\\nreconstruction of distant regions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T13:30:51Z\"}"}
