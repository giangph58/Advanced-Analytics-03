{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10888v1\", \"title\": \"CDUPatch: Color-Driven Universal Adversarial Patch Attack for Dual-Modal\\n  Visible-Infrared Detectors\", \"summary\": \"Adversarial patches are widely used to evaluate the robustness of object\\ndetection systems in real-world scenarios. These patches were initially\\ndesigned to deceive single-modal detectors (e.g., visible or infrared) and have\\nrecently been extended to target visible-infrared dual-modal detectors.\\nHowever, existing dual-modal adversarial patch attacks have limited attack\\neffectiveness across diverse physical scenarios. To address this, we propose\\nCDUPatch, a universal cross-modal patch attack against visible-infrared object\\ndetectors across scales, views, and scenarios. Specifically, we observe that\\ncolor variations lead to different levels of thermal absorption, resulting in\\ntemperature differences in infrared imaging. Leveraging this property, we\\npropose an RGB-to-infrared adapter that maps RGB patches to infrared patches,\\nenabling unified optimization of cross-modal patches. By learning an optimal\\ncolor distribution on the adversarial patch, we can manipulate its thermal\\nresponse and generate an adversarial infrared texture. Additionally, we\\nintroduce a multi-scale clipping strategy and construct a new visible-infrared\\ndataset, MSDrone, which contains aerial vehicle images in varying scales and\\nperspectives. These data augmentation strategies enhance the robustness of our\\npatch in real-world conditions. Experiments on four benchmark datasets (e.g.,\\nDroneVehicle, LLVIP, VisDrone, MSDrone) show that our method outperforms\\nexisting patch attacks in the digital domain. Extensive physical tests further\\nconfirm strong transferability across scales, views, and scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T05:46:00Z\"}"}
