The 3$\\\\omega$ technique is an established methodology for\\nstudying the thermal conductivity of thin films and becomes particularly\\nsuitable in the case of bulk specimens at room temperature and above, where\\nstandard stationary techniques require significant corrections for radiative\\nlosses. Although this method has been employed in several works, it remains not\\nwidely adopted because its implementation demands considerable sophistication,\\nincluding experiment design, thin film deposition techniques and choices of the\\ngeometry of the current/heat transducer, electronics, and analytical treatment\\nof the signals. This work reviews the technique's most crucial technical\\naspects, providing practical support for a quick and user-friendly\\nimplementation, from the design phase to the execution and analysis. We release\\na Python-based graphical user interface that supports a quick quantitative\\nestimation of the investigated temperature profiles based on the geometrical\\nparameters (width/length) of the deposited transducer (heater/thermometer metal\\nline) before an experiment, guaranteeing an optimal engineering of the\\nexperimental conditions for each given material under scrutiny.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.ins-det\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:24:55Z\"}"}
