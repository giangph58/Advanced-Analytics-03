{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20610v1\", \"title\": \"Information Retrieval in the Age of Generative AI: The RGB Model\", \"summary\": \"The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI is fundamentally\\ntransforming information retrieval and processing on the Internet, bringing\\nboth great potential and significant concerns regarding content authenticity\\nand reliability. This paper presents a novel quantitative approach to shed\\nlight on the complex information dynamics arising from the growing use of\\ngenerative AI tools. Despite their significant impact on the digital ecosystem,\\nthese dynamics remain largely uncharted and poorly understood. We propose a\\nstochastic model to characterize the generation, indexing, and dissemination of\\ninformation in response to new topics. This scenario particularly challenges\\ncurrent LLMs, which often rely on real-time Retrieval-Augmented Generation\\n(RAG) techniques to overcome their static knowledge limitations. Our findings\\nsuggest that the rapid pace of generative AI adoption, combined with increasing\\nuser reliance, can outpace human verification, escalating the risk of\\ninaccurate information proliferation across digital resources. An in-depth\\nanalysis of Stack Exchange data confirms that high-quality answers inevitably\\nrequire substantial time and human effort to emerge. This underscores the\\nconsiderable risks associated with generating persuasive text in response to\\nnew questions and highlights the critical need for responsible development and\\ndeployment of future generative AI tools.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR,cs.AI,cs.PF\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T10:21:40Z\"}"}
