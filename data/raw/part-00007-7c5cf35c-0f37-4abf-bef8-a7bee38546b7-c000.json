{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15931v1\", \"title\": \"Benchmarking the Reproducibility of Brain MRI Segmentation Across\\n  Scanners and Time\", \"summary\": \"Accurate and reproducible brain morphometry from structural MRI is critical\\nfor monitoring neuroanatomical changes across time and across imaging domains.\\nAlthough deep learning has accelerated segmentation workflows, scanner-induced\\nvariability and reproducibility limitations remain-especially in longitudinal\\nand multi-site settings. In this study, we benchmark two modern segmentation\\npipelines, FastSurfer and SynthSeg, both integrated into FreeSurfer, one of the\\nmost widely adopted tools in neuroimaging.\\n  Using two complementary datasets - a 17-year longitudinal cohort (SIMON) and\\na 9-site test-retest cohort (SRPBS)-we quantify inter-scan segmentation\\nvariability using Dice coefficient, Surface Dice, Hausdorff Distance (HD95),\\nand Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Our results reveal up to 7-8% volume\\nvariation in small subcortical structures such as the amygdala and ventral\\ndiencephalon, even under controlled test-retest conditions. This raises a key\\nquestion: is it feasible to detect subtle longitudinal changes on the order of\\n5-10% in pea-sized brain regions, given the magnitude of domain-induced\\nmorphometric noise?\\n  We further analyze the effects of registration templates and interpolation\\nmodes, and propose surface-based quality filtering to improve segmentation\\nreliability. This study provides a reproducible benchmark for morphometric\\nreproducibility and emphasizes the need for harmonization strategies in\\nreal-world neuroimaging studies.\\n  Code and figures: https://github.com/kondratevakate/brain-mri-segmentation\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T14:20:18Z\"}"}
