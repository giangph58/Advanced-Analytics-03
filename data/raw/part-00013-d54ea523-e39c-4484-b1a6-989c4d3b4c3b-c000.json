The generalized free theories refer to the $\\\\Box^k$ free scalar\\ntheories with a higher-derivative kinetic term, which is related to the\\nmulticritical generalizations of the Lifshitz type. We assume that the\\n(generalized) free theories and the deformed theories have boundary conformal\\nsymmetry and O($N$) global symmetry. The leading anomalous dimensions of some\\nboundary operators are derived from the bulk multiplet recombination and\\nanalyticity constraints. We find that the $\\\\epsilon^{1/2}$ expansion in the\\n$\\\\phi^6$-tricritical version of the special transition extends to other\\nmulticritical cases with larger odd integer $n$, and most of the higher\\nderivative cases involve a noninteger power expansion in $\\\\epsilon$. Using the\\nanalytic bootstrap, we further verify that the multiplet-recombination results\\nare consistent with boundary crossing symmetry.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T16:08:28Z\"}"}
