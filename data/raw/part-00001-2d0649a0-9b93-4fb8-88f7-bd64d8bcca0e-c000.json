The new data reveal that the\\ncharge radii of scandium isotopes exhibit a distinct trend between $N=20$ and\\n$N=28$, with $^{41}$Sc and $^{49}$Sc isotopes having similar values, mirroring\\nthe closeness of the charge radii of $^{40}$Ca and $^{48}$Ca. Theoretical\\nmodels that successfully interpret the radii of calcium isotopes could not\\naccount for the observed behavior in scandium radii, in particular the reduced\\nodd-even staggering. Remarkably, the inclusion of the new $^{49}$Sc radius data\\nhas unveiled a similar trend in the charge radii of $N=28$ isotones and $Z=20$\\nisotopes when adding the neutrons atop the $^{40}$Ca core and the protons atop\\nthe $^{48}$Ca core, respectively. We demonstrate that this trend is consistent\\nwith the prediction of the seniority model.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-ex\", \"categories\": \"nucl-ex,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T11:53:55Z\"}"}
