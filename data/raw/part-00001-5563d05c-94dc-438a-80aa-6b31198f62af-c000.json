The Yau-Yau method is a highly versatile framework that\\ntransforms nonlinear filtering problems into initial-value problems governed by\\nthe Forward Kolmogorov Equation (FKE). Previous researches have shown that the\\nmethod can be applied to highly nonlinear and high dimensional problems.\\nHowever, when time-varying coefficients are involved in the system models,\\ndeveloping an implementation of the method with high computational speed and\\nlow data storage still presents a challenge. To address these limitations, this\\npaper proposes a novel numerical algorithm that incorporates physics-informed\\nneural network (PINN) and principal component analysis (PCA) to solve the FKE\\napproximately. Equipped with this algorithm, the Yau-Yau filter can be\\nimplemented by an offline stage for the training of a solver for the\\napproximate solution of FKE and an online stage for its execution. Results of\\nthree examples indicate that this implementation is accurate, both\\ntime-efficient and storage-efficient for online computation, and is superior\\nthan existing nonlinear filtering methods such as extended Kalman filter and\\nparticle filter. It is capable of applications to practical nonlinear\\ntime-variant filtering problems.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T07:11:45Z\"}"}
