The strange correlator exhibits long-range order\\nwhen evaluated between two distinct NISPTs and decays exponentially otherwise.\\nWe show that strange charged operators inserted into the strange correlator are\\nlinked to the interface algebra (boundary tube algebra) and are non-trivial\\nwhen all its irreducible representations have dimensions greater than one. We\\ndiscuss the generalization to higher dimensions. The string order parameter is\\nobtained by contracting the truncated symmetry operator with charge decoration\\noperators, which are determined by the NISPT action tensors. We illustrate the\\nabove construction using the three NISPTs of $\\\\text{Rep}(D_8)$ and demonstrate\\nthe extraction of categorical data via tensor networks, particularly through\\nthe ZX calculus. Finally, we show that the entanglement spectrum degeneracy is\\ndetermined by the irreducible representations of the interface algebra when\\nassuming non-invertible symmetry on-site condition.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,hep-th,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T17:26:43Z\"}"}
