In this work, we revisit\\nthe anisotropic component of cosmic birefringence, which leads to the\\ngeneration of $B$-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB).\\nUsing an exact theoretical treatment beyond the thin last-scattering surface\\napproximation, we constrain the amplitude of anisotropic birefringence with\\ncombined polarization data from SPTpol, ACT, POLARBEAR, and BICEP. The joint\\nanalysis yields a best-fit amplitude of $A_{\\\\rm CB} = 0.42^{+0.40}_{-0.34}\\n\\\\times 10^{-4}$, consistent with zero within $2\\\\sigma$, and we place a 95\\\\%\\nconfidence-level upper bound of $A_{\\\\rm CB} < 1 \\\\times 10^{-4}$. The constraint\\nis not dominated by any single experiment and remains robust under the\\ninclusion of a possible isotropic rotation angle. These results provide leading\\nconstraints on anisotropic cosmic birefringence from CMB $B$-mode polarization\\nand illustrate the potential of upcoming experiments to improve sensitivity to\\nparity-violating effects in the early universe.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:56:23Z\"}"}
