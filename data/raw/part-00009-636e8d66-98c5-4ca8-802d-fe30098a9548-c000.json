{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13138v1\", \"title\": \"Extending the Mott-Gurney law to one-dimensional nonplanar diodes using\\n  point transformations\", \"summary\": \"Recent studies have applied variational calculus, conformal mapping, and\\npoint transformations to generalize the one-dimensional (1D) space-charge\\nlimited current density (SCLCD) and electron emission mechanisms to nonplanar\\ngeometries; however, these assessments have focused on extending the\\nChild-Langmuir law (CLL) for SCLCD in vacuum. Since the charge in the diode is\\nindependent of coordinate system (i.e., covariant), we apply bijective point\\ntransformations to extend the Mott-Gurney law (MGL) for the SCLCD in a\\ncollisional or semiconductor gap to nonplanar 1D geometries. This yields a\\nmodified MGL that replaces the Cartesian gap distance with a canonical gap\\ndistance that may be written generally in terms of geometric scale factors that\\nare known for multiple geometries. We tabulate results for common geometries.\\nSuch an approach may be applied to any current density, including\\nnon-space-charge limited gaps and SCLCD that may fall between the CLL and MGL.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.app-ph,physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:49:06Z\"}"}
