{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05160v1\", \"title\": \"Temperature-Resilient LC-RIS Phase-Shift Design for Multi-user Downlink\\n  Communications\", \"summary\": \"The reflecting antenna elements in most reconfigurable intelligent surfaces\\n(RISs) use semiconductor-based (e.g., positive-intrinsic-negative (PIN) diodes\\nand varactors) phase shifters. Although effective, a drawback of this\\ntechnology is the high power consumption and cost, which become particularly\\nprohibitive in millimeter-wave (mmWave)/sub-Terahertz range. With the advances\\nin Liquid Crystals (LCs) in microwave engineering, we have observed a new trend\\nin using LC for realizing phase shifter networks of RISs. LC-RISs are expected\\nto significantly reduce the fabrication costs and power consumption. However,\\nthe nematic LC molecules are sensitive to temperature variations. Therefore,\\nimplementing LC-RIS in geographical regions with varying temperatures requires\\ntemperature-resilient designs. The mentioned temperature variation issue\\nbecomes more significant at higher temperatures as the phase shifter range\\nreduces in warmer conditions, whereas it expands in cooler ones. In this paper,\\nwe study the impact of temperature on the operation of LC-RISs and develop a\\ntemperature-resilient phase shift design. Specifically, we formulate a max-min\\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio optimization for a multi-user downlink\\nmmWave network that accounts for the impact of temperature in the LC-RIS phase\\nshifts. The simulation results demonstrate a significant improvement for the\\nconsidered set of parameters when using our algorithm compared to the baseline\\napproach, which neglects the temperature effects.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T11:55:28Z\"}"}
