{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05332v1\", \"title\": \"Signature Decomposition Method Applying to Pair Trading\", \"summary\": \"Quantitative trading strategies based on medium- and high-frequency data have\\nlong been of significant interest in the futures market. The advancement of\\nstatistical arbitrage and deep learning techniques has improved the ability of\\nprocessing high-frequency data, but also reduced arbitrage opportunities for\\ntraditional methods, yielding strategies that are less interpretable and more\\nunstable. Consequently, the pursuit of more stable and interpretable\\nquantitative investment strategies remains a key objective for futures market\\nparticipants. In this study, we propose a novel pairs trading strategy by\\nleveraging the mathematical concept of path signature which serves as a feature\\nrepresentation of time series data. Specifically, the path signature is\\ndecomposed to create two new indicators: the path interactivity indicator\\nsegmented signature and the change direction indicator path difference product.\\nThese indicators serve as double filters in our strategy design. Using\\nminute-level futures data, we demonstrate that our strategy significantly\\nimproves upon traditional pairs trading with increasing returns, reducing\\nmaximum drawdown, and enhancing the Sharpe ratio. The method we have proposed\\nin the present work offers greater interpretability and robustness while\\nensuring a considerable rate of return, highlighting the potential of path\\nsignature techniques in financial trading applications.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:23:04Z\"}"}
