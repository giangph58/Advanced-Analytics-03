{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17703v1\", \"title\": \"Federated Learning: A Survey on Privacy-Preserving Collaborative\\n  Intelligence\", \"summary\": \"Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative paradigm in the field\\nof distributed machine learning, enabling multiple clients such as mobile\\ndevices, edge nodes, or organizations to collaboratively train a shared global\\nmodel without the need to centralize sensitive data. This decentralized\\napproach addresses growing concerns around data privacy, security, and\\nregulatory compliance, making it particularly attractive in domains such as\\nhealthcare, finance, and smart IoT systems. This survey provides a concise yet\\ncomprehensive overview of Federated Learning, beginning with its core\\narchitecture and communication protocol. We discuss the standard FL lifecycle,\\nincluding local training, model aggregation, and global updates. A particular\\nemphasis is placed on key technical challenges such as handling non-IID\\n(non-independent and identically distributed) data, mitigating system and\\nhardware heterogeneity, reducing communication overhead, and ensuring privacy\\nthrough mechanisms like differential privacy and secure aggregation.\\nFurthermore, we examine emerging trends in FL research, including personalized\\nFL, cross-device versus cross-silo settings, and integration with other\\nparadigms such as reinforcement learning and quantum computing. We also\\nhighlight real-world applications and summarize benchmark datasets and\\nevaluation metrics commonly used in FL research. Finally, we outline open\\nresearch problems and future directions to guide the development of scalable,\\nefficient, and trustworthy FL systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T16:10:29Z\"}"}
