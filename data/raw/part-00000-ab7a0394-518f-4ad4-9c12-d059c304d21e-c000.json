{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16557v1\", \"title\": \"Beyond Anonymization: Object Scrubbing for Privacy-Preserving 2D and 3D\\n  Vision Tasks\", \"summary\": \"We introduce ROAR (Robust Object Removal and Re-annotation), a scalable\\nframework for privacy-preserving dataset obfuscation that eliminates sensitive\\nobjects instead of modifying them. Our method integrates instance segmentation\\nwith generative inpainting to remove identifiable entities while preserving\\nscene integrity. Extensive evaluations on 2D COCO-based object detection show\\nthat ROAR achieves 87.5% of the baseline detection average precision (AP),\\nwhereas image dropping achieves only 74.2% of the baseline AP, highlighting the\\nadvantage of scrubbing in preserving dataset utility. The degradation is even\\nmore severe for small objects due to occlusion and loss of fine-grained\\ndetails. Furthermore, in NeRF-based 3D reconstruction, our method incurs a PSNR\\nloss of at most 1.66 dB while maintaining SSIM and improving LPIPS,\\ndemonstrating superior perceptual quality. Our findings establish object\\nremoval as an effective privacy framework, achieving strong privacy guarantees\\nwith minimal performance trade-offs. The results highlight key challenges in\\ngenerative inpainting, occlusion-robust segmentation, and task-specific\\nscrubbing, setting the foundation for future advancements in privacy-preserving\\nvision systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T09:33:10Z\"}"}
