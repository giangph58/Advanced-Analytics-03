{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15577v1\", \"title\": \"State-Aware IoT Scheduling Using Deep Q-Networks and Edge-Based\\n  Coordination\", \"summary\": \"This paper addresses the challenge of energy efficiency management faced by\\nintelligent IoT devices in complex application environments. A novel\\noptimization method is proposed, combining Deep Q-Network (DQN) with an edge\\ncollaboration mechanism. The method builds a state-action-reward interaction\\nmodel and introduces edge nodes as intermediaries for state aggregation and\\npolicy scheduling. This enables dynamic resource coordination and task\\nallocation among multiple devices. During the modeling process, device status,\\ntask load, and network resources are jointly incorporated into the state space.\\nThe DQN is used to approximate and learn the optimal scheduling strategy. To\\nenhance the model's ability to perceive inter-device relationships, a\\ncollaborative graph structure is introduced to model the multi-device\\nenvironment and assist in decision optimization. Experiments are conducted\\nusing real-world IoT data collected from the FastBee platform. Several\\ncomparative and validation tests are performed, including energy efficiency\\ncomparisons across different scheduling strategies, robustness analysis under\\nvarying task loads, and evaluation of state dimension impacts on policy\\nconvergence speed. The results show that the proposed method outperforms\\nexisting baseline approaches in terms of average energy consumption, processing\\nlatency, and resource utilization. This confirms its effectiveness and\\npracticality in intelligent IoT scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T04:24:16Z\"}"}
