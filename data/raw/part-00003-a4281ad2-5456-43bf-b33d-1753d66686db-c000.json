{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09953v1\", \"title\": \"Efficient 2D to Full 3D Human Pose Uplifting including Joint Rotations\", \"summary\": \"In sports analytics, accurately capturing both the 3D locations and rotations\\nof body joints is essential for understanding an athlete's biomechanics. While\\nHuman Mesh Recovery (HMR) models can estimate joint rotations, they often\\nexhibit lower accuracy in joint localization compared to 3D Human Pose\\nEstimation (HPE) models. Recent work addressed this limitation by combining a\\n3D HPE model with inverse kinematics (IK) to estimate both joint locations and\\nrotations. However, IK is computationally expensive. To overcome this, we\\npropose a novel 2D-to-3D uplifting model that directly estimates 3D human\\nposes, including joint rotations, in a single forward pass. We investigate\\nmultiple rotation representations, loss functions, and training strategies -\\nboth with and without access to ground truth rotations. Our models achieve\\nstate-of-the-art accuracy in rotation estimation, are 150 times faster than the\\nIK-based approach, and surpass HMR models in joint localization precision.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T07:32:28Z\"}"}
