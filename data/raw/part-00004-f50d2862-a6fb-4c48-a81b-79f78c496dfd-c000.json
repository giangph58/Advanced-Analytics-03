The density\\nfor a language is defined as the limit in average (if it exists) of the\\nprobability that a word of a given length belongs to the language. We establish\\nthe existence of densities for all rational languages under all shift invariant\\nmeasures. We also give explicit formulas under certain conditions, in\\nparticular when the language is aperiodic. Our approach combines tools and\\nideas from semigroup theory and ergodic theory.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.FL\", \"categories\": \"cs.FL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T13:39:02Z\"}"}
