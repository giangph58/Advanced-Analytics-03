In other words, $K_q(n,r)$ is the minimum\\nsize of a set of $q$-ary codewords of length $n$ such that the Hamming balls of\\nradius $r$ around the codewords cover the Hamming space $\\\\{0,\\\\ldots,q-1\\\\}^n$.\\nThe special case $K_3(n,1)$ is often referred to as the football pool problem,\\nas it is equivalent to finding a set of forecasts on $n$ football matches that\\nis guaranteed to contain a forecast with at most one wrong outcome.\\n  In this paper, we build and expand upon the work of Gijswijt (2005), who\\nintroduced a semidefinite programming lower bound on $K_q(n,r)$ via matrix\\ncuts. We develop techniques that strengthen this bound, by introducing new\\nsemidefinite constraints inspired by Lasserre's hierarchy for 0-1 programs and\\nsymmetry reduction methods, and a more powerful objective function. The\\ntechniques lead to sharper lower bounds, setting new records across a broad\\nrange of values of $q$, $n$, and $r$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,cs.IT,math.IT,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T17:42:03Z\"}"}
