{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00405v1\", \"title\": \"Selling Information in Games with Externalities\", \"summary\": \"A competitive market is modeled as a game of incomplete information. One\\nplayer observes some payoff-relevant state and can sell (possibly noisy)\\nmessages thereof to the other, whose willingness to pay is contingent on their\\nown beliefs. We frame the decision of what information to sell, and at what\\nprice, as a product versioning problem. The optimal menu screens buyer types to\\nmaximize profit, which is the payment minus the externality induced by selling\\ninformation to a competitor, that is, the cost of refining a competitor's\\nbeliefs. For a class of games with binary actions and states, we derive the\\nfollowing insights: (i) payments are necessary to provide incentives for\\ninformation sharing amongst competing firms; (ii) the optimal menu benefits\\nboth the buyer and the seller; (iii) the seller cannot steer the buyer's\\nactions at the expense of social welfare; (iv) as such, as competition grows\\nfiercer it can be optimal to sell no information at all.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GT\", \"categories\": \"cs.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T08:53:16Z\"}"}
