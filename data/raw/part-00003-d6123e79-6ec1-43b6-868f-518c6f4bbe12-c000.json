{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15892v1\", \"title\": \"The accretion disk and neutrino pair annihilation process of\\n  Barrow-modified Black Hole\", \"summary\": \"This paper attempts to clarify the deep consequences of Barrow fractal black\\nhole spacetime configurations caused by quantum gravity on neutrino pair\\nannihilation and accretion disk dynamics. We systematically derive the\\nanalytical expression for the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) radius\\n($r_{\\\\text{ISCO}}\\\\propto M^{2/(2+\\\\Delta)}$) by building a Barrow-modified\\nstatic spherically symmetric metric ($r\\\\rightarrow r^{1+\\\\Delta/2}$), and we\\nfind that increasing $\\\\Delta$ significantly shifts the ISCO inward. We\\nnumerically solve the radiation flux, effective temperature, and differential\\nluminosity distribution under the modified metric based on the Novikov-Thorne\\nrelativistic thin accretion disk model. For $\\\\Delta=1$, the results show that\\nthe temperature increases by $62.5\\\\%$, the peak disk radiation flux increases\\nby $22.5\\\\%$, and the spectral radiance increases by around $50\\\\%$. Fractal\\nhorizons enhance neutrino trajectory bending effects, according to further\\nstudy of neutrino pair annihilation ($\\\\nu\\\\bar{\\\\nu}\\\\rightarrow e^+e^-$) energy\\ndeposition processes using local Lorentz transformations and null geodesic\\nequations. The energy deposition rate for $\\\\Delta=1$ is $8-28$ times higher\\nthan classical estimates when the black hole radius is $R/M\\\\sim3-4$. This work\\nprovides important theoretical insights into the influence of quantum spacetime\\ngeometry on high-energy astrophysical phenomena in extreme gravitational fields\\nby establishing, for the first time, quantitative relationships between the\\nBarrow parameter $\\\\Delta$ and neutrino pair annihilation energy and accretion\\ndisk radiative efficiency.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T13:34:54Z\"}"}
