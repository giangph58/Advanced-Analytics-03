We\\npresent the development and application of convolutional neural networks with\\nmodified autoencoder architecture for the reconstruction of the pulse arrival\\ntime and amplitude in individual scintillating crystals in electromagnetic\\ncalorimeters and other detectors. The network performance is discussed as well\\nas the application of xAI methods for further investigation of the algorithm\\nand improvement of the output accuracy.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det,hep-ex,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T06:01:11Z\"}"}
