{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20494v1\", \"title\": \"An energy-stable minimal deformation rate scheme for mean curvature flow\\n  and surface diffusion\", \"summary\": \"We propose a new parametric finite element method, referred to as the BGN-MDR\\nmethod, for simulating both mean curvature flow and surface diffusion for\\nclosed hypersurfaces, as well as open hypersurfaces with moving contact lines\\nin three dimensions. The method is also applicable to closed and open curves\\nwith moving contact points in two dimensions. The proposed scheme inherits the\\nenergy stability from the BGN scheme proposed by Barrett, Garcke, and\\nN\\\\\\\"urnberg in 2008, and offers improved mesh quality similar to the minimal\\ndeformation rate (MDR) method proposed by Hu and Li in 2022, especially for\\nsmall time step sizes where the BGN scheme may become unstable and result in\\ndeteriorated meshes.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T07:35:49Z\"}"}
