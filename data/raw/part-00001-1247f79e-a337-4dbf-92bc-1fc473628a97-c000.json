{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19778v1\", \"title\": \"Test-Negative Designs with Multiple Testing Sources\", \"summary\": \"Test-negative designs (TNDs), a form of case-cohort study, are widely used to\\nevaluate infectious disease interventions, notably for influenza and, more\\nrecently, COVID-19 vaccines. TNDs rely on recruiting individuals who are tested\\nfor the disease of interest and comparing test-positive and test-negative\\nindividuals by exposure status (e.g., vaccination). Traditionally, TND studies\\nfocused on symptomatic individuals to minimize confounding from\\nhealthcare-seeking behavior. However, during outbreaks such as COVID-19 and\\nEbola, testing also occurred for asymptomatic individuals (e.g., through\\ncontact tracing), introducing potential bias when combining symptomatic and\\nasymptomatic cases. Motivated by a trial evaluating an Ebola virus disease\\n(EVD) vaccine, we study a specific version of this ``multiple reasons for\\ntesting\\\" problem. In this setting, symptomatic individuals were tested under\\nthe standard TND approach, while asymptomatic close contacts of test-positive\\ncases were also tested. We propose a simple method to estimate the common\\nvaccine efficacy across these groups and assess whether efficacy differs by\\nrecruitment pathway. Although the EVD trial ended early due to the cessation of\\nthe outbreak, the proposed methodology remains relevant for future vaccine\\ntrials with similar designs.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T13:24:52Z\"}"}
