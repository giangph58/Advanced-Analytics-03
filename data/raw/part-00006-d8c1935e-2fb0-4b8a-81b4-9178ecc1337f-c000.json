{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16876v1\", \"title\": \"New Primal-Dual Algorithm for Convex Problems\", \"summary\": \"Primal-dual algorithm (PDA) is a classic and popular scheme for\\nconvex-concave saddle point problems. It is universally acknowledged that the\\nproximal terms in the subproblems about the primal and dual variables are\\ncrucial to the convergence theory and numerical performance of primal-dual\\nalgorithms. By taking advantage of the information from the current and\\nprevious iterative points, we exploit two new proximal terms for the\\nsubproblems about the primal and dual variables. Based on two new proximal\\nterms, we present a new primal-dual algorithm for convex-concave saddle point\\nproblems with bilinear coupling terms and establish its global convergence and\\nO(1/N ) ergodic convergence rate. When either the primal function or the dual\\nfunction is strongly convex, we accelerate the above proposed algorithm and\\nshow that the corresponding algorithm can achieve O(1/N^2) convergence rate.\\nSince the conditions for the stepsizes of the proposed algorithm are related\\ndirectly to the spectral norm of the linear transform, which is difficult to\\nobtain in some applications, we also introduce a linesearch strategy for the\\nabove proposed primal-dual algorithm and establish its global convergence and\\nO(1/N ) ergodic convergence rate . Some numerical experiments are conducted on\\nmatrix game and LASSO problems by comparing with other state-of-the-art\\nalgorithms, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed three\\nprimal-dual algorithms.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T16:53:14Z\"}"}
