{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20542v1\", \"title\": \"Digital Twin-Empowered Cooperative Autonomous Car-sharing Services:\\n  Proof-of-Concept\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents a digital twin-empowered real-time optimal delivery\\nsystem specifically validated through a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstration of\\na real-world autonomous car-sharing service. This study integrates real-time\\ndata from roadside units (RSUs) and connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs)\\nwithin a digital twin of a campus environment to address the dynamic challenges\\nof urban traffic. The proposed system leverages the Age of Information (AoI)\\nmetric to optimize vehicle routing by maintaining data freshness and\\ndynamically adapting to real-time traffic conditions. Experimental results from\\nthe PoC demonstrate a 22% improvement in delivery efficiency compared to\\nconventional shortest-path methods that do not consider information freshness.\\nFurthermore, digital twin-based simulation results demonstrate that this\\nproposed system improves overall delivery efficiency by 12% and effectively\\nreduces the peak average AoI by 23% compared to the conventional method, where\\neach vehicle selects the shortest route without considering information\\nfreshness. This study confirms the practical feasibility of cooperative driving\\nsystems, highlighting their potential to enhance smart mobility solutions\\nthrough scalable digital twin deployments in complex urban environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.OH\", \"categories\": \"cs.OH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T08:38:30Z\"}"}
