The resulting bio-graphite was used to\\nproduce reduced graphene oxide (rGO) via a modified Hummers method. The\\nbio-graphite derived rGO was further incorporated with orthorhombic structured\\nMoO$_3$ at different percentages (1, 3, and 6 wt.%) using ultrasonication.\\nStructural, morphological, and functional characterizations were conducted\\nusing XRD, FESEM, FTIR, and UV-Vis DRS spectroscopy, revealing a bandgap of\\n2.82 eV for the rGO(3 wt.%)-MoO$_3$ composite. Photocatalytic activity was\\nevaluated via methylene blue degradation under natural sunlight. The rGO(3\\nwt.%)-MoO$_3$ nanocomposite showed superior performance, achieving 90%\\ndegradation in 150 minutes when compared to 65% by pure MoO$_3$. The Scavenger\\ntests confirmed superoxide radicals $(\\\\cdot O_2^-)$ as the main reactive\\nspecies. This work highlights the potential of bio-graphite derived rGO-MoO$_3$\\nnanocomposites as efficient, eco-friendly photocatalysts for wastewater\\ntreatment.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T12:56:12Z\"}"}
