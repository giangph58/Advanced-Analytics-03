Due to the asymptotic freedom at the short distances,\\nafter proper factorization, one can predict the value of high-energy physical\\nobservable by using the perturbative QCD (pQCD). It has been demonstrated that\\nby recursively using of renormalization group equation with the help of\\nPrinciple of Maximum Conformality (PMC), one can eliminate conventional\\nrenormalization scheme-and-scale ambiguities existed in the initial fixed-order\\npQCD series. To extend the predictive power of pQCD, we are still facing the\\nproblem of how to reliably estimate the contributions from the unknown\\nhigher-order (UHO) terms. In this paper, using the PMC scheme-and-scale\\ninvariant series as the starting point, we suggest a novel method of using\\nlinear regression through the origin (LRTO) to fix the asymptotic form of the\\npQCD series, which subsequently predicts the reasonable magnitude of the\\none-order higher UHO-terms. As an explicit example, we apply the method to deal\\nwith the ratio $R_\\\\tau$, which has been calculated up to four-loop QCD\\ncorrections. Our results show that the LRTO method works well, demonstrating\\nits reliability and significant predictive power for estimating the UHO-terms.\\nEspecially, we show that the scale-invariant and more convergent PMC series\\nexhibits a much better predictive power with stability and reliability than the\\ninitial scale-dependent pQCD series.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T11:09:40Z\"}"}
