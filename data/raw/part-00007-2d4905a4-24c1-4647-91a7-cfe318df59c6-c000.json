It is shown that\\nthese systems admit local strong as well as global strong solutions for small\\ndata in the setting of critical Besov spaces. Moreover, non-trivial equilibria\\nare shown to be exponentially stable. For smoother data, these solutions are\\nshown to be globally bounded and to preserve positivity properties. The\\napproach presented is based on optimal $\\\\mathrm{L}^q$-regularity properties of\\nthe Neumann Laplacian and the Stokes operator in bounded Lipschitz domains.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T15:23:03Z\"}"}
