While previous studies have explored individual\\ndimensions, such as size, the combined effect of multiple geometric properties\\non perceptual illusions remains poorly understood. We present a two-alternative\\nforced choice study investigating the perceptual interplay between object size\\nand taper angle. We introduce an illusion space model, providing detailed\\ninsights into how physical and virtual object configurations affect human\\nperception. Our insights reveal how, for example, as virtual sizes increase,\\nusers perceive that taper angles increase, and as virtual angles decrease,\\nusers overestimate sizes. We provide a mathematical model of the illusion\\nspace, and an associated tool, which can be used as a guide for the design of\\nfuture VR haptic devices and for proxy object selections.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T08:19:56Z\"}"}
