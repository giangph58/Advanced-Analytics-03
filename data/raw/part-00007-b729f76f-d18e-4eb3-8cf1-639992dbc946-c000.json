{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03478v1\", \"title\": \"Allowed and unique first-forbidden stellar electron emission rates of\\n  neutron-rich copper isotopes\", \"summary\": \"The allowed charge-changing transitions are the most common weak interaction\\nprocesses of spin-isospin form that play a crucial role in several\\nnuclear/astrophysical processes. The first-forbidden (FF) transition becomes\\nimportant, in the circumstances where allowed Gamow-Teller (GT) transitions are\\nunfavored, specifically for neutron-rich nuclei due to phase space\\nconsiderations. In this paper deformed proton-neutron quasi-particle random\\nphase approximation (pn-QRPA) model is applied, for the first time, for the\\nestimation of allowed GT and unique first-forbidden (U1F) transitions\\n($|\\\\Delta$J$|$ = 2) of neutron rich copper isotopes in mass range 72 $\\\\leq$ A\\n$\\\\leq$ 82 under stellar conditions. We compared our computed terrestrial\\n$\\\\beta$-decay half-life values with previous calculations and experimental\\nresults. It was concluded that the pn-QRPA calculation is in good accordance\\nwith measured data. Our study suggests that the addition of rank (0 and 1)\\noperators in FF transitions can further improve the comparison which remain\\nunattended at this stage. The deformed pn-QRPA model was employed for the\\nestimation of GT and U1F stellar electron emission ($\\\\beta$$^{-}$-decay) rates\\nover wide range of stellar temperature (0.01 GK -- 30 GK) and density (10 --\\n10$^{11}$ g/cm$^{3}$) domains for astrophysical applications. Our study shows\\nthat, in high density and low temperature regions, the contribution of U1F\\nrates to total electron emission rates of neutron-rich copper nuclei is\\nnegligible.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T12:32:10Z\"}"}
