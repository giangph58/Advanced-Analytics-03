{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17259v1\", \"title\": \"Multiobjective Optimization for Robust Holonomic Quantum Gates\", \"summary\": \"Robust pulses have been widely used to reduce the sensitivity of quantum gate\\noperations against various systematic errors due to the imperfections in\\npractical quantum control. Yet, the typical optimization focuses on minimizing\\none type of errors serving as the one-objective algorithm, which arises a more\\nsusceptible sensitivity to other error sources. Optimizing multiple conflicting\\nobjectives of errors simultaneously remains a big challenge in quantum\\ncomputing. Here, we propose a multiobjective optimization algorithm to achieve\\nnonadiabatic holonomic quantum gates with enhanced robustness. We show that by\\nconsidering the amplitude error, the detuning error and the decoherence of the\\nRydberg state as three individual objectives to be minimized, this algorithm\\ncan effectively balance multiple competing objectives, giving rise to a set of\\nPareto optimal solutions. We apply the Entropy Weight method to select the best\\nsolution that implements the robust holonomic gates, outperforming existing\\noptimal gates with one-objective by having both higher gate fidelity and\\nstronger robustness. This numerical approach of optimizing gates with multiple\\nobjectives can be readily applied to other gate protocols featuring a promising\\nadvance in fault-tolerant quantum computing with Rydberg atoms.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T05:30:22Z\"}"}
