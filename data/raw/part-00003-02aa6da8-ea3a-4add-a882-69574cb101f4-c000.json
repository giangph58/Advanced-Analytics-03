{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05325v1\", \"title\": \"Advanced Stock Market Prediction Using Long Short-Term Memory Networks:\\n  A Comprehensive Deep Learning Framework\", \"summary\": \"Predicting stock market movements remains a persistent challenge due to the\\ninherently volatile, non-linear, and stochastic nature of financial time series\\ndata. This paper introduces a deep learning-based framework employing Long\\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast the closing stock prices of major\\ntechnology firms: Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, listed on NASDAQ.\\nHistorical data was sourced from Yahoo Finance and processed using\\nnormalization and feature engineering techniques. The proposed model achieves a\\nMean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 2.72 on unseen test data,\\nsignificantly outperforming traditional models like ARIMA. To further enhance\\npredictive accuracy, sentiment scores were integrated using real-time news\\narticles and social media data, analyzed through the VADER sentiment analysis\\ntool. A web application was also developed to provide real-time visualizations\\nof stock price forecasts, offering practical utility for both individual and\\ninstitutional investors. This research demonstrates the strength of LSTM\\nnetworks in modeling complex financial sequences and presents a novel hybrid\\napproach combining time series modeling with sentiment analysis.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CE\", \"categories\": \"cs.CE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:10:49Z\"}"}
