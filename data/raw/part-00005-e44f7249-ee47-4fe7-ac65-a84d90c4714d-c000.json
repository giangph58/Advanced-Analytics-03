{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05067v1\", \"title\": \"Cross-Problem Solving for Network Optimization: Is Problem-Aware\\n  Learning the Key?\", \"summary\": \"As intelligent network services continue to diversify, ensuring efficient and\\nadaptive resource allocation in edge networks has become increasingly critical.\\nYet the wide functional variations across services often give rise to new and\\nunforeseen optimization problems, rendering traditional manual modeling and\\nsolver design both time-consuming and inflexible. This limitation reveals a key\\ngap between current methods and human solving - the inability to recognize and\\nunderstand problem characteristics. It raises the question of whether\\nproblem-aware learning can bridge this gap and support effective cross-problem\\ngeneralization. To answer this question, we propose a problem-aware diffusion\\n(PAD) model, which leverages a problem-aware learning framework to enable\\ncross-problem generalization. By explicitly encoding the mathematical\\nformulations of optimization problems into token-level embeddings, PAD empowers\\nthe model to understand and adapt to problem structures. Extensive experiments\\nacross six diverse network optimization problems show that PAD generalizes well\\nto unseen problems while significantly improving solution quality and\\nfeasibility. Meanwhile, an auxiliary constraint-aware module is designed to\\nenforce solution validity further. The experiments reveal that problem-aware\\nlearning is promising for building general-purpose solvers for intelligent\\nnetwork operation and resource management.
