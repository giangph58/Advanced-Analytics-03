Recently, a new class of Floquet topological mode,\\nnamely the $\\\\pi/2$ mode, which carries four-period periodicity and has\\npotential applications in quantum computing, was proposed based on a\\nsquare-root method and realized in an acoustic system. Here we propose a\\nlaser-written waveguide array lattice to realize topological $\\\\pi/2$ modes in\\nphotonics. Our photonic model simulates a square-root periodically driven\\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger model and has a rich phase diagram allowing for the\\nco-existence of conventional zero, $\\\\pi$ modes, and the new $\\\\pi/2$ modes.\\nThrough numerical simulations of the wave equation, we uncover the unique\\nfour-period evolution feature of the $\\\\pi/2$ modes. Our model, which only\\ncontains four waveguides per unit cell and two driving steps, is easy to\\nimplement with current fabrication techniques and may find applications in\\nquantum optics.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T07:13:39Z\"}"}
