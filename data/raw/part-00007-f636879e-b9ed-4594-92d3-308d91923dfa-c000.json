Starting with a general\\nformulation for any smooth surface, we apply it to a prolate ellipsoid, which\\nis inspired by recent bubble trap experiments. Using a perturbative approach to\\nthe Gross-Pitaevskii equation and a general Ansatz, followed by a dimensional\\nreduction, we derive an effective two-dimensional equation that includes a\\ncurvature-dependent geometric potential. We compute the ground state using\\nThomas-Fermi approximation and, for an isotropic confinement, we find that the\\nhighest accumulation of atoms happens on the regions with the greatest\\ndifference between the principal curvatures. For a prolate ellipsoid, this\\naccumulation happens on the equator, which is contrary to previous findings\\nthat describe accumulation on the poles of a bubble trap. Finally, we explain\\nthe reasons for this difference: the higher accumulation of atoms on the poles\\nhappens due to anisotropies in the confinement, while the higher accumulation\\non the equator happens exclusively due to the geometric properties of the\\nsurface.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:32:10Z\"}"}
