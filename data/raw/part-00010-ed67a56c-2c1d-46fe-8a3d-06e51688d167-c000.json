{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11149v1\", \"title\": \"An Application of Membrane Computing to Humanitarian Relief via\\n  Generalized Nash Equilibrium\", \"summary\": \"Natural and political disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, and\\ntsunamis, but also migration and refugees crisis, need quick and coordinated\\nresponses in order to support vulnerable populations. In such disasters,\\nnongovernmental organizations compete with each other for financial donations,\\nwhile people who need assistance suffer a lack of coordination, congestion in\\nterms of logistics, and duplication of services. From a theoretical point of\\nview, this problem can be formalized as a Generalized Nash Equilibrium (GNE)\\nproblem. This is a generalization of the Nash equilibrium problem, where the\\nagents' strategies are not fixed but depend on the other agents' strategies. In\\nthis paper, we show that Membrane Computing can model humanitarian relief as a\\nGNE problem. We propose a family of P systems that compute GNE in this context,\\nand we illustrate their capabilities with Hurricane Katrina in 2005 as a case\\nstudy.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GT\", \"categories\": \"cs.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T12:53:01Z\"}"}
