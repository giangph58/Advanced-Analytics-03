{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10353v1\", \"title\": \"Patch and Shuffle: A Preprocessing Technique for Texture Classification\\n  in Autonomous Cementitious Fabrication\", \"summary\": \"Autonomous fabrication systems are transforming construction and\\nmanufacturing, yet they remain vulnerable to print errors. Texture\\nclassification is a key component of computer vision systems that enable\\nreal-time monitoring and adjustment during cementitious fabrication.\\nTraditional classification methods often rely on global image features, which\\ncan bias the model toward semantic content rather than low-level textures. In\\nthis paper, we introduce a novel preprocessing technique called \\\"patch and\\nshuffle,\\\" which segments input images into smaller patches, shuffles them, and\\nreconstructs a jumbled image before classification. This transformation removes\\nsemantic context, forcing the classifier to rely on local texture features.\\n  We evaluate this approach on a dataset of extruded cement images, using a\\nResNet-18-based architecture. Our experiments compare the patch and shuffle\\nmethod to a standard pipeline, holding all other factors constant. Results show\\na significant improvement in accuracy: the patch and shuffle model achieved\\n90.64% test accuracy versus 72.46% for the baseline. These findings suggest\\nthat disrupting global structure enhances performance in texture-based\\nclassification tasks.\\n  This method has implications for broader vision tasks where low-level\\nfeatures matter more than high-level semantics. The technique may improve\\nclassification in applications ranging from fabrication monitoring to medical\\nimaging.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:03:21Z\"}"}
