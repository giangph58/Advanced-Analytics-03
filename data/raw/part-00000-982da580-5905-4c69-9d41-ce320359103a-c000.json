{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21446v1\", \"title\": \"Anti-Intercept OFDM Waveform Design with Secure Coding for Satellite\\n  Networks\", \"summary\": \"Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks are integral to next-generation\\ncommunication systems, providing global coverage, low latency, and minimal\\nsignal loss. However, their unique characteristics, such as constrained onboard\\nresources, Line-of-Sight (LoS) propagation, and vulnerability to eavesdropping\\nover wide coverage areas, present significant challenges to physical layer\\nsecurity. To address these challenges, this paper focuses on the design of\\nanti-intercept waveforms for satellite-ground links within Orthogonal Frequency\\nDivision Multiplexing (OFDM) systems, aiming to enhance security against\\neavesdropping threats. We formulate a secrecy rate maximization problem that\\naims to balance secrecy performance and communication reliability under\\neavesdropping constraints and sub-carrier power limitations. To solve this\\nnon-convex optimization problem, we propose a bisection search-activated neural\\nnetwork (BSA-Net) that integrates unsupervised learning for secure coding\\noptimization and bisection search for dynamic power allocation. The proposed\\nmethod is structured in two stages: the first optimizes secure coding under\\npower constraints, while the second allocates power across sub-carriers under\\neavesdropping constraints. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the\\nefficacy of our approach, showcasing significant improvements in secrecy rate\\nperformance.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T09:05:08Z\"}"}
