{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01803v1\", \"title\": \"DISINFOX: an open-source threat exchange platform serving intelligence\\n  on disinformation and influence operations\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces DISINFOX, an open-source threat intelligence exchange\\nplatform for the structured collection, management, and dissemination of\\ndisinformation incidents and influence operations. Analysts can upload and\\ncorrelate information manipulation and interference incidents, while clients\\ncan access and analyze the data through an interactive web interface or\\nprogrammatically via a public API. This facilitates integration with other\\nvendors, providing a unified view of cybersecurity and disinformation events.\\n  The solution is fully containerized using Docker, comprising a web-based\\nfrontend for user interaction, a backend REST API for managing core\\nfunctionalities, and a public API for structured data retrieval, enabling\\nseamless integration with existing Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) workflows.\\nIn particular, DISINFOX models the incidents through DISARM Tactics,\\nTechniques, and Procedures (TTPs), a MITRE ATT&CK-like framework for\\ndisinformation, with a custom data model based on the Structured Threat\\nInformation eXpression (STIX2) standard.\\n  As an open-source solution, DISINFOX provides a reproducible and extensible\\nhub for researchers, analysts, and policymakers seeking to enhance the\\ndetection, investigation, and mitigation of disinformation threats. The\\nintelligence generated from a custom dataset has been tested and utilized by a\\nlocal instance of OpenCTI, a mature CTI platform, via a custom-built connector,\\nvalidating the platform with the exchange of more than 100 disinformation\\nincidents.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:11:43Z\"}"}
