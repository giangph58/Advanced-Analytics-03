{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12841v1\", \"title\": \"ALT: A Python Package for Lightweight Feature Representation in Time\\n  Series Classification\", \"summary\": \"We introduce ALT, an open-source Python package created for efficient and\\naccurate time series classification (TSC). The package implements the adaptive\\nlaw-based transformation (ALT) algorithm, which transforms raw time series data\\ninto a linearly separable feature space using variable-length shifted time\\nwindows. This adaptive approach enhances its predecessor, the linear law-based\\ntransformation (LLT), by effectively capturing patterns of varying temporal\\nscales. The software is implemented for scalability, interpretability, and ease\\nof use, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational\\noverhead. Extensive benchmarking on real-world datasets demonstrates the\\nutility of ALT for diverse TSC tasks in physics and related domains.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.CV,cs.MS,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T10:57:29Z\"}"}
