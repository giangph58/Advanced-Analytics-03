By\\nimposing the Raychaudhuri equation, we obtain its constrained symplectic form\\nusing the covariant phase space formalism and derive the relevant quantum\\ncommutators by inverting the symplectic form and quantizing. Finally, we\\ncompute the area fluctuations of the causal diamond by taking a Carrollian\\nlimit of the stretched horizon in pure Minkowski spacetime, and derive the\\nrelationship $\\\\langle (\\\\Delta A)^2 \\\\rangle \\\\geq \\\\frac{2\\\\pi G}{d}\\\\langle A\\n\\\\rangle$, showing that the variance of the area fluctuations is proportional to\\nthe area itself.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T17:44:56Z\"}"}
