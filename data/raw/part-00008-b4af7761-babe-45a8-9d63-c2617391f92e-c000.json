{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11924v1\", \"title\": \"Topological Analysis of Mixer Activities in the Bitcoin Network\", \"summary\": \"Cryptocurrency users increasingly rely on obfuscation techniques such as\\nmixers, swappers, and decentralised or no-KYC exchanges to protect their\\nanonymity. However, at the same time, these services are exploited by criminals\\nto conceal and launder illicit funds. Among obfuscation services, mixers remain\\none of the most challenging entities to tackle. This is because their owners\\nare often unwilling to cooperate with Law Enforcement Agencies, and\\ntechnically, they operate as 'black boxes'. To better understand their\\nfunctionalities, this paper proposes an approach to analyse the operations of\\nmixers by examining their address-transaction graphs and identifying\\ntopological similarities to uncover common patterns that can define the mixer's\\nmodus operandi. The approach utilises community detection algorithms to extract\\ndense topological structures and clustering algorithms to group similar\\ncommunities. The analysis is further enriched by incorporating data from\\nexternal sources related to known Exchanges, in order to understand their role\\nin mixer operations. The approach is applied to dissect the Blender.io mixer\\nactivities within the Bitcoin blockchain, revealing: i) consistent structural\\npatterns across address-transaction graphs; ii) that Exchanges play a key role,\\nfollowing a well-established pattern, which raises several concerns about their\\nAML/KYC policies. This paper represents an initial step toward dissecting and\\nunderstanding the complex nature of mixer operations in cryptocurrency networks\\nand extracting their modus operandi.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.CE,cs.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T09:58:59Z\"}"}
