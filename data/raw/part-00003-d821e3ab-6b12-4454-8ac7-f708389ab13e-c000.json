{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01372v1\", \"title\": \"SCNR Maximization for MIMO ISAC Assisted by Fluid Antenna System\", \"summary\": \"The integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology has been\\nextensively researched to enhance communication rates and radar sensing\\ncapabilities. Additionally, a new technology known as fluid antenna system\\n(FAS) has recently been proposed to obtain higher communication rates for\\nfuture wireless networks by dynamically altering the antenna position to obtain\\na more favorable channel condition. The application of the FAS technology in\\nISAC scenarios holds significant research potential. In this paper, we\\ninvestigate a FAS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) ISAC system\\nfor maximizing the radar sensing signal-clutter-noise ratio (SCNR) under\\ncommunication signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and antenna\\nposition constraints. We devise an iterative algorithm that tackles the\\noptimization problem by maximizing a lower bound of SCNR with respect to the\\ntransmit precoding matrix and the antenna position. By addressing the\\nnon-convexity of the problem through this iterative approach, our method\\nsignificantly improves the SCNR. Our simulation results demonstrate that the\\nproposed scheme achieves a higher SCNR compared to the baselines.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T05:34:18Z\"}"}
