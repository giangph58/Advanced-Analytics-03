{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20756v1\", \"title\": \"Graph-Based Fault Diagnosis for Rotating Machinery: Adaptive\\n  Segmentation and Structural Feature Integration\", \"summary\": \"This paper proposes a novel graph-based framework for robust and\\ninterpretable multiclass fault diagnosis in rotating machinery. The method\\nintegrates entropy-optimized signal segmentation, time-frequency feature\\nextraction, and graph-theoretic modeling to transform vibration signals into\\nstructured representations suitable for classification. Graph metrics, such as\\naverage shortest path length, modularity, and spectral gap, are computed and\\ncombined with local features to capture global and segment-level fault\\ncharacteristics. The proposed method achieves high diagnostic accuracy when\\nevaluated on two benchmark datasets, the CWRU bearing dataset (under 0-3 HP\\nloads) and the SU gearbox and bearing datasets (under different speed-load\\nconfigurations). Classification scores reach up to 99.8% accuracy on Case\\nWestern Reserve University (CWRU) and 100% accuracy on the Southeast University\\ndatasets using a logistic regression classifier. Furthermore, the model\\nexhibits strong noise resilience, maintaining over 95.4% accuracy at high noise\\nlevels (standard deviation = 0.5), and demonstrates excellent cross-domain\\ntransferability with up to 99.7% F1-score in load-transfer scenarios. Compared\\nto traditional techniques, this approach requires no deep learning\\narchitecture, enabling lower complexity while ensuring interpretability. The\\nresults confirm the method's scalability, reliability, and potential for\\nreal-time deployment in industrial diagnostics.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:34:52Z\"}"}
