{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01677v1\", \"title\": \"System Level Synthesis for Affine Control Policies: Model Based and\\n  Data-Driven Settings\", \"summary\": \"There is an increasing need for effective control of systems with complex\\ndynamics, particularly through data-driven approaches. System Level Synthesis\\n(SLS) has emerged as a powerful framework that facilitates the control of\\nlarge-scale systems while accounting for model uncertainties. SLS approaches\\nare currently limited to linear systems and time-varying linear control\\npolicies, thus limiting the class of achievable control strategies. We\\nintroduce a novel closed-loop parameterization for time-varying affine control\\npolicies, extending the SLS framework to a broader class of systems and\\npolicies. We show that the closed-loop behavior under affine policies can be\\nequivalently characterized using past system trajectories, enabling a fully\\ndata-driven formulation. This parameterization seamlessly integrates affine\\npolicies into optimal control problems, allowing for a closed-loop formulation\\nof general Model Predictive Control (MPC) problems. To the best of our\\nknowledge, this is the first work to extend SLS to affine policies in both\\nmodel-based and data-driven settings, enabling an equivalent formulation of MPC\\nproblems using closed-loop maps. We validate our approach through numerical\\nexperiments, demonstrating that our model-based and data-driven affine SLS\\nformulations achieve performance on par with traditional model-based MPC.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:26:20Z\"}"}
