{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20910v1\", \"title\": \"When Testing AI Tests Us: Safeguarding Mental Health on the Digital\\n  Frontlines\", \"summary\": \"Red-teaming is a core part of the infrastructure that ensures that AI models\\ndo not produce harmful content. Unlike past technologies, the black box nature\\nof generative AI systems necessitates a uniquely interactional mode of testing,\\none in which individuals on red teams actively interact with the system,\\nleveraging natural language to simulate malicious actors and solicit harmful\\noutputs. This interactional labor done by red teams can result in mental health\\nharms that are uniquely tied to the adversarial engagement strategies necessary\\nto effectively red team. The importance of ensuring that generative AI models\\ndo not propagate societal or individual harm is widely recognized -- one less\\nvisible foundation of end-to-end AI safety is also the protection of the mental\\nhealth and wellbeing of those who work to keep model outputs safe. In this\\npaper, we argue that the unmet mental health needs of AI red-teamers is a\\ncritical workplace safety concern. Through analyzing the unique mental health\\nimpacts associated with the labor done by red teams, we propose potential\\nindividual and organizational strategies that could be used to meet these\\nneeds, and safeguard the mental health of red-teamers. We develop our proposed\\nstrategies through drawing parallels between common red-teaming practices and\\ninteractional labor common to other professions (including actors, mental\\nhealth professionals, conflict photographers, and content moderators),\\ndescribing how individuals and organizations within these professional spaces\\nsafeguard their mental health given similar psychological demands. Drawing on\\nthese protective practices, we describe how safeguards could be adapted for the\\ndistinct mental health challenges experienced by red teaming organizations as\\nthey mitigate emerging technological risks on the new digital frontlines.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY,cs.AI,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T16:27:20Z\"}"}
