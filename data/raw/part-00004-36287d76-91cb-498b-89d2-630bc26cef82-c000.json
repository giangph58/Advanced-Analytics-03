{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11959v1\", \"title\": \"A Koopman Operator Approach to Data-Driven Control of Semilinear\\n  Parabolic Systems\", \"summary\": \"This paper is concerned with the data-driven stabilization of unknown\\nboundary controlled semilinear parabolic systems. The nonlinear dynamics of the\\nsystem are lifted using a finite number of eigenfunctionals of the Koopman\\noperator related to the autonomous semilinear PDE. This results in a novel\\ndata-driven finite-dimensional model of the lifted dynamics, which is amenable\\nto apply design procedures for finite-dimensional systems to stabilize the\\nsemilinear parabolic system. In order to facilitate this, a bilinearization of\\nthe lifted dynamics is considered and feedback linearization is applied for the\\ndata-driven stabilization of the semilinear parabolic PDE. This reveals a novel\\nconnection between the assignment of eigenfunctionals to the closed-loop\\nKoopman operator and feedback linearization. By making use of a modal\\nrepresentation, exponential stability of the closed-loop system in the presence\\nof errors resulting from the data-driven computation of eigenfunctionals and\\nthe bilinearization is verified. The data-driven controller directly follows\\nfrom applying generalized eDMD to state data available for the semilinear\\nparabolic PDE. An example of an unstable semilinear reaction-diffusion system\\nwith finite-time blow up demonstrates the novel data-driven stabilization\\napproach.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T10:41:45Z\"}"}
