Here,\\nfive previously unreported NC Re-based MEA-HEA superconductors with an\\n$\\\\alpha$-Mn lattice are successfully synthesized, with their superconducting\\ntransition temperatures (Tcs) ranging from 4 to 5 K. An increase in the\\nsuperconducting transition temperature (Tc) can be achieved by modulating the\\nvalence electron count (VEC) through compositional adjustments. Magnetization\\nmeasurements confirm that all the synthesized Re-based MEA-HEAs are bulk\\ntype-II superconductors. Specific heat analysis reveals that the\\nsuperconducting state of these HEAs can be well described by a single-gap\\ns-wave model. Our results show that the Kadowaki-Woods ratio of these\\n$\\\\alpha$-Mn MEA/HEA superconductors are close to the typical value of heavy\\nfermion compounds, suggesting the existence of strong electronic correlation.\\nThese findings provide promising material platforms to study the role of high\\ndisorder in the origin of superconductivity in the NC MEAs-HEAs.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T13:12:45Z\"}"}
