By collecting large amounts of input-output data, where inputs\\nrepresent system states and outputs are MPC-generated control actions, NNs can\\nbe trained to replicate MPC behavior at a fraction of the computational cost.\\nHowever, although the composition of the training data critically influences\\nthe final NN accuracy, methods for systematically optimizing it remain\\nunderexplored. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Optimally-Sampled\\nDatasets (OSDs) as ideal training sets and present an efficient algorithm for\\ngenerating them. An OSD is a parametrized subset of all the available data that\\n(i) preserves existing MPC information up to a certain numerical resolution,\\n(ii) avoids duplicate or near-duplicate states, and (iii) becomes saturated or\\ncomplete. We demonstrate the effectiveness of OSDs by training NNs to replicate\\nthe University of Virginia's MPC algorithm for automated insulin delivery in\\nType-1 Diabetes, achieving a four-fold improvement in final accuracy. Notably,\\ntwo OSD-trained NNs received regulatory clearance for clinical testing as the\\nfirst NN-based control algorithm for direct human insulin dosing. This\\nmethodology opens new pathways for implementing advanced optimizations on\\nresource-constrained embedded platforms, potentially revolutionizing how\\ncomplex algorithms are deployed.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.AI,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:25:06Z\"}"}
