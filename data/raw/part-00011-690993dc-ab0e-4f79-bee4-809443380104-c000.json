{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16010v1\", \"title\": \"The Formation of Production Networks: How Supply Chains Arise from\\n  Simple Learning with Minimal Information\", \"summary\": \"We develop a model where firms determine the price at which they sell their\\ndifferentiable goods, the volume that they produce, and the inputs (types and\\namounts) that they purchase from other firms. A steady-state production network\\nemerges endogenously without resorting to assumptions such as equilibrium or\\nperfect knowledge about production technologies. Through a simple version of\\nreinforcement learning, firms with heterogeneous technologies cope with\\nuncertainty and maximize profits. Due to this learning process, firms can adapt\\nto shocks such as demand shifts, suppliers/clients closure, productivity\\nchanges, and production technology modifications; effectively reshaping the\\nproduction network. To demonstrate the potential of this model, we analyze the\\nupstream and downstream impact of demand and productivity shocks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MA\", \"categories\": \"cs.MA,cs.LG,econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T16:18:19Z\"}"}
