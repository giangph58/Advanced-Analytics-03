{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21325v1\", \"title\": \"Text-Conditioned Diffusion Model for High-Fidelity Korean Font\\n  Generation\", \"summary\": \"Automatic font generation (AFG) is the process of creating a new font using\\nonly a few examples of the style images. Generating fonts for complex languages\\nlike Korean and Chinese, particularly in handwritten styles, presents\\nsignificant challenges. Traditional AFGs, like Generative adversarial networks\\n(GANs) and Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs), are usually unstable during\\ntraining and often face mode collapse problems. They also struggle to capture\\nfine details within font images. To address these problems, we present a\\ndiffusion-based AFG method which generates high-quality, diverse Korean font\\nimages using only a single reference image, focusing on handwritten and printed\\nstyles. Our approach refines noisy images incrementally, ensuring stable\\ntraining and visually appealing results. A key innovation is our text encoder,\\nwhich processes phonetic representations to generate accurate and contextually\\ncorrect characters, even for unseen characters. We used a pre-trained style\\nencoder from DG FONT to effectively and accurately encode the style images. To\\nfurther enhance the generation quality, we used perceptual loss that guides the\\nmodel to focus on the global style of generated images. Experimental results on\\nover 2000 Korean characters demonstrate that our model consistently generates\\naccurate and detailed font images and outperforms benchmark methods, making it\\na reliable tool for generating authentic Korean fonts across different styles.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T05:24:49Z\"}"}
