{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16725v1\", \"title\": \"Quantum sensing with spin defects in boron nitride nanotubes\", \"summary\": \"Spin defects in semiconductors are widely investigated for various\\napplications in quantum sensing. Conventional host materials such as diamond\\nand hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) provide bulk or low-dimensional platforms for\\noptically addressable spin systems, but often lack the structural properties\\nneeded for chemical sensing. Here, we introduce a new class of quantum sensors\\nbased on naturally occurring spin defects in boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs),\\nwhich combine high surface area with omnidirectional spin control, key features\\nfor enhanced sensing performance. First, we present strong evidence that these\\ndefects are carbon-related, akin to recently identified centers in hBN, and\\ndemonstrate coherent spin control over ensembles embedded within dense,\\nmicroscale BNNTs networks. Using dynamical decoupling, we enhance spin\\ncoherence times by a factor exceeding 300x and implement high-resolution\\ndetection of radiofrequency signals. By integrating the BNNT mesh sensor into a\\nmicrofluidic platform we demonstrate chemical sensing of paramagnetic ions in\\nsolution, with detectable concentrations reaching levels nearly 1000 times\\nlower than previously demonstrated using comparable hBN-based systems. This\\nhighly porous and flexible architecture positions BNNTs as a powerful new host\\nmaterial for quantum sensing.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.app-ph,physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T13:55:20Z\"}"}
