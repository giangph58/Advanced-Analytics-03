Acoustic resonators are built on 600 nm thick\\ntransferred stoichiometric LN on silicon wafers with 40 nm thick platinum (Pt)\\nelectrodes, selected for high temperature operation. The fabricated resonators\\nare first annealed at 250 {\\\\deg}C, and the anneal temperature is incrementally\\nincreased to 550 {\\\\deg}C after 7 rounds of annealing. The annealing is shown to\\nupshift resonant frequencies and can increase the quality factor (Q), within a\\ntemperature range, before it gradually damages the device performance. This\\nwork presents promising results for using the suspended thin-film LN platform\\nfor resonators, sensors, and transducers in harsh thermal environments.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T15:05:21Z\"}"}
