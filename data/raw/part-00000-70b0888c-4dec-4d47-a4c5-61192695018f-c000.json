As a measure of the efficiency of mixed transportation, we consider the\\nreduction rate that represents how much the total distance of loading trips is\\nshortened by cooperation. The proposed algorithm instantly presents the set of\\nall mixed transports with a reduction rate of a specified value or less. This\\nalgorithm is more than 7,000 times faster than simple brute force.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GT\", \"categories\": \"cs.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:55:24Z\"}"}
