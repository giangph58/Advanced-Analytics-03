{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17733v1\", \"title\": \"Fuzzy clustering and community detection: an integrated approach\", \"summary\": \"This paper addresses the ambitious goal of merging two different approaches\\nto group detection in complex domains: one based on fuzzy clustering and the\\nother on community detection theory. To achieve this, two clustering algorithms\\nare proposed: Fuzzy C-Medoids Clustering with Modularity Spatial Correction and\\nFuzzy C-Modes Clustering with Modularity Spatial Correction. The former is\\ndesigned for quantitative data, while the latter is intended for qualitative\\ndata. The concept of fuzzy modularity is introduced into the standard objective\\nfunction of fuzzy clustering algorithms as a spatial regularization term, whose\\ncontribution to the clustering criterion based on attributes is controlled by\\nan exogenous parameter. An extensive simulation study is conducted to support\\nthe theoretical framework, complemented by two applications to real-world data\\nrelated to the theme of sustainability. The first application involves data\\nfrom the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, while the second focuses on\\nurban green spaces in Italian provincial capitals and metropolitan cities. Both\\nthe simulation results and the applications demonstrate the advantages of this\\nnew methodological proposal.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.CO\", \"categories\": \"stat.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T16:47:17Z\"}"}
