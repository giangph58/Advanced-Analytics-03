{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23705v1\", \"title\": \"Steering Large Agent Populations using Mean-Field Schrodinger Bridges\\n  with Gaussian Mixture Models\", \"summary\": \"The Mean-Field Schrodinger Bridge (MFSB) problem is an optimization problem\\naiming to find the minimum effort control policy to drive a McKean-Vlassov\\nstochastic differential equation from one probability measure to another. In\\nthe context of multiagent control, the objective is to control the\\nconfiguration of a swarm of identical, interacting cooperative agents, as\\ncaptured by the time-varying probability measure of their state. Available\\nmethods for solving this problem for distributions with continuous support rely\\neither on spatial discretizations of the problem's domain or on approximating\\noptimal solutions using neural networks trained through stochastic optimization\\nschemes. For agents following Linear Time-Varying dynamics, and for Gaussian\\nMixture Model boundary distributions, we propose a highly efficient\\nparameterization to approximate the solutions of the corresponding MFSB in\\nclosed form, without any learning steps. Our proposed approach consists of a\\nmixture of elementary policies, each solving a Gaussian-to-Gaussian Covariance\\nSteering problem from the components of the initial to the components of the\\nterminal mixture. Leveraging the semidefinite formulation of the Covariance\\nSteering problem, our proposed solver can handle probabilistic hard constraints\\non the system's state, while maintaining numerical tractability. We illustrate\\nour approach on a variety of numerical examples.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T04:01:04Z\"}"}
