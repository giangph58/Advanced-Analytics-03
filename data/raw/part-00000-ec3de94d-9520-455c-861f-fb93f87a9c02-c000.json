{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11379v1\", \"title\": \"Omni$^2$: Unifying Omnidirectional Image Generation and Editing in an\\n  Omni Model\", \"summary\": \"$360^{\\\\circ}$ omnidirectional images (ODIs) have gained considerable\\nattention recently, and are widely used in various virtual reality (VR) and\\naugmented reality (AR) applications. However, capturing such images is\\nexpensive and requires specialized equipment, making ODI synthesis increasingly\\nimportant. While common 2D image generation and editing methods are rapidly\\nadvancing, these models struggle to deliver satisfactory results when\\ngenerating or editing ODIs due to the unique format and broad 360$^{\\\\circ}$\\nField-of-View (FoV) of ODIs. To bridge this gap, we construct\\n\\\\textbf{\\\\textit{Any2Omni}}, the first comprehensive ODI generation-editing\\ndataset comprises 60,000+ training data covering diverse input conditions and\\nup to 9 ODI generation and editing tasks. Built upon Any2Omni, we propose an\\n\\\\textbf{\\\\underline{Omni}} model for \\\\textbf{\\\\underline{Omni}}-directional image\\ngeneration and editing (\\\\textbf{\\\\textit{Omni$^2$}}), with the capability of\\nhandling various ODI generation and editing tasks under diverse input\\nconditions using one model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority\\nand effectiveness of the proposed Omni$^2$ model for both the ODI generation\\nand editing tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:53:11Z\"}"}
