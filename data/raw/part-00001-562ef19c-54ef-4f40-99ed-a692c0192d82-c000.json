{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16831v1\", \"title\": \"Evaluating Autoencoders for Parametric and Invertible Multidimensional\\n  Projections\", \"summary\": \"Recently, neural networks have gained attention for creating parametric and\\ninvertible multidimensional data projections. Parametric projections allow for\\nembedding previously unseen data without recomputing the projection as a whole,\\nwhile invertible projections enable the generation of new data points. However,\\nthese properties have never been explored simultaneously for arbitrary\\nprojection methods. We evaluate three autoencoder (AE) architectures for\\ncreating parametric and invertible projections. Based on a given projection, we\\ntrain AEs to learn a mapping into 2D space and an inverse mapping into the\\noriginal space. We perform a quantitative and qualitative comparison on four\\ndatasets of varying dimensionality and pattern complexity using t-SNE. Our\\nresults indicate that AEs with a customized loss function can create smoother\\nparametric and inverse projections than feed-forward neural networks while\\ngiving users control over the strength of the smoothing effect.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:47:20Z\"}"}
