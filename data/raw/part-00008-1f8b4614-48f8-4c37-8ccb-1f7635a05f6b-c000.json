Here, we introduce a novel protocol that\\nachieves this goal by measuring phase correlations of AC magnetic fields using\\nensembles of NV centers. Our method extends the sensing dynamic range to\\nfrequencies higher than the system's Rabi frequency while achieving arbitrary\\nfrequency resolution, limited only by the target field coherence time.\\nMoreover, our approach operates more robustly with respect to the magnetic\\nfield's amplitude. Thanks to this robustness, our protocol allows the\\napplication of more $\\\\pi$-pulses in pulse sequences such as CPMG, enabling the\\ndecoupling of a broader range of frequency noise. The higher harmonics\\ngenerated in this process continue to act as a part of the signal, ultimately\\nimproving the frequency resolution. This method paves the way for achieving\\narbitrary frequency resolution with improved performances, making it highly\\nversatile for quantum sensing applications across diverse scientific fields.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T14:48:23Z\"}"}
