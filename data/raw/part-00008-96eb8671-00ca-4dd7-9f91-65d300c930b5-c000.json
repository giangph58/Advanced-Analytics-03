We construct the\\ndifferential graded Lie algebra that governs post-Lie deformations of a pre-Lie\\nalgebra. We also develop the post-Lie cohomology theory for a pre-Lie algebra,\\nby which we classify infinitesimal post-Lie deformations of a pre-Lie algebra\\nusing the second cohomology group. The rigidity of such kind of deformations is\\nalso characterized using the second cohomology group. Finally, we apply this\\ndeformation theory to Regularity Structures. We prove that the post-Lie\\nalgebraic structure on the decorated trees which appears spontaneously in\\nRegularity Structures is a post-Lie deformation of a pre-Lie algebra.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RA\", \"categories\": \"math.RA,math.AP,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T11:12:41Z\"}"}
