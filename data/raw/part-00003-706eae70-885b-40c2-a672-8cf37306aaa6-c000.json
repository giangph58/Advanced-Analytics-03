Public datasets play a vital role in benchmarking and guiding\\nadvancement in research by providing standardized resources for model\\ndevelopment and evaluation. However, potential inaccuracies in sensor\\ncalibration and vehicle poses within these datasets can lead to erroneous\\nevaluations of downstream tasks, adversely impacting the reliability and\\nperformance of the autonomous systems. To address this challenge, we propose a\\nrobust optimization method based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to refine\\nsensor poses and calibration parameters, enhancing the integrity of dataset\\nbenchmarks. To validate improvement in accuracy of our optimized poses without\\nground truth, we present a thorough evaluation process, relying on reprojection\\nmetrics, Novel View Synthesis rendering quality, and geometric alignment. We\\ndemonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in sensor pose\\naccuracy. By optimizing these critical parameters, our approach not only\\nimproves the utility of existing datasets but also paves the way for more\\nreliable autonomous driving models. To foster continued progress in this field,\\nwe make the optimized sensor poses publicly available, providing a valuable\\nresource for the research community.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T10:33:01Z\"}"}
