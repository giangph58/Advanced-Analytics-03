The system is\\nprepared in a ground state of the initial Hamiltonian and the Hamiltonian is\\nsuddenly changed to a different form. We apply the Krylov subspace method to\\nmap the system onto an effective tridiagonal Hamiltonian. The state is confined\\nin a potential well and is time-evolved by nonuniform hoppings. The dynamical\\nsingularities for the survival probability can occur when the state is\\nreflected from a potential barrier. Although we do not observe any singularity\\nin the spread complexity, we find that the entropy exhibits small dips at the\\nsingular times. We find that the presence of metastable state affects long-time\\nbehavior of the spread complexity, and physical observables. We also observe a\\nreduction of the state-space dimension when the Hamiltonian reduces to a\\nclassical form.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T05:58:49Z\"}"}
