{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11014v1\", \"title\": \"GATE3D: Generalized Attention-based Task-synergized Estimation in 3D*\", \"summary\": \"The emerging trend in computer vision emphasizes developing universal models\\ncapable of simultaneously addressing multiple diverse tasks. Such universality\\ntypically requires joint training across multi-domain datasets to ensure\\neffective generalization. However, monocular 3D object detection presents\\nunique challenges in multi-domain training due to the scarcity of datasets\\nannotated with accurate 3D ground-truth labels, especially beyond typical\\nroad-based autonomous driving contexts. To address this challenge, we introduce\\na novel weakly supervised framework leveraging pseudo-labels. Current\\npretrained models often struggle to accurately detect pedestrians in non-road\\nenvironments due to inherent dataset biases. Unlike generalized image-based 2D\\nobject detection models, achieving similar generalization in monocular 3D\\ndetection remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose GATE3D, a novel\\nframework designed specifically for generalized monocular 3D object detection\\nvia weak supervision. GATE3D effectively bridges domain gaps by employing\\nconsistency losses between 2D and 3D predictions. Remarkably, our model\\nachieves competitive performance on the KITTI benchmark as well as on an\\nindoor-office dataset collected by us to evaluate the generalization\\ncapabilities of our framework. Our results demonstrate that GATE3D\\nsignificantly accelerates learning from limited annotated data through\\neffective pre-training strategies, highlighting substantial potential for\\nbroader impacts in robotics, augmented reality, and virtual reality\\napplications.
