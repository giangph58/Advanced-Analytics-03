In particular, we can classify $R_{\\\\Gamma}$ for some typical\\ntypes of graphs, such as lines and cyclic graphs. As an application, we also\\nshow that for two isomorphic graph products of hyperfinite II$_1$-factors over\\nH-rigid graphs, the difference of the radius between the two graphs will not be\\nlarger than 1. Our proof is based on the recent resolution of the Peterson-Thom\\nconjecture.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OA\", \"categories\": \"math.OA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T12:30:22Z\"}"}
