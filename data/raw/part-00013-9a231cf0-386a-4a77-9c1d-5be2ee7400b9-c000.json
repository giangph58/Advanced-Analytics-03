{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24049v1\", \"title\": \"The Linear Collider Facility (LCF) at CERN\", \"summary\": \"In this paper we outline a proposal for a Linear Collider Facility as the\\nnext flagship project for CERN. It offers the opportunity for a timely,\\ncost-effective and staged construction of a new collider that will be able to\\ncomprehensively map the Higgs boson's properties, including the Higgs field\\npotential, thanks to a large span in centre-of-mass energies and polarised\\nbeams. A comprehensive programme to study the Higgs boson and its closest\\nrelatives with high precision requires data at centre-of-mass energies from the\\nZ pole to at least 1 TeV. It should include measurements of the Higgs boson in\\nboth major production mechanisms, ee -> ZH and ee -> vvH, precision\\nmeasurements of gauge boson interactions as well as of the W boson, Higgs boson\\nand top-quark masses, measurement of the top-quark Yukawa coupling through ee\\n->ttH, measurement of the Higgs boson self-coupling through HH production, and\\nprecision measurements of the electroweak couplings of the top quark. In\\naddition, ee collisions offer discovery potential for new particles\\ncomplementary to HL-LHC.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex,physics.acc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:12:13Z\"}"}
