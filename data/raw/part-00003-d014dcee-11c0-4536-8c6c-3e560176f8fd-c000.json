We show that the most of operations in the transformation chain from\\ncontrol variables to effective anisotropic dielectric tensor discretized on the\\nYee grid are expressible in terms of generalized convolutions that can be\\ncomputed efficiently on GPU accelerators. Combined with the recent open-source\\nGPU FDTD code and custom gradient-descent optimizer with dynamic control of\\nfinal design manufacturability, it results in fast inverse design tool capable\\nof producing reliable Si photonic component layouts in minutes/hours instead of\\ndays. The final designs, although not globally optimal, are generally\\nphysically meaningful since they reflect how fields themselves tend to\\npropagate through the device in the most efficient way.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T09:21:02Z\"}"}
