Recent years, AI has witnessed remarkable\\nprogress and spurred scientific discovery. In metasurface design, optical\\ninverse design has recently emerged as a revolutionary approach. It uses deep\\nlearning to create a nonlinear mapping between optical structures and\\nfunctions, bypassing time-consuming traditional design and attaining higher\\naccuracy. Yet, current deep-learning models for optical design face\\nlimitations. They often work only for fixed wavelengths and polarizations, and\\nlack universality as input-output vector size changes may require retraining.\\nThere's also a lack of compatibility across different application scenarios.\\nThis paper introduces MetasurfaceViT, a revolutionary generic AI model. It\\nleverages a large amount of data using Jones matrices and physics-informed data\\naugmentation. By pre-training through masking wavelengths and polarization\\nchannels, it can reconstruct full-wavelength Jones matrices, which will be\\nutilized by fine-tuning model to enable inverse design. Finally, a tandem\\nworkflow appended by a forward prediction network is introduced to evaluate\\nperformance. The versatility of MetasurfaceViT with high prediction accuracy\\nwill open a new paradigm for optical inverse design.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T06:54:43Z\"}"}
