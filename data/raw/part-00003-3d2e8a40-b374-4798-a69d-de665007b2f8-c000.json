A\\ncentral challenge lies in fast fitness evaluations on large training datasets,\\nespecially for complex real-world problems involving time-consuming\\nsimulations. Surrogate models, like phenotypic characterization (PC)-based\\nK-nearest neighbors (KNN), have been applied to reduce computational cost.\\nHowever, the PC-based similarity measure is confined to behavioral\\ncharacteristics, overlooking genotypic differences, which can limit surrogate\\nquality and impair performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes a\\npheno-geno unified surrogate GP algorithm, PGU-SGP, integrating phenotypic and\\ngenotypic characterization (GC) to enhance surrogate sample selection and\\nfitness prediction. A novel unified similarity metric combining PC and GC\\ndistances is proposed, along with an effective and efficient GC representation.\\nExperimental results of a real-life vehicle scheduling problem demonstrate that\\nPGU-SGP reduces training time by approximately 76% while achieving comparable\\nperformance to traditional GP. With the same training time, PGU-SGP\\nsignificantly outperforms traditional GP and the state-of-the-art algorithm on\\nmost datasets. Additionally, PGU-SGP shows faster convergence and improved\\nsurrogate quality by maintaining accurate fitness rankings and appropriate\\nselection pressure, further validating its effectiveness.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NE\", \"categories\": \"cs.NE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:19:42Z\"}"}
