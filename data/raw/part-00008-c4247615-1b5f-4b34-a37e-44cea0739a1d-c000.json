{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00406v1\", \"title\": \"Quantum Littlewood correspondences\", \"summary\": \"In the 1940s Littlewood formulated three fundamental correspondences for the\\nimmanants and Schur symmetric functions on the general linear group, which\\nestablish deep connections between representation theory of the symmetric group\\nand the general linear group parallel to the Schur-Weyl duality. In this paper,\\nwe introduce the notion of quantum immanants in the quantum coordinate algebra\\nusing primitive idempotents of the Hecke algebra. By employing $R$-matrix\\ntechniques, we establish the quantum analog of Littlewood correspondences\\nbetween quantum immanants and Schur functions for the quantum coordinate\\nalgebra. In the setting of the Schur-Weyl-Jimbo duality, we construct an exact\\ncorrespondence between the Gelfand-Tsetlin bases of the irreducible\\nrepresentations of the quantum enveloping algebra $U_q(\\\\mathfrak{gl}(n))$ and\\nYoung's orthonormal basis of an irreducible representation of the Hecke algebra\\n$\\\\mathcal H_m$. This isomorphism leads to our trace formula for the quantum\\nimmanants, which settled the generalization problem\\n  of $q$-analog of Kostant's formular for $\\\\lambda$-immanants. As applications,\\nwe also derive general $q$-Littlewood-Merris-Watkins identities and\\n$q$-Goulden-Jackson identities as special cases of the quantum Littlewood\\ncorrespondence III.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RT\", \"categories\": \"math.RT,math.CO,math.QA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T08:56:33Z\"}"}
