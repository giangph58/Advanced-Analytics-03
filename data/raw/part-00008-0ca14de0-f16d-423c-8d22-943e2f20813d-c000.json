{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21752v1\", \"title\": \"VDDP: Verifiable Distributed Differential Privacy under the\\n  Client-Server-Verifier Setup\", \"summary\": \"Despite differential privacy (DP) often being considered the de facto\\nstandard for data privacy, its realization is vulnerable to unfaithful\\nexecution of its mechanisms by servers, especially in distributed settings.\\nSpecifically, servers may sample noise from incorrect distributions or generate\\ncorrelated noise while appearing to follow established protocols. This work\\nanalyzes these malicious behaviors in a general differential privacy framework\\nwithin a distributed client-server-verifier setup. To address these adversarial\\nproblems, we propose a novel definition called Verifiable Distributed\\nDifferential Privacy (VDDP) by incorporating additional verification\\nmechanisms. We also explore the relationship between zero-knowledge proofs\\n(ZKP) and DP, demonstrating that while ZKPs are sufficient for achieving DP\\nunder verifiability requirements, they are not necessary. Furthermore, we\\ndevelop two novel and efficient mechanisms that satisfy VDDP: (1) the\\nVerifiable Distributed Discrete Laplacian Mechanism (VDDLM), which offers up to\\na $4 \\\\times 10^5$x improvement in proof generation efficiency with only\\n0.1-0.2x error compared to the previous state-of-the-art verifiable\\ndifferentially private mechanism; (2) an improved solution to Verifiable\\nRandomized Response (VRR) under local DP, a special case of VDDP, achieving up\\na reduction of up to 5000x in communication costs and the verifier's overhead.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.DB\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T15:46:55Z\"}"}
