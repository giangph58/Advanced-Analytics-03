{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09943v1\", \"title\": \"The Tropical Atmosphere of Jupiter - Shallow Weather, Deep Plumes, and\\n  Vortices\", \"summary\": \"Towering storms, swirling clouds, and vortices are the cloud tops\\nmanifestation of complex weather systems shaping the atmosphere of Jupiter. We\\nuse observations from Juno's MicroWave Radiometer (MWR), the Very Large Array\\n(VLA) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to probe for the first time the\\ndepth and impact of weather on Jupiter. We use ammonia, the main source of\\nopacity at radio wavelengths on Jupiter, as the tracer for the weather by\\nfitting ammonia anomalies to the MWR brightness temperature variations. We show\\nthat the majority of the weather on Jupiter is confined to regions where the\\nclouds are forming. Both the South Equatorial Belt and the Equatorial Zone have\\nsurprisingly shallow weather systems (P < 2 bar), and even in the North\\nEquatorial Belt most of the ammonia variations is above the water condensation\\nlevel (P ~ 6 bar). This confirms that the water condensation layer plays a\\ncrucial role in controlling the dynamics and the weather on Jupiter. However,\\nthe shallow nature of the weather cannot explain the deep-seated depletion down\\nto 30 bar that the Juno mission has revealed. We do find three features,\\nhowever, that extend below the water condensation layer: a vortex in the\\nnorthern hemisphere reaching down to 30 bar, an ammonia plume down to 20-30\\nbars, and the signature of precipitation down to 20 bar. This work highlights\\nthe interplay of large-scale processes (vortices, plumes) and small-scale\\nprocesses (storms) are responsible for shaping the atmospheric makeup of\\nJupiter.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T07:09:39Z\"}"}
