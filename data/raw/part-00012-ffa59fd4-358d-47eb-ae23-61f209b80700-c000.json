{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07794v1\", \"title\": \"Plan-and-Refine: Diverse and Comprehensive Retrieval-Augmented\\n  Generation\", \"summary\": \"This paper studies the limitations of (retrieval-augmented) large language\\nmodels (LLMs) in generating diverse and comprehensive responses, and introduces\\nthe Plan-and-Refine (P&R) framework based on a two phase system design. In the\\nglobal exploration phase, P&R generates a diverse set of plans for the given\\ninput, where each plan consists of a list of diverse query aspects with\\ncorresponding additional descriptions. This phase is followed by a local\\nexploitation phase that generates a response proposal for the input query\\nconditioned on each plan and iteratively refines the proposal for improving the\\nproposal quality. Finally, a reward model is employed to select the proposal\\nwith the highest factuality and coverage. We conduct our experiments based on\\nthe ICAT evaluation methodology--a recent approach for answer factuality and\\ncomprehensiveness evaluation. Experiments on the two diverse information\\nseeking benchmarks adopted from non-factoid question answering and TREC search\\nresult diversification tasks demonstrate that P&R significantly outperforms\\nbaselines, achieving up to a 13.1% improvement on the ANTIQUE dataset and a\\n15.41% improvement on the TREC dataset. Furthermore, a smaller scale user study\\nconfirms the substantial efficacy of the P&R framework.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:32:32Z\"}"}
