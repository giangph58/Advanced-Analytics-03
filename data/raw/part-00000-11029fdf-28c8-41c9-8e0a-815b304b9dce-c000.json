The members of this family are\\ninteresting in that their existence implies the existence of strata in the\\nThurston spine for which the systoles do not determine a basis for the homology\\nof the surface. Previously, index calculations of critical points with this\\npathological feature were impossible, because the only known examples were in\\nsurfaces with huge genus.\\n  A related concept is that of a ``minimal filling subset'' of the systoles at\\nthe critical point. Such minimal filling sets are studied, as they relate to\\nthe dimension of the Thurston spine near the critical point. We find an example\\nof a minimal filling set of simple closed geodesics in genus 5 with cardinality\\n8, that are presumably realised as systoles. More generally, we determine the\\nsmallest and largest cardinality of a minimal filling set related to a\\ntesselation of a hyperbolic surface by regular, right-angled $m$-gons for $m\\n\\\\in \\\\{ 5, 6, 7 \\\\}$. For this, we use integer linear programming together with a\\nhand-tailored symmetry breaking technique.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GT\", \"categories\": \"math.GT,math.MG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T07:19:10Z\"}"}
