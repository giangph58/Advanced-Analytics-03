The corresponding eleven\\nintegrals of motion in the Liouville-Arnold sense are presented explicitly.\\nSpecifically, it is shown that the reduced Hamiltonian admits complete\\nseparation of variables in Jacobi-like variables. The emergence of this\\nchoreography is not a direct consequence of maximal superintegrability. Rather,\\nit originates from the existence of \\\\textit{particular integrals} and the\\nphenomenon of \\\\textit{particular involution}. The fragmentation of a more\\ngeneral four-body choreographic motion into two isomorphic two-body\\nchoreographies is discussed in detail. This model combines choreographic motion\\nwith maximal superintegrability, a seldom-studied interplay in classical\\nmechanics.\", \"main_category\": \"math-ph\", \"categories\": \"math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T04:16:50Z\"}"}
