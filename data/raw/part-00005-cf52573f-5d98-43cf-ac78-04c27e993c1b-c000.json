{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06744v1\", \"title\": \"More Efficient Stealth Address Protocol\", \"summary\": \"The integration of privacy-preserving transactions into public blockchains\\nsuch as Ethereum remains a major challenge. The Stealth Address Protocol (SAP)\\nprovides recipient anonymity by generating unlinkable stealth addresses.\\nExisting SAPs, such as the Dual-Key Stealth Address Protocol and the Curvy\\nProtocol, have shown significant improvements in efficiency, but remain\\nvulnerable to quantum attacks. Post-quantum SAPs based on lattice-based\\ncryptography, such as the Module-LWE SAP, on the other hand, offer quantum\\nresistance while achieving better performance.\\n  In this paper, we present a novel hybrid SAP that combines the Curvy protocol\\nwith the computational advantages of the Module-LWE technique while remaining\\nEthereum-friendly. In contrast to full post-quantum solutions, our approach\\ndoes not provide quantum security, but achieves a significant speedup in\\nscanning the ephemeral public key registry, about three times faster than the\\nCurvy protocol. We present a detailed cryptographic construction of our\\nprotocol and compare its performance with existing solutions. Our results prove\\nthat this hybrid approach is the most efficient Ethereum-compatible SAP to\\ndate.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T10:01:24Z\"}"}
