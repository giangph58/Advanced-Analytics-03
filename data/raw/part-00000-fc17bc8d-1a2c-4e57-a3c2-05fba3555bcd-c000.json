{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15057v1\", \"title\": \"Linear Item-Item Model with Neural Knowledge for Session-based\\n  Recommendation\", \"summary\": \"Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims to predict users' subsequent actions\\nby modeling short-term interactions within sessions. Existing neural models\\nprimarily focus on capturing complex dependencies for sequential item\\ntransitions. As an alternative solution, linear item-item models mainly\\nidentify strong co-occurrence patterns across items and support faster\\ninference speed. Although each paradigm has been actively studied in SBR, their\\nfundamental differences in capturing item relationships and how to bridge these\\ndistinct modeling paradigms effectively remain unexplored. In this paper, we\\npropose a novel SBR model, namely Linear Item-Item model with Neural Knowledge\\n(LINK), which integrates both types of knowledge into a unified linear\\nframework. Specifically, we design two specialized components of LINK: (i)\\nLinear knowledge-enhanced Item-item Similarity model (LIS), which refines the\\nitem similarity correlation via self-distillation, and (ii) Neural\\nknowledge-enhanced Item-item Transition model (NIT), which seamlessly\\nincorporates complicated neural knowledge distilled from the off-the-shelf\\nneural model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LINK outperforms\\nstate-of-the-art linear SBR models across six real-world datasets, achieving\\nimprovements of up to 14.78% and 11.04% in Recall@20 and MRR@20 while showing\\nup to 813x fewer inference FLOPs.
