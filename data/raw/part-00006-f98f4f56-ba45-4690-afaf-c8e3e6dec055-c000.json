{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02595v1\", \"title\": \"Native defects, hydrogen impurities, and metal dopants in CeO$_2$\", \"summary\": \"Ceria (CeO$_2$) is a material of significant technological importance. A\\ndetailed understanding of the material's defect physics and chemistry is key to\\nunderstanding and optimizing its properties. Here, we report a hybrid\\ndensity-functional study of native point defects, hydrogen impurities, and\\nmetal dopants in CeO$_2$. We find that electron polarons ($\\\\eta_{\\\\rm Ce}^-$)\\nand oxygen vacancies ($V_{\\\\rm O}^{2+}$) are the dominant native defects under\\nconditions ranging from extreme oxidizing to highly reducing. Hydrogen is\\nstable either in the hydroxyl (H$_i^+$) or hydride (H$_{\\\\rm O}^+$) structure\\nbut the substitutional H$_{\\\\rm O}^+$ is energetically more favorable than\\nH$_i^+$ only under highly reducing conditions. The interstitial H$_i^+$ is\\nhighly mobile in the bulk. Yttrium (Y) is energetically most favorable at the\\nsubstitutional Ce site. Copper (Cu) and nickel (Ni) can be incorporated at the\\nsubstitutional site and/or an interstitial site, depending on actual conditions\\nduring preparation, and the dopants can exist in different charge and spin\\nstates. In light of the results, we discuss electronic and ionic conduction and\\nthe effects of metal doping on the formation of electron polarons and oxygen\\nvacancies.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T13:57:18Z\"}"}
