{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03547v1\", \"title\": \"STORY2GAME: Generating (Almost) Everything in an Interactive Fiction\\n  Game\", \"summary\": \"We introduce STORY2GAME, a novel approach to using Large Language Models to\\ngenerate text-based interactive fiction games that starts by generating a\\nstory, populates the world, and builds the code for actions in a game engine\\nthat enables the story to play out interactively. Whereas a given set of\\nhard-coded actions can artificially constrain story generation, the ability to\\ngenerate actions means the story generation process can be more open-ended but\\nstill allow for experiences that are grounded in a game state. The key to\\nsuccessful action generation is to use LLM-generated preconditions and effects\\nof actions in the stories as guides for what aspects of the game state must be\\ntracked and changed by the game engine when a player performs an action. We\\nalso introduce a technique for dynamically generating new actions to\\naccommodate the player's desire to perform actions that they think of that are\\nnot part of the story. Dynamic action generation may require on-the-fly updates\\nto the game engine's state representation and revision of previously generated\\nactions. We evaluate the success rate of action code generation with respect to\\nwhether a player can interactively play through the entire generated story.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T14:00:41Z\"}"}
