Network slicing within O-RAN allows network\\noperators to create customized virtual networks, each tailored to meet the\\nspecific needs of a particular application or service. Efficiently managing\\nthese slices is crucial for future 6G networks. O-RAN introduces specialized\\nsoftware applications called xApps that manage different network functions. In\\nnetwork slicing, an xApp can be responsible for managing a separate network\\nslice. To optimize resource allocation across numerous network slices, these\\nxApps must coordinate. Traditional methods where all xApps communicate freely\\ncan lead to excessive overhead, hindering network performance. In this paper,\\nwe address the issue of xApp conflict mitigation by proposing an innovative\\nZero-Touch Management (ZTM) solution for radio resource management in O-RAN.\\nOur approach leverages Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to enable\\nxApps to learn and optimize resource allocation without the need for constant\\nmanual intervention. We introduce a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based\\nattention mechanism to streamline communication among xApps, reducing overhead\\nand improving overall system efficiency. Our results compare traditional MARL,\\nwhere all xApps communicate, against our MARL GCN-based attention method. The\\nfindings demonstrate the superiority of our approach, especially as the number\\nof xApps increases, ultimately providing a scalable and efficient solution for\\noptimal network slicing management in O-RAN.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:20:11Z\"}"}
