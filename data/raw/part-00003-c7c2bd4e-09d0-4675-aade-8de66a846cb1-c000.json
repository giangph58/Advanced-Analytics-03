{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06609v1\", \"title\": \"InteractRank: Personalized Web-Scale Search Pre-Ranking with Cross\\n  Interaction Features\", \"summary\": \"Modern search systems use a multi-stage architecture to deliver personalized\\nresults efficiently. Key stages include retrieval, pre-ranking, full ranking,\\nand blending, which refine billions of items to top selections. The pre-ranking\\nstage, vital for scoring and filtering hundreds of thousands of items down to a\\nfew thousand, typically relies on two tower models due to their computational\\nefficiency, despite often lacking in capturing complex interactions. While\\nquery-item cross interaction features are paramount for full ranking,\\nintegrating them into pre-ranking models presents efficiency-related\\nchallenges. In this paper, we introduce InteractRank, a novel two tower\\npre-ranking model with robust cross interaction features used at Pinterest. By\\nincorporating historical user engagement-based query-item interactions in the\\nscoring function along with the two tower dot product, InteractRank\\nsignificantly boosts pre-ranking performance with minimal latency and\\ncomputation costs. In real-world A/B experiments at Pinterest, InteractRank\\nimproves the online engagement metric by 6.5% over a BM25 baseline and by 3.7%\\nover a vanilla two tower baseline. We also highlight other components of\\nInteractRank, like real-time user-sequence modeling, and analyze their\\ncontributions through offline ablation studies. The code for InteractRank is\\navailable at https://github.com/pinterest/atg-research/tree/main/InteractRank.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR,cs.AI,cs.LG,H.3.3\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T06:13:58Z\"}"}
