{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04548v1\", \"title\": \"Accelerating Audio Research with Robotic Dummy Heads\", \"summary\": \"This work introduces a robotic dummy head that fuses the acoustic realism of\\nconventional audiological mannequins with the mobility of robots. The proposed\\ndevice is capable of moving, talking, and listening as people do, and can be\\nused to automate spatially-stationary audio experiments, thus accelerating the\\npace of audio research. Critically, the device may also be used as a moving\\nsound source in dynamic experiments, due to its quiet motor. This feature\\ndifferentiates our work from previous robotic acoustic research platforms.\\nValidation that the robot enables high quality audio data collection is\\nprovided through various experiments and acoustic measurements. These\\nexperiments also demonstrate how the robot might be used to study adaptive\\nbinaural beamforming. Design files are provided as open-source to stimulate\\nnovel audio research.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.AS\", \"categories\": \"eess.AS,cs.HC,cs.RO,cs.SD\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T16:30:56Z\"}"}
