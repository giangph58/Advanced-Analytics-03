{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16042v1\", \"title\": \"Approximate matrices of systems of max-min fuzzy relational equations\", \"summary\": \"In this article, we address the inconsistency of a system of max-min fuzzy\\nrelational equations by minimally modifying the matrix governing the system in\\norder to achieve consistency. Our method yields consistent systems that\\napproximate the original inconsistent system in the following sense: the\\nright-hand side vector of each consistent system is that of the inconsistent\\nsystem, and the coefficients of the matrix governing each consistent system are\\nobtained by modifying, exactly and minimally, the entries of the original\\nmatrix that must be corrected to achieve consistency, while leaving all other\\nentries unchanged.\\n  To obtain a consistent system that closely approximates the considered\\ninconsistent system, we study the distance (in terms of a norm among $L_1$,\\n$L_2$ or $L_\\\\infty$) between the matrix of the inconsistent system and the set\\nformed by the matrices of consistent systems that use the same right-hand side\\nvector as the inconsistent system. We show that our method allows us to\\ndirectly compute matrices of consistent systems that use the same right-hand\\nside vector as the inconsistent system whose distance in terms of $L_\\\\infty$\\nnorm to the matrix of the inconsistent system is minimal (the computational\\ncosts are higher when using $L_1$ norm or $L_2$ norm). We also give an explicit\\nanalytical formula for computing this minimal $L_\\\\infty$ distance. Finally, we\\ntranslate our results for systems of min-max fuzzy relational equations and\\npresent some potential applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T17:09:02Z\"}"}
