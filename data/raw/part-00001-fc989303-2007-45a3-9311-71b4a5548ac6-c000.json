It is the\\nconstant-curvature analogue of the exponential family from the\\ninformation-geometric point of view, but the development of computational\\nmethodologies is still in an early stage. In this paper, we propose a fixed\\npoint iteration for maximum likelihood estimation under i.i.d.~sampling, and\\nprove using the duality that the likelihood is monotone along the iterations.\\nWe illustrate the algorithm with the $q$-Gaussian distribution and the\\nDirichlet perturbation.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T14:43:10Z\"}"}
