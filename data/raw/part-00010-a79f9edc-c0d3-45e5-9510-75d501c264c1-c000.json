{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01904v1\", \"title\": \"A Dilaton Sum Rule for the Conformal Anomaly Form Factor in QCD at Order\\n  $\\u03b1_s$\", \"summary\": \"We present an off-shell dispersive analysis of the graviton-gluon-gluon \\\\(\\nTJJ \\\\) vertex, extending previous QED and QCD results of this interaction, and\\nshow that it satisfies a conformal anomaly sum rule at one-loop, under the most\\ngeneral kinematical conditions. The conformal anomaly form factor emerges from\\nthe trace sector of the interaction and its absorptive amplitude is constrained\\nby an area law similarly to the chiral and gravitational anomaly cases.\\nBuilding on our previous analysis of those anomalies, we illustrate the\\npatterns of cancelation between the localized and the continuum contributions\\nto the spectral density of this form factor. As in the chiral/gravitational\\ncase, a spectral flow localizes the exchanged intermediate state at zero\\nmomentum transfer as the quark mass is sent to zero. The perturbative analysis\\nindicates that sum rules are central dynamical features of anomaly\\ninteractions, and the coupling or the decoupling of the associated dilaton\\npoles are correlated with the saturation of the sum rule either by a pole or by\\na dispersive cut. In the conformal and on-shell limit, the particle pole\\ninteraction describes a nonlocal S-matrix element entirely supported on the\\nlight-cone, with contribution both from the dilaton pole in the trace sector\\nand from other sectors of the correlator, except for flavour number $n_f=3$\\nquarks $ u,d,s$, where only the dilaton pole in the trace sector appears.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T17:04:10Z\"}"}
