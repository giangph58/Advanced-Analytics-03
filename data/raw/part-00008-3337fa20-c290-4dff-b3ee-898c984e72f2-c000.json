Despite its advancements, cultural\\nbiases in AI-generated images have raised significant concerns. While much\\nresearch has focused on issues within Western contexts, our study examines the\\nperceived biases regarding the portrayal of East Asian women. In this\\nexploratory study, we invited East Asian users to audit three popular models\\n(DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion) and identified 18 specific perceived\\nbiases, categorized into four patterns: Westernization, overuse or misuse of\\ncultural symbols, sexualization & feminization, and racial stereotypes. This\\nwork highlights the potential challenges posed by AI models in portraying\\nEastern individuals.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T09:20:14Z\"}"}
