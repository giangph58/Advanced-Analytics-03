{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21784v1\", \"title\": \"A Comparison of the Consistent and Independent Second Moment Methods\\n  Applied to Thermal Radiative Transfer\", \"summary\": \"The design of efficient numerical methods for modeling thermal radiative\\ntransfer (TRT) is challenging due to the stiff, nonlinear coupling between\\nradiation and material energies, especially at the time scales of interest in\\nhigh energy density physics and astrophysics. Here, we investigate the use of\\nthe Second Moment Method (SMM) to accelerate absorption-emission within the\\ncontext of the multigroup, Discrete Ordinates transport equations with\\ndiscontinuous Galerkin spatial discretization. SMM employs a\\nreduced-dimensional, diffusion-based model of radiation transport that, when\\ncoupled with suitable discrete closures, serves as a proxy for the transport\\nequation, isolating the transport equation from the stiff absorption-emission\\nphysics. We use a gray low-order system to reduce the cost of solving the\\nlow-order system and leverage SMM low-order discretizations specifically\\ndesigned to be scalably solvable with existing linear solver technology. Our\\nalgorithm robustly resolves the nonlinear TRT system while only relying on\\ntransport sweeps, linearly solving symmetric and positive definite, gray\\ndiffusion systems, and nonlinearly solving the spatially pointwise energy\\nbalance equation. This algorithm is used as a vehicle to compare the efficacy\\nof low-order discretizations developed for steady-state, linear transport on\\ngray and multigroup TRT problems in one and two spatial dimensions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T16:42:29Z\"}"}
