The mixing can contribute significantly to the production\\nof LLPs at proton accelerator experiments, and no consistent description of\\nthese production modes exists in the literature. In this paper, we develop a\\nframework for studying different LLPs - dark photons, vector mediators coupled\\nto the baryon current, and axion-like particles with different coupling\\npatterns. In particular, we implement the production mechanisms in\\n\\\\texttt{PYTHIA8}, study how the overall flux and kinematic distributions depend\\non the LLP's mass, and compare various sub-processes where the mixing\\ncontributes - proton bremsstrahlung, meson decay, and production in the\\nfragmentation chain. We find that our new description of LLP production\\npredicts an integrated flux that differs from current approaches by one to two\\norders of magnitude, and highlight the unavoidable theoretical uncertainties\\ncoming from poor knowledge of the properties of heavy mesons.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T12:37:46Z\"}"}
