{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19764v1\", \"title\": \"BiXiao: An AI-Based Atmospheric Environment Forecasting Model Using\\n  Discontinuous Grids\", \"summary\": \"Currently, the technique of numerical model-based atmospheric environment\\nforecasting has becoming mature, yet traditional numerical prediction methods\\nstruggle to balance computational costs and forecast accuracy, facing\\ndevelopmental bottlenecks. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI)\\noffer new solutions for weather prediction. However, most existing AI models do\\nnot have atmospheric environmental forecasting capabilities, while those with\\nrelated functionalities remain constrained by grid-dependent data requirements,\\nthus unable to deliver operationally feasible city-scale atmospheric\\nenvironment forecasts. Here we introduce 'BiXiao', a novel discontinuous-grid\\nAI model for atmospheric environment forecasting. 'BiXiao' couples\\nmeteorological and environmental sub-models to generate predictions using\\nsite-specific observational data, completing 72-hour forecasts for six major\\npollutants across all key cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region within 30\\nseconds. In the comparative experiments, the 'BiXiao' model outperforms\\nmainstream numerical models in both computational efficiency and forecast\\naccuracy. It surpasses CAMS with respect of operational 72-hour forecasting and\\nexceeds WRF-Chem's performance in heavy pollution case predictions. The\\n'BiXiao' shows potential for nationwide application, providing innovative\\ntechnical support and new perspectives for China's atmospheric environment\\nforecasting operations.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T13:03:39Z\"}"}
