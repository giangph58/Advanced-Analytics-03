This paper investigates the generalizability of VPRF to\\nLarge Language Model (LLM) based dense retrievers. We introduce LLM-VPRF and\\nevaluate its effectiveness across multiple benchmark datasets, analyzing how\\ndifferent LLMs impact the feedback mechanism. Our results demonstrate that\\nVPRF's benefits successfully extend to LLM architectures, establishing it as a\\nrobust technique for enhancing dense retrieval performance regardless of the\\nunderlying models. This work bridges the gap between VPRF with traditional\\nBERT-based dense retrievers and modern LLMs, while providing insights into\\ntheir future directions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:02:01Z\"}"}
