{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16439v1\", \"title\": \"Chebyshev polynomials and Gram determinants from the M\\u00f6bius band\", \"summary\": \"This article explores the connection between Chebyshev polynomials and knot\\ntheory, specifically in relation to Gram determinants. We reveal intriguing\\nformulae involving the Chebyshev polynomial of the first and second kind. In\\nparticular we show that for Mersenne numbers, $M_k=2^k-1$ where $k\\\\geq 2$, the\\n$M_k$-th Chebyshev polynomial of the second kind is the product of Chebyshev\\npolynomials of the first kind. We then discuss the Gram determinant of type\\n$(Mb)_1$, restate the conjecture of its closed formula in terms of mostly\\nproducts of Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind, and prove a factor of the\\ndeterminant that supports the conjecture. We also showcase an algorithm for\\ncalculating the Gram determinant's corresponding matrix. Furthermore, we\\nrestate Qi Chen's conjectured closed formula for the Gram determinant of type\\nMb and discuss future directions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GT\", \"categories\": \"math.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T05:58:19Z\"}"}
