Prior sim-to-real methods\\nfor legged robots mostly rely on the domain randomization approach, where a\\nfixed finite set of simulation parameters is randomized during training.\\nInstead, our method adds state-dependent perturbations to the input joint\\ntorque used for forward simulation during the training phase. These\\nstate-dependent perturbations are designed to simulate a broader range of\\nreality gaps than those captured by randomizing a fixed set of simulation\\nparameters. Experimental results show that our method enables humanoid\\nlocomotion policies that achieve greater robustness against complex reality\\ngaps unseen in the training domain.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T05:25:57Z\"}"}
