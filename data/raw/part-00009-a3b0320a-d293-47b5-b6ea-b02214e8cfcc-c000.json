The result is obtained by\\nmeans of the penalization method, under the assumption that the coefficient is\\nstochastically monotone with respect to the state variable $y$, stochastically\\nLipschitz with respect to the control variables $(z,u)$, and satisfies suitable\\nlinear growth and $p$-integrability conditions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T14:39:38Z\"}"}
