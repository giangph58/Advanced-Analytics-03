{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12652v1\", \"title\": \"AdaptoVision: A Multi-Resolution Image Recognition Model for Robust and\\n  Scalable Classification\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces AdaptoVision, a novel convolutional neural network\\n(CNN) architecture designed to efficiently balance computational complexity and\\nclassification accuracy. By leveraging enhanced residual units, depth-wise\\nseparable convolutions, and hierarchical skip connections, AdaptoVision\\nsignificantly reduces parameter count and computational requirements while\\npreserving competitive performance across various benchmark and medical image\\ndatasets. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that AdaptoVision achieves\\nstate-of-the-art on BreakHis dataset and comparable accuracy levels, notably\\n95.3\\\\% on CIFAR-10 and 85.77\\\\% on CIFAR-100, without relying on any pretrained\\nweights. The model's streamlined architecture and strategic simplifications\\npromote effective feature extraction and robust generalization, making it\\nparticularly suitable for deployment in real-time and resource-constrained\\nenvironments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T05:23:07Z\"}"}
