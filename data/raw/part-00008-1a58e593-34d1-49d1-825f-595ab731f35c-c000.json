{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12123v1\", \"title\": \"The CAM Model: An in vivo Testbed for Molecular Communication Systems\", \"summary\": \"Molecular communication (MC) research increasingly focuses on biomedical\\napplications like health monitoring and drug delivery, demanding testing in\\nrealistic living environments. Elevating MC research requires developing\\nadvanced in vivo testbeds. We introduce the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM)\\nmodel as the first versatile 3D in vivo MC platform. The CAM, a highly\\nvascularized membrane in fertilized chicken eggs, is established in\\nbioengineering, cancer research, and drug development. Its biological realism,\\nreproducibility, and versatility make it ideal for next-generation MC testbeds,\\nbridging proof-of-concept systems and practical applications. We\\ncomprehensively characterize the CAM model's properties and MC system\\nrelevance. Through experimental studies, we investigate fluorescent molecule\\ndistribution in the CAM's closed-loop vascular system. We derive an analytical\\nmodel using the wrapped normal distribution to describe particle propagation in\\ndispersive closed-loop systems dominated by diffusion and flow. Parametric\\nmodels are developed to approximate particle dynamics in the CAM, with\\nparameters estimated via nonlinear least squares curve fitting. A dataset of 69\\nregions from 25 eggs validates our models. We analyze parameter relationships\\nand biological plausibility. Finally, we develop a parametric model for\\nlong-term particle behavior and liver accumulation in chick embryos.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY,eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T14:35:53Z\"}"}
