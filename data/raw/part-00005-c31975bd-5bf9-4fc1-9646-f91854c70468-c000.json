However, other two fundamental subspaces of $R(s)$ in\\ncontrast have received much less attention: the column and row spaces, which\\nalso have their associated minimal indices. This work solves the problems of\\nfinding necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of rational\\nmatrices in two scenarios: (a) when the invariant rational functions and the\\nminimal indices of the column and row spaces are prescribed, and (b) when the\\ncomplete eigenstructure together with the minimal indices of the column and row\\nspaces are prescribed. The particular, but extremely important, cases of these\\nproblems for polynomial matrices are solved first and are the main tool for\\nsolving the general problems. The results in this work complete and\\nnon-trivially extend the necessary and sufficient conditions recently obtained\\nfor the existence of polynomial and rational matrices when only the complete\\neigenstructure is prescribed.\", \"main_category\": \"math.SP\", \"categories\": \"math.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T17:57:53Z\"}"}
