The\\ncalculated energy of {\\\\alpha}-particle lies within 300 keV of the experimental\\ndata. This is the first application of the PNC method to the region of\\nneutron-deficient nuclei. This work provides the first attempt to combine the\\nmicroscopic PNC theory with empirical formulas to study the nuclear {\\\\alpha}\\ndecay. The configurations of ground states are assigned as\\n{\\\\pi}5/2-[523]{\\\\otimes}{\\\\nu}5/2+[633] for 224Np,\\n{\\\\pi}1/2-[530]{\\\\otimes}{\\\\nu}3/2+[642] for 220Pa,\\n{\\\\pi}3/2+[651]{\\\\otimes}{\\\\nu}1/2-[501] for 216Ac, and\\n{\\\\pi}7/2-[514]{\\\\otimes}{\\\\nu}3/2-[501] for 212Fr. The absence of the Z = 92\\nsubshell closure in 224Np is explained by analyzing the proton single-particle\\nlevels. Low-lying excited statesare predicted for nuclei along the\\n{\\\\alpha}-decay chain by the PNC method. Based on the PNC predicted\\n{\\\\alpha}-decay energy and the assigned configurations, the {\\\\alpha}-decay\\nhalf-lives are calculated by the empirical formulas, in which the angular\\nmomentum taken away by the {\\\\alpha} particle is taken into account. The angular\\nmomentum have an important effect on the {\\\\alpha}-decay half-life. The errors\\nof the empirical formulas calculation are in two orders of magnitude with the\\nexperimental data.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T03:41:19Z\"}"}
