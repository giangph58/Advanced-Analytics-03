This paper introduces a self-aligning\\nresonant beam system for simultaneous light information and power transfer\\n(SLIPT), employing a novel coupled spatially distributed resonator (CSDR). The\\nsystem utilizes a resonant beam for efficient power delivery and a\\nsecond-harmonic beam for concurrent data transmission, inherently minimizing\\necho interference and enabling bidirectional communication. Through\\ncomprehensive analyses, we investigate the CSDR's stable region, beam\\nevolution, and power characteristics in relation to working distance and device\\nparameters. Numerical simulations validate the CSDR-SLIPT system's feasibility\\nby identifying a stable beam waist location for achieving accurate mode-match\\ncoupling between two spatially distributed resonant cavities and demonstrating\\nits operational range and efficient power delivery across varying distances.\\nThe research reveals the system's benefits in terms of both safety and energy\\ntransmission efficiency. We also demonstrate the trade-off among the\\nreflectivities of the cavity mirrors in the CSDR. These findings offer valuable\\ndesign insights for resonant beam systems, advancing SLIPT with significant\\npotential for remote device connectivity.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T10:11:36Z\"}"}
