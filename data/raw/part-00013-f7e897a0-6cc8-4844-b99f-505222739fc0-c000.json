Although studied in various systems both in theory and experiment,\\nthe redirection of single photons with many output ports, compatible with\\nlarge-scale photonic circuits, still needs to be explored. Here, we demonstrate\\na direction switchable single-photon emitter using a Rydberg polariton. The\\nRydberg component of the stored photon is changed using a stimulated Raman\\ntransition with a specific intermediate state. By adjusting the direction of\\nthe retrieval laser, we can redirect the emitted photon into a rich variety of\\nalternative modes. Building upon this scheme, we propose a quantum routing of\\nsingle photons with \\\\textit{N} output channels and unity routing efficiency. In\\naddition, the protocol reduces the effect of motional dephasing increasing the\\nphoton lifetime to $>10~\\\\mu$s ($>20$ times photon processing time), enabling\\nfunctional quantum devices based on Rydberg polaritons.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T11:35:36Z\"}"}
