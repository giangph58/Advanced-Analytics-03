{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04131v1\", \"title\": \"The detour covering number and cummerbund covering number of a graph\", \"summary\": \"We introduce several new concepts about graphs and investigate their basic\\nproperties. A longest path in a graph is called a detour and a longest cycle is\\ncalled a cummerbund. The detour covering number of a graph is the number of\\nvertices that lie in a detour. A graph is said to be detour covered if every\\nvertex lies in a detour. The cummerbund covering number and cummerbund covered\\ngraphs are defined similarly. Some of the main results are as follows. (1)\\nMinimum degree and forbidden subgraph conditions that ensure a graph to be\\ncummerbund covered or detour covered. (2) The minimum cummerbund covering\\nnumber and minimum detour covering number of a graph with connectivity or girth\\nconditions. (3) The minimum cummerbund covering number of a $2$-connected\\nbipartite graph and the extremal graphs.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T05:03:15Z\"}"}
