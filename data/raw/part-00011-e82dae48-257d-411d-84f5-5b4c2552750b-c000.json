However,\\nthe network operator must adhere to the voltage unbalance levels within the\\nlimits specified by IEEE, IEC, and NEMA standards for the safety of the\\nequipment as well as the efficiency of the network operation. Existing works\\nhave proposed active and reactive power control in the network to minimize\\nimbalances. However, these optimization problems are highly nonlinear and\\nnonconvex due to the inherent non-linearity of unbalanced metrics and\\npower-flow equations. In this work, we propose a linearization approach of\\nunbalance metrics such as voltage unbalance factors (VUF), phase voltage\\nunbalance rate (PVUR), and line voltage unbalance rate (LVUR) using the first\\norder Taylor's approximation. This linearization is then applied to the phase\\nbalancing control scheme; it is formulated as a feedback approach where the\\nlinearization is updated successively after the active/reactive control\\nsetpoint has been actuated and shows improvement in voltage imbalances. We\\ndemonstrate the application of the proposed scheme on a standard IEEE benchmark\\ntest case, demonstrating its effectiveness.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T13:40:31Z\"}"}
