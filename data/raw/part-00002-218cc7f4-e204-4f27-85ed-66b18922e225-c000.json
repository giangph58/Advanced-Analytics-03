The method relies on using\\nthe exact solutions at select parameter values to construct a low-dimensional\\nbasis, from which observables can be efficiently and reliably computed\\nthroughout the parameter space. Here we show that this method can be\\ngeneralized to driven-dissipative Markovian systems allowing efficient\\ncalculations of observables in the transient and steady states. A subsequent\\ndistillation of the reduced basis vectors according to their explained\\nvariances allows for an unbiased exploration of the most pronounced parameter\\ndependencies indicative of phase boundaries in the thermodynamic limit.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T17:53:23Z\"}"}
