The discrepancy is\\nattributed to sample specificity but has not been systemically addressed. Here\\nwe report a single-parameter driven three-stage evolution of quantum\\ncriticality unveiled in superconductor-insulator transition in underdoped\\nBi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\\\\delta} flakes. The evolution starts with a single quantum\\ncritical point emerging at the boundary between the superconducting and\\nantiferromagnetic phases, then evolving into anomalous quantum Griffiths\\nsingularity at the medium doping levels and eventually being replaced by\\nquantum Griffiths singularity in the deep superconducting regime. A puddle\\nmodel that incorporates the developments of antiferromagnetic correlation can\\ncapture the evolution. The results offer a new aspect to examine previous\\nseemingly sample-specific quantum critical behavior and lay the foundation for\\nfurther exploring complex quantum criticality in strongly correlated systems;\\nmeanwhile they shed light on the detailed interaction between superconductivity\\nand antiferromagnetism in cuprates.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T07:27:53Z\"}"}
