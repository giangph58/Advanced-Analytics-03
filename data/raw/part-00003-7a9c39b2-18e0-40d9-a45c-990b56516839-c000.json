Uniform compositions\\n$[(\\\\mathrm{CoO}_2/\\\\mathrm{K})_6$ or $(\\\\mathrm{NiO}_2/\\\\mathrm{K})_6]$ show\\nlimited activity, while homogenously-mixed-metal cobalt/nickel oxides\\n$[(\\\\mathrm{Co}_n\\\\mathrm{Ni}_{1-n}\\\\mathrm{O}_2/\\\\mathrm{K})_6]$ display moderate\\nimprovement. However, a layer-by-layer arrangement of cobalt and nickel oxide\\nsheets [e.g., $(\\\\mathrm{CoO}_2/\\\\mathrm{K}/\\\\mathrm{NiO}_2/\\\\mathrm{K})$] provides\\nsuperior catalytic performance, reducing the oxygen evolution overpotential by\\nmore than 400 mV. Density functional theory simulations provide an illustration\\nof the electronic properties (density of states and localization of orbitals)\\nthat promote catalysis in the layer-segregated materials over those of\\nhomogeneous composition. This study reveals that atomic preorganization of\\nmetal ions within layered catalysts plays a more crucial role than overall\\nmetal composition in enhancing catalytic efficiency for oxygen evolution.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T16:01:49Z\"}"}
