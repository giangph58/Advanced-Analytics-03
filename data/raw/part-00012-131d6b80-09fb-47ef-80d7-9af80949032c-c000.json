{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20594v1\", \"title\": \"Mordell--Lang and disparate Selmer ranks of odd twists of some\\n  superelliptic curves over global function fields\", \"summary\": \"Fix a prime number $\\\\ell \\\\geq 5$. Let $K = \\\\mathbb{F}_q(t)$ be a global\\nfunction field of characteristic $p$ coprime to $2,3$, and $q \\\\equiv 1 \\\\text{\\nmod } \\\\ell$. Let $C:y^\\\\ell = F(x)$ be a non-isotrivial superelliptic curve over\\n$K$ such that $F$ is a degree $3$ polynomial over $\\\\mathbb{F}_q(t)$. Denote by\\n$C_f: fy^\\\\ell = F(x)$ the twist of $C$ by a polynomial $f$ over $\\\\mathbb{F}_q$.\\nAssuming some conditions on $C$, we show that the expected number of\\n$K$-rational points of $C_f$ is bounded, and at least $99\\\\%$ of such curves\\n$C_f$ have at most $(3p)^{5\\\\ell} \\\\cdot \\\\ell!$ many $K$-rational points, as $f$\\nranges over the set of polynomials of sufficiently large degree over\\n$\\\\mathbb{F}_q$. To achieve this, we compute the distribution of dimensions of\\n$1-\\\\zeta_\\\\ell$ Selmer groups of Jacobians of such superelliptic curves. This is\\ndone by generalizing the technique of constructing a governing Markov operator,\\nas developed from previous studies by Klagsbrun--Mazur--Rubin, Yu, and the\\nauthor. As a byproduct, we prove that the density of odd twist families of such\\nsuperelliptic curves with even Selmer ranks cannot be equal to $50\\\\%$, a\\ndisparity phenomena observed in previous works by Klagsbrun--Mazur--Rubin, Yu,\\nand Morgan for quadratic twist families of principally polarized abelian\\nvarieties.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T09:47:43Z\"}"}
