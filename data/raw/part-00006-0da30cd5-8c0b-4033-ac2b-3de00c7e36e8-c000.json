{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21342v1\", \"title\": \"Low latency FPGA implementation of twisted Edward curve cryptography\\n  hardware accelerator over prime field\", \"summary\": \"The performance of any elliptic curve cryptography hardware accelerator\\nsignificantly relies on the efficiency of the underlying point multiplication\\n(PM) architecture. This article presents a hardware implementation of\\nfield-programmable gate array (FPGA) based modular arithmetic, group operation,\\nand point multiplication unit on the twisted Edwards curve (Edwards25519) over\\nthe 256-bit prime field. An original hardware architecture of a unified point\\noperation module in projective coordinates that executes point addition and\\npoint doubling within a single module has been developed, taking only 646 clock\\ncycles and ensuring a better security level than conventional approaches. The\\nproposed point multiplication module consumes 1.4 ms time, operating at a\\nmaximal clock frequency of 117.8 MHz utilising 164,730 clock cycles having\\n183.38 kbps throughput on the Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA platform for 256-bit length\\nof key. The comparative assessment of latency and throughput across various\\nrelated recent works indicates the effectiveness of our proposed PM\\narchitecture. Finally, this high throughput and low latency PM architecture\\nwill be a good candidate for rapid data encryption in high-speed wireless\\ncommunication networks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T06:03:36Z\"}"}
