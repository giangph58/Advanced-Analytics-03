An\\nexpression for neutron-star radii as a function of gravitational-wave only data\\nwould be advantageous for the multi-messenger astronomy. Using pySR, a symbolic\\nregression method trained on TOV solutions to piecewise polytropic EOS input,\\nan approximate symbolic expression for neutron-star radius as a function of\\nmass and tidal deformability is obtained. The approximation is tested on\\npiecewise polytropic EOS NS data, as well as on NS sequences based on various\\nnon-polytropic EOSs based on realistic theories of dense matter, achieving\\nconsistent agreement between the ground truth values and the approximation for\\na broad range of NS parameters covering current astrophysical observations,\\nwith average radii differences of few hundred meters. Additionally, the\\napproximation is applied to GW170817 gravitational-wave mass and tidal\\ndeformability posteriors, and compared to reported inferred radius\\ndistributions.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:33:55Z\"}"}
