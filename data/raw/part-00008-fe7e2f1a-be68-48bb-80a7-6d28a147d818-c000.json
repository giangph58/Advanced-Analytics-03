{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10122v1\", \"title\": \"Design Optimization of Flip FET Standard Cells with Dual-sided Pins for\\n  Ultimate Scaling\", \"summary\": \"Recently, we proposed a novel transistor architecture for 3D stacked FETs\\ncalled Flip FET (FFET), featuring N/P transistors back-to-back stacked and\\ndual-sided interconnects. With dual-sided power rails and signal tracks, FFET\\ncan achieve an aggressive 2.5T cell height. As a tradeoff, the complex\\nstructure and limited numbers of M0 tracks could limit the standard cell\\ndesign. As a solution, multiple innovations were introduced and examined in\\nthis work. Based on an advanced node design rule, several unique building\\nblocks in FFET such as drain merge (DM), gate merge (GM), field drain merge\\n(FDM) and buried signal track (BST) were investigated. Other key design\\nconcepts of multi-row, split gate and dummy gate insertion (DG) were also\\ncarefully studied, delivering around 35.6% area reduction compared with 3T\\nCFET. Furthermore, the symmetric design of FFET has unique superiority over\\nCFET thanks to the separate N/P logic on two sides of the wafer and their\\nconnections using DM and GM. New routing scheme with dual-sided output pins on\\nboth wafer frontside (FS) and backside (BS) was proposed for the first time.\\nFinally, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation on complex cell design, taking\\nAOI22 as an example. New strategies were proposed and examined. The FDM design\\nis identified as the best, outperforming the BST and dummy gate design by 1.93%\\nand 5.13% for the transition delay.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T11:31:44Z\"}"}
