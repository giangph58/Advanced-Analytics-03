Recently Fox's conjecture was settled for all\\nspecial alternating links. In this paper we take a broad view of the Alexander\\npolynomials of special alternating links, showing that they are a generating\\nfunction for a statistic on certain vector configurations. We study three types\\nof vector configurations: (1) vectors arising from cographic matroids, (2)\\nvectors arising from graphic matroids, (3) vectors arising from totally\\npositive matrices. We prove that Alexander polynomials of special alternating\\nlinks belong to both classes (1) and (2), and prove log-concavity, respectively\\ntrapezoidal, properties for classes (2) and (3). As a special case of our\\nresults, we obtain a new proof of Fox's conjecture for special alternating\\nlinks.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,math.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:37:31Z\"}"}
