However, the system dynamics is typically\\ndescribed by a radiation pressure force treatment in which the frequency shift\\nis expanded stopping at first order in the membrane displacements. In this\\npaper, we study the full dynamics of the system obtained by considering the\\nexact nonlinear dependence of the optomechanical interaction between two\\nmembranes' vibrational modes and the driven cavity mode. We then compare this\\ndynamics with the standard treatment based on the Hamiltonian linear\\ninteraction, and we find the conditions under which the two dynamics may\\nsignificantly depart from each other. In particular, we see that a parameter\\nregime exists in which the customary first-order treatment provides distinct\\nand incorrect predictions for the synchronization of two self-sustained\\nmechanical limit-cycles, and for Gaussian entanglement of the two membranes in\\nthe case of two-tone driving.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T16:15:04Z\"}"}
