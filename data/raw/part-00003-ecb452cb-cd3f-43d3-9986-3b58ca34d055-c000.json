A\\nlightweight, stream-based tunnel is constructed using the Rust-based Quinn\\nlibrary, enabling TCP traffic to traverse QUIC connections transparently.\\nPerformance is evaluated under varying network conditions, including packet\\nloss, high latency, and out-of-order delivery. Results indicate that TCP over\\nQUIC maintains significantly higher throughput than native TCP in lossy or\\nunstable environments, with up to a high improvement under 20\\\\% packet loss.\\nHowever, under ideal network conditions, tunneling introduces modest overhead\\ndue to encryption and user-space processing. These findings provide insights\\ninto the trade-offs of TCP over QUIC tunneling and its suitability for\\ndeployment in dynamic or impaired networks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:57:35Z\"}"}
