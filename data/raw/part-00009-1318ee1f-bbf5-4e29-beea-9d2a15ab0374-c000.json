{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21778v1\", \"title\": \"LoC-LIC: Low Complexity Learned Image Coding Using Hierarchical Feature\\n  Transforms\", \"summary\": \"Current learned image compression models typically exhibit high complexity,\\nwhich demands significant computational resources. To overcome these\\nchallenges, we propose an innovative approach that employs hierarchical feature\\nextraction transforms to significantly reduce complexity while preserving bit\\nrate reduction efficiency. Our novel architecture achieves this by using fewer\\nchannels for high spatial resolution inputs/feature maps. On the other hand,\\nfeature maps with a large number of channels have reduced spatial dimensions,\\nthereby cutting down on computational load without sacrificing performance.\\nThis strategy effectively reduces the forward pass complexity from \\\\(1256 \\\\,\\n\\\\text{kMAC/Pixel}\\\\) to just \\\\(270 \\\\, \\\\text{kMAC/Pixel}\\\\). As a result, the\\nreduced complexity model can open the way for learned image compression models\\nto operate efficiently across various devices and pave the way for the\\ndevelopment of new architectures in image compression technology.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T16:30:06Z\"}"}
