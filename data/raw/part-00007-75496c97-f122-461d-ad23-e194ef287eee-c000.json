The DM density profile is\\nconstrained by Hubble Space Telescope data, stellar dynamics, and globular\\ncluster (GC) measurements of the elliptical galaxy NGC 4649 (M60). Using this\\nprofile, we construct two distinct spacetime solutions characterized by the\\nblack hole mass ($M$), critical velocity ($V_c$), and core radius ($a$), all\\nreducing to the Schwarzschild case in the limit $V_c=0$ and $a=0$. Our results\\nshow that the DM halo modifies essential BH features, such as the event horizon\\nradius and spacetime curvature, as reflected in the Kretschmann scalar. We also\\nderive an approximate analytical expression for the BH shadow radius, which\\nincreases slightly due to the halo's influence. Comparisons with two\\nobservational datasets further validate the analysis. Thermodynamic properties\\nare examined across the two models. In the first, a generalized Smarr formula\\nis obtained via two additional variables, $\\\\gamma$ and $a$. The second\\nincorporates halo effects through $V_c=0$ and $a=0$. These results underscore\\nthe role of DM in shaping both geometric and thermodynamic aspects of BHs.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.HE,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T16:05:12Z\"}"}
