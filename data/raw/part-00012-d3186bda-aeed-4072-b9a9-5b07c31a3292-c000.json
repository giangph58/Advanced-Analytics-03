{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12952v1\", \"title\": \"Safe Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Dynamics and Control\", \"summary\": \"This tutorial paper focuses on safe physics-informed machine learning in the\\ncontext of dynamics and control, providing a comprehensive overview of how to\\nintegrate physical models and safety guarantees. As machine learning techniques\\nenhance the modeling and control of complex dynamical systems, ensuring safety\\nand stability remains a critical challenge, especially in safety-critical\\napplications like autonomous vehicles, robotics, medical decision-making, and\\nenergy systems. We explore various approaches for embedding and ensuring safety\\nconstraints, such as structural priors, Lyapunov functions, Control Barrier\\nFunctions, predictive control, projections, and robust optimization techniques,\\nensuring that the learned models respect stability and safety criteria.\\nAdditionally, we delve into methods for uncertainty quantification and safety\\nverification, including reachability analysis and neural network verification\\ntools, which help validate that control policies remain within safe operating\\nbounds even in uncertain environments. The paper includes illustrative examples\\ndemonstrating the implementation aspects of safe learning frameworks that\\ncombine the strengths of data-driven approaches with the rigor of physical\\nprinciples, offering a path toward the safe control of complex dynamical\\nsystems.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T13:52:55Z\"}"}
