{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20926v1\", \"title\": \"Bipartite Randomized Response Mechanism for Local Differential Privacy\", \"summary\": \"With the increasing importance of data privacy, Local Differential Privacy\\n(LDP) has recently become a strong measure of privacy for protecting each\\nuser's privacy from data analysts without relying on a trusted third party. In\\nmany cases, both data providers and data analysts hope to maximize the utility\\nof released data. In this paper, we study the fundamental trade-off formulated\\nas a constrained optimization problem: maximizing data utility subject to the\\nconstraint of LDP budgets. In particular, the Generalized Randomized Response\\n(GRR) treats all discrete data equally except for the true data. For this, we\\nintroduce an adaptive LDP mechanism called Bipartite Randomized Response (BRR),\\nwhich solves the above privacy-utility maximization problem from the global\\nstandpoint. We prove that for any utility function and any privacy level,\\nsolving the maximization problem is equivalent to confirming how many\\nhigh-utility data to be treated equally as the true data on release\\nprobability, the outcome of which gives the optimal randomized response.\\nFurther, solving this linear program can be computationally cheap in theory.\\nSeveral examples of utility functions defined by distance metrics and\\napplications in decision trees and deep learning are presented. The results of\\nvarious experiments show that our BRR significantly outperforms the\\nstate-of-the-art LDP mechanisms of both continuous and distributed types.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T16:39:50Z\"}"}
