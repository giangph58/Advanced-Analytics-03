Many works have focused on the\\nmergers of sBH in the disk that produce gravitational waves; however, sBHs in\\nhyperbolic orbits also emit gravitational-wave \\\\bremss{} that can be detected\\nby ground-based interferometers like LIGO. In this work, we analyze the\\nscattering of sBHs in an AGN disk as they migrate inside the disk, focusing on\\ngravitational-wave \\\\bremss{} emission. We determine how the gravitational-wave\\nemission depends on the different parameters of the scattering experiments,\\nsuch as the mass of the supermassive black hole and the sBH migration rate and\\nmass ratio. We find that scattering with detectable gravitational-wave\\n\\\\bremss{} is more frequent around lower mass SMBHs ($\\\\sim 10^{5-6}$M$_\\\\odot$).\\nWe then conduct a suite of Monte Carlo simulations and estimated the rate for\\nground-based gravitational-wave detections to be in the range of 0.08 - 1194\\n$\\\\text{Gpc}^{-3} \\\\text{ yr}^{-1}$, depending on migration forces and detection\\nthresholds, with large uncertainties accounting for variations in possible AGN\\nenvironments. The expected rate for our {\\\\tt Fiducial} parameters is 3.2\\n$\\\\text{Gpc}^{-3} \\\\text{ yr}^{-1}$. Finally, we provide first-principle\\ngravitational wave templates produced by the encounters.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T06:54:11Z\"}"}
