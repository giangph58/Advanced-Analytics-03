However, many educational programs struggle\\nto provide realistic practice scenarios. To address this problem, we propose\\nTheraQuest, a gamified, web-based simulation platform that employs large\\nlanguage models (LLMs) to generate diverse virtual patients with varying\\nsymptoms and cultural backgrounds. Through interactive dialogue, anatomical\\ndecision-making, and immediate assessment, trainees develop both diagnostic\\nreasoning and empathetic communication skills in a low-risk environment. Unlike\\nexclusively VR-based solutions, TheraQuest remains accessible via standard web\\nbrowsers, mitigating the cost and discomfort associated with extended headset\\nuse. Preliminary testing suggests that integrating LLM-driven virtual patients\\nwith real-time skill metrics can enhance trainee engagement and help bridge the\\ngap between theoretical knowledge and clinical proficiency.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GT\", \"categories\": \"cs.GT,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T15:31:52Z\"}"}
