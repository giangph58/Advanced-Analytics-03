{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16487v1\", \"title\": \"Rethinking Generalizable Infrared Small Target Detection: A Real-scene\\n  Benchmark and Cross-view Representation Learning\", \"summary\": \"Infrared small target detection (ISTD) is highly sensitive to sensor type,\\nobservation conditions, and the intrinsic properties of the target. These\\nfactors can introduce substantial variations in the distribution of acquired\\ninfrared image data, a phenomenon known as domain shift. Such distribution\\ndiscrepancies significantly hinder the generalization capability of ISTD models\\nacross diverse scenarios. To tackle this challenge, this paper introduces an\\nISTD framework enhanced by domain adaptation. To alleviate distribution shift\\nbetween datasets and achieve cross-sample alignment, we introduce Cross-view\\nChannel Alignment (CCA). Additionally, we propose the Cross-view Top-K Fusion\\nstrategy, which integrates target information with diverse background features,\\nenhancing the model' s ability to extract critical data characteristics. To\\nfurther mitigate the impact of noise on ISTD, we develop a Noise-guided\\nRepresentation learning strategy. This approach enables the model to learn more\\nnoise-resistant feature representations, to improve its generalization\\ncapability across diverse noisy domains. Finally, we develop a dedicated\\ninfrared small target dataset, RealScene-ISTD. Compared to state-of-the-art\\nmethods, our approach demonstrates superior performance in terms of detection\\nprobability (Pd), false alarm rate (Fa), and intersection over union (IoU).
