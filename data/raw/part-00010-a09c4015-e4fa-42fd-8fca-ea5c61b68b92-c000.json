{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03188v1\", \"title\": \"Transformers Applied to Short-term Solar PV Power Output Forecasting\", \"summary\": \"Reliable forecasts of the power output from variable renewable energy\\ngenerators like solar photovoltaic systems are important to balancing load on\\nreal-time electricity markets and ensuring electricity supply reliability.\\nHowever, solar PV power output is highly uncertain, with significant variations\\noccurring over both longer (daily or seasonally) and shorter (within minutes)\\ntimescales due to weather conditions, especially cloud cover. This paper builds\\non existing work that uses convolutional neural networks in the computer vision\\ntask of predicting (in a Nowcast model) and forecasting (in a Forecast model)\\nsolar PV power output (Stanford EAO SUNSET Model). A pure transformer\\narchitecture followed by a fully-connected layer is applied to one year of\\nimage data with experiments run on various combinations of learning rate and\\nbatch size. We find that the transformer architecture performs almost as well\\nas the baseline model in the PV output prediction task. However, it performs\\nworse on sunny days.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CE\", \"categories\": \"cs.CE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T05:14:17Z\"}"}
