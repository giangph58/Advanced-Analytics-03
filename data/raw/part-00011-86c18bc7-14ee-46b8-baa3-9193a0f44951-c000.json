{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00359v1\", \"title\": \"TNStream: Applying Tightest Neighbors to Micro-Clusters to Define\\n  Multi-Density Clusters in Streaming Data\", \"summary\": \"In data stream clustering, systematic theory of stream clustering algorithms\\nremains relatively scarce. Recently, density-based methods have gained\\nattention. However, existing algorithms struggle to simultaneously handle\\narbitrarily shaped, multi-density, high-dimensional data while maintaining\\nstrong outlier resistance. Clustering quality significantly deteriorates when\\ndata density varies complexly. This paper proposes a clustering algorithm based\\non the novel concept of Tightest Neighbors and introduces a data stream\\nclustering theory based on the Skeleton Set. Based on these theories, this\\npaper develops a new method, TNStream, a fully online algorithm. The algorithm\\nadaptively determines the clustering radius based on local similarity,\\nsummarizing the evolution of multi-density data streams in micro-clusters. It\\nthen applies a Tightest Neighbors-based clustering algorithm to form final\\nclusters. To improve efficiency in high-dimensional cases, Locality-Sensitive\\nHashing (LSH) is employed to structure micro-clusters, addressing the challenge\\nof storing k-nearest neighbors. TNStream is evaluated on various synthetic and\\nreal-world datasets using different clustering metrics. Experimental results\\ndemonstrate its effectiveness in improving clustering quality for multi-density\\ndata and validate the proposed data stream clustering theory.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.NE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T07:15:20Z\"}"}
