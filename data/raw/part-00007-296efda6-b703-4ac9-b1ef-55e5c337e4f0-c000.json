{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05378v1\", \"title\": \"Chirp-Based Aliasing Analysis of Arrays in the Spherical Wavefront\\n  Regime\", \"summary\": \"In antenna arrays, wave propagation modeling based on Euclidean principles is\\ntypically represented by steering vectors or signals. This paper provides a\\nnew, chirp-based, interpretation of steering vectors in the Spherical Wavefront\\nRegime (SWR), establishing a relationship between the spatial spectrum of the\\nreceived (resp. transmitted) signal and the geometry of the array and the\\nsource (resp. target). Leveraging the well-known sampling theorem, we analyze\\naliasing effects arising from spatial sampling with a finite number of antennas\\nand understand how these effects degrade the Ambiguity Function (AF). Our\\nframework provides geometric insight into these degradations, offering a deeper\\nunderstanding of the non-space-invariant aliasing mechanisms in the SWR. The\\nproposed approach is formulated for general antenna arrays and then\\ninstantiated to Circular Array and to Uniform Linear Array structures operating\\nin Near Field conditions.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T16:12:18Z\"}"}
