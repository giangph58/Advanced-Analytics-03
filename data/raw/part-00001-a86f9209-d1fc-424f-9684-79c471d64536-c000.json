{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11075v1\", \"title\": \"Emergence of Goal-Directed Behaviors via Active Inference with\\n  Self-Prior\", \"summary\": \"Infants often exhibit goal-directed behaviors, such as reaching for a sensory\\nstimulus, even when no external reward criterion is provided. These\\nintrinsically motivated behaviors facilitate spontaneous exploration and\\nlearning of the body and environment during early developmental stages.\\nAlthough computational modeling can offer insight into the mechanisms\\nunderlying such behaviors, many existing studies on intrinsic motivation focus\\nprimarily on how exploration contributes to acquiring external rewards. In this\\npaper, we propose a novel density model for an agent's own multimodal sensory\\nexperiences, called the \\\"self-prior,\\\" and investigate whether it can\\nautonomously induce goal-directed behavior. Integrated within an active\\ninference framework based on the free energy principle, the self-prior\\ngenerates behavioral references purely from an intrinsic process that minimizes\\nmismatches between average past sensory experiences and current observations.\\nThis mechanism is also analogous to the acquisition and utilization of a body\\nschema through continuous interaction with the environment. We examine this\\napproach in a simulated environment and confirm that the agent spontaneously\\nreaches toward a tactile stimulus. Our study implements intrinsically motivated\\nbehavior shaped by the agent's own sensory experiences, demonstrating the\\nspontaneous emergence of intentional behavior during early development.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T11:16:27Z\"}"}
