{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16406v1\", \"title\": \"Long Exposure Localization in Darkness Using Consumer Cameras\", \"summary\": \"In this paper we evaluate performance of the SeqSLAM algorithm for passive\\nvision-based localization in very dark environments with low-cost cameras that\\nresult in massively blurred images. We evaluate the effect of motion blur from\\nexposure times up to 10,000 ms from a moving car, and the performance of\\nlocalization in day time from routes learned at night in two different\\nenvironments. Finally we perform a statistical analysis that compares the\\nbaseline performance of matching unprocessed grayscale images to using patch\\nnormalization and local neighborhood normalization - the two key SeqSLAM\\ncomponents. Our results and analysis show for the first time why the SeqSLAM\\nalgorithm is effective, and demonstrate the potential for cheap camera-based\\nlocalization systems that function despite extreme appearance change.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T04:18:57Z\"}"}
