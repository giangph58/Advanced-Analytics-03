We discuss\\nhow time value of money is handled, and how salvage value and milestone-year\\nweighting can address mismatches between asset lifetimes and model horizons.\\nThese methods are implemented in the open-source TulipaEnergyModel to support\\ntransparent and tractable long-term energy system planning.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:52:34Z\"}"}
