This can be expressed in the form of a (hybrid) stochastic differential\\nequation, for which the existence of its solution is also discussed. All\\nidentities are given in terms of new generalisations of scale functions\\n(counterparts of the scale functions from the theory of L\\\\'evy processes). To\\nillustrate the applicability of our results, the probability of ruin is\\nobtained for a risk process with delays in the dividend payments.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T11:02:11Z\"}"}
