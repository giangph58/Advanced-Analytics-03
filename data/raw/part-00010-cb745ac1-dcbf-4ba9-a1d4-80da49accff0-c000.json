Existing point cloud unsupervised domain\\nadaptation (UDA) methods typically employ a multi-task learning (MTL) framework\\nthat combines primary classification tasks with auxiliary self-supervision\\ntasks to bridge the gap between cross-domain feature distributions. However,\\nour further experiments demonstrate that not all gradients from\\nself-supervision tasks are beneficial and some may negatively impact the\\nclassification performance. In this paper, we propose a novel solution, termed\\nSaliency Map-based Data Sampling Block (SM-DSB), to mitigate these gradient\\nconflicts. Specifically, our method designs a new scoring mechanism based on\\nthe skewness of 3D saliency maps to estimate gradient conflicts without\\nrequiring target labels. Leveraging this, we develop a sample selection\\nstrategy that dynamically filters out samples whose self-supervision gradients\\nare not beneficial for the classification. Our approach is scalable,\\nintroducing modest computational overhead, and can be integrated into all the\\npoint cloud UDA MTL frameworks. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our\\nmethod outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, we provide a new\\nperspective on understanding the UDA problem through back-propagation analysis.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T11:16:19Z\"}"}
