{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03724v1\", \"title\": \"Stay Positive: Neural Refinement of Sample Weights\", \"summary\": \"Monte Carlo simulations are an essential tool for data analysis in particle\\nphysics. Simulated events are typically produced alongside weights that\\nredistribute the cross section across the phase space. Latent degrees of\\nfreedom introduce a distribution of weights at a given point in the phase\\nspace, which can include negative values. Several post-hoc reweighting methods\\nhave been developed to eliminate the negative weights. All of these methods\\nshare the common strategy of approximating the average weight as a function of\\nphase space. We introduce an alternative approach with a potentially simpler\\nlearning task. Instead of reweighting to the average, we refine the initial\\nweights with a scaling transformation, utilizing a phase space-dependent\\nfactor. Since this new refinement method does not need to model the full weight\\ndistribution, it can be more accurate. High-dimensional and unbinned phase\\nspace is processed using neural networks for the refinement. Using both\\nrealistic and synthetic examples, we show that the new neural refinement method\\nis able to match or exceed the accuracy of similar weight transformations.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex,physics.data-an\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T17:52:30Z\"}"}
