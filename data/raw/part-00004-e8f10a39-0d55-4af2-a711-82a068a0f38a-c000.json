{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19595v1\", \"title\": \"WILD: a new in-the-Wild Image Linkage Dataset for synthetic image\\n  attribution\", \"summary\": \"Synthetic image source attribution is an open challenge, with an increasing\\nnumber of image generators being released yearly. The complexity and the sheer\\nnumber of available generative techniques, as well as the scarcity of\\nhigh-quality open source datasets of diverse nature for this task, make\\ntraining and benchmarking synthetic image source attribution models very\\nchallenging. WILD is a new in-the-Wild Image Linkage Dataset designed to\\nprovide a powerful training and benchmarking tool for synthetic image\\nattribution models. The dataset is built out of a closed set of 10 popular\\ncommercial generators, which constitutes the training base of attribution\\nmodels, and an open set of 10 additional generators, simulating a real-world\\nin-the-wild scenario. Each generator is represented by 1,000 images, for a\\ntotal of 10,000 images in the closed set and 10,000 images in the open set.\\nHalf of the images are post-processed with a wide range of operators. WILD\\nallows benchmarking attribution models in a wide range of tasks, including\\nclosed and open set identification and verification, and robust attribution\\nwith respect to post-processing and adversarial attacks. Models trained on WILD\\nare expected to benefit from the challenging scenario represented by the\\ndataset itself. Moreover, an assessment of seven baseline methodologies on\\nclosed and open set attribution is presented, including robustness tests with\\nrespect to post-processing.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MM\", \"categories\": \"cs.MM,cs.AI,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T08:58:34Z\"}"}
