An exact solution to\\nbe considered as a basic one for the dark holes is presented. This solution\\nmay, in principle, be used for a qualitative description of the effect of\\nasymptotically flat rotation curves in galaxies. To convert the basic solution\\ninto a more realistic one suitable for astrophysical applications, a family of\\nmodified solutions is considered. These solutions are studied numerically for\\nrepresentative set of free parameters.\\n  These results were reported in the talk [2] but not included into the\\nproceedings [3] due to article length limitations. The note can be considered\\nas a supplement to this reference.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:37:51Z\"}"}
