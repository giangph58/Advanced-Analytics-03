Generically, one encounters\\ncorrelation functions of multiple currents which must satisfy Ward identities.\\nAt intermediate steps, however the Ward identities are obscured, and often\\nviolated by physically motivated approximation schemes. In this paper we\\noutline a method to construct a representation of the aforementioned\\ncorrelators that manifests gauge invariance in the limit of a heavy target\\n(i.e., when recoil energy can be neglected). This representation then enables\\nmanifestly gauge invariant approximation schemes. Furthermore, the proposed\\nrepresentation naturally separates the largest contributions that dominate\\nscattering amplitudes in the limit of a heavy constituent (e.g., proton) mass.\\nWe analyze elastic electron scattering from nuclei in detail, and also discuss\\nradiative corrections to processes mediated by the weak interaction.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,hep-ph,nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T17:39:06Z\"}"}
