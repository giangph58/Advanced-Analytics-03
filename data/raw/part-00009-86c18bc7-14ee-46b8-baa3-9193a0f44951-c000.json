{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00357v1\", \"title\": \"Non-reciprocal anti-aligning active mixtures: deriving the exact\\n  Boltzmann collision operator\", \"summary\": \"We consider the effect of non-reciprocity in a binary mixture of\\nself-propelled particles with anti-aligning interactions, where a particle of\\ntype A reacts differently to a particle of type B than vice versa. Starting\\nfrom a well-known microscopic Langevin-model for the particles, setting up the\\ncorresponding exact N-particle Fokker-Planck equation and making Boltzmann's\\nassumptions of low density and one-sided molecular chaos, the non-linear active\\nBoltzmann equation with the exact collision operator is derived. In this\\nderivation, the effect of phase-space compression and the build-up of\\npair-correlations during binary interactions is explicitly taken into account,\\nleading to a theoretical description beyond mean-field. This extends previous\\nresults for reciprocal interactions, where it was found that orientational\\norder can emerge in a system with purely anti-aligning interactions. Although\\nthe equations of motion are more complex than in the reciprocal system, the\\ntheory still leads to analytical expressions and predictions. Comparisons with\\nagent-based simulations show excellent quantitative agreement of the dynamic\\nand static behavior in the low density and/or small coupling limit.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech,cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T07:00:52Z\"}"}
