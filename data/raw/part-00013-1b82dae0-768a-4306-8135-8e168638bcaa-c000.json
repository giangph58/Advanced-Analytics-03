{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05186v1\", \"title\": \"Expansion of one-dimensional spinor gases from power-law traps\", \"summary\": \"Free expansion following the removal of axial confinement represents a\\nfundamental nonequilibrium scenario in the study of many-body ultracold gases.\\nUsing the stationary phase approximation, we analytically demonstrate that for\\nall one-dimensional spinor gases with repulsive contact interactions, whether\\nbosonic or fermionic, the asymptotic density and momentum distribution can be\\ndirectly determined from the quasimomentum distribution (Bethe rapidities) of\\nthe trapped gas. We efficiently obtain the quasimomentum distribution\\nnumerically by solving the integral equations that characterize the ground\\nstate of the integrable system within the local density approximation.\\nAdditionally, we derive analytical solutions for both weakly and strongly\\ninteracting regimes. Unlike in bosonic gases, where rapidity distributions and\\ndensity profiles vary significantly across interaction regimes, fermionic gases\\nmaintain similar profiles in both weakly and strongly interacting limits.\\nNotably, the gas expands self-similarly only when released from a harmonic\\ntrap. For other power-law trapping potentials, the asymptotic density profile\\nis strongly influenced by the initial confinement geometry. Our results extend\\nreadily to Bose-Fermi mixtures and finite temperatures.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T12:34:36Z\"}"}
