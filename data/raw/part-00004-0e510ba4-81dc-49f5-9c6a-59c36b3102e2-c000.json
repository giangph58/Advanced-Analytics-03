{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03229v1\", \"title\": \"Survey of Abstract Meaning Representation: Then, Now, Future\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents a survey of Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR), a\\nsemantic representation framework that captures the meaning of sentences\\nthrough a graph-based structure. AMR represents sentences as rooted, directed\\nacyclic graphs, where nodes correspond to concepts and edges denote\\nrelationships, effectively encoding the meaning of complex sentences. This\\nsurvey investigates AMR and its extensions, focusing on AMR capabilities. It\\nthen explores the parsing (text-to-AMR) and generation (AMR-to-text) tasks by\\nshowing traditional, current, and possible futures approaches. It also reviews\\nvarious applications of AMR including text generation, text classification, and\\ninformation extraction and information seeking. By analyzing recent\\ndevelopments and challenges in the field, this survey provides insights into\\nfuture directions for research and the potential impact of AMR on enhancing\\nmachine understanding of human language.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T06:45:40Z\"}"}
