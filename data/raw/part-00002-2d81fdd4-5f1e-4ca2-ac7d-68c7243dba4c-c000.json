{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19941v1\", \"title\": \"The Diffuse Solid Method for Wetting and Multiphase Fluid Simulations in\\n  Complex Geometries\", \"summary\": \"We develop a diffuse solid method that is versatile and accurate for modeling\\nwetting and multiphase flows in highly complex geometries. In this scheme, we\\nharness N + 1-component phase field models to investigate interface shapes and\\nflow dynamics of N fluid components, and we optimize how to constrain the\\nevolution of the component employed as the solid phase to conform to any\\npre-defined geometry. Implementations for phase field energy minimization and\\nlattice Boltzmann method are presented. Our approach does not need special\\ntreatment for the fluid-solid wetting boundary condition, which makes it simple\\nto implement. To demonstrate its broad applicability, we employ the diffuse\\nsolid method to explore wide-ranging examples, including droplet contact angle\\non a flat surface, particle adsorption on a fluid-fluid interface, critical\\npressure on micropillars and on Salvinia leaf structures, capillary rise\\nagainst gravity, Lucas-Washburn's law for capillary filling, and droplet motion\\non a sinusoidally undulated surface. Our proposed approach can be beneficial to\\ncomputationally study multiphase fluid interactions with textured solid\\nsurfaces that are ubiquitous in nature and engineering applications.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn,cond-mat.soft,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:12:06Z\"}"}
