This geometry has a\\ndegenerate metric, but there is a natural notion of flexibility. We study\\ninfinitesimal and finite flexibility, and classify all finitely flexible\\npolyhedral nets of arbitrary size. We show that there are just two classes, in\\ncontrast to Izmestiev's rather involved classification in Euclidean geometry,\\nfor size 3x3 only. Using these nets to initialize the optimization algorithms,\\nwe turn them into approximate Euclidean mechanisms. We also explore the smooth\\nversions of these classes.\", \"main_category\": \"math.MG\", \"categories\": \"math.MG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T12:38:47Z\"}"}
