UCF-Index is the state-of-the-art resolution to\\nsupport $(k,\\\\eta)$-core queries, allowing the $(k,\\\\eta)$-core for any\\ncombination of $k$ and $\\\\eta$ to be computed in an optimal time. However, this\\nindex constructed by current algorithm is usually incorrect. During\\ndecomposition, the key is to obtain the $k$-probabilities of its neighbors when\\nthe vertex with minimum $k$-probability is deleted. Current method uses\\nrecursive floating-point division to update it, which can lead to serious\\nerrors. We propose a correct and efficient index construction algorithm to\\naddress this issue. Firstly, we propose tight bounds on the $k$-probabilities\\nof the vertices that need to be updated, and the accurate $k$-probabilities are\\nrecalculated in an on-demand manner. Secondly, vertices partitioning and\\nprogressive refinement strategy is devised to search the vertex with the\\nminimum $k$-probability, thereby reducing initialization overhead for each $k$\\nand avoiding unnecessary recalculations. Finally, extensive experiments\\ndemonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our approach.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:10:39Z\"}"}
