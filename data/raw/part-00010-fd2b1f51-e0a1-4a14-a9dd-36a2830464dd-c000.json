{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15909v1\", \"title\": \"Synergizing RAG and Reasoning: A Systematic Review\", \"summary\": \"Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs), particularly in\\nreasoning capabilities, have propelled Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to\\nunprecedented levels. By synergizing retrieval mechanisms with advanced\\nreasoning, LLMs can now tackle increasingly complex problems. This paper\\npresents a systematic review of the collaborative interplay between RAG and\\nreasoning, clearly defining \\\"reasoning\\\" within the RAG context. It construct a\\ncomprehensive taxonomy encompassing multi-dimensional collaborative objectives,\\nrepresentative paradigms, and technical implementations, and analyze the\\nbidirectional synergy methods. Additionally, we critically evaluate current\\nlimitations in RAG assessment, including the absence of intermediate\\nsupervision for multi-step reasoning and practical challenges related to\\ncost-risk trade-offs. To bridge theory and practice, we provide practical\\nguidelines tailored to diverse real-world applications. Finally, we identify\\npromising research directions, such as graph-based knowledge integration,\\nhybrid model collaboration, and RL-driven optimization. Overall, this work\\npresents a theoretical framework and practical foundation to advance RAG\\nsystems in academia and industry, fostering the next generation of RAG\\nsolutions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T13:55:13Z\"}"}
