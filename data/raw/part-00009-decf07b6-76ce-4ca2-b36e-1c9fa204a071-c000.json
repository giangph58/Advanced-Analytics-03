{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06157v1\", \"title\": \"Hall Effect Thruster Forecasting using a Topological Approach for Data\\n  Assimilation\", \"summary\": \"Hall Effect Thrusters (HETs) are electric thrusters that eject heavy ionized\\ngas particles from the spacecraft to generate thrust. Although traditionally\\nthey were used for station keeping, recently They have been used for\\ninterplanetary space missions due to their high delta-V potential and their\\noperational longevity in contrast to other thrusters, e.g., chemical. However,\\nthe operation of HETs involves complex processes such as ionization of gases,\\nstrong magnetic fields, and complicated solar panel power supply interactions.\\nTherefore, their operation is extremely difficult to model thus necessitating\\nData Assimilation (DA) approaches for estimating and predicting their\\noperational states. Because HET's operating environment is often noisy with\\nnon-Gaussian sources, this significantly limits applicable DA tools. We\\ndescribe a topological approach for data assimilation that bypasses these\\nlimitations that does not depend on the noise model, and utilize it to forecast\\nspatiotemporal plume field states of HETs. Our approach is a generalization of\\nthe Topological Approach for Data Assimilation (TADA) method that allows\\nincluding different forecast functions. We show how TADA can be combined with\\nthe Long Short-Term Memory network for accurate forecasting. We then apply our\\napproach to high-fidelity Hall Effect Thruster (HET) simulation data from the\\nAir Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) rocket propulsion division where we\\ndemonstrate the forecast resiliency of TADA on noise contaminated,\\nhigh-dimensional data.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T15:52:50Z\"}"}
