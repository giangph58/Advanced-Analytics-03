If the\\ninjectivity radius of the boundary is larger than an explicit function of the\\nnormal injectivity radius of the boundary, we show that there is a negatively\\ncurved metric on the space obtained by coning each boundary component of M to a\\npoint. Moreover, we give explicit geometric conditions under which a locally\\nconvex subset of M gives rise to a locally convex subset of the cone-off.\\n  Group-theoretically, we conclude that the fundamental group of the cone-off\\nis hyperbolic and the image of the fundamental group of the coned-off locally\\nconvex subset is a quasi-convex subgroup.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GT\", \"categories\": \"math.GT,math.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T13:55:54Z\"}"}
