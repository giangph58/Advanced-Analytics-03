Our approach leverages the quantum-classical\\ncorrespondence between TOSPDC and its reverse classical process, three-wave\\nsum-frequency generation (TSFG), to efficiently estimate the PTG rate. We apply\\nthis framework to nonlinear metasurfaces supporting quasi-bound states in the\\ncontinuum (qBICs) in the optical range. From numerical analysis of\\nnon-collinear TSFG with degenerate input waves at qBIC wavelengths, we predict\\nwavelength-tunable three-photon emission with spatio-angular correlations.\\nThese findings establish a novel method for modelling TOSPDC and also highlight\\nthe potential of nonlinear resonant metasurfaces as compact free-space photon\\ntriplet sources with quantum state control.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T04:26:50Z\"}"}
