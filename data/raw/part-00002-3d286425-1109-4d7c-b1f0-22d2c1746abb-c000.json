We develop a\\nclosure principle for all FDR controlling procedures, i.e., we provide a\\ncharacterization based on e-values for all admissible FDR controlling\\nprocedures. We leverage this idea to formulate the closed eBH procedure, a\\n(usually strict) improvement over the eBH procedure for FDR control when\\nprovided with e-values. We demonstrate the practical performance of closed eBH\\nin simulations.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T04:36:12Z\"}"}
