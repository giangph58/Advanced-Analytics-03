{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20876v1\", \"title\": \"Chaos Around the Kerr Black Hole: its Effects on Entropy and the Shadow\", \"summary\": \"Massless or massive particles in unstable orbits around a Kerr black hole\\nexhibit chaotic motion when perturbed. They either plunge into the black hole\\nor escape to infinity after making some oscillations around the equatorial\\nplane. In both of these cases, chaotic motion causes information production. In\\nthe case of the photons that escape to infinity, it was recently suggested that\\nthis information can be used to resolve the subring structure of the shadow\\nimage and obtain more precise data about the black hole mass and spin. Here, we\\nextend this method to obtain more precise results by including the\\nnon-equatorial contributions to the Lyapunov exponents. In the other case of\\nmassive particles that plunge into the Kerr black hole, we show that the\\nassociated Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy derived from the Lyapunov exponents can be\\ninterpreted in the context of black hole thermodynamics and that it obeys\\nBekenstein's bound on the entropy of a physical material system. Thus, the\\nperturbed unstable orbits, either ending inside the black hole or at the\\nobserver's screen, have physical consequences.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.HE,hep-th,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T15:46:03Z\"}"}
