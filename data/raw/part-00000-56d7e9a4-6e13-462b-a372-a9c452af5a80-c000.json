{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16894v1\", \"title\": \"Spectrometer-Free Electron Spectromicroscopy\", \"summary\": \"We introduce an approach for performing spectrally resolved electron\\nmicroscopy without the need for an electron spectrometer. The method involves\\nan electron beam prepared as a coherent superposition of multiple paths, one of\\nwhich passes near a laser-irradiated specimen. These paths are subsequently\\nrecombined, and their interference is measured as a function of laser frequency\\nand beam position. Electron--light scattering introduces inelastic components\\ninto the interacting path, thereby disturbing the interference pattern. We\\nimplement this concept using two masks placed at conjugate image planes. The\\nmasks are complementary and act in tandem to fully suppress electron\\ntransmission in the absence of a specimen. However, electron interaction with\\nan illuminated specimen perturbs the imaging condition, enabling electron\\ntransmission through the system. For a fixed external light intensity, the\\ntransmitted electron current is proportional to the strength of the local\\noptical response in the material. The proposed technique does not require\\nmonochromatic electron beams, dramatically simplifying the design of spectrally\\nresolved electron microscopes.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T17:23:31Z\"}"}
