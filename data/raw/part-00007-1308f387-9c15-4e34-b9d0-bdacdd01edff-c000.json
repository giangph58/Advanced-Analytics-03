We characterize\\nthe junction by measurements of the magnetic field induced interference\\npattern, and the AC Josephson effect manifested as \\\"Shapiro steps\\\", examining\\ncurrent dependent hysteresis and junction dynamics. The latter can be tuned by\\ntemperature, gate voltage, and magnetic field. Finally, we examine the\\nevolution of the supercurrent when subjected to in-plane magnetic fields.\\nNotably, we observe a strong anisotropy in the supercurrent with respect to the\\norientation of the in-plane magnetic field. When the field is parallel to the\\ncurrent direction, the supercurrent is suppressed, and shows revivals with\\nincreasing magnetic field, whereas it remains almost unaffected when the field\\nis oriented in a perpendicular direction. We suggest that this anisotropy is\\ncaused by the dependence of supercurrent interference on the junction geometry.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:01:38Z\"}"}
