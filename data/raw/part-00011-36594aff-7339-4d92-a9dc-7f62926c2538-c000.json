In this work, we proposed an analytical form for\\ndescribing the iso-frequency contour of the hyperbolic polaritons, showcasing\\ntheir strictly hyperbolic nature. Such an analytical form is obtained based on\\nthe focusing behavior of the hyperbolic polaritons and verified by both the\\npublished data from commonly used hyperbolic media systems of the hyperbolic\\npolaritons and our own experimental characterizations on a hyperbolic\\nmetamaterial film. By presenting a concise and intuitive physical image, this\\nwork may provide a groundbreaking methodology in developing novel hyperbolic\\npolaritons based optical devices.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T16:57:35Z\"}"}
