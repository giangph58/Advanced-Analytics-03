This study introduces\\nthe SCU-Hand (Soft Conical Universal Robot Hand), a novel end-effector designed\\nto automate the task of scooping powdered samples from various container sizes\\nusing a robotic arm. The SCU-Hand employs a flexible, conical structure that\\nadapts to different container geometries through deformation, maintaining\\nconsistent contact without complex force sensing or machine learning-based\\ncontrol methods. Its reconfigurable mechanism allows for size adjustment,\\nenabling efficient scooping from diverse container types. By combining soft\\nrobotics principles with a sheet-morphing design, our end-effector achieves\\nhigh flexibility while retaining the necessary stiffness for effective powder\\nmanipulation. We detail the design principles, fabrication process, and\\nexperimental validation of the SCU-Hand. Experimental validation showed that\\nthe scooping capacity is about 20% higher than that of a commercial tool, with\\na scooping performance of more than 95% for containers of sizes between 67 mm\\nto 110 mm. This research contributes to laboratory automation by offering a\\ncost-effective, easily implementable solution for automating tasks such as\\nmaterials synthesis and characterization processes.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T06:24:34Z\"}"}
