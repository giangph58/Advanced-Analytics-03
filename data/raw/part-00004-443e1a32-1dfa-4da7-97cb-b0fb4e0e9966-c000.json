This paper concerns a similar result for certain\\nnon-quasi-Fuchsian manifolds~: those obtained by degenerating one end but not\\nthe other, i.e. those appearing in boundaries of Bers slices. More precisely,\\nwe show that such hyperbolic manifolds are uniquely determined by the end\\nstructure of the degenerated end and the bending lamination of the other. The\\nend structure consists of the parabolic locus, which is a multicurve, together\\nwith ending laminations or conformal structures on each components of its\\ncomplement.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GT\", \"categories\": \"math.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:24:55Z\"}"}
