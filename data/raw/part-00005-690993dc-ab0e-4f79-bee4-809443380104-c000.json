The Gottesman-Knill theorem\\nfurther motivates this argument by accentuating the importance of Clifford\\ncircuits and their role on this topic of simulation. In this work, we propose\\nand analyze use cases that come from quantum circuits that can be written as\\nproduct between a Clifford and a Non-Clifford unitary, these ranging from fully\\nclassical emulation, hybrid quantum-classical execution or even quantum\\nalgorithm simplification. To further complement this analysis, we make use of\\nZX-Calculus and its assets to detect a limiting border of these circuits that\\nwould allow for a separation between a Clifford section and a Non-Clifford\\nsection. To achieve this, we present a novel procedure for parsing ZX diagrams,\\nthat not only allows for the detection of this border but also simplifies the\\ncircuit extraction process.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T16:10:34Z\"}"}
