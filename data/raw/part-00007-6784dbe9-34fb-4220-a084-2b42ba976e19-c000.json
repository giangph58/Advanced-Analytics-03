{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21565v1\", \"title\": \"Towards proactive self-adaptive AI for non-stationary environments with\\n  dataset shifts\", \"summary\": \"Artificial Intelligence (AI) models deployed in production frequently face\\nchallenges in maintaining their performance in non-stationary environments.\\nThis issue is particularly noticeable in medical settings, where temporal\\ndataset shifts often occur. These shifts arise when the distributions of\\ntraining data differ from those of the data encountered during deployment over\\ntime. Further, new labeled data to continuously retrain AI is not typically\\navailable in a timely manner due to data access limitations. To address these\\nchallenges, we propose a proactive self-adaptive AI approach, or pro-adaptive,\\nwhere we model the temporal trajectory of AI parameters, allowing us to\\nshort-term forecast parameter values. To this end, we use polynomial spline\\nbases, within an extensible Functional Data Analysis framework. We validate our\\nmethodology with a logistic regression model addressing prior probability\\nshift, covariate shift, and concept shift. This validation is conducted on both\\na controlled simulated dataset and a publicly available real-world COVID-19\\ndataset from Mexico, with various shifts occurring between 2020 and 2024. Our\\nresults indicate that this approach enhances the performance of AI against\\nshifts compared to baseline stable models trained at different time distances\\nfrom the present, without requiring updated training data. This work lays the\\nfoundation for pro-adaptive AI research against dynamic, non-stationary\\nenvironments, being compatible with data protection, in resilient AI production\\nenvironments for health.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,I.2.8\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T12:09:59Z\"}"}
