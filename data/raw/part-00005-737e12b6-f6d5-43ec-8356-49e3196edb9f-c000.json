Our main result\\nis that the $g$-matrix of every vector configuration in $\\\\mathbf{R}^3$ is\\nnon-negative, which implies the Eckhoff--Linhart--Welzl conjecture in the case\\nwhere $d=n-4$.\\n  As a corollary, we obtain the following result about crossing numbers:\\nConsider a configuration $V\\\\subset S^2 \\\\subset \\\\mathbf{R}^3$ of $n$ unit\\nvectors, and connect every pair of vectors by the unique shortest geodesic arc\\nbetween them in the unit sphere $S^2$. This yields a drawing of the complete\\ngraph $K_n$ in $S^2$, which we call a spherical arc drawing. Complementing\\nprevious results for rectilinear drawings, we show that the number of crossings\\nin any spherical arc drawing of $K_n$ is at least $\\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\lfloor\\n\\\\frac{n}{2}\\\\rfloor \\\\lfloor \\\\frac{n-1}{2}\\\\rfloor \\\\lfloor \\\\frac{n-2}{2}\\\\rfloor\\n\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{n-3}{2}\\\\rfloor$, which equals the conjectured value of the\\ncrossing number of $K_n$. Moreover, the lower bound is attained if $V$ is\\nconeighborly, i.e., if every open linear halfspace contains at least $\\\\lfloor\\n(n-2)/2 \\\\rfloor$ of the vectors in $V$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,cs.CG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:10:15Z\"}"}
