{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20758v1\", \"title\": \"Influence network reconstruction from discrete time-series of count data\\n  modelled by multidimensional Hawkes processes\", \"summary\": \"Identifying key influencers from time series data without a known prior\\nnetwork structure is a challenging problem in various applications, from crime\\nanalysis to social media. While much work has focused on event-based time\\nseries (timestamp) data, fewer methods address count data, where event counts\\nare recorded in fixed intervals. We develop network inference methods for both\\nbatched and sequential count data. Here the strong network connection\\nrepresents the key influences among the nodes. We introduce an ensemble-based\\nalgorithm, rooted in the expectation-maximization (EM) framework, and\\ndemonstrate its utility to identify node dynamics and connections through a\\ndiscrete-time Cox or Hawkes process. For the linear multidimensional Hawkes\\nmodel, we employ a minimization-majorization (MM) approach, allowing for\\nparallelized inference of networks. For sequential inference, we use a\\nsecond-order approximation of the Bayesian inference problem. Under certain\\nassumptions, a rank-1 update for the covariance matrix reduces computational\\ncosts. We validate our methods on synthetic data and real-world datasets,\\nincluding email communications within European academic communities. Our\\napproach effectively reconstructs underlying networks, accounting for both\\nexcitation and diffusion influences. This work advances network reconstruction\\nfrom count data in real-world scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:37:36Z\"}"}
