{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20713v1\", \"title\": \"AIM: A User-friendly GUI Workflow program for Isotherm Fitting, Mixture\\n  Prediction, Isosteric Heat of Adsorption Estimation, and Breakthrough\\n  Simulation\", \"summary\": \"Adsorption breakthrough modeling often requires complex software environments\\nand scripting, limiting accessibility for many practitioners. We present AIM, a\\nMATLAB-based graphical user interface (GUI) application that streamlines\\nfixed-bed adsorption analysis through an integrated workflow for isotherm\\nfitting, heat of adsorption estimation, mixture prediction, and multicomponent\\nbreakthrough simulations. AIM's intuitive GUI requires no coding and supports a\\nbroad isotherm library (e.g., Langmuir, Toth, Dubinin-Astakhov,\\nStructural-Transition-Adsorption). It also enables non-isothermal breakthrough\\nsimulations with axial dispersion. Case studies, such as Xe/Kr breakthrough\\ncurves in SBMOF-1, closely match the results from other software applications,\\nsuch as RUPTURA. Mixture predictions can be done using the Ideal Adsorbed\\nSolution Theory (IAST) and Extended Langmuir models, while isosteric heats are\\nderived from Clausius-Clapeyron or Virial equations. Users can export detailed\\ncolumn and outlet profiles (e.g., composition, temperature) in multiple\\nformats, enhancing reproducibility and data sharing among practitioners.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T12:45:06Z\"}"}
