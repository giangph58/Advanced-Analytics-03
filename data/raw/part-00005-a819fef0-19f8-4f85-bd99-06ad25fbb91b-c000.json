By the fact that the burning number of\\na connected graph is the minimum burning number of its spanning trees, our work\\nfocuses on identifying the largest order of a general tree with a given burning\\nnumber up to homeomorphism. In this work, we propose the concept of admissible\\nsequences over a homeomorphically irreducible tree in addition to developing a\\ngeneral framework. We then determine whether an admissible sequence induces a\\ntree with a given burning number of the largest order. Additionally, we obtain\\nsome results on the smallest attainable diameter of an $n$-spider having the\\nlargest order with a given burning number.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T04:45:57Z\"}"}
