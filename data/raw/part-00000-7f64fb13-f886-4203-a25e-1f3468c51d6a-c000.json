In the direct problem, we prove that the operator is well-posed,\\ngiven initial and boundary data in suitable function spaces. In the inverse\\nproblem, we prove uniqueness of the lower order time-dependent perturbations\\nfrom the partial input-output operator. The restriction in the measurements are\\nconsidered by restricting some of the Neumann data over a portion of the\\nlateral boundary.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T13:56:50Z\"}"}
