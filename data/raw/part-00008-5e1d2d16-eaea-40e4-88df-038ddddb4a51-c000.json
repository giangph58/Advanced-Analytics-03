Recently, the Mamba architecture based on selective\\nstate-space models (S6) has demonstrated great advantages in long sequence\\nmodeling. However, the unique properties of hyperspectral data, such as high\\ndimensionality and feature inlining, pose challenges to the application of\\nMamba to HSI classification. To compensate for these shortcomings, we propose\\nan full-field interaction multi-groups Mamba framework (HS-Mamba), which adopts\\na strategy different from pixel-patch based or whole-image based, but combines\\nthe advantages of both. The patches cut from the whole image are sent to\\nmulti-groups Mamba, combined with positional information to perceive local\\ninline features in the spatial and spectral domains, and the whole image is\\nsent to a lightweight attention module to enhance the global feature\\nrepresentation ability. Specifically, HS-Mamba consists of a dual-channel\\nspatial-spectral encoder (DCSS-encoder) module and a lightweight global inline\\nattention (LGI-Att) branch. The DCSS-encoder module uses multiple groups of\\nMamba to decouple and model the local features of dual-channel sequences with\\nnon-overlapping patches. The LGI-Att branch uses a lightweight compressed and\\nextended attention module to perceive the global features of the spatial and\\nspectral domains of the unsegmented whole image. By fusing local and global\\nfeatures, high-precision classification of hyperspectral images is achieved.\\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed HS-Mamba,\\noutperforming state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark HSI datasets.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T06:13:02Z\"}"}
