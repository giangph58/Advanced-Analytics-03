We introduce a\\ntransducer figure of merit (FOM) that combines pump absorption and probe\\nreflectance modulation at different wavelengths. Our findings reveal that\\nmaterials such as sapphire and aluminum nitride can outperform metals by up to\\ntwo orders of magnitude. These results position dielectric materials as\\ncompelling candidates for next-generation thermal metrology, broadening the\\ndesign space for optical thermometry, with strong implications for\\nhigh-resolution thermal mapping and characterization of layered device\\nstructures based on phonon probing.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T04:36:01Z\"}"}
