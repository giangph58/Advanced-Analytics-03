{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10439v1\", \"title\": \"Bayesian Analysis of Interpretable Aging across Thousands of Lithium-ion\\n  Battery Cycles\", \"summary\": \"The Doyle-Fuller-Newman (DFN) model is a common mechanistic model for\\nlithium-ion batteries. The reaction rate constant and diffusivity within the\\nDFN model are key parameters that directly affect the movement of lithium ions,\\nthereby offering explanations for cell aging. This work investigates the\\nability to uniquely estimate each electrode's diffusion coefficients and\\nreaction rate constants of 95 Tesla Model 3 cells with a nickel cobalt aluminum\\noxide (NCA) cathode and silicon oxide--graphite\\n(LiC$_\\\\text{6}$--SiO$_{\\\\text{x}}$) anode. The parameters are estimated at\\nintermittent diagnostic cycles over the lifetime of each cell. The four\\nparameters are estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for uncertainty\\nquantification (UQ) for a total of 7776 cycles at discharge C-rates of C/5, 1C,\\nand 2C. While one or more anode parameters are uniquely identifiable over every\\ncell's lifetime, cathode parameters become identifiable at mid- to end-of-life,\\nindicating measurable resistive growth in the cathode. The contribution of key\\nparameters to the state of health (SOH) is expressed as a power law. This model\\nfor SOH shows a high consistency with the MCMC results performed over the\\noverall lifespan of each cell. Our approach suggests that effective diagnosis\\nof aging can be achieved by predicting the trajectories of the parameters\\ncontributing to cell aging. As such, extending our analysis with more\\nphysically accurate models building on DFN may lead to more identifiable\\nparameters and further improved aging predictions.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:31:16Z\"}"}
