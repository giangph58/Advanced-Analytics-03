It is shown that\\nin the general case the properties of the medium causing dichroism can be\\ncharacterized by only two parameters, {\\\\Delta}x and {\\\\Delta}y, while in the\\ncase of complete mixing - by a single parameter {\\\\Delta}. Expressions that\\nrelate these parameters to the transition probabilities are provided, as is an\\nextension of the theory for the case of incomplete mixing of sublevels of the\\nexcited state. The single-beam scheme for recording linear dichroism signals,\\nwhich is of greatest interest from a practical point of view, is investigated.\\nIt is shown that incomplete mixing can lead to inversion of dichroism signals\\nin systems including more than one optical transition. A comparison with the\\nresults of an experimental study of dichroism in alkali metal (cesium) vapors\\nis made.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T12:56:03Z\"}"}
