{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03448v1\", \"title\": \"AquaticVision: Benchmarking Visual SLAM in Underwater Environment with\\n  Events and Frames\", \"summary\": \"Many underwater applications, such as offshore asset inspections, rely on\\nvisual inspection and detailed 3D reconstruction. Recent advancements in\\nunderwater visual SLAM systems for aquatic environments have garnered\\nsignificant attention in marine robotics research. However, existing underwater\\nvisual SLAM datasets often lack groundtruth trajectory data, making it\\ndifficult to objectively compare the performance of different SLAM algorithms\\nbased solely on qualitative results or COLMAP reconstruction. In this paper, we\\npresent a novel underwater dataset that includes ground truth trajectory data\\nobtained using a motion capture system. Additionally, for the first time, we\\nrelease visual data that includes both events and frames for benchmarking\\nunderwater visual positioning. By providing event camera data, we aim to\\nfacilitate the development of more robust and advanced underwater visual SLAM\\nalgorithms. The use of event cameras can help mitigate challenges posed by\\nextremely low light or hazy underwater conditions.
