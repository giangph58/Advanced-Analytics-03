{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12129v1\", \"title\": \"Anti-Aesthetics: Protecting Facial Privacy against Customized\\n  Text-to-Image Synthesis\", \"summary\": \"The rise of customized diffusion models has spurred a boom in personalized\\nvisual content creation, but also poses risks of malicious misuse, severely\\nthreatening personal privacy and copyright protection. Some studies show that\\nthe aesthetic properties of images are highly positively correlated with human\\nperception of image quality. Inspired by this, we approach the problem from a\\nnovel and intriguing aesthetic perspective to degrade the generation quality of\\nmaliciously customized models, thereby achieving better protection of facial\\nidentity. Specifically, we propose a Hierarchical Anti-Aesthetic (HAA)\\nframework to fully explore aesthetic cues, which consists of two key branches:\\n1) Global Anti-Aesthetics: By establishing a global anti-aesthetic reward\\nmechanism and a global anti-aesthetic loss, it can degrade the overall\\naesthetics of the generated content; 2) Local Anti-Aesthetics: A local\\nanti-aesthetic reward mechanism and a local anti-aesthetic loss are designed to\\nguide adversarial perturbations to disrupt local facial identity. By seamlessly\\nintegrating both branches, our HAA effectively achieves the goal of\\nanti-aesthetics from a global to a local level during customized generation.\\nExtensive experiments show that HAA outperforms existing SOTA methods largely\\nin identity removal, providing a powerful tool for protecting facial privacy\\nand copyright.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T14:44:00Z\"}"}
