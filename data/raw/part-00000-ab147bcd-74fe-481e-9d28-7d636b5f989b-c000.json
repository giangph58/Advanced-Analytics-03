While the indirect\\ntechniques to probe the bulk superconducting properties of LaRh$_3$B$_2$\\nindicate a conventional isotropic order parameter, we show that the direct\\nspectroscopic determination of the superconducting energy gap reveals an\\nanomalous suppression of Andreev reflection between LaRh$_3$B$_2$ and a normal\\nmetal. This observation hints to the presence of incomplete superconducting gap\\nformation, at least along certain momentum directions, and consequent low-lying\\nquasiparticle states. An analysis of multiple Andreev reflection spectra\\ncaptured at different points on the surface of LaRh$_3$B$_2$ reveals a\\ndistribution of the superconducting energy gap which is consistent with an\\nanisotropic superconducting order parameter.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T10:36:49Z\"}"}
