{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21667v1\", \"title\": \"From Precision to Perception: User-Centred Evaluation of Keyword\\n  Extraction Algorithms for Internet-Scale Contextual Advertising\", \"summary\": \"Keyword extraction is a foundational task in natural language processing,\\nunderpinning countless real-world applications. A salient example is contextual\\nadvertising, where keywords help predict the topical congruence between ads and\\ntheir surrounding media contexts to enhance advertising effectiveness. Recent\\nadvances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models, have\\nimproved keyword extraction capabilities but also introduced concerns about\\ncomputational cost. Moreover, although the end-user experience is of vital\\nimportance, human evaluation of keyword extraction performances remains\\nunder-explored. This study provides a comparative evaluation of three prevalent\\nkeyword extraction algorithms that vary in complexity: TF-IDF, KeyBERT, and\\nLlama 2. To evaluate their effectiveness, a mixed-methods approach is employed,\\ncombining quantitative benchmarking with qualitative assessments from 552\\nparticipants through three survey-based experiments. Findings indicate a slight\\nuser preference for KeyBERT, which offers a favourable balance between\\nperformance and computational efficiency compared to the other two algorithms.\\nDespite a strong overall preference for gold-standard keywords, differences\\nbetween the algorithmic outputs are not statistically significant, highlighting\\na long-overlooked gap between traditional precision-focused metrics and\\nuser-perceived algorithm efficiency. The study highlights the importance of\\nuser-centred evaluation methodologies and proposes analytical tools to support\\ntheir implementation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:10:00Z\"}"}
