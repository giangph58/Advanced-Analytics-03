{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05794v1\", \"title\": \"DefMamba: Deformable Visual State Space Model\", \"summary\": \"Recently, state space models (SSM), particularly Mamba, have attracted\\nsignificant attention from scholars due to their ability to effectively balance\\ncomputational efficiency and performance. However, most existing visual Mamba\\nmethods flatten images into 1D sequences using predefined scan orders, which\\nresults the model being less capable of utilizing the spatial structural\\ninformation of the image during the feature extraction process. To address this\\nissue, we proposed a novel visual foundation model called DefMamba. This model\\nincludes a multi-scale backbone structure and deformable mamba (DM) blocks,\\nwhich dynamically adjust the scanning path to prioritize important information,\\nthus enhancing the capture and processing of relevant input features. By\\ncombining a deformable scanning(DS) strategy, this model significantly improves\\nits ability to learn image structures and detects changes in object details.\\nNumerous experiments have shown that DefMamba achieves state-of-the-art\\nperformance in various visual tasks, including image classification, object\\ndetection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. The code is open\\nsource on DefMamba.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T08:22:54Z\"}"}
