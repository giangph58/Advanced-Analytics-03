{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04220v1\", \"title\": \"Uninorms via two comparable closure operators on bounded lattices\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we propose novel methods for constructing uninorms using two\\ncomparable closure operators or, alternatively, two comparable interior\\noperators on bounded lattices. These methods are developed under the necessary\\nand sufficient conditions imposed on these operators. Specifically, the\\nconstruction of uninorms for $(x ,y )\\\\in ]0 ,e [\\\\times]e ,1 [ \\\\cup ]e ,1\\n[\\\\times]0 ,e [$ depends not only on the structure of the bounded lattices but\\nalso on the chosen closure operators (or interior operators). Consequently, the\\nresulting uninorms do not necessarily belong to $\\\\mathcal{U}_{min}^{*}\\\\cup\\n\\\\mathcal{U}_{min}^{1}$ (or $\\\\mathcal{U}_{max}^{*}\\\\cup\\\\mathcal{U}_{max}^{0}$).\\nMoreover, we present the degenerate cases of the aforementioned results, which\\nare constructed using only a single closure operator or a single interior\\noperator. Some of these cases correspond to well-known results documented in\\nthe literature.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA,math.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:19:28Z\"}"}
