{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17482v1\", \"title\": \"A New Age-Activity Relation For Solar Analogs that Accounts for\\n  Metallicity\", \"summary\": \"Determining stellar ages is challenging, particularly for cooler\\nmain-sequence stars. Magnetic evolution offers an observational alternative for\\nage estimation via the age-chromospheric activity (AC) relation. We evaluate\\nthe impact of metallicity on this relation using near one-solar-mass stars\\nacross a wide metallicity range. We analyze a sample of 358 solar-type stars\\nwith precise spectroscopic parameters determined through a line-by-line\\ndifferential technique and with ages derived using Yonsei-Yale isochrones. We\\nmeasured chromospheric activity (S-index) using high-quality HARPS spectra,\\ncalibrated to the Mount Wilson system, and converted to the\\n$R^{\\\\prime}_{\\\\mathrm HK}(T_{\\\\mathrm{eff}})$ index with a temperature-based\\nphotospheric correction. Our findings show that the AC relation for\\n$R^{\\\\prime}_{\\\\mathrm HK}(T_{\\\\mathrm{eff}})$ is strongly influenced by\\nmetallicity. We propose a new age-activity-metallicity relation for solar-type\\nmain-sequence (MS) stars ($\\\\log{g} \\\\gtrsim 4.2 $) with temperatures 5370\\n$\\\\lesssim$ $T_{\\\\mathrm{eff}}$ $\\\\lesssim$ 6530 K and metallicities from -0.7 to\\n+0.3 dex. We show that taking metallicity into account significantly enhances\\nchromospheric ages' reliability, reducing the residuals' root mean square (RMS)\\nrelative to isochronal ages from 2.6 Gyr to 0.92 Gyr. This reflects a\\nconsiderable improvement in the errors of chromospheric ages, from 53\\\\% to\\n15\\\\%. The precision level achieved in this work is also consistent with\\nprevious age-activity calibration from our group using solar twins.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T12:19:40Z\"}"}
