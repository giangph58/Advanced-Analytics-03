The question\\nis whether there exist vertex-disjoint paths $P_1,\\\\dots,P_k$ in $G$ so that\\neach $P_i$ is a shortest path between $s_i$ and $t_i$. While the problem is\\nknown to be W[1]-hard in general, we show that it is fixed-parameter tractable\\non planar graphs with positive edge weights. Specifically, we propose an\\nalgorithm for Planar Disjoint Shortest Paths with running time $2^{O(k\\\\log\\nk)}\\\\cdot n^{O(1)}$. Notably, our parameter dependency is better than\\nstate-of-the-art $2^{O(k^2)}$ for the Planar Disjoint Paths problem, where the\\nsought paths are not required to be shortest paths.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T09:22:23Z\"}"}
