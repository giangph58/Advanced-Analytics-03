{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04480v1\", \"title\": \"TrajEvo: Designing Trajectory Prediction Heuristics via LLM-driven\\n  Evolution\", \"summary\": \"Trajectory prediction is a crucial task in modeling human behavior,\\nespecially in fields as social robotics and autonomous vehicle navigation.\\nTraditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often lack accuracy, while\\nrecently proposed deep learning approaches suffer from computational cost, lack\\nof explainability, and generalization issues that limit their practical\\nadoption. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a framework that leverages Large\\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to automatically design trajectory prediction\\nheuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to generate and refine\\nprediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We introduce a\\nCross-Generation Elite Sampling to promote population diversity and a\\nStatistics Feedback Loop allowing the LLM to analyze alternative predictions.\\nOur evaluations show TrajEvo outperforms previous heuristic methods on the\\nETH-UCY datasets, and remarkably outperforms both heuristics and deep learning\\nmethods when generalizing to the unseen SDD dataset. TrajEvo represents a first\\nstep toward automated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory\\nprediction heuristics. We make our source code publicly available to foster\\nfuture research at https://github.com/ai4co/trajevo.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.NE,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:51:43Z\"}"}
