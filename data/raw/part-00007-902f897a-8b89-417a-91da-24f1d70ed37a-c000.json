We show in a model independent way that this class of potentials\\npredicts both a spectral index $n_s$ and a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ which fit\\nthe $1\\\\sigma$ region of the combination ACT+Planck data for a wide choice of\\nthe parameters. We also provide a numerical fit for the parameter space of this\\nmodels in the case of a simple quadratic and quartic fractional potential.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.CO,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T17:53:22Z\"}"}
