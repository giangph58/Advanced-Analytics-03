{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21789v1\", \"title\": \"Anomaly-Driven Approach for Enhanced Prostate Cancer Segmentation\", \"summary\": \"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays an important role in identifying\\nclinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa), yet automated methods face\\nchallenges such as data imbalance, variable tumor sizes, and a lack of\\nannotated data. This study introduces Anomaly-Driven U-Net (adU-Net), which\\nincorporates anomaly maps derived from biparametric MRI sequences into a deep\\nlearning-based segmentation framework to improve csPCa identification. We\\nconduct a comparative analysis of anomaly detection methods and evaluate the\\nintegration of anomaly maps into the segmentation pipeline. Anomaly maps,\\ngenerated using Fixed-Point GAN reconstruction, highlight deviations from\\nnormal prostate tissue, guiding the segmentation model to potential cancerous\\nregions. We compare the performance by using the average score, computed as the\\nmean of the AUROC and Average Precision (AP). On the external test set, adU-Net\\nachieves the best average score of 0.618, outperforming the baseline nnU-Net\\nmodel (0.605). The results demonstrate that incorporating anomaly detection\\ninto segmentation improves generalization and performance, particularly with\\nADC-based anomaly maps, offering a promising direction for automated csPCa\\nidentification.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T16:48:00Z\"}"}
