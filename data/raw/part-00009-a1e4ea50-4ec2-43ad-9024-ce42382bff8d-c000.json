{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00678v1\", \"title\": \"Photonic Crystal Microring Resonators on a Hybrid Silicon\\n  Nitride-on-Lithium Niobate Platform\", \"summary\": \"Photonic-crystal resonators (PhCRs) have been widely used in nonlinear\\nintegrated photonics for frequency engineering applications. A\\nmicrowave-assisted frequency converter based on PhCRs highlights its precise\\ncontrol of frequency (enabled by creation of a pair of supermodes by a\\ncorrugated PhCR) and bidirectional frequency conversion. In this paper, we\\ndemonstrate a high-quality PhCR on a hybrid silicon nitride-on-lithium\\nniobate-on-insulator (SiN-on-LNOI) platform for the first time for\\nvoltage-driven flexible frequency conversion using the electro-optic effect\\n(0.85 pm/V). The fabricated PhCR has a large supermode splitting bandwidth =\\n14.6 GHz and an intrinsic quality factor (Q) = 147,000. Using different\\nperiodic corrugation amplitudes in the fabricated PhCRs enables the precise\\ncontrol of mode splitting with a ratio of 93.5 MHz/nm between the mode\\nsplitting bandwidth and the corrugation amplitude.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T17:36:41Z\"}"}
