{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23863v1\", \"title\": \"GRACEFUL: A Learned Cost Estimator For UDFs\", \"summary\": \"User-Defined-Functions (UDFs) are a pivotal feature in modern DBMS, enabling\\nthe extension of native DBMS functionality with custom logic. However, the\\nintegration of UDFs into query optimization processes poses significant\\nchallenges, primarily due to the difficulty of estimating UDF execution costs.\\nConsequently, existing cost models in DBMS optimizers largely ignore UDFs or\\nrely on static assumptions, resulting in suboptimal performance for queries\\ninvolving UDFs. In this paper, we introduce GRACEFUL, a novel learned cost\\nmodel to make accurate cost predictions of query plans with UDFs enabling\\noptimization decisions for UDFs in DBMS. For example, as we show in our\\nevaluation, using our cost model, we can achieve 50x speedups through informed\\npull-up/push-down filter decisions of the UDF compared to the standard case\\nwhere always a filter push-down is applied. Additionally, we release a\\nsynthetic dataset of over 90,000 UDF queries to promote further research in\\nthis area.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DB\", \"categories\": \"cs.DB\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T09:09:12Z\"}"}
