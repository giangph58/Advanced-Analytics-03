They can also be considered as\\ngeneralized splines over modules.\\n  The main goal of this paper is to study the $R$-module structure of extending\\ngeneralized splines. We concentrate on two following questions: which of the\\nresults for general splines extend to generalized splines over modules and if\\nthere is an algorithm or an explicit formula for special basis classes, called\\na flow up basis, for generalized splines over modules. We show that certain\\nresults concerning generalized splines can be extended to a setting where each\\nvertex $v$ is assigned a module $M_v=m_v\\\\mathbb Z$. We provide an algorithm to\\nconstruct a special basis for generalized splines over these modules on paths.\\nAdditionally, we introduce a new technique to construct a flow-up basis on\\narbitrary graphs using the idea of an algorithm on paths.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T11:42:55Z\"}"}
