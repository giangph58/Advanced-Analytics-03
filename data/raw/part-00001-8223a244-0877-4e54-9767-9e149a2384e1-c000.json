We present the\\nutilized proof-of-concept chip designs for qubit- and carrier chip, as well as\\nthe respective front-end and back-end fabrication techniques. In\\ncharacterization of the newly developed microbump technology based on\\nmetallized KOH-etched Si-islands, we observe a superconducting transition of\\nthe used metal stacks and radio frequency (RF) signal transfer through the bump\\nconnection with negligible attenuation. In time-domain spectroscopy of the\\nqubits we find high yield qubit excitation with energy relaxation times of up\\nto 15 us.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T11:34:28Z\"}"}
