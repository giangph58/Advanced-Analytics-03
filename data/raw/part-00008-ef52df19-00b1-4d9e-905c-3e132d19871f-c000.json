By analyzing reionization\\ntiming maps, we characterize ionization front velocities and curvatures and\\ntheir dependence on the density structure of the intergalactic medium (IGM).\\nThe velocity distribution of ionization fronts in the simulations indicates\\nthat while the barrier-crossing analytical model captures the overall shape in\\nhigh-velocity regions, it fails to reproduce the low-velocity tail,\\nhighlighting the non-Gaussian nature of the IGM's density field. Ionization\\nfront velocities are inversely correlated with local density, propagating\\nfaster in underdense regions and more slowly in overdense environments. Faster\\nionization fronts also lead to higher post-ionization temperatures, reaching a\\nplateau at $\\\\sim 2 \\\\times 10^4$ K for velocities exceeding 3000 km/s. Examining\\ncurvature statistics further establishes a connection between ionization front\\nstructure and the normalized density contrast $\\\\nu$, with trends in overdense\\nregions aligning well with barrier-crossing model predictions, while deviations\\nappear in underdense environments due to model limitations. These results\\nprovide a detailed characterization of ionization front dynamics and their\\ninteraction with the underlying density field, bridging small-scale\\nreionization physics with large-scale observables such as the 21 cm signal and\\nthe IGM's thermal history.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:59:59Z\"}"}
