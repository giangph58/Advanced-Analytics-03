While these formalisms are\\noften informally described as capturing causal knowledge, there is a lack of a\\nformal theory characterizing the type of knowledge required to predict the\\neffects of external interventions. This work introduces the theoretical\\nframework of causal systems to clarify Aristotle's distinction between\\nknowledge that and knowledge why within artificial intelligence. By\\ninterpreting existing artificial intelligence technologies as causal systems,\\nit investigates the corresponding types of knowledge. Furthermore, it argues\\nthat predicting the effects of external interventions is feasible only with\\nknowledge why, providing a more precise understanding of the knowledge\\nnecessary for such tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.LO,I.2.4\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T09:37:05Z\"}"}
