These\\nequations model large-scale atmospheric flows. Our proof uses a particle\\ndiscretisation and semi-discrete optimal transport techniques. We show that, if\\nthe initial data is a discrete measure, then the compressible SG equations\\nadmit a unique, twice continuously differentiable, energy-conserving and\\nglobal-in-time solution. In general, by discretising the initial measure by\\nparticles and sending the number of particles to infinity, we show that for any\\ncompactly supported initial measure there exists a global-in-time solution of\\nthe compressible SG equations that is Lipschitz in time. This significantly\\ngeneralises the original results due to Cullen and Maroofi (2003), and it\\nprovides the theoretical foundation for the design of numerical schemes using\\nsemi-discrete optimal transport to solve the 3D compressible SG equations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:21:04Z\"}"}
