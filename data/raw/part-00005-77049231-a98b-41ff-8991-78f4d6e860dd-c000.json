{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19832v1\", \"title\": \"Identifying the Frontier Structural Function and Bounding Mean\\n  Deviations\", \"summary\": \"This paper analyzes a model in which an outcome variable equals the\\ndifference between a frontier function of inputs and a nonnegative unobserved\\ndeviation. If zero is in the support of the deviation at a given input value,\\nthen the frontier function is identified by the maximum outcome there. This\\nobviates the need for instrumental variables. Implementation requires allowing\\nfor the distribution of deviations to depend on inputs, thus not ruling out\\nendogenous inputs and ensuring the estimated frontier is not merely a constant\\nshift of a biased conditional expectation. Including random errors results in a\\nstochastic frontier analysis model generalized to allow the joint distribution\\nof deviations and errors to depend on inputs. If the minimum deviation is a\\nfunction of inputs, then we derive a lower bound for the mean deviation using\\nvariance and skewness, without making parametric distributional assumptions. We\\napply our results to a frontier production function, with deviations\\nrepresenting inefficiencies.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.EM\", \"categories\": \"econ.EM,econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:34:54Z\"}"}
