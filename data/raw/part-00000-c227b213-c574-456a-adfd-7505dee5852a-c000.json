{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21261v1\", \"title\": \"Multi-Domain Causal Discovery in Bijective Causal Models\", \"summary\": \"We consider the problem of causal discovery (a.k.a., causal structure\\nlearning) in a multi-domain setting. We assume that the causal functions are\\ninvariant across the domains, while the distribution of the exogenous noise may\\nvary. Under causal sufficiency (i.e., no confounders exist), we show that the\\ncausal diagram can be discovered under less restrictive functional assumptions\\ncompared to previous work. What enables causal discovery in this setting is\\nbijective generation mechanisms (BGM), which ensures that the functional\\nrelation between the exogenous noise $E$ and the endogenous variable $Y$ is\\nbijective and differentiable in both directions at every level of the cause\\nvariable $X = x$. BGM generalizes a variety of models including additive noise\\nmodel, LiNGAM, post-nonlinear model, and location-scale noise model. Further,\\nwe derive a statistical test to find the parents set of the target variable.\\nExperiments on various synthetic and real-world datasets validate our\\ntheoretical findings.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T02:30:10Z\"}"}
