{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13168v1\", \"title\": \"Restoring Heisenberg scaling in time via autonomous quantum error\\n  correction\", \"summary\": \"We establish a sufficient condition under which autonomous quantum error\\ncorrection (AutoQEC) can effectively restore Heisenberg scaling (HS) in quantum\\nmetrology. Specifically, we show that if all Lindblad operators associated with\\nthe noise commute with the signal Hamiltonian and a particular constrained\\nlinear equation admits a solution, then an ancilla-free AutoQEC scheme with\\nfinite $R$ (where $R$ represents the ratio between the engineered dissipation\\nrate for AutoQEC and the noise rate,) can approximately preserve HS with\\ndesired small additive error $\\\\epsilon > 0$ over any time interval $0 \\\\leq t\\n\\\\leq T$. We emphasize that the error scales as $ \\\\epsilon = O(\\\\kappa T / R^c) $\\nwith $c \\\\geq 1$, indicating that the required $R$ decreases significantly with\\nincreasing $c$ to achieve a desired error. Furthermore, we discuss that if the\\nsufficient condition is not satisfied, logical errors may be induced that\\ncannot be efficiently corrected by the canonical AutoQEC framework. Finally, we\\nnumerically verify our analytical results by employing the concrete example of\\nphase estimation under dephasing noise.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:59:10Z\"}"}
