Quantitative analysis of\\nwave-particle duality aims to establish a complementary relation between the\\nparticle and wave properties. Beyond the conventional quantitative analysis\\ndepending on special choice of quantum information measures, we are aimed to\\nprovide a measure-independent complementary relation via coherence. By\\nemploying maximally coherent states in the set of all states with fixed\\ndiagonal elements, a measure-independent complementary relation is proposed.\\nBased on this, we give a measure-independent description of\\nwave-particle-mixedness triality in d-path interferometers. Our complementary\\nrelations reveal the relationship between wave-particle duality and quantum\\ncoherence, and also give a justification to coherence as it truly brings out\\nthe wave nature of quantum systems at its heart.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T13:09:31Z\"}"}
