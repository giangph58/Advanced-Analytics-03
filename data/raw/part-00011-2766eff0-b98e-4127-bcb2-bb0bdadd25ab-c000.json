Our\\nresult provides quantitative information in the form of an explicit and\\neffective construction of a rate of convergence for this process, both in mean\\nand almost surely, that is moreover highly uniform in the sense that it only\\ndepends on very few data of the surrounding objects involved in the iteration.\\nWe then apply this result to derive new quantitative versions of well-known\\nconcepts and theorems from stochastic approximation, in particular providing\\neffective rates for a variant of the Robbins-Siegmund theorem, Dvoretzky's\\nconvergence theorem, as well as the convergence of stochastic quasi-Fej\\\\'er\\nmonotone sequences, the latter of which formulated in a novel and highly\\ngeneral metric context. We utilize the classic and widely studied Robbins-Monro\\nprocedure as a template to evaluate our quantitative results and their\\napplicability in greater detail. We conclude by illustrating the breadth of\\npotential further applications with a brief discussion on a variety of other\\nwell-known iterative procedures from stochastic approximation, covering a range\\nof different applied scenarios to which our methods can be immediately applied.\\nThroughout, we isolate and discuss special cases of our results which even\\nallow for the construction of fast, and in particular linear, rates.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.LG,math.LO,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T13:11:26Z\"}"}
