Such ensembles\\nprovide a model for the final states when isolated quantum systems thermalize,\\nas they can reproduce thermal properties locally, while being globally pure. By\\nan analysis using real replicas and the coherent state representation of\\nGaussian states we show that the average entanglement entropy of a small\\nsubsystem is the same as the von Neumann entropy of a mixed Gaussian state with\\nthe same marginals, but no correlations. Finally, we discuss how these\\nensembles provide a model for Hawking radiation assuming unitary evolution, and\\ndiscuss some of their properties in relations to the Page curve of Hawking\\nradiation.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.stat-mech,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T17:03:29Z\"}"}
