We\\npresent two novel results and one known, but frequently ignored property of\\nsuch matter. The first new feature is the appearance, in the deep inner crust,\\nof an extensive and almost pure $^{14}$He layer that extends up to the density\\nof the transition to homogeneous matter. This layer may challenge the idea of\\nnuclear pasta phases, significantly impact the transport properties and the\\ncrust crystallization process. Second, we raise the question of the\\n(in)stability of the inner crust with respect to diffusion of ions (buoyancy)\\nand demonstrate that our crust is stable, in contrast with the predictions of\\nsome other models. Finally, we show that subsaturated stellar matter is\\nthermodynamically stable with respect to density fluctuations, which rules out\\na first-order phase transition between inhomogeneous and homogeneous phases.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T12:21:46Z\"}"}
