{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02470v1\", \"title\": \"Impact of Global Warming on Extreme Rainfall in Taiwan\", \"summary\": \"The relationship between global warming and extreme rainfalls in Taiwan was\\nexamined in this study. Taiwan rainfall data from TCCIP, a project led by MOST,\\nwere analyzed. North Hemisphere reference temperature data from NCEI led by\\nNOAA. The yearly maximum of daily rainfall was focused on and the PGEV model,\\nas proposed by Olafsdottir et al. \\\\citep{olafsdottir2021extreme}, was used to\\nfit the extreme values and make inferences. The PGEV model integrates the\\nGeneral Extreme Value (GEV) and Peak over Threshold (PoT) approaches, which are\\ncommonly used to analyze extreme data. Relative intensity and return value were\\nused to show the connection between temperature and extreme rainfall.\\n  Results indicated that the intensity of extreme rainfall in Taiwan increases\\nas the temperature rises. However, the effects of global warming on the\\nfrequency and intensity of extreme rainfalls varied by region. In the north and\\nsouth regions, the frequency of extreme rainfalls changed, while in the center\\nand east regions, the intensity of extreme rainfalls changed. Furthermore,\\naccording to the return value analysis, extreme rainfalls are likely to occur\\nmore frequently in the future.\\n  To account for differences between locations, Gaussian Process was used to\\nsmooth the results obtained using the PGEV model. In addition, simulations\\nusing the Gaussian copula and Gaussian Process were conducted to determine the\\nquantile confidence intervals for each PGEV model. The simulations showed that\\nall tests comparing with models with and without covariates are significant.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T10:44:32Z\"}"}
