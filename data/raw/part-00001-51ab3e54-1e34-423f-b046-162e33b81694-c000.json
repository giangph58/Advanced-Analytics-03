Without the scattering\\npaths along magnetic domains, this phase transition is governed by scattering\\ninduced by nonmagnetic disorder. We show that the QAH phase is strikingly\\nrobust in the presence of spatially uncorrelated disorder. The robustness is\\nattributed to a resilience of the topological band gap against disorder,\\ninduced by quantum confinement. The critical behavior near the phase transition\\nsuggests that the scattering is distinct from quantum percolation. This\\nprovides new insights on the robustness of the QAH effect in magnetic\\ntopological insulators with atomic defects, impurities, and dopants.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T12:42:08Z\"}"}
