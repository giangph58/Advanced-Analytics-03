{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20702v1\", \"title\": \"Wavefront Shaping of Scattering Forces Enhances Optical Trapping of\\n  Levitated Nanoparticles\", \"summary\": \"Optically-levitated nanoparticles in vacuum offer a pristine platform for\\nhigh-quality mechanical oscillators, enabling a wide range of precision\\nmeasurements and quantum technologies. A key performance metric in such systems\\nis the stiffness of the optical trap, which is typically enhanced by increasing\\nlaser power-at the cost of unwanted heating, reduced coherence, and enhanced\\nquantum backaction. Here, we demonstrate a fundamentally new route to\\nincreasing trap stiffness: wavefront shaping of the optical field. By tailoring\\nthe spatial phase profile of the trapping beam, we significantly boost the\\nmechanical confinement of subwavelength particles without raising the optical\\nintensity. Remarkably, this enhancement arises from a selective reduction of\\nnon-conservative optical forces, while preserving the conservative restoring\\nforces that define trap stiffness. As a result, mechanical nonlinearities are\\nalso reduced, improving stability at low pressures. Our findings challenge the\\nlong-standing assumption that diffraction-limited focusing is optimal for\\ndipolar Rayleigh particles, and establish wavefront shaping as a powerful,\\nreadily applicable tool to control optomechanical forces in levitation\\nexperiments. This opens new avenues for minimizing backaction, reducing thermal\\ndecoherence, and expanding the range of materials that can be stably levitated.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T12:33:29Z\"}"}
