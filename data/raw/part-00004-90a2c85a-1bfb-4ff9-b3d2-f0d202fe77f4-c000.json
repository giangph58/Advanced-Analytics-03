As a result,\\ncontrary to other related approaches, system stability with the developed\\ncontroller does not rely on designing a terminal cost. A distributed synthesis\\napproach is then introduced to handle the stability constraint locally within\\neach local agent. To solve the underlying optimization problem for distributed\\nMPC, a violation-free distributed optimization approach is developed, using\\nconstraint tightening to ensure feasibility throughout iterations. A numerical\\nexample demonstrates that the proposed distributed MPC approach ensures\\nclosed-loop stability for each feasible control sequence, with each agent\\ncomputing its control input in parallel.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T10:25:36Z\"}"}
