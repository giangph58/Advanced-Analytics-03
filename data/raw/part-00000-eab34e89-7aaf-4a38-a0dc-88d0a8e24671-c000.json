{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05821v1\", \"title\": \"On the Hopf envelope of finite-dimensional bialgebras\", \"summary\": \"The Hopf envelope of a bialgebra is the free Hopf algebra generated by the\\ngiven bialgebra. Its existence, as well as that of the cofree Hopf algebra, is\\na well-known fact in Hopf algebra theory, but their construction is not\\nparticularly handy or friendly. In this note, we offer a novel realisation of\\nthe Hopf envelope and of the cofree Hopf algebra of a finite-dimensional\\nbialgebra as a particular quotient and sub-bialgebra, respectively, of the\\nbialgebra itself. Our construction can also be extended to the\\ninfinite-dimensional case, provided that the bialgebra satisfies additional\\nconditions, such as being left Artinian as an algebra or admitting a\\n$n$-antipode, the latter being a notion hereby introduced.\", \"main_category\": \"math.QA\", \"categories\": \"math.QA,math.CT,math.RA,math.RT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:02:14Z\"}"}
