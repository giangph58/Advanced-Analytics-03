Through comprehensive experimentation, we investigate\\nthe impact of various adversarial attack strategies on model performance\\nmetrics. Our findings, highlighting how prone those techniques are to simple\\nattacks, are alarming, and the inconsistency in the attacks' effect on\\ndifferent algorithms promises ways for attack mitigation. We examine the\\neffectiveness of different mitigation strategies, including adversarial\\ntraining and enhanced feature selection, in enhancing model robustness and show\\ntheir effectiveness.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:54:56Z\"}"}
