{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15035v1\", \"title\": \"SOLIDO: A Robust Watermarking Method for Speech Synthesis via Low-Rank\\n  Adaptation\", \"summary\": \"The accelerated advancement of speech generative models has given rise to\\nsecurity issues, including model infringement and unauthorized abuse of\\ncontent. Although existing generative watermarking techniques have proposed\\ncorresponding solutions, most methods require substantial computational\\noverhead and training costs. In addition, some methods have limitations in\\nrobustness when handling variable-length inputs. To tackle these challenges, we\\npropose \\\\textsc{SOLIDO}, a novel generative watermarking method that integrates\\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning with speech watermarking through low-rank\\nadaptation (LoRA) for speech diffusion models. Concretely, the watermark\\nencoder converts the watermark to align with the input of diffusion models. To\\nachieve precise watermark extraction from variable-length inputs, the watermark\\ndecoder based on depthwise separable convolution is designed for watermark\\nrecovery. To further enhance speech generation performance and watermark\\nextraction capability, we propose a speech-driven lightweight fine-tuning\\nstrategy, which reduces computational overhead through LoRA. Comprehensive\\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed method ensures high-fidelity\\nwatermarked speech even at a large capacity of 2000 bps. Furthermore, against\\ncommon individual and compound speech attacks, our SOLIDO achieves a maximum\\naverage extraction accuracy of 99.20\\\\% and 98.43\\\\%, respectively. It surpasses\\nother state-of-the-art methods by nearly 23\\\\% in resisting time-stretching\\nattacks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.AI,cs.SD\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T11:43:36Z\"}"}
