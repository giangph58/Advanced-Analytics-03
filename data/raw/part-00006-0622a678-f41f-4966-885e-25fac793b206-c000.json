By further adding hadron shells,\\nthe mass range of the whole stars spans from $2$ to $17$ solar masses, with the\\nmaximum compactness around $0.15$. This result allow them to be black hole\\nmimickers and candidates for gap events. The I-Love-Q-C relations are also\\nanalyzed, which show consistency with the neutron star cases when the\\ndiscontinuity at the quark-hadron interface is not large. Besides, we\\nillustrate the full parameter maps of the energy density and pressure as\\nfunctions of the temperature and chemical potential, and discuss the constant\\nthermal conductivity case supposing a heat source inside.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,astro-ph.HE,gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:48:34Z\"}"}
