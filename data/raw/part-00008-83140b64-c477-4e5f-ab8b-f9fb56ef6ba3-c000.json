Inspired by this fact and by how braids force the existence of\\ncomplex dynamics, in this paper we introduce three topological invariants that\\ndescribe the topology of period--doubling routes to chaos. As an application,\\nwe use our methods to ascribe symbolic dynamics to perturbations of the\\nShilnikov homoclinic scenario and to study the dynamics of the Henon map.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS,math.CV,math.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T09:13:46Z\"}"}
