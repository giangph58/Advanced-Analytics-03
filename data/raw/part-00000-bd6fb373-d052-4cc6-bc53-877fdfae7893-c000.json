{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21708v1\", \"title\": \"Elementwise Layer Normalization\", \"summary\": \"A recent paper proposed Dynamic Tanh (DyT) as a drop-in replacement for Layer\\nNormalization. Although the method is empirically well-motivated and appealing\\nfrom a practical point of view, it lacks a theoretical foundation. In this\\nwork, we derive DyT mathematically and show that a well-defined approximation\\nis needed to do so. By dropping said approximation, an alternative element-wise\\ntransformation is obtained, which we call Elementwise Layer Normalization\\n(ELN). We demonstrate that ELN resembles Layer Normalization more accurately\\nthan DyT does.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:20:44Z\"}"}
