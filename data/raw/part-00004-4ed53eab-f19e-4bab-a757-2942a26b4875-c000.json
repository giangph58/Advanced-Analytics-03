{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20838v1\", \"title\": \"Bitcoin, a DAO?\", \"summary\": \"This paper investigates whether Bitcoin can be regarded as a decentralized\\nautonomous organization (DAO), what insights it may offer for the broader DAO\\necosystem, and how Bitcoin governance can be improved. First, a quantitative\\nliterature analysis reveals that Bitcoin is increasingly overlooked in DAO\\nresearch, even though early works often classified it as a DAO. Next, the paper\\napplies a DAO viability framework - centering on collective intelligence,\\ndigital democracy, and adaptation - to examine Bitcoin's organizational and\\ngovernance mechanisms. Findings suggest that Bitcoin instantitates key DAO\\nprinciples by enabling open participation, and employing decentralized\\ndecision-making through Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), miner signaling,\\nand user-activated soft forks. However, this governance carries potential\\nrisks, including reduced clarity on who truly 'votes' due to the concentration\\nof economic power among large stakeholders. The paper concludes by highlighting\\nopportunities to refine Bitcoin's deliberation process and reflecting on\\nbroader implications for DAO design, such as the absence of a legal entity. In\\ndoing so, it underscores Bitcoin's continued relevance as an archetype for\\ndecentralized governance, offering important findings for future DAO\\nimplementations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY,cs.ET\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T15:01:03Z\"}"}
