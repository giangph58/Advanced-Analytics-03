In this paper, we introduce the analogous exponent for\\nmeasures. We shall prove the following results: The expansion exponent of a\\nmeasurable maps is equal to the minimum of the expansion exponent taken over\\nthe Borel probability measures. In particular, a map expands small distances\\n(in the sense of Reddy \\\\cite{r}) if and only if every Borel probability has\\npositive expansion exponent. Any nonatomic invariant measure with positive\\nexpansion exponent is positively expansive in the sense of \\\\cite{m}. For\\nergodic invariant measures, the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy is bounded below by\\nthe product of the expansion exponent and the measure upper capacity. As a\\nconsequence, any ergodic invariant measure with both positive upper capacity\\nand positive expansion exponent must have positive entropy.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T06:50:53Z\"}"}
