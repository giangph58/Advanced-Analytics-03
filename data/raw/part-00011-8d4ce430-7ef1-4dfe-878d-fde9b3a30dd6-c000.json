Using data from NuSTAR, Swift,\\nXMM-Newton, and Chandra observatories, we investigate changes in the pulsar's\\ntiming and spectral properties. After more than 20 years of continuous spin-up,\\nthe pulsar's spin period stabilized, marking the onset of spin equilibrium.\\nThis transition was accompanied by the emergence of a previously unobserved\\naccretion regime at $L_{\\\\rm bol} = (2.0_{-1.0}^{+2.3})\\\\times 10^{34}$ erg\\ns$^{-1}$, an order of magnitude lower than its earlier quiescent state. After\\nthat, the source occasionally switched between these regimes, remaining in each\\nstate for extended periods, with the transition time from a luminosity of\\n$10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to $10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$ taking less than 2.3 day. The\\nanalysis of the spectral data collected during this new low-luminosity state\\nrevealed a two-hump shape which is different from the cutoff power-law spectra\\nobserved at higher luminosities. The discovery of pulsations in this state,\\ntogether with the hard spectral shape, demonstrates ongoing accretion. We\\nestimate the magnetic field strength to be $\\\\sim 10^{13}$ G based on indirect\\nmethods. Additionally, we report a hint of a previously undetected $\\\\sim$90-day\\norbital period in the system.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:04:03Z\"}"}
