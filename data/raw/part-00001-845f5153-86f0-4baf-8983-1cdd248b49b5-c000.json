To\\naddress this critical limitation, we explore the impact of reintegrating\\nexperimental feedback into the model design process. We propose a\\nlikelihood-based reintegration scheme, which we test through extensive\\ncomputational experiments on both RNA and protein datasets, as well as through\\nwet-lab experiments on the self-splicing ribozyme from the group I intron RNA\\nfamily where our approach demonstrates particular efficacy. We show that\\nintegrating recent experimental data enhances the model's capacity of\\ngenerating functional sequences (e.g. from 6.7\\\\% to 63.7\\\\% of active designs at\\n45 mutations). This feedback-driven approach thus provides a significant\\nimprovement in the design of biomolecular sequences by directly tackling the\\nfalse-positive challenge.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.BM\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.BM,physics.bio-ph,q-bio.QM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T10:57:53Z\"}"}
