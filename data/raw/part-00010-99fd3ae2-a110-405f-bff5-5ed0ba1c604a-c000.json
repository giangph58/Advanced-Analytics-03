{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19651v1\", \"title\": \"Fooling the Decoder: An Adversarial Attack on Quantum Error Correction\", \"summary\": \"Neural network decoders are becoming essential for achieving fault-tolerant\\nquantum computations. However, their internal mechanisms are poorly understood,\\nhindering our ability to ensure their reliability and security against\\nadversarial attacks. Leading machine learning decoders utilize recurrent and\\ntransformer models (e.g., AlphaQubit), with reinforcement learning (RL) playing\\na key role in training advanced transformer models (e.g., DeepSeek R1). In this\\nwork, we target a basic RL surface code decoder (DeepQ) to create the first\\nadversarial attack on quantum error correction. By applying state-of-the-art\\nwhite-box methods, we uncover vulnerabilities in this decoder, demonstrating an\\nattack that reduces the logical qubit lifetime in memory experiments by up to\\nfive orders of magnitude. We validate that this attack exploits a genuine\\nweakness, as the decoder exhibits robustness against noise fluctuations, is\\nlargely unaffected by substituting the referee decoder, responsible for episode\\ntermination, with an MWPM decoder, and demonstrates fault tolerance at\\ncheckable code distances. This attack highlights the susceptibility of machine\\nlearning-based QEC and underscores the importance of further research into\\nrobust QEC methods.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T10:10:05Z\"}"}
