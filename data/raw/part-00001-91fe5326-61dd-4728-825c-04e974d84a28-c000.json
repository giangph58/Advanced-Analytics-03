Our\\nfindings are compatible with a dissociative multiphoton-ionization mechanism\\nproducing a variety of ionic photofragments. Using both Stark deflection and\\nchemical separation of the two isomers, pronounced isomer-specific\\nphotofragmentation dynamics could be observed for different product channels.\\nWhile for Br+ formation, the isomer specificity appears to originate from\\ndifferent photoexcitation efficiencies, for the C2H2Br+ channel it is more\\nlikely caused by differences in the coupling to the exit channel. By contrast,\\nthe formation of the C2H2+ photofragment does not seem to exhibit a pronounced\\nisomeric dependence under the present conditions. The present work underlines\\nthe importance of isomeric effects in photochemistry even in small polyatomics\\nlike the present system as well as their pronounced dependence on the\\nphotoexcitation conditions.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T08:43:38Z\"}"}
