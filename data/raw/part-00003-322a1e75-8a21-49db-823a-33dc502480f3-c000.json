HCEs offer several\\nkey advantages, including increased statistical power, the mitigation of\\ncompeting risks, and hierarchical weighting of clinical importance for\\ndifferent outcome components. While, as summary measures, the win ratio (WR)\\nalong with the Net Benefit (NB) and the Win Odds (WO) provide a structured\\napproach to analyzing HCEs, several concerns regarding their interpretability\\nremain. In this paper, we explore critical aspects of WR interpretation that\\nhave received limited attention. Specifically, we discuss the challenge of\\ndefining an appropriate estimand in the context of HCEs using the WR, the\\ndifficulties in formulating a relevant causal question underlying the WR, and\\nthe dependency of the WR on the variance of its components, which complicates\\nits role as an effect measure. Additionally, we highlight the\\nnon-collapsibility of the WR, akin to hazard and odds ratios, further\\ncomplicating its interpretation. While the WR remains a valuable tool in\\nclinical trials, its inherent limitations must be acknowledged to ensure its\\nappropriate application and interpretation in regulatory and clinical\\ndecision-making.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T11:06:05Z\"}"}
