We derive the equations of motion for the\\nnull geodesics and analyze their properties, including the gravitational\\nlensing effect. The 3D and equatorial plane orbits are discussed, with\\nparticular attention given to the effect of quintessence. The deviations from\\nthe Ernst black hole provide insights into the potential observational\\nconsequences of dark energy in strong gravitational fields.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T10:24:54Z\"}"}
