These codes\\nefficiently simulate the progression of SAs, while they still have inherent\\nlimitations due to their inconsistent finite difference schemes. The use of\\nempirical schemes incorporating both implicit and explicit formulations\\ninherently induces unidirectional coupling in multi-physics analyses. The\\nobjective of this study is to develop a novel numerical method for TH system\\ncodes using physics-informed neural network (PINN). They have shown strength in\\nsolving multi-physics due to the innate feature of neural networks-automatic\\ndifferentiation. We propose a node-assigned PINN (NA-PINN) that is suitable for\\nthe control volume approach-based system codes. NA-PINN addresses the issue of\\nspatial governing equation variation by assigning an individual network to each\\nnodalization of the system code, such that spatial information is excluded from\\nboth the input and output domains, and each subnetwork learns to approximate a\\npurely temporal solution. In this phase, we evaluated the accuracy of the PINN\\nmethods for the hydrodynamic module. In the 6 water tank simulation, PINN and\\nNA-PINN showed maximum absolute errors of 1.678 and 0.007, respectively. It\\nshould be noted that only NA-PINN demonstrated acceptable accuracy. To the best\\nof the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to successfully implement a\\nsystem code using PINN. Our future work involves extending NA-PINN to a\\nmulti-physics solver and developing it in a surrogate manner.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T06:17:04Z\"}"}
