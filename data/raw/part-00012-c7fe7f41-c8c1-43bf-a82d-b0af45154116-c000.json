As\\nhardware continues to improve, there is a growing need to identify potential\\napplications on noisy quantum devices that can leverage these enhancements.\\nWith this motivation, we explore the advantages of shallow measurements over\\n(non-entangling) single-qubit measurements for learning various properties of a\\nquantum state. While previous studies have examined this subject, they have\\nprimarily focused on specific problems. Here, by developing a new theoretical\\nframework, we demonstrate how shallow measurements can benefit in diverse\\nscenarios. Despite the additional errors from two-qubit gates in shallow\\nmeasurements, we experimentally validated improvements compared to single-qubit\\nmeasurements in applications like derandomization, common randomized\\nmeasurements, and machine learning up to 40 qubits and 46 layers of two-qubit\\ngates, respectively. As a result, we show that hardware improvements, even\\nbefore QEC, could broaden the range of feasible applications.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T08:33:36Z\"}"}
