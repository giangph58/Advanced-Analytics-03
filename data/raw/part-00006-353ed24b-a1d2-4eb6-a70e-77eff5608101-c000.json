By using a structured dataset of 1,171\\npatients, four machine learning models Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting,\\nRandom Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks are applied to predict five-year\\nhospitalization risk, with the Gradient Boosting model achieving the highest\\naccuracy of 81.2%. The result demonstrated that patients with high medication\\nadherence and consistent preventive care can reduce 38.3% and 37.7% in\\nhospitalization risk. The finding also suggests that targeted preventive care\\ncan have positive Return on Investment (ROI), and therefore ML models can\\neffectively direct personalized interventions and contribute to long-term\\nmedical savings.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T03:28:42Z\"}"}
