We give an impossibility\\nproof that the W state cannot be used as the sharing state to realize the\\nperfect quantum teleportation for transmitting an arbitrary 1-qubit state, in\\nsharp contrast with the GHZ state which is well known to realize the perfect\\nquantum transportation. Moreover, we give a procedure of obtaining a modified\\nentangled state which we call the W-like state to achieve the perfect quantum\\ntransportation under a prescribed measurement basis.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T12:47:54Z\"}"}
