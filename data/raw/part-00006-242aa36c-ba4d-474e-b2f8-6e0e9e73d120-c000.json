{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15746v1\", \"title\": \"Enhancing Tennis Training with Real-Time Swing Data Visualisation in\\n  Immersive Virtual Reality\", \"summary\": \"Recent advances in immersive technology have opened new possibilities in\\nsports training, especially for activities requiring precise motor skills, such\\nas tennis. In this paper, we present a virtual reality (VR) tennis training\\nsystem integrating real-time performance feedback through a wearable sensor\\ndevice. Ten participants wore the sensor on their dominant hand to capture\\nmotion data, including swing speed and swing power, while engaging in a VR\\ntennis environment. Initially, participants performed baseline tests without\\naccess to performance metrics. In subsequent tests, participants executed\\nsimilar routines with their swing data displayed in real-time via a VR overlay.\\nQualitative and quantitative results indicated that real-time visual feedback\\nled to improved performance behaviors and enhanced situational awareness. Some\\nparticipants exhibited increased swing consistency and strategic\\ndecision-making, though improvements in accuracy varied individually.\\nAdditionally, subjective feedback highlighted that the immersive experience,\\ncombined with instantaneous performance metrics, enhanced player engagement and\\nmotivation. These findings illustrate the effectiveness of VR-based data\\nvisualisation in sports training, suggesting broader applicability in\\nperformance enhancement.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T09:48:40Z\"}"}
