{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05686v1\", \"title\": \"kNN-SVC: Robust Zero-Shot Singing Voice Conversion with Additive\\n  Synthesis and Concatenation Smoothness Optimization\", \"summary\": \"Robustness is critical in zero-shot singing voice conversion (SVC). This\\npaper introduces two novel methods to strengthen the robustness of the kNN-VC\\nframework for SVC. First, kNN-VC's core representation, WavLM, lacks harmonic\\nemphasis, resulting in dull sounds and ringing artifacts. To address this, we\\nleverage the bijection between WavLM, pitch contours, and spectrograms to\\nperform additive synthesis, integrating the resulting waveform into the model\\nto mitigate these issues. Second, kNN-VC overlooks concatenative smoothness, a\\nkey perceptual factor in SVC. To enhance smoothness, we propose a new distance\\nmetric that filters out unsuitable kNN candidates and optimize the summing\\nweights of the candidates during inference. Although our techniques are built\\non the kNN-VC framework for implementation convenience, they are broadly\\napplicable to general concatenative neural synthesis models. Experimental\\nresults validate the effectiveness of these modifications in achieving robust\\nSVC.
