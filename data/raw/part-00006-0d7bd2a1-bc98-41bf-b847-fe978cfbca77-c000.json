We show that energy diffusion is faster at weak random\\nfields but becomes essentially equal at strong fields; hence, both diffusions\\ndetermine the slowest relaxation time scale (Thouless time) in the system.\\nNumerically reachable finite-size systems reveal the anomalously large\\ndistribution of diffusion constants with respect to actual field\\nconfigurations. Despite the exponential-like dependence of diffusion on field\\nstrength, results for the sensitivity to twisted boundary conditions are\\nincompatible with the Thouless criterion for localization and the presumable\\ntransition to MBL, at least for numerically reachable sizes. In contrast, we\\nfind indications for the scenario of subdiffusive transport, in particular in\\nthe dynamical diffusivity response.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T08:47:17Z\"}"}
