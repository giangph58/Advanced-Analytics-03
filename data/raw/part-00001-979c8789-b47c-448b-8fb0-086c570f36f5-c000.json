As the country moves toward BVD freedom, the\\ndevelopment of predictive models for targeted surveillance becomes increasingly\\nimportant to mitigate the risk of disease re-emergence. In this study, we\\nevaluate the performance of a range of machine learning algorithms, including\\nbinary classification and anomaly detection techniques, for predicting\\nBVD-positive herds using highly imbalanced herd-level data. We conduct an\\nextensive simulation study to assess model performance across varying sample\\nsizes and class imbalance ratios, incorporating resampling, class weighting,\\nand appropriate evaluation metrics (sensitivity, positive predictive value,\\nF1-score and AUC values). Random forests and XGBoost models consistently\\noutperformed other methods, with the random forest model achieving the highest\\nsensitivity and AUC across scenarios, including real-world prediction of 2023\\nherd status, correctly identifying 219 of 250 positive herds while halving the\\nnumber of herds that require compared to a blanket-testing strategy.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:33:15Z\"}"}
