We fine-tuned foundation models using the Open FinLLM\\nLeaderboard as a benchmark. Building on Qwen2.5 and Deepseek-R1, we employed\\ntechniques including supervised fine-tuning (SFT), direct preference\\noptimization (DPO), and reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their financial\\ncapabilities. The fine-tuned models demonstrated substantial performance gains\\nacross a wide range of financial tasks. Moreover, we measured the data scaling\\nlaw in the financial domain. Our work demonstrates the potential of large\\nlanguage models (LLMs) in financial applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:42:02Z\"}"}
