{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15257v1\", \"title\": \"FlowReasoner: Reinforcing Query-Level Meta-Agents\", \"summary\": \"This paper proposes a query-level meta-agent named FlowReasoner to automate\\nthe design of query-level multi-agent systems, i.e., one system per user query.\\nOur core idea is to incentivize a reasoning-based meta-agent via external\\nexecution feedback. Concretely, by distilling DeepSeek R1, we first endow the\\nbasic reasoning ability regarding the generation of multi-agent systems to\\nFlowReasoner. Then, we further enhance it via reinforcement learning (RL) with\\nexternal execution feedback. A multi-purpose reward is designed to guide the RL\\ntraining from aspects of performance, complexity, and efficiency. In this\\nmanner, FlowReasoner is enabled to generate a personalized multi-agent system\\nfor each user query via deliberative reasoning. Experiments on both engineering\\nand competition code benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of FlowReasoner.\\nRemarkably, it surpasses o1-mini by 10.52% accuracy across three benchmarks.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/FlowReasoner.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T17:35:42Z\"}"}
