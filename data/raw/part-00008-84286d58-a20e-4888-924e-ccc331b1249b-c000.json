To this end, we employ the Kohn variational principle\\nformulated in the discrete basis formalism. We apply this to one-dimensional\\nscattering problems with a Gaussian barrier. Both for a single-channel and\\ntwo-channel problems, we demonstrate that the penetration probability as well\\nas the wave functions are well reproduced by the emulator. In particular, the\\nenergy dependence of the penetrability in a wider range of energy from well\\nbelow the barrier to well above the barrier is successfully reproduced.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T07:41:59Z\"}"}
