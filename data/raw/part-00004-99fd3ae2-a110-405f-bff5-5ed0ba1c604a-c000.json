{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19645v1\", \"title\": \"A Comprehensive Part-of-Speech Tagging to Standardize Central-Kurdish\\n  Language: A Research Guide for Kurdish Natural Language Processing Tasks\", \"summary\": \"- The field of natural language processing (NLP) has dramatically expanded\\nwithin the last decade. Many human-being applications are conducted daily via\\nNLP tasks, starting from machine translation, speech recognition, text\\ngeneration and recommendations, Part-of-Speech tagging (POS), and Named-Entity\\nRecognition (NER). However, low-resourced languages, such as the\\nCentral-Kurdish language (CKL), mainly remain unexamined due to shortage of\\nnecessary resources to support their development. The POS tagging task is the\\nbase of other NLP tasks; for example, the POS tag set has been used to\\nstandardized languages to provide the relationship between words among the\\nsentences, followed by machine translation and text recommendation.\\nSpecifically, for the CKL, most of the utilized or provided POS tagsets are\\nneither standardized nor comprehensive. To this end, this study presented an\\naccurate and comprehensive POS tagset for the CKL to provide better performance\\nof the Kurdish NLP tasks. The article also collected most of the POS tags from\\ndifferent studies as well as from Kurdish linguistic experts to standardized\\npart-of-speech tags. The proposed POS tagset is designed to annotate a large\\nCKL corpus and support Kurdish NLP tasks. The initial investigations of this\\nstudy via comparison with the Universal Dependencies framework for standard\\nlanguages, show that the proposed POS tagset can streamline or correct\\nsentences more accurately for Kurdish NLP tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T10:02:11Z\"}"}
