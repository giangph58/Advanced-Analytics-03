On synthetic 2D data (linearly separable\\nand moon-shaped) using logistic regression and MLPs, we observe that weighting\\nstrongly affects decision boundaries early in training but fades with prolonged\\noptimization. On CIFAR-10 with various class imbalances, only L2 regularization\\n(not dropout) helps preserve weighting effects. In a covariate-shift\\nexperiment, importance weighting yields no significant performance gain,\\nhighlighting challenges on complex data. Our results call into question the\\npractical utility of importance weighting for real-world distribution shifts.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:16:38Z\"}"}
