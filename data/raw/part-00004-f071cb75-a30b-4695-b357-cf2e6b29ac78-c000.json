A. L. Almeida, Phys. Rev.\\nLett. 131 (2023) 268101], which is a physical candidate to self-generate\\ncritical clusters in the percolation universality class. Here we present\\nexperimental evidence that large clusters and their hulls are indeed both\\nfractals with dimensions of the corresponding figures in critical percolation\\nmodels. The asymptotic decay of a crossing probability, from a region in the\\nvicinity of the origin to the boundary of disks, is described by the\\nLawler-Schramm-Werner theorem provided that a microscopic length in the\\noriginal formulation is replaced by the coarsening length of the liquid\\ncrystal. Furthermore, the behavior for the winding angle of large loops is, at\\ncertain scales, compatible with that of Schramm-Loewner evolution curves with\\ndiffusivity $\\\\kappa = 6$. These results show an experimental realization of\\ncritical clusters in phase ordering.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:02:37Z\"}"}
