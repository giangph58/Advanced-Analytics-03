We find that the states of the barrier particle\\nafter the tunneling or reflection of the projectile are displaced by a finite\\ndistance that is given by the derivative of the phase of the transmission or\\nreflection amplitudes multiplied by factors dependent on particles' masses,\\nrespectively. We demonstrate these results on a numerical example with a\\nresonant interaction between a projectile and barrier. Our work demonstrates\\nphysical implication of the concept of phase time delay in the form of finite\\ndisplacements of particles that are, in principle, experimentally measurable.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T09:53:32Z\"}"}
