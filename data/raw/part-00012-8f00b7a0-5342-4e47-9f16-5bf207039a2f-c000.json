{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02288v1\", \"title\": \"FEASE: Shallow AutoEncoding Recommender with Cold Start Handling via\\n  Side Features\", \"summary\": \"User and item cold starts present significant challenges in industrial\\napplications of recommendation systems. Supplementing user-item interaction\\ndata with metadata is a common solution-but often at the cost of introducing\\nadditional biases. In this work, we introduce an augmented EASE model, i.e.\\nFEASE, that seamlessly integrates both user and item side information to\\naddress these cold start issues. Our straightforward, autoencoder-based method\\nproduces a closed-form solution that leverages rich content signals for cold\\nitems while refining user representations in data-sparse environments.\\nImportantly, our method strikes a balance by effectively recommending cold\\nstart items and handling cold start users without incurring extra bias, and it\\nmaintains strong performance in warm settings. Experimental results demonstrate\\nimproved recommendation accuracy and robustness compared to previous\\ncollaborative filtering approaches. Moreover, our model serves as a strong\\nbaseline for future comparative studies.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T05:27:55Z\"}"}
