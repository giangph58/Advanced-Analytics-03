{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00635v1\", \"title\": \"SOMA: a novel sampler for exchangeable variables\", \"summary\": \"The problem of sampling exchangeable random variables arises in many Bayesian\\ninference tasks, especially in data imputation given a privatized summary\\nstatistics. These permutation-invariant joint distributions often have\\ndependency structures that make sampling challenging. Component-wise sampling\\nstrategies, such as Metropolis-within-Gibbs, can mix slowly because they\\nconsider only comparing a proposed point with one component at a time. In this\\nwork, we propose a novel Single-Offer-Multiple-Attempts (SOMA) sampler that is\\ntailored to sampling permutation invariant distributions. The core intuition of\\nSOMA is that a proposed point unsuitable to replace one component might still\\nbe a good candidate to replace some other component in the joint distribution.\\nSOMA first makes a singer offer, and then simultaneously considers attempts to\\nreplace each component of the current state with the single offer, before\\nmaking the final acceptance or rejection decision. We provide an acceptance\\nlower bound of SOMA and, using a coupling method, derive the convergence rate\\nupper bound of SOMA in the two-dimensional case. We validate theoretical\\nfindings with numerical simulations, including a demonstration on\\ndifferentially private Bayesian linear regression.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T16:20:16Z\"}"}
