One of the key\\nchallenges of this problem is the user's stochastic watch-time behavior. To\\nimprove the prediction accuracy for such an uncertain behavior, existing\\napproaches show that one can either reduce the noise through duration bias\\nmodeling or formulate a distribution modeling task to capture the uncertainty.\\nHowever, the uncontrolled uncertainty is not always equally distributed across\\nusers and videos, inducing a balancing paradox between the model accuracy and\\nthe ability to capture out-of-distribution samples. In practice, we find that\\nthe uncertainty of the watch-time prediction model also provides key\\ninformation about user behavior, which, in turn, could benefit the prediction\\ntask itself. Following this notion, we derive an explicit uncertainty modeling\\nstrategy for the prediction model and propose an adversarial optimization\\nframework that can better exploit the user watch-time behavior. This framework\\nhas been deployed online on an industrial video sharing platform that serves\\nhundreds of millions of daily active users, which obtains a significant\\nincrease in users' video watch time by 0.31% through the online A/B test.\\nFurthermore, extended offline experiments on two public datasets verify the\\neffectiveness of the proposed framework across various watch-time prediction\\nbackbones.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T09:19:19Z\"}"}
