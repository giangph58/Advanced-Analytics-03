{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09998v1\", \"title\": \"Metric-Guided Synthesis of Class Activation Mapping\", \"summary\": \"Class activation mapping (CAM) is a widely adopted class of saliency methods\\nused to explain the behavior of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These\\nmethods generate heatmaps that highlight the parts of the input most relevant\\nto the CNN output. Various CAM methods have been proposed, each distinguished\\nby the expressions used to derive heatmaps. In general, users look for heatmaps\\nwith specific properties that reflect different aspects of CNN functionality.\\nThese may include similarity to ground truth, robustness, equivariance, and\\nmore. Although existing CAM methods implicitly encode some of these properties\\nin their expressions, they do not allow for variability in heatmap generation\\nfollowing the user's intent or domain knowledge. In this paper, we address this\\nlimitation by introducing SyCAM, a metric-based approach for synthesizing CAM\\nexpressions. Given a predefined evaluation metric for saliency maps, SyCAM\\nautomatically generates CAM expressions optimized for that metric. We\\nspecifically explore a syntax-guided synthesis instantiation of SyCAM, where\\nCAM expressions are derived based on predefined syntactic constraints and the\\ngiven metric. Using several established evaluation metrics, we demonstrate the\\nefficacy and flexibility of our approach in generating targeted heatmaps. We\\ncompare SyCAM with other well-known CAM methods on three prominent models:\\nResNet50, VGG16, and VGG19.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:01:49Z\"}"}
