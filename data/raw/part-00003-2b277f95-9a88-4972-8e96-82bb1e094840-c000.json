In this work, we first empirically demonstrate the instability and\\nsuboptimal performance of existing popular MU methods when deployed in\\ndifferent scenarios. To address this issue, we propose Dual Optimizer\\n(DualOptim), which incorporates adaptive learning rate and decoupled momentum\\nfactors. Empirical and theoretical evidence demonstrates that DualOptim\\ncontributes to effective and stable unlearning. Through extensive experiments,\\nwe show that DualOptim can significantly boost MU efficacy and stability across\\ndiverse tasks, including image classification, image generation, and large\\nlanguage models, making it a versatile approach to empower existing MU\\nalgorithms.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T12:18:26Z\"}"}
