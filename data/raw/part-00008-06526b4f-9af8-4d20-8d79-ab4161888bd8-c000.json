Analyses\\nexploring the price of hydrogen usually calculate average or marginal\\nproduction costs regardless of the time of delivery. A key factor that affects\\nthe price of hydrogen is the balancing costs, which we define as the expense of\\nensuring a steady schedule of hydrogen delivery. We explore the effect of\\ndelivering hydrogen to the export ports at different schedules, ranging from\\nfully flexible to moderately stable with a daily and weekly buffer, to fully\\nstable. We quantify the rise in hydrogen price with strict balancing constraint\\nin three countries: Brazil, Morocco and Turkey, and three export volumes: 10,\\n50 and 200 TWh. The price difference between the flexible and stable schedules\\nwas found to reach a maximum of 36% in Brazil, 47% in Morocco and 18% in Turkey\\nacross the different export volumes.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:25:59Z\"}"}
