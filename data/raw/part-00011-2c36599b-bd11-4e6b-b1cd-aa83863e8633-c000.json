This coupling vanishes as the\\nmass approaches zero. By utilizing the argument principle in complex analysis,\\nwe determine the existence condition for collective modes and find the onset\\ntransition behavior of collective modes previously observed in massless\\nsystems. We numerically determine the critical wavenumber for the existence of\\neach mode under various values of the scaled mass. Within the range of scaled\\nmasses considered, the critical wavenumbers for the heat and shear channels\\ndecrease with increasing scaled mass, while that of the sound channel exhibits\\na non-monotonic dependence on the scaled mass. In addition, we analytically\\nderive the dispersion relations for these collective modes in the\\nlong-wavelength limit. Notably, kinetic theory also incorporates collisionless\\ndissipation effects, known as Landau damping. We find that the branch cut\\nstructure responsible for Landau damping differs significantly from the\\nmassless case: whereas the massless system features only two branch points, the\\nmassive system exhibits an infinite number of such points forming a continuous\\nbranch cut.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,cond-mat.stat-mech,hep-th,nucl-th,physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:14:15Z\"}"}
