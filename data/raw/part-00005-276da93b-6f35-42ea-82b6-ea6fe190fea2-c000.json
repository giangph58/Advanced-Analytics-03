However, there is still a demand for effective\\nand efficient methods to co-design LA dashboards and indicators. Indicator\\nSpecification Cards (ISCs) have been introduced recently to facilitate the\\nsystematic co-design of indicators by different LA stakeholders. In this paper,\\nwe strive to enhance the user experience and usefulness of the ISC-based\\nindicator design process. Towards this end, we present the systematic design,\\nimplementation, and evaluation details of the ISC Creator, an interactive LA\\ntool that allows low-cost and flexible design of LA indicators. Our findings\\ndemonstrate the importance of carefully considered interactivity and\\nrecommendations for orienting and supporting non-expert LA stakeholders to\\ndesign custom LA indicators.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:49:47Z\"}"}
