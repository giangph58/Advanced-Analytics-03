{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06559v1\", \"title\": \"TabKAN: Advancing Tabular Data Analysis using Kolmograv-Arnold Network\", \"summary\": \"Tabular data analysis presents unique challenges due to its heterogeneous\\nfeature types, missing values, and complex interactions. While traditional\\nmachine learning methods, such as gradient boosting, often outperform deep\\nlearning approaches, recent advancements in neural architectures offer\\npromising alternatives. This paper introduces TabKAN, a novel framework that\\nadvances tabular data modeling using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). Unlike\\nconventional deep learning models, KANs leverage learnable activation functions\\non edges, enhancing both interpretability and training efficiency. Our\\ncontributions include: (1) the introduction of modular KAN-based architectures\\ntailored for tabular data analysis, (2) the development of a transfer learning\\nframework for KAN models, enabling effective knowledge transfer between\\ndomains, (3) the development of model-specific interpretability for tabular\\ndata learning, reducing reliance on post hoc and model-agnostic analysis, and\\n(4) comprehensive evaluation of vanilla supervised learning across binary and\\nmulti-class classification tasks. Through extensive benchmarking on diverse\\npublic datasets, TabKAN demonstrates superior performance in supervised\\nlearning while significantly outperforming classical and Transformer-based\\nmodels in transfer learning scenarios. Our findings highlight the advantage of\\nKAN-based architectures in efficiently transferring knowledge across domains,\\nbridging the gap between traditional machine learning and deep learning for\\nstructured data.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T03:46:10Z\"}"}
