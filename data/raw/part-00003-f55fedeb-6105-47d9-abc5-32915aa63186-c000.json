It is well established already that optical losses in HCFs are highly\\nsensitive to both the wavelength and the geometry of the cladding capillaries.\\nThe underlying physical mechanisms behind reducing loss with the change of HCF\\ndesign parameters while keeping the same fiber structure are not yet fully\\nunderstood. In this work, we investigate the relationship between light\\nlocalization and corresponding decrease of losses in HCFs and the distribution\\nof reverse energy fluxes in air-core modes. We show here that the shape of the\\ncapillaries plays a crucial role in controlling radial energy backflows that\\ninfluence light confinement and the energy leakage from air-core modes of HCFs.\\nThrough numerical modeling, we demonstrate that optimizing the capillary\\ngeometry to tailor the distribution of reverse radial energy fluxes leads to a\\nsubstantial reduction in transmission losses even in fibers with relatively\\nsimple cladding structures. Consideration of the energy flows and observed\\noccurrences of vortex of the Poynting vector allows us to a draw an interesting\\ninterdisciplinary analogy with the hydrodynamical system with suppressed\\nbackward flow - Tesla valve. We believe that combination of singular optics and\\nenergy fluxes analysis provides valuable physical insight into the mechanisms\\ngoverning waveguiding in HCFs offering a pathway toward novel designs with\\nminimized leakage loss.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:44:23Z\"}"}
