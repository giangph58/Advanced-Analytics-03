Here, we demonstrate a photoelectron interferometric approach to\\naccess the phase of the photoelectron wavepacket and uncover attosecond\\ndynamics in chiral molecule photoionization. Using circularly polarized\\nattosecond XUV pulse trains synchronized with IR fields, we reveal distinct\\ntime delays between forward- and backward-ejected photoelectrons in a randomly\\noriented ensemble of chiral molecules. Moreover, we predict a pronounced\\nenhancement of PECD due to the interference of the two photoionization\\npathways. The forward-backward time delay difference and the PECD are more\\nprominent when the IR field counter-rotates with the XUV field. These results\\nimply the counter-rotating IR field is more efficient in generating odd-parity\\nphotoelectron wavepackets in continuum-continuum transitions, highlighting the\\ncritical role of long-range chiral potential. Our work demonstrates a way of\\ncoherent control over the chiral photoelectron wavepackets, providing a route\\nto enhance chiral signals and manipulate ultrafast chiral dynamics on\\nattosecond time scales.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T14:30:30Z\"}"}
