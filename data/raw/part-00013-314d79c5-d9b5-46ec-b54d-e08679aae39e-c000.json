We introduce a novel time-dependent\\nparametrization for the bulk viscosity coefficient, given by \\\\(\\\\zeta = \\\\zeta_0\\n(t - t_0)^{-2n} \\\\rho^{1/2}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\zeta_0\\\\), \\\\(t_0\\\\), and \\\\(n\\\\) are model\\nparameters. This formulation is designed to investigate whether bulk viscosity\\nof this nature can effectively describe the evolution of the universe,\\nparticularly in scenarios that avoid initial singularities through a\\ncosmological bounce. Remarkably, the general solutions emerging from our model\\nexhibit significant flexibility, accommodating not only a bouncing universe but\\nalso an early inflationary phase and a late-time acceleration mimicking dark\\nenergy. The roles of \\\\(\\\\zeta_0\\\\), \\\\(t_0\\\\), and \\\\(n\\\\) are pivotal, as they\\ngovern the cosmic evolution and determine the transitions between different\\nphases. To validate the robustness of our model, we analyze key cosmological\\nquantities such as the energy density, deceleration parameter, and the validity\\nof various energy conditions. Furthermore, we employ statefinder diagnostics to\\nprobe the dark energy behavior and examine Hubble flow parameters to shed light\\non the inflationary aspects of the model. Lastly, we confront our theoretical\\npredictions with observational data sets, including the BAO, DESI and\\nPantheon+SH0ES datasets, demonstrating the model's consistency with empirical\\ncosmological trends.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T11:38:10Z\"}"}
