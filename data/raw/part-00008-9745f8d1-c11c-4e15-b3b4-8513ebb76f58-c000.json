{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12771v1\", \"title\": \"Classification-Based Analysis of Price Pattern Differences Between\\n  Cryptocurrencies and Stocks\", \"summary\": \"Cryptocurrencies are digital tokens built on blockchain technology, with\\nthousands actively traded on centralized exchanges (CEXs). Unlike stocks, which\\nare backed by real businesses, cryptocurrencies are recognized as a distinct\\nclass of assets by researchers. How do investors treat this new category of\\nasset in trading? Are they similar to stocks as an investment tool for\\ninvestors? We answer these questions by investigating cryptocurrencies' and\\nstocks' price time series which can reflect investors' attitudes towards the\\ntargeted assets. Concretely, we use different machine learning models to\\nclassify cryptocurrencies' and stocks' price time series in the same period and\\nget an extremely high accuracy rate, which reflects that cryptocurrency\\ninvestors behave differently in trading from stock investors. We then extract\\nfeatures from these price time series to explain the price pattern difference,\\nincluding mean, variance, maximum, minimum, kurtosis, skewness, and first to\\nthird-order autocorrelation, etc., and then use machine learning methods\\nincluding logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), support vector machine\\n(SVM), etc. for classification. The classification results show that these\\nextracted features can help to explain the price time series pattern difference\\nbetween cryptocurrencies and stocks.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.ST\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.ST\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T09:12:27Z\"}"}
