{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11440v1\", \"title\": \"Greedy Restart Schedules: A Baseline for Dynamic Algorithm Selection on\\n  Numerical Black-box Optimization Problems\", \"summary\": \"In many optimization domains, there are multiple different solvers that\\ncontribute to the overall state-of-the-art, each performing better on some, and\\nworse on other types of problem instances. Meta-algorithmic approaches, such as\\ninstance-based algorithm selection, configuration and scheduling, aim to close\\nthis gap by extracting the most performance possible from a set of\\n(configurable) optimizers. In this context, the best performing individual\\nalgorithms are often hand-crafted hybrid heuristics which perform many restarts\\nof fast local optimization approaches. However, data-driven techniques to\\ncreate optimized restart schedules have not yet been extensively studied.\\n  Here, we present a simple scheduling approach that iteratively selects the\\nalgorithm performing best on the distribution of unsolved training problems at\\ntime of selection, resulting in a problem-independent solver schedule. We\\ndemonstrate our approach using well-known optimizers from numerical black-box\\noptimization on the BBOB testbed, bridging much of the gap between single and\\nvirtual best solver from the original portfolio across various evaluation\\nprotocols. Our greedy restart schedule presents a powerful baseline for more\\ncomplex dynamic algorithm selection models.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T17:54:21Z\"}"}
