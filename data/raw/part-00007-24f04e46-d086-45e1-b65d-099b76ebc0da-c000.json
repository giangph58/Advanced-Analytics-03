Planar Josephson junctions (PJJ) have emerged as\\na promising platform, offering robust and tunable MZM. However, the perceived\\nsensitivity of topological superconductivity to the magnetic field orientation\\nhas posed a major obstacle, particularly for scalable network architectures.\\nHere, we uncover that topological superconductivity in PJJ fundamentally\\npersists under nearly arbitrary in-plane magnetic field directions. The\\napparent collapse of the global gap under misaligned fields originates not from\\nthe destruction of superconductivity itself, but from emergent shifted bulk\\nstates from other momentum points, which obscure the gap and MZM. By\\nintroducing spatial modulations along the junction to scatter and gap out these\\nbulk states, we restore the global topological gap and recover visible MZM.\\nRemarkably, the spatially modulated PJJs render topological superconductivity\\nrobust against maligned fields, thereby enabling MZM survival across complex\\njunction networks and facilitating their braiding. We propose a scalable\\nprotocol for MZM braiding and fusion with phase or gate control, opening new\\nroutes toward scalable topological quantum computing.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:55:52Z\"}"}
