With the help of the\\nSullivan process which allows us to use a nucleon target as a quasi-real $\\\\pi$\\nmeson emitter, we study backward scattering in the framework of collinear QCD\\nfactorization where pion-to-photon transition distribution amplitudes describe\\nthe photon content of the $\\\\pi$ meson. We present a model of these TDAs based\\non the overlap of lightfront wave functions primarily developed for generalized\\nparton distributions, using a previously developed pion lightfront wave\\nfunction and deriving a new model for the lightfront wave functions of the\\nphoton. This leads us to an estimate of the cross-sections for JLab energies.\\nWe conclude that deeply virtual $ep\\\\rightarrow e\\\\gamma M n$ processes, in\\nbackward kinematics, may be experimentally discovered in the near future.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:52:59Z\"}"}
