The measurement uses a proton-proton collision dataset\\nwith an integrated luminosity of 140 fb$^{-1}$ collected at a centre-of-mass\\nenergy of 13 TeV by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Final\\nstates in which both $W$ bosons decay leptonically are targeted, and events are\\ncategorised based on the flavour of the final-state leptons, the jet\\nmultiplicity, and the output of neural network-based classifiers. The data are\\nfound to be compatible with the Standard Model expectation. An observed\\n(expected) upper limit at 95% confidence level is set on the rate of off-shell\\nHiggs boson production at a value of 3.4 (4.4) times the Standard Model\\nprediction. These results are combined with the results from the measurement of\\non-shell Higgs boson production with the same final states to obtain an\\nobserved (expected) upper limit at 95% confidence level on the Higgs boson\\ntotal width of 13.1 (17.3) MeV.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T13:01:31Z\"}"}
