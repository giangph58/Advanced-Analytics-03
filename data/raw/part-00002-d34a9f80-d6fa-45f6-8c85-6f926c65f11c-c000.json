{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06051v1\", \"title\": \"A data-driven convergence booster for accelerating and stabilizing\\n  pseudo time-stepping\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces a novel data-driven convergence booster that not only\\naccelerates convergence but also stabilizes solutions in cases where obtaining\\na steady-state solution is otherwise challenging. The method constructs a\\nreduced-order model (ROM) of the solution residual using intermediate solutions\\nand periodically solves a least-square problem in the low-dimensional ROM\\nsubspace. The second-order approximation of the residual and the use of normal\\nequation distinguish this work from similar approaches in the literature from\\nthe methodology perspective. From the application perspective, in contrast to\\nprior studies that focus on linear systems or idealized problems, we rigorously\\nassess the method's performance on realistic computational fluid dynamics (CFD)\\napplications. In addition to reducing the time complexity of point-iterative\\nsolvers for linear systems, we demonstrate substantial reductions in the number\\nof pseudo-time steps required for implicit schemes solving the nonlinear\\nNavier-Stokes equations. Across a range of two- and three-dimensional\\nflows-including subsonic inviscid and transonic turbulent cases-the method\\nconsistently achieves a 3 to 4 times speedup in wall-clock time. Lastly, the\\nproposed method acts as a robust stabilizer, capable of converging to steady\\nsolutions in flows that would otherwise exhibit persistent unsteadiness-such as\\nvortex shedding or transonic buffet-without relying on symmetry boundary\\nconditions.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:53:04Z\"}"}
