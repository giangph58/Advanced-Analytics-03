However,\\nthe current state of the art is mostly focused on mean-value time series\\npredictions and only very few methods provide probabilistic forecasts. In this\\npaper, we rely on kernel density estimation and vine copulas to construct\\nprobabilistic models for individual load profiles of private households. Our\\napproach allows the quantification of variability of individual energy\\nconsumption in general and of daily peak loads in particular. We draw upon an\\nAustralian distribution grid dataset to illustrate our findings. We generate\\nsynthetic loads that follow the distribution of the real data.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:02:42Z\"}"}
