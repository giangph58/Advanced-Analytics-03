The field equations are traceless, similarly to unimodular\\ngravity, and include quadratic curvature corrections. We find that static,\\nspherically symmetric, vacuum spacetimes in this theory split into two\\nbranches. The first branch is indistinguishable from corresponding solutions in\\nunimodular gravity and describes Schwarzschild-(Anti) de Sitter black holes.\\nThe second branch instead describes horizonless solutions and is characterized\\nby large values of the spatial curvature. We analyze the dynamics of\\nfirst-order metric perturbations on both branches, showing that there are no\\ndeviations from unimodular gravity at this level.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T09:26:01Z\"}"}
