As we show in\\nour study, this extra evolution enables different level of advantages depending\\non whether it is implemented locally or nonlocally across the sensing nodes. By\\nbenchmarking MAI strategies in both discrete- and continuous-variable systems,\\nwe show that they can significantly enhance multiparameter sensitivity and\\nrobustness against detection noise, particularly when non-Gaussian probe states\\nare employed, cases where standard linear measurements are often insufficient.\\nWe also derive analytical results for multiparameter squeezing and establish\\nthe corresponding scaling laws for spin-squeezed states, demonstrating that MAI\\nprotocols can reach the Heisenberg scaling. These results pave the way for\\nimmediate experimental implementation in platforms such as atomic ensembles and\\noptical fields.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:16:34Z\"}"}
