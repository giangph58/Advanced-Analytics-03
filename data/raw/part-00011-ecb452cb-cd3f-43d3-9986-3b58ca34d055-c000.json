In the present work two algorithms\\nare considered to compute this best approximant: an algorithm based on rational\\ninterpolation in successively corrected interpolation nodes and the AAA-Lawson\\nmethod. Moreover, a posteriori bounds are introduced to evaluate the quality of\\na computed approximant and to show convergence to the unitary best approximant\\nin practice. Two a priori estimates -- one based on experimental data, and one\\nbased on an asymptotic error estimate -- are introduced to determine the\\nunderlying frequency for which the unitary best approximant achieves a given\\naccuracy. Performance of algorithms and estimates is verified by numerical\\nexperiments. In particular, the interpolation-based algorithm converges to the\\nunitary best approximant within a small number of iterations in practice.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T10:04:47Z\"}"}
