Lightweight models address computational\\ndemands but typically strive in complex and scarce labeled-data scenarios.\\nFeature Learning from Image Markers (FLIM) learns an encoder's convolutional\\nkernels among image patches extracted from discriminative regions marked on a\\nfew representative images, dismissing large annotated datasets, pretraining,\\nand backpropagation. Such a methodology exploits information redundancy\\ncommonly found in biomedical image applications. This study presents methods to\\nlearn dilated-separable convolutional kernels and multi-dilation layers without\\nbackpropagation for FLIM networks. It also proposes a novel network\\nsimplification method to reduce kernel redundancy and encoder size. By\\ncombining a FLIM encoder with an adaptive decoder, a concept recently\\nintroduced to estimate a pointwise convolution per image, this study presents\\nvery efficient (named flyweight) SOD models for biomedical images. Experimental\\nresults in challenging datasets demonstrate superior efficiency and\\neffectiveness to lightweight models. By requiring significantly fewer\\nparameters and floating-point operations, the results show competitive\\neffectiveness to heavyweight models. These advances highlight the potential of\\nFLIM networks for data-limited and resource-constrained applications with\\ninformation redundancy.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T11:57:40Z\"}"}
