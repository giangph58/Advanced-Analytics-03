{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04468v1\", \"title\": \"Spectral and Temporal Denoising for Differentially Private Optimization\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces the FFT-Enhanced Kalman Filter (FFTKF), a\\ndifferentially private optimization method that addresses the challenge of\\npreserving performance in DP-SGD, where added noise typically degrades model\\nutility. FFTKF integrates frequency-domain noise shaping with Kalman filtering\\nto enhance gradient quality while preserving $(\\\\varepsilon, \\\\delta)$-DP\\nguarantees. It employs a high-frequency shaping mask in the Fourier domain to\\nconcentrate differential privacy noise in less informative spectral components,\\npreserving low-frequency gradient signals. A scalar-gain Kalman filter with\\nfinite-difference Hessian approximation further refines the denoised gradients.\\nWith a per-iteration complexity of $\\\\mathcal{O}(d \\\\log d)$, FFTKF demonstrates\\nimproved test accuracy over DP-SGD and DiSK across MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,\\nand Tiny-ImageNet datasets using CNNs, Wide ResNets, and Vision Transformers.\\nTheoretical analysis confirms that FFTKF maintains equivalent privacy\\nguarantees while achieving a tighter privacy-utility trade-off through reduced\\nnoise and controlled bias.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.IT,cs.NE,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:38:58Z\"}"}
