{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12046v1\", \"title\": \"The Dynamic Inner Disk of a Planet Forming Star\", \"summary\": \"Planets are a natural byproduct of the stellar formation process, resulting\\nfrom local aggregations of material within the disks surrounding young stars.\\nWhereas signatures of gas-giant planets at large orbital separations have been\\nobserved and successfully modeled within protoplanetary disks, the formation\\npathways of planets within their host star's future habitable zones remain\\npoorly understood. Analyzing multiple nights of observations conducted over a\\nshort, two-month span with the MIRC-X and PIONIER instruments at the CHARA\\nArray and VLTI, respectively, we uncover a highly active environment at the\\ninner-edge of the planet formation region in the disk of HD 163296. In\\nparticular, we localize and track the motion of a disk feature near the\\ndust-sublimation radius with a pattern speed of less than half the local\\nKeplerian velocity, providing a potential glimpse at the planet formation\\nprocess in action within the inner astronomical unit. We emphasize that this\\nresult is at the edge of what is currently possible with available optical\\ninterferometric techniques and behooves confirmation with a temporally dense\\nfollowup observing campaign.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T13:03:30Z\"}"}
