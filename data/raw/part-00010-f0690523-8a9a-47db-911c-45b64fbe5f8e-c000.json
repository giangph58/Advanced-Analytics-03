Smaller mode volumes amplify the\\nelectric field per photon, enhancing spontaneous emission, strengthening\\nnonlinear optical effects, and enabling strong coupling in cavity quantum\\nelectrodynamics. However, in lossless dielectric systems, the diffraction limit\\nhas long been considered an unbreakable barrier to light confinement. Here, we\\nuncover a novel class of wavefunctions - narwhal-shaped wavefunctions - and\\nreveal their pivotal role in enabling extreme light confinement in lossless\\ndielectrics across all spatial dimensions. Through rigorous theoretical\\nanalysis, simulations, and experimental validation, we propose and realize a\\nthree-dimensional singular cavity supported by these wavefunctions, achieving\\nan ultra-small mode volume of 5x10^-7 lambda^3 (lambda: free-space wavelength).\\nOur findings open new frontiers for unprecedented control over light-matter\\ninteractions at the smallest possible scales.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T07:33:06Z\"}"}
