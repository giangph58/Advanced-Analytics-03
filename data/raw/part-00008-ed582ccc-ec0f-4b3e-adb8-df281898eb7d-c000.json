We quantify the asymptotics of the variation of simple\\neigenvalues under the singular perturbation produced by removing a shrinking\\nset and imposing the same Robin condition on its boundary. We also study the\\nconvergence rate of the corresponding eigenfunctions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:56:55Z\"}"}
