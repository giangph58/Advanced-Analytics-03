In this\\nwok, we first calculate magnetic fields produced by them in a single bilayer\\nBi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\\\\delta}$ (Bi-2212) thin film for the purpose of\\ndetecting the SVILCs. The estimated magnitude of the magnetic field at the\\npoint 10$a$ ($a$ is the lattice constant of the CuO$_2$ plane) above the\\nsurface could be in the order of 100mT; thus, they may be detectable by\\ncurrently available detection methods. Next, we investigate the use of them as\\nqubits (the ``SVILC qubits'') in an architecture composed of three nano-islands\\nof the thin film; and consider the use of the detection of the magnetic field\\ngenerated by the SVILCs as the qubit readout. We show there are a number of\\nenergy levels suitable for qubit states that can be manipulated by external\\ncurrent feeding, and the magnetic field generated by the SVILCs is large enough\\nto be used for the readout.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T08:44:36Z\"}"}
