We explore the capability of\\nVLAST to detect sub-GeV leptophilic dark matter (DM) annihilation, focusing on\\nscalar and vector mediators and emphasizing the resonance region where the\\nmediator mass is approximately twice the DM mass. While $s$-wave annihilation\\nis tightly constrained by relic density and cosmic microwave background\\nobservations, $p$-wave and mixed $(s+p)$-wave scenarios remain viable,\\nparticularly near resonance. Additionally, direct detection experiments,\\nespecially those probing DM-electron scattering, significantly constrain\\nnonresonance parameter space but are less effective in the resonance regime.\\nVLAST can uniquely probe this surviving region, outperforming existing and\\nplanned instruments, and establishing itself as a crucial tool for indirect\\ndetection of thermal relic DM.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:53:12Z\"}"}
