{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04970v1\", \"title\": \"A High-Force Gripper with Embedded Multimodal Sensing for Powerful and\\n  Perception Driven Grasping\", \"summary\": \"Modern humanoid robots have shown their promising potential for executing\\nvarious tasks involving the grasping and manipulation of objects using their\\nend-effectors. Nevertheless, in the most of the cases, the grasping and\\nmanipulation actions involve low to moderate payload and interaction forces.\\nThis is due to limitations often presented by the end-effectors, which can not\\nmatch their arm-reachable payload, and hence limit the payload that can be\\ngrasped and manipulated. In addition, grippers usually do not embed adequate\\nperception in their hardware, and grasping actions are mainly driven by\\nperception sensors installed in the rest of the robot body, frequently affected\\nby occlusions due to the arm motions during the execution of the grasping and\\nmanipulation tasks. To address the above, we developed a modular high grasping\\nforce gripper equipped with embedded multi-modal perception functionalities.\\nThe proposed gripper can generate a grasping force of 110 N in a compact\\nimplementation. The high grasping force capability is combined with embedded\\nmulti-modal sensing, which includes an eye-in-hand camera, a Time-of-Flight\\n(ToF) distance sensor, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and an\\nomnidirectional microphone, permitting the implementation of perception-driven\\ngrasping functionalities.\\n  We extensively evaluated the grasping force capacity of the gripper by\\nintroducing novel payload evaluation metrics that are a function of the robot\\narm's dynamic motion and gripper thermal states. We also evaluated the embedded\\nmulti-modal sensing by performing perception-guided enhanced grasping\\noperations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:57:08Z\"}"}
