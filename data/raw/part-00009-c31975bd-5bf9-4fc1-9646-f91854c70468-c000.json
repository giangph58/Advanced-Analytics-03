{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00703v1\", \"title\": \"T2I-R1: Reinforcing Image Generation with Collaborative Semantic-level\\n  and Token-level CoT\", \"summary\": \"Recent advancements in large language models have demonstrated how\\nchain-of-thought (CoT) and reinforcement learning (RL) can improve performance.\\nHowever, applying such reasoning strategies to the visual generation domain\\nremains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present T2I-R1, a novel\\nreasoning-enhanced text-to-image generation model, powered by RL with a\\nbi-level CoT reasoning process. Specifically, we identify two levels of CoT\\nthat can be utilized to enhance different stages of generation: (1) the\\nsemantic-level CoT for high-level planning of the prompt and (2) the\\ntoken-level CoT for low-level pixel processing during patch-by-patch\\ngeneration. To better coordinate these two levels of CoT, we introduce\\nBiCoT-GRPO with an ensemble of generation rewards, which seamlessly optimizes\\nboth generation CoTs within the same training step. By applying our reasoning\\nstrategies to the baseline model, Janus-Pro, we achieve superior performance\\nwith 13% improvement on T2I-CompBench and 19% improvement on the WISE\\nbenchmark, even surpassing the state-of-the-art model FLUX.1.
