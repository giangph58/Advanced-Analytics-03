This paper presents the\\noptimization of a renewable energy community in Spain, consisting of four\\noffice buildings, a collectively owned centralized photovoltaic system, and a\\nLi-ion battery storage system. The case study assesses the performance and\\nfeasibility of the proposed solutions. The results indicate a 6% reduction in\\nemissions and a 20% reduction in electricity costs, demonstrating the potential\\nof LECs to enhance energy security by saving costs and emission while\\nmitigating the vulnerability of local areas to power outages and disruptions\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:42:43Z\"}"}
