{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04752v1\", \"title\": \"Investigating Popularity Bias Amplification in Recommender Systems\\n  Employed in the Entertainment Domain\", \"summary\": \"Recommender systems have become an integral part of our daily online\\nexperience by analyzing past user behavior to suggest relevant content in\\nentertainment domains such as music, movies, and books. Today, they are among\\nthe most widely used applications of AI and machine learning. Consequently,\\nregulations and guidelines for trustworthy AI, such as the European AI Act,\\nwhich addresses issues like bias and fairness, are highly relevant to the\\ndesign, development, and evaluation of recommender systems. One particularly\\nimportant type of bias in this context is popularity bias, which results in the\\nunfair underrepresentation of less popular content in recommendation lists.\\nThis work summarizes our research on investigating the amplification of\\npopularity bias in recommender systems within the entertainment sector.\\nAnalyzing datasets from three entertainment domains, music, movies, and anime,\\nwe demonstrate that an item's recommendation frequency is positively correlated\\nwith its popularity. As a result, user groups with little interest in popular\\ncontent receive less accurate recommendations compared to those who prefer\\nwidely popular items. Furthermore, we aim to better understand the connection\\nbetween recommendation accuracy, calibration quality of algorithms, and\\npopularity bias amplification.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T05:58:01Z\"}"}
