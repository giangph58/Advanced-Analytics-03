{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10212v1\", \"title\": \"WG-IDENT: Weak Group Identification of PDEs with Varying Coefficients\", \"summary\": \"Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) identification is a data-driven method\\nfor mathematical modeling, and has received a lot of attentions recently. The\\nstability and precision in identifying PDE from heavily noisy spatiotemporal\\ndata present significant difficulties. This problem becomes even more complex\\nwhen the coefficients of the PDEs are subject to spatial variation. In this\\npaper, we propose a Weak formulation of Group-sparsity-based framework for\\nIDENTifying PDEs with varying coefficients, called WG-IDENT, to tackle this\\nchallenge. Our approach utilizes the weak formulation of PDEs to reduce the\\nimpact of noise. We represent test functions and unknown PDE coefficients using\\nB-splines, where the knot vectors of test functions are optimally selected\\nbased on spectral analysis of the noisy data. To facilitate feature selection,\\nwe propose to integrate group sparse regression with a newly designed group\\nfeature trimming technique, called GF-trim, to eliminate unimportant features.\\nExtensive and comparative ablation studies are conducted to validate our\\nproposed method. The proposed method not only demonstrates greater robustness\\nto high noise levels compared to state-of-the-art algorithms but also achieves\\nsuperior performance while exhibiting reduced sensitivity to hyperparameter\\nselection.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T13:26:56Z\"}"}
