{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05284v1\", \"title\": \"FERIVer: An FPGA-assisted Emulated Framework for RTL Verification of\\n  RISC-V Processors\", \"summary\": \"Processor design and verification require a synergistic approach that\\ncombines instruction-level functional simulations with precise hardware\\nemulations. The trade-off between speed and accuracy in the instruction set\\nsimulation poses a significant challenge to the efficiency of processor\\nverification. By tapping the potentials of Field Programmable Gate Arrays\\n(FPGAs), we propose an FPGA-assisted System-on-Chip (SoC) platform that\\nfacilitates cross-verification by the embedded CPU and the synthesized hardware\\nin the programmable fabrics. This method accelerates the verification of the\\nRISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) processor at a speed of 5 million\\ninstructions per second (MIPS), which is 150x faster than the vendor-specific\\ntool (Xilinx XSim) and a 35x boost to the state-of-the-art open-source\\nverification setup (Verilator). With less than 7\\\\% hardware occupation on Zynq\\n7000 FPGA, the proposed framework enables flexible verification with high time\\nand cost efficiency for exploring RISC-V instruction set architectures.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AR\", \"categories\": \"cs.AR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T17:34:05Z\"}"}
