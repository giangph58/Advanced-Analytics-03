{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11922v1\", \"title\": \"Zooming In on Fakes: A Novel Dataset for Localized AI-Generated Image\\n  Detection with Forgery Amplification Approach\", \"summary\": \"The rise of AI-generated image editing tools has made localized forgeries\\nincreasingly realistic, posing challenges for visual content integrity.\\nAlthough recent efforts have explored localized AIGC detection, existing\\ndatasets predominantly focus on object-level forgeries while overlooking\\nbroader scene edits in regions such as sky or ground. To address these\\nlimitations, we introduce \\\\textbf{BR-Gen}, a large-scale dataset of 150,000\\nlocally forged images with diverse scene-aware annotations, which are based on\\nsemantic calibration to ensure high-quality samples. BR-Gen is constructed\\nthrough a fully automated Perception-Creation-Evaluation pipeline to ensure\\nsemantic coherence and visual realism. In addition, we further propose\\n\\\\textbf{NFA-ViT}, a Noise-guided Forgery Amplification Vision Transformer that\\nenhances the detection of localized forgeries by amplifying forgery-related\\nfeatures across the entire image. NFA-ViT mines heterogeneous regions in\\nimages, \\\\emph{i.e.}, potential edited areas, by noise fingerprints.\\nSubsequently, attention mechanism is introduced to compel the interaction\\nbetween normal and abnormal features, thereby propagating the generalization\\ntraces throughout the entire image, allowing subtle forgeries to influence a\\nbroader context and improving overall detection robustness. Extensive\\nexperiments demonstrate that BR-Gen constructs entirely new scenarios that are\\nnot covered by existing methods. Take a step further, NFA-ViT outperforms\\nexisting methods on BR-Gen and generalizes well across current benchmarks.
