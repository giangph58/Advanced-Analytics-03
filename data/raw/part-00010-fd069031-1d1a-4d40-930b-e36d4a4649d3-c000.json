Consequently, increasing the coupling strength to the\\nsuperconductor can paradoxically suppress the proximity-induced\\nsuperconductivity in the semiconductor by enhancing these insulating gaps. We\\ndemonstrate that the presence of such induced insulating gaps leads to a\\ncharacteristic anomalous behavior of the critical supercurrent in Josephson\\njunctions based on these hybrid structures. Our findings provide important\\ninsights for the design of robust quantum computing platforms utilizing hybrid\\nsuperconductor-hole systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:23:53Z\"}"}
