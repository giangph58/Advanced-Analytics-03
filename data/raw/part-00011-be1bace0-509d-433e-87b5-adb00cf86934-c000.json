Formal verification of\\nthese systems is challenging due to the size and complexity of the perception\\nDNNs as well as hard-to-quantify, changing environment conditions. To address\\nthese challenges, we propose a probabilistic verification framework for\\nautonomous systems based on the following key concepts: (1) Scenario-based\\nModeling: We decompose the task (e.g., car navigation) into a composition of\\nscenarios, each representing a different environment condition. (2)\\nProbabilistic Abstractions: For each scenario, we build a compact abstraction\\nof perception based on the DNN's performance on an offline dataset that\\nrepresents the scenario's environment condition. (3) Symbolic Reasoning and\\nAcceleration: The abstractions enable efficient compositional verification of\\nthe autonomous system via symbolic reasoning and a novel acceleration proof\\nrule that bounds the error probability of the system under arbitrary variations\\nof environment conditions. We illustrate our approach on two case studies: an\\nexperimental autonomous system that guides airplanes on taxiways using\\nhigh-dimensional perception DNNs and a simulation model of an F1Tenth\\nautonomous car using LiDAR observations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:06:22Z\"}"}
