The dipole-pion cross section as function of transverse\\nseparation $\\\\bf r$ at small Bjorken variable $\\\\beta$ is parameterized within\\nthe bSat model.\\n  The evolution of the dipole-pion cross section is performed applying the\\nLaplace transformation technique. We demonstrate that geometric scaling\\n  for the dipole-pion cross section hold approximately within a wide kinematic\\nregion of $rQ_s$. The geometrical scaling is improved applying the evolution\\nmethod. That is compared with the constituent quark picture and the color\\ndipole BFKL expansion. The cross section saturates at large dipole sizes.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T10:53:08Z\"}"}
