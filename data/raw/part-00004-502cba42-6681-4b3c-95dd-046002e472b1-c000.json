Many processes are involved in\\nthe glucose regulation, and their interactions are very complex. To better\\nunderstand those processes we set ourselves a goal to create a Petri net model\\nof the glucose regulation in the whole body. So far we have managed to create a\\nmodel of glycolysis and synthesis of glucose in the liver, and the general\\noverview models of the glucose regulation in a healthy and diabetic person. In\\nthis paper we introduce Petri nets models of insulin secretion in beta cell of\\nthe pancreas, and glucagon in the pancreas alpha cells. Those two hormones have\\nmutually opposite effects: insulin preventing hyperglycemia, and glucagon\\npreventing hypoglycemia. Understanding the mechanisms of insulin and glucagon\\nsecretion constitutes the basis for understanding diabetes. We also present a\\nmodel in which both processes occur together, depending on the blood glucose\\nlevel. The dynamics of each model is analysed. Additionally, we transform the\\noverall insulin and glucagon secretion system to a Boolean network, following\\nstandard transformation rules.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.CB\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.CB,cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T12:36:02Z\"}"}
