In this paper, we introduce\\nClust-Splitter, an efficient algorithm based on nonsmooth optimization,\\ndesigned to solve the minimum sum-of-squares clustering problem in very large\\ndatasets. The clustering task is approached through a sequence of three\\nnonsmooth optimization problems: two auxiliary problems used to generate\\nsuitable starting points, followed by a main clustering formulation. To solve\\nthese problems effectively, the limited memory bundle method is combined with\\nan incremental approach to develop the Clust-Splitter algorithm. We evaluate\\nClust-Splitter on real-world datasets characterized by both a large number of\\nattributes and a large number of data points and compare its performance with\\nseveral state-of-the-art large-scale clustering algorithms. Experimental\\nresults demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method for clustering very\\nlarge datasets, as well as the high quality of its solutions, which are on par\\nwith those of the best existing methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T13:13:46Z\"}"}
