{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11369v1\", \"title\": \"OpenTuringBench: An Open-Model-based Benchmark and Framework for\\n  Machine-Generated Text Detection and Attribution\", \"summary\": \"Open Large Language Models (OLLMs) are increasingly leveraged in generative\\nAI applications, posing new challenges for detecting their outputs. We propose\\nOpenTuringBench, a new benchmark based on OLLMs, designed to train and evaluate\\nmachine-generated text detectors on the Turing Test and Authorship Attribution\\nproblems. OpenTuringBench focuses on a representative set of OLLMs, and\\nfeatures a number of challenging evaluation tasks, including\\nhuman/machine-manipulated texts, out-of-domain texts, and texts from previously\\nunseen models. We also provide OTBDetector, a contrastive learning framework to\\ndetect and attribute OLLM-based machine-generated texts. Results highlight the\\nrelevance and varying degrees of difficulty of the OpenTuringBench tasks, with\\nour detector achieving remarkable capabilities across the various tasks and\\noutperforming most existing detectors.
