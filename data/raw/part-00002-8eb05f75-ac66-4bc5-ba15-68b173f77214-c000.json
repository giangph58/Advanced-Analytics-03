The detector was planned as a trigger for cosmic ray particles\\nand to be used to calibrate and test other systems. Additional functions were\\nto be the detection of pairs of high-energy muons originating from some\\nparti-cle decay processes generated during collisions and con-tinuous\\nobservation of the cosmic muon stream in order to detect multi muons events.\\nFrom the very beginning, the detector was designed as a scalable and universal\\ndevice for many applications. The following work will present the basic\\nfeatures and parameters of the Modular COsmic Ray Detector (MCORD) and examples\\nof its possible use in high energy physics, astrophysics and geology. Thanks to\\nits universal nature, MCORD can be potential used as a fast trigger, neutron\\nveto detector, muon detector and as a tool in muon tomography.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det,astro-ph.IM,physics.app-ph,J.2.m\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:04:43Z\"}"}
