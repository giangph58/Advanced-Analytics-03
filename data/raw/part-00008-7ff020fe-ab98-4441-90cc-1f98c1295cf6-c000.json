{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15125v1\", \"title\": \"Contemplative Wisdom for Superalignment\", \"summary\": \"As artificial intelligence (AI) improves, traditional alignment strategies\\nmay falter in the face of unpredictable self-improvement, hidden subgoals, and\\nthe sheer complexity of intelligent systems. Rather than externally\\nconstraining behavior, we advocate designing AI with intrinsic morality built\\ninto its cognitive architecture and world model. Inspired by contemplative\\nwisdom traditions, we show how four axiomatic principles can instil a resilient\\nWise World Model in AI systems. First, mindfulness enables self-monitoring and\\nrecalibration of emergent subgoals. Second, emptiness forestalls dogmatic goal\\nfixation and relaxes rigid priors. Third, non-duality dissolves adversarial\\nself-other boundaries. Fourth, boundless care motivates the universal reduction\\nof suffering. We find that prompting AI to reflect on these principles improves\\nperformance on the AILuminate Benchmark using GPT-4o, particularly when\\ncombined. We offer detailed implementation strategies for state-of-the-art\\nmodels, including contemplative architectures, constitutions, and reinforcement\\nof chain-of-thought. For future systems, the active inference framework may\\noffer the self-organizing and dynamic coupling capabilities needed to enact\\nthese insights in embodied agents. This interdisciplinary approach offers a\\nself-correcting and resilient alternative to prevailing brittle control\\nschemes.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T14:20:49Z\"}"}
