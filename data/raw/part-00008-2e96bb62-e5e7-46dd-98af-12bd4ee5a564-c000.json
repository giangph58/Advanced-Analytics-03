In this work,\\nwe propose an agnostic test that simultaneously constrains the dark energy (DE)\\nequation of state (EoS) and probes the possibility of a transition between the\\nquintessence and phantom regimes, or vice versa. Our initial approach is\\nindependent of physical priors, allowing the data to determine which behavior\\nbest fits the parameters. We then consider a minimally modified gravity theory\\nknown as VCDM, into which we can map our initial approximation, placing it\\nwithin a theoretically stable framework. To this end, we incorporate the most\\nup-to-date datasets available, including BAO measurements from DESI-DR2, Type\\nIa Supernovae from the PantheonPlus, DESY5, and Union3 samples, as well as\\nCosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from Planck. Our analysis reveals strong\\nand statistically significant evidence for a quintessence-phantom transition\\nacross various data combinations. \\\\textit{The strongest evidence is found for\\nPlanck+DESI+DESY5, with a significance exceeding $\\\\sim$5$\\\\sigma$ in favor of a\\nquintessence-phantom transition at $z_{\\\\dag} = 0.493^{+0.063}_{-0.081}$}.\\nBeyond this redshift, the EoS remains within the phantom regime, while for $z <\\nz_{\\\\dag}$, it favors the quintessence regime. Despite this strong indication,\\n\\\\textit{we find that such transitions do not resolve the $H_0$ tension}.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T11:38:28Z\"}"}
