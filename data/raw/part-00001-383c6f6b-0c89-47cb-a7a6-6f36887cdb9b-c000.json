For a fair comparison, all\\nthe three waveforms are evaluated using variants of common frequency domain\\nequalization (FDE). To this end, a novel cross domain iterative detection for\\nOTFS is proposed. The performance of the different waveforms is evaluated\\nnumerically in terms of pragmatic capacity. The numerical results show that\\nOTFS significantly outperforms SC and OFDM at cost of reasonably increased\\ncomplexity, because of the low cyclic-prefix (CP) overhead and the\\neffectiveness of the proposed detection.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T05:47:45Z\"}"}
