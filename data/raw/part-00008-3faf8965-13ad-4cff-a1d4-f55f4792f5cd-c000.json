Here, we put forward\\ncontinuous-variable counterparts of the recently introduced entanglement\\ncriteria based on moments of the partially transposed state, together with\\nsimple readout schemes that require only a few replicas of the state, passive\\nlinear optics, and particle-number measurements. Our multicopy method enables\\nthe detection of genuine non-Gaussian entanglement for various relevant state\\nfamilies overlooked by standard approaches, which includes the entire class of\\nNOON states. Further, it is robust against realistic experimental constraints\\n(losses, noise, and finite statistics), which we demonstrate by extensive\\nnumerical simulations.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T12:22:30Z\"}"}
