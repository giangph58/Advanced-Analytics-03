Novel spin textures such as skyrmions provide one possible\\navenue forward due to their topological protection and controllability via\\nelectric fields. However, the common signature of these spin textures, the\\ntopological Hall effect (THE), can be mimicked by other trivial effects.\\nCompeting anomalous Hall effect (AHE) components can produce a peak in the Hall\\nvoltage similar to that of the THE, making clear identification of the THE\\ndifficult. By applying the first-order reversal curve (FORC) technique to the\\nHall effect in candidate topological Hall systems we can clearly distinguish\\nbetween the THE and AHE. This technique allows for quantitative investigation\\nof the THE and AHE in magnetic materials and heterostructures with\\ntopologically non-trivial spin textures. We demonstrate the technique and apply\\nit to several examples.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T14:46:22Z\"}"}
