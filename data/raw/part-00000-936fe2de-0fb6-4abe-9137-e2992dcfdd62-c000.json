{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23875v1\", \"title\": \"GenSwarm: Scalable Multi-Robot Code-Policy Generation and Deployment via\\n  Language Models\", \"summary\": \"The development of control policies for multi-robot systems traditionally\\nfollows a complex and labor-intensive process, often lacking the flexibility to\\nadapt to dynamic tasks. This has motivated research on methods to automatically\\ncreate control policies. However, these methods require iterative processes of\\nmanually crafting and refining objective functions, thereby prolonging the\\ndevelopment cycle. This work introduces \\\\textit{GenSwarm}, an end-to-end system\\nthat leverages large language models to automatically generate and deploy\\ncontrol policies for multi-robot tasks based on simple user instructions in\\nnatural language. As a multi-language-agent system, GenSwarm achieves zero-shot\\nlearning, enabling rapid adaptation to altered or unseen tasks. The white-box\\nnature of the code policies ensures strong reproducibility and\\ninterpretability. With its scalable software and hardware architectures,\\nGenSwarm supports efficient policy deployment on both simulated and real-world\\nmulti-robot systems, realizing an instruction-to-execution end-to-end\\nfunctionality that could prove valuable for robotics specialists and\\nnon-specialists alike.The code of the proposed GenSwarm system is available\\nonline: https://github.com/WindyLab/GenSwarm.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI,cs.MA\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T09:26:34Z\"}"}
