{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12017v1\", \"title\": \"Unified Multipole Bott Indices for Non-Hermitian Skin Effect in\\n  Different Orders\", \"summary\": \"Non-Hermitian systems exhibit a distinctive phenomenon known as the\\nnon-Hermitian skin effect, where an extensive number of eigenstates become\\nlocalized at the boundaries of a lattice with open boundaries. While the\\nspectral winding number under periodic boundary conditions is a\\nwell-established topological indicator for predicting the skin effect in\\none-dimensional non-Hermitian systems, a suitable topological invariant to\\ndiagnose higher-order skin effects remains elusive. In this Letter, we propose\\na unified non-Hermitian multipole characterization framework that generalizes\\nthe concept of spectral winding to higher-order skin effects. Specifically, we\\ndevelop a set of non-Hermitian multipole Bott indices capable of diagnosing\\nskin effects of different orders. Our approach provides a comprehensive\\nunderstanding of both first- and higher-order skin effects in non-Hermitian\\nsystems, offering new perspectives for exploring topological phenomena in\\nnon-Hermitian systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T12:17:42Z\"}"}
