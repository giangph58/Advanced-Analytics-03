Recent experiments bend the mechanical oscillator (cantilever) in units\\nof nm via electrostatic actuators. We do not bend the cantilever but merely\\nelectrically-tune the gap intensity, so plasmo-mechanical coupling, via Fano\\nresonance. This allows continuous displacement tuning in units of mechanical\\noscillator length that is about 30 fm in the experiments. This way, coupling\\nstrength can be tuned by 2 orders-of-magnitude via only a 1 V potential\\ndifference. Response time is picoseconds. Moreover, quadrature-squeezing\\n(entanglement) of the oscillator can also be tuned continuously.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T15:19:21Z\"}"}
