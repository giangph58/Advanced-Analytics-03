That is, we\\nasymptotically determine the constant $c=c(H,\\\\Delta,\\\\omega)$ such that\\nex$(n,H,\\\\{K_{1,\\\\Delta+1},K_{\\\\omega+1}\\\\})=(1-o_n(1))cn$. More generally, if $H$\\nhas at least $u$ dominating vertices, then we find the maximum density of\\nsubgraphs isomorphic to $H$ in graphs $G$ that have $p$ cliques of size $u$,\\nhave bounded clique number, and are $K_u\\\\vee I_{\\\\Delta+1}$-free. For example,\\nwe asymptotically determine the constant $d=d(H,\\\\Delta,\\\\omega)$ such that\\nmex$(m,H,\\\\{K_{1,1,\\\\Delta+1},K_{\\\\omega+1}\\\\})=(1-o_m(1))dm$. Then we localize\\nthese results, proving a tight inequality involving the sizes of the locally\\nlargest cliques and complete split graphs.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T15:02:24Z\"}"}
