{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01339v1\", \"title\": \"Computing Time-varying Network Reliability using Binary Decision\\n  Diagrams\", \"summary\": \"Computing the reliability of a time-varying network, taking into account its\\ndynamic nature, is crucial for networks that change over time, such as space\\nnetworks, vehicular ad-hoc networks, and drone networks. These networks are\\nmodeled using temporal graphs, in which each edge is labeled with a time\\nindicating its existence at a specific point in time. The time-varying network\\nreliability is defined as the probability that a data packet from the source\\nvertex can reach the terminal vertex, following links with increasing time\\nlabels (i.e., a journey), while taking into account the possibility of network\\nlink failures. Currently, the existing method for calculating this reliability\\ninvolves explicitly enumerating all possible journeys between the source and\\nterminal vertices and then calculating the reliability using the sum of\\ndisjoint products method. However, this method has high computational\\ncomplexity. In contrast, there is an efficient algorithm that uses binary\\ndecision diagrams (BDDs) to evaluate the reliability of a network whose\\ntopology does not change over time. This paper presents an efficient exact\\nalgorithm that utilizes BDDs for computing the time-varying network\\nreliability. Experimental results show that the proposed method runs faster\\nthan the existing method up to four orders of magnitude.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T03:58:50Z\"}"}
