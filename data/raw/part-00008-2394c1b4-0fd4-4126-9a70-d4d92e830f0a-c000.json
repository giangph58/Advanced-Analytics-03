We show that\\nrecent techniques for proving induced analogues of Menger's Theorem and the\\nGrid Theorem of Robertson and Seymour can be lifted to prove induced variants\\nin clique-sparse graph classes when replacing ``treewidth'' by\\n''tree-independence number''.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,cs.DM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T16:34:20Z\"}"}
