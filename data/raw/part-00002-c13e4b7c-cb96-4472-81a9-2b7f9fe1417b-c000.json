{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07872v1\", \"title\": \"Dual Engines of Thoughts: A Depth-Breadth Integration Framework for\\n  Open-Ended Analysis\", \"summary\": \"We propose the Dual Engines of Thoughts (DEoT), an analytical framework for\\ncomprehensive open-ended reasoning. While traditional reasoning frameworks\\nprimarily focus on finding \\\"the best answer\\\" or \\\"the correct answer\\\" for\\nsingle-answer problems, DEoT is specifically designed for \\\"open-ended\\nquestions,\\\" enabling both broader and deeper analytical exploration. The\\nframework centers on three key components: a Base Prompter for refining user\\nqueries, a Solver Agent that orchestrates task decomposition, execution, and\\nvalidation, and a Dual-Engine System consisting of a Breadth Engine (to explore\\ndiverse impact factors) and a Depth Engine (to perform deep investigations).\\nThis integrated design allows DEoT to balance wide-ranging coverage with\\nin-depth analysis, and it is highly customizable, enabling users to adjust\\nanalytical parameters and tool configurations based on specific requirements.\\nExperimental results show that DEoT excels in addressing complex, multi-faceted\\nquestions, achieving a total win rate of 77-86% compared to existing reasoning\\nmodels, thus highlighting its effectiveness in real-world applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.CE,cs.CL,cs.MA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:46:03Z\"}"}
