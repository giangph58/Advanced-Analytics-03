{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03195v1\", \"title\": \"QiMeng-CPU-v2: Automated Superscalar Processor Design by Learning Data\\n  Dependencies\", \"summary\": \"Automated processor design, which can significantly reduce human efforts and\\naccelerate design cycles, has received considerable attention. While recent\\nadvancements have automatically designed single-cycle processors that execute\\none instruction per cycle, their performance cannot compete with modern\\nsuperscalar processors that execute multiple instructions per cycle. Previous\\nmethods fail on superscalar processor design because they cannot address\\ninter-instruction data dependencies, leading to inefficient sequential\\ninstruction execution.\\n  This paper proposes a novel approach to automatically designing superscalar\\nprocessors using a hardware-friendly model called the Stateful Binary\\nSpeculation Diagram (State-BSD). We observe that processor parallelism can be\\nenhanced through on-the-fly inter-instruction dependent data predictors,\\nreusing the processor's internal states to learn the data dependency. To meet\\nthe challenge of both hardware-resource limitation and design functional\\ncorrectness, State-BSD consists of two components: 1) a lightweight\\nstate-selector trained by the simulated annealing method to detect the most\\nreusable processor states and store them in a small buffer; and 2) a highly\\nprecise state-speculator trained by the BSD expansion method to predict the\\ninter-instruction dependent data using the selected states. It is the first\\nwork to achieve the automated superscalar processor design, i.e. QiMeng-CPU-v2,\\nwhich improves the performance by about $380\\\\times$ than the state-of-the-art\\nautomated design and is comparable to human-designed superscalar processors\\nsuch as ARM Cortex A53.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AR\", \"categories\": \"cs.AR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T05:32:34Z\"}"}
