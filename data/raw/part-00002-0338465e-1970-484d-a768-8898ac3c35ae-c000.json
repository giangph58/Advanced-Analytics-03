{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04299v1\", \"title\": \"WALLABY pilot survey: properties of HI-selected dark sources and low\\n  surface brightness galaxies\", \"summary\": \"We examine the optical counterparts of the 1829 neutral hydrogen (HI)\\ndetections in three pilot fields in the Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky\\nBlind surveY (WALLABY) using data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument\\n(DESI) Legacy Imaging Surveys DR10. We find that 17 per cent (315) of the\\ndetections are optically low surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs; mean $g$-band\\nsurface brightness within 1 $ R_e$ of $> 23$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$) and 3 per cent\\n(55) are optically 'dark'. We find that the gas-rich WALLABY LSBGs have low\\nstar formation efficiencies, and have stellar masses spanning five orders of\\nmagnitude, which highlights the diversity of properties across our sample. 75\\nper cent of the LSBGs and all of the dark HI sources had not been catalogued\\nprior to WALLABY. We examine the optically dark sample of the WALLABY pilot\\nsurvey to verify the fidelity of the catalogue and investigate the implications\\nfor the full survey for identifying dark HI sources. We assess the HI\\ndetections without optical counterparts and identify 38 which pass further\\nreliability tests. Of these, we find that 13 show signatures of tidal\\ninteractions. The remaining 25 detections have no obvious tidal origin, so are\\ncandidates for isolated galaxies with high HI masses, but low stellar masses\\nand star-formation rates. Deeper HI and optical follow-up observations are\\nrequired to verify the true nature of these dark sources.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T10:12:33Z\"}"}
