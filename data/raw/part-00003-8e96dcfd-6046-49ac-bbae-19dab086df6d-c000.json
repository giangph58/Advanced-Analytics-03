While higher-order schemes have\\nbeen extensively studied, the landscape of second-order decompositions remains\\npoorly understood in practice. We explore how term ordering and recursive\\napplication of the Suzuki formula generate a broad family of approximants\\nbeyond standard Strang splitting, introducing a hybrid heuristic that minimizes\\nlocal error bounds and a fractional approach with tunable sequence length. The\\nhybrid method consistently selects the longest possible decomposition,\\nachieving the lowest error but at the cost of exponential gate overhead, while\\nfractional decompositions often match or exceed this performance with far fewer\\ngates, enabling offline selection of near-optimal approximants for practical\\nquantum simulation. This offers a simple, compiler-accessible heuristic for\\nbalancing accuracy and cost, and highlights an underexplored region of\\ndecomposition space where many low-cost approximants may achieve high accuracy\\nwithout global optimization. Finally, we show that in the presence of\\ndepolarising noise, fractional decompositions become advantageous as systems\\napproach fault-tolerant error rates, providing a practical path for balancing\\nnoise resistance and simulation accuracy.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:45:36Z\"}"}
