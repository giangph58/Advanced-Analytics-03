Specifically, using Lojasiewicz-Simon\\ninequality, we have shown that the global solution approaches an equilibrium\\nstate. Also, we have analyzed the rate at which the solution approaches\\nequilibrium. Finally, we have proven the existence of a global attractor.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T07:47:52Z\"}"}
