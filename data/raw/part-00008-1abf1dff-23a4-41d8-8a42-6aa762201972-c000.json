{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03527v1\", \"title\": \"Slowly Rotating Neutron Stars in Aether Scalar-Tensor Theory\", \"summary\": \"Aether Scalar-Tensor theory is a relativistic alternative gravity model that\\nbehaves like cold dark matter on cosmological scales while predicting the MOND\\nforce-law in astrophysical systems. The theory correctly predicts the cosmic\\nmicrowave background and linear matter power spectra, and the mass\\ndiscrepancies observed across the Universe. We derive and solve the equations\\ngoverning neutron stars in Aether Scalar Tensor theory at first-order in slow\\nrotation, finding that the theory predicts approximate universal relations\\nbetween the moment of inertia and the compactness ($I$--$C$ relations) that\\ndiffer from their general relativity counterparts. These relations may enable\\ntests of Aether Scalar-Tensor theory using X-ray observations of pulsars and\\ngravitational wave observations of binary neutron star mergers.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.HE,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T13:37:23Z\"}"}
