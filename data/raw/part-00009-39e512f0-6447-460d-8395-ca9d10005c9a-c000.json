{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05903v1\", \"title\": \"A construction of multiple group racks\", \"summary\": \"A multiple group rack is a rack which is a disjoint union of groups equipped\\nwith a binary operation satisfying some conditions. It is used to define\\ninvariants of spatial surfaces, i.e., oriented compact surfaces with boundaries\\nembedded in the $3$-sphere $S^{3}$. A $G$-family of racks is a set with a\\nfamily of binary operations indexed by the elements of a group $G$. There are\\ntwo known methods for constructing multiple group racks. One is via a\\n$G$-family of racks. The resulting multiple group rack is called the associated\\nmultiple group rack of the $G$-family of racks. The other is by taking an\\nabelian extension of a multiple group rack. In this paper, we introduce a new\\nmethod for constructing multiple group racks by using a $G$-family of racks and\\na normal subgroup $N$ of $G$. We show that this construction yields multiple\\ngroup racks that are neither the associated multiple group racks of any\\n$G$-family of racks nor their abelian extensions when the right conjugation\\naction of $G$ on $N$ is nontrivial. As an application, we present a pair of\\nspatial surfaces that cannot be distinguished by invariants derived from the\\nassociated multiple group racks of any $G$-family of racks, yet can be\\ndistinguished using invariants obtained from a multiple group rack introduced\\nin this paper.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GT\", \"categories\": \"math.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T11:01:42Z\"}"}
