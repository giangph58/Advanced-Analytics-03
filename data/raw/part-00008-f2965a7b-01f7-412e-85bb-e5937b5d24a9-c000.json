{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01451v1\", \"title\": \"Dynamic Initialization for LiDAR-inertial SLAM\", \"summary\": \"The accuracy of the initial state, including initial velocity, gravity\\ndirection, and IMU biases, is critical for the initialization of LiDAR-inertial\\nSLAM systems. Inaccurate initial values can reduce initialization speed or lead\\nto failure. When the system faces urgent tasks, robust and fast initialization\\nis required while the robot is moving, such as during the swift assessment of\\nrescue environments after natural disasters, bomb disposal, and restarting\\nLiDAR-inertial SLAM in rescue missions. However, existing initialization\\nmethods usually require the platform to remain stationary, which is ineffective\\nwhen the robot is in motion. To address this issue, this paper introduces a\\nrobust and fast dynamic initialization method for LiDAR-inertial systems\\n(D-LI-Init). This method iteratively aligns LiDAR-based odometry with IMU\\nmeasurements to achieve system initialization. To enhance the reliability of\\nthe LiDAR odometry module, the LiDAR and gyroscope are tightly integrated\\nwithin the ESIKF framework. The gyroscope compensates for rotational distortion\\nin the point cloud. Translational distortion compensation occurs during the\\niterative update phase, resulting in the output of LiDAR-gyroscope odometry.\\nThe proposed method can initialize the system no matter the robot is moving or\\nstationary. Experiments on public datasets and real-world environments\\ndemonstrate that the D-LI-Init algorithm can effectively serve various\\nplatforms, including vehicles, handheld devices, and UAVs. D-LI-Init completes\\ndynamic initialization regardless of specific motion patterns. To benefit the\\nresearch community, we have open-sourced our code and test datasets on GitHub.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:02:25Z\"}"}
