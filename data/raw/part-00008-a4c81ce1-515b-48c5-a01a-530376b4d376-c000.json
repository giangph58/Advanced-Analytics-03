{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07059v1\", \"title\": \"Forcing mass transfer approach in multicomponent miscible mixtures using\\n  the lattice Boltzmann method\", \"summary\": \"While the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) has proven robust in areas like\\ngeneral fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and multiphase modeling, its application\\nto mass transfer has been limited. Current modeling strategies often\\noversimplify the complexities required for accurate and realistic mass transfer\\nsimulations in multicomponent miscible mixtures involving external forces. We\\npropose a forcing approach within the explicit velocity-difference LBM\\nframework to address these limitations. Our approach recovers the macroscopic\\nmass conservation equations, the Navier-Stokes equation with external forcing\\nterm, and the full Maxwell-Stefan equation for ideal mixtures at low Knudsen\\nnumbers. A novel boundary scheme for impermeable solid walls is also suggested\\nto ensure proper mass conservation while effectively managing the spatial\\ninterpolations required for multicomponent mixtures with varying molecular\\nmasses. We demonstrated the physical consistency and accuracy of the proposed\\nforcing approach through simulations of the ultracentrifuge separation of\\nuranium isotopes and the Loschmidt tube with gravitational effects. Our\\napproach encompasses advanced modeling of species dynamics influenced by force\\nfields, such as those encountered in geological CO$_2$ sequestration in\\naquifers and oil reservoirs under gravitational fields.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn,nlin.CG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T17:21:35Z\"}"}
