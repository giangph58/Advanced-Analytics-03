A\\ntheoretical description of the behavior of the microwave absorption amplitude\\nis made taking into account the temperature dependence of resistivity, magnetic\\nsusceptibility and the lifetime of spin fluctuations. An assumption has been\\nmade that the deviation from the linear dependence of resistivity on\\ntemperature at $T<100$ K is not related to the electron-electron scattering\\nmechanism, but it is due to the appearance of nematic fluctuations. Estimates\\nof the rate of scattering by spin fluctuations indicate their nematic nature at\\ntemperatures near the structural transition.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T13:04:29Z\"}"}
