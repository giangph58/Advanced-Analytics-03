{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04119v1\", \"title\": \"GAPrompt: Geometry-Aware Point Cloud Prompt for 3D Vision Model\", \"summary\": \"Pre-trained 3D vision models have gained significant attention for their\\npromising performance on point cloud data. However, fully fine-tuning these\\nmodels for downstream tasks is computationally expensive and storage-intensive.\\nExisting parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approaches, which focus\\nprimarily on input token prompting, struggle to achieve competitive performance\\ndue to their limited ability to capture the geometric information inherent in\\npoint clouds. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Geometry-Aware\\nPoint Cloud Prompt (GAPrompt) that leverages geometric cues to enhance the\\nadaptability of 3D vision models. First, we introduce a Point Prompt that\\nserves as an auxiliary input alongside the original point cloud, explicitly\\nguiding the model to capture fine-grained geometric details. Additionally, we\\npresent a Point Shift Prompter designed to extract global shape information\\nfrom the point cloud, enabling instance-specific geometric adjustments at the\\ninput level. Moreover, our proposed Prompt Propagation mechanism incorporates\\nthe shape information into the model's feature extraction process, further\\nstrengthening its ability to capture essential geometric characteristics.\\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that GAPrompt significantly outperforms\\nstate-of-the-art PEFT methods and achieves competitive results compared to full\\nfine-tuning on various benchmarks, while utilizing only 2.19% of trainable\\nparameters.
