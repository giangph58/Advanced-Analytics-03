Employing the Gaussian Process approach, we\\nobtain the SN Ia absolute magnitude and its derivative as a function of\\nredshift. The data set considered in the analysis comprises measurements of\\napparent magnitude from SN Ia, Hubble rate from cosmic chronometers, and the\\nratio between angular and radial distances from Large-Scale Structure data (BAO\\nand voids). Our findings reveal good compatibility between the reconstructed SN\\nIa absolute magnitudes and a constant value. However, the mean value obtained\\nfrom the Gaussian Process reconstruction is $M=-19.456\\\\pm 0.059$, which is\\n$3.2\\\\sigma$ apart from local measurements by Pantheon+SH0ES. This\\nincompatibility may be directly associated to the $\\\\Lambda$CDM model and local\\ndata, as it does not appear in either model-dependent or model-independent\\nestimates of the absolute magnitude based on early universe data. Furthermore,\\nwe assess the implications of a variable $M$ within the context of modified\\ngravity theories. Considering the local estimate of the absolute magnitude, we\\nfind $\\\\sim3\\\\sigma$ tension supporting departures from General Relativity in\\nanalyzing scenarios involving modified gravity theories with variations in\\nPlanck mass through Newton's constant.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T14:22:41Z\"}"}
