{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17581v1\", \"title\": \"A non-uniform metal distribution in the ram-pressure stripped M86 group\\n  of galaxies\", \"summary\": \"The chemical enrichment of X-ray-emitting hot halos has primarily been\\nstudied in closed-box galaxy clusters. Investigating the metal content of\\nlower-mass, open systems can serve as a valuable tracer for understanding their\\ndynamical history and the extent of chemical enrichment mechanisms in the\\nUniverse. In this context, we use an 85.6 ks XMM-Newton observation to study\\nthe spatial distribution of the abundance ratios of Mg, Si, and S with respect\\nto Fe in the hot gas of the ram-pressure-stripped M86, which has undergone\\nmorphological transformations. We report that the chemical composition in the\\nM86 galaxy core is more similar to the rest of the hot gaseous content of the\\nUniverse than to its stellar population. This result indicate that even extreme\\nsupersonic ram-pressure is insufficient to strip the inner part of a galaxy of\\nits hot atmosphere. Comparison with other galaxies undergoing ram-pressure\\nstripping suggests that stripping the \\\"primordial\\\" atmosphere of a galaxy\\nrequires a combination of ram-pressure stripping and strong radio-mechanical\\nAGN activity. The X-ray emission structures within M86, the plume and the tail,\\nare found to be relatively isothermal. We observe that the Mg/Fe ratio in the\\nplume is $3.3\\\\sigma$ higher than in the M86 galaxy core and is consistent with\\nthat in the M86 group outskirts and the Virgo ICM, suggesting that the plume\\nmight originate from the low-entropy group gas due to a galaxy-galaxy collision\\nrather than from the ram-pressure stripping of the dense galaxy core.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:11:13Z\"}"}
