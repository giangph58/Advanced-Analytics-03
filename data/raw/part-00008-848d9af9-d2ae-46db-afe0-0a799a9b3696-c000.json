{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05453v1\", \"title\": \"Conversational Process Model Redesign\", \"summary\": \"With the recent success of large language models (LLMs), the idea of\\nAI-augmented Business Process Management systems is becoming more feasible. One\\nof their essential characteristics is the ability to be conversationally\\nactionable, allowing humans to interact with the LLM effectively to perform\\ncrucial process life cycle tasks such as process model design and redesign.\\nHowever, most current research focuses on single-prompt execution and\\nevaluation of results, rather than on continuous interaction between the user\\nand the LLM. In this work, we aim to explore the feasibility of using LLMs to\\nempower domain experts in the creation and redesign of process models in an\\niterative and effective way. The proposed conversational process model redesign\\n(CPD) approach receives as input a process model and a redesign request by the\\nuser in natural language. Instead of just letting the LLM make changes, the LLM\\nis employed to (a) identify process change patterns from literature, (b)\\nre-phrase the change request to be aligned with an expected wording for the\\nidentified pattern (i.e., the meaning), and then to (c) apply the meaning of\\nthe change to the process model. This multi-step approach allows for\\nexplainable and reproducible changes. In order to ensure the feasibility of the\\nCPD approach, and to find out how well the patterns from literature can be\\nhandled by the LLM, we performed an extensive evaluation. The results show that\\nsome patterns are hard to understand by LLMs and by users. Within the scope of\\nthe study, we demonstrated that users need support to describe the changes\\nclearly. Overall the evaluation shows that the LLMs can handle most changes\\nwell according to a set of completeness and correctness criteria.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T17:44:45Z\"}"}
