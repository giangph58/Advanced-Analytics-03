{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06108v1\", \"title\": \"Characterizing direct and indirect causal effects when outcomes are\\n  dependent due to treatment spillover and outcome spillover\", \"summary\": \"We provide novel insight into causal inference when both treatment spillover\\nand outcome spillover occur in connected populations, by taking advantage of\\nrecent advances in statistical network analysis. Scenarios with treatment\\nspillover and outcome spillover are challenging, because both forms of\\nspillover affect outcomes and therefore treatment spillover and outcome\\nspillover are intertwined, and outcomes are dependent conditional on treatments\\nby virtue of outcome spillover. As a result, the direct and indirect causal\\neffects arising from spillover have remained black boxes: While the direct and\\nindirect causal effects can be identified, it is unknown how these causal\\neffects explicitly depend on the effects of treatment, treatment spillover, and\\noutcome spillover. We make three contributions, facilitated by low-rank random\\ninterference graphs. First, we provide novel insight into direct and indirect\\ncausal effects by disentangling the contributions of treatment, treatment\\nspillover, and outcome spillover. Second, we provide scalable estimators of\\ndirect and indirect causal effects. Third, we establish rates of convergence\\nfor estimators of direct and indirect causal effects. These are the first\\nconvergence rates in scenarios in which treatment spillover and outcome\\nspillover are intertwined and outcomes are dependent conditional on treatments,\\nand the interference graph is sparse or dense.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:55:34Z\"}"}
