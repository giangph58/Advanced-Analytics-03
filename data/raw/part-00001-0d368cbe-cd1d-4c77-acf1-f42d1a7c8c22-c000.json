Based on the calculated two-dimensional-projected energy maps and\\ndifferent potential-energy curves, we find that the highly even-order\\ndeformations have an important impact on both the fission trajectory and energy\\nminima, while the odd-order deformations, accompanying the even-order ones,\\nprimarily affect the fission path beyond the second barrier. Relative to the\\nlight actinide nuclei, nuclear ground state changes to the superdeformed\\nconfiguration but the normally-deformed minimum, as the low-energy shape\\nisomer, may still be primarily responsible for enhancing nuclear stability and\\nensuring experimental accessibility in $^{246,248}$No. Our present\\ninvestigation indicates the nonnegligible impact of high-order deformation\\neffects along the fission valley and will be helpful for deepening the\\nunderstandings of different deformation effects and deformation couplings in\\nnuclei, especially in this neutron-deficient heavy-mass region.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T10:49:33Z\"}"}
