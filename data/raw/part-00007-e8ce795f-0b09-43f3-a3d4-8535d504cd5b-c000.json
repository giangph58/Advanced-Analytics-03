We consider the case that the distribution of the\\nmeasurement error is unknown and allowed to be either ordinary or super smooth.\\nWe estimate the density of the measurement error by the repeated measurements\\nand propose the deconvolution kernel estimator for the CQRF. We derive the\\nuniform Bahadur representation of the proposed estimator and construct the\\nuniform confidence bands for the CQRF, uniformly in the sense for all\\ncovariates and a set of quantile indices, and establish the theoretical\\nvalidity of the proposed inference. A data-driven approach for selecting the\\ntuning parameter is also included. Monte Carlo simulations and a real data\\napplication demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,econ.EM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T14:16:39Z\"}"}
