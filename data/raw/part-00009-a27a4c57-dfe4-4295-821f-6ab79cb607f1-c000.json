{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04726v1\", \"title\": \"Can LLM-Driven Hard Negative Sampling Empower Collaborative Filtering?\\n  Findings and Potentials\", \"summary\": \"Hard negative samples can accelerate model convergence and optimize decision\\nboundaries, which is key to improving the performance of recommender systems.\\nAlthough large language models (LLMs) possess strong semantic understanding and\\ngeneration capabilities, systematic research has not yet been conducted on how\\nto generate hard negative samples effectively. To fill this gap, this paper\\nintroduces the concept of Semantic Negative Sampling and exploreshow to\\noptimize LLMs for high-quality, hard negative sampling. Specifically, we design\\nan experimental pipeline that includes three main modules, profile generation,\\nsemantic negative sampling, and semantic alignment, to verify the potential of\\nLLM-driven hard negative sampling in enhancing the accuracy of collaborative\\nfiltering (CF). Experimental results indicate that hard negative samples\\ngenerated based on LLMs, when semantically aligned and integrated into CF, can\\nsignificantly improve CF performance, although there is still a certain gap\\ncompared to traditional negative sampling methods. Further analysis reveals\\nthat this gap primarily arises from two major challenges: noisy samples and\\nlack of behavioral constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a\\nframework called HNLMRec, based on fine-tuning LLMs supervised by collaborative\\nsignals. Experimental results show that this framework outperforms traditional\\nnegative sampling and other LLM-driven recommendation methods across multiple\\ndatasets, providing new solutions for empowering traditional RS with LLMs.\\nAdditionally, we validate the excellent generalization ability of the LLM-based\\nsemantic negative sampling method on new datasets, demonstrating its potential\\nin alleviating issues such as data sparsity, popularity bias, and the problem\\nof false hard negative samples.
