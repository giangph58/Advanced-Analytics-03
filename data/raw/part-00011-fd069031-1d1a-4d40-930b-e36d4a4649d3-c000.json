{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21818v1\", \"title\": \"Topology, Kinetics and Inheritance in Clonal Colonies of Bone Marrow\\n  Stromal Cells\", \"summary\": \"Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), whose populations contain multipotent\\nskeletal stem cells with relevant therapeutic applications, are known to\\nproduce very heterogeneous colonies upon in vitro culture, a trait that may\\nseverely hinder the clinical usefulness of BMSC-based therapies. Therefore,\\nreaching a better insight on the nature of such heterogeneity, as well as on\\nthe factors determining it, is important. Here, by using time-lapse microscopy,\\nwe study the structure of N=28 human BMSC colonies from six donors, each colony\\nderived from a single cell, and trace their lineage trees up to the seventh\\ngeneration. We confirm the presence of very significant inter-colony and\\nintra-colony heterogeneities, both in the topology of the lineages and in the\\nreplicative kinetics of the colonies. We also find that topology and kinetics\\nare strongly correlated, consistent with the existence of regulating factors\\nlinking the sub-population of inactive cells, which uniquely determine a\\nlineage's topology, and that of active cells, which are the sole responsible\\nfor the proliferation rate of the colony. Finally, we submit each colony to an\\nentropy-based inheritance test, which measures the degree of non-random\\nclustering of inactive cells within the same branches of the lineage, and find\\na clear signature of hereditary transmission of the probability of emergence of\\ninactive cells in the largest majority of the experimental lineages.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.CB\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.CB,cond-mat.stat-mech,physics.bio-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:24:21Z\"}"}
