In the\\npresent work, the electron and proton transfer dynamics driven by a femtosecond\\npump pulse and a time-delayed femtosecond push pulse has been studied with ab\\ninitio on-the-fly nonadiabatic trajectory calculations for the hydrogen-bonded\\nheptazine-H2O complex. While the dynamics following the pump pulse is dominated\\nby ultrafast radiationless energy relaxation to the long-lived lowest singlet\\nexcited state (S1) of the heptazine chromophore with only minor PCET\\nreactivity, the re-excitation of the transient S1 population by the push pulse\\nresults in a much higher PCET reaction probability. These results illustrate\\nthat pump-push excitation has the potential to unravel the individual electron\\nand proton transfer processes of PCET reactions on femtosecond time scales.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T09:24:29Z\"}"}
