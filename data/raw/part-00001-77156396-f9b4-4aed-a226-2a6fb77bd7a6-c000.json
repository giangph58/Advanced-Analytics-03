This effect opens up a new window for small\\nprimordial black holes (PBHs) below $10^{15}\\\\,{\\\\rm g}$ as dark matter. We show\\nthat the smooth transition from semi-classical evaporation to the\\nmemory-burdened phase strongly impacts observational bounds on the abundance of\\nsmall PBHs. The most stringent constraints come from present-day fluxes of\\nastrophysical particles. Remarkably, currently-transitioning small PBHs are\\ndetectable through high-energetic neutrino events.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.HE,gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:51:05Z\"}"}
