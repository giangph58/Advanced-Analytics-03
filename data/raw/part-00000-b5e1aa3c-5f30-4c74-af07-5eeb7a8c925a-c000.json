{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11437v1\", \"title\": \"Ghostly interactions in (1+1) dimensional classical field theory\", \"summary\": \"We investigate the classical stability of two coupled scalar fields with\\nopposite-sign kinetic terms evolving in 1+1 dimensional Minkowski spacetime. In\\nthe first part, we characterise unquenched ghostly interactions and present\\nnumerical solutions that support the following statements. First, the classical\\ninstability is not instantaneous and can even be benign, i.e., free of\\nfinite-time singularities. Second, while the classical instability can cascade\\ntowards higher frequency excitations, it is not driven by high frequency modes:\\nAt fixed amplitude, high-frequency modes are more stable than low-frequency\\nmodes. In the second part, we demonstrate that the classical instability can be\\nquenched by mass terms. In particular, we exemplify that heavy high-frequency\\nghost fields seem to not violate the decoupling theorem and can be integrated\\nout classically. In the third part, we demonstrate how self-interactions can\\nquench the instability, for instance, by postponing its onset to parametrically\\nlarge times. Extrapolating numerical results at large but finite evolution time\\nto infinite evolution time, we demonstrate that classical fluctuations around\\ntrivial and nontrivial field-theory vacua are increasingly long-lived with (i)\\nsmaller initial amplitude of fluctuations, (ii) higher initial frequency of\\nfluctuations, (iii) larger masses of the fields, or (iv) weaker interaction\\ncoupling. Moreover, our numerical simulations for field-theoretical\\ngeneralisations of some globally-stable ghostly mechanical models do not\\nfeature any instability.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T17:53:00Z\"}"}
