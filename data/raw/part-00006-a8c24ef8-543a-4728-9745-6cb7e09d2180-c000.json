{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09920v1\", \"title\": \"Strain Engineering of Magnetoresistance and Magnetic Anisotropy in CrSBr\", \"summary\": \"Tailoring magnetoresistance and magnetic anisotropy in van der Waals magnetic\\nmaterials is essential for advancing their integration into technological\\napplications. In this regard, strain engineering has emerged as a powerful and\\nversatile strategy to control magnetism at the two-dimensional (2D) limit.\\nHere, we demonstrate that compressive biaxial strain significantly enhances the\\nmagnetoresistance and magnetic anisotropy of few-layer CrSBr flakes. Strain is\\nefficiently transferred to the flakes from the thermal compression of a\\npolymeric substrate upon cooling, as confirmed by temperature-dependent Raman\\nspectroscopy. This strain induces a remarkable increase in the\\nmagnetoresistance ratio and in the saturation fields required to align the\\nmagnetization of CrSBr along each of its three crystalographic directions,\\nreaching a twofold enhancement along the magnetic easy axis. This enhancement\\nis accompanied by a subtle reduction of the N\\\\'eel temperature by ~10K. Our\\nexperimental results are fully supported by first-principles calculations,\\nwhich link the observed effects to a strain-driven modification in interlayer\\nexchange coupling and magnetic anisotropy energy. These findings establish\\nstrain engineering as a key tool for fine-tuning magnetotransport properties in\\n2D magnetic semiconductors, paving the way for implementation in spintronics\\nand information storage devices.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.mes-hall,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T06:27:26Z\"}"}
