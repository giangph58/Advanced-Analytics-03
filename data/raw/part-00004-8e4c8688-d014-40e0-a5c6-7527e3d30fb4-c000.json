The analysis explores this property\\nacross different rapidity ranges, collision centralities, and collision\\nenergies, while also examining the roles of multi-parton interactions (MPI) and\\ncolor reconnection (CR) mechanisms. The results show that the light nuclei\\nyield ratio remains stable with changes in rapidity coverage and collision\\ncentrality but slightly increases with rising collision energy. The impact of\\nCR on the light nuclei yield ratio depends entirely on the presence of MPI;\\nwhen MPI is turned off, CR has no effect. Additionally, the three-nucleon\\ncorrelation, enhances the light nuclei yield ratio in both central and\\nperipheral collisions. However, the non-monotonic energy dependence observed in\\nexperiments, the peak at $\\\\sqrt{s_{\\\\rm NN}}$ = $20\\\\sim30$ GeV reported by the\\nSTAR experiment, cannot be explained by the Angantyr model due to its lack of\\nkey mechanisms related to the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Nevertheless, the\\nAngantyr model serves as an important baseline for studying collision behaviors\\nin the absence of QGP effects.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T09:26:28Z\"}"}
