To mitigate this issue, a fault detection method employing the\\n$H_{\\\\infty}$ filter is proposed. The $H_{\\\\infty}$ filter is first derived as\\nthe solution to a regularized least-squares (RLS) optimization problem, and the\\neffect of faults on the output prediction error is then analyzed. The proposed\\napproach using the $H_{\\\\infty}$ filter demonstrates robustness in non-Gaussian\\nnoise environments and significantly improves fault detection performance\\ncompared to the original GLR method that employs the Kalman filter. The\\neffectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated using numerical examples.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:18:31Z\"}"}
