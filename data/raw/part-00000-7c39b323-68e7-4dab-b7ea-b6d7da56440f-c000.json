Recently, two-dimensional (2D) materials\\n- characterized by their atomic thinness and external controllability - have\\nemerged as promising candidates for qubit fabrication and manipulation at room\\ntemperature. In this study, we propose that antisite defects (MX) in 2D\\ntransition metal disulfides (TMDs) can serve as tunable quantum defects with\\ncontrolled positioning. Using first-principles atomic structure simulations, we\\nidentify six thermodynamically stable neutral antisite defects (MX, where M =\\nMg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Zn, Cd; X = S) in monolayer 1H-MoS2. These defects exhibit\\npotential as spin-defected qubits with stable triplet ground states.\\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that the reduction of the bandgap leads to\\nsignificant fluctuations in the absorption coefficient within the low-energy\\nrange, resulting in the optical response within the desired telecommunication\\nband, which is advantageous for quantum communication applications. The\\nzero-phonon line (ZPL) associated with these qubits can serve as an effective\\nidentifier. This work presents the novel, tunable approach to exploiting\\ndefects in 2D materials, opening new possibilities for the development of qubit\\nplatforms in quantum information technology.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:46:16Z\"}"}
