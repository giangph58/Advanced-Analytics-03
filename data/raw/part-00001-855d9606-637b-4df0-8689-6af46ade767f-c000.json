{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05137v1\", \"title\": \"BoxSeg: Quality-Aware and Peer-Assisted Learning for Box-supervised\\n  Instance Segmentation\", \"summary\": \"Box-supervised instance segmentation methods aim to achieve instance\\nsegmentation with only box annotations. Recent methods have demonstrated the\\neffectiveness of acquiring high-quality pseudo masks under the teacher-student\\nframework. Building upon this foundation, we propose a BoxSeg framework\\ninvolving two novel and general modules named the Quality-Aware Module (QAM)\\nand the Peer-assisted Copy-paste (PC). The QAM obtains high-quality pseudo\\nmasks and better measures the mask quality to help reduce the effect of noisy\\nmasks, by leveraging the quality-aware multi-mask complementation mechanism.\\nThe PC imitates Peer-Assisted Learning to further improve the quality of the\\nlow-quality masks with the guidance of the obtained high-quality pseudo masks.\\nTheoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate the proposed QAM and PC are\\neffective. Extensive experimental results show the superiority of our BoxSeg\\nover the state-of-the-art methods, and illustrate the QAM and PC can be applied\\nto improve other models.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:42:33Z\"}"}
