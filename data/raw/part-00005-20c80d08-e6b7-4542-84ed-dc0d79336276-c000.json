Type II\\nfluctuations differ from type I by the presence of a stationary point on the\\ninitial time slice, when we see the areal radius as a function of the radial\\ncoordinate. Starting from these type II perturbations to form black holes, the\\nnonlinear evolution governed by the Einstein equations generally results in two\\ndistinct types, A and B, of horizon configurations, respectively characterized\\nby the absence and presence of a bifurcating trapping horizon where past and\\nfuture trapping horizons meet. In this paper, we use the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi\\nsolution to show that type I/II and type A/B classifications are equivalent for\\na spherically symmetric dust fluid system, regardless of the fluctuation\\nprofile. However, this equivalence does not generally hold in the presence of\\npressure.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T07:37:06Z\"}"}
