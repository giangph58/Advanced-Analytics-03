{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03585v1\", \"title\": \"Decision Making under Model Misspecification: DRO with Robust Bayesian\\n  Ambiguity Sets\", \"summary\": \"Distributionally Robust Optimisation (DRO) protects risk-averse\\ndecision-makers by considering the worst-case risk within an ambiguity set of\\ndistributions based on the empirical distribution or a model. To further guard\\nagainst finite, noisy data, model-based approaches admit Bayesian formulations\\nthat propagate uncertainty from the posterior to the decision-making problem.\\nHowever, when the model is misspecified, the decision maker must stretch the\\nambiguity set to contain the data-generating process (DGP), leading to overly\\nconservative decisions. We address this challenge by introducing DRO with\\nRobust, to model misspecification, Bayesian Ambiguity Sets (DRO-RoBAS). These\\nare Maximum Mean Discrepancy ambiguity sets centred at a robust posterior\\npredictive distribution that incorporates beliefs about the DGP. We show that\\nthe resulting optimisation problem obtains a dual formulation in the\\nReproducing Kernel Hilbert Space and we give probabilistic guarantees on the\\ntolerance level of the ambiguity set. Our method outperforms other Bayesian and\\nempirical DRO approaches in out-of-sample performance on the Newsvendor and\\nPortfolio problems with various cases of model misspecification.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ML\", \"categories\": \"stat.ML,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T14:46:16Z\"}"}
