This side condition bounds the oscillation of a weight on the top\\nhalves of Carleson squares and allows for the development of a rich theory for\\nB\\\\'ekoll\\\\'e-Bonami weights, analogous to that of Muckenhoupt weights. First, we\\nprove that the side condition can essentially be dropped when the weight is\\nradial and monotonic. Then, by means of counterexamples, we show that the side\\ncondition is sharp for non-monotonic weights. In addition, we extend the\\ncharacterization of the $B_\\\\infty$ class so that it includes all twelve\\n$A_\\\\infty$ conditions recently studied by Duoandikoetxea, Mart\\\\'in-Reyes and\\nOmbrosi, and we present a complete picture of the relationships between these\\ntwelve conditions for arbitrary weights on the unit disc. Finally, we use our\\nresults to prove an analogue of the self-improvement property of Muckenhoupt\\nweights for monotonic B\\\\'ekoll\\\\'e-Bonami weights.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CA\", \"categories\": \"math.CA,math.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:44:59Z\"}"}
