We define a\\nboundary energy-momentum tensor by varying the on-shell action with respect to\\nthe Carroll metric data. This requires adding counterterms to the\\nEinstein-Hilbert action. We show that, in 4D, the shear is on par with the\\nCarroll metric data. Their combined response defines a boundary\\nenergy-momentum-news complex whose diffeomorphism Ward identity is equivalent\\nto the Bondi mass and angular momentum loss equations. Weyl invariance leads to\\nan identity for the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, and local Carroll\\nboosts are anomalous in 3D and in 4D.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T17:22:02Z\"}"}
