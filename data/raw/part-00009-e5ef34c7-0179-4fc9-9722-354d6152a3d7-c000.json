{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12750v1\", \"title\": \"Spatial Functional Deep Neural Network Model: A New Prediction Algorithm\", \"summary\": \"Accurate prediction of spatially dependent functional data is critical for\\nvarious engineering and scientific applications. In this study, a spatial\\nfunctional deep neural network model was developed with a novel non-linear\\nmodeling framework that seamlessly integrates spatial dependencies and\\nfunctional predictors using deep learning techniques. The proposed model\\nextends classical scalar-on-function regression by incorporating a spatial\\nautoregressive component while leveraging functional deep neural networks to\\ncapture complex non-linear relationships. To ensure a robust estimation, the\\nmethodology employs an adaptive estimation approach, where the spatial\\ndependence parameter was first inferred via maximum likelihood estimation,\\nfollowed by non-linear functional regression using deep learning. The\\neffectiveness of the proposed model was evaluated through extensive Monte Carlo\\nsimulations and an application to Brazilian COVID-19 data, where the goal was\\nto predict the average daily number of deaths. Comparative analysis with\\nmaximum likelihood-based spatial functional linear regression and functional\\ndeep neural network models demonstrates that the proposed algorithm\\nsignificantly improves predictive performance. The results for the Brazilian\\nCOVID-19 data showed that while all models achieved similar mean squared error\\nvalues over the training modeling phase, the proposed model achieved the lowest\\nmean squared prediction error in the testing phase, indicating superior\\ngeneralization ability.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T08:44:29Z\"}"}
