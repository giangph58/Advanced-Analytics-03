These models represent an\\nimportant model class with a large number of applications in areas ranging from\\ntransport in biological cells to the motion of human crowds. While traditional\\nnumerical schemes require a large amount of tailoring, especially in the case\\nof model design or parameter identification problems, physics informed deep\\noperator networks (DeepONet) have emerged as a versatile tool for the solution\\nof partial differential equations with the particular advantage that they\\neasily incorporate parameter identification questions. We here present an\\napproach where we first learn three DeepONet models for representative inflow,\\ninner and outflow edges, resp., and then subsequently couple these models for\\nthe solution of the drift-diffusion metric graph problem by relying on an\\nedge-based domain decomposition approach. We illustrate that our framework is\\napplicable for the accurate evaluation of graph-coupled physics models and is\\nwell suited for solving optimization or inverse problems on these coupled\\nnetworks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.NA,math.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T09:13:00Z\"}"}
