{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17569v1\", \"title\": \"Flying through cluttered and dynamic environments with LiDAR\", \"summary\": \"Navigating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) through cluttered and dynamic\\nenvironments remains a significant challenge, particularly when dealing with\\nfast-moving or sudden-appearing obstacles. This paper introduces a complete\\nLiDAR-based system designed to enable UAVs to avoid various moving obstacles in\\ncomplex environments. Benefiting the high computational efficiency of\\nperception and planning, the system can operate in real time using onboard\\ncomputing resources with low latency. For dynamic environment perception, we\\nhave integrated our previous work, M-detector, into the system. M-detector\\nensures that moving objects of different sizes, colors, and types are reliably\\ndetected. For dynamic environment planning, we incorporate dynamic object\\npredictions into the integrated planning and control (IPC) framework, namely\\nDynIPC. This integration allows the UAV to utilize predictions about dynamic\\nobstacles to effectively evade them. We validate our proposed system through\\nboth simulations and real-world experiments. In simulation tests, our system\\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines across several metrics, including\\nsuccess rate, time consumption, average flight time, and maximum velocity. In\\nreal-world trials, our system successfully navigates through forests, avoiding\\nmoving obstacles along its path.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T13:59:06Z\"}"}
