In this paper, we study\\nthe following Ramsey version of these problems. Given a set $L\\\\subseteq\\n\\\\{0,\\\\dots,k-1\\\\}$ and a family $\\\\mathcal{F}$ of $k$-element sets which does not\\ncontain a sunflower with $m$ petals whose kernel size is in $L$, how large a\\nsubfamily of $\\\\mathcal{F}$ can we find in which no pair has intersection size\\nin $L$? We give matching upper and lower bounds, determining the dependence on\\n$m$ for all $k$ and $L$. This problem also finds applications in quantum\\ncomputing.\\n  As an application of our techniques, we also obtain a variant of F\\\\\\\"uredi's\\ncelebrated semilattice lemma, which is a key tool in the powerful delta-system\\nmethod. We prove that one cannot remove the double-exponential dependency on\\nthe uniformity in F\\\\\\\"uredi's result, however, we provide an alternative with\\nsignificantly better, single-exponential dependency on the parameters, which is\\nstill strong enough for most applications of the delta-system method.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,cs.DM,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T17:46:21Z\"}"}
