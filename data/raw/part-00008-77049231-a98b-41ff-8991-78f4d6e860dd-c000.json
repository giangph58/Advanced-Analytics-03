{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19835v1\", \"title\": \"Automated Generation of Precedence Graphs in Digital Value Chains for\\n  Automotive Production\", \"summary\": \"This study examines the digital value chain in automotive manufacturing,\\nfocusing on the identification, software flashing, customization, and\\ncommissioning of electronic control units in vehicle networks. A novel\\nprecedence graph design is proposed to optimize this process chain using an\\nautomated scheduling algorithm that employs mixed integer linear programming\\ntechniques. The results show significant improvements in key metrics. The\\nalgorithm reduces the number of production stations equipped with expensive\\nhardware and software to execute digital value chain processes, while\\nincreasing capacity utilization through efficient scheduling and reduced idle\\ntime. Task parallelization is optimized, resulting in streamlined workflows and\\nincreased throughput. Compared to the traditional method, the automated\\napproach has reduced preparation time by 50% and reduced scheduling activities,\\nas it now takes two minutes to create the precedence graph. The flexibility of\\nthe algorithm's constraints allows for vehicle-specific configurations while\\nmaintaining high responsiveness, eliminating backup stations and facilitating\\nthe integration of new topologies. Automated scheduling significantly\\noutperforms manual methods in efficiency, functionality, and adaptability.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:37:06Z\"}"}
