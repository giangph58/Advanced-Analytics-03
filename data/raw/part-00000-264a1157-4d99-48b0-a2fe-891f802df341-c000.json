With deaths and trauma already being blamed on LLMs, this\\nuncertainty is even pushing people to treat their 'pet' LLM more politely to\\n'dissuade' it (or its future Artificial General Intelligence offspring) from\\nsuddenly turning on them. Here we address this acute need by deriving from\\nfirst principles an exact formula for when a Jekyll-and-Hyde tipping point\\noccurs at LLMs' most basic level. Requiring only secondary school mathematics,\\nit shows the cause to be the AI's attention spreading so thin it suddenly\\nsnaps. This exact formula provides quantitative predictions for how the\\ntipping-point can be delayed or prevented by changing the prompt and the AI's\\ntraining. Tailored generalizations will provide policymakers and the public\\nwith a firm platform for discussing any of AI's broader uses and risks, e.g. as\\na personal counselor, medical advisor, decision-maker for when to use force in\\na conflict situation. It also meets the need for clear and transparent answers\\nto questions like ''should I be polite to my LLM?''\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.CY,nlin.AO,physics.comp-ph,physics.soc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:50:29Z\"}"}
