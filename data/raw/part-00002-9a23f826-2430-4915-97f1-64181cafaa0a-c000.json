However,\\nensuring they do not recommend out-of-domain (OOD) items remains a challenge.\\nWe study two distinct methods to address this issue: RecLM-ret, a\\nretrieval-based method, and RecLM-cgen, a constrained generation method. Both\\nmethods integrate seamlessly with existing LLMs to ensure in-domain\\nrecommendations. Comprehensive experiments on three recommendation datasets\\ndemonstrate that RecLM-cgen consistently outperforms RecLM-ret and existing\\nLLM-based recommender models in accuracy while eliminating OOD recommendations,\\nmaking it the preferred method for adoption. Additionally, RecLM-cgen maintains\\nstrong generalist capabilities and is a lightweight plug-and-play module for\\neasy integration into LLMs, offering valuable practical benefits for the\\ncommunity.
