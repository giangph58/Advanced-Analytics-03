Nevertheless, there\\nis still no continuum mechanical model capable of describing the evolution of\\nsuch damage. In this study, we develop a model that characterizes solid damage\\nthrough a phase field variable governed by Allen-Cahn dynamics. The parameter\\nof the model is defined by a conceptual mechanism: during Coulomb explosion,\\nelectron pressure surpasses the interatomic barrier potential, dissociates\\nmaterial from the solid surface as small equivalent particles and resulting in\\nlocalized damage. The numerical simulation validates the model's availability\\nand demonstrate its ability to predict damage morphology under varying laser\\nconditions. This work advances the understanding of non-thermal ablation and\\nprovides a tool for optimizing ultrafast laser processing.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,cond-mat.other,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T09:16:41Z\"}"}
