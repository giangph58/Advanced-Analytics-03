For highly-bonded\\nsystems, it is entropy that mostly determines if, on increasing concentration,\\nthe network forms progressively or \\\\textit{via} a first-order transition. With\\nthe aim of introducing an experimentally-viable system tailored to test the\\nsubtle dependence of the phase behavior on the binding site topology, here we\\nnumerically investigate AP polymers made of DNA, where \\\"sticker\\\" sites made by\\nshort DNA sequences are interspersed in a flexible backbone of poly-T spacers.\\nDue to their self-complementarity, each binding sequence can associate with\\nanother identical sticky sequence. We compare two architectures: one with a\\nsingle sticker type, $(AA)_6$, and one with two distinct alternating types,\\n$(AB)_6$. At low temperature, when most of the stickers are involved in a bond,\\nthe $(AA)_6$ system remains homogeneous, while the $(AB)_6$ system exhibits\\nphase separation, driven primarily by entropic factors, mirroring predictions\\nfrom simpler bead-spring models. Analysis of bond distributions and polymer\\nconformations confirms that the predominantly entropic driving force behind\\nthis separation arises from the different topological constraints associated\\nwith intra- versus inter-molecular bonding. Our results establish DNA APs as a\\ncontrollable, realistic platform for studying in the laboratory how the\\nthermodynamics of associative polymer networks depends on the bonding site\\narchitecture in a clean and controlled way.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:52:27Z\"}"}
