Domestic\\nservice robots with monitoring capabilities can enhance safety and provide\\nessential support. Although image-based methods have advanced considerably in\\nthe past decade, their adoption remains limited by concerns over privacy and\\nsensitivity to low-light or dark conditions. As an alternative, millimetre-wave\\n(mmWave) radar can produce point cloud data which is privacy-preserving.\\nHowever, processing the sparse and noisy point clouds remains a long-standing\\nchallenge. While graph-based methods and attention mechanisms show promise,\\nthey predominantly rely on \\\"fixed\\\" kernels; kernels that are applied uniformly\\nacross all neighbourhoods, highlighting the need for adaptive approaches that\\ncan dynamically adjust their kernels to the specific geometry of each local\\nneighbourhood in point cloud data. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an\\nadaptive approach within the graph convolutional framework. Instead of a single\\nshared weight function, our Multi-Head Adaptive Kernel (MAK) module generates\\nmultiple dynamic kernels, each capturing different aspects of the local feature\\nspace. By progressively refining local features while maintaining global\\nspatial context, our method enables convolution kernels to adapt to varying\\nlocal features. Experimental results on benchmark datasets confirm the\\neffectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance in human\\nactivity recognition.
