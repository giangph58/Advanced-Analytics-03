{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09903v1\", \"title\": \"Refining Financial Consumer Complaints through Multi-Scale Model\\n  Interaction\", \"summary\": \"Legal writing demands clarity, formality, and domain-specific\\nprecision-qualities often lacking in documents authored by individuals without\\nlegal training. To bridge this gap, this paper explores the task of legal text\\nrefinement that transforms informal, conversational inputs into persuasive\\nlegal arguments. We introduce FinDR, a Chinese dataset of financial dispute\\nrecords, annotated with official judgments on claim reasonableness. Our\\nproposed method, Multi-Scale Model Interaction (MSMI), leverages a lightweight\\nclassifier to evaluate outputs and guide iterative refinement by Large Language\\nModels (LLMs). Experimental results demonstrate that MSMI significantly\\noutperforms single-pass prompting strategies. Additionally, we validate the\\ngeneralizability of MSMI on several short-text benchmarks, showing improved\\nadversarial robustness. Our findings reveal the potential of multi-model\\ncollaboration for enhancing legal document generation and broader text\\nrefinement tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T05:51:31Z\"}"}
