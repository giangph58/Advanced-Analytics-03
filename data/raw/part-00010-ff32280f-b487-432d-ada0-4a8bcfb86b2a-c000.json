{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11200v1\", \"title\": \"Mutual Understanding between People and Systems via Neurosymbolic AI and\\n  Knowledge Graphs\", \"summary\": \"This chapter investigates the concept of mutual understanding between humans\\nand systems, positing that Neuro-symbolic Artificial Intelligence (NeSy AI)\\nmethods can significantly enhance this mutual understanding by leveraging\\nexplicit symbolic knowledge representations with data-driven learning models.\\nWe start by introducing three critical dimensions to characterize mutual\\nunderstanding: sharing knowledge, exchanging knowledge, and governing\\nknowledge. Sharing knowledge involves aligning the conceptual models of\\ndifferent agents to enable a shared understanding of the domain of interest.\\nExchanging knowledge relates to ensuring the effective and accurate\\ncommunication between agents. Governing knowledge concerns establishing rules\\nand processes to regulate the interaction between agents. Then, we present\\nseveral different use case scenarios that demonstrate the application of NeSy\\nAI and Knowledge Graphs to aid meaningful exchanges between human, artificial,\\nand robotic agents. These scenarios highlight both the potential and the\\nchallenges of combining top-down symbolic reasoning with bottom-up neural\\nlearning, guiding the discussion of the coverage provided by current solutions\\nalong the dimensions of sharing, exchanging, and governing knowledge.\\nConcurrently, this analysis facilitates the identification of gaps and less\\ndeveloped aspects in mutual understanding to address in future research.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T13:57:09Z\"}"}
