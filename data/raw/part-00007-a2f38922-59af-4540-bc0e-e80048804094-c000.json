Advances in neutron powder diffraction experiments and analysis\\ntools now allow for quantitative determination. We demonstrate this here with\\ncomplementary total neutron scattering and polarized neutron measurements on\\nthe HB-2A neutron powder diffractometer at the High Flux Isotope Reactor\\n(HFIR). In recent years, magnetic pair distribution function (mPDF) analysis\\nhas emerged as a powerful technique for probing local magnetic spin ordering of\\nmagnetic materials. This method can be broadly applied to any magnetic material\\nbut is particularly effective for studying systems with short-range magnetic\\norder, such as materials with reduced dimensionality, geometrically frustrated\\nmagnets, thermoelectrics, multiferroics, and correlated paramagnets. Magnetic\\nanisotropy often underpins the short-range order adopted. Half-polarized\\nneutron powder diffraction (pNPD) can be used to determine the local\\nsusceptibility tensor on the magnetic sites to quantify the magnetic\\nanisotropy. Combining the techniques of mPDF and pNPD can therefore provide\\nvaluable insights into local magnetic behavior. A series of measurements\\noptimized for these techniques are presented as exemplar cases focused on\\nfrustrated materials where short-range order dominates, these include\\nmeasurements to ultra-low temperature (<100 mK) not typically accessible for\\nsuch experiments.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T14:16:08Z\"}"}
