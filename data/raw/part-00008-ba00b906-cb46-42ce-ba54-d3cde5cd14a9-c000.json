We extend this notion and the combinatorial bounds of Theorem 2 in\\nHeintz (1983) using the degree for constructible sets defined in\\nPardo-Sebasti\\\\'an (2022). We show that the Erzeugungsgrad is the key ingredient\\nto connect affine Intersection Theory over algebraically closed fields and the\\nVC-Theory of Computational Learning Theory for families of classifiers given by\\nparameterized families of constructible sets. In particular, we prove that the\\nVC-dimension and the Krull dimension are linearly related up to logarithmic\\nfactors based on Intersection Theory. Using this relation, we study the density\\nof correct test sequences in evasive varieties. We apply these ideas to analyze\\nparameterized families of neural networks with rational activation function.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:16:38Z\"}"}
