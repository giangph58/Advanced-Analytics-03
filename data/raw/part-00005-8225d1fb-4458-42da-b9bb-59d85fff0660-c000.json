However, it is\\nchallenging to control the interfacial structures since they are decided by the\\nmost stable atomic bonding. In this work, we report strong tunability of the\\nepitaxial interface of improper ferroelectric hexagonal ferrites deposited on\\nspinel ferrites. The selection of two interface types, related by a 90 deg\\nrotation of in-plane epitaxial relations and featured by disordered and\\nhybridized reconstructions respectively, can be achieved by growth conditions,\\nstacking sequences, and spinel compositions. While the disordered type\\nsuppresses the primary K3 structure distortion and ferroelectricity in\\nhexagonal ferrites, the hybridized type is more coherent with the distortion\\nwith minimal suppression. This tunable interfacial structure provides critical\\ninsight on controlling interfacial clamping and may offer a solution for the\\nlong-standing problem of practical critical thickness in improper\\nferroelectrics.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:13:20Z\"}"}
