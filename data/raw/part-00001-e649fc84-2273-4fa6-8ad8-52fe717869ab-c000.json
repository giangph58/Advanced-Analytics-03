Real-world\\napplications, such as time division multiple access (TDMA) scheduling for\\nwireless multi-hop networks and financial trading, require solving those\\nproblems sequentially where the size and characteristics change dynamically.\\nHowever, using Ising machines involves challenges to shorten system-wide\\nlatency due to the transfer of large Ising model or the cloud access and to\\ndetermine the parameters for each problem. Here we show a combinatorial\\noptimization method using embedded Ising machines, which enables solving\\ndiverse problems at high speed without runtime parameter tuning. We customize\\nthe algorithm and circuit architecture of the simulated bifurcation-based Ising\\nmachine to compress the Ising model and accelerate computation and then built a\\nmachine learning model to estimate appropriate parameters using extensive\\ntraining data. In TDMA scheduling for wireless multi-hop networks, our\\ndemonstration has shown that the sophisticated system can adapt to changes in\\nthe problem and showed that it has a speed advantage over conventional methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.ET\", \"categories\": \"cs.ET,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T11:31:36Z\"}"}
