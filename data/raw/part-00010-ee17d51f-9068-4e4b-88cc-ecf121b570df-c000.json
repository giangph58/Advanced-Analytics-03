Under a novel stochastic formulation of cost-controllability\\nand detectability assumptions inspired by the related literature on\\ndeterministic systems, we prove that uniform semi-global practical recurrence\\nholds for the closed-loop system, where the adjustable parameter is the\\ndiscount factor. Under additional continuity assumptions, we further prove that\\nthis property is robust.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T12:36:32Z\"}"}
