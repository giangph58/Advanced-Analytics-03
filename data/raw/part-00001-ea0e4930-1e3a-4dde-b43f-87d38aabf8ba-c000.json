{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23974v1\", \"title\": \"Revealing the Low Temperature Phase of FAPbI$_3$ using Machine-Learned\\n  Potential\", \"summary\": \"FAPbI$_3$ is a material of interest for its potential in solar cell\\napplications, driven by its remarkable optoelectronic properties. However, the\\nlow-temperature phase of FAPbI$_3$ remains poorly understood, with open\\nquestions surrounding its crystal structure, octahedral tilting, and the\\narrangement of formamidinium (FA) cations. Using our trained machine-learned\\npotential in combination with large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we\\nprovide a detailed investigation of this phase, uncovering its structural\\ncharacteristics and dynamical behavior. Our analysis reveals the octahedral\\ntilt pattern and sheds light on the rotational dynamics of FA cations in the\\nlow temperature phase. Strikingly, we find that the FA cations become frozen in\\na metastable configuration, unable to reach the thermodynamic ground state. By\\ncomparing our simulated results with experimental nuclear magnetic resonance\\n(NMR) and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectra, we demonstrate good\\nagreement, further validating our findings. This phenomenon mirrors\\nexperimental observations and offers a compelling explanation for the\\nexperimental challenges in accessing the true ground state. These findings\\nprovide critical insights into the fundamental physics of FAPbI$_3$ and its\\nlow-temperature behavior, advancing our understanding of this technologically\\nimportant material.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T11:36:16Z\"}"}
