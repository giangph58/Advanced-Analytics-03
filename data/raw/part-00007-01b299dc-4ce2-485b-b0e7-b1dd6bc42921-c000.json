We show that cubic\\ngravitational couplings, constrained by the spatial diffeomorphism invariance,\\nlead to infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) divergences in the decoherence rate\\nat one loop. These divergences arise from fluctuations of deep IR modes which\\nlook like a background mode for a local observer and violent zero-point\\nfluctuations in the deep UV, respectively. We argue that these divergences are\\nunobservable, as they vanish when considering proper observables. We consider\\ncorrelators defined using the geodesic distance for IR divergences and\\ntime-averaged correlators for UV divergences. To account for these observer's\\nperspectives, we propose to consider an effective quantum state, defined in\\nterms of actual observables, as a more appropriate probe of the quantum\\ncoherence of the system measured by an observer. We then evaluate the finite\\ndecoherence rate induced by superhorizon environment during inflation and at\\nlate universe.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:54:35Z\"}"}
