{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11064v1\", \"title\": \"A Multi-UAV Formation Obstacle Avoidance Method Combined Improved\\n  Simulated Annealing and Adaptive Artificial Potential Field\", \"summary\": \"The traditional Artificial Potential Field (APF) method exhibits limitations\\nin its force distribution: excessive attraction when UAVs are far from the\\ntarget may cause collisions with obstacles, while insufficient attraction near\\nthe goal often results in failure to reach the target. Furthermore, APF is\\nhighly susceptible to local minima, compromising motion reliability in complex\\nenvironments. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel hybrid\\nobstacle avoidance algorithm-Deflected Simulated Annealing-Adaptive Artificial\\nPotential Field (DSA-AAPF)-which combines an improved simulated annealing\\nmechanism with an enhanced APF model. The proposed approach integrates a\\nLeader-Follower distributed formation strategy with the APF framework, where\\nthe resultant force formulation is redefined to smooth UAV trajectories. An\\nadaptive gravitational gain function is introduced to dynamically adjust UAV\\nvelocity based on environmental context, and a fast-converging controller\\nensures accurate and efficient convergence to the target. Moreover, a\\ndirectional deflection mechanism is embedded within the simulated annealing\\nprocess, enabling UAVs to escape local minima caused by semi-enclosed obstacles\\nthrough continuous rotational motion. The simulation results, covering\\nformation reconfiguration, complex obstacle avoidance, and entrapment escape,\\ndemonstrate the feasibility, robustness, and superiority of the proposed\\nDSA-AAPF algorithm.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MA\", \"categories\": \"cs.MA,cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T10:53:51Z\"}"}
