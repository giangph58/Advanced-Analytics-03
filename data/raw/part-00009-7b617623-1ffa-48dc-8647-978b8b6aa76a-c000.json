In this approach,\\nthe internal state of the target ion is mapped onto a co-trapped auxiliary ion.\\nThis mapping is typically mediated by normal modes of motion of the two-ion\\nCoulomb crystal in the trap. The present study investigates the role of\\nspectator modes not directly involved in a measurement protocol relying on a\\nstate-dependent optical-dipole force. We identify a Debye-Waller-type effect\\nthat modifies the response of the two-ion string to the force and show that\\ncooling all normal modes of the string allows for the detection of the\\nrovibrational ground state of a N$_2^+$ molecular ion with a fidelity exceeding\\n99.99% improving on previous experiments by more than an order of magnitude.\\nThis marked improvement in sensitivity paves the way for simultaneously\\nidentifying multiple rovibrational states at a fixed set of experimental\\nparameters.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:37:24Z\"}"}
