{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04398v1\", \"title\": \"Double Hot Jupiters Through ZLK Migration\", \"summary\": \"The von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) mechanism with tidal friction has been\\ndemonstrated as a promising avenue to generate hot Jupiters in stellar binary\\nsystems. Previous population studies of hot Jupiter formation have largely\\nexamined this mechanism in systems comprised of three bodies: two stars and one\\nplanet. However, because stars in a binary system form in similar environments\\nwith comparable metallicities, the formation of a single hot Jupiter in such a\\nsystem may imply that the conditions are more likely met for the companion\\nstar, as well. We investigate the ZLK mechanism with tidal friction as a\\npotential mechanism to produce double hot Jupiter systems in stellar binaries.\\nUsing N-body simulations, we characterize the evolution of two cold Jupiters,\\neach orbiting one star in a binary system, undergoing mirrored ZLK migration.\\nWe then examine the robustness of this mechanism to asymmetries in stellar\\nmasses, planet masses, and planet orbital inclinations relative to the binary\\nplane. We predict that, under the assumptions that (1) most hot Jupiters in\\nbinary star systems form through ZLK migration of primordially formed cold\\nJupiters and (2) if one star in a binary system forms a cold Jupiter, the\\nsecond does as well, a comprehensive search could identify double hot Jupiters\\nin up to ~9% of the close- to moderate- separation $a<2000$ AU) binary systems\\nthat already host a known hot Jupiter. We also argue that a blind search for\\nZLK-migrated double hot Jupiters should prioritize twin stellar binaries with\\npericenter approaches of a few hundred AU.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T13:23:20Z\"}"}
