{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10250v1\", \"title\": \"MURR: Model Updating with Regularized Replay for Searching a Document\\n  Stream\", \"summary\": \"The Internet produces a continuous stream of new documents and user-generated\\nqueries. These naturally change over time based on events in the world and the\\nevolution of language. Neural retrieval models that were trained once on a\\nfixed set of query-document pairs will quickly start misrepresenting\\nnewly-created content and queries, leading to less effective retrieval.\\nTraditional statistical sparse retrieval can update collection statistics to\\nreflect these changes in the use of language in documents and queries. In\\ncontrast, continued fine-tuning of the language model underlying neural\\nretrieval approaches such as DPR and ColBERT creates incompatibility with\\npreviously-encoded documents. Re-encoding and re-indexing all\\npreviously-processed documents can be costly. In this work, we explore updating\\na neural dual encoder retrieval model without reprocessing past documents in\\nthe stream. We propose MURR, a model updating strategy with regularized replay,\\nto ensure the model can still faithfully search existing documents without\\nreprocessing, while continuing to update the model for the latest topics. In\\nour simulated streaming environments, we show that fine-tuning models using\\nMURR leads to more effective and more consistent retrieval results than other\\nstrategies as the stream of documents and queries progresses.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR,cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T14:13:03Z\"}"}
