However, random and unknown sample\\norientations as well as low signal to noise ratios have so far prevented a\\nsuccessful application to smaller specimens like single biomolecules. We here\\npresent resolution-annealed stochastic gradient ascent (RASTA), a new approach\\nfor direct atomistic electron density determination, which utilizes our\\nrecently developed rigorous Bayesian treatment of single-particle X-ray\\nscattering. We demonstrate electron density determination at 2\\\\r{A} resolution\\nof various small proteins from synthetic scattering images with as low as 15\\nphotons per image.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.comp-ph,physics.bio-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T10:18:14Z\"}"}
