{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19591v1\", \"title\": \"Semantic Packet Aggregation for Token Communication via Genetic Beam\\n  Search\", \"summary\": \"Token communication (TC) is poised to play a pivotal role in emerging\\nlanguage-driven applications such as AI-generated content (AIGC) and wireless\\nlanguage models (LLMs). However, token loss caused by channel noise can\\nseverely degrade task performance. To address this, in this article, we focus\\non the problem of semantics-aware packetization and develop a novel algorithm,\\ntermed semantic packet aggregation with genetic beam search (SemPA-GBeam),\\nwhich aims to maximize the average token similarity (ATS) over erasure\\nchannels. Inspired from the genetic algorithm (GA) and the beam search\\nalgorithm, SemPA-GBeam iteratively optimizes token grouping for packetization\\nwithin a fixed number of groups (i.e., fixed beam width in beam search) while\\nrandomly swapping a fraction of tokens (i.e., mutation in GA). Experiments on\\nthe MS-COCO dataset demonstrate that SemPA-GBeam achieves ATS and LPIPS scores\\ncomparable to exhaustive search while reducing complexity by more than 20x.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T08:53:39Z\"}"}
