{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17600v1\", \"title\": \"Model Choice Matters for Age Inference on the Red Giant Branch\", \"summary\": \"Galactic archaeology relies on accurate stellar parameters to reconstruct the\\ngalaxy's history, including information on stellar ages. While the precision of\\ndata has improved significantly in recent years, stellar models used for age\\ninference have not improved at a similar rate. In fact, different models yield\\nnotably different age predictions for the same observational data. In this\\npaper, we assess the difference in age predictions of various widely used model\\ngrids for stars along the red giant branch. Using open source software, we\\nconduct a comparison of four different evolution grids and we find that age\\nestimations become less reliable if stellar mass is not known, with differences\\noccasionally exceeding $80\\\\%$. Additionally, we note significant disagreements\\nin the models' age estimations at non-solar metallicity. Finally, we present a\\nmethod for including theoretical uncertainties from stellar evolutionary tracks\\nin age inferences of red giants, aimed at improving the accuracy of age\\nestimation techniques used in the galactic archaeology community.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:26:17Z\"}"}
