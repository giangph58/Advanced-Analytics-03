We show that the geometric\\nrelationship between Langlands parameter spaces of $\\\\mathbf{GL}_n(\\\\mathbb{C})$\\nand $\\\\mathbf{GL}_m(\\\\mathbb{Q}_p)$ constructed by the first named author is\\ncompatible with the functor recently defined algebraically by Chan-Wong. We\\nthen show that the said relationship intertwines translation functors on\\nrepresentations of $\\\\mathbf{GL}_n(\\\\mathbb{C})$ and partial\\nBernstein-Zelevinskii derivatives on representations of\\n$\\\\mathbf{GL}_m(\\\\mathbb{Q}_p)$, providing purely geometric counterparts to some\\nresults of Chan-Wong. In the sequels, the techniques of this work will be\\nextended to other classical groups and used to study their Arthur packets.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RT\", \"categories\": \"math.RT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T07:21:00Z\"}"}
