Based on geometric optics, design formulas\\nare derived for the focal length and general spherical aberration coefficients\\nof specifically crossed ponderomotive lenses. Numerical calculations\\ndemonstrate that a pair of these crossed ponderomotive lenses can effectively\\ncorrect spherical aberration in the objective lens of an electron microscope.\\nUnlike rotationally symmetric ponderomotive lenses, which require the optical\\nbeam to be coaxially aligned with the electron beam, the crossed ponderomotive\\nlens avoids the need to place optical mirrors and lenses directly on the beam\\naxis. Thus, it offers practical advantages in designing and building electron\\noptical instruments and contributes to system miniaturization. With lens\\nproperties similar to multipole lenses, the proposed crossed ponderomotive lens\\nis expected to facilitate diverse developments in electron optical systems\\nincorporating ponderomotive potentials.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T08:49:37Z\"}"}
