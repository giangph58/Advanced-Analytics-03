Furthermore, we provide a qualitative and quantitative analysis of\\nthe corpus. The resulting dataset exhibits a broad spectrum of cross-lingual\\nsimilarity, ranging from near-translations to loosely related articles, making\\nit valuable for various NLP applications and broad linguistically motivated\\nstudies. We publicly release the dataset in document- and sentence-aligned\\nversions and code for the described experiments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:16:08Z\"}"}
