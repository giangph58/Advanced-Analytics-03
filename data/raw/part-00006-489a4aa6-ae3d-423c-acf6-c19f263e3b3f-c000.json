In that\\npaper, the following row completion problems were also solved arising when the\\neigenstructure was partially prescribed, keeping the restriction on the degree:\\nthe eigenstructure but the row (column) minimal indices, and the finite and/or\\ninfinite structures. Here we remove the restriction on the degree, allowing it\\nto be greater than or equal to that of the submatrix. We also generalize the\\nresults to rational matrices. Obviously, the results obtained hold for the\\ncorresponding column completion problems.\", \"main_category\": \"math.SP\", \"categories\": \"math.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T15:11:19Z\"}"}
