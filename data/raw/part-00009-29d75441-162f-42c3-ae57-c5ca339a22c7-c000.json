{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16615v1\", \"title\": \"Algorithmic Mirror: Designing an Interactive Tool to Promote\\n  Self-Reflection for YouTube Recommendations\", \"summary\": \"Big Data analytics and Artificial Intelligence systems derive non-intuitive\\nand often unverifiable inferences about individuals' behaviors, preferences,\\nand private lives. Drawing on diverse, feature-rich datasets of unpredictable\\nvalue, these systems erode the intuitive connection between our actions and how\\nwe are perceived, diminishing control over our digital identities. While\\nExplainable Artificial Intelligence scholars have attempted to explain the\\ninner workings of algorithms, their visualizations frequently overwhelm\\nend-users with complexity. This research introduces 'hypothetical inference', a\\nnovel approach that uses language models to simulate how algorithms might\\ninterpret users' digital footprints and infer personal characteristics without\\nrequiring access to proprietary platform algorithms. Through empirical studies\\nwith fourteen adult participants, we identified three key design opportunities\\nto foster critical algorithmic literacy: (1) reassembling scattered digital\\nfootprints into a unified map, (2) simulating algorithmic inference through\\nLLM-generated interpretations, and (3) incorporating temporal dimensions to\\nvisualize evolving patterns. This research lays the groundwork for tools that\\ncan help users recognize the influence of data on platforms and develop greater\\nautonomy in increasingly algorithm-mediated digital environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T11:00:17Z\"}"}
