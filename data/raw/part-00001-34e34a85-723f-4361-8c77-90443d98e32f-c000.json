{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13088v1\", \"title\": \"Imperative MPC: An End-to-End Self-Supervised Learning with\\n  Differentiable MPC for UAV Attitude Control\", \"summary\": \"Modeling and control of nonlinear dynamics are critical in robotics,\\nespecially in scenarios with unpredictable external influences and complex\\ndynamics. Traditional cascaded modular control pipelines often yield suboptimal\\nperformance due to conservative assumptions and tedious parameter tuning. Pure\\ndata-driven approaches promise robust performance but suffer from low sample\\nefficiency, sim-to-real gaps, and reliance on extensive datasets. Hybrid\\nmethods combining learning-based and traditional model-based control in an\\nend-to-end manner offer a promising alternative. This work presents a\\nself-supervised learning framework combining learning-based inertial odometry\\n(IO) module and differentiable model predictive control (d-MPC) for Unmanned\\nAerial Vehicle (UAV) attitude control. The IO denoises raw IMU measurements and\\npredicts UAV attitudes, which are then optimized by MPC for control actions in\\na bi-level optimization (BLO) setup, where the inner MPC optimizes control\\nactions and the upper level minimizes discrepancy between real-world and\\npredicted performance. The framework is thus end-to-end and can be trained in a\\nself-supervised manner. This approach combines the strength of learning-based\\nperception with the interpretable model-based control. Results show the\\neffectiveness even under strong wind. It can simultaneously enhance both the\\nMPC parameter learning and IMU prediction performance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T16:55:34Z\"}"}
