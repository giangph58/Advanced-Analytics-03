{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00399v1\", \"title\": \"Stealth Signals: Multi-Discriminator GANs for Covert Communications\\n  Against Diverse Wardens\", \"summary\": \"Covert wireless communications are critical for concealing the existence of\\nany transmission from adversarial wardens, particularly in complex environments\\nwith multiple heterogeneous detectors. This paper proposes a novel adversarial\\nAI framework leveraging a multi-discriminator Generative Adversarial Network\\n(GAN) to design signals that evade detection by diverse wardens, while ensuring\\nreliable decoding by the intended receiver. The transmitter is modeled as a\\ngenerator that produces noise-like signals, while every warden is modeled as an\\nindividual discriminator, suggesting varied channel conditions and detection\\ntechniques. Unlike traditional methods like spread spectrum or\\nsingle-discriminator GANs, our approach addresses multi-warden scenarios with\\nmoving receiver and wardens, which enhances robustness in urban surveillance,\\nmilitary operations, and 6G networks. Performance evaluation shows encouraging\\nresults with improved detection probabilities and bit error rates (BERs), in up\\nto five warden cases, compared to noise injection and single-discriminator\\nbaselines. The scalability and flexibility of the system make it a potential\\ncandidate for future wireless secure systems, and potential future directions\\ninclude real-time optimization and synergy with 6G technologies such as\\nintelligent reflecting surfaces.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T08:43:20Z\"}"}
