This remains true even with\\nrecent large global datasets. To address this challenge, we propose a novel\\ndomain-generalization framework for satellite images. Instead of trying to\\nlearn a single generalizable model, we train one expert model per training\\ndomain, while learning experts' similarity and encouraging similar experts to\\nbe consistent. A model selection module then identifies the most suitable\\nexperts for a given test sample and aggregates their predictions. Experiments\\non four datasets (DynamicEarthNet, MUDS, OSCD, and FMoW) demonstrate consistent\\ngains over existing domain generalization and adaptation methods. Our code is\\npublicly available at https://github.com/Abhishek19009/CoDEx.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T12:33:39Z\"}"}
