In this paper, we provide a\\nthree-functor formalism for commutative von Neumann algebras and their modules.\\nUsing the Gelfand-Naimark theorem, this gives rise to a three-functor formalism\\nfor measure spaces and measurable bundles of Hilbert spaces. We use this to\\nprove Fell absorption for unitary representations of measure groupoids.\\n  The three-functor formalism for commutative von Neumann algebras takes values\\nin W*-categories, and we discuss in what sense it is a unitary three-functor\\nformalism.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OA\", \"categories\": \"math.OA,math.CT,math.QA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T11:37:36Z\"}"}
