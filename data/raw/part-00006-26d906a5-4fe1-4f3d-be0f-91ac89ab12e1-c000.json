For this purpose, we find the maximal solution of a linear system\\nover such semiring, and use the properties of circulant matrix to demonstrate\\nthat the protocol is vulnerable. Specifically, we provide an efficient attack\\nthat recovers the shared secret key from publicly exchanged information for any\\ninstance of the digital semiring in polynomial time.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.IT,math.AC,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T13:25:29Z\"}"}
