In practical engineering, the number of\\ninput data is often limited, which can damage the validity of the optimal\\nresults obtained by RBDO. Confidence-based design optimization (CBDO) has been\\nproposed to account for the uncertainty of the input distribution. However,\\nthis approach faces challenges, computational cost and accuracy when dealing\\nwith highly nonlinear performance constraints. In this paper, we consider the\\ncompliance minimization problem of truss structures with uncertain external\\nforces. Armed with the advanced risk measure, conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR),\\nwe formulate a bi-objective optimization problem for the worst-case expected\\nvalue and the worst-case CVaR of compliance, which allows us to account for the\\ntail risk of performance functions not addressed in CBDO. Employing kernel\\ndensity estimation for estimation of the input distribution allows us to\\neliminate the need for modeling the input distribution. We show that this\\nproblem reduces to a second-order cone programming when assigning either\\nuniform kernel or triangular kernel. Finally, through numerical experiments, we\\nobtain the Pareto front for the bi-objective optimization problem of the\\nworst-case expected value and CVaR of compliance of truss structures, and\\nconfirm the changes in the Pareto solutions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:26:23Z\"}"}
