{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04182v1\", \"title\": \"Beyond Task Performance: Human Experience in Human-Robot Collaboration\", \"summary\": \"Human interaction experience plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of\\nhuman-machine collaboration, especially as interactions in future systems\\nprogress towards tighter physical and functional integration. While automation\\ndesign has been shown to impact task performance, its influence on human\\nexperience metrics such as flow, sense of agency (SoA), and embodiment remains\\nunderexplored. This study investigates how variations in automation design\\naffect these psychological experience measures and examines correlations\\nbetween subjective experience and physiological indicators. A user study was\\nconducted in a simulated wood workshop, where participants collaborated with a\\nlightweight robot under four automation levels. The results of the study\\nindicate that medium automation levels enhance flow, SoA and embodiment,\\nstriking a balance between support and user autonomy. In contrast, higher\\nautomation, despite optimizing task performance, diminishes perceived flow and\\nagency. Furthermore, we observed that grip force might be considered as a\\nreal-time proxy of SoA, while correlations with heart rate variability were\\ninconclusive. The findings underscore the necessity for automation strategies\\nthat integrate human- centric metrics, aiming to optimize both performance and\\nuser experience in collaborative robotic systems\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T07:28:16Z\"}"}
