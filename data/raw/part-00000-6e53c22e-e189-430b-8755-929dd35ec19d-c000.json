{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05396v1\", \"title\": \"A Pain Assessment Framework based on multimodal data and Deep Machine\\n  Learning methods\", \"summary\": \"From the original abstract:\\n  This thesis initially aims to study the pain assessment process from a\\nclinical-theoretical perspective while exploring and examining existing\\nautomatic approaches. Building on this foundation, the primary objective of\\nthis Ph.D. project is to develop innovative computational methods for automatic\\npain assessment that achieve high performance and are applicable in real\\nclinical settings. A primary goal is to thoroughly investigate and assess\\nsignificant factors, including demographic elements that impact pain\\nperception, as recognized in pain research, through a computational standpoint.\\nWithin the limits of the available data in this research area, our goal was to\\ndesign, develop, propose, and offer automatic pain assessment pipelines for\\nunimodal and multimodal configurations that are applicable to the specific\\nrequirements of different scenarios. The studies published in this Ph.D. thesis\\nshowcased the effectiveness of the proposed methods, achieving state-of-the-art\\nresults. Additionally, they paved the way for exploring new approaches in\\nartificial intelligence, foundation models, and generative artificial\\nintelligence.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.HC,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T16:32:55Z\"}"}
