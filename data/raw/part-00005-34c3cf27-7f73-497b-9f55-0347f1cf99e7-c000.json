Since\\nthat original derivation, a variety of proofs have developed, mainly focused on\\nthe initial data formulation on maximal spacelike slices of spacetime. Most of\\nthese proofs are applicable only for classical fields, as the energy conditions\\nrequired are violated in the context of quantum field theory. In this work we\\nprovide two generalizations of the Penrose inequality spherically symmetric\\nspacetimes: a proof of a classical inequality using initial data and an average\\nenergy condition and proof of a generalized inequality for evaporating black\\nholes with a connection to the weak cosmic censorship. The latter case could\\nalso be applicable to quantum fields. Finally, we provide physically motivated\\nexamples for both.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T13:37:05Z\"}"}
