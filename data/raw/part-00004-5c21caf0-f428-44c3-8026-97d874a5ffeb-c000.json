The study\\nutilised a design-based research approach to evaluate the effectiveness of VR\\ntours in this context. It specifically examined the responses of adult learners\\nto this instructional strategy by collecting data through surveys, observation\\nnotes and interviews with four learners in Japan and five learners in France,\\nmost of whom completed 10 lessons over 4 months. The research findings\\nhighlight the effectiveness of VR tours in enhancing learner motivation.\\nAdditionally, they demonstrate that perceived learning outcomes are influenced\\nnot only by the immersive experience of spatial presence but also by the\\nnovelty of technological and scenery-related aspects within the VR environment,\\nas well as factors related to lesson design and individual learner\\ncharacteristics.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY,cs.ET\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T03:08:52Z\"}"}
