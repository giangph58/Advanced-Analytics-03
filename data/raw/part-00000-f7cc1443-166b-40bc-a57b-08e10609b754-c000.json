Here, we propose using\\ncircularly polarized light to tune the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)\\ninteraction in two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets. Using the real-space\\nretarded Green's functions approach, our results show that while the Heisenberg\\nand Ising exchanges dominate, a notable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction\\nalso plays a key role. Furthermore, the inherent strength of altermagnetism\\nimprints chirp-like signatures into the magnetic responses, which can be\\ndynamically tuned via light. We mainly demonstrate that gate-induced Rashba\\nspin-orbit coupling is essential in response to light -- light selectively and\\nanisotropically adjusts the DM interaction without affecting the other\\nexchanges. Our findings further indicate that rotating the altermagnet by\\n$45^\\\\circ$ relative to the light's polarization direction generates a\\nDirac-like dispersion and different DM interactions. We finally extract\\ncritical thresholds where light reverses DM interactions along one axis or\\nbalances both in-plane components. The anisotropic light-driven control of RKKY\\ninteractions in 2D altermagnets not only highlights their unique properties but\\nalso opens new avenues for engineering tailored magnetic characteristics in\\nspintronic applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:03:27Z\"}"}
