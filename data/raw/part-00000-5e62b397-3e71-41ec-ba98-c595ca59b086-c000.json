{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17365v1\", \"title\": \"TimeSoccer: An End-to-End Multimodal Large Language Model for Soccer\\n  Commentary Generation\", \"summary\": \"Soccer is a globally popular sporting event, typically characterized by long\\nmatches and distinctive highlight moments. Recent advances in Multimodal Large\\nLanguage Models (MLLMs) offer promising capabilities in temporal grounding and\\nvideo understanding, soccer commentary generation often requires precise\\ntemporal localization and semantically rich descriptions over long-form video.\\nHowever, existing soccer MLLMs often rely on the temporal a priori for caption\\ngeneration, so they cannot process the soccer video end-to-end. While some\\ntraditional approaches follow a two-step paradigm that is complex and fails to\\ncapture the global context to achieve suboptimal performance. To solve the\\nabove issues, we present TimeSoccer, the first end-to-end soccer MLLM for\\nSingle-anchor Dense Video Captioning (SDVC) in full-match soccer videos.\\nTimeSoccer jointly predicts timestamps and generates captions in a single pass,\\nenabling global context modeling across 45-minute matches. To support long\\nvideo understanding of soccer matches, we introduce MoFA-Select, a\\ntraining-free, motion-aware frame compression module that adaptively selects\\nrepresentative frames via a coarse-to-fine strategy, and incorporates\\ncomplementary training paradigms to strengthen the model's ability to handle\\nlong temporal sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TimeSoccer\\nachieves State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance on the SDVC task in an end-to-end\\nform, generating high-quality commentary with accurate temporal alignment and\\nstrong semantic relevance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T08:27:42Z\"}"}
