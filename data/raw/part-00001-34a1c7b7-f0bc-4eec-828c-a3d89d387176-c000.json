The simplest possibility consists of a cosmological scalar field\\n$\\\\varphi$, dubbed quintessence, driving the accelerated expansion. We assess\\nthe evidence for the existence of such a scalar field. We find that, if the\\naccelerated expansion is driven by quintessence, the data favour a potential\\nenergy $V(\\\\varphi)$ that is concave, i.e., $m^2=d^2V/d\\\\varphi^2<0$.\\nFurthermore, and more significantly, the data strongly favour a scalar field\\nthat is non-minimally coupled to gravity (Bayes factor $\\\\log(B) = 7.34 \\\\pm\\n0.60$), leading to time variations in the gravitational constant on\\ncosmological scales, and the existence of fifth forces on smaller scales. The\\nfact that we do not observe such fifth forces implies that either new physics\\nmust come into play on non-cosmological scales or that quintessence is an\\nunlikely explanation for the observed cosmic acceleration.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T12:07:47Z\"}"}
