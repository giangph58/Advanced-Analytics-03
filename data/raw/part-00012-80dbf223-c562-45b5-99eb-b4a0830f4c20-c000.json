{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11361v1\", \"title\": \"Dynamical Casimir effect in superconducting cavities: from photon\\n  generation to universal quantum gates\", \"summary\": \"This chapter explores various aspects of the Dynamical Casimir Effect (DCE)\\nand its implications in the context of circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED).\\nWe begin by reviewing the origin and fundamental properties of the DCE,\\nincluding three equivalent mathematical frameworks that offer complementary\\nperspectives on the phenomenon. These formulations will serve as a foundation\\nfor the subsequent analyses. We then turn our attention to the practical\\nrealization of the DCE in cQED-based architectures, discussing how modern\\nsuperconducting circuits can be engineered to exhibit this inherently quantum\\neffect. Building on this, we examine how the presence of the DCE influences the\\nperformance of a quantum thermal machine operating with a quantum field,\\nshedding light on the interplay between quantum fluctuations and thermodynamic\\nprocesses. Further, we demonstrate how the DCE can be harnessed to implement a\\ncontrolled-squeeze gate within a cQED platform, opening a path toward advanced\\nquantum control and quantum information processing. The chapter concludes with\\na synthesis of the main results and a discussion of potential future\\ndirections.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.other\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:28:00Z\"}"}
