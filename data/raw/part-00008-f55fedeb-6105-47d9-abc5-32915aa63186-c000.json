Among these, the entire solutions\\ndefined on $\\\\mathbb C^2$ induce flat Kahler metrics, as expected by a question\\nof Calabi. In contrast, those on cylindrical domains produce a family of\\nnowhere flat Kahler metrics. Beyond these smooth solutions, we also classify\\nsolutions that are radially symmetric in one variable, which exhibit various\\ntypes of singularities. Finally, we explore analogous solutions to Donaldson's\\nequation motivated by a result of He.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CV\", \"categories\": \"math.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:48:28Z\"}"}
