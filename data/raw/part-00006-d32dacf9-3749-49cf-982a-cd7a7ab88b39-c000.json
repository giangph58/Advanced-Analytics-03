To be precise, we\\ndemonstrate in this work, that this method does not provide solutions of the\\nassociated Weyl (Dirac) equation, nor does it fulfill the boundary conditions\\nimposed on the spinor eigenfunctions to ensure confinement of the particle to\\nthe domain of the billiard. We review in detail the wave equation, boundary\\nconditions and quantization of NBs and derivation of relevant equations, to\\nmake the proof comprehensible for the general reader. Our results are\\ncorroborated with numerical results for non-relativistic and relativistic\\nquantum billiards whose shapes depend on a parameter, which allows the study of\\nthe properties of their eigenstates as the classical dynamics experiences a\\ntransition from regular to chaotic dynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.CD\", \"categories\": \"nlin.CD,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T12:31:07Z\"}"}
