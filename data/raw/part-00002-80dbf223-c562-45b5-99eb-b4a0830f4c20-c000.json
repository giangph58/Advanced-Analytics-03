By making Gauss' Theorema Egregium a necessary condition we\\ndevelop a sensible notion of isometric surfaces in isotropic space. The\\nwell-known examples in Euclidean space, like isometries within the associated\\nfamily of minimal surfaces, Bour's theorem, and Minding isometries, find their\\nnatural analogues in isotropic space. We also include an extensive treatment of\\ninfinitesimal flexibility, or infinitesimal deformation, of surfaces. We prove\\nresults for the isotropic displacement diagrams in analogy to its well-known\\ncounterparts in Euclidean space culminating in the existence of an isotropic\\nDarboux wreath consisting of six surfaces. We show several interesting\\nrelations for special parametrizations involving Koenigs and Voss nets of\\nsmooth and discrete surfaces within the Darboux wreath and we encounter\\nsurfaces of constant Gaussian and mean curvature. At several occasions, we\\npoint to connections to statics as the isotropic space is a natural language to\\ndescribe the Airy stress function.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:22:37Z\"}"}
