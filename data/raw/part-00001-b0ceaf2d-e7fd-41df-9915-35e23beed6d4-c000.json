For this system, we determined the\\ncritical quantities and noticed that the free energy in the bulk exhibits\\nswallow tail behavior. In the boundary CFT, the presence of second order phase\\ntransition is observed. At constant charge, the heat capacity is finite in the\\nbulk but diverges at critical points in the boundary CFT. Furthermore, we tried\\nto determine the nature of interactions between black hole molecules in the\\nboundary CFT and in the bulk, which is novel for charged AdS black holes with\\nstring clouds.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T07:24:37Z\"}"}
