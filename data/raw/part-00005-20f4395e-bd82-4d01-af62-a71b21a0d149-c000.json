We successfully train the deep residual neural network (ResNet) based\\non CMU-Deeplens architecture, which is designed to detect strong lenses in\\nground-based imaging surveys. We train on images of real strong lenses and\\ndeploy on a sample of 8 million galaxies in areas with full coverage in the g,\\nr, and i filters, the first multi-band search for strong gravitational lenses\\nin UNIONS. Following human inspection and grading, we report the discovery of a\\ntotal of 1346 new strong lens candidates of which 146 are grade A, 199 grade B,\\nand 1001 grade C. Of these candidates, 283 have lens-galaxy spectroscopic\\nredshifts from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and an additional 297 from\\nthe Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1 (DR1). We find\\n15 of these systems display evidence of both lens and source galaxy redshifts\\nin spectral superposition. We additionally report the spectroscopic\\nconfirmation of seven lensed sources in highquality systems, all with z > 2.1,\\nusing the Keck Near-Infrared Echelle Spectrograph (NIRES) and Gemini\\nNear-Infrared Spectrograph (GNIRS).\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T08:11:38Z\"}"}
