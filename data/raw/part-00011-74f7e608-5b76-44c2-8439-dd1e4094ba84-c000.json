{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05953v1\", \"title\": \"On walk domination: Between different types of walks and $m_3$-path\", \"summary\": \"This paper investigates the domination relationships among various types of\\nwalks connecting two non-adjacent vertices in a graph. In particular, we center\\nour attention on the problem which is proposed in [S. B. Tondato, Graphs\\nCombin. 40 (2024)]. A \\\\textit{\\\\( uv \\\\)-\\\\( m_3 \\\\) path} is a \\\\( uv \\\\)-induced\\npath of length at least three. A walk between two non-adjacent vertices in a\\ngraph $G$ is called a weakly toll walk if the first and last vertices in the\\nwalk are adjacent only to the second and second-to-last vertices, respectively,\\nand these intermediate vertices may appear more than once in the walk. And an\\n$l_k$-path is an induced path of length at most $k$ between two non-adjacent\\nvertices in a graph $G$. We study the domination between weakly toll walks,\\n$l_k$-paths ($k\\\\in \\\\left\\\\{2,3\\\\right\\\\}$) and different types of walks connecting\\ntwo non-adjacent vertices $u$ and $v$ of a graph (shortest paths, tolled walks,\\nweakly toll walks, $l_k$-paths for $k\\\\in \\\\left\\\\{2,3\\\\right\\\\}$, $m_3$-path), and\\nshow how these give rise to characterizations of graph classes.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:06:30Z\"}"}
