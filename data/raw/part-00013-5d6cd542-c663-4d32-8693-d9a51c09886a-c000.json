{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15101v1\", \"title\": \"NeuGaze: Reshaping the future BCI\", \"summary\": \"Traditional brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), reliant on costly\\nelectroencephalography or invasive implants, struggle with complex\\nhuman-computer interactions due to setup complexity and limited precision. We\\npresent NeuGaze, a novel webcam-based system that leverages eye gaze, head\\nmovements, and facial expressions to enable intuitive, real-time control using\\nonly a standard 30 Hz webcam, often pre-installed in laptops. Requiring minimal\\ncalibration, NeuGaze achieves performance comparable to conventional inputs,\\nsupporting precise cursor navigation, key triggering via an efficient skill\\nwheel, and dynamic gaming interactions, such as defeating formidable opponents\\nin first-person games. By harnessing preserved neck-up functionalities in\\nmotor-impaired individuals, NeuGaze eliminates the need for specialized\\nhardware, offering a low-cost, accessible alternative to BCIs. This paradigm\\nempowers diverse applications, from assistive technology to entertainment,\\nredefining human-computer interaction for motor-impaired users.
