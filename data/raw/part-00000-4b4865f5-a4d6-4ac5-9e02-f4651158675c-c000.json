Hamilton-Jacobi reachability (HJR) analysis is a widely used method\\nfor guaranteeing safety under worst-case disturbances. Traditional HJR methods\\nprovide safety guarantees but suffer from the curse of dimensionality, limiting\\ntheir scalability to high-dimensional systems or varying environmental\\nconditions. In this work, we propose HJRNO, a neural operator-based framework\\nfor solving backward reachable tubes (BRTs) efficiently and accurately. By\\nleveraging the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), HJRNO learns a mapping between\\nvalue functions, enabling fast inference with strong generalization across\\ndifferent obstacle shapes, system configurations, and hyperparameters. We\\ndemonstrate that HJRNO achieves low error on random obstacle scenarios and\\ngeneralizes effectively across varying system dynamics. These results suggest\\nthat HJRNO offers a promising foundation model approach for scalable, real-time\\nsafety analysis in autonomous systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:06:05Z\"}"}
