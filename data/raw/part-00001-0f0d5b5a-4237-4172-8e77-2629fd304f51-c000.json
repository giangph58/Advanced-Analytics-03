This work bridges the gap between\\ntheory and practice by engineering and empirically evaluating recently\\ndeveloped approximation algorithms for dynamically maintaining graph\\norientations. We comprehensively describe the underlying data structures,\\nincluding efficient bucketing techniques and round-robin updates. Our\\nimplementation has a natural parameter $\\\\lambda$, which allows for a trade-off\\nbetween algorithmic efficiency and the quality of the solution. In the\\nextensive experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that our implementation\\noffers a considerable speedup. Using different quality metrics, we show that\\nour implementations are very competitive and can outperform previous methods.\\nOverall, our approach solves more instances than other methods while being up\\nto 112 times faster on instances that are solvable by all methods compared.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T13:51:10Z\"}"}
