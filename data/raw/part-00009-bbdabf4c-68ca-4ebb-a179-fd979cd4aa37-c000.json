Rate coefficients for Maxwellian electron distributions have been\\nprovided and used extensively in the literature and many databases for\\nastrophysics. Here, we provide averaged collision strengths to be used to model\\nplasma where electrons are non-Maxwellian, which often occur in laboratory and\\nastrophysical plasma. We also provide for many ions new Maxwellian-averaged\\ncollision strengths which include important corrections to the published\\nvalues. The H- and He-like atomic data were recently made available in\\nMao+(2022). Here, we provide data for ions of the Li-, Be-, B-, C-, N-, O-,\\nNe-, Na-, and Mg-like sequences.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph,astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T17:37:09Z\"}"}
