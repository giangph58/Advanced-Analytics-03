Using a large-scale quantum Monte Carlo method, we obtain a\\nrich ground state phase diagram. Around half-filling, the infinite long-range\\nlight-matter interaction lifts the ground state degeneracy, resulting in a\\nnovel order-coexisted superradiant clock (SRC) phase that completely destroys\\nthe fragile order-by-disorder (OBD) phase observed in classical light fields.\\nAccording to the Ginzburg-Landau theory, this replacement may result from the\\ncompetition between threefold and sixfold clock terms. Similar to the spin\\nsupersolid, the clear first-order phase transition at the $Z_2$ symmetry line\\nis attributed to the nonzero photon density, which couples to the threefold\\nclock term. Finally, we discuss the low-energy physics in the dimer language\\nand propose that cavity-mediated nonlocal ring exchange interactions may play a\\ncritical role in the rich physics induced by the attachment of cavity-QED. Our\\nwork opens a new arena of research on the emergent phenomena of quantum phase\\ntransitions in many-body quantum optics.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas,cond-mat.str-el,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:29:45Z\"}"}
