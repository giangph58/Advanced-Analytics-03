Given that the number of local\\ncost functions can be large as well as the number of constraints, a stochastic\\noptimization method is proposed. The method belongs to the class of variable\\nsample size first order methods, where the sample size is adaptive and governed\\nby the additional sampling technique earlier proposed in unconstrained\\noptimization framework. The resulting algorithm may be a mini-batch method,\\nincreasing sample size method, or even deterministic in a sense that it\\neventually reaches the full sample size, depending on the problem and\\nsimilarity of the local cost functions. Regarding the constraints, the method\\nuses controlled, but inexact projections on the feasible set, yielding possibly\\ninfeasible iterates. Almost sure convergence is proved under some standard\\nassumptions for the stochastic framework, without imposing the convexity.\\nNumerical results on relevant problems from CUTEst collection and real-world\\ndata sets for logistic regression show the stability and the efficiency of the\\nproposed method when compared to the state-of-the-art methods.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,G.1.6\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T09:41:13Z\"}"}
