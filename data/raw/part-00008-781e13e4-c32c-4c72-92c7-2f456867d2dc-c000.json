In this work, we\\ninvestigate such correlations for time-dependent excitation and develop a\\nmethodology to compute efficiently time-integrated correlations, which are at\\nthe heart of the photon-counting theory, and subsequently apply it to analyze\\nthe photon emission of pulsed systems. By combining this formalism with the\\nsensor method -- which facilitates frequency-resolved correlations -- we\\ndemonstrate how spectral filtering enhances single-photon purity and suppresses\\nmulti-photon noise in time-bin-encoded quantum states. Specifically, filtering\\nthe central spectral peak of a dynamically driven two-level system boosts\\ntemporal coherence and improves the fidelity of time-bin entanglement\\npreparation, even under conditions favoring multi-photon emission. These\\nresults establish spectral filtering as a critical tool for tailoring photon\\nstatistics in pulsed quantum light sources.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T16:27:13Z\"}"}
