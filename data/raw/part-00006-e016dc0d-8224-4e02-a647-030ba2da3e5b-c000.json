Understanding the Impact of Conversational\\n  Styles on Preference Elicitation in Conversational Recommender Systems\", \"summary\": \"Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) provide users with an interactive\\nmeans to express preferences and receive real-time personalized\\nrecommendations. The success of these systems is heavily influenced by the\\npreference elicitation process. While existing research mainly focuses on what\\nquestions to ask during preference elicitation, there is a notable gap in\\nunderstanding what role broader interaction patterns including tone, pacing,\\nand level of proactiveness play in supporting users in completing a given task.\\nThis study investigates the impact of different conversational styles on\\npreference elicitation, task performance, and user satisfaction with CRSs. We\\nconducted a controlled experiment in the context of scientific literature\\nrecommendation, contrasting two distinct conversational styles, high\\ninvolvement (fast paced, direct, and proactive with frequent prompts) and high\\nconsiderateness (polite and accommodating, prioritizing clarity and user\\ncomfort) alongside a flexible experimental condition where users could switch\\nbetween the two. Our results indicate that adapting conversational strategies\\nbased on user expertise and allowing flexibility between styles can enhance\\nboth user satisfaction and the effectiveness of recommendations in CRSs.\\nOverall, our findings hold important implications for the design of future\\nCRSs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:01:17Z\"}"}
