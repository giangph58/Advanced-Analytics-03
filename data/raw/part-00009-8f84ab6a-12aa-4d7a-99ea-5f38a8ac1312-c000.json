{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14926v1\", \"title\": \"Lower bounds for online size Ramsey numbers for paths\", \"summary\": \"Given two graphs $H_1$ and $H_2$, an online Ramsey game is played on the edge\\nset of $K_\\\\mathbb{N}$. In every round Builder selects an edge and Painter\\ncolors it red or blue. Builder is trying to force Painter to create a red copy\\nof $H_1$ or a blue copy of $H_2$ as soon as possible, while Painter's goal is\\nthe opposite. The online (size) Ramsey number $\\\\tilde{r}(H_1,H_2)$ is the\\nsmallest number of rounds in the game provided Builder and Painter play\\noptimally. Let $v(G)$ be the number of vertices in the graph $G$ and $v_1(G)$\\nbe the number of vertices of degree 1 in $G$. We prove that if $G$ has no\\nisolated vertices, then $\\\\tilde{r}(P_7,G)\\\\ge 8v(G)/5-v_1(G)$,\\n$\\\\tilde{r}(P_8,G)\\\\ge 18v(G)/11-v_1(G)$ and $\\\\tilde{r}(P_9,G)\\\\ge\\n5v(G)/3-v_1(G)$. In particular $\\\\tilde{r}(P_9,P_n)\\\\ge 5n/3-2,$ which with known\\nupper bound implies $\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\tilde{r}(P_9,P_n)/n=5/3.$ We also show\\nthat for any fixed $k$, $\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\tilde{r}(P_k,P_n)/n$ exists.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T07:48:03Z\"}"}
