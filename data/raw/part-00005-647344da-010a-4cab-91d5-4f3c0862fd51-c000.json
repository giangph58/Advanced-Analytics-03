{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20725v1\", \"title\": \"Quasinormal Modes and Shadows of Black Holes in Infinite Derivative\\n  Theory of Gravity\", \"summary\": \"In this work, we study the quasinormal modes (QNMs) and shadow of a\\nSchwarzschild black hole (BH) with higher-order metric corrections, in the\\nframework of the Infinite Derivative theory of Gravity (IDG). We study the\\neffects of corrections to the BH's metric, which arises from the IDG's\\ncorrections, on the QNMs and shadow of the BH. We used the 6th-order Pad\\\\'{e}\\naveraged WKB approximation method to study the QNMs of the BH perturbed by a\\nscalar field. The dependence of the amplitude and damping of QNMs with respect\\nto the free parameters has been analysed. It is found that the BH system\\nbecomes unstable for some values of the free parameters. We also studied the\\ntime evolution of a scalar field around the BH spacetime. The QNMs have also\\nbeen calculated from the time profile of the evolution, which show good\\nagreement with the values obtained from the WKB method. The variation of the\\nshadow radius of the BH due to the inclusion of higher-order corrections has\\nbeen studied. Finally, we constrain the free parameters associated with the\\ncorrection terms using the data from the Keck and VLTI observation, and we\\nobtain some bounds on the parameters.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:06:42Z\"}"}
