{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14919v1\", \"title\": \"GenCLIP: Generalizing CLIP Prompts for Zero-shot Anomaly Detection\", \"summary\": \"Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) aims to identify anomalies in unseen\\ncategories by leveraging CLIP's zero-shot capabilities to match text prompts\\nwith visual features. A key challenge in ZSAD is learning general prompts\\nstably and utilizing them effectively, while maintaining both generalizability\\nand category specificity. Although general prompts have been explored in prior\\nworks, achieving their stable optimization and effective deployment remains a\\nsignificant challenge. In this work, we propose GenCLIP, a novel framework that\\nlearns and leverages general prompts more effectively through multi-layer\\nprompting and dual-branch inference. Multi-layer prompting integrates\\ncategory-specific visual cues from different CLIP layers, enriching general\\nprompts with more comprehensive and robust feature representations. By\\ncombining general prompts with multi-layer visual features, our method further\\nenhances its generalization capability. To balance specificity and\\ngeneralization, we introduce a dual-branch inference strategy, where a\\nvision-enhanced branch captures fine-grained category-specific features, while\\na query-only branch prioritizes generalization. The complementary outputs from\\nboth branches improve the stability and reliability of anomaly detection across\\nunseen categories. Additionally, we propose an adaptive text prompt filtering\\nmechanism, which removes irrelevant or atypical class names not encountered\\nduring CLIP's training, ensuring that only meaningful textual inputs contribute\\nto the final vision-language alignment.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T07:38:25Z\"}"}
