However, excess variability may indicate system\\ndysregulations that may be associated with poor outcomes. In this paper, we\\naddress the long-standing problem of using variability information of multiple\\nlongitudinal biomarkers in time-to-event analyses by formulating and studying a\\nBayesian joint model. We first model multiple longitudinal biomarkers, some of\\nwhich are subject to limit-of-detection censoring. We then model the survival\\ntimes by incorporating random effects and variances from the longitudinal\\ncomponent as predictors through threshold regression that admits\\nnon-proportional hazards. We demonstrate the operating characteristics of the\\nproposed joint model through simulations and apply it to data from the Study of\\nWomen's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) to investigate the impact of the mean\\nand variability of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and anti-Mullerian\\nhormone (AMH) on age at the final menstrual period (FMP).\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:33:04Z\"}"}
