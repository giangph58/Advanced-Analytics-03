{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02306v1\", \"title\": \"Lepton emission rates of 43-64V isotopes under stellar conditions\", \"summary\": \"In astrophysical conditions prevalent during the late times of stellar\\nevolution, lepton ($e^-$ and $e^+$) emission processes compete with the\\ncorresponding lepton capture processes. Prior to the collapse, lepton emissions\\nsignificantly affect the cooling of the core and reduce its entropy. Therefore,\\nthe lepton emission rates for Fe-group nuclei serve as an important input for\\ncore-collapse simulations of high-mass stars.\\n  From earlier simulation studies, isotopes of vanadium (V) have great\\nastrophysical significance in regard to their weak-decay rates, which\\nsubstantially affect $Y_e$ (fraction of lepton to baryon number) during the\\nfinal developmental stages of massive stars. The current study involves the\\ncomputation of the weak lepton emission (LE) rates for V isotopes by employing\\nthe improved deformed proton-neutron Quasi-particle Random Phase Approximation\\n(pn-QRPA) model. The mass numbers of the selected isotopes range from 43 to 64.\\nThe LE rates on these isotopes have been estimated for a broad spectrum of\\ndensity and temperature under astrophysical conditions. The ranges considered\\nfor density and temperature are $10^1$ to $10^{11}$ (g/cm$^3$) and $10^7$ to $3\\n\\\\times 10^{11}$ (K), respectively.\\n  The lepton emission rates from the present study were also compared to the\\nrates previously estimated by using the independent-particle model (IPM) and\\nlarge-scale shell model (LSSM). IPM rates are generally bigger than QRPA rates,\\nwhile LSSM rates overall show a good comparison with the reported rates.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T06:31:19Z\"}"}
