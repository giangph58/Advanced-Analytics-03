{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04221v1\", \"title\": \"New solutions for the symmetrical n-body problem through variational\\n  approach and optimisation techniques\", \"summary\": \"Advances in the variational approach to the $n$-body problem have led to\\nsignificant progress in celestial mechanics, uncovering new types of possible\\norbits. In this paper, critical points of the Lagrangian action associated with\\nthe $n$-body problem are analysed using evolutionary algorithms to identify\\nperiodic and symmetrical solutions of the discretised system. A key objective\\nis to locate minimum points of the action functional, as these correspond to\\nfeasible periodic solutions that satisfy the system's differential equations.\\nBy employing both stochastic and deterministic algorithms, we explore the\\nsolution space and obtain numerical representations of these orbits.\\n  Next, we examine the stability of these orbits by treating them as critical\\npoints. One approach is to compute their discrete Morse index to distinguish\\nbetween minimum points and saddle points. Another is to classify them based on\\ntheir action levels. Finally, analysing the boundaries of their attraction\\nbasins allows us to identify non-minimal critical points via the\\nAmbrosetti-Rabinowitz Mountain Pass Theorem. This leads to an updated version\\nof the algorithm that provides a constructive proof of the theorem, yielding\\nnew orbits in specific cases.\\n  This paper builds upon and extends the results presented in \\\\cite{nostro},\\nproviding a more detailed theoretical framework and deeper insights into the\\nformulation. Additionally, we present new numerical results and an extended\\nanalysis of the critical points found, further enhancing the findings of the\\nprevious study.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:19:54Z\"}"}
