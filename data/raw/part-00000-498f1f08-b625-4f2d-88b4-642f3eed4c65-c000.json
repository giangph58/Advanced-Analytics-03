We consider both straight and curved waveguides\\nof constant width, and the estimates are presented in terms of norms of the\\npotential. For curved quantum waveguide, we assume that the waveguide is not\\nself-intersecting and its curvature is a continuous and bounded function on R.\\nThe estimates are new, particularly for the case of curved quantum waveguides\\nand this opens a window for their extension to different configurations such as\\nwaveguides with local defamations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.SP\", \"categories\": \"math.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T13:00:52Z\"}"}
