{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23763v1\", \"title\": \"Career Incentives, Risk-Taking, and Sorting Dynamics: Evidence from Top\\n  Financial Advisers\", \"summary\": \"We examine how career concerns influence the behavior and mobility of\\nfinancial advisers. Drawing on a uniquely comprehensive matched panel that\\ncombines employer-employee data with a longstanding national ranking, our study\\ntests predictions from classic career concerns models and tournament theory.\\nOur analysis shows that, in the early stages of their careers, advisers\\ndestined for top performance differ significantly from their peers.\\nSpecifically, before being ranked, these advisers are twice as likely to obtain\\na key investment license, experience customer disputes at rates up to seven\\ntimes higher, and transition to firms with 80% larger total assets. Moreover,\\nwe find that top advisers mitigate the potential costs of their higher\\nrisk-taking by facing reduced labor market penalties following disciplinary\\nactions. Leveraging exogenous variation from the staggered adoption of the\\nBroker Protocol through an event-study framework, our results reveal dynamic\\nsorting: firms attract high-performing advisers intensely within a short\\npost-adoption period. These findings shed new light on the interplay between\\ncareer incentives, risk-taking, and labor market outcomes in the financial\\nservices industry, with important implications for both firm performance and\\nregulatory policy.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T06:27:41Z\"}"}
