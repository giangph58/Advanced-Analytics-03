{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21663v1\", \"title\": \"Reducing Weighted Ensemble Variance With Optimal Trajectory Management\", \"summary\": \"Weighted ensemble (WE) is an enhanced path-sampling method that is\\nconceptually simple, widely applicable, and statistically exact. In a WE\\nsimulation, an ensemble of trajectories is periodically pruned or replicated to\\nenhance sampling of rare transitions and improve estimation of mean first\\npassage times (MFPTs). However, poor choices of the parameters governing\\npruning and replication can lead to high-variance MFPT estimates. Our previous\\nwork [J. Chem. Phys. 158, 014108 (2023)] presented an optimal WE\\nparameterization strategy and applied it in low-dimensional example systems.\\nThe strategy harnesses estimated local MFPTs from different initial\\nconfigurations to a single target state. In the present work, we apply the\\noptimal parameterization strategy to more challenging, high-dimensional\\nmolecular models, namely, synthetic molecular dynamics (MD) models of Trp-cage\\nfolding and unfolding, as well as atomistic MD models of NTL9 folding in\\nhigh-friction and low-friction continuum solvents. In each system we use WE to\\nestimate the MFPT for folding or unfolding events. We show that the optimal\\nparameterization reduces the variance of MFPT estimates in three of four\\nsystems, with dramatic improvement in the most challenging atomistic system.\\nOverall, the parameterization strategy improves the accuracy and reliability of\\nWE estimates for the kinetics of biophysical processes.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:03:58Z\"}"}
