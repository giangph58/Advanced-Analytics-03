{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06946v1\", \"title\": \"Uniqueness of Lp Minkowski problem in the supercritical range\", \"summary\": \"The uniqueness of the $L_p$-Minkowski problem has been a long standing\\nproblem in convex geometry. In the groundbreaking paper by\\nBrendle-Choi-Daskalopoulos (Acta Math, {\\\\bf219}, 2017), a full uniqueness\\nresult was shown for the subcritical exponents $p\\\\in(-n-1,1]$. In the\\nsupercritical range, the uniqueness problem is much more complicated, even in\\nthe planar case $n=1$. One of the famous results was shown by Andrews (J. Amer.\\nMath. Soc., {\\\\bf16}, 2003), where he established that the uniqueness holds in\\nthe range $p\\\\in(-7,-2)$ and fails to hold for the other supercritical exponents\\n$p\\\\in(-\\\\infty,-7)$. In this paper, we study the same uniqueness problem in the\\nfull supercritical range $p\\\\in(-2n-5,-n-1)$ for all higher dimensional cases\\n$n\\\\geq2$. We will prove that for $p\\\\in(-2n-5,-n-1)$, the unique strongly\\nsymmetric solution is given by the unit sphere ${\\\\mathbb{S}}^n$. The uniqueness\\nrange $(-2n-5,-n-1)$ is optimal due to our recent preprint (arXiv: 2104.07426)\\njoint with J. Lu and Y.N. Liu, where we have constructed non-spherical strongly\\nsymmetric solutions for all $p\\\\in(-\\\\infty,-2n-5)$. When considering general\\nsolutions without symmetricity assumption, the uniqueness set $\\\\Gamma$ of $p$\\nfor which the uniqueness holds, is shown to be both relatively open and closed\\nin the full interval $(-2n-5,-n-1)$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:53:18Z\"}"}
