{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20016v1\", \"title\": \"Applying LLM-Powered Virtual Humans to Child Interviews in\\n  Child-Centered Design\", \"summary\": \"In child-centered design, directly engaging children is crucial for deeply\\nunderstanding their experiences. However, current research often prioritizes\\nadult perspectives, as interviewing children involves unique challenges such as\\nenvironmental sensitivities and the need for trust-building. AI-powered virtual\\nhumans (VHs) offer a promising approach to facilitate engaging and multimodal\\ninteractions with children. This study establishes key design guidelines for\\nLLM-powered virtual humans tailored to child interviews, standardizing\\nmultimodal elements including color schemes, voice characteristics, facial\\nfeatures, expressions, head movements, and gestures. Using ChatGPT-based prompt\\nengineering, we developed three distinct Human-AI workflows (LLM-Auto,\\nLLM-Interview, and LLM-Analyze) and conducted a user study involving 15\\nchildren aged 6 to 12. The results indicated that the LLM-Analyze workflow\\noutperformed the others by eliciting longer responses, achieving higher user\\nexperience ratings, and promoting more effective child engagement.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.CY,cs.MM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:35:46Z\"}"}
