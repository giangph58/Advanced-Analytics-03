When the supremum is taken over a finite\\ninterval, the upper bound depends linearly on the $L^\\\\gamma$-norm of the\\nkernel, for any $\\\\gamma>2$. We demonstrate the utility of this inequality in\\nquantifying the pathwise distance between two stochastic Volterra equations\\nwith distinct kernels, with a particular emphasis on the multifactor Markovian\\napproximation. For kernels that decay sufficiently fast, we derive an\\nalternative inequality valid over an infinite time interval, providing\\nuniform-in-time bounds for mean-reverting stochastic Volterra equations.\\nFinally, we compare our findings with existing results in the literature.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:02:11Z\"}"}
