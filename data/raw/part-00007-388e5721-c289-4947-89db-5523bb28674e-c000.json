{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19722v1\", \"title\": \"The ATLAS of Traffic Lights: A Reliable Perception Framework for\\n  Autonomous Driving\", \"summary\": \"Traffic light perception is an essential component of the camera-based\\nperception system for autonomous vehicles, enabling accurate detection and\\ninterpretation of traffic lights to ensure safe navigation through complex\\nurban environments. In this work, we propose a modularized perception framework\\nthat integrates state-of-the-art detection models with a novel real-time\\nassociation and decision framework, enabling seamless deployment into an\\nautonomous driving stack. To address the limitations of existing public\\ndatasets, we introduce the ATLAS dataset, which provides comprehensive\\nannotations of traffic light states and pictograms across diverse environmental\\nconditions and camera setups. This dataset is publicly available at\\nhttps://url.fzi.de/ATLAS. We train and evaluate several state-of-the-art\\ntraffic light detection architectures on ATLAS, demonstrating significant\\nperformance improvements in both accuracy and robustness. Finally, we evaluate\\nthe framework in real-world scenarios by deploying it in an autonomous vehicle\\nto make decisions at traffic light-controlled intersections, highlighting its\\nreliability and effectiveness for real-time operation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T12:15:42Z\"}"}
