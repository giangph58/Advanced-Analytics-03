{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12218v1\", \"title\": \"Accountable Liveness\", \"summary\": \"Safety and liveness are the two classical security properties of consensus\\nprotocols. Recent works have strengthened safety with accountability: should\\nany safety violation occur, a sizable fraction of adversary nodes can be proven\\nto be protocol violators. This paper studies to what extent analogous\\naccountability guarantees are achievable for liveness. To reveal the full\\ncomplexity of this question, we introduce an interpolation between the\\nclassical synchronous and partially-synchronous models that we call the\\n$x$-partially-synchronous network model in which, intuitively, at most an $x$\\nfraction of the time steps in any sufficiently long interval are asynchronous\\n(and, as with a partially-synchronous network, all time steps are synchronous\\nfollowing the passage of an unknown \\\"global stablization time\\\"). We prove a\\nprecise characterization of the parameter regime in which accountable liveness\\nis achievable: if and only if $x < 1/2$ and $f < n/2$, where $n$ denotes the\\nnumber of nodes and $f$ the number of nodes controlled by an adversary. We\\nfurther refine the problem statement and our analysis by parameterizing by the\\nnumber of violating nodes identified following a liveness violation, and\\nprovide evidence that the guarantees achieved by our protocol are near-optimal\\n(as a function of $x$ and $f$). Our results provide rigorous foundations for\\nliveness-accountability heuristics such as the \\\"inactivity leaks\\\" employed in\\nEthereum.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T16:13:09Z\"}"}
