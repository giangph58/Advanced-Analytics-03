{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10834v1\", \"title\": \"LightFormer: A lightweight and efficient decoder for remote sensing\\n  image segmentation\", \"summary\": \"Deep learning techniques have achieved remarkable success in the semantic\\nsegmentation of remote sensing images and in land-use change detection.\\nNevertheless, their real-time deployment on edge platforms remains constrained\\nby decoder complexity. Herein, we introduce LightFormer, a lightweight decoder\\nfor time-critical tasks that involve unstructured targets, such as disaster\\nassessment, unmanned aerial vehicle search-and-rescue, and cultural heritage\\nmonitoring. LightFormer employs a feature-fusion and refinement module built on\\nchannel processing and a learnable gating mechanism to aggregate multi-scale,\\nmulti-range information efficiently, which drastically curtails model\\ncomplexity. Furthermore, we propose a spatial information selection module\\n(SISM) that integrates long-range attention with a detail preservation branch\\nto capture spatial dependencies across multiple scales, thereby substantially\\nimproving the recognition of unstructured targets in complex scenes. On the\\nISPRS Vaihingen benchmark, LightFormer attains 99.9% of GLFFNet's mIoU (83.9%\\nvs. 84.0%) while requiring only 14.7% of its FLOPs and 15.9% of its parameters,\\nthus achieving an excellent accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Consistent results\\non LoveDA, ISPRS Potsdam, RescueNet, and FloodNet further demonstrate its\\nrobustness and superior perception of unstructured objects. These findings\\nhighlight LightFormer as a practical solution for remote sensing applications\\nwhere both computational economy and high-precision segmentation are\\nimperative.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T03:25:39Z\"}"}
