{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17276v1\", \"title\": \"HeRB: Heterophily-Resolved Structure Balancer for Graph Neural Networks\", \"summary\": \"Recent research has witnessed the remarkable progress of Graph Neural\\nNetworks (GNNs) in the realm of graph data representation. However, GNNs still\\nencounter the challenge of structural imbalance. Prior solutions to this\\nproblem did not take graph heterophily into account, namely that connected\\nnodes process distinct labels or features, thus resulting in a deficiency in\\neffectiveness. Upon verifying the impact of heterophily on solving the\\nstructural imbalance problem, we propose to rectify the heterophily first and\\nthen transfer homophilic knowledge. To the end, we devise a method named HeRB\\n(Heterophily-Resolved Structure Balancer) for GNNs. HeRB consists of two\\ninnovative components: 1) A heterophily-lessening augmentation module which\\nserves to reduce inter-class edges and increase intra-class edges; 2) A\\nhomophilic knowledge transfer mechanism to convey homophilic information from\\nhead nodes to tail nodes. Experimental results demonstrate that HeRB achieves\\nsuperior performance on two homophilic and six heterophilic benchmark datasets,\\nand the ablation studies further validate the efficacy of two proposed\\ncomponents.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T06:04:59Z\"}"}
