This has spurred the development\\nof (Bayesian) methods that use these generative models for inverse problems in\\nimage restoration, such as denoising, inpainting, and super-resolution. In\\nrecent years, generative modeling for Bayesian inference on sensory data has\\nalso gained traction. Nevertheless, the direct application of generative\\nmodeling techniques initially designed for natural images on raw sensory data\\nis not straightforward, requiring solutions that deal with high dynamic range\\nsignals acquired from multiple sensors or arrays of sensors that interfere with\\neach other, and that typically acquire data at a very high rate. Moreover, the\\nexact physical data-generating process is often complex or unknown. As a\\nconsequence, approximate models are used, resulting in discrepancies between\\nmodel predictions and the observations that are non-Gaussian, in turn\\ncomplicating the Bayesian inverse problem. Finally, sensor data is often used\\nin real-time processing or decision-making systems, imposing stringent\\nrequirements on, e.g., latency and throughput. In this paper, we will discuss\\nsome of these challenges and offer approaches to address them, all in the\\ncontext of high-rate real-time sensing applications in automotive radar and\\nmedical imaging.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T15:03:01Z\"}"}
