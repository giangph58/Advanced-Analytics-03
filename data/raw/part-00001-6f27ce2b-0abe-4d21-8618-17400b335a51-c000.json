{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09948v1\", \"title\": \"Omni-Dish: Photorealistic and Faithful Image Generation and Editing for\\n  Arbitrary Chinese Dishes\", \"summary\": \"Dish images play a crucial role in the digital era, with the demand for\\nculturally distinctive dish images continuously increasing due to the\\ndigitization of the food industry and e-commerce. In general cases, existing\\ntext-to-image generation models excel in producing high-quality images;\\nhowever, they struggle to capture diverse characteristics and faithful details\\nof specific domains, particularly Chinese dishes. To address this limitation,\\nwe propose Omni-Dish, the first text-to-image generation model specifically\\ntailored for Chinese dishes. We develop a comprehensive dish curation pipeline,\\nbuilding the largest dish dataset to date. Additionally, we introduce a\\nrecaption strategy and employ a coarse-to-fine training scheme to help the\\nmodel better learn fine-grained culinary nuances. During inference, we enhance\\nthe user's textual input using a pre-constructed high-quality caption library\\nand a large language model, enabling more photorealistic and faithful image\\ngeneration. Furthermore, to extend our model's capability for dish editing\\ntasks, we propose Concept-Enhanced P2P. Based on this approach, we build a dish\\nediting dataset and train a specialized editing model. Extensive experiments\\ndemonstrate the superiority of our methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI,cs.MM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T07:18:32Z\"}"}
