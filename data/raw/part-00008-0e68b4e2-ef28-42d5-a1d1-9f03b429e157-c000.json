However, existing tools often apply end-to-end approaches and face\\nchallenges such as high specification efforts, maintenance difficulties, and\\nflaky tests while coupling to GUI framework specifics. To address these\\nchallenges, we introduce the ViMoTest tool, which leverages Behavior-driven\\nDevelopment, the ViewModel architectural pattern, and projectional\\nDomain-specific Languages (DSLs) to isolate and test presentation logic\\nindependently of GUI frameworks. We demonstrate the tool with a small\\nJavaFX-based task manager example and generate executable code.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T14:26:35Z\"}"}
