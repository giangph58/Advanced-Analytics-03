{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17595v1\", \"title\": \"RGB-D Tracking via Hierarchical Modality Aggregation and Distribution\\n  Network\", \"summary\": \"The integration of dual-modal features has been pivotal in advancing\\nRGB-Depth (RGB-D) tracking. However, current trackers are less efficient and\\nfocus solely on single-level features, resulting in weaker robustness in fusion\\nand slower speeds that fail to meet the demands of real-world applications. In\\nthis paper, we introduce a novel network, denoted as HMAD (Hierarchical\\nModality Aggregation and Distribution), which addresses these challenges. HMAD\\nleverages the distinct feature representation strengths of RGB and depth\\nmodalities, giving prominence to a hierarchical approach for feature\\ndistribution and fusion, thereby enhancing the robustness of RGB-D tracking.\\nExperimental results on various RGB-D datasets demonstrate that HMAD achieves\\nstate-of-the-art performance. Moreover, real-world experiments further validate\\nHMAD's capacity to effectively handle a spectrum of tracking challenges in\\nreal-time scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:22:13Z\"}"}
