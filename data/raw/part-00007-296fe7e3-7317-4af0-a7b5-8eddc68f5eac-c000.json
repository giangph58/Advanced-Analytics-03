{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10067v1\", \"title\": \"Undermining Federated Learning Accuracy in EdgeIoT via Variational Graph\\n  Auto-Encoders\", \"summary\": \"EdgeIoT represents an approach that brings together mobile edge computing\\nwith Internet of Things (IoT) devices, allowing for data processing close to\\nthe data source. Sending source data to a server is bandwidth-intensive and may\\ncompromise privacy. Instead, federated learning allows each device to upload a\\nshared machine-learning model update with locally processed data. However, this\\ntechnique, which depends on aggregating model updates from various IoT devices,\\nis vulnerable to attacks from malicious entities that may inject harmful data\\ninto the learning process. This paper introduces a new attack method targeting\\nfederated learning in EdgeIoT, known as data-independent model manipulation\\nattack. This attack does not rely on training data from the IoT devices but\\ninstead uses an adversarial variational graph auto-encoder (AV-GAE) to create\\nmalicious model updates by analyzing benign model updates intercepted during\\ncommunication. AV-GAE identifies and exploits structural relationships between\\nbenign models and their training data features. By manipulating these\\nstructural correlations, the attack maximizes the training loss of the\\nfederated learning system, compromising its overall effectiveness.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T10:09:38Z\"}"}
