In contrast, Deep Learning\\n(DL) approaches lack physical insight. To address this, we propose CoHNet - an\\nend-to-end framework that combines the best of both worlds: DL optimized with\\nphysics-informed constraints. We leverage a pre-trained neural surrogate model\\nto enforce physical plausibility through a unique training loss. Our\\nexperiments show that this approach not only improves forest height estimation\\naccuracy but also produces meaningful features that enhance the reliability of\\npredictions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:44:08Z\"}"}
