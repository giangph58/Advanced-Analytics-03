These structures suggest a scenario in which PBHs and DM can\\nexist simultaneously. However, in the high-frequency regime, the gravitational\\nlensing effect of bare PBHs is similar to that of dPBHs. Ground-based\\ngravitational wave (GW) detectors are particularly sensitive to high-frequency\\nGW signals. In this regime, the lensing effect of a point-mass lens with a mass\\nin the range of $10^{-1} \\\\sim 10^2 M_{\\\\odot}$ becomes significant. In this\\nwork, we incorporate dPBH models with GW observations and employ Bayesian\\ninference techniques to distinguish PBHs from dPBHs. Using the third-generation\\nground-based GW detectors, Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE), as\\nexamples, we demonstrate that these detectors can effectively differentiate the\\nlensing effects of dPBHs from those of PBHs across a broad frequency range.\\nFurthermore, we find that with a larger black hole (BH) mass inside the\\nsurrounding particle DM, ET and CE can distinguish these two lensed models with\\neven greater precision.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T09:14:59Z\"}"}
