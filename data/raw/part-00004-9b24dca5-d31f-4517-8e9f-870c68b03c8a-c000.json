However,\\nresearch on AI adoption in rural India remains limited, with existing studies\\nfocusing primarily on urban settings. This study examines the perceptions of\\nvolunteer teachers on AI integration in rural education, identifying key\\nchallenges and opportunities. Through semi-structured interviews with 23\\nvolunteer educators in Rajasthan and Delhi, we conducted a thematic analysis to\\nexplore infrastructure constraints, teacher preparedness, and digital literacy\\ngaps. Findings indicate that while LLMs could enhance personalized learning and\\nreduce teacher workload, barriers such as poor connectivity, lack of AI\\ntraining, and parental skepticism hinder adoption. Despite concerns over\\nover-reliance and ethical risks, volunteers emphasize that AI should be seen as\\na complementary tool rather than a replacement for traditional teaching. Given\\nthe potential benefits, LLM-based tutors merit further exploration in rural\\nclassrooms, with structured implementation and localized adaptations to ensure\\naccessibility and equity.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T04:14:32Z\"}"}
