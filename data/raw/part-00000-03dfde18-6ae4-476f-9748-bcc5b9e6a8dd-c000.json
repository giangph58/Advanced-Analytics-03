{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23888v1\", \"title\": \"MuseFace: Text-driven Face Editing via Diffusion-based Mask Generation\\n  Approach\", \"summary\": \"Face editing modifies the appearance of face, which plays a key role in\\ncustomization and enhancement of personal images. Although much work have\\nachieved remarkable success in text-driven face editing, they still face\\nsignificant challenges as none of them simultaneously fulfill the\\ncharacteristics of diversity, controllability and flexibility. To address this\\nchallenge, we propose MuseFace, a text-driven face editing framework, which\\nrelies solely on text prompt to enable face editing. Specifically, MuseFace\\nintegrates a Text-to-Mask diffusion model and a semantic-aware face editing\\nmodel, capable of directly generating fine-grained semantic masks from text and\\nperforming face editing. The Text-to-Mask diffusion model provides\\n\\\\textit{diversity} and \\\\textit{flexibility} to the framework, while the\\nsemantic-aware face editing model ensures \\\\textit{controllability} of the\\nframework. Our framework can create fine-grained semantic masks, making precise\\nface editing possible, and significantly enhancing the controllability and\\nflexibility of face editing models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\\nMuseFace achieves superior high-fidelity performance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T09:41:09Z\"}"}
