{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03256v1\", \"title\": \"Geometric means of HPD GLT matrix-sequences: a maximal result beyond\\n  invertibility assumptions on the GLT symbols\", \"summary\": \"In the current work, we consider the study of the spectral distribution of\\nthe geometric mean matrix-sequence of two matrix-sequences $\\\\{G(A_n, B_n)\\\\}_n$\\nformed by Hermitian Positive Definite (HPD) matrices,\\n  assuming that the two input matrix-sequences $\\\\{A_n\\\\}_n, \\\\{B_n\\\\}_n$ belong to\\nthe same $d$-level $r$-block Generalized Locally Toeplitz (GLT) $\\\\ast$-algebra\\nwith $d,r\\\\ge 1$ and with GLT symbols $\\\\kappa, \\\\xi$. Building on recent results\\nin the literature, we examine whether the assumption that at least one of the\\ninput GLT symbols is invertible almost everywhere (a.e.) is necessary. Since\\ninversion is mainly required due to the non-commutativity of the matrix\\nproduct, it was conjectured that the hypothesis on the invertibility of the GLT\\nsymbols can be removed. In fact, we prove the conjectured statement that is \\\\[\\n\\\\{G(A_n, B_n)\\\\}_n \\\\sim_{\\\\mathrm{GLT}} (\\\\kappa \\\\xi)^{1/2} \\\\] when the symbols\\n$\\\\kappa, \\\\xi$ commute, which implies the important case where $r=1$ and $d \\\\geq\\n1 $, while the statement is generally false or even not well posed when the\\nsymbols are not invertible a.e. and do not commute. In fact, numerical\\nexperiments are conducted in the case where the two symbols do not commute,\\nshowing that the main results of the present work are maximal. Further\\nnumerical experiments, visualizations, and conclusions end the present\\ncontribution.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T07:36:30Z\"}"}
