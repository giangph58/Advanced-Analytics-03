The Role of Sampling and Legal Content Analysis in\\n  Systemic Risk Assessments and Independent Audits in the Digital Services Act\", \"summary\": \"A central requirement of the European Union's Digital Services Act (DSA) is\\nthat online platforms undergo internal and external audits. A key component of\\nthese audits is the assessment of systemic risks, including the dissemination\\nof illegal content, threats to fundamental rights, impacts on democratic\\nprocesses, and gender-based violence. The DSA Delegated Regulation outlines how\\nsuch audits should be conducted, setting expectations for both platforms and\\nauditors. This article evaluates the strengths and limitations of different\\nqualitative and quantitative methods for auditing these systemic risks and\\nproposes a mixed-method approach for DSA compliance. We argue that content\\nsampling, combined with legal and empirical analysis, offers a viable method\\nfor risk-specific audits. First, we examine relevant legal provisions on sample\\nselection for audit purposes. We then assess sampling techniques and methods\\nsuitable for detecting systemic risks, focusing on how representativeness can\\nbe understood across disciplines. Finally, we review initial systemic risk\\nassessment reports submitted by platforms, analyzing their testing and sampling\\nmethodologies. By proposing a structured, mixed-method approach tailored to\\nspecific risk categories and platform characteristics, this article addresses\\nthe challenge of evidence-based audits under the DSA. Our contribution\\nemphasizes the need for adaptable, context-sensitive auditing strategies and\\nadds to the emerging field of DSA compliance research.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:02:54Z\"}"}
