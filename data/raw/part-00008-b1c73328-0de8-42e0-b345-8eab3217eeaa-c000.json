{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01787v1\", \"title\": \"The Factors Influencing Well-Being in Software Engineers: A\\n  Cross-Country Mixed-Method Study\", \"summary\": \"The well-being of software engineers is increasingly under strain due to the\\nhigh-stress nature of their roles, which involve complex problem-solving, tight\\ndeadlines, and the pressures of rapidly evolving technologies.\\n  Despite increasing recognition of mental health challenges in software\\nengineering, few studies focus on the factors that sustain or undermine\\nwell-being. Existing research often overlooks the interaction between personal,\\ncollaborative, and organisational influences on this unique population. This\\nstudy fills this gap by investigating the specific factors affecting the\\nwell-being of software engineers. We conducted 15 qualitative interviews and\\ncomplemented them with a confirmatory cross-country survey to validate and\\nextend our findings to a broader population. Our mixed-methods approach\\nprovides a robust framework to identify key factors influencing well-being,\\nincluding personal perceptions of well-being, interpersonal and collaborative\\ndynamics, workplace support and recognition, organisational culture, and\\nspecific stressors inherent to software engineering.\\n  By offering a detailed, context-specific exploration of these factors, our\\nstudy builds on existing literature and provides actionable insights for\\nimproving well-being in software engineering. We conclude with policy\\nrecommendations to inform organisational strategies and develop targeted\\ninterventions that address the specific challenges of this field, contributing\\nto more sustainable and supportive work environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T14:51:58Z\"}"}
