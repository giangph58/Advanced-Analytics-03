There is currently a\\nlack of knowledge on how surgeons acquire these robotic surgical skills. To\\nhelp bridge this gap, we previously followed surgical residents learning\\ncomplex surgical training dry-lab tasks on a surgical robot over six months.\\nErrors are an important measure for self-training and for skill evaluation, but\\nunlike in virtual simulations, in dry-lab training, errors are difficult to\\nmonitor automatically. Here, we analyzed the errors in the ring tower transfer\\ntask, in which surgical residents moved a ring along a curved wire as quickly\\nand accurately as possible. We developed an image-processing algorithm to\\ndetect collision errors and achieved detection accuracy of ~95%. Using the\\ndetected errors and task completion time, we found that the surgical residents\\ndecreased their completion time and number of errors over the six months. This\\nanalysis provides a framework for detecting collision errors in similar\\nsurgical training tasks and sheds light on the learning process of the surgical\\nresidents.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T08:29:46Z\"}"}
