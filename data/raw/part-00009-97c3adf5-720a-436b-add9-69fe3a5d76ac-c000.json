{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03518v1\", \"title\": \"High-order exponential solver method for particle-in-cell simulations\", \"summary\": \"Outstanding advances in solid-state laser technology, employing the optical\\nparametric chirped-pulse-amplification (OPCPA) technique, have led physicists\\nto focus laser pulses to highly-relativistic intensities which led to novel\\nschemes for charged-particle acceleration and radiation generation in\\nlaser-driven plasmas. Microscopic understanding of these highly nonlinear\\nprocesses is possible via accurate modeling of the laser-plasma interaction\\nusing particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. Numerous codes are available and they\\nrely on finite difference time domain methods on Yee-grids or on the analytical\\nsolution of the Maxwell-equations in spectral space. In this work, we present a\\nsolution bridging these two methods, which we call finite difference\\nexponential time domain solution. This method could provide a very high\\naccuracy even in 3D, but with improved locality, similar to the pseudospectral\\nanalytical methods without relying on transformation to special basis\\nfunctions. We verified the accuracy and the convergence of the method in\\nvarious benchmarks, including laser propagation in vacuum and in underdense\\nplasma. We also simulated electron injection in a non-linear laser-plasma\\nwakefield acceleration and surface high-harmonic generation in the overdense\\nregime. The results are then compared with those obtained from standard PIC\\ncodes.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T13:30:53Z\"}"}
