{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15631v1\", \"title\": \"Can we build a transistor using vacancy-induced bound states in a\\n  topological insulator\", \"summary\": \"Topological insulators (TIs) have been considered as promising candidates for\\nnext generation of electronic devices due to their topologically protected\\nquantum transport phenomena. In this work, a scheme for atomic-scale field\\neffect transistor (FET) based on vacancy-induced edge states in TIs is\\npromoted. By designing the positions of vacancies, the closed channel between\\nsource and drain terminals provided by vacancy-induced edge states can have the\\nenergy spectra with a gap between edge and bulk states. When gate terminal\\nreceive the signal, electric field applied by gate terminal can shift quasi\\nFermi energy of the closed channel from edge states into the gap, and hence\\nopen the channel between source and drain terminals. The energy spectra and the\\neffect of electric field are demonstrated using Haldane model and density\\nfunctional theory (DFT) respectively. This work suggest possible revolutionary\\napplicational potentials of vacancy-induced edge states in topological\\ninsulators for atomic-scale electronics.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T06:45:30Z\"}"}
