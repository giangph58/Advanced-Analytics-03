{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12736v1\", \"title\": \"Incorporating a Deep Neural Network into Moving Horizon Estimation for\\n  Embedded Thermal Torque Derating of an Electric Machine\", \"summary\": \"This study introduces a novel state estimation framework that incorporates\\nDeep Neural Networks (DNNs) into Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE), shifting from\\ntraditional physics-based models to rapidly developed data-driven techniques. A\\nDNN model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) nodes is trained on synthetic data\\ngenerated by a high-fidelity thermal model of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous\\nMachine (PMSM), which undergoes thermal derating as part of the torque control\\nstrategy in a battery electric vehicle. The MHE is constructed by integrating\\nthe trained DNN with a simplified driving dynamics model in a discrete-time\\nformulation, incorporating the LSTM hidden and cell states in the state vector\\nto retain system dynamics. The resulting optimal control problem (OCP) is\\nformulated as a nonlinear program (NLP) and implemented using the acados\\nframework. Model-in-the-loop (MiL) simulations demonstrate accurate temperature\\nestimation, even under noisy sensor conditions or failures. Achieving threefold\\nreal-time capability on embedded hardware confirms the feasibility of the\\napproach for practical deployment. The primary focus of this study is to assess\\nthe feasibility of the MHE framework using a DNN-based plant model instead of\\nfocusing on quantitative comparisons of vehicle performance. Overall, this\\nresearch highlights the potential of DNN-based MHE for real-time,\\nsafety-critical applications by combining the strengths of model-based and\\ndata-driven methods.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T08:24:32Z\"}"}
