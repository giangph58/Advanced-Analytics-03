In this\\nwork, we introduce a novel approach to low-light image enhancement based on\\ndecomposed physics-informed priors. Existing methods that directly map\\nlow-light to normal-light images in the sRGB color space suffer from\\ninconsistent color predictions and high sensitivity to spectral power\\ndistribution (SPD) variations, resulting in unstable performance under diverse\\nlighting conditions. To address these challenges, we introduce a\\nPhysics-informed Color-aware Transform (PiCat), a learning-based framework that\\nconverts low-light images from the sRGB color space into deep\\nillumination-invariant descriptors via our proposed Color-aware Transform\\n(CAT). This transformation enables robust handling of complex lighting and SPD\\nvariations. Complementing this, we propose the Content-Noise Decomposition\\nNetwork (CNDN), which refines the descriptor distributions to better align with\\nwell-lit conditions by mitigating noise and other distortions, thereby\\neffectively restoring content representations to low-light images. The CAT and\\nthe CNDN collectively act as a physical prior, guiding the transformation\\nprocess from low-light to normal-light domains. Our proposed PiCat framework\\ndemonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across\\nfive benchmark datasets.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T09:23:38Z\"}"}
