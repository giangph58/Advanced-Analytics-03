In this class of\\nmodels, there are four propagating tensorial degrees of freedom, two vector\\ndegrees of freedom, and two scalar degrees of freedom, $\\\\delta_m$ and $\\\\Phi$,\\ncorresponding to gauge invariant perturbations in the matter density and the\\ngravitational Bardeen potential, respectively. We consider the era of matter\\ndomination, and requiring that growth of perturbations are recovered in the\\nscalar sector and classical instabilities are eliminated in the vector and\\ntensor sectors, we obtain bounds on the free coupling parameter to the\\nquadratic Weyl curvature term, $10^{14}H^2_0 \\\\lesssim \\\\alpha^{-1} \\\\ll\\nM^2_{\\\\text{cutoff}}$, where $M_{\\\\text{cutoff}}$ is the cutoff scale of the low\\nenergy effective field theory, and $\\\\alpha^{-1}$ is proportional to the masses\\nof the additional propagating degrees of freedom.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T10:11:40Z\"}"}
