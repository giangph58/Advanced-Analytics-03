We obtain a new time-dependent $q$-deformed\\nSchr\\\\\\\"odinger equation. The free time-evolution of a Gaussian wave packet and\\nthat induced by an harmonic interaction are studied within this $q$-deformed\\nquantum mechanical framework.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T17:07:50Z\"}"}
