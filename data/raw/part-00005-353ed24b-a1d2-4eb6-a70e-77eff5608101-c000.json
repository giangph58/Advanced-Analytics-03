{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07421v1\", \"title\": \"AgentAda: Skill-Adaptive Data Analytics for Tailored Insight Discovery\", \"summary\": \"We introduce AgentAda, the first LLM-powered analytics agent that can learn\\nand use new analytics skills to extract more specialized insights. Unlike\\nexisting methods that require users to manually decide which data analytics\\nmethod to apply, AgentAda automatically identifies the skill needed from a\\nlibrary of analytical skills to perform the analysis. This also allows AgentAda\\nto use skills that existing LLMs cannot perform out of the box. The library\\ncovers a range of methods, including clustering, predictive modeling, and NLP\\ntechniques like BERT, which allow AgentAda to handle complex analytics tasks\\nbased on what the user needs. AgentAda's dataset-to-insight extraction strategy\\nconsists of three key steps: (I) a question generator to generate queries\\nrelevant to the user's goal and persona, (II) a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented\\nGeneration (RAG)-based skill matcher to choose the best data analytics skill\\nfrom the skill library, and (III) a code generator that produces executable\\ncode based on the retrieved skill's documentation to extract key patterns. We\\nalso introduce KaggleBench, a benchmark of curated notebooks across diverse\\ndomains, to evaluate AgentAda's performance. We conducted a human evaluation\\ndemonstrating that AgentAda provides more insightful analytics than existing\\ntools, with 48.78% of evaluators preferring its analyses, compared to 27.67%\\nfor the unskilled agent. We also propose a novel LLM-as-a-judge approach that\\nwe show is aligned with human evaluation as a way to automate insight quality\\nevaluation at larger scale.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T03:27:25Z\"}"}
