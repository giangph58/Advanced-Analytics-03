In\\nthis work, we explore the possibility that a \\\"domain wall dominant (DWD)\\\" phase\\nexisted in the early universe and ended with DW decay. During the DWD phase,\\nthe universe undergoes a power-law accelerated expansion of the scale factor\\nand exhibits temporal superhorizon evolution of the relevant frequency modes.\\nWe show that this can lead to distinct features imprinted on the stochastic\\ngravitational wave (GW) background. Our findings provide a comprehensive\\nframework for evaluating GW emission associated with DWD, leading to\\ndistinguishable long-lived DW-induced GWs from other cosmological sources, with\\nsignificant implications for future GW observatories.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T10:28:48Z\"}"}
