{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00319v1\", \"title\": \"Beyond Quadratic Costs: A Bregman Divergence Approach to H$_\\\\infty$\\n  Control\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents a novel extension of the H$_\\\\infty$ control framework\\nthat generalizes the traditional quadratic cost formulation to accommodate\\nstrictly convex, nonquadratic functions for the state, control input, and\\ndisturbance. This new formulation not only captures additional noise\\ncharacteristics but also supports a range of performance objectives-including\\nsparse control, safety constraints, and other tailored behaviors-beyond what is\\npossible with quadratic costs. We derive a closed-form solution of a central\\ncontroller that minimizes the worst-case performance ratio under the proposed\\ncost structure. Furthermore, we develop Riccati-like equations that impose\\nnecessary and sufficient conditions on the nonquadratic cost functions, thereby\\nensuring the existence of a robust solution. Finally, we rigorously establish\\nLyapunov stability for the closed-loop system. The proposed framework bridges\\nrobust control theory with modern approaches in machine learning and signal\\nprocessing, offering enhanced flexibility and improved performance in complex\\ncontrol scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T05:38:36Z\"}"}
