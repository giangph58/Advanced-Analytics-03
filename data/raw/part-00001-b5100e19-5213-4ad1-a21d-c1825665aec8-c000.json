The main result of this work provides a linear isomorphism between\\n$\\\\mathcal{F}_s$ and the space of real multivariate polynomials. This\\nisomorphism identifies the cone of completely monotone functions with the cone\\nof non-negative polynomials. We conclude that the cone of completely monotone\\nfunctions in $\\\\mathcal{F}_s$ is semi-algebraic. This gives a finite time\\nalgorithm to decide whether a function in $\\\\mathcal{F}_s$ is completely\\nmonotone\", \"main_category\": \"math.CA\", \"categories\": \"math.CA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:23:56Z\"}"}
