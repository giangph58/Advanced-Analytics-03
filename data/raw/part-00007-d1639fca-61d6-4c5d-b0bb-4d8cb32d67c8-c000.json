{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01326v1\", \"title\": \"CFMD: Dynamic Cross-layer Feature Fusion for Salient Object Detection\", \"summary\": \"Cross-layer feature pyramid networks (CFPNs) have achieved notable progress\\nin multi-scale feature fusion and boundary detail preservation for salient\\nobject detection. However, traditional CFPNs still suffer from two core\\nlimitations: (1) a computational bottleneck caused by complex feature weighting\\noperations, and (2) degraded boundary accuracy due to feature blurring in the\\nupsampling process. To address these challenges, we propose CFMD, a novel\\ncross-layer feature pyramid network that introduces two key innovations. First,\\nwe design a context-aware feature aggregation module (CFLMA), which\\nincorporates the state-of-the-art Mamba architecture to construct a dynamic\\nweight distribution mechanism. This module adaptively adjusts feature\\nimportance based on image context, significantly improving both representation\\nefficiency and generalization. Second, we introduce an adaptive dynamic\\nupsampling unit (CFLMD) that preserves spatial details during resolution\\nrecovery. By adjusting the upsampling range dynamically and initializing with a\\nbilinear strategy, the module effectively reduces feature overlap and maintains\\nfine-grained boundary structures. Extensive experiments on three standard\\nbenchmarks using three mainstream backbone networks demonstrate that CFMD\\nachieves substantial improvements in pixel-level accuracy and boundary\\nsegmentation quality, especially in complex scenes. The results validate the\\neffectiveness of CFMD in jointly enhancing computational efficiency and\\nsegmentation performance, highlighting its strong potential in salient object\\ndetection tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T03:22:36Z\"}"}
