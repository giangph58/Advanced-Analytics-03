{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04129v1\", \"title\": \"Maxing Out the SVM: Performance Impact of Memory and Program Cache Sizes\\n  in the Agave Validator\", \"summary\": \"In this paper we analyze some of the bottlenecks in the execution pipeline of\\nSolana's Agave validator client, focusing on RAM and program cache usage under\\nmainnet conditions. Through a series of controlled experiments, we measure the\\nvalidator's throughput and resource efficiency as RAM availability ranges\\nbetween 128 GB to 1,536 GB (1.5 TB). We discover that the validator performance\\ndegrades significantly below 256 GB, with transaction processing falling behind\\nreal-time block production. Additionally, we study the program cache behavior,\\nidentifying inefficiencies in program eviction and load latency. Our results\\nprovide practical guidance for hardware provisioning and suggest improvements\\nto the Solana execution and caching strategy, reducing latency due to the\\nprogram cache by 90%.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T05:00:10Z\"}"}
