At\\nhigh temperatures, a phonon-assisted relaxation process is evoked to account\\nfor the pronounced increase of the linewidth in an exchange-narrowing regime\\n($k_{\\\\rm B}T\\\\gg J$). In contrast, at low temperatures ($k_{\\\\rm B}T\\\\lesssim J$),\\na power-law behavior in line narrowing is observed. Our data reveal two\\ndistinct power-law regimes for the linewidth which crossover at $T^*\\\\approx\\n7.5$~K. Notably, the intriguing evolution of the ESR linewidth in this\\nalternating kagome bilayer system with opposite sign of exchange interactions\\nhighlights distinct spin dynamics compared to those in a uniform kagome\\nantiferromagnet.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T05:45:25Z\"}"}
