{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02317v1\", \"title\": \"Temporal Gaussian Copula For Clinical Multivariate Time Series Data\\n  Imputation\", \"summary\": \"The imputation of the Multivariate time series (MTS) is particularly\\nchallenging since the MTS typically contains irregular patterns of missing\\nvalues due to various factors such as instrument failures, interference from\\nirrelevant data, and privacy regulations. Existing statistical methods and deep\\nlearning methods have shown promising results in time series imputation. In\\nthis paper, we propose a Temporal Gaussian Copula Model (TGC) for three-order\\nMTS imputation. The key idea is to leverage the Gaussian Copula to explore the\\ncross-variable and temporal relationships based on the latent Gaussian\\nrepresentation. Subsequently, we employ an Expectation-Maximization (EM)\\nalgorithm to improve robustness in managing data with varying missing rates.\\nComprehensive experiments were conducted on three real-world MTS datasets. The\\nresults demonstrate that our TGC substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art\\nimputation methods. Additionally, the TGC model exhibits stronger robustness to\\nthe varying missing ratios in the test dataset.
