Our\\ncharacterization is strict in the sense that it is up to equivalence between\\nvirtual double categories and, at the level of objects, up to isomorphism of\\nenriched categories. Throughout the paper, we treat enrichment in a unital\\nvirtual double category rather than in a bicategory or a monoidal category,\\nand, for consistency and better visualization of pasting diagrams, we adopt\\naugmented virtual double categories as a fundamental language for\\ndouble-categorical concepts.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CT\", \"categories\": \"math.CT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T11:45:59Z\"}"}
