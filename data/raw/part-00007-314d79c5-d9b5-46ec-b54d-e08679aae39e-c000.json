In\\nthis study, we propose a scalable framework that combines generative domain\\nadaptation with efficient contrastive learning to enhance classification\\nperformance. Using CycleGAN-based domain translation, we improve the quality of\\nnighttime images, enabling better feature extraction by downstream models.\\nWhile the baseline EVA-02 model employing CLIP-based contrastive loss achieves\\nan overall accuracy of 96.55\\\\%, it exhibits a significant performance gap\\nbetween daytime (97.21\\\\%) and nighttime conditions (63.40\\\\%). Replacing CLIP\\nwith the lightweight SigLIP-2 (Sigmoid contrastive loss) achieves a competitive\\noverall accuracy of 94.00\\\\%, with substantial improvements in nighttime\\nperformance (85.90\\\\% accuracy). The combination of Vision-SigLIP-2,\\nText-SigLIP-2, CycleGAN, and contrastive training achieves the best nighttime\\naccuracy (85.90\\\\%) among all models tested, while EVA-02 with CycleGAN\\nmaintains the highest overall accuracy (97.01\\\\%) and per-class accuracies.\\nThese findings demonstrate the potential of combining domain adaptation and\\nefficient contrastive learning to build practical, resource-efficient weather\\nclassification systems for intelligent transportation infrastructure.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T11:22:08Z\"}"}
