{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09973v1\", \"title\": \"Beyond Degradation Redundancy: Contrastive Prompt Learning for\\n  All-in-One Image Restoration\", \"summary\": \"All-in-one image restoration, addressing diverse degradation types with a\\nunified model, presents significant challenges in designing task-specific\\nprompts that effectively guide restoration across multiple degradation\\nscenarios. While adaptive prompt learning enables end-to-end optimization, it\\noften yields overlapping or redundant task representations. Conversely,\\nexplicit prompts derived from pretrained classifiers enhance discriminability\\nbut may discard critical visual information for reconstruction. To address\\nthese limitations, we introduce Contrastive Prompt Learning (CPL), a novel\\nframework that fundamentally enhances prompt-task alignment through two\\ncomplementary innovations: a \\\\emph{Sparse Prompt Module (SPM)} that efficiently\\ncaptures degradation-specific features while minimizing redundancy, and a\\n\\\\emph{Contrastive Prompt Regularization (CPR)} that explicitly strengthens task\\nboundaries by incorporating negative prompt samples across different\\ndegradation types. Unlike previous approaches that focus primarily on\\ndegradation classification, CPL optimizes the critical interaction between\\nprompts and the restoration model itself. Extensive experiments across five\\ncomprehensive benchmarks demonstrate that CPL consistently enhances\\nstate-of-the-art all-in-one restoration models, achieving significant\\nimprovements in both standard multi-task scenarios and challenging composite\\ndegradation settings. Our framework establishes new state-of-the-art\\nperformance while maintaining parameter efficiency, offering a principled\\nsolution for unified image restoration.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T08:24:57Z\"}"}
