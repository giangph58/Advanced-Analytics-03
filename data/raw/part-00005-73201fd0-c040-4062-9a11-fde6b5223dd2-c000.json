{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00318v1\", \"title\": \"FedEMA: Federated Exponential Moving Averaging with Negative Entropy\\n  Regularizer in Autonomous Driving\", \"summary\": \"Street Scene Semantic Understanding (denoted as S3U) is a crucial but complex\\ntask for autonomous driving (AD) vehicles. Their inference models typically\\nface poor generalization due to domain-shift. Federated Learning (FL) has\\nemerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing the generalization of AD models\\nthrough privacy-preserving distributed learning. However, these FL AD models\\nface significant temporal catastrophic forgetting when deployed in dynamically\\nevolving environments, where continuous adaptation causes abrupt erosion of\\nhistorical knowledge. This paper proposes Federated Exponential Moving Average\\n(FedEMA), a novel framework that addresses this challenge through two integral\\ninnovations: (I) Server-side model's historical fitting capability preservation\\nvia fusing current FL round's aggregation model and a proposed previous FL\\nround's exponential moving average (EMA) model; (II) Vehicle-side negative\\nentropy regularization to prevent FL models' possible overfitting to\\nEMA-introduced temporal patterns. Above two strategies empower FedEMA a\\ndual-objective optimization that balances model generalization and\\nadaptability. In addition, we conduct theoretical convergence analysis for the\\nproposed FedEMA. Extensive experiments both on Cityscapes dataset and Camvid\\ndataset demonstrate FedEMA's superiority over existing approaches, showing\\n7.12% higher mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU).\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T05:37:43Z\"}"}
