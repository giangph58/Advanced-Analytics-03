It is characterized by distinct single particle energies for the two\\nspin species, which interact with each other through a contact interaction in\\nmomentum space. We evaluate its spin structure factor exactly and follow the\\nevolution of its excitation spectrum for all fillings and interactions,\\nidentify signatures of the Mott transition and fingerprints of the asymmetric\\nhoppings. The longitudinal spin structure factor exhibits sound like and\\ninteraction induced gapped excitations, whose number gets doubled in the\\npresence of hopping asymmetry. The transverse response displays the competition\\nof interaction and asymmetry induced gaps and results in a quadratic excitation\\nbranch at their transition. The complete asymmetric case features\\nmomentum-independent dynamical structure factor, characteristic to transitions\\ninvolving a flat band.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T06:10:02Z\"}"}
