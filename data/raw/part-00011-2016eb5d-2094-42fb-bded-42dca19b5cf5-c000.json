We focus on\\nsynchronous, remote, and hybrid settings where people take part in tasks such\\nas data analysis, decision-making, and presentation. With this workshop, we\\ncontinue successful prior work from the first MERCADO workshop at VIS 2023 and\\na 2024 Shonan Seminar that followed. Based on the findings of the earlier\\nevents, we invite research and ideas related to four themes of challenges:\\nTools & Technologies, Individual Differences & Interpersonal Dynamics,\\nAI-assisted Collaboration, and Evaluation. With this workshop, we aim to\\nbroaden the community, foster new collaborations, and develop a research agenda\\nto address these challenges in future research. Our planned workshop format is\\ncomprised of a keynote, short presentations, a breakout group session, and\\ndiscussions organized around the identified challenges.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T12:54:54Z\"}"}
