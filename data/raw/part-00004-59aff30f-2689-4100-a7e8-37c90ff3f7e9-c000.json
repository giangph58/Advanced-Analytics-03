{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14970v1\", \"title\": \"Gapless behavior in a two-leg spin ladder with bond randomness\", \"summary\": \"We successfully synthesized\\n[Cu$_2$(AcO)$_4$($p$-Py-V-$p$-F)$_2$]$\\\\cdot$4CHCl$_3$, a verdazyl-based complex\\nwith a paddlewheel structure comprising two Cu atoms, which induces strong\\nantiferromagnetic (AF) exchange interactions between Cu spins, generating a\\nnonmagnetic singlet state at low temperatures. Two primary exchange\\ninteractions between radical spins generate a spin-1/2 AF two-leg ladder. In\\naddition, two possible positional configurations of the F atom in the complex\\ncreate four different overlap patterns of molecular orbitals, introducing bond\\nrandomness in the spin ladder. The observed experimental behaviors, such as the\\nCurie tail in the magnetic susceptibility and the gapless gradual increase in\\nthe magnetization curve, are attributed to a broad distribution of excitation\\nenergies and a few orphan spins in the random-singlet (RS) state that are\\nstabilized by bond randomness. The low-temperature specific heat exhibits a\\ntemperature dependence with $\\\\propto 1/|{\\\\rm{ln}}T|^3$, demonstrating the\\nformation of the RS state in unfrustrated systems. We also consider the effect\\nof restricted patterns of exchange interactions and one-dimensional nature of\\nthe system on the RS state.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T08:57:57Z\"}"}
