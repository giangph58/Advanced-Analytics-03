While a global route can be pre-computed\\noffline, real-time generation of adaptive local paths remains crucial.\\nTherefore, we present the Frenet Corridor Planner (FCP), an optimization-based\\nlocal path planning strategy for autonomous driving that ensures smooth and\\nsafe navigation around obstacles. Modeling the vehicles as safety-augmented\\nbounding boxes and pedestrians as convex hulls in the Frenet space, our\\napproach defines a drivable corridor by determining the appropriate deviation\\nside for static obstacles. Thereafter, a modified space-domain bicycle\\nkinematics model enables path optimization for smoothness, boundary clearance,\\nand dynamic obstacle risk minimization. The optimized path is then passed to a\\nspeed planner to generate the final trajectory. We validate FCP through\\nextensive simulations and real-world hardware experiments, demonstrating its\\nefficiency and effectiveness.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T17:00:32Z\"}"}
