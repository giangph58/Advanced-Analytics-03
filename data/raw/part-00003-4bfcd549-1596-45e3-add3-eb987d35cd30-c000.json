This\\nprovides a partial solution to an old problem posed by Littlewood.\\nConsequently, we obtain a positive answer to the analogous Erd\\\\\\\"{o}s--Newman\\nconjecture for polynomials with coefficients $\\\\pm 1$; that is, there is no\\nultraflat sequence of polynomials from the class of Erd\\\\\\\"{o}s--Littlewood\\npolynomials.\\n  Our proof is short and simple. It relies on the classical lemma for $L^p$\\nnorms of the Dirichlet kernel, the Marcinkiewicz--Zygmund interpolation\\ninequalities, and the $p$-concentration theorem due to A.
