{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00590v1\", \"title\": \"Unlocking the Potential of Linear Networks for Irregular Multivariate\\n  Time Series Forecasting\", \"summary\": \"Time series forecasting holds significant importance across various\\nindustries, including finance, transportation, energy, healthcare, and climate.\\nDespite the widespread use of linear networks due to their low computational\\ncost and effectiveness in modeling temporal dependencies, most existing\\nresearch has concentrated on regularly sampled and fully observed multivariate\\ntime series. However, in practice, we frequently encounter irregular\\nmultivariate time series characterized by variable sampling intervals and\\nmissing values. The inherent intra-series inconsistency and inter-series\\nasynchrony in such data hinder effective modeling and forecasting with\\ntraditional linear networks relying on static weights. To tackle these\\nchallenges, this paper introduces a novel model named AiT. AiT utilizes an\\nadaptive linear network capable of dynamically adjusting weights according to\\nobservation time points to address intra-series inconsistency, thereby\\nenhancing the accuracy of temporal dependencies modeling. Furthermore, by\\nincorporating the Transformer module on variable semantics embeddings, AiT\\nefficiently captures variable correlations, avoiding the challenge of\\ninter-series asynchrony. Comprehensive experiments across four benchmark\\ndatasets demonstrate the superiority of AiT, improving prediction accuracy by\\n11% and decreasing runtime by 52% compared to existing state-of-the-art\\nmethods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T15:24:48Z\"}"}
