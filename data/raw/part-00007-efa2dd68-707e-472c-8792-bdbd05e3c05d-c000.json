We study the evolution of hard ($4$-$150$ keV) and soft\\n($2$-$4$ keV) band photon count rates, the hardness ratio (HR), and QPO\\nfrequencies using daily observations from the HXMT/LE, ME, and HE instruments\\nbetween August 25 and October 5, 2023. The QPO frequency is found to be\\nstrongly correlated with the soft-band X-ray count rates, and spectral photon\\nindices. In contrast, a strong anti-correlation is observed between HR and QPO\\nfrequency, as well as between HR and photon index. Based on the evolution of\\nthe QPO frequency, the rising phase of the outburst is subdivided into six\\nparts, with parts 1-5 fitted using the propagating oscillatory shock (POS)\\nsolution to understand the nature of the evolution from a physical perspective.\\nThe best-fitted POS model is obtained with a black hole mass of\\n$13.34\\\\pm0.02~M_\\\\odot$. An inward-propagating shock with weakening strength\\n(except in part 4) is observed during the period of our study. The POS\\nmodel-fitted mass of the source is further confirmed using the QPO frequency\\n($\\\\nu$)-photon index ($\\\\Gamma$) scaling method. From this method, the estimated\\nprobable mass of Swift J1727.8-1613 is obtained to be $13.54\\\\pm1.87~M_\\\\odot$.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T03:37:58Z\"}"}
