In this paper we find\\na formula for the number of irreducible representations of $G$ of a given\\ndimension $n$ over the field of order $q$, up to equivalence, using Brauer\\ncharacters. We also provide a formula for such $n$ using the prime\\ndecomposition of the exponent of $G$ and an algorithm to compute the\\nirreducible degrees and their multiplicities.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GR\", \"categories\": \"math.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T09:34:05Z\"}"}
