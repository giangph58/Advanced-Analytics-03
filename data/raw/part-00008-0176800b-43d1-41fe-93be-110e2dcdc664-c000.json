{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20639v1\", \"title\": \"Multi-Message Secure Aggregation with Demand Privacy\", \"summary\": \"This paper considers a multi-message secure aggregation with privacy problem,\\nin which a server aims to compute $\\\\sf K_c\\\\geq 1$ linear combinations of local\\ninputs from $\\\\sf K$ distributed users. The problem addresses two tasks: (1)\\nsecurity, ensuring that the server can only obtain the desired linear\\ncombinations without any else information about the users' inputs, and (2)\\nprivacy, preventing users from learning about the server's computation task. In\\naddition, the effect of user dropouts is considered, where at most $\\\\sf{K-U}$\\nusers can drop out and the identity of these users cannot be predicted in\\nadvance. We propose two schemes for $\\\\sf K_c$ is equal to (1) and $\\\\sf 2\\\\leq\\nK_c\\\\leq U-1$, respectively. For $\\\\sf K_c$ is equal to (1), we introduce\\nmultiplicative encryption of the server's demand using a random variable, where\\nusers share coded keys offline and transmit masked models in the first round,\\nfollowed by aggregated coded keys in the second round for task recovery. For\\n$\\\\sf{2\\\\leq K_c \\\\leq U-1}$, we use robust symmetric private computation to\\nrecover linear combinations of keys in the second round. The objective is to\\nminimize the number of symbols sent by each user during the two rounds. Our\\nproposed schemes have achieved the optimal rate region when $ \\\\sf K_c $ is\\nequal to (1) and the order optimal rate (within 2) when $\\\\sf{2\\\\leq K_c \\\\leq\\nU-1}$.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T11:11:27Z\"}"}
