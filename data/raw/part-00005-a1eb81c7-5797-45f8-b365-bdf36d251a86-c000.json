We first\\nderive the dynamics constraint of the UAV and include it in the problem\\nformulation. MultiRRT is then developed, taking into account the cooperative\\nrequirements and safe constraints during its path-searching process. The\\nalgorithm features two new mechanisms, node reduction and Bezier interpolation,\\nto ensure the feasibility and optimality of the paths generated. Importantly,\\nthe interpolated paths are proven to meet the safety and dynamics constraints\\nimposed by obstacles and the UAVs. A number of simulations, comparisons, and\\nexperiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed\\napproach. The results show that MultiRRT can generate collision-free paths for\\nmultiple UAVs to reach their goals with better scores in path length and\\nsmoothness metrics than state-of-the-art RRT variants including Theta-RRT,\\nFN-RRT, RRT*, and RRT*-Smart. The generated paths are also tested in practical\\nflights with real UAVs to evaluate their validity for cooperative tasks.
