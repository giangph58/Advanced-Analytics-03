Leveraging the\\nLegacy COBOL 2024 Corpus -- 50,000 COBOL files from public and enterprise\\nsources -- Java parses the code, AI suggests upgrades, and React visualizes\\ngains. Achieving 93% accuracy, complexity drops 35% (from 18 to 11.7) and\\ncoupling 33% (from 8 to 5.4), surpassing manual efforts (75%) and rule-based\\ntools (82%). The approach offers a scalable path to rejuvenate COBOL systems,\\nvital for industries like banking and insurance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:07:54Z\"}"}
