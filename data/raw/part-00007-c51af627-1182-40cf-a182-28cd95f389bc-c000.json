We show that, also in this\\ntheory, the time derivative of the Ricci scalar couples with matter currents\\nand can preserve an unbalance in the baryon-antibaryon number beyond thermal\\nequilibrium. Using the current bounds on the ratio of baryon number to entropy\\ndensity, we can considerably improve the known constraints on the parameter q\\nthat characterizes the MEMe model. This estimate also allows us to draw\\nstringent constraints on the spatial curvature of the cosmological model.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T14:22:19Z\"}"}
