The effectiveness of\\nthe method is demonstrated on problems driven by nonlinear operators of the\\n$p$-Laplacian type, including the anisotropic $p$-Laplacian, polyharmonic\\n$p$-Laplacian, and fractional $p$-Laplacian.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,cs.NA,math.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T06:45:20Z\"}"}
