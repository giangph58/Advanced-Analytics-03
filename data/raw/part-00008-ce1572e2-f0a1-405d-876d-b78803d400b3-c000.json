{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03455v1\", \"title\": \"Mitigating Backdoor Triggered and Targeted Data Poisoning Attacks in\\n  Voice Authentication Systems\", \"summary\": \"Voice authentication systems remain susceptible to two major threats:\\nbackdoor triggered attacks and targeted data poisoning attacks. This dual\\nvulnerability is critical because conventional solutions typically address each\\nthreat type separately, leaving systems exposed to adversaries who can exploit\\nboth attacks simultaneously. We propose a unified defense framework that\\neffectively addresses both BTA and TDPA. Our framework integrates a frequency\\nfocused detection mechanism that flags covert pitch boosting and sound masking\\nbackdoor attacks in near real time, followed by a convolutional neural network\\nthat addresses TDPA. This dual layered defense approach utilizes\\nmultidimensional acoustic features to isolate anomalous signals without\\nrequiring costly model retraining. In particular, our PBSM detection mechanism\\ncan seamlessly integrate into existing voice authentication pipelines and scale\\neffectively for large scale deployments. Experimental results on benchmark\\ndatasets and their compression with the state of the art algorithm demonstrate\\nthat our PBSM detection mechanism outperforms the state of the art. Our\\nframework reduces attack success rates to as low as five to fifteen percent\\nwhile maintaining a recall rate of up to ninety five percent in recognizing\\nTDPA.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T11:52:12Z\"}"}
