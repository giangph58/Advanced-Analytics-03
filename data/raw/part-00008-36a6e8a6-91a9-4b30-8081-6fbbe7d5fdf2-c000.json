Among various experimental strategies,\\ncavity haloscopes currently offer the most sensitive method to detect axions,\\nthough their searches have largely been confined to axion masses below 10\\n$\\\\mu$eV. However, recent theoretical developments suggest that the axion mass\\nlies beyond this range. Higher-order cavity modes have been explored as a\\nmethodological approach to expand the search range, albeit with limited success\\nin achieving both high sensitivity and broad tunability. In this work, we\\npresent a sensitive search for axions with masses around 21 $\\\\mu$eV, utilizing\\nthe TM$_{020}$ mode of a cylindrical cavity, which incorporated an innovative\\ntuning mechanism. Our results reached 1.7 times the KSVZ sensitivity over 100\\nMHz, representing a significant improvement in this mass range and contributing\\nto the experimental search for axion dark matter at higher masses.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T09:48:02Z\"}"}
