Its CHA structure is defined in an explicit, combinatorial way,\\nby analogy with that of the CHA \\\\text{QSym} of quasisymmetric functions. And we\\ngive some subcoalgebra and Hopf subalgebras of \\\\text{ParQSym}, some gradings\\nand filtrations of \\\\text{ParSym} and \\\\text{ParQSym}, and some bases of\\n\\\\text{ParSym} and \\\\text{ParQSym} by analogy with some distinguished bases of\\n\\\\text{NSym} and \\\\text{QSym}.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RA\", \"categories\": \"math.RA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T10:45:30Z\"}"}
