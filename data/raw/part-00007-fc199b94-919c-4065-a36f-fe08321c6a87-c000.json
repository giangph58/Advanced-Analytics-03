We show that explicit incorporation of dispersion\\ninteractions via D2 and D3 corrections significantly improves the accuracy of\\nMLIPs when the cutoff radius is set to a commonly used value of 5 -- 6 \\\\r{A}.\\nWe also show that for carbon tetrachloride and methane, a substantial\\nimprovement in accuracy can be achieved by extending the cutoff radius to 7.5\\n\\\\r{A}. However, for accurate modeling of toluene, explicit incorporation of\\ndispersion remains important. Furthermore, we find that MLIPs incorporating\\ndispersion interactions via D2 reach a close level of accuracy to those\\nincorporating D3, and D2 is suitable for accurate modeling of the systems in\\nthe study, while being less computationally expensive. We evaluated the\\naccuracy of MLIPs in dimer binding curves compared to ab initio data and in\\npredicting density and radial distribution functions compared to experiments.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T10:11:54Z\"}"}
