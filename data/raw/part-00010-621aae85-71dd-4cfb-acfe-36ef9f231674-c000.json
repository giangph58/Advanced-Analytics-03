{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11350v1\", \"title\": \"Adaptive Compressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics\", \"summary\": \"Modulating the number of particles in a region is key to accurately capturing\\nthe nuances in compressible flows with Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH).\\nThis paper details the implementation of a volume-based adaptive refinement and\\nderefinement procedure, incorporating state-of-the-art features such as\\nautomatic local adaptivity and solution adaptivity. A shock-aware particle\\nshifting procedure is introduced to regularize the particle distribution while\\npreserving the integrity of shocks. To our knowledge, this is the first\\ndemonstration of shock-based solution adaptivity and shock-aware particle\\nshifting in the literature. A wide variety of test problems, which involve flow\\nin and around boundaries, are employed to highlight the utility of these\\nadaptivity features in improving the results and in making simulations faster.\\nFor instance, the adaptive resolution procedure is shown to deliver an order of\\nmagnitude speedup. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptivity\\nprocedure in resolving existing issues like errors due to interaction with\\ndifferently spaced ghost particles at boundaries, formation of spot-like\\nstructures due to particle clumping, and poorly resolved low-density regions.\\nIn essence, the adaptivity technique presented in this paper is positioned as a\\npowerful tool for simulating compressible flows with enhanced accuracy and\\nefficiency.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:22:01Z\"}"}
