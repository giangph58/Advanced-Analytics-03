{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02226v1\", \"title\": \"Error analysis of the diffuse domain finite element method for second\\n  order parabolic equations\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we analyze the diffuse domain finite element method (DDFE) to\\nsolve a class of second-order parabolic partial differential equations defined\\nin general irregular domains. The proposed method first applies the diffuse\\ndomain method (DDM) with a phase-field function to extend the target parabolic\\nequation to a similar problem defined over a larger rectangular domain that\\ncontains the original physical domain. The transformed equation is then\\ndiscretized by using the finite element method with continuous piecewise\\nmultilinear basis functions in space and the BDF2 scheme in time to produce a\\nfully discrete numerical scheme. Based on the weighted Sobolev spaces, we prove\\nthe convergence of the DDM solution to the original solution as the interface\\nthickness parameter goes to zero, with the corresponding approximation errors\\nunder the $L^2$ and $H^1$ norms. Furthermore, the optimal error estimate for\\nthe fully discrete DDFE scheme is also obtained under the $H^1$ norm. Various\\nnumerical experiments are finally carried out to validate the theoretical\\nresults and demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T02:48:16Z\"}"}
