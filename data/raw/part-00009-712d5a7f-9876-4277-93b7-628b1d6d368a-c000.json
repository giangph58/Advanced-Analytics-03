So far, atomistic models have been used to\\ncorroborate experimental results. However, such simulations do not provide a\\nsimple intuitive understanding of the underlying physics. Here, we propose a\\ncoarse-grained effective theory where skyrmions can be nucleated or annihilated\\nby thermal activation over energy barriers. Evaluating these two processes\\nduring a heat pulse shows good agreement with atomistic spin dynamics\\nsimulations and experiments while drastically reducing computational\\ncomplexity. Furthermore, the effective theory provides a direct guide for\\nexperimentally optimizing the number of nucleated skyrmions. Interestingly, the\\nmodel also predicts a novel pathway for ultrafast annihilation of skyrmions.\\nOur results pave the way for a deeper understanding of ultrafast nanomagnetism\\nand the role of non-equilibrium physics.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T09:34:15Z\"}"}
