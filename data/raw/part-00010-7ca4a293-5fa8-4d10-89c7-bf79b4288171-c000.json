{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12208v1\", \"title\": \"Servo-Controllers with Operational Constraints\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, a proportional-integral servo-control design method is\\ndeveloped for multi-input-multioutput linear time invariant systems with\\noperational constraints imposed on the system control input and on an output of\\nthe same dimension as the control input. The design is based on min-norm\\ncontrollers and Control Barrier Functions. It allows to enforce min/max box\\nconstraints by analytically solving Quadratic Programs for min-norm\\naugmentation controllers. The method provides an anti-windup protection for the\\ncontroller integrator state and enforces the desired operational control and\\noutput constraints, component-wise. A simulation example is given to illustrate\\npotential benefits of the proposed design methodology for aerial flight\\ncritical systems.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T15:55:55Z\"}"}
