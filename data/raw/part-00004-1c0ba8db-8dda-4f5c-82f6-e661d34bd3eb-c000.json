{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01799v1\", \"title\": \"A discussion on the origin of the sub-PeV Galactic gamma-ray emission\", \"summary\": \"Galactic diffuse gamma-ray flux measured by the Tibet AS{\\\\gamma} experiment\\nand the total Galactic gamma-ray flux measured by Large High Altitude Air\\nShower Observatory (LHAASO) are found to be consistent, within the statistical\\nand systematic uncertainties, for the inner Galactic Plane region in the\\nsub-PeV energy range (E > 10^14 eV). The result suggests that the sub-PeV\\nGalactic gamma-ray flux is dominated by the diffuse emission. On the other\\nhand, the LHAASO observations suggest that the sub-PeV gamma-ray sources\\npresented in the first LHAASO catalog possibly give a significant contribution\\nto the total sub-PeV Galactic gamma-ray emission ($\\\\approx$ 60%). However, the\\nestimate must be regarded as a conservative upper limit. In fact, current\\ngamma-ray observations imply that many of the sub-PeV gamma-ray sources\\ndetected by LHAASO have a cutoff or significant softening in their energy\\nspectra in the several tens of TeV energy range, and the resolved-source\\ncontribution to the total sub-PeV Galactic gamma-ray emission should be much\\nlower than the above estimate. More sophisticated discussion about the origin\\nof the sub-PeV Galactic gamma-ray emission requires detailed spectral studies\\nof the individual gamma-ray sources and an accurate estimate of the\\ncontamination of the source fluxes from the diffuse emission.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:09:22Z\"}"}
