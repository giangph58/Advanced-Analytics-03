In this paper, we present a novel communications-centric secure ISAC\\nframework capitalizing on the dual-functional capability of HRISs to realize\\nbistatic sensing simultaneously with secure downlink communications. In\\nparticular, we jointly optimize the BS precoding vector and the HRIS reflection\\nand analog combining configurations to enable simultaneous accurate estimation\\nof both a legitimate user and an eavesdropper, while guaranteeing a predefined\\nthreshold for the secrecy spectral efficiency, with both operations focused\\nwithin an area of interest. The presented simulation results validate the\\neffectiveness of the proposed secure ISAC design, highlighting the interplay\\namong key system design parameters as well as quantifying the trade-offs\\nbetween the HRIS's absorption and reflection coeffcients.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T10:18:15Z\"}"}
