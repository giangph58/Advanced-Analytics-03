To address these\\nissues, we propose a formal computational model of the NFT closed loop. Using\\nActive Inference, a Bayesian framework modelling perception, action, and\\nlearning, we simulate agents interacting with an NFT environment. This enables\\nus to test the impact of design choices (e.g., feedback quality, biomarker\\nvalidity) and subject factors (e.g., prior beliefs) on training. Simulations\\nshow that training effectiveness is sensitive to feedback noise or bias, and to\\nprior beliefs (highlighting the importance of guiding instructions), but also\\nreveal that perfect feedback is insufficient to guarantee high performance.\\nThis approach provides a tool for assessing and predicting NFT variability,\\ninterpret empirical data, and potentially develop personalized training\\nprotocols.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.NC\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.NC,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:41:31Z\"}"}
