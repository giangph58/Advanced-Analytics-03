{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09940v1\", \"title\": \"TianQuan-Climate: A Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Global Weather Model via\\n  Incorporate Climatology State\", \"summary\": \"Subseasonal forecasting serves as an important support for Sustainable\\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs), such as climate challenges, agricultural yield and\\nsustainable energy production. However, subseasonal forecasting is a complex\\ntask in meteorology due to dissipating initial conditions and delayed external\\nforces. Although AI models are increasingly pushing the boundaries of this\\nforecasting limit, they face two major challenges: error accumulation and\\nSmoothness. To address these two challenges, we propose Climate Furnace\\nSubseasonal-to-Seasonal (TianQuan-Climate), a novel machine learning model\\ndesigned to provide global daily mean forecasts up to 45 days, covering five\\nupper-air atmospheric variables at 13 pressure levels and two surface\\nvariables. Our proposed TianQuan-Climate has two advantages: 1) it utilizes a\\nmulti-model prediction strategy to reduce system error impacts in long-term\\nsubseasonal forecasts; 2) it incorporates a Content Fusion Module for\\nclimatological integration and extends ViT with uncertainty blocks (UD-ViT) to\\nimprove generalization by learning from uncertainty. We demonstrate the\\neffectiveness of TianQuan-Climate on benchmarks for weather forecasting and\\nclimate projections within the 15 to 45-day range, where TianQuan-Climate\\noutperforms existing numerical and AI methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T07:02:34Z\"}"}
