{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24275v1\", \"title\": \"Davenport-Heilbronn Function Ratio Properties and Non-Trivial Zeros\\n  Study\", \"summary\": \"This paper systematically investigates the analytic properties of the ratio\\n$f(s)/f(1-s) = X(s)$ based on the Davenport-Heilbronn functional equation $f(s)\\n= X(s)f(1-s)$. We propose a novel method to analyze the distribution of\\nnon-trivial zeros through the monotonicity of the ratio $|f(s)/f(1-s)|$.\\nRigorously proving that non-trivial zeros can only lie on the critical line\\n$\\\\sigma=1/2$, we highlight two groundbreaking findings: 1. Contradiction of\\nOff-Critical Zeros: Numerical \\\"exceptional zeros\\\" (e.g., Spira, 1994) violate\\nthe theoretical threshold $\\\\kappa=1.21164$ and conflict with the monotonicity\\nconstraint of $|X(s)|=1$. 2. Essential Difference Between Approximate and\\nStrict Zeros: Points satisfying $f(s) \\\\to 0$ do not constitute strict zeros\\nunless verified by analyticity. This work provides a new perspective for\\nstudying zero distributions of $L$-functions related to the Riemann Hypothesis.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT,math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:21:38Z\"}"}
