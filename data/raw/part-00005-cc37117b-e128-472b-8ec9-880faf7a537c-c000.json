{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19980v1\", \"title\": \"Deep Declarative Risk Budgeting Portfolios\", \"summary\": \"Recent advances in deep learning have spurred the development of end-to-end\\nframeworks for portfolio optimization that utilize implicit layers. However,\\nmany such implementations are highly sensitive to neural network\\ninitialization, undermining performance consistency. This research introduces a\\nrobust end-to-end framework tailored for risk budgeting portfolios that\\neffectively reduces sensitivity to initialization. Importantly, this enhanced\\nstability does not compromise portfolio performance, as our framework\\nconsistently outperforms the risk parity benchmark.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.PM\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.PM,q-fin.CP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:53:13Z\"}"}
