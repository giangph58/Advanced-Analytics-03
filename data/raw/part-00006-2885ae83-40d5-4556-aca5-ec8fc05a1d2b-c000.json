{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06757v1\", \"title\": \"Local equations describe unreasonably efficient stochastic algorithms in\\n  random K-SAT\", \"summary\": \"Despite significant advances in characterizing the highly nonconvex\\nlandscapes of constraint satisfaction problems, the good performance of certain\\nalgorithms in solving hard combinatorial optimization tasks remains poorly\\nunderstood. This gap in understanding stems largely from the lack of\\ntheoretical tools for analyzing their out-of-equilibrium dynamics. To address\\nthis challenge, we develop a system of approximate master equations that\\ncapture the behavior of local search algorithms in constraint satisfaction\\nproblems. Our framework shows excellent qualitative agreement with the phase\\ndiagrams of two paradigmatic algorithms: Focused Metropolis Search (FMS) and\\ngreedy-WalkSAT (G-WalkSAT) for random 3-SAT. The equations not only confirm the\\nnumerical observation that G-WalkSAT's algorithmic threshold is nearly\\nparameter-independent, but also successfully predict FMS's threshold beyond the\\nclustering transition. We also exploit these equations in a decimation scheme,\\ndemonstrating that the computed marginals encode valuable information about the\\nlocal structure of the solution space explored by stochastic algorithms.\\nNotably, our decimation approach achieves a threshold that surpasses the\\nclustering transition, outperforming conventional methods like Belief\\nPropagation-guided decimation. These results challenge the prevailing\\nassumption that long-range correlations are always necessary to describe\\nefficient local search dynamics and open a new path to designing efficient\\nalgorithms to solve combinatorial optimization problems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T10:20:31Z\"}"}
