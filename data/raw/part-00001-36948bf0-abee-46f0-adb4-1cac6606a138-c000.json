In our framework, vector valued\\nmeasures are modeled as probability measures on a product space $\\\\mathbb{R}^d\\n\\\\times G$, where $G$ is a weighted graph over a finite set of nodes and the\\ngraph geometry strongly influences the associated dynamic and static distances.\\nWe obtain sharp inequalities relating four notions of vector valued optimal\\ntransport and prove that the distances are mutually bi-H\\\\\\\"older equivalent. We\\ndiscuss the theoretical and practical advantages of each metric and indicate\\npotential applications in multispecies PDE and data analysis. In particular,\\none of the static formulations discussed in the paper is amenable to\\nlinearization, a technique that has been explored in recent years to accelerate\\nthe computation of pairwise optimal transport distances.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,cs.LG,math.MG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T16:10:03Z\"}"}
