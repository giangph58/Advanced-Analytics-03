{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07592v1\", \"title\": \"Hardness of 4-Colourings G-Colourable Graphs\", \"summary\": \"We study the complexity of a class of promise graph homomorphism problems.\\nFor a fixed graph H, the H-colouring problem is to decide whether a given graph\\nhas a homomorphism to H. By a result of Hell and Ne\\\\v{s}et\\\\v{r}il, this problem\\nis NP-hard for any non-bipartite loop-less graph H. Brakensiek and Guruswami\\n[SODA 2018] conjectured the hardness extends to promise graph homomorphism\\nproblems as follows: fix a pair of non-bipartite loop-less graphs G, H such\\nthat there is a homomorphism from G to H, it is NP-hard to distinguish between\\ngraphs that are G-colourable and those that are not H-colourable. We confirm\\nthis conjecture in the cases when both G and H are 4-colourable. This is a\\ncommon generalisation of previous results of Khanna, Linial, and Safra [Comb.\\n20(3): 393-415 (2000)] and of Krokhin and Opr\\\\v{s}al [FOCS 2019]. The result is\\nobtained by combining the algebraic approach to promise constraint satisfaction\\nwith methods of topological combinatorics and equivariant obstruction theory.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CC\", \"categories\": \"cs.CC,math.AT,math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T09:44:53Z\"}"}
