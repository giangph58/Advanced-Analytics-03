Self-energy and vacuum polarization graphs reveal\\nhow LIV effects transfer across sectors, influencing particle kinematics. Due\\nto these loop effects, constraints from cosmic-ray observations and other\\nEarth-based experiments impose limits on induced LIV parameters that would\\notherwise be less constrained. We show that while interaction-based LIV effects\\nrequire unrealistically large parameters for detection, modifications to\\ndispersion relations can be probed down to $\\\\delta \\\\sim 10^{-8} \\\\text{ to }\\n10^{-9}$ at the LHC. This suggests that accelerator-based resonance studies\\nprovide a promising avenue for stringent LIV constraints, potentially rivaling\\nastrophysical observations.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T05:58:04Z\"}"}
