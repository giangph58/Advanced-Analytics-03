Leveraging\\nthe geometric properties of Carleson blocks and the structure of radial\\ndoubling weights, we establish sharp estimates for the essential norm in terms\\nof the asymptotic behavior of $\\\\mu$ near the boundary. As a consequence, we\\nresolve the boundedness-to-compactness transition for these operators when $1 <\\nq < p<\\\\infty$, showing that the essential norm vanishes exactly. These results\\ngeneralize classical theorems for the unweighted Bergman space ($\\\\omega \\\\equiv\\n1$) and provide a unified framework for studying Toeplitz operators under both\\nradial and non-radial doubling weights in higher-dimensional settings.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T08:05:56Z\"}"}
