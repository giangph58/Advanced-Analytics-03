{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11985v1\", \"title\": \"A Heavy-Metal Scenario of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays\", \"summary\": \"The mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays is an open problem in\\nastroparticle physics. It is usually inferred from the depth of the shower\\nmaximum (Xmax) of cosmic-ray showers, which is only ambiguously determined by\\nmodern hadronic interaction models. We examine a data-driven scenario, in which\\nwe consider the expectation value of Xmax as a free parameter. We test the\\nnovel hypothesis whether the cosmic-ray data from the Pierre Auger Observatory\\ncan be interpreted in a consistent picture, under the assumption that the mass\\ncomposition of cosmic rays at the highest energies is dominated by high\\nmetallicity, resulting in pure iron nuclei at energies above ~40 EeV. We\\ninvestigate the implications on astrophysical observations and hadronic\\ninteractions, and we discuss the global consistency of the data assuming this\\nheavy-metal scenario. We conclude that the data from the Pierre Auger\\nObservatory can be interpreted consistently if the expectation values for Xmax\\nfrom modern hadronic interaction models are shifted to larger values.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T11:27:23Z\"}"}
