{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13058v1\", \"title\": \"Neurodiversity in Computing Education Research: A Systematic Literature\\n  Review\", \"summary\": \"Ensuring equitable access to computing education for all students-including\\nthose with autism, dyslexia, or ADHD-is essential to developing a diverse and\\ninclusive workforce. To understand the state of disability research in\\ncomputing education, we conducted a systematic literature review of research on\\nneurodiversity in computing education. Our search resulted in 1,943 total\\npapers, which we filtered to 14 papers based on our inclusion criteria. Our\\nmixed-methods approach analyzed research methods, participants, contribution\\ntypes, and findings. The three main contribution types included empirical\\ncontributions based on user studies (57.1%), opinion contributions and position\\npapers (50%), and survey contributions (21.4%). Interviews were the most common\\nmethodology (75% of empirical contributions). There were often inconsistencies\\nin how research methods were described (e.g., number of participants and\\ninterview and survey materials). Our work shows that research on\\nneurodivergence in computing education is still very preliminary. Most papers\\nprovided curricular recommendations that lacked empirical evidence to support\\nthose recommendations. Three areas of future work include investigating the\\nimpacts of active learning, increasing awareness and knowledge about\\nneurodiverse students' experiences, and engaging neurodivergent students in the\\ndesign of pedagogical materials and computing education research.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T16:13:31Z\"}"}
