{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07924v1\", \"title\": \"A Novel Graphyne-Like Carbon Allotrope: 2D Dewar-Anthracyne\", \"summary\": \"Anthracyne (2DDA). 2DDA consists of chains of Dewar-anthracenes connected by\\nacetylenic linkages. DFT-based simulations show that 2DDA is thermally stable\\nand exhibits no imaginary phonon modes, confirming its dynamic stability. 2DDA\\nis metallic with Dirac-like features near the Fermi level, dominated by C pz\\norbitals. It shows marked mechanical anisotropy, with Young's modulus of 176.24\\nN/m (x) and 31.51 N/m (y), shear modulus up to 69.14 N/m, and Poisson's ratio\\nvarying from 0.27 to 0.87. The material also exhibits strong anisotropic\\noptical absorption in the visible and ultraviolet ranges. Raman and IR spectra\\nreveal intense bands at 648 cm-1 (Raman) and 1292 cm-1 (Infrared). Nanoribbon\\nstructures derived from 2DDA exhibit diverse electronic behaviors, from metals\\nup to bandgap values of up to 0.42 eV, depending on the edge-type terminations\\nand width. These findings demonstrate the 2DDA potential for nanoelectronic and\\noptoelectronic applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.mes-hall,00-XX\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:40:47Z\"}"}
