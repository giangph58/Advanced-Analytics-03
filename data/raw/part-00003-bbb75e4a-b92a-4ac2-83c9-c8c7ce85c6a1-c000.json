{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10079v1\", \"title\": \"Hierarchical Relation-augmented Representation Generalization for\\n  Few-shot Action Recognition\", \"summary\": \"Few-shot action recognition (FSAR) aims to recognize novel action categories\\nwith few exemplars. Existing methods typically learn frame-level\\nrepresentations independently for each video by designing various inter-frame\\ntemporal modeling strategies. However, they neglect explicit relation modeling\\nbetween videos and tasks, thus failing to capture shared temporal patterns\\nacross videos and reuse temporal knowledge from historical tasks. In light of\\nthis, we propose HR2G-shot, a Hierarchical Relation-augmented Representation\\nGeneralization framework for FSAR, which unifies three types of relation\\nmodeling (inter-frame, inter-video, and inter-task) to learn task-specific\\ntemporal patterns from a holistic view. In addition to conducting inter-frame\\ntemporal interactions, we further devise two components to respectively explore\\ninter-video and inter-task relationships: i) Inter-video Semantic Correlation\\n(ISC) performs cross-video frame-level interactions in a fine-grained manner,\\nthereby capturing task-specific query features and learning intra- and\\ninter-class temporal correlations among support features; ii) Inter-task\\nKnowledge Transfer (IKT) retrieves and aggregates relevant temporal knowledge\\nfrom the bank, which stores diverse temporal patterns from historical tasks.\\nExtensive experiments on five benchmarks show that HR2G-shot outperforms\\ncurrent top-leading FSAR methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T10:23:22Z\"}"}
