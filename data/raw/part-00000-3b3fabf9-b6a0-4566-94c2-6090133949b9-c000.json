This information is gathered by an agent through observation, or based\\non a set of sources. Building intelligence only makes sense if you have\\nconfidence in it. To achieve this, it is necessary to estimate the confidence\\nin each piece of information gathered, taking into account the different\\ndimensions that can make it up: reliability of the source, competence,\\nplausibility of the information, credibility of the information, for example.\\nThe information gathered must then be combined with other information to\\nconsolidate an agent's knowledge. Recent advances have been made in the theory\\nunderlying the modeling of trust for decision-making based on uncertain\\ninformation, notably by using multivalued logic. This approach makes it\\npossible to deal with unknown values of trust-building parameters, or to easily\\nintegrate dimensions. In this article we present the problem of CTI and CTI\\ninformation sharing, and the reasons that led us to use a logic-based solution\\nfor an initial implementation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:17:26Z\"}"}
