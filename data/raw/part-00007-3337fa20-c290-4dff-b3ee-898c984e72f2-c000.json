The most common simulation approach is parametric simulation, where\\nthe data-generating mechanism (DGM) corresponds to a predefined parametric\\nmodel from which observations are drawn. Many statistical simulation studies\\naim to provide practical recommendations on a method's suitability for a given\\napplication; however, parametric simulations in particular are frequently\\ncriticized for being too simplistic and not reflecting reality. To overcome\\nthis drawback, it is generally considered a sensible approach to employ real\\ndata for constructing the parametric DGMs. However, while the concept of\\nreal-data-based parametric DGMs is widely recognized, the specific ways in\\nwhich DGM components are inferred from real data vary, and their implications\\nmay not always be well understood. Additionally, researchers often rely on a\\nlimited selection of real datasets, with the rationale for their selection\\noften unclear. This paper addresses these issues by formally discussing how\\ncomponents of parametric DGMs can be inferred from real data and how dataset\\nselection can be performed more systematically. By doing so, we aim to support\\nresearchers in conducting simulation studies with a lower risk of\\novergeneralization and misinterpretation. We illustrate the construction of\\nparametric DGMs based on a systematically selected set of real datasets using\\ntwo examples: one on ordinal outcomes in randomized controlled trials and one\\non differential gene expression analysis.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T09:19:28Z\"}"}
