At the pore scale,\\nthe flow is governed by the fully Navier-Stokes equations while the evolution\\nof the phase interface is captured by the Cahn-Hilliard equation. Using the\\nvolume averaging method, the upscaled equations describing the averaged\\nbehavior of two fluids at the Darcy scale are obtained, with unclosed terms\\nrelated to spatial deviations. Then, spatial derivations are carefully modeled\\nup to some undetermined coefficients, which could be evaluated by solving\\nsimplified closure problems in each representative volume element. In\\nparticular, the wetting behavior is incorporated into the averaged chemical\\npotential. The differences between the proposed equations and the empirical\\ntwo-phase Darcy-type models are discussed. Finally, a phase-field-based lattice\\nBoltzmann model for the averaged equations is presented, and numerical results\\ndemonstrate the abilities of the proposed model.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn,math-ph,math.MP,physics.comp-ph,physics.geo-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T16:16:19Z\"}"}
