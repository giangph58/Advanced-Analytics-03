Furthermore, based on higher homotopy groups\\nof spheres, we predict the existence of multifold HEPs and symmetry-protected\\nHEPs with non-Hermitian topology captured by a range of finite groups (such as\\n$\\\\mathbb{Z}_3$, $\\\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, or $\\\\mathbb{Z}_{24}$) beyond the periodic\\ntable of Bernard-LeClair symmetry classes.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,physics.optics,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T15:19:05Z\"}"}
