{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12004v1\", \"title\": \"Scaled Block Vecchia Approximation for High-Dimensional Gaussian Process\\n  Emulation on GPUs\", \"summary\": \"Emulating computationally intensive scientific simulations is essential to\\nenable uncertainty quantification, optimization, and decision-making at scale.\\nGaussian Processes (GPs) offer a flexible and data-efficient foundation for\\nstatistical emulation, but their poor scalability limits applicability to large\\ndatasets. We introduce the Scaled Block Vecchia (SBV) algorithm for distributed\\nGPU-based systems. SBV integrates the Scaled Vecchia approach for anisotropic\\ninput scaling with the Block Vecchia (BV) method to reduce computational and\\nmemory complexity while leveraging GPU acceleration techniques for efficient\\nlinear algebra operations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\\ndistributed implementation of any Vecchia-based GP variant. Our implementation\\nemploys MPI for inter-node parallelism and the MAGMA library for\\nGPU-accelerated batched matrix computations. We demonstrate the scalability and\\nefficiency of the proposed algorithm through experiments on synthetic and\\nreal-world workloads, including a 50M point simulation from a respiratory\\ndisease model. SBV achieves near-linear scalability on up to 64 A100 and GH200\\nGPUs, handles 320M points, and reduces energy use relative to exact GP solvers,\\nestablishing SBV as a scalable and energy-efficient framework for emulating\\nlarge-scale scientific models on GPU-based distributed systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T11:57:20Z\"}"}
