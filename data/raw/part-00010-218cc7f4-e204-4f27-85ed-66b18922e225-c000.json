{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05468v1\", \"title\": \"A Solovay-Kitaev theorem for quantum signal processing\", \"summary\": \"Quantum signal processing (QSP) studies quantum circuits interleaving known\\nunitaries (the phases) and unknown unitaries encoding a hidden scalar (the\\nsignal). For a wide class of functions one can quickly compute the phases\\napplying a desired function to the signal; surprisingly, this ability can be\\nshown to unify many quantum algorithms. A separate, basic subfield in quantum\\ncomputing is gate approximation: among its results, the Solovay-Kitaev theorem\\n(SKT) establishes an equivalence between the universality of a gate set and its\\nability to efficiently approximate other gates.\\n  In this work we prove an 'SKT for QSP,' showing that the density of\\nparameterized circuit ans\\\\\\\"atze in classes of functions implies the existence\\nof short circuits approximating desired functions. This is quite distinct from\\na pointwise application of the usual SKT, and yields a suite of independently\\ninteresting 'lifted' variants of standard SKT proof techniques. Our method\\nfurnishes alternative, flexible proofs for results in QSP, extends simply to\\nans\\\\\\\"atze for which standard QSP proof methods fail, and establishes a formal\\nintersection between QSP and gate approximation.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T17:58:07Z\"}"}
