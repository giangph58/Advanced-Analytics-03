We investigated the dependence of\\nsplitting of the superfluid transition temperature of $^3$He in aerogel on\\nmagnetic field. In addition to our previous work, we used a wider range of\\nmagnetic fields (up to 31 kOe) and managed to detect both the \\\"upper\\\" and\\n\\\"lower\\\" superfluid transition temperatures. The solid paramagnetic $^3$He layer\\non the aerogel strands activates the magnetic scattering channel. According to\\ntheory, it should result in linear splitting at high ($\\\\ge20$ kOe) fields,\\nwhile at lower fields the splitting is expected to be nonlinear. We were able\\nto observe this nonlinearity, but we have a discrepancy with theoretical\\npredictions regarding the range of fields where nonlinearity occurs. Possible\\nreasons for this are discussed.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.other\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T05:16:09Z\"}"}
