This method involves the architect's close collaboration\\nwith LLM-fueled tooling over the whole process. The architect is guided through\\nDomain Model creation, Use Case specification, architectural decisions, and\\narchitecture evaluation. While the architect can take complete control of the\\nprocess and the results, and use the tooling as a building set, they can follow\\nthe intended process for maximum tooling support. The preliminary results\\nsuggest the feasibility of this process and indicate major time savings for the\\narchitect.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE,cs.AI,D.2.2\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T15:46:56Z\"}"}
