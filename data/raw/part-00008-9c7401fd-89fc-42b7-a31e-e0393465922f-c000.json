{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12143v1\", \"title\": \"ARCeR: an Agentic RAG for the Automated Definition of Cyber Ranges\", \"summary\": \"The growing and evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats necessitates the\\ndevelopment of supporting tools and platforms that allow for the creation of\\nrealistic IT environments operating within virtual, controlled settings as\\nCyber Ranges (CRs). CRs can be exploited for analyzing vulnerabilities and\\nexperimenting with the effectiveness of devised countermeasures, as well as\\nserving as training environments for building cyber security skills and\\nabilities for IT operators. This paper proposes ARCeR as an innovative solution\\nfor the automatic generation and deployment of CRs, starting from user-provided\\ndescriptions in a natural language. ARCeR relies on the Agentic RAG paradigm,\\nwhich allows it to fully exploit state-of-art AI technologies. Experimental\\nresults show that ARCeR is able to successfully process prompts even in cases\\nthat LLMs or basic RAG systems are not able to cope with. Furthermore, ARCeR is\\nable to target any CR framework provided that specific knowledge is made\\navailable to it.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T14:53:28Z\"}"}
