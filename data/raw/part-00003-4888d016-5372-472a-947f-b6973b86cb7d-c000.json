This\\nleads to a new proof of the irrationality of $\\\\zeta_2(5)$, the result\\nestablished recently by Calegari, Dimitrov and Tang using a different method.\\nFurthermore, our approximations allow us to obtain an upper bound for the\\nirrationality measure of this $2$-adic quantity; namely, we show that\\n$\\\\mu(\\\\zeta_2(5)) \\\\le (16\\\\log2)/(8\\\\log2-5) = 20.342\\\\dots$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT,math.AG,math.CA,math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T07:22:25Z\"}"}
