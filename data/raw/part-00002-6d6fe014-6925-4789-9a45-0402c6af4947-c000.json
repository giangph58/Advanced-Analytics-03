Within a\\nperturbative description of initial-state fluctuations in the quark-gluon\\nplasma, we express the measurement of anisotropic flow in ultra-central\\nheavy-ion collisions as the quantum-mechanical average of a specific set of\\noperators measuring the harmonic structure of the two-body azimuthal\\ncorrelations among nucleons in the colliding states. These observables shed a\\nnew light on spatial correlations in atomic nuclei, while enabling us to test\\nthe complementary pictures of nuclear structure delivered by low- and\\nhigh-energy experiments on the basis of state-of-the-art theoretical approaches\\nrooted in quantum chromodynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,hep-ex,hep-ph,nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T10:59:21Z\"}"}
