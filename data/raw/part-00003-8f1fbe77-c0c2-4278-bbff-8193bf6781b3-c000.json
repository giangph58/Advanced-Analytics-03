It is unclear whether\\nsuch strategic information disclosure can lead to good societal outcomes. To\\naddress this question, we consider a competitive Bayesian persuasion model in\\nwhich multiple agents selectively disclose information about their qualities to\\na principal, who aims to choose the candidates with the highest qualities.\\nUsing the price-of-anarchy framework, we quantify the inefficiency of such\\nstrategic disclosure. We show that the price of anarchy is at most a constant\\nwhen the agents have independent quality distributions, even if their utility\\nfunctions are heterogeneous. This result provides the first theoretical\\nguarantee on the limits of inefficiency in Bayesian persuasion with competitive\\ninformation disclosure.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GT\", \"categories\": \"cs.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:46:13Z\"}"}
