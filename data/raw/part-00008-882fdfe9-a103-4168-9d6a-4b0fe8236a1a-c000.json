The source exhibited\\nstrong X-ray variability and showed type-C quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs)\\non a wide range of frequencies. The high data quality over a broad range of\\nX-ray energies (0.5-150 keV) enables us to study the energy-dependence of the\\nQPO waveform and the phase lags at the QPO fundamental and second harmonic\\nfrequencies. Using the biphase, we find that the QPO waveform is strongly\\nenergy-dependent, with energy bands below and above 15-20 keV showing opposite\\nwaveform evolution. We interpret the energy-dependence of the waveform as being\\ndue to a pivoting spectral component at the second harmonic frequency, with a\\npivot energy around 15-20 keV. Using the cross-spectrum, we find that the phase\\nlags between energy bands above 7 keV at the QPO fundamental are small, while\\nthose at the harmonic frequency are dominated by a separate lag component that\\nextends over a broader range of frequencies and relates to the broadband noise\\nvariability. Comparing the energy-dependent results obtained with the\\nbispectrum and the cross-spectrum, we show that these two Fourier products\\nextract different variability components, e.g. the QPO and the broadband noise,\\nat the same frequencies. Finally, we compare Swift J1727.8-1613 to BHXRB MAXI\\nJ1535-571 and find that their spectral-timing properties are similar,\\nindicating that these QPO properties may represent a subset of sources.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T08:50:58Z\"}"}
