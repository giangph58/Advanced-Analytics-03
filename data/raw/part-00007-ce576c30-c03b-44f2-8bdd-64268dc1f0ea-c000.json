{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20827v1\", \"title\": \"DP-SMOTE: Integrating Differential Privacy and Oversampling Technique to\\n  Preserve Privacy in Smart Homes\", \"summary\": \"Smart homes represent intelligent environments where interconnected devices\\ngather information, enhancing users living experiences by ensuring comfort,\\nsafety, and efficient energy management. To enhance the quality of life,\\ncompanies in the smart device industry collect user data, including activities,\\npreferences, and power consumption. However, sharing such data necessitates\\nprivacy-preserving practices. This paper introduces a robust method for secure\\nsharing of data to service providers, grounded in differential privacy (DP).\\nThis empowers smart home residents to contribute usage statistics while\\nsafeguarding their privacy. The approach incorporates the Synthetic Minority\\nOversampling technique (SMOTe) and seamlessly integrates Gaussian noise to\\ngenerate synthetic data, enabling data and statistics sharing while preserving\\nindividual privacy. The proposed method employs the SMOTe algorithm and applies\\nGaussian noise to generate data. Subsequently, it employs a k-anonymity\\nfunction to assess reidentification risk before sharing the data. The\\nsimulation outcomes demonstrate that our method delivers strong performance in\\nsafeguarding privacy and in accuracy, recall, and f-measure metrics. This\\napproach is particularly effective in smart homes, offering substantial utility\\nin privacy at a reidentification risk of 30%, with Gaussian noise set to 0.3,\\nSMOTe at 500%, and the application of a k-anonymity function with k = 2.\\nAdditionally, it shows a high classification accuracy, ranging from 90% to 98%,\\nacross various classification techniques.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:50:50Z\"}"}
