However, using foveated rendering to reduce temporal\\nresolution, i.e., rendering frame rate, seems less explored. In this work, we\\npresent the results of a user study investigating the perceptual effects of\\nfoveated temporal resolution reduction, where only the temporal resolution\\n(frame rate) is reduced in the periphery without affecting spatial quality\\n(pixel density). In particular, we investigated the perception of temporal\\nresolution artifacts caused by reducing the frame rate dependent on the\\neccentricity of the user's gaze. Our user study with 15 participants was\\nconducted in a virtual reality setting using a head-mounted display. Our\\nresults indicate that it was possible to reduce average rendering costs, i.e.,\\nthe number of rendered pixels, to a large degree before participants\\nconsistently reported perceiving temporal artifacts.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T16:27:47Z\"}"}
