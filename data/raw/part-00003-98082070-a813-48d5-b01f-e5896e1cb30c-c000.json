Both the space-time white noise ($d=1$)\\nand the trace-class noise in multiple dimensions $d=2,3$ are examined for the\\nconsidered SPDEs. Based on a spectral Galerkin spatial semi-discretization, we\\npropose a class of novel full-discretization schemes of exponential type, which\\nare explicit, easily implementable and preserve the ergodicity of the original\\ndissipative SPDEs with possibly non-contractive coefficients. The\\nuniform-in-time weak approximation errors are carefully analyzed in a low\\nregularity and non-contractive setting, with uniform-in-time weak convergence\\nrates obtained. A key ingredient is to establish the uniform-in-time moment\\nbounds (in $L^{4q-2}$-norm, $q \\\\geq 1$) for the proposed fully discrete schemes\\nin a super-linear setting. This is highly non-trivial for the explicit\\nfull-discretization schemes and new arguments are elaborated by fully\\nexploiting a contractive property of the semi-group in $L^{4q-2}$, the\\ndissipativity of the nonlinearity and the particular benefit of the taming\\nstrategy. Numerical experiments are finally reported to verify the theoretical\\nfindings.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T06:52:23Z\"}"}
