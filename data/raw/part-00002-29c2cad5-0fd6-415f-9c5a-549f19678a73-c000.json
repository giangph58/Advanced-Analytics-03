We apply an ensemble approach to KANs to\\nobtain a heuristic measure of UQ, enhancing interpretability and robustness in\\nmodeling complex functions. Building on this, we introduce Conformalized-KANs,\\nwhich integrate conformal prediction, a distribution-free UQ technique, with\\nKAN ensembles to generate calibrated prediction intervals with guaranteed\\ncoverage. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the\\neffectiveness of these methods, focusing particularly on the robustness and\\naccuracy of the prediction intervals under various hyperparameter settings. We\\nshow that the conformal KAN predictions can be applied to recent extensions of\\nKANs, including Finite Basis KANs (FBKANs) and multifideilty KANs (MFKANs). The\\nresults demonstrate the potential of our approaches to improve the reliability\\nand applicability of KANs in scientific machine learning.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T17:14:05Z\"}"}
