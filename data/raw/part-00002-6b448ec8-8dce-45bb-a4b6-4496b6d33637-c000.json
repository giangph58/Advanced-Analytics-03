Here,\\nwe present a structured way to improve the quality of these high-dimensional\\nemulated outputs, through the use of prototypes: an approximation of the\\nemulator's output passed as an input, which informs the model and leads to\\nbetter predictions. We demonstrate our approach to emulate atmospheric\\ndispersion, key for greenhouse gas emissions monitoring, by comparing a\\nbaseline model to models trained using prototypes as an additional input. The\\nprototype models achieve better performance, even with few prototypes and even\\nif they are chosen at random, but we show that choosing the prototypes through\\ndata-driven methods (k-means) can lead to almost 10\\\\% increased performance in\\nsome metrics.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T12:34:23Z\"}"}
