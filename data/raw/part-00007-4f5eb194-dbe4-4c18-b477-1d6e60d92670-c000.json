This approach introduces a novel saddle point formulation for\\nthe minimizing movement schemes, leveraging a support function form from the\\nBenamou-Brenier dynamical formulation of optimal transport. The resulting\\nframework allows for flexible computation of Wasserstein-like gradient flows by\\nsolving the corresponding saddle point problem at the fully discrete level, and\\ncan be easily extended to handle general nonlinear mobilities. We also provide\\na detailed convergence analysis of the PDFB splitting method, along with\\npractical remarks on its implementation and application. The effectiveness of\\nthe method is demonstrated through several challenging numerical examples.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T07:37:08Z\"}"}
