To quantify the dissipation dynamics, we employ a\\ntransformer-based machine learning algorithm to analyze gene expression data,\\nincorporating age as a token to assess how age-related dissipation is reflected\\nin the embedding space. By evaluating the dynamics of gene and age embeddings,\\nwe provide a cellular aging map (CAM) and identify patterns indicative of\\ndivergence in gene embedding space, nonlinear transitions, and entropy\\nvariations during aging for various tissues and cell types. Our results provide\\na novel perspective on aging as a dissipative process and introduce a\\ncomputational framework that enables measuring age-related changes with\\nmolecular resolution.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.QM\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.QM,cs.LG,physics.bio-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T15:59:15Z\"}"}
