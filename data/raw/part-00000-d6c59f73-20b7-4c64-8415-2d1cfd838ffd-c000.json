{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02781v1\", \"title\": \"Towards Green AI-Native Networks: Evaluation of Neural Circuit Policy\\n  for Estimating Energy Consumption of Base Stations\", \"summary\": \"Optimization of radio hardware and AI-based network management software yield\\nsignificant energy savings in radio access networks. The execution of\\nunderlying Machine Learning (ML) models, which enable energy savings through\\nrecommended actions, may require additional compute and energy, highlighting\\nthe opportunity to explore and adopt accurate and energy-efficient ML\\ntechnologies. This work evaluates the novel use of sparsely structured Neural\\nCircuit Policies (NCPs) in a use case to estimate the energy consumption of\\nbase stations. Sparsity in ML models yields reduced memory, computation and\\nenergy demand, hence facilitating a low-cost and scalable solution. We also\\nevaluate the generalization capability of NCPs in comparison to traditional and\\nwidely used ML models such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), via quantifying\\ntheir sensitivity to varying model hyper-parameters (HPs). NCPs demonstrated a\\nclear reduction in computational overhead and energy consumption. Moreover,\\nresults indicated that the NCPs are robust to varying HPs such as number of\\nepochs and neurons in each layer, making them a suitable option to ease model\\nmanagement and to reduce energy consumption in Machine Learning Operations\\n(MLOps) in telecommunications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.NE,eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T17:22:39Z\"}"}
