Yet,\\nnone of the currently available stochastic models are both accurate and\\ncomputationally efficient for long-term predictions of large systems. The\\nLinear Noise Approximation (LNA) model for biochemical reaction networks is\\nanalytically tractable, which makes it computationally efficient for\\nsimulation, analysis, and inference. However, it is only accurate for linear\\nsystems and short-time transitions. Other methods can achieve greater accuracy\\nacross a wider range of systems, including non-linear ones, but lack analytical\\ntractability. This paper seeks to challenge the prevailing view by\\ndemonstrating that the Linear Noise Approximation can indeed capture non-linear\\ndynamics after certain modifications. We introduce a new framework that\\nutilises centre manifold theory allowing us to identify simple interventions to\\nthe LNA that do not significantly compromise its computational efficiency. We\\ndevelop specific algorithms for systems that exhibit oscillations or\\nbi-stability and demonstrate their accuracy and computational efficiency across\\nmultiple examples.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.QM\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.QM,math.PR,physics.chem-ph,q-bio.MN\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T15:16:30Z\"}"}
