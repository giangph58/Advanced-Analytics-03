{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07658v1\", \"title\": \"UWB Anchor Based Localization of a Planetary Rover\", \"summary\": \"Localization of an autonomous mobile robot during planetary exploration is\\nchallenging due to the unknown terrain, the difficult lighting conditions and\\nthe lack of any global reference such as satellite navigation systems. We\\npresent a novel approach for robot localization based on ultra-wideband (UWB)\\ntechnology. The robot sets up its own reference coordinate system by\\ndistributing UWB anchor nodes in the environment via a rocket-propelled\\nlauncher system. This allows the creation of a localization space in which UWB\\nmeasurements are employed to supplement traditional SLAM-based techniques. The\\nsystem was developed for our involvement in the ESA-ESRIC challenge 2021 and\\nthe AMADEE-24, an analog Mars simulation in Armenia by the Austrian Space Forum\\n(\\\\\\\"OWF).\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T11:15:47Z\"}"}
