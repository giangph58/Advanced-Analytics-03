{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21552v1\", \"title\": \"The First Theoretical Approximation Guarantees for the Non-Dominated\\n  Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III)\", \"summary\": \"This work conducts a first theoretical analysis studying how well the\\nNSGA-III approximates the Pareto front when the population size $N$ is less\\nthan the Pareto front size. We show that when $N$ is at least the number $N_r$\\nof reference points, then the approximation quality, measured by the maximum\\nempty interval (MEI) indicator, on the OneMinMax benchmark is such that there\\nis no empty interval longer than $\\\\lceil\\\\frac{(5-2\\\\sqrt2)n}{N_r-1}\\\\rceil$. This\\nbound is independent of $N$, which suggests that further increasing the\\npopulation size does not increase the quality of approximation when $N_r$ is\\nfixed. This is a notable difference to the NSGA-II with sequential survival\\nselection, where increasing the population size improves the quality of the\\napproximations. We also prove two results indicating approximation difficulties\\nwhen $N<N_r$. These theoretical results suggest that the best setting to\\napproximate the Pareto front is $N_r=N$. In our experiments, we observe that\\nwith this setting the NSGA-III computes optimal approximations, very different\\nfrom the NSGA-II, for which optimal approximations have not been observed so\\nfar.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NE\", \"categories\": \"cs.NE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T11:49:42Z\"}"}
