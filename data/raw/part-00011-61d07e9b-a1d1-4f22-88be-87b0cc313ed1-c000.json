{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01405v1\", \"title\": \"Teaching Robots to Handle Nuclear Waste: A Teleoperation-Based Learning\\n  Approach<\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents a Learning from Teleoperation (LfT) framework that\\nintegrates human expertise with robotic precision to enable robots to\\nautonomously perform skills learned from human operators. The proposed\\nframework addresses challenges in nuclear waste handling tasks, which often\\ninvolve repetitive and meticulous manipulation operations. By capturing\\noperator movements and manipulation forces during teleoperation, the framework\\nutilizes this data to train machine learning models capable of replicating and\\ngeneralizing human skills. We validate the effectiveness of the LfT framework\\nthrough its application to a power plug insertion task, selected as a\\nrepresentative scenario that is repetitive yet requires precise trajectory and\\nforce control. Experimental results highlight significant improvements in task\\nefficiency, while reducing reliance on continuous operator involvement.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T06:46:29Z\"}"}
