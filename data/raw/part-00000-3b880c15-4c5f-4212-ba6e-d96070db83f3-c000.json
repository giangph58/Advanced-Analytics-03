{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24306v1\", \"title\": \"Point Tracking in Surgery--The 2024 Surgical Tattoos in Infrared (STIR)\\n  Challenge\", \"summary\": \"Understanding tissue motion in surgery is crucial to enable applications in\\ndownstream tasks such as segmentation, 3D reconstruction, virtual tissue\\nlandmarking, autonomous probe-based scanning, and subtask autonomy. Labeled\\ndata are essential to enabling algorithms in these downstream tasks since they\\nallow us to quantify and train algorithms. This paper introduces a point\\ntracking challenge to address this, wherein participants can submit their\\nalgorithms for quantification. The submitted algorithms are evaluated using a\\ndataset named surgical tattoos in infrared (STIR), with the challenge aptly\\nnamed the STIR Challenge 2024. The STIR Challenge 2024 comprises two\\nquantitative components: accuracy and efficiency. The accuracy component tests\\nthe accuracy of algorithms on in vivo and ex vivo sequences. The efficiency\\ncomponent tests the latency of algorithm inference. The challenge was conducted\\nas a part of MICCAI EndoVis 2024. In this challenge, we had 8 total teams, with\\n4 teams submitting before and 4 submitting after challenge day. This paper\\ndetails the STIR Challenge 2024, which serves to move the field towards more\\naccurate and efficient algorithms for spatial understanding in surgery. In this\\npaper we summarize the design, submissions, and results from the challenge. The\\nchallenge dataset is available here: https://zenodo.org/records/14803158 , and\\nthe code for baseline models and metric calculation is available here:\\nhttps://github.com/athaddius/STIRMetrics\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:53:09Z\"}"}
