XXIII.\\n  The powering mechanisms of the Ly$\\u03b1$ haloes around high-$z$ quasars\\n  probed by slit spectroscopy\", \"summary\": \"We present the analysis of Ly$\\\\alpha$ haloes around faint quasars at $z\\\\sim4$\\nand $z\\\\sim6$. We use 20 and 162 quasars at $z\\\\sim4$ and $z\\\\sim6$, taken by slit\\nspectroscopy, and detect Ly$\\\\alpha$ haloes around 12 and 26 of these quasars,\\nrespectively. The average absolute magnitudes of the detected quasars are\\n$\\\\langle M_{1450} \\\\rangle = -23.84$ mag at $z\\\\sim4$ and $\\\\langle M_{1450}\\n\\\\rangle = -23.68$ mag at $z\\\\sim6$, which are comparable at $z\\\\sim4$ and 3 mag\\nfainter at $z\\\\sim6$ than those of previous studies. The median surface\\nbrightness profiles are found to be consistent with an exponential curve,\\nshowing a hint of flattening within a radius of 5 kpc. The Ly$\\\\alpha$ haloes\\naround these faint quasars are systematically fainter than those around bright\\nquasars in the previous studies. We confirm the previous results that the\\nLy$\\\\alpha$ halo luminosity depends on both the ionizing and Ly$\\\\alpha$ peak\\nluminosities of quasars at $z\\\\sim4$, and also find that a similar correlation\\nholds even at $z\\\\sim6$. While the observed Ly$\\\\alpha$ halo luminosity is\\noverall attributed to recombination emission from the optically thin gas clouds\\nin the CGM, its luminosity dependences can be consistently explained by the\\npartial contributions of recombination radiation from the optically thick\\nclouds, which is thought to originate from the CGM centre, and the scattered\\nLy$\\\\alpha$ photons, which is resonantly trapped at the CGM centre and escaping\\noutside of the haloes.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:40:29Z\"}"}
