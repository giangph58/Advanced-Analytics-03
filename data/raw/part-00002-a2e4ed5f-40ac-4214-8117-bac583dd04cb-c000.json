{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05914v1\", \"title\": \"High-Resource Translation:Turning Abundance into Accessibility\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents a novel approach to constructing an English-to-Telugu\\ntranslation model by leveraging transfer learning techniques and addressing the\\nchallenges associated with low-resource languages. Utilizing the Bharat\\nParallel Corpus Collection (BPCC) as the primary dataset, the model\\nincorporates iterative backtranslation to generate synthetic parallel data,\\neffectively augmenting the training dataset and enhancing the model's\\ntranslation capabilities. The research focuses on a comprehensive strategy for\\nimproving model performance through data augmentation, optimization of training\\nparameters, and the effective use of pre-trained models. These methodologies\\naim to create a robust translation system that can handle diverse sentence\\nstructures and linguistic nuances in both English and Telugu. This work\\nhighlights the significance of innovative data handling techniques and the\\npotential of transfer learning in overcoming limitations posed by sparse\\ndatasets in low-resource languages. The study contributes to the field of\\nmachine translation and seeks to improve communication between English and\\nTelugu speakers in practical contexts.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T11:09:51Z\"}"}
