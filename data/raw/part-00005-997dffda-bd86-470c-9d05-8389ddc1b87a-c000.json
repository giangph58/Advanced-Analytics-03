{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15818v1\", \"title\": \"Uniqueness of Parisi measures for enriched convex vector spin glass\", \"summary\": \"In the PDE approach to mean-field spin glasses, it has been observed that the\\nfree energy of convex spin glass models could be enriched by adding an extra\\nparameter in its definition, and that the thermodynamic limit of the enriched\\nfree energy satisfies a partial differential equation. This parameter can be\\nthought of as a matrix-valued path, and the usual free energy is recovered by\\nsetting this parameter to be the constant path taking only the value $0$.\\nFurthermore, the enriched free energy can be expressed using a variational\\nformula, which is a natural extension of the Parisi formula for the usual free\\nenergy. For models with scalar spins the Parisi formula can be expressed as an\\noptimization problem over a convex set, and it was shown in [arXiv:1402.5132]\\nthat this problem has a unique optimizer thanks to a strict convexity property.\\nFor models with vector spins, the Parisi formula cannot easily be written as a\\nconvex optimization problem. In this paper, we generalize the uniqueness of\\nParisi measures proven in [arXiv:1402.5132] to the enriched free energy of\\nmodels with vector spins when the extra parameter is a strictly increasing\\npath. Our approach relies on a Gateaux differentiability property of the free\\nenergy and the envelope theorem.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T12:03:46Z\"}"}
