First, a remarkable\\nFriedmann-Lema\\\\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric solution that is\\ncompletely independent of the matter-energy compositions of the universe is\\nfound. Second, based on the FLRW solution as well as the perturbation\\nequations, a numerical code calculating the CMB temperature power spectrum is\\nbuilt. We find that though the FLRW solution can mimic the evolution of the\\nuniverse in the standard $\\\\Lambda$CDM model, the calculated CMB temperature\\npower spectrum shows unavoidable discrepancies from the CMB power spectrum\\nmeasurements.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T15:06:38Z\"}"}
