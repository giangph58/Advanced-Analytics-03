{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00355v1\", \"title\": \"Attitude Control of Spacecraft for Autonomous Attenuation of Unknown\\n  Periodic Disturbance Torque\", \"summary\": \"Recently, deep space exploration, especially focusing on halo orbits, the\\nperiodic orbits of the Moon, has been widely studied. The spacecraft in halo\\norbits performs periodic orbital motion, which affects the attitude motion by\\nperiodic disturbances. The conventional attitude control method, PD control, is\\nwidely used, but its application to periodic disturbance attenuation is\\ninefficient. To address these challenges, this study proposes a predictive\\nRepetitive Control (RC) approach that addresses periodic disturbances,\\nparticularly GG torque, by exploiting the periodic nature of the system\\ndynamics. The proposed method is also applied to the case of using a Reaction\\nWheel (RW) as an attitude control actuator. Despite the inherent challenges\\nposed by RW limitations, including saturation torque and transmission delay,\\nour predictive RC approach effectively mitigates these effects. Numerical\\nsimulations demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed method in\\nmaintaining attitude control for spacecraft traversing halo orbits near the\\nEarth-Moon $L_2$ point, validating its potential for future deep space\\nexploration missions.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T07:00:19Z\"}"}
