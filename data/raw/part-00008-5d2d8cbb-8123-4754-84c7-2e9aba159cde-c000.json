Multiple search algorithms exist to detect the signals\\nfrom compact binary coalescences, but their varying performance complicates\\ninterpretation. We present a machine learning-driven approach that combines\\nresults from individual pipelines and utilises conformal prediction to provide\\nrobust, calibrated uncertainty quantification. Using simulations, we\\ndemonstrate improved detection efficiency and apply our model to GWTC-3,\\nenhancing confidence in multi-pipeline detections, such as the sub-threshold\\nbinary neutron star candidate GW200311_103121.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:18:09Z\"}"}
