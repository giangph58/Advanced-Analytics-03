{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05334v1\", \"title\": \"Forecasting Thai inflation from univariate Bayesian regression\\n  perspective\", \"summary\": \"This study investigates the forecasting performance of Bayesian shrinkage\\npriors in predicting Thai inflation in a univariate setup, with a particular\\ninterest in comparing those more advance shrinkage prior to a likelihood\\ndominated/noninformative prior. Our forecasting exercises are evaluated using\\nRoot Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Quantile-Weighted Continuous Ranked Probability\\nScores (qwCRPS), and Log Predictive Likelihood (LPL). The empirical results\\nreveal several interesting findings: SV-augmented models consistently\\nunderperform compared to their non-SV counterparts, particularly in large\\npredictor settings. Notably, HS, DL and LASSO in large-sized model setting\\nwithout SV exhibit superior performance across multiple horizons. This\\nindicates that a broader range of predictors captures economic dynamics more\\neffectively than modeling time-varying volatility. Furthermore, while left-tail\\nrisks (deflationary pressures) are well-controlled by advanced priors (HS, HS+,\\nand DL), right-tail risks (inflationary surges) remain challenging to forecast\\naccurately. The results underscore the trade-off between model complexity and\\nforecast accuracy, with simpler models delivering more reliable predictions in\\nboth normal and crisis periods (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic). This study\\ncontributes to the literature by highlighting the limitations of SV models in\\nhigh-dimensional environments and advocating for a balanced approach that\\ncombines advanced shrinkage techniques with broad predictor coverage. These\\ninsights are crucial for policymakers and researchers aiming to enhance the\\nprecision of inflation forecasts in emerging economies.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.EM\", \"categories\": \"econ.EM\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:25:05Z\"}"}
