This places certain restrictions on its application regarding the\\nallowable atom-plate separation distances and the dielectric properties of the\\nplate material. Below we demonstrate that in some recent literature the\\napplication conditions of the Lifshitz theory established by its founders are\\nviolated by applying it at too short separations and using the dielectric\\npermittivities possessing the negative imaginary parts in violation of the\\nsecond law of thermodynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T11:51:13Z\"}"}
