In this work, we analyze the geodesic motion of\\nmassive particles in a Kerr-like polymer spacetime, incorporating quantum\\ncorrections via a parameter $A_\\\\lambda$. We demonstrate that increasing\\n$A_\\\\lambda$ allows for additional orbital evolution in extreme mass ratio\\ninspiral (EMRI) systems before merging. Our results show that the radii,\\nenergy, and angular momentum of both the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO)\\nand marginal circular orbit (MCO) decrease as $A_\\\\lambda$ increases.\\nFurthermore, when the primary object becomes a wormhole, both prograde ISCO and\\nMCO can intersect the transition surface at the wormhole throat and vanish as\\n$A_\\\\lambda$ grows. Additionally, we find that the eccentricity of periodic\\ngeodesic motion decreases monotonically with increasing $A_\\\\lambda$. Finally,\\nwe explore the variation of the rational number that characterizes periodic\\nmotion and highlight the influence of the quantum parameter on different types\\nof periodic orbits, classified by a set of integers associated with the\\nrational number. This work contributes to the understanding of quantum gravity\\neffects and offers potential observational signatures, particularly in the\\nstudy of EMRIs.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T10:26:30Z\"}"}
