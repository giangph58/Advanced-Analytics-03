{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07693v1\", \"title\": \"Molecular nature of hidden-charm pentaquark states $P_{c\\\\bar{c}s}$ with\\n  strangeness $S=-1$\", \"summary\": \"We investigate the hidden-charm pentaquark states with strangeness $S=-1$\\n($P_{c\\\\bar{c}s}$) within an off-shell coupled-channel approach based on\\neffective Lagrangians that respect heavy-quark spin symmetry, SU(3) flavor\\nsymmetry, and hidden local symmetry. All relevant meson-baryon two-body\\nchannels composed of low-lying anti-charmed mesons and singly-charmed baryons\\nwith $S=-1$, as well as the $J/\\\\psi \\\\Lambda$ channel, are included. We find a\\ntotal of eleven negative-parity states and three positive-parity states. AMong\\nthe negative-parity states, the $P_{c\\\\bar{c}s}(4338)$ and $P_{c\\\\bar{c}s}(4459)$\\ncan be naturally interpreted as $\\\\bar{D} \\\\Xi_c$ and $\\\\bar{D}^* \\\\Xi_c$ molecular\\nstates, respectively. We identify a second state, $P_{c\\\\bar{c}s}(4472)$,\\nlocated close to the $P_{c\\\\bar{c}s}(4459)$ but with different spin and width,\\nwhich may correspond to the structure observed by the Belle Collaboration. Both\\nstates are generated from the $\\\\bar{D}^* \\\\Xi_c$ channel and can be interpreted\\nas spin partners. Their properties are consistent with recent experimental\\nobservations, providing strong support for the molecular interpretation of the\\n$P_{c\\\\bar{c}s}$ states. We also observe a two-pole structure near the\\n$\\\\bar{D}_s^* \\\\Lambda_c$ and $\\\\bar{D}^* \\\\Xi_c'$ channel depending on\\nspin-parity.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T12:26:39Z\"}"}
