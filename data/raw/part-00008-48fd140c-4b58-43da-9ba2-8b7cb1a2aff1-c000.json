Existing remote sensing\\ntechniques often lack precision in complex urban environments due to the\\nabsence of ground-level details. Unlike aerial perspectives, street view images\\nprovide a ground-level view that captures more human and social activities\\nrelevant to land use in complex urban scenes. Existing street view-based\\nmethods primarily rely on supervised classification, which is challenged by the\\nscarcity of high-quality labeled data and the difficulty of generalizing across\\ndiverse urban landscapes. This study introduces an unsupervised contrastive\\nclustering model for street view images with a built-in geographical prior, to\\nenhance clustering performance. When combined with a simple visual assignment\\nof the clusters, our approach offers a flexible and customizable solution to\\nland use mapping, tailored to the specific needs of urban planners. We\\nexperimentally show that our method can generate land use maps from geotagged\\nstreet view image datasets of two cities. As our methodology relies on the\\nuniversal spatial coherence of geospatial data (\\\"Tobler's law\\\"), it can be\\nadapted to various settings where street view images are available, to enable\\nscalable, unsupervised land use mapping and updating.
