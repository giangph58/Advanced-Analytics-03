Complementarity constraints and control\\nbarrier functions (CBF) have emerged as core tools for ensuring such safety\\nconstraints, and each represents a well-developed field. Despite addressing\\nsimilar problems, their connection remains largely unexplored. This paper\\nbridges this gap by formally proving the equivalence between these two\\nmethodologies for sampled-data, first-order systems, considering both single\\nand multiple constraint scenarios. By demonstrating this equivalence, we\\nprovide a unified perspective on these techniques. This unification has\\ntheoretical and practical implications, facilitating the cross-application of\\nrobustness guarantees and algorithmic improvements between complementarity and\\nCBF frameworks. We discuss these synergistic benefits and motivate future work\\nin the comparison of the methods in more general cases.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:17:26Z\"}"}
