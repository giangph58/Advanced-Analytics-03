Such a\\nsuperoperator is called a pre-channel since it is an extension of a quantum\\nchannel to a wider class of operators without requirements of trace-preserving\\nand positivity. Instead of the sum of i.i.d. variables there may be considered\\nthe composition of random semigroups $e^{A_i t/n}$ in the Banach space\\n$\\\\mathcal{T}_p$. The law of large numbers is known in the case $p=2$ in the\\nform of the usual law of large numbers for random operators in a Hilbert space.\\nWe obtain the law of large numbers for the case $1\\\\leqslant p \\\\leqslant 2$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:35:48Z\"}"}
