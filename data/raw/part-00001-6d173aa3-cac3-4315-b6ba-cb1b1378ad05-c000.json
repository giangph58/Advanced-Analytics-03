{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12186v1\", \"title\": \"CoMotion: Concurrent Multi-person 3D Motion\", \"summary\": \"We introduce an approach for detecting and tracking detailed 3D poses of\\nmultiple people from a single monocular camera stream. Our system maintains\\ntemporally coherent predictions in crowded scenes filled with difficult poses\\nand occlusions. Our model performs both strong per-frame detection and a\\nlearned pose update to track people from frame to frame. Rather than match\\ndetections across time, poses are updated directly from a new input image,\\nwhich enables online tracking through occlusion. We train on numerous image and\\nvideo datasets leveraging pseudo-labeled annotations to produce a model that\\nmatches state-of-the-art systems in 3D pose estimation accuracy while being\\nfaster and more accurate in tracking multiple people through time.
