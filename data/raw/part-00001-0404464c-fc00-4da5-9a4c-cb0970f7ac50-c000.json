We introduce the Visual Bias Explorer (ViBEx) to interactively\\nexplore the output space of T2I models to support the discovery of visual bias.\\nViBEx introduces a novel flexible prompting tree interface in combination with\\nzero-shot bias probing using CLIP for quick and approximate bias exploration.\\nIt additionally supports in-depth confirmatory bias analysis through visual\\ninspection of forward, intersectional, and inverse bias queries. ViBEx is\\nmodel-agnostic and publicly available. In four case study interviews, experts\\nin AI and ethics were able to discover visual biases that have so far not been\\ndescribed in literature.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T11:57:23Z\"}"}
