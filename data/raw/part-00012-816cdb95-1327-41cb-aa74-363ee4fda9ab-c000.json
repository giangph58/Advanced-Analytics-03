{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10381v1\", \"title\": \"Abstract simplicial complexes in {\\\\tt Macaulay2}\", \"summary\": \"{\\\\tt AbstractSimplicialComplexes.m2} is a computer algebra package written\\nfor the computer algebra system {\\\\tt Macaulay2} \\\\cite{M2}. It provides new\\ninfrastructure to work with abstract simplicial complexes and related\\nhomological constructions. Its key novel feature is to implement each given\\nabstract simplicial complex as a certain graded list in the form of a hash\\ntable with integer keys. Among other features, this allows for a direct\\nimplementation of the associated reduced and non-reduced simplicial chain\\ncomplexes. Further, it facilitates construction of random simplicial complexes.\\nThe approach that we employ here builds on the {\\\\tt Macaulay2} package {\\\\tt\\nComplexes.m2} \\\\cite{Stillman:Smith:Complexes.m2}. It complements and is\\nentirely different from the existing {\\\\tt Macaulay2} simplicial complexes\\nframework that is made possible by the package {\\\\tt SimplicialComplexes.m2}\\n\\\\cite{Smith:et:al:SimplicialComplexes.m2:jsag}.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG,math.AC,math.AT,math.CO,math.KT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:25:50Z\"}"}
