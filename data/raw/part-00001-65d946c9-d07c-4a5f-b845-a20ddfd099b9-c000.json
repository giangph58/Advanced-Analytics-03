In this paper, we consider a helicity-dependent version of\\nthe same process: we study the double-spin asymmetry for inclusive\\nquark-antiquark dijet production in longitudinally polarized electron-proton\\nscattering at high energies. We show that in the back-to-back limit this\\nprocess probes the WW gluon helicity TMD. Furthermore, we derive the small-$x$\\nevolution equation for the operator related to the WW gluon helicity\\ndistribution. We find that in the double-logarithmic approximation and in the\\nlarge-$N_c$ limit, the small-$x$ asymptotics of the WW gluon helicity\\ndistribution is governed by exactly the same evolution equation as that for the\\ndipole gluon helicity distribution. The longitudinal double-spin asymmetry for\\ninclusive dijet production in the longitudinally polarized electron-proton\\ncollisions can thus test the small-$x$ helicity evolution equations and\\nfacilitate constraining the initial conditions for phenomenology based on these\\nequations.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T14:32:05Z\"}"}
