However,\\nadapting these models to local health systems remains challenging due to\\nlimited data availability and resource constraints. In this study, we\\ninvestigated what these models learn and evaluated the transferability of an FM\\ntrained on MIMIC-IV to an institutional EHR dataset at the University of\\nChicago Medical Center. We assessed their ability to identify outlier patients\\nand examined representation-space patient trajectories in relation to future\\nclinical outcomes. We also evaluated the performance of supervised fine-tuned\\nclassifiers on both source and target datasets. Our findings offer insights\\ninto the adaptability of FMs across different healthcare systems, highlight\\nconsiderations for their effective implementation, and provide an empirical\\nanalysis of the underlying factors that contribute to their predictive\\nperformance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:09:05Z\"}"}
