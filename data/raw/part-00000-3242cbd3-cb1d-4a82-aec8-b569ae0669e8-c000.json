However, such extreme sparsity\\nlevels limit the seamless usage of ToF depth in SLAM. In this work, we propose\\nToF-Splatting, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting-based SLAM pipeline tailored for\\nusing effectively very sparse ToF input data. Our approach improves upon the\\nstate of the art by introducing a multi-frame integration module, which\\nproduces dense depth maps by merging cues from extremely sparse ToF depth,\\nmonocular color, and multi-view geometry. Extensive experiments on both\\nsynthetic and real sparse ToF datasets demonstrate the viability of our\\napproach, as it achieves state-of-the-art tracking and mapping performances on\\nreference datasets.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T09:19:43Z\"}"}
