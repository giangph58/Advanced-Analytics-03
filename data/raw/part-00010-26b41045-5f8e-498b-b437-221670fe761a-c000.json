{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16915v1\", \"title\": \"DreamO: A Unified Framework for Image Customization\", \"summary\": \"Recently, extensive research on image customization (e.g., identity, subject,\\nstyle, background, etc.) demonstrates strong customization capabilities in\\nlarge-scale generative models. However, most approaches are designed for\\nspecific tasks, restricting their generalizability to combine different types\\nof condition. Developing a unified framework for image customization remains an\\nopen challenge. In this paper, we present DreamO, an image customization\\nframework designed to support a wide range of tasks while facilitating seamless\\nintegration of multiple conditions. Specifically, DreamO utilizes a diffusion\\ntransformer (DiT) framework to uniformly process input of different types.\\nDuring training, we construct a large-scale training dataset that includes\\nvarious customization tasks, and we introduce a feature routing constraint to\\nfacilitate the precise querying of relevant information from reference images.\\nAdditionally, we design a placeholder strategy that associates specific\\nplaceholders with conditions at particular positions, enabling control over the\\nplacement of conditions in the generated results. Moreover, we employ a\\nprogressive training strategy consisting of three stages: an initial stage\\nfocused on simple tasks with limited data to establish baseline consistency, a\\nfull-scale training stage to comprehensively enhance the customization\\ncapabilities, and a final quality alignment stage to correct quality biases\\nintroduced by low-quality data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the\\nproposed DreamO can effectively perform various image customization tasks with\\nhigh quality and flexibly integrate different types of control conditions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T17:41:44Z\"}"}
