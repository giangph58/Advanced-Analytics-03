The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) technique\\nis employed, utilizing the unitary coupled-cluster method with singles and\\ndoubles (UCCSD) within active spaces extracted from the larger material system.\\nWe explore active spaces of (6e,6o), (10e,10o), and (12e,12o), corresponding to\\n12, 20, and 24 qubits, respectively, and simulate them using CUDA-Q's\\nGPU-accelerated state-vector simulator. Notably, the 24-qubit simulations --\\namong the largest of their kind to date -- are enabled by gate fusion\\noptimizations available in CUDA-Q. While these active space sizes are among the\\nlargest reported in the context of CO2 chemisorption, they remain insufficient\\nfor a fully accurate study of the system. This limitation arises from necessary\\nsimplifications and scalability challenges of VQE, particularly the barren\\nplateau problem. Nonetheless, this work demonstrates the application of VQE to\\na novel material system using large-scale simulated QPUs and offers a blueprint\\nfor future quantum chemistry calculations.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T11:35:21Z\"}"}
