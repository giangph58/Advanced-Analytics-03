{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19646v1\", \"title\": \"xEdgeFace: Efficient Cross-Spectral Face Recognition for Edge Devices\", \"summary\": \"Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR) addresses the challenge of matching face\\nimages across different sensing modalities, such as thermal to visible or\\nnear-infrared to visible, expanding the applicability of face recognition\\nsystems in real-world, unconstrained environments. While recent HFR methods\\nhave shown promising results, many rely on computation-intensive architectures,\\nlimiting their practicality for deployment on resource-constrained edge\\ndevices. In this work, we present a lightweight yet effective HFR framework by\\nadapting a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture originally designed for face\\nrecognition. Our approach enables efficient end-to-end training with minimal\\npaired heterogeneous data while preserving strong performance on standard RGB\\nface recognition tasks. This makes it a compelling solution for both\\nhomogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios. Extensive experiments across multiple\\nchallenging HFR and face recognition benchmarks demonstrate that our method\\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining a low\\ncomputational overhead.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T10:03:11Z\"}"}
