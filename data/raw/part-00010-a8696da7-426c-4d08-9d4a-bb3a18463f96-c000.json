We investigated two automation paradigms by designing and\\nimplementing a fully automated copilot (AutoCopilot) and a semi-automated\\ncopilot (GuidedCopilot) that automates trivial steps while offering\\nstep-by-step visual guidance. In a user study (N=20) across data analysis and\\nvisual design tasks, GuidedCopilot outperformed AutoCopilot in user control,\\nsoftware utility, and learnability, especially for exploratory and creative\\ntasks, while AutoCopilot saved time for simpler visual tasks. A follow-up\\ndesign exploration (N=10) enhanced GuidedCopilot with task-and state-aware\\nfeatures, including in-context preview clips and adaptive instructions. Our\\nfindings highlight the critical role of user control and tailored guidance in\\ndesigning the next generation of copilots that enhance productivity, support\\ndiverse skill levels, and foster deeper software engagement.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T03:11:10Z\"}"}
