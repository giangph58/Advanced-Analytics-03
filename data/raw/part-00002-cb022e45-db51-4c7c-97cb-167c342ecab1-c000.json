{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00460v1\", \"title\": \"Subspace-Distance-Enabled Active Learning for Efficient Data-Driven\\n  Model Reduction of Parametric Dynamical Systems\", \"summary\": \"In situations where the solution of a high-fidelity dynamical system needs to\\nbe evaluated repeatedly, over a vast pool of parametric configurations and in\\nabsence of access to the underlying governing equations, data-driven model\\nreduction techniques are preferable. We propose a novel active learning\\napproach to build a parametric data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) by\\ngreedily picking the most important parameter samples from the parameter\\ndomain. As a result, during the ROM construction phase, the number of\\nhigh-fidelity solutions dynamically grow in a principled fashion. The\\nhigh-fidelity solution snapshots are expressed in several parameter-specific\\nlinear subspaces, with the help of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and\\nthe relative distance between these subspaces is used as a guiding mechanism to\\nperform active learning. For successfully achieving this, we provide a distance\\nmeasure to evaluate the similarity between pairs of linear subspaces with\\ndifferent dimensions, and also show that this distance measure is a metric. The\\nusability of the proposed subspace-distance-enabled active learning (SDE-AL)\\nframework is demonstrated by augmenting two existing non-intrusive\\nreduced-order modeling approaches, and providing their active-learning-driven\\n(ActLearn) extensions, namely, SDE-ActLearn-POD-KSNN, and SDE-ActLearn-POD-NN.\\nFurthermore, we report positive results for two parametric physical models,\\nhighlighting the efficiency of the proposed SDE-AL approach.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.CE,cs.LG,cs.NA,math.DS,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T11:28:18Z\"}"}
