We prove that every\\neigenvalue of the linearized problem is a bifurcation point, extending the\\nknown result for simple eigenvalues to the general case of eigenvalues of any\\nmultiplicity. We also obtain a lower bound on the number of bifurcating\\nsolutions. The proof is based on the Hamiltonian structure of the problem and\\non the variational argument of constrained critical points for traveling waves\\nof Craig and Nicholls (2000, SIAM J. Math. Anal. 32, 323-359), adapted to the\\nnearly spherical geometry; in particular, the role of the action functional is\\nplayed here by the angular momentum with respect to the rotation axis.\\nMoreover, the bifurcation equation presents a 2-dimensional degeneration,\\nrelated to some symmetries of the physical problem. This additional difficulty\\nis overcome thanks to a crucial transversality property, obtained by using the\\nHamiltonian structure and the prime integrals corresponding to those symmetries\\nby Noether theorem, which are the fluid mass and the component along the\\nrotation axis of the velocity of the fluid barycenter.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T09:54:20Z\"}"}
