The approach is\\nbased on the Markov chain coupling method, which is frequently used to prove\\nfast mixing. Given a particular coupling, e.g., a grand coupling, we construct\\na completely positive and trace preserving map. This quantum map has a unique\\nfixed point, which corresponds to the quantum sample (qsample) of the classical\\nMarkov chain's stationary distribution. We show that the convergence time of\\nthe quantum map is directly related to the coupling time of the Markov chain\\ncoupling.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:48:47Z\"}"}
