To our knowledge, the earliest\\nRenaissance book containing the image of this polyhedron is \\\"La Pratica di\\nProspettiva\\\" published in 1596 by Florentine architect and perspective artist\\nLorenzo Sirigatti. We described an outline of Sirigatti life and the importance\\nof his book for scientists and artists, Galileo Galilei among them. We depict\\nexamples of lamps and lanterns in European cities shaped as the truncated\\nelongated octagonal bipyramid, as well as a drawing by Raphael with a lantern\\nof a similar form. Finally, we discussed why the artist chose this particular\\npolyhedron for his drawing.\", \"main_category\": \"math.HO\", \"categories\": \"math.HO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T11:33:41Z\"}"}
