{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21832v1\", \"title\": \"Optimal Dynamic Control of Bounded Jacobian Discrete-Time Systems via\\n  Interval Observers\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents an optimal dynamic control framework for bounded Jacobian\\nnonlinear discrete-time (DT) systems with nonlinear observations affected by\\nboth state and process noise. Rather than directly stabilizing the uncertain\\nsystem, we focus on stabilizing an interval observer in a higher dimensional\\nspace, whose states bound the true system states. Our nonlinear dynamic control\\nmethod introduces added flexibility over traditional static and linear\\napproaches, effectively compensating for system nonlinearities and enabling\\npotentially tighter closed-loop intervals. Additionally, we establish a\\nseparation principle that allows for the design of observer and control gains.\\nWe further derive tractable matrix inequalities to ensure system stability in\\nthe closed-loop configuration. The simulation results show that the proposed\\ndynamic control approach significantly outperforms a static counterpart method.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:39:09Z\"}"}
