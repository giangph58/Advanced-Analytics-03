To train our model, we introduce a dataset of 3D objects\\nannotated with detailed physical material attributes, along with an annotation\\npipeline for efficient material annotation. Our method enables applications\\nsuch as text-driven generation of interactive, physics-aware 3D objects and\\nsingle-image reconstruction of physically plausible shapes. Furthermore, our\\nexperiments demonstrate that jointly modeling shape and material properties\\nenhances the realism and fidelity of generated shapes, improving performance on\\ngenerative geometry evaluation metrics.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GR\", \"categories\": \"cs.GR,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T06:17:24Z\"}"}
