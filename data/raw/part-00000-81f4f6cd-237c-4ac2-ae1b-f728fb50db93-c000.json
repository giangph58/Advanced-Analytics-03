Here we employ electron and synchrotron\\nX-ray beams, individually, to investigate the radiation-induced instability of\\ntwo types of OIHP single crystals (FAPbBr3 and MAPbBr3). Under the electron\\nbeam, we observe that 3-point star-style cracks grow on the surface of FAPbBr3,\\nand bricklayer-style cracks are formed on the surface of MAPbBr3. Under the\\nX-ray beam, a new composition without organic components appears in both\\nFAPbBr3 and MAPbBr3. Such cracking and composition changes are attributed to\\nthe volatilization of organic components. We propose a volume-strain-based\\nmechanism, in which the energy conversion results from the organic cation loss.\\nUsing nanoindentation, we reveal that beam radiations reduce the Youngs modulus\\nand increase the hardness of both OIHPs. This study provides valuable insights\\ninto the structural and mechanical stabilities of OIHP single crystals in\\nradiation environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T17:10:46Z\"}"}
