{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02722v1\", \"title\": \"Dynamic Directional Routing of Freight in the Physical Internet\", \"summary\": \"The Physical Internet (PI) envisions an interconnected, modular, and\\ndynamically managed logistics system inspired by the Digital Internet. It\\nenables open-access networks where shipments traverse a hyperconnected system\\nof hubs, adjusting routes based on real-time conditions. A key challenge in\\nscalable and adaptive freight movement is routing determining how shipments\\nnavigate the network to balance service levels, consolidation, and\\nadaptability. This paper introduces directional routing, a dynamic approach\\nthat flexibly adjusts shipment paths, optimizing efficiency and consolidation\\nusing real-time logistics data. Unlike shortest-path routing, which follows\\nfixed routes, directional routing dynamically selects feasible next-hop hubs\\nbased on network conditions, consolidation opportunities, and service level\\nconstraints. It consists of two phases: area discovery, which identifies\\ncandidate hubs, and node selection, which determines the next hub based on\\nreal-time parameters. This paper advances the area discovery phase by\\nintroducing a Reduced Search Space Breadth-First Search (RSS-BFS) method to\\nsystematically identify feasible routing areas while balancing service levels\\nand consolidation. The proposed approach enhances network fluidity,\\nscalability, and adaptability in PI-based logistics, advancing autonomous and\\nsustainable freight movement.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T16:05:03Z\"}"}
