The most salient feature of the new\\napproach is that the space and time discrete equations of the numerical method\\ncan be obtained as the optimality conditions of a single incremental potential.\\nThe governing equations define a gradient flow of the mass in the domain that\\nmaximizes the stiffness of the proposed solid, while exactly preserving the\\nmass of the allocated material. Moreover, we propose a change of variables in\\nthe model equations that constrains the value of the density within admissible\\nbounds and a continuation strategy that speeds up the evolution of the flow.\\nThe proposed strategy results in a robust and efficient topology optimization\\nmethod that is exactly mass-preserving, does not employ Lagrange multipliers,\\nand is fully variational.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T11:42:54Z\"}"}
