Let ${\\\\cal A}_{\\\\ell}$ be the family of graphs of girth at least\\n$2\\\\ell$ and having no odd holes of length at least $2\\\\ell+3$, let ${\\\\cal\\nB}_{\\\\ell}$ be the triangle-free graphs which have no 5-holes and no odd holes\\nof length at least $2\\\\ell+3$, and let ${\\\\cal G}_{\\\\ell}$ be the family of graphs\\nof girth $2\\\\ell+1$ and have no odd hole of length at least $2\\\\ell+5$.\\nChudnovsky {\\\\em et al.} \\\\cite{CSS2016} proved that every graph in ${\\\\cal\\nA}_{2}$ is 58000-colorable, and every graph in ${\\\\cal B}_{\\\\ell}$ is\\n$(\\\\ell+1)4^{\\\\ell-1}$-colorable. Lan and liu \\\\cite{LL2023} showed that for\\n$\\\\ell\\\\geq3$, every graph in ${\\\\cal G}_{\\\\ell}$ is 4-colorable. It is not known\\nwhether there exists a small constant $c$ such that graphs of ${\\\\cal G}_2$ are\\n$c$-colorable. In this paper, we show that every graph in ${\\\\cal G}_2$ is\\n1456-colorable, and every graph in ${\\\\cal A}_{3}$ is 4-colorable. We also show\\nthat every 7-hole free graph in ${\\\\cal B}_{\\\\ell}$ is $(12\\\\ell+8)$-colorable.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:12:42Z\"}"}
