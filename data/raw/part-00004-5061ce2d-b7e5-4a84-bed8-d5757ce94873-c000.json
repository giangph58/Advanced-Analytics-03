{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04326v1\", \"title\": \"Design and Evaluation of an NDN-Based Network for Distributed Digital\\n  Twins\", \"summary\": \"Digital twins (DT) have received significant attention due to their numerous\\nbenefits, such as real-time data analytics and cost reduction in production. DT\\nserves as a fundamental component of many applications, encompassing smart\\nmanufacturing, intelligent vehicles, and smart cities. By using Machine\\nLearning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, DTs can efficiently\\nfacilitate decision-making and productivity by simulating the status and\\nchanges of a physical entity. To handle the massive amount of data brought by\\nDTs, it is challenging to achieve low response latency for data fetching over\\nexisting IP-based networks. IP-based networks use host addresses for end-to-end\\ncommunication, making data distribution between DTs inefficient. Thus, we\\npropose to use DTs in a distributed manner over Named Data Networking (NDN)\\nnetworks. NDN is data-centric where data is routed based on content names,\\ndynamically adjusting paths to optimize latency. Popular data is cached in\\nnetwork nodes, reducing data transmission and network congestion. Since data is\\nfetched by content names, users and mobile devices can move freely without IP\\naddress reassignment. By using in-network caching and adaptive routing, we\\nreckon NDN is an ideal fit for Future G Networks in the context of Digital\\nTwins. We compared DTs in edge scenarios with cloud scenarios over NDN and\\nIP-based networks to validate our insights. Extensive simulation results show\\nthat using DT in the edge reduces response latency by 10.2x. This position\\npaper represents an initial investigation into the gap in distributed DTs over\\nNDN, serving as an early-stage study.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T11:21:12Z\"}"}
