Here we\\nput forward a machine learning strategy to extract the spin Hamiltonian from\\ninelastic spectroscopy with scanning tunneling microscopy, and we demonstrate\\nthis methodology experimentally with an artificial nanoscale molecular magnet\\nbased on cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPC) molecules on NbSe$_2$. We show that this\\ntechnique allows to directly extract the Hamiltonian parameters of a quantum\\nmagnet from the differential conductance, including the substrate-induced\\nspatial variation of the different exchange couplings. Our methodology\\nleverages a machine learning algorithm trained on exact quantum many-body\\nsimulations with tensor networks of finite quantum magnets, leading to a\\nmethodology that can be used to predict the Hamiltonian of CoPC quantum magnets\\nof arbitrary size. Our results demonstrate how quantum many-body methods and\\nmachine learning enable learning a microscopic description of nanoscale quantum\\nmany-body systems with scanning tunneling spectroscopy.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T12:43:35Z\"}"}
