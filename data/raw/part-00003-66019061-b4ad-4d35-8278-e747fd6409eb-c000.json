This study introduces a novel mathematical model for open membranes\\nimmersed in Stokes flows, accounting for membrane elasticity, line tension at\\nthe open edge, and fluid-membrane interactions. The model is derived from an\\nenergy functional that incorporates Helfrich bending energy and a line energy\\nassociated with the open edge. By balancing dissipation in both the bulk fluid\\nand the membrane surface, following the maximal dissipation principle, we\\nderive the governing equations within an energy variational framework. Assuming\\naxisymmetry and employing a boundary integral reduction, we transform the 3D\\nproblem into an effectively 1D problem, for which we develop a finite\\nelement-based numerical method to solve the resulting moving boundary problem.\\nSeveral numerical examples are provided to validate the model and compare the\\nresults with existing studies.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:39:54Z\"}"}
