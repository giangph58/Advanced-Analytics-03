{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10380v1\", \"title\": \"Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence and pre-compactness\", \"summary\": \"To goal of the paper is to introduce a convergence \\\\`a la Gromov-Hausdorff\\nfor Lorentzian spaces, building on $\\\\epsilon$-nets consisting of causal\\ndiamonds and relying only on the time separation function. This yields a\\ngeometric notion of convergence, which can be applied to synthetic Lorentzian\\nspaces (Lorentzian pre-length spaces) or smooth spacetimes. Among the main\\nresults, we prove a Lorentzian counterpart of the celebrated Gromov's\\npre-compactness theorem for metric spaces, where controlled covers by balls are\\nreplaced by controlled covers by diamonds. This yields a geometric\\npre-compactness result for classes of globally hyperbolic spacetimes,\\nsatisfying a uniform doubling property on Cauchy hypersurfaces and a suitable\\ncontrol on the causality. The final part of the paper establishes several\\napplications: we show that Chru\\\\'sciel-Grant approximations are an instance of\\nthe Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence here introduced, we prove that\\ntimelike sectional curvature bounds are stable under such a convergence, we\\nintroduce timelike blow-up tangents and discuss connections with the main\\nconjecture of causal set theory.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG,gr-qc,math-ph,math.MG,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:25:36Z\"}"}
