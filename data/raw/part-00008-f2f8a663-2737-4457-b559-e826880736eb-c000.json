{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05428v1\", \"title\": \"Empowering Scientific Workflows with Federated Agents\", \"summary\": \"Agentic systems, in which diverse agents cooperate to tackle challenging\\nproblems, are exploding in popularity in the AI community. However, the agentic\\nframeworks used to build these systems have not previously enabled use with\\nresearch cyberinfrastructure. Here we introduce Academy, a modular and\\nextensible middleware designed to deploy autonomous agents across the federated\\nresearch ecosystem, including HPC systems, experimental facilities, and data\\nrepositories. To meet the demands of scientific computing, Academy supports\\nasynchronous execution, heterogeneous resources, high-throughput data flows,\\nand dynamic resource availability. It provides abstractions for expressing\\nstateful agents, managing inter-agent coordination, and integrating computation\\nwith experimental control. We present microbenchmark results that demonstrate\\nhigh performance and scalability in HPC environments. To demonstrate the\\nbreadth of applications that can be supported by agentic workflow designs, we\\nalso present case studies in materials discovery, decentralized learning, and\\ninformation extraction in which agents are deployed across diverse HPC systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MA\", \"categories\": \"cs.MA,cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T17:15:39Z\"}"}
