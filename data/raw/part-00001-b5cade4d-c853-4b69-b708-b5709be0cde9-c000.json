Existing datasets predominantly reflect limited or indoor-focused\\nchanges, failing to adequately represent extensive outdoor transformations. To\\nbridge this gap, we introduce the City that Never Settles (CNS) dataset, a\\nsimulation-based dataset created using the CARLA simulator, capturing major\\nstructural changes-such as building construction and demolition-across diverse\\nmaps and sequences. Additionally, we propose TCR_sym, a symmetric version of\\nthe original TCR metric, enabling consistent measurement of structural changes\\nirrespective of source-target ordering. Quantitative comparisons demonstrate\\nthat CNS encompasses more extensive transformations than current real-world\\nbenchmarks. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LiDAR-based PR methods on CNS\\nreveal substantial performance degradation, underscoring the need for robust\\nalgorithms capable of handling significant environmental changes. Our dataset\\nis available at https://github.com/Hyunho111/CNS_dataset.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T09:16:01Z\"}"}
