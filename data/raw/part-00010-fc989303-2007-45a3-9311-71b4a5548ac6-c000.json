To formulate our equations, we use a space-time-continuous\\nHegselmann-Krause equation, which we solve using a particle method. We use the\\ncombined candidate-voter model to demonstrate the possibility of discontinuous\\njumps in candidate behavior as parameters of the model are varied. We also\\nextend the analysis to a three candidate scenario. We observe that depending on\\nthe parameters, candidates do not always come or stay together at their\\ndynamically evolving position.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph,math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T14:50:16Z\"}"}
