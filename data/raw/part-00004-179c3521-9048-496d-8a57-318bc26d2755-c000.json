This requires some nontrivial customized uniform estimates and\\nrepresentation formulas, given that the datum is only in $L^1(\\\\Omega)$ and\\ntherefore the usual regularity theory cannot be leveraged to our benefit in\\nthis framework.\\n  The limit process uses a nonlocal operator, obtained as an affine\\ntransformation of a homogeneous kernel, which recovers, in the limit as\\n$s\\\\nearrow 1$, every classical operator in divergence form.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T08:31:51Z\"}"}
