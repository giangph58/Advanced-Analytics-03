With recent advances in large language models (LLMs), this\\napproach has shown growing potential in capturing individual differences and\\npredicting group behaviors. However, existing methods face alignment challenges\\nrelated to the environment, target users, interaction mechanisms, and\\nbehavioral patterns. To this end, we introduce SocioVerse, an LLM-agent-driven\\nworld model for social simulation. Our framework features four powerful\\nalignment components and a user pool of 10 million real individuals. To\\nvalidate its effectiveness, we conducted large-scale simulation experiments\\nacross three distinct domains: politics, news, and economics. Results\\ndemonstrate that SocioVerse can reflect large-scale population dynamics while\\nensuring diversity, credibility, and representativeness through standardized\\nprocedures and minimal manual adjustments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T12:12:52Z\"}"}
