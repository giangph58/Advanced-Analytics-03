However, the enterprise domain introduces unique challenges that\\nexisting LLM-based approaches for data engineering often overlook, such as\\nlarge table sizes, more complex tasks, and the need for internal knowledge. To\\nbridge these gaps, we identify key enterprise-specific challenges related to\\ndata, tasks, and background knowledge and conduct a comprehensive study of\\ntheir impact on recent LLMs for data engineering. Our analysis reveals that\\nLLMs face substantial limitations in real-world enterprise scenarios, resulting\\nin significant accuracy drops. Our findings contribute to a systematic\\nunderstanding of LLMs for enterprise data engineering to support their adoption\\nin industry.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DB\", \"categories\": \"cs.DB\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T07:57:05Z\"}"}
