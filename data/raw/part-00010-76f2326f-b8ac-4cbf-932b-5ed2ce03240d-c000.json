{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14889v1\", \"title\": \"Latent Bayesian Optimization via Autoregressive Normalizing Flows\", \"summary\": \"Bayesian Optimization (BO) has been recognized for its effectiveness in\\noptimizing expensive and complex objective functions. Recent advancements in\\nLatent Bayesian Optimization (LBO) have shown promise by integrating generative\\nmodels such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) to manage the complexity of\\nhigh-dimensional and structured data spaces. However, existing LBO approaches\\noften suffer from the value discrepancy problem, which arises from the\\nreconstruction gap between input and latent spaces. This value discrepancy\\nproblem propagates errors throughout the optimization process, leading to\\nsuboptimal outcomes. To address this issue, we propose a Normalizing Flow-based\\nBayesian Optimization (NF-BO), which utilizes normalizing flow as a generative\\nmodel to establish one-to-one encoding function from the input space to the\\nlatent space, along with its left-inverse decoding function, eliminating the\\nreconstruction gap. Specifically, we introduce SeqFlow, an autoregressive\\nnormalizing flow for sequence data. In addition, we develop a new candidate\\nsampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the exploration probability for each\\ntoken based on its importance. Through extensive experiments, our NF-BO method\\ndemonstrates superior performance in molecule generation tasks, significantly\\noutperforming both traditional and recent LBO approaches.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T06:36:09Z\"}"}
