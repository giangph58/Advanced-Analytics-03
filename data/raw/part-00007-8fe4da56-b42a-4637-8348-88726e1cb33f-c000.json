In this paper, we show that\\nthe KP equation can be used to describe the in-plane motion of compressible\\nelastic solids with dispersion. Furthermore, a modified KP equation with cubic\\nnonlinearity is obtained in the case of incompressible solids with dispersion.\\nThen, several solutions of these partial differential equations are discussed\\nand computed using a Fourier spectral method. In particular, both equations\\nadmit solitary wave solutions.\", \"main_category\": \"math-ph\", \"categories\": \"math-ph,math.MP,nlin.PS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T10:03:50Z\"}"}
