Human-in-the-Loop Understanding for Fast\\n  Traversability Estimation in Mobile Robotics\", \"summary\": \"The increasing use of robots in unstructured environments necessitates the\\ndevelopment of effective perception and navigation strategies to enable field\\nrobots to successfully perform their tasks. In particular, it is key for such\\nrobots to understand where in their environment they can and cannot travel -- a\\ntask known as traversability estimation. However, existing geometric approaches\\nto traversability estimation may fail to capture nuanced representations of\\ntraversability, whereas vision-based approaches typically either involve\\nmanually annotating a large number of images or require robot experience. In\\naddition, existing methods can struggle to address domain shifts as they\\ntypically do not learn during deployment. To this end, we propose a\\nhuman-in-the-loop (HiL) method for traversability estimation that prompts a\\nhuman for annotations as-needed. Our method uses a foundation model to enable\\nrapid learning on new annotations and to provide accurate predictions even when\\ntrained on a small number of quickly-provided HiL annotations. We extensively\\nvalidate our method in simulation and on real-world data, and demonstrate that\\nit can provide state-of-the-art traversability prediction performance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:46:51Z\"}"}
