While this resilience has been recognized for\\nover two decades, the residual squeezing typically becomes so small that\\ndetecting it requires millions of measurements. In this work, we show that\\nencoding classical data (bits or dits) into the \\\"degree of squeezing\\\" of a\\nsingle-mode squeezed \\\"noisy\\\" state enablesefficient transmission through\\nplasmonic nanowires. Remarkably, this approach allows the encoded information\\nto be recovered even at long propagation distances using only a few\\nmeasurements -- far outperforming both squeezed non-noisy states and\\namplitude-based encoding schemes.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T15:41:25Z\"}"}
