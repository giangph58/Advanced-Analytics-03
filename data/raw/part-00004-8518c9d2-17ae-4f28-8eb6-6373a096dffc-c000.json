The IFE trial function set is composed of two\\ncomponents: the standard homogeneous IFE space and additional enrichment IFE\\nfunctions. These enrichment functions are directly determined by the jump data,\\nwithout adding extra degrees of freedom to the system. Meanwhile, the\\nhomogeneous IFE space is isomorphic to the standard finite element space on the\\nsame mesh. This isomorphism remains stable regardless of interface location\\nrelative to the mesh, ensuring optimal $\\\\mathcal{O}(h^2)$ conditioning that is\\nindependent of the interface location and facilitates an immediate development\\nof a multigrid fast solver; namely the iteration numbers are independent of not\\nonly the mesh size but also the relative interface location. Theoretical\\nanalysis and extensive numerical experiments are carried out in the efforts to\\ndemonstrate these features.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T14:59:56Z\"}"}
