(2) For each\\n$n \\\\in \\\\omega$, is there a lower-finite lattice of cardinality $\\\\aleph_{n}$\\nwhose elements have at most $n+1$ lower covers? We show that both questions\\nhave positive answers under the axiom of constructibility, and hence\\nconsistently with $\\\\mathsf{ZFC}$. More specifically, we derive the positive\\nanswers from assuming that $\\\\square_\\\\kappa$ holds for enough $\\\\kappa$'s.\", \"main_category\": \"math.LO\", \"categories\": \"math.LO,math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T09:24:41Z\"}"}
