Removing the illumination effects and enhancing the quality of such\\nimages is crucial for many tasks, such as image segmentation and object\\ndetection. In this paper, we propose a variational method for low-light image\\nenhancement based on the Retinex decomposition into illumination, reflectance,\\nand noise components. A color correction pre-processing step is applied to the\\nlow-light image, which is then used as the observed input in the decomposition.\\nMoreover, our model integrates a novel nonlocal gradient-type fidelity term\\ndesigned to preserve structural details. Additionally, we propose an automatic\\ngamma correction module. Building on the proposed variational approach, we\\nextend the model by introducing its deep unfolding counterpart, in which the\\nproximal operators are replaced with learnable networks. We propose\\ncross-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in both the\\nnonlocal prior of the reflectance and the nonlocal gradient-based constraint.\\nExperimental results demonstrate that both methods compare favorably with\\nseveral recent and state-of-the-art techniques across different datasets. In\\nparticular, despite not relying on learning strategies, the variational model\\noutperforms most deep learning approaches both visually and in terms of quality\\nmetrics.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:48:26Z\"}"}
