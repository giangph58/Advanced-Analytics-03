In this paper, we introduce Zad, a system designed to enrich NVD\\nvulnerability descriptions by leveraging external resources. Zad consists of\\ntwo pipelines: one collects and filters supplementary data using two encoders\\nto build a detailed dataset, while the other fine-tunes a pre-trained model on\\nthis dataset to generate enriched descriptions. By addressing brevity and\\nimproving content quality, Zad produces more comprehensive and cohesive\\nvulnerability descriptions. We evaluate Zad using standard summarization\\nmetrics and human assessments, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing\\nvulnerability information.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:08:27Z\"}"}
