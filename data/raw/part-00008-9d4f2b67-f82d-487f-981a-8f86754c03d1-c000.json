It turns out that matings of certain Fuchsian groups\\nand polynomials are contained in this ambient character variety. This gives\\nrise to two different analogs of the Bers slice by fixing either the polynomial\\nor the Fuchsian group. The Bers-like slices are homeomorphic copies of\\nTeichm\\\\\\\"uller spaces or combinatorial copies of polynomial connectedness loci.\\nWe show that these slices are bounded in the character variety, thus proving\\nthe analog of a theorem of Bers. To produce compactifications of the Bers-like\\nslices, we initiate a study of degeneration of algebraic correspondences on\\ntrees of Riemann spheres, revealing a new degeneration phenomenon in conformal\\ndynamics. There is no available analog of Sullivan's 'no invariant line field'\\ntheorem in our context. Nevertheless, for the four times punctured sphere, we\\nshow that the compactifications of Teichm\\\\\\\"uller spaces are naturally\\nhomeomorphic.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS,math.CV,math.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:21:50Z\"}"}
