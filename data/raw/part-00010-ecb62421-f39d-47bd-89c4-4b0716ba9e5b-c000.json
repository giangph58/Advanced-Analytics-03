In these\\nsystems, two-point correlation functions are of the utmost importance for the\\ncharacterization of processes taking place close to the acoustic horizon. In\\nthe present paper, dedicated to him, we present a study of path integral\\nmethods that allow to determine two-point correlation functions by a\\nperturbative expansion, in a way that -- beyond its generality -- is especially\\nsuited to analyze these processes. Our results apply to non-relativistic\\nsuperfluids, realizable in terrestrial experiments, as well as to relativistic\\nsuperfluids, relevant for compact stellar objects.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T07:14:59Z\"}"}
