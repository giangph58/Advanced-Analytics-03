{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19469v1\", \"title\": \"Different scenarios of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in the\\n  interacting instanton liquid model via flavor symmetry breaking\", \"summary\": \"We investigate a type of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (D$\\\\chi$SB) for\\nvarious current quark masses using the interacting instanton liquid model. The\\ntype of D$\\\\chi$SB is classified based on the sign of the second derivative of\\nthe free energy density with respect to the quark condensate at the origin. We\\nperform numerical simulations of the interacting instanton liquid model with\\nthe flavor SU(2) symmetric and (2+1)-flavor quarks. We find that the curvature\\nis negative in the SU(2) case. This means the ordinary type of D$\\\\chi$SB. In\\ncontrast, in the (2+1)-flavor case, a positive curvature is observed when the\\nstrange quark mass is as small as those of the up and down quarks. This\\nsuggests that the anomaly-driven type of D$\\\\chi$SB can occur under the\\napproximate flavor SU(3) symmetry. As the strange quark mass increases, the\\ncurvature gradually decreases and becomes negative when the strange quark mass\\nis approximately three times larger than those of the light quarks. This\\ndifference can be understood in terms of the 't Hooft vertex which induces a\\nsix-quark interaction in the $N_f=3$ case and does a four-quark interaction in\\nthe $N_f=2$ case. Our results might indicate that the ratio between the strange\\nand light quark masses plays a crucial role in understanding the microscopic\\nrelationship between D$\\\\chi$SB and the anomaly effect.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T04:15:15Z\"}"}
