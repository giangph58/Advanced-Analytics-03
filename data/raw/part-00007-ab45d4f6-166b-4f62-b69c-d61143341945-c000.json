Consequently, researchers have turned to\\nsynthetic methods for training data augmentation. However, existing synthetic\\nstrategies (e.g., naive cut-and-paste or inpainting) overlook the underlying\\nphysical causes of defects, leading to inconsistent, low-fidelity anomalies\\nthat hamper model generalization to real-world complexities. In this thesis, we\\nintroduced a novel pipeline that generates synthetic anomalies through\\nMath-Physics model guidance, refines them via a Coarse-to-Fine approach and\\nemploys a bi-level optimization strategy with a Synthesis Quality\\nEstimator(SQE). By incorporating physical modeling of cracks, corrosion, and\\ndeformation, our method produces realistic defect masks, which are subsequently\\nenhanced in two phases. The first stage (npcF) enforces a PDE-based consistency\\nto achieve a globally coherent anomaly structure, while the second stage\\n(npcF++) further improves local fidelity using wavelet transforms and boundary\\nsynergy blocks. Additionally, we leverage SQE-driven weighting, ensuring that\\nhigh-quality synthetic samples receive greater emphasis during training. To\\nvalidate our approach, we conducted comprehensive experiments on three widely\\nadopted industrial anomaly detection benchmarks: MVTec AD, VisA, and BTAD.\\nAcross these datasets, the proposed pipeline achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)\\nresults in both image-AUROC and pixel-AUROC, confirming the effectiveness of\\nour MaPhC2F and BiSQAD.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T14:22:27Z\"}"}
