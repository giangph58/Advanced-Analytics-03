{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02269v1\", \"title\": \"Engineering Artificial Intelligence: Framework, Challenges, and Future\\n  Direction\", \"summary\": \"Over the past ten years, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and\\nmachine learning (ML) in engineering domains has gained significant popularity,\\nshowcasing their potential in data-driven contexts. However, the complexity and\\ndiversity of engineering problems often require the development of\\ndomain-specific AI approaches, which are frequently hindered by a lack of\\nsystematic methodologies, scalability, and robustness during the development\\nprocess. To address this gap, this paper introduces the \\\"ABCDE\\\" as the key\\nelements of Engineering AI and proposes a unified, systematic engineering AI\\necosystem framework, including eight essential layers, along with attributes,\\ngoals, and applications, to guide the development and deployment of AI\\nsolutions for specific engineering needs. Additionally, key challenges are\\nexamined, and nine future research directions are highlighted. By providing a\\ncomprehensive perspective, this paper aims to advance the strategic\\nimplementation of AI, fostering the development of next-generation engineering\\nAI solutions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T04:30:10Z\"}"}
