Drawing on the observation that, in a certain range\\nof reactive power, there exists a trade-off between current and modulation\\nmagnitude, we exploit this freedom and define a constrained optimization\\nproblem. We propose two approaches, one in the form of an activation-function\\nwhich drives the reactive power set-point towards safety, and an approach which\\nuses online feedback optimization to set the reactive power dynamically. Both\\nmethods compromise reactive power tracking accuracy for increased system\\nrobustness. Through a high fidelity simulation, we compare the benefits of the\\ntwo methods, highlighting their effectiveness in industrial applications.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:08:32Z\"}"}
