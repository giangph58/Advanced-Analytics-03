For instance, $G$ could\\ninvolve higher-order derivative terms with nonlinear coefficients. Traditional\\nIMEX-RK methods, which treat $\\\\mathbf{f}$ explicitly and $G\\\\mathbf{u}$\\nimplicitly, require solving nonlinear systems at each time step when $G$\\ndepends on $\\\\mathbf{u}$, leading to increased computational cost and\\ncomplexity. In contrast, the proposed semi-IMEX scheme treats $G$ explicitly\\nwhile keeping $\\\\mathbf{u}$ implicit, reducing the problem to solving only\\nlinear systems. This approach eliminates the need to compute Jacobians while\\npreserving the stability advantages of implicit methods. A family of semi-IMEX\\nRK schemes with varying orders of accuracy is introduced. Numerical simulations\\nfor various nonlinear equations, including nonlinear diffusion models, the\\nNavier-Stokes equations, and the Cahn-Hilliard equation, confirm the expected\\nconvergence rates and demonstrate that the proposed method allows for larger\\ntime step sizes without triggering stability issues.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T08:18:57Z\"}"}
