{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09922v1\", \"title\": \"Enhancement and Suppression of Active Particle Movement Due to Membrane\\n  Deformations\", \"summary\": \"Microswimmers and active colloids often move in confined systems, including\\nthose involving interfaces. Such interfaces, especially at the microscale, may\\ndeform in response to the stresses of the flow created by the active particle.\\nWe develop a theoretical framework to analyze the effect of a nearby membrane\\ndue to the motion of an active particle whose flow fields are generated by\\nforce-free singularities. We demonstrate our result on a particle represented\\nby a combination of a force dipole and a source dipole, while the membrane\\nresists deformation due to tension and bending rigidity. We find that the\\ndeformation either enhances or suppresses the motion of the active particle,\\ndepending on its orientation and the relative strengths between the fundamental\\nsingularities that describe its flow. Furthermore, the deformation can generate\\nmotion in new directions.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T06:32:20Z\"}"}
