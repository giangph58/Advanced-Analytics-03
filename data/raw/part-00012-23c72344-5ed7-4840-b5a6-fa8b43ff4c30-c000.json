While singularities associated with vector electromagnetic\\ngauge fields have been well-studied, those of higher-form tensor gauge fields,\\nlike the four-dimensional (4D) tensor monopoles predicted by string theory,\\nhave remained largely theoretical or limited to experimental demonstration in\\npure synthetic dimensions, thereby not allowing investigations of the\\nassociated boundary effects. Here, we present a 4D system with tensor monopoles\\nusing engineered acoustic metamaterials. Our momentum space combines three real\\nmomentum dimensions and a geometric parameter as the fourth. By varying this\\nfourth momentum, we experimentally reveal two distinct topological surface\\nstates in 3D subsystems: Fermi-arc surface states in a gapless subsystem and\\nDirac-cone surface states in a gapped subsystem. Our work introduces a novel\\nplatform for exploring new topological structures associated with tensor gauge\\nfield and topological phenomena in higher dimensions.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T13:51:50Z\"}"}
