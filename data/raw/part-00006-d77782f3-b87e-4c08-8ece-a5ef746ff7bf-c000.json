While existing studies propose encryption for MAVLink, most\\nremain theoretical or simulation-based. We implement MAVShield alongside\\nAES-CTR, ChaCha20, Speck-CTR, and Rabbit, and evaluate them on a real drone\\ntestbed. A comprehensive security analysis using statistical test suites (NIST\\nand Diehard) demonstrates strong resistance of the novel cipher to\\ncryptanalysis. Performance evaluation across key metrics including memory\\nusage, CPU load, and battery power consumption, demonstrates that MAVShield\\noutperforms existing algorithms and offers an efficient, real-world solution\\nfor securing MAVLink communications in UAVs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T10:53:17Z\"}"}
