{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24272v1\", \"title\": \"Learning Velocity and Acceleration: Self-Supervised Motion Consistency\\n  for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction\", \"summary\": \"Understanding human motion is crucial for accurate pedestrian trajectory\\nprediction. Conventional methods typically rely on supervised learning, where\\nground-truth labels are directly optimized against predicted trajectories. This\\namplifies the limitations caused by long-tailed data distributions, making it\\ndifficult for the model to capture abnormal behaviors. In this work, we propose\\na self-supervised pedestrian trajectory prediction framework that explicitly\\nmodels position, velocity, and acceleration. We leverage velocity and\\nacceleration information to enhance position prediction through feature\\ninjection and a self-supervised motion consistency mechanism. Our model\\nhierarchically injects velocity features into the position stream. Acceleration\\nfeatures are injected into the velocity stream. This enables the model to\\npredict position, velocity, and acceleration jointly. From the predicted\\nposition, we compute corresponding pseudo velocity and acceleration, allowing\\nthe model to learn from data-generated pseudo labels and thus achieve\\nself-supervised learning. We further design a motion consistency evaluation\\nstrategy grounded in physical principles; it selects the most reasonable\\npredicted motion trend by comparing it with historical dynamics and uses this\\ntrend to guide and constrain trajectory generation. We conduct experiments on\\nthe ETH-UCY and Stanford Drone datasets, demonstrating that our method achieves\\nstate-of-the-art performance on both datasets.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:17:45Z\"}"}
