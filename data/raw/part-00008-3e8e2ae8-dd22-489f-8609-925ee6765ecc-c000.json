The main challenge is that available tuning knobs exceed beam-optics\\nconstraints. Independently optimized injection and top-energy optics often\\nyield disconnected solutions, making interpolation impossible. To address this,\\nwe propose two new methods. The first is a midpoint-penalty scheme that ensures\\nramping path continuity by penalizing constraint violations at intermediate\\nstate. The second is a top-down approach that adapts high-energy optics to low\\nenergy, guided by an adaptive weighting scheme to balance injection and ramping\\nconstraints. The solutions meet all beam dynamics and hardware limits. The two\\nmethods offer a general strategy for ramping in systems where the solution\\nspace is under-constrained and the starting and target configurations are far\\napart.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.acc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.acc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:32:47Z\"}"}
