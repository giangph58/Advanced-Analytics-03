However, current studies are hindered by steep computational costs\\ndue to the high-dimensional property of HSI and dense sampling-based training\\nparadigm, constraining their rapid deployment. Our key observation is that,\\nduring training, not all samples within the same homogeneous area are\\nindispensable, whereas ingenious sampling can provide a powerful substitute for\\nreducing costs. Motivated by this, we propose an Asymmetrical Consensus State\\nSpace Model (ACMamba) to significantly reduce computational costs without\\ncompromising accuracy. Specifically, we design an asymmetrical anomaly\\ndetection paradigm that utilizes region-level instances as an efficient\\nalternative to dense pixel-level samples. In this paradigm, a low-cost\\nMamba-based module is introduced to discover global contextual attributes of\\nregions that are essential for HSI reconstruction. Additionally, we develop a\\nconsensus learning strategy from the optimization perspective to simultaneously\\nfacilitate background reconstruction and anomaly compression, further\\nalleviating the negative impact of anomaly reconstruction. Theoretical analysis\\nand extensive experiments across eight benchmarks verify the superiority of\\nACMamba, demonstrating a faster speed and stronger performance over the\\nstate-of-the-art.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T05:33:42Z\"}"}
