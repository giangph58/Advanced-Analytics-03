This work\\ncollects all tasks that arise in a control center for an automated vehicle\\nfleet from literature and assigns them to the two roles Remote Operator and\\nFleet Manager. Focusing on the driving-related tasks of the remote operator, a\\nprocess is derived that contains the sequence of tasks, associated vehicle\\nstates, and transitions between the states. The resulting state diagram shows\\nall remote operator actions available to effectively resolve automated vehicle\\ndisengagements. Thus, the state diagram can be applied to existing legislation\\nor modified based on prohibitions of specific interactions. The developed\\ncontrol center framework and included state diagram should serve as a basis for\\nimplementing and testing remote support for automated vehicles to be validated\\non public roads.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:01:04Z\"}"}
