{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17384v1\", \"title\": \"On the workflow, opportunities and challenges of developing foundation\\n  model in geophysics\", \"summary\": \"Foundation models, as a mainstream technology in artificial intelligence,\\nhave demonstrated immense potential across various domains in recent years,\\nparticularly in handling complex tasks and multimodal data. In the field of\\ngeophysics, although the application of foundation models is gradually\\nexpanding, there is currently a lack of comprehensive reviews discussing the\\nfull workflow of integrating foundation models with geophysical data. To\\naddress this gap, this paper presents a complete framework that systematically\\nexplores the entire process of developing foundation models in conjunction with\\ngeophysical data. From data collection and preprocessing to model architecture\\nselection, pre-training strategies, and model deployment, we provide a detailed\\nanalysis of the key techniques and methodologies at each stage. In particular,\\nconsidering the diversity, complexity, and physical consistency constraints of\\ngeophysical data, we discuss targeted solutions to address these challenges.\\nFurthermore, we discuss how to leverage the transfer learning capabilities of\\nfoundation models to reduce reliance on labeled data, enhance computational\\nefficiency, and incorporate physical constraints into model training, thereby\\nimproving physical consistency and interpretability. Through a comprehensive\\nsummary and analysis of the current technological landscape, this paper not\\nonly fills the gap in the geophysics domain regarding a full-process review of\\nfoundation models but also offers valuable practical guidance for their\\napplication in geophysical data analysis, driving innovation and advancement in\\nthe field.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.geo-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.geo-ph,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T09:08:24Z\"}"}
