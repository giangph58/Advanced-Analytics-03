{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11032v1\", \"title\": \"On Rigid Varieties Isogenous to a Product of Curves\", \"summary\": \"In this note, we study rigid complex manifolds that are realized as quotients\\nof a product of curves by a free action of a finite group. They serve as\\nhigher-dimensional analogues of Beauville surfaces. Using uniformization, we\\noutline the theory to characterize these manifolds through specific\\ncombinatorial data associated with the group under the assumption that the\\naction is diagonal and the manifold is of general type. This leads to the\\nnotion of a $n$-fold Beauville structure. We define an action on the set of all\\n$n$-fold Beauville structures of a given finite group that allows us to\\ndistinguish the biholomorphism classes of the underlying rigid manifolds. As an\\napplication, we give a classification of these manifolds with group $\\\\mathbb\\nZ_5^2$ in the three dimensional case and prove that this is the smallest\\npossible group that allows a rigid, free and diagonal action on a product of\\nthree curves. In addition, we provide the classification of rigid 3-folds $X$\\ngiven by a group acting faithfully on each factor for any value of the\\nholomorphic Euler number $\\\\chi(\\\\mathcal O_X) \\\\geq -5$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG,math.CV,math.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T09:54:58Z\"}"}
