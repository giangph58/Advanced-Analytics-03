In this work,\\nwe perform self-consistent RPA calculations by optimizing the local KS\\npotential through the optimized effective potential equation. We study a number\\nof solids (C, Si, BN, LiF, MgO, TiO$_2$), and find in all cases a lowering of\\nthe total energy with respect to non-self-consistent RPA. We then propose a\\nvariational approach to optimize PBE0-type hybrid functionals based on the\\nminimization of the RPA total energy with respect to the fraction of exact\\nexchange used to generate the input KS orbitals. We show that this scheme leads\\nto hybrid functionals with a KS band structure in close agreement with RPA, and\\nwith lattice constants of similar accuracy as within RPA. Finally, we evaluate\\n$G_0W_0$ gaps using RPA and hybrid KS potentials as starting points. Special\\nattention is given to TiO$_2$, which exhibits a strong starting-point\\ndependence.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T09:08:09Z\"}"}
