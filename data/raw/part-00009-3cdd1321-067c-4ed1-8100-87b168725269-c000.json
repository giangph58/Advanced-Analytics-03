{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03405v1\", \"title\": \"Who Flees Conflict?\", \"summary\": \"Despite the growing numbers of forcibly displaced persons worldwide, many\\npeople living under conflict choose not to flee. Individuals face two lotteries\\n- staying or leaving - characterized by two distributions of potential\\noutcomes. This paper proposes to model the choice between these two lotteries\\nusing quantile maximization as opposed to expected utility theory. The paper\\nposits that risk-averse individuals aim at minimizing losses by choosing the\\nlottery with the best outcome at the lower end of the distribution, whereas\\nrisk-tolerant individuals aim at maximizing gains by choosing the lottery with\\nthe best outcome at the higher end of the distribution. Using a rich set of\\nhousehold and conflict panel data from Nigeria, the paper finds that\\nrisk-tolerant individuals have a significant preference for staying and\\nrisk-averse individuals have a significant preference for fleeing, in line with\\nthe predictions of the quantile maximization model. These findings are in\\ncontrast to findings on economic migrants, and call for separate policies\\ntoward economic and forced migrants.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T10:31:31Z\"}"}
