{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04459v1\", \"title\": \"Numerical modeling for trapped-ion thermometry using dark resonances\", \"summary\": \"The accurate simulation of vibrational energy transport and quantum\\nthermodynamics with trapped ions requires good methods for the estimation of\\ntemperatures. One valuable tool with this purpose is based on the fit of dark\\nresonances in the fluorescence spectrum. However, the reliability of the\\nprocedure is still unclear. Here, we discuss several techniques with simplified\\ndynamical equations for the numerical simulation of the spectrum of a trapped\\nion undergoing thermal motion, identifying advantages and limitations of each\\nmethod. We start with a simplified three-level model to provide a better\\ninsight into the approximations involved and then move on to tackle the\\nexperimentally relevant case of an eight-level calcium ion. We observe that\\nmimicking the effect of thermal motion by means of additional dephasing is\\ncomputationally very convenient but can lead to significant errors in the\\nestimation of the temperature. However, this can be counteracted by a proper\\ncalibration, supporting the use of dark resonances as a practical thermometer.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:28:50Z\"}"}
