I\\n  : Model and Symmetries\", \"summary\": \"This article deals with the existence and scaling of an energy cascade in\\nsteady granular liquid flows between the scale at which the system is forced\\nand the scale at which it dissipates energy. In particular, we examine the\\npossible origins of a breaking of the Kolmogorov Universality class that\\napplies to Newtonian liquids under similar conditions. In order to answer these\\nquestions, we build a generic field theory of granular liquid flows and,\\nthrough a study of its symmetries, show that indeed the Kolmogorov scaling can\\nbe broken, although most of the symmetries of the Newtonian flows are\\npreserved.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,cond-mat.stat-mech,physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T15:18:48Z\"}"}
