{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12897v1\", \"title\": \"OntoPortal-Astro, a Semantic Artefact Catalogue for Astronomy\", \"summary\": \"The astronomy communities are widely recognised as mature communities for\\ntheir open science practices. However, while their data ecosystems are rather\\nadvanced and permit efficient data interoperability, there are still gaps\\nbetween these ecosystems. Semantic artefacts (e.g., ontologies, thesauri,\\nvocabularies or metadata schemas) are a means to bridge that gap as they allow\\nto semantically described the data and map the underlying concepts. The\\nincreasing use of semantic artefacts in astronomy presents challenges in\\ndescription, selection, evaluation, trust, and mappings. The landscape remains\\nfragmented, with semantic artefacts scattered across various registries in\\ndiverse formats and structures -- not yet fully developed or encoded with rich\\nsemantic web standards like OWL or SKOS -- and often with overlapping scopes.\\nEnhancing data semantic interoperability requires common platforms to catalog,\\nalign, and facilitate the sharing of FAIR semantic artefacts. In the frame of\\nthe FAIR-IMPACT project, we prototyped a semantic artefact catalogue for\\nastronomy, heliophysics and planetary sciences. This exercise resulted in\\nimproved vocabulary and ontology management in the communities, and is now\\npaving the way for better interdisciplinary data discovery and reuse. This\\narticle presents current practices in our discipline, reviews candidate SAs for\\nsuch a catalogue, presents driving use cases and the perspective of a real\\nproduction service for the astronomy community based on the OntoPortal\\ntechnology, that will be called OntoPortal-Astro.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM,cs.DL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T12:38:38Z\"}"}
