We use an\\nabsorption-monitoring technique to measure <Fz>, i.e., the expectation values\\nof the quantization (z) axis components of the total angular momentum of cesium\\n(Cs) atoms in the electronic ground state in both uncoated and\\nanti-relaxation-coated vacuum cells at room temperature. Cs atoms are polarized\\nvia optical pumping and probed using their D2 transitions. The probe laser\\nfrequency is varied across the Doppler-broadened D2 transition; the <Fz> values\\nare derived using the integrated absorption coefficients. The largest <Fz> is\\n2.5 for the coated cell. We then use a simple model of spin flow through vapor\\ncells to estimate the atomic spin relaxation probabilities after a single\\nsurface collision.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T12:06:56Z\"}"}
