In this paper, by using an effective model to\\ndescribe the surface states, we analyze the Landau bands and then calculate the\\nmagnetoconductivities and magnetoresistivities. From these results, the\\nfeatures of two-dimensional quantum Hall effect of the surface states can be\\ncaptured. More importantly, we reveal that the activation energy is determined\\nby the Hall plateau width, which can explain the experimental observations that\\nthe activation energies at odd plateaus are larger than those at even plateaus.\\nWe also analyze the roles played by the structural inversion symmetry breaking\\nand impurity scatterings in the magnetotransport, and suggest that their\\ncombined effects would lead to the absence of some Hall plateaus.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T11:40:31Z\"}"}
