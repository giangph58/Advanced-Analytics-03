This anisotropic distribution\\nfunction has an angular asymmetry controlled by the parameter of anisotropy\\n$\\\\xi$, such that in the limit of a vanishing anisotropy $\\\\lim_{\\\\xi \\\\rightarrow\\n0} \\\\hat{f}_{0 \\\\mathbf{k}} = f_{0 \\\\mathbf{k}}$, approaches the spherically\\nsymmetric local equilibrium distribution function. The corresponding moments of\\nthe binary collision integral are obtained in terms of quadratic products of\\ndifferent moments of the anisotropic distribution function and couple to a well\\ndefined set of lower-order moments. To illustrate these results we compare the\\nmoments of the binary collision integral to the moments of the widely used\\nrelaxation-time approximation of Anderson and Witting in case of a spheroidal\\ndistribution function. We found that in an expanding system the nonlinear\\nBoltzmann collision term leads to twice slower equilibration than the\\nrelaxation-time approximation. Furthermore we also show that including two\\ndynamical moments helps to resolve the ambiguity which additional moment of the\\nBoltzmann equation to choose to close the conservation laws.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,hep-ph,physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T10:25:14Z\"}"}
