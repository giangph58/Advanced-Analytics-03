{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23980v1\", \"title\": \"SALT: A Flexible Semi-Automatic Labeling Tool for General LiDAR Point\\n  Clouds with Cross-Scene Adaptability and 4D Consistency\", \"summary\": \"We propose a flexible Semi-Automatic Labeling Tool (SALT) for general LiDAR\\npoint clouds with cross-scene adaptability and 4D consistency. Unlike recent\\napproaches that rely on camera distillation, SALT operates directly on raw\\nLiDAR data, automatically generating pre-segmentation results. To achieve this,\\nwe propose a novel zero-shot learning paradigm, termed data alignment, which\\ntransforms LiDAR data into pseudo-images by aligning with the training\\ndistribution of vision foundation models. Additionally, we design a\\n4D-consistent prompting strategy and 4D non-maximum suppression module to\\nenhance SAM2, ensuring high-quality, temporally consistent presegmentation.\\nSALT surpasses the latest zero-shot methods by 18.4% PQ on SemanticKITTI and\\nachieves nearly 40-50% of human annotator performance on our newly collected\\nlow-resolution LiDAR data and on combined data from three LiDAR types,\\nsignificantly boosting annotation efficiency. We anticipate that SALT's\\nopen-sourcing will catalyze substantial expansion of current LiDAR datasets and\\nlay the groundwork for the future development of LiDAR foundation models.
