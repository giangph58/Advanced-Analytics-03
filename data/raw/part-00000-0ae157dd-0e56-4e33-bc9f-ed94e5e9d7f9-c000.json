We identify a relationship between bound\\nentanglement and Markov gap, which is introduced in holography from the\\nentanglement wedge cross-section, and is related to the fidelity of Markov\\nrecovery problem. We prove that the bound entanglement must have non-zero\\nMarkov gap, and conversely, the state with weakly non-zero Markov gap almost\\nsurely, with respect to Haar measure, has an entanglement undistillable, i.e.\\nbound entangled or separable, marginal state for sufficiently large system.\\nMoreover, we show that the bound entanglement and the threshold for\\nseparability in Haar random state is originated from the state with weakly\\nnon-zero Markov gap, which supports the non-perturbative effects from\\nholographic perspective. Our results shed light on the investigation of Markov\\ngap, and enhance the interdisciplinary application of quantum information.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T07:54:04Z\"}"}
