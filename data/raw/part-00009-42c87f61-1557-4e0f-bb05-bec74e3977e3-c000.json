Within the framework of an accurate few-body\\ncalculation method (GEM), we employ the chiral quark model to simultaneously\\nconsider the molecular and diquark structures of these two multiquark systems\\nand include their channel coupling effects. Our results show that the \\\\(K\\n\\\\bar{K}_1\\\\) system remains a scattering state. On the other hand, due to the\\npresence of a good-diquark structure in the \\\\(K K_1\\\\) system, we obtain a bound\\nstate in the coupled-channel calculation. The primary contribution to the\\nbinding energy comes from the exchange of \\\\(\\\\pi\\\\)-meson and \\\\(\\\\sigma\\\\)-meson.\\nThe inter-quark distance indicates that it is a compact four-quark structure.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T07:10:02Z\"}"}
