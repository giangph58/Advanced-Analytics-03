Our approach leverages\\nchain-of-thought prompting to generate detailed reasoning logs, which are\\nsubsequently distilled into structured, human-understandable logical rules. The\\npipeline integrates multiple enhancements - efficient data ingestion, a\\ntwo-step refinement process, ensemble candidate sampling, simulated\\nreinforcement learning scoring, and persistent memory - to ensure both stable\\ndecision-making and transparent output. Experimental evaluations on curated\\nstartup datasets demonstrate that our combined pipeline improves precision by\\n54% from 0.225 to 0.346 and accuracy by 50% from 0.46 to 0.70 compared to a\\nstandalone OpenAI o3 model. Notably, our model achieves over 2x the precision\\nof a random classifier (16%). By combining state-of-the-art AI reasoning with\\nexplicit rule-based explanations, our method not only augments traditional\\ndecision-making processes but also facilitates expert intervention and\\ncontinuous policy refinement. This work lays the foundation for the\\nimplementation of interpretable LLM-powered decision frameworks in high-stakes\\ninvestment environments and other domains that require transparent and\\ndata-driven insights.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,I.2.7\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T13:53:42Z\"}"}
