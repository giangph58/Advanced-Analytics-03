{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20656v1\", \"title\": \"Federated learning, ethics, and the double black box problem in medical\\n  AI\", \"summary\": \"Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning approach that allows multiple\\ndevices or institutions to collaboratively train a model without sharing their\\nlocal data with a third-party. FL is considered a promising way to address\\npatient privacy concerns in medical artificial intelligence. The ethical risks\\nof medical FL systems themselves, however, have thus far been underexamined.\\nThis paper aims to address this gap. We argue that medical FL presents a new\\nvariety of opacity -- federation opacity -- that, in turn, generates a\\ndistinctive double black box problem in healthcare AI. We highlight several\\ninstances in which the anticipated benefits of medical FL may be exaggerated,\\nand conclude by highlighting key challenges that must be overcome to make FL\\nethically feasible in medicine.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.CY,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T11:31:48Z\"}"}
