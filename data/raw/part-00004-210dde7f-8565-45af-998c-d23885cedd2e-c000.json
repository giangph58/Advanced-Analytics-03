When there is no magnetic diffusion, even small data global\\nwell-posedness is unknown. This study investigates the Cauchy problem in\\n$\\\\mathbb{R}^3$ for the compressible viscous MHD equations with horizontal\\nmagnetic diffusion. Using various anisotropic Sobolev inequalities and sharp\\nestimates, we establish the existence of global solutions under small initial\\ndata within the Sobolev space framework.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T11:59:44Z\"}"}
