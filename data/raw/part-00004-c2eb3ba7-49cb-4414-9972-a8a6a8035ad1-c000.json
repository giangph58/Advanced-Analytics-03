{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21487v1\", \"title\": \"DGSolver: Diffusion Generalist Solver with Universal Posterior Sampling\\n  for Image Restoration\", \"summary\": \"Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in universal image\\nrestoration. While existing methods speed up inference by reducing sampling\\nsteps, substantial step intervals often introduce cumulative errors. Moreover,\\nthey struggle to balance the commonality of degradation representations and\\nrestoration quality. To address these challenges, we introduce\\n\\\\textbf{DGSolver}, a diffusion generalist solver with universal posterior\\nsampling. We first derive the exact ordinary differential equations for\\ngeneralist diffusion models and tailor high-order solvers with a queue-based\\naccelerated sampling strategy to improve both accuracy and efficiency. We then\\nintegrate universal posterior sampling to better approximate\\nmanifold-constrained gradients, yielding a more accurate noise estimation and\\ncorrecting errors in inverse inference. Extensive experiments show that\\nDGSolver outperforms state-of-the-art methods in restoration accuracy,\\nstability, and scalability, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Code and\\nmodels will be available at https://github.com/MiliLab/DGSolver.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T10:12:48Z\"}"}
