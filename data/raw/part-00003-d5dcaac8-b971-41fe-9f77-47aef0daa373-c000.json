These metrics help uncover\\npatterns in attention allocation and diagnostic strategies. Furthermore, we\\ninvestigate whether and how doctors' gaze behavior shifts when viewing\\nauthentic (Real) versus deep-learning-generated (Fake) images. To achieve this,\\nwe examine fixation bias maps, focusing on first, last, short, and longest\\nfixations independently, along with detailed saccades patterns, to quantify\\ndifferences in gaze distribution and visual saliency between authentic and\\nsynthetic images.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T10:13:59Z\"}"}
