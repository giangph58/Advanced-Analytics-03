{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10942v1\", \"title\": \"The path towards measuring the gravitational field of proton bunches at\\n  accelerators\", \"summary\": \"The Newtonian law describing the gravitational interaction of\\nnon-relativistic (slowly moving) gravitating matter, has been tested in many\\nlaboratory experiments with very high precision. In contrast, the post\\nMinkowskian predictions for the gravitational field of ultra-relativistic\\nmatter, dominated by momentum instead of rest mass, have not been tested\\ndirectly yet. The intense ultra-relativistic proton beam in the LHC storage\\nring offers the potential to test general relativity and alternative\\ngravitational theories in this parameter regime for the first time in\\ncontrolled lab-scale experiments. If successful, this would open the road to a\\nnovel use case of the LHC, where non-trivial gravitational physics could be\\nstudied likely in a parasitic mode, without the necessity of dedicated filling\\npatterns. While the technical challenges are formidable, they should also lead\\nto the development of ultra-high-sensitive acceleration sensors with abundant\\napplications in other parts of science and technology. The present document\\nsummarizes the status of the theoretical studies in this direction, points out\\nthe challenges, and possible ways of addressing them. It was submitted as a\\ncontribution to the European Strategy for Particle Physics (ESPP) 2026 Update.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex,gr-qc,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T07:45:35Z\"}"}
