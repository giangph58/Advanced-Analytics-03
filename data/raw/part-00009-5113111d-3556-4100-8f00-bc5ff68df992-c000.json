Moreover, the randomness and variability of moir\\\\'e\\npattern generation pose challenges to the robustness of existing methods when\\napplied to real-world data. To address these issues, this paper presents SIDME\\n(Self-supervised Image Demoir\\\\'eing via Masked Encoder-Decoder Reconstruction),\\na novel model designed to generate high-quality visual images by effectively\\nprocessing moir\\\\'e patterns. SIDME combines a masked encoder-decoder\\narchitecture with self-supervised learning, allowing the model to reconstruct\\nimages using the inherent properties of camera sampling frequencies. A key\\ninnovation is the random masked image reconstructor, which utilizes an\\nencoder-decoder structure to handle the reconstruction task. Furthermore, since\\nthe green channel in camera sampling has a higher sampling frequency compared\\nto red and blue channels, a specialized self-supervised loss function is\\ndesigned to improve the training efficiency and effectiveness. To ensure the\\ngeneralization ability of the model, a self-supervised moir\\\\'e image generation\\nmethod has been developed to produce a dataset that closely mimics real-world\\nconditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIDME outperforms existing\\nmethods in processing real moir\\\\'e pattern data, showing its superior\\ngeneralization performance and robustness.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,eess.IV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T16:50:41Z\"}"}
