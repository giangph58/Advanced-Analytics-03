The\\n12.5 kHz VLF discharge under various RF powers (13.56 MHz) was analyzed using\\noptical photography and current-voltage measurements. Two-dimensional electron\\ndensities were derived using optical emission spectroscopy combined with\\ncollisional radiation modeling methods. It is found that RF power and very low\\nfrequency voltage (VVLF) significantly influence the plasma and its discharge\\nmodes within the 200 {\\\\mu}m pore. Under low VVLF conditions, the plasma is more\\nintense within the pore, and the discharge mode is columnar discharge. With\\nincreasing RF power, the reciprocal motion of electrons counteracts the local\\nenhancement effect of columnar discharge, the discharge transforms into RF\\ndischarge, the pore is completely wrapped by the sheath, and the plasma inside\\nis gradually quenched. Under high VVLF conditions, the electron density within\\nthe pore is low and the discharge mode is filamentary discharge. RF\\nintroduction reduces plasma intensity within the pores firstly. As RF power\\nincreases, more ion trapping in the pore increases the field strength\\ndistortion and enhances the plasma intensity inside the pore, this enhancement\\neffects becomes more obvious with increasing RF power. In addition, the above\\neffects were observed for all pore widths from 100 um to 1000 um. These\\nfindings provide key insights for controlling plasma in pores and offer new\\nmethodologies for plasma technology applications.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T03:43:11Z\"}"}
