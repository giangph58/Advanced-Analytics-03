{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03718v1\", \"title\": \"Nematic ordering via vertical stratification in drying clay nanotube\\n  suspensions\", \"summary\": \"Evaporative self-assembly offers a simple, cost-effective method for\\nproducing functional nanostructured materials. However, achieving tunable and\\nordered assemblies remains challenging, especially when working with complex\\nbuilding blocks like nanoparticles that exhibit significant shape and size\\npolydispersity. In this study, starting from an aqueous suspension of a\\npolydisperse sample of rod-like Halloysite nanotubes, we present a physical\\nprotocol for producing a high degree of orientational ordering in the final\\ndried deposit. By placing a sessile droplet on a substrate heated to 50{\\\\deg}C,\\nself-induced Marangoni flows suppress the coffee-ring effect, enabling more\\nuniform deposition of colloidal rods. Subsequently, the vertical stratification\\nduring evaporation leads to the segregation of particles by aspect ratio, with\\nlonger rods (aspect ratio>=6.5) preferentially migrating to the top layers over\\nthe entire deposit. Since rods exceeding this threshold exhibit nematic\\nordering at high densities, the resulting top layer, spanning an area of the\\norder of mm^2, displays a high degree of orientational order. Thus, our results\\nhighlight a robust strategy for engineering ordered structures from disordered\\ncolloidal suspensions despite the overall polydispersity of the system.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T17:45:24Z\"}"}
