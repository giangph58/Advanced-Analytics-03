{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00419v1\", \"title\": \"Self-supervised surface-related multiple suppression with\\n  multidimensional convolution\", \"summary\": \"Surface-related multiples pose significant challenges in seismic data\\nprocessing, often obscuring primary reflections and reducing imaging quality.\\nTraditional methods rely on computationally expensive algorithms, the prior\\nknowledge of subsurface model, or accurate wavelet estimation, while supervised\\nlearning approaches require clean labels, which are impractical for real data.\\nThus, we propose a self-supervised learning framework for surface-related\\nmultiple suppression, leveraging multi-dimensional convolution to generate\\nmultiples from the observed data and a two-stage training strategy comprising a\\nwarm-up and an iterative data refinement stage, so the network learns to remove\\nthe multiples. The framework eliminates the need for labeled data by\\niteratively refining predictions using multiples augmented inputs and\\npseudo-labels. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method\\neffectively suppresses surface-related multiples while preserving primary\\nreflections. Migration results confirm its ability to reduce artifacts and\\nimprove imaging quality.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.geo-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.geo-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T09:33:15Z\"}"}
