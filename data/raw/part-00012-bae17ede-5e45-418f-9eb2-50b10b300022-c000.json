This paper explores the fundamental\\nproperties of these monogenic functions, focusing on the Cauchy-Pompeiu\\nintegral formula and Taylor series expansion in hypercomplex subspaces, among\\nwhich the non-commutativity and especially non-associativity of multiplications\\ndemand full considerations. The theory presented herein provides a robust\\nframework for understanding monogenic functions in the context of real\\nalternative $\\\\ast$-algebras, shedding light on the interplay between algebraic\\nstructures and hypercomplex analysis.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CV\", \"categories\": \"math.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T05:04:50Z\"}"}
