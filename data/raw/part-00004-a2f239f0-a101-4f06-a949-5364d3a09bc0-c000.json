Building on the approach of Wolfram (2025), the fitness of a\\ncellular automaton is determined by the number of updates it endures before\\nreturning to an empty configuration. In our population-based model, groups of\\nautomata are assessed either by summing individual fitness or by the maximum\\nfitness in the group; this second scheme mimics cooperation by allowing fit\\nrules to support their less fit group mates. We show that cooperation\\nsubstantially improves the population's ability to evolve longer-lived rules,\\nillustrating a Baldwin Effect for Cooperation: higher diversity across\\nindividuals unlock otherwise inaccessible evolutionary paths.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.PE\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.PE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:01:42Z\"}"}
