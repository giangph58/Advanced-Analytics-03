Method\\n  and Candidates\", \"summary\": \"Quasar pair, a special subclass of galaxy pair, is valuable in the\\ninvestigation of quasar interaction, co-evolution, merger, and clustering, as\\nwell as the formation and evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes.\\nHowever, quasar pairs at kpc-scale are rare in the universe. The scarcity of\\navailable samples hindered the deeper exploration and statistics of these\\nobjects. In this work, we apply an astrometric method to systematically search\\nfor quasar candidates within a transverse distance of 100 kpc to known quasars\\nin the Million Quasar Catalog. These candidates are ${\\\\it Gaia}$ sources with\\nzero proper motion and zero parallax, which are the kinematic characteristics\\nof extragalactic sources. Visual inspection of the sample was performed to\\nremove the contamination of dense stellar fields and nearby galaxies. A total\\nof 4,062 quasar pair candidates were isolated, with the median member\\nseparation, ${\\\\it Gaia}$ G-band magnitude, and redshift of\\n8.81$^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}$, 20.49, and 1.59, respectively. Our catalog was compared\\nwith three major candidate quasar pair catalogs and identified 3,964 new quasar\\npair candidates previously uncataloged in the three catalogs. Extensive\\nspectroscopic follow-up campaigns are being carried out to validate their\\nastrophysical nature. Several interesting quasar pair candidates are\\nhighlighted and discussed. We also briefly discussed several techniques for\\nimproving the success rate of quasar pair selection.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T17:53:16Z\"}"}
