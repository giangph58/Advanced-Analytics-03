{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04925v1\", \"title\": \"Efficient construction of effective Hamiltonians with a hybrid machine\\n  learning method\", \"summary\": \"The effective Hamiltonian method is a powerful tool for simulating\\nlarge-scale systems across a wide range of temperatures. However, previous\\nmethods for constructing effective Hamiltonian models suffer from key\\nlimitations: some require to manually predefine interaction terms limited\\nflexibility in capturing complex systems, while others lack efficiency in\\nselecting optimal interactions. In this work, we introduce the Lasso-GA Hybrid\\nMethod (LGHM), a novel approach that combines Lasso regression and genetic\\nalgorithms to rapidly construct effective Hamiltonian models. Such method is\\nbroadly applicable to both magnetic systems (e.g., spin Hamiltonians) and\\natomic displacement models. To verify the reliability and usefulness of LGHM,\\nwe take monolayer CrI_3 and Fe_3 GaTe_2 as examples. In both cases, LGHM not\\nonly successfully identifies key interaction terms with high fitting accuracy,\\nbut also reproduces experimental magnetic ground states and Curie temperatures\\nwith further Monte Carlo simulations. Notable, our analysis of monolayer Fe_3\\nGaTe_2 reveals that the single-ion anisotropy and Heisenberg interaction lead\\nto an out-of-plane ferromagnetic ground state, while the fourth-order\\ninteractions contribute significantly to the high Curie temperature. Our method\\nis general so it can be applied to construct other effective Hamiltonian\\nmodels.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.comp-ph,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T03:47:47Z\"}"}
