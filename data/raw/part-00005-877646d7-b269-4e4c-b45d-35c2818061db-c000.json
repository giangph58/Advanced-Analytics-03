{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12980v1\", \"title\": \"Motion of ferrodark solitons in harmonically trapped superfluids: spin\\n  corrections and emergent quartic potentials exhibiting symmetry breaking\", \"summary\": \"We propose a framework for topological soliton dynamics in trapped spinor\\nsuperfluids, decomposing the force acting on the soliton by the surrounding\\nfluid into the buoyancy force and spin-corrections arising from the density\\ndepletion at soliton core and the coupling between the orbital motion and the\\nspin mixing, respectively. For ferrodark solitons (FDSs) in spin-1\\nBose-Einstein Condensates (BECs), the spin correction enables mapping the FDS\\nmotion in a harmonic trap to the atomic-mass particle dynamics in an emergent\\nquartic potential. Initially placing a type-I FDS near the trap center, a\\nsingle-sided oscillation happens, which maps to the particle moving around a\\nlocal minimum of the emergent double-well potential. As the initial distance of\\na type-II FDS from the trap center increases, the motion exhibits three\\nregimes: trap-centered harmonic and anharmonic, followed by single-sided\\noscillations. Correspondingly the emergent quartic potential undergoes symmetry\\nbreaking, transitioning from a single minimum to a double-well shape, where\\nparticle motion shifts from oscillating around the single minimum to crossing\\nbetween two minima via the local maximum, then the motion around one of the two\\nminima. In a hard-wall trap with linear potential, the FDS motion maps to a\\nharmonic oscillator.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas,nlin.PS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T14:32:16Z\"}"}
