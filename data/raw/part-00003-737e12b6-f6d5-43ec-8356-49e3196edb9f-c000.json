They are\\nlocal analogs of special cycles on GSpin Shimura varieties with almost\\nself-dual parahoric level (e.g. Siegel threefolds with paramodular level). We\\nestablish local arithmetic Siegel--Weil formulas relating arithmetic\\nintersection numbers of these special cycles and derivatives of certain local\\nWhittaker functions in any dimension. The proof is based on a reduction formula\\nfor cyclic quadratic lattices.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:06:52Z\"}"}
