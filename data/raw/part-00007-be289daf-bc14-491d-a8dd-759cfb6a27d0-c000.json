Despite the\\nadvances in research, a fundamental understanding of multipole moments,\\nparticularly octupole moments, remains limited due to the challenges of\\naccurately treating the position operator in bulk crystals, which is integral\\nto their definitions. In this paper, we overcome this problem by using a\\nthermodynamic relation and derive a formula of the spin magnetic octupole\\nmoment (SMOM) that can be used in bulk crystals. The resulting formula is gauge\\ninvariant and satisfies St\\\\v{r}eda formulas, which relate the SMOM to the spin\\nmagnetoelectric dipole-quadrupole susceptibilities. Furthermore, we apply this\\nformula to several models and examine the fundamental properties of the SMOM.\\nOne particularly important property is that the SMOM of $d$-wave altermagnets\\nis dominated by nonrelativistic SMOMs regardless of spin-orbit coupling.\\nMoreover, these nonrelativistic SMOMs exhibit a N\\\\'{e}el order dependence that\\nis predicted by the Landau theory of $d$-wave altermagnetism [Phys. Rev. Lett.\\n$\\\\textbf{132}$, 176702 (2024)].\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T08:20:36Z\"}"}
