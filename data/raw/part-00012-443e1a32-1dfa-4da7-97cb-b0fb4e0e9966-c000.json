In particular, we show that\\nmeasurable and topological recurrence in Weyl systems coincide. Our analysis\\nalso yields a structure theorem for polynomial multicorrelation sequences in\\nWeyl systems. These results stem from an in-depth study of the Weyl complexity\\nof a set of polynomials and the introduction of a new concept: the \\\\textit{Weyl\\npolynomials} generated by a set of polynomials.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:31:01Z\"}"}
