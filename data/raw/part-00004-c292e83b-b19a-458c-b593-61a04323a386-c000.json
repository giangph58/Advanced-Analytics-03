{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12908v1\", \"title\": \"Taccel: Scaling Up Vision-based Tactile Robotics via High-performance\\n  GPU Simulation\", \"summary\": \"Tactile sensing is crucial for achieving human-level robotic capabilities in\\nmanipulation tasks. VBTSs have emerged as a promising solution, offering high\\nspatial resolution and cost-effectiveness by sensing contact through\\ncamera-captured deformation patterns of elastic gel pads. However, these\\nsensors' complex physical characteristics and visual signal processing\\nrequirements present unique challenges for robotic applications. The lack of\\nefficient and accurate simulation tools for VBTS has significantly limited the\\nscale and scope of tactile robotics research. Here we present Taccel, a\\nhigh-performance simulation platform that integrates IPC and ABD to model\\nrobots, tactile sensors, and objects with both accuracy and unprecedented\\nspeed, achieving an 18-fold acceleration over real-time across thousands of\\nparallel environments. Unlike previous simulators that operate at sub-real-time\\nspeeds with limited parallelization, Taccel provides precise physics simulation\\nand realistic tactile signals while supporting flexible robot-sensor\\nconfigurations through user-friendly APIs. Through extensive validation in\\nobject recognition, robotic grasping, and articulated object manipulation, we\\ndemonstrate precise simulation and successful sim-to-real transfer. These\\ncapabilities position Taccel as a powerful tool for scaling up tactile robotics\\nresearch and development. By enabling large-scale simulation and\\nexperimentation with tactile sensing, Taccel accelerates the development of\\nmore capable robotic systems, potentially transforming how robots interact with\\nand understand their physical environment.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T12:57:11Z\"}"}
