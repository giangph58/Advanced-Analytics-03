{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00432v1\", \"title\": \"A Neural Network Mode for PX4 on Embedded Flight Controllers\", \"summary\": \"This paper contributes an open-sourced implementation of a neural-network\\nbased controller framework within the PX4 stack. We develop a custom module for\\ninference on the microcontroller while retaining all of the functionality of\\nthe PX4 autopilot. Policies trained in the Aerial Gym Simulator are converted\\nto the TensorFlow Lite format and then built together with PX4 and flashed to\\nthe flight controller. The policies substitute the control-cascade within PX4\\nto offer an end-to-end position-setpoint tracking controller directly providing\\nnormalized motor RPM setpoints. Experiments conducted in simulation and the\\nreal-world show similar tracking performance. We thus provide a flight-ready\\npipeline for testing neural control policies in the real world. The pipeline\\nsimplifies the deployment of neural networks on embedded flight controller\\nhardware thereby accelerating research on learning-based control. Both the\\nAerial Gym Simulator and the PX4 module are open-sourced at\\nhttps://github.com/ntnu-arl/aerial_gym_simulator and\\nhttps://github.com/SindreMHegre/PX4-Autopilot-public/tree/for_paper.
