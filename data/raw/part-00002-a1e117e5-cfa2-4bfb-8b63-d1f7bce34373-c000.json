In contrast to the previously developed doublet\\nformalism, which treats the Wigner degeneracy as a superficial label, the\\nsuperposition formalism encodes it directly into the structure of a unified\\nfield via a coherent superposition of degenerate spinor fields. By imposing the\\nLorentz covariance, causality, and canonical quantization, we derive nontrivial\\nconstraints on the field configuration, which uniquely identify the Elko field\\nas the consistent realization of the Wigner superposition field. Our analysis\\nfurther clarifies that although the Elko field is a spinor field, it possesses\\nmass dimension one and obeys the Klein-Gordon rather than the Dirac kinematics.\\nMoreover, we explore the general Elko representation through basis\\nredefinitions, showing that certain traditional properties, such as being\\neigenspinors of charge conjugation, are artifacts of specific basis choices\\nrather than intrinsic features. Finally, we discuss the physical implications\\nof Elko as a dark matter (DM) candidate. This work lays the foundation for a\\nsystematic reformulation of Elko interactions and its phenomenology as a viable\\ncomponent of DM.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T14:11:55Z\"}"}
