Our approach uses Fourier neural\\noperators to learn macroscopic traffic flow dynamics from high-fidelity\\nmicroscopic-level simulations. During inference, the operator functions as an\\nopen-loop predictor of traffic evolution. To close the loop, we couple the\\nopen-loop operator with a correction operator that combines the predicted\\ndensity with sparse measurements from the sensors. Simulations with the SUMO\\nsoftware indicate that, compared to open-loop observers, the proposed\\nclosed-loop observer exhibit classical closed-loop properties such as\\nrobustness to noise and ultimate boundedness of the error. This shows the\\nadvantages of combining learned physics with real-time corrections, and opens\\navenues for accurate, efficient, and interpretable data-driven observers.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T09:28:50Z\"}"}
