In particular, multiple\\nagents exist in the system which can only access partial information of the\\nmatrix parameters. This makes the classical solving method based on Riccati\\nequation with global information suffering. The main contribution is to present\\na distributed algorithm to derive the optimal controller which is consisting of\\nthe distributed iterations for the Riccati equation, a backward differential\\nequation driven by the optimal Lagrange multiplier and the optimal state.\\nFinally, a numerical example verifies the effectiveness of the proposed\\nalgorithm.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T03:19:16Z\"}"}
