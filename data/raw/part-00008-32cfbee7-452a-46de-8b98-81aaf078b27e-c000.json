{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10424v1\", \"title\": \"Lowering the Cost of Diamond Open Access Journals\", \"summary\": \"Many scholarly societies face challenges in adapting their publishing to an\\nopen access model where neither authors nor readers pay any fees. Some have\\nargued that one of the main barriers is the actual cost of publishing. The goal\\nof this paper is to show that the actual costs can be extremely low while still\\nmaintaining scholarly quality. We accomplish this by building a journal\\npublishing workflow that minimizes the amount of required human labor. We\\nrecently built a software system for this and launched a journal using the\\nsystem, and we estimate estimate our cost to publish this journal is\\napproximately \\\\$705 per year, plus \\\\$1 per article and about 10 minutes of\\nvolunteer labor per article. We benefited from two factors, namely the fact\\nthat authors in our discipline use LaTeX to prepare their manuscripts, and we\\nhad volunteer labor to develop software and run the journal. We have made most\\nof this software open source in the hopes that it can help others.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DL\", \"categories\": \"cs.DL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:13:45Z\"}"}
