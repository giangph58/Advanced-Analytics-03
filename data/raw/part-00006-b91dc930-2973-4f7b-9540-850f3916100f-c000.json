{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10276v1\", \"title\": \"Who Speaks for Ethics? How Demographics Shape Ethical Advocacy in\\n  Software Development\", \"summary\": \"The integration of ethics into software development faces significant\\nchallenges due to market fundamentalism in organizational practices, where\\nprofit often takes precedence over ethical considerations. Additionally, the\\ncritical influence of practitioners' individual backgrounds on ethical\\ndecision-making remains underexplored, highlighting a gap in comprehensive\\nresearch. This is especially essential to understand due to the demographic\\nimbalance in software roles. This study investigates ethical concerns in\\nsoftware development, focusing on how they are perceived, prioritized, and\\naddressed by demographically different practitioners. By surveying 217 software\\npractitioners across diverse roles, industries, and countries, we identify\\ncritical barriers to ethical integration and examine practitioners' capacity to\\nmitigate these issues. Our findings reveal pronounced demographic disparities,\\nwith marginalized groups - including women, BIPOC, and disabled individuals -\\nreporting ethical concerns at higher frequencies. Notably, marginalized\\npractitioners demonstrated heightened sensitivity to ethical implementation and\\ngreater empowerment to address them. However, practitioners overall often lack\\nthe support needed to address ethical challenges effectively. These insights\\nunderscore the urgent need for reforms in software education and development\\nprocesses that center on diverse perspectives. Such reforms are essential to\\nadvancing ethical integration in software development and ensuring responsible\\ncomputing practices in an increasingly complex technological landscape.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T14:43:57Z\"}"}
