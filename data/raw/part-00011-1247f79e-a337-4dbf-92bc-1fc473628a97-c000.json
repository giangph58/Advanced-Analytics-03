The formalism applies to nano-particles, clusters thereof, and\\nalso molecules. In exemplary applications, we explore how a chiral structure\\ncan induce an imbalance in the circular polarization of thermal radiation.\\nWhile the imbalance is rather small for a chiral molecule such as R-BINOL, a\\nmuch larger imbalance is observed for an optimized silver helix of\\napproximately 200 nm in size. Besides the directional Kirchhoff law used in\\nthis article, the formalism is suitable for implementing more nuanced theories,\\nand it provides a straightforward path to the computation of thermal radiation\\nspectra of astronomical objects moving at relativistic speeds with respect to\\nthe measurement devices.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T13:31:43Z\"}"}
