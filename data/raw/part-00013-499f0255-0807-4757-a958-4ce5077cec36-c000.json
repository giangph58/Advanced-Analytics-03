{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21434v1\", \"title\": \"Integration of a Synthetic Molecular Motor Into a Rotary DNA\\n  Nanostructure: A Framework for Single-Molecule Actuation\", \"summary\": \"Synthetic molecular motors are an appealing means to control motion at the\\nnanoscale, but understanding their behaviour as single-molecule actuators and\\nintegrating them into larger, functional systems remain technical challenges.\\nTranslating molecular actuation into coordinated device-level behaviour\\nrequires precise placement and orientation of the motors: DNA origami provides\\na powerful platform for positioning molecules with nanometre precision. Here,\\nwe demonstrate integration of a light-driven, rotary molecular motor into a\\nDNA-based nanoscale actuator through site-specific, four-point conjugation. The\\nmotor is labelled with four distinct oligonucleotides, two on each side, using\\nDNA-templated chemistry. This modular approach enables stable, oriented\\nincorporation of the motor into a DNA assembly through DNA hybridization. Upon\\nphotoactivation with UV light, the motor transduces photon energy into rotary\\nmotion. By coupling the motor to a fluorescently labelled DNA rotor arm we\\namplify its movement and enable real-time observation using total internal\\nreflection fluorescence microscopy. A subset of assembled devices exhibits\\nlight-induced conformational transitions and directional motion consistent with\\nthe expected photochemical mechanism. These results establish a programmable\\nframework for integration of light-driven molecular motors into synthetic\\nnanomachines and tools for the study of their behaviour.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T08:47:58Z\"}"}
