We introduce\\n\\\\datasetnamenospace, a benchmark of 140 yes/no questions from NASA Earth\\nObservatory articles across 13 topics and 17 satellite sensors. Using Google\\nEarth Engine API as a tool, LLM agents can only achieve an accuracy of 33%\\nbecause the code fails to run over 58% of the time. We improve the failure rate\\nfor open models by fine-tuning synthetic data, allowing much smaller models\\n(Llama-3.1-8B) to achieve comparable accuracy to much larger ones (e.g.,\\nDeepSeek-R1). Taken together, our findings identify significant challenges to\\nbe solved before AI agents can automate earth observation, and suggest paths\\nforward.
