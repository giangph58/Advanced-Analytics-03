{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00508v1\", \"title\": \"Weak Random Feature Method for Solving Partial Differential Equations\", \"summary\": \"The random feature method (RFM) has demonstrated great potential in bridging\\ntraditional numerical methods and machine learning techniques for solving\\npartial differential equations (PDEs). It retains the advantages of mesh-free\\napproaches while achieving spectral accuracy for smooth solutions, without the\\nneed for iterative procedures. However, the implementation of RFM in the\\nidentification of weak solutions remains a subject of limited comprehension,\\ndespite crucial role of weak solutions in addressing numerous applied problems.\\nWhile the direct application of RFM to problems without strong solutions is\\nfraught with potential challenges, we propose an enhancement to the original\\nrandom feature method that is specifically suited for finding weak solutions\\nand is termed as Weak RFM. Essentially, Weak RFM reformulates the original RFM\\nby adopting the weak form of the governing equations and constructing a new\\nlinear system through the use of carefully designed test functions, ensuring\\nthat the resulting solution satisfies the weak form by default. To rigorously\\nevaluate the performance of the proposed method, we conduct extensive\\nexperiments on a variety of benchmark problems, including challenging\\nthree-dimensional cases, and compare its performance with state of the art\\nmachine learning-based approaches. The results demonstrate that Weak RFM\\nachieves comparable or superior accuracy while significantly reducing\\ncomputational time and memory consumption, highlighting its potential as a\\nhighly efficient and robust tool for finding weak solutions to various PDE\\nproblems.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T13:25:17Z\"}"}
