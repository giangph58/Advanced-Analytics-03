{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11307v1\", \"title\": \"Uncertainty Estimation for Trust Attribution to Speed-of-Sound\\n  Reconstruction with Variational Networks\", \"summary\": \"Speed-of-sound (SoS) is a biomechanical characteristic of tissue, and its\\nimaging can provide a promising biomarker for diagnosis. Reconstructing SoS\\nimages from ultrasound acquisitions can be cast as a limited-angle\\ncomputed-tomography problem, with Variational Networks being a promising\\nmodel-based deep learning solution. Some acquired data frames may, however, get\\ncorrupted by noise due to, e.g., motion, lack of contact, and acoustic shadows,\\nwhich in turn negatively affects the resulting SoS reconstructions. We propose\\nto use the uncertainty in SoS reconstructions to attribute trust to each\\nindividual acquired frame. Given multiple acquisitions, we then use an\\nuncertainty based automatic selection among these retrospectively, to improve\\ndiagnostic decisions. We investigate uncertainty estimation based on Monte\\nCarlo Dropout and Bayesian Variational Inference. We assess our automatic frame\\nselection method for differential diagnosis of breast cancer, distinguishing\\nbetween benign fibroadenoma and malignant carcinoma. We evaluate 21 lesions\\nclassified as BI-RADS~4, which represents suspicious cases for probable\\nmalignancy. The most trustworthy frame among four acquisitions of each lesion\\nwas identified using uncertainty based criteria. Selecting a frame informed by\\nuncertainty achieved an area under curve of 76% and 80% for Monte Carlo Dropout\\nand Bayesian Variational Inference, respectively, superior to any\\nuncertainty-uninformed baselines with the best one achieving 64%. A novel use\\nof uncertainty estimation is proposed for selecting one of multiple data\\nacquisitions for further processing and decision making.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:48:51Z\"}"}
