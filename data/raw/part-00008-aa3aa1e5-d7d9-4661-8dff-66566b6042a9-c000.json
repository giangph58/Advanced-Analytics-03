Instrumental variables (IVs) are a popular remedy\\nfor this issue, but most existing methods either assume the validity of all IVs\\nor postulate a specific form of relationship, such as a linear model, between\\nthe primary variables and the IVs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce\\na partially linear structural equation model for causal discovery and inference\\nthat accommodates potentially invalid IVs and allows for general dependence of\\nthe primary variables on the IVs. We establish identification under this\\nsemiparametric model by constructing surrogate valid IVs, and develop a\\nfinite-sample procedure for estimating the causal structures and effects.\\nTheoretically, we show that our procedure consistently learns the causal\\nstructures, yields asymptotically normal estimates, and effectively controls\\nthe false discovery rate in edge recovery. Simulation studies demonstrate the\\nsuperiority of our method over existing competitors, and an application to\\ninferring gene regulatory networks in Alzheimer's disease illustrates its\\nusefulness.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T13:46:45Z\"}"}
