This design combines precision drift tubes\\nwith fast plastic scintillator strips to enable both spatial and timing\\nmeasurements. The drift tubes deliver two-dimensional position measurements\\nperpendicular to the tubes with a resolution around 100~$\\\\mu$m. Meanwhile, the\\nscintillator strips, read out with the wavelength-shifting fibers and silicon\\nphotomultipliers, provide fast timing information with a precision of 200~ps or\\nbetter and measure the third coordinate along the tubes with a resolution of\\nabout 1~mm.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex,physics.ins-det\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:38:24Z\"}"}
