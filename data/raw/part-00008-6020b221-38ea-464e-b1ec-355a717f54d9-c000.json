{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04184v1\", \"title\": \"State-of-the-Art HCI for Dementia Care: A Scoping Review of Recent\\n  Technological Advances\", \"summary\": \"Dementia significantly impacts cognitive, behavioral, and functional\\nabilities, creating challenges for both individuals and caregivers. Recent\\nadvancements in HCI have introduced innovative technological solutions to\\nsupport people with dementia (PwD) and their caregivers. This scoping review\\nsystematically examines 32 recent publications from leading digital libraries,\\ncategorizing technological interventions into four key domains: Assistive and\\nSmart Technology for Daily Life, Social Interaction and Communication,\\nWell-being and Psychological Support, and Caregiver Support and Training. Our\\nanalysis highlights how emerging technologies are transforming dementia care.\\nThese technologies enhance quality of life by promoting independence, fostering\\nsocial engagement, and providing emotional and cognitive support. However, the\\nreview also identifies critical gaps, particularly in addressing the needs of\\nindividuals with early-stage dementia and the lack of individualized support\\nmechanisms. By emphasizing user-centered design, accessibility, and ethical\\nconsiderations, this paper offers a structured roadmap for future research and\\npractice in dementia care. It bridges the gap between technological innovation\\nand the real-world needs of PwD and their caregivers, providing valuable\\ninsights for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. This review not only\\nsynthesizes current advancements but also sets the stage for future HCI-driven\\ninnovations in dementia care, aiming to improve outcomes for an aging global\\npopulation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T07:31:26Z\"}"}
