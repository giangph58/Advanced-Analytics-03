{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15103v1\", \"title\": \"Muon Imaging of Hydrotreatment Towers\", \"summary\": \"This study presents the design and simulation-based validation of a muon\\nimaging system tailored for potential applications in industrial hydrotreatment\\ntowers. The system is built around a two-panel plastic scintillator hodoscope,\\nequipped with silicon photomultipliers and read-out via a CAEN FERS-A5202\\nacquisition system. The detector was calibrated using a stepwise ``staircase''\\nmethod and characterized under open-sky and controlled conditions. We conducted\\nmuon flux attenuation measurements to validate its response using variable lead\\nshielding. We found agreement with simulations generated using the MEIGA\\nframework and realistic cosmic ray spectra from the ARTI simulation chain. With\\nthe detector response validated, we modelled muon transmission through a\\nrealistic 3D representation of a hydrotreatment tower, incorporating internal\\nvariations in catalyst bed density. By reconstructing angular muon fluxes and\\ncomputing relative attenuation maps, we demonstrated the system's capability to\\ndetect internal density contrasts. Simulation results indicate that 20~hours of\\nexposure to vertical muon flux is sufficient to retrieve structural\\ninformation. In comparison, inclined configurations (30$^\\\\circ$ and 60$^\\\\circ$\\nfrom vertical) require extended exposure times--up to 8~days--yet remain\\nfeasible within industrial monitoring schedules. These findings highlight the\\nfeasibility of muography as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for complex\\nindustrial infrastructure. The proposed system shows strong potential for\\nreal-time monitoring of catalyst bed integrity and long-term structural\\nanalysis in high-pressure chemical reactors.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T13:53:17Z\"}"}
