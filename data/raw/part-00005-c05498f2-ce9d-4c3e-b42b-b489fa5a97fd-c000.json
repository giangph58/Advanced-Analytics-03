Furthermore, the Kolmogorov-Arnold\\nrepresentation theorem provides a strong theoretical foundation for the\\ninterpretability and optimization of the network. We demonstrate the\\neffectiveness of the proposed method through numerical examples, involving both\\nsmooth and singular solutions in various dimensions. This work not only\\naddresses the challenges of solving high-dimensional and singular\\nMonge-Amp\\\\`ere equations but also highlights the potential of neural\\nnetwork-based approaches for complex partial differential equations.\\nAdditionally, the method is applied to the optimal transport problem in image\\nmapping, showcasing its practical utility in geometric image transformation.\\nThis approach is expected to pave the way for further enhancement of KAN-based\\napplications and numerical solutions of PDEs across a wide range of scientific\\nand engineering fields.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:47:47Z\"}"}
