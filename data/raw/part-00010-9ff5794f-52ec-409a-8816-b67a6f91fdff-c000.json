Communication using natural language statements that\\ndescribe the next action can provide transparency towards the agent's behavior.\\nWe aim to insert transparent behavior directly into the learning process, by\\ntransforming the problem of policy learning into a language generation problem\\nand combining it with traditional autoregressive modelling. The resulting model\\nproduces transparent natural language statements followed by tokens\\nrepresenting the specific actions to solve long-horizon tasks in the\\nLanguage-Table environment. Following previous work, the model is able to learn\\nto produce a policy represented by special discretized tokens in an\\nautoregressive manner. We place special emphasis on investigating the\\nrelationship between predicting actions and producing high-quality language for\\na transparent agent. We find that in many cases both the quality of the action\\ntrajectory and the transparent statement increase when they are generated\\nsimultaneously.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:57:37Z\"}"}
