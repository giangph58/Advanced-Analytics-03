{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03738v1\", \"title\": \"AMO: Adaptive Motion Optimization for Hyper-Dexterous Humanoid\\n  Whole-Body Control\", \"summary\": \"Humanoid robots derive much of their dexterity from hyper-dexterous\\nwhole-body movements, enabling tasks that require a large operational\\nworkspace: such as picking objects off the ground. However, achieving these\\ncapabilities on real humanoids remains challenging due to their high degrees of\\nfreedom (DoF) and nonlinear dynamics. We propose Adaptive Motion Optimization\\n(AMO), a framework that integrates sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) with\\ntrajectory optimization for real-time, adaptive whole-body control. To mitigate\\ndistribution bias in motion imitation RL, we construct a hybrid AMO dataset and\\ntrain a network capable of robust, on-demand adaptation to potentially O.O.D.\\ncommands. We validate AMO in simulation and on a 29-DoF Unitree G1 humanoid\\nrobot, demonstrating superior stability and an expanded workspace compared to\\nstrong baselines. Finally, we show that AMO's consistent performance supports\\nautonomous task execution via imitation learning, underscoring the system's\\nversatility and robustness.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T17:59:51Z\"}"}
