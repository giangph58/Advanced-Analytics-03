Unlike previous approaches relying on the\\nlight-cone gauge or symmetry-based constructions, our model retains full\\n11-dimensional Lorentz invariance by introducing a novel gauge-fixing condition\\nthat restricts the symmetry of volume-preserving deformations (VPD) to a\\nsubclass, which we call restricted VPD (RVPD). This restriction enables a\\nconsistent matrix regularization of the Nambu bracket, bypassing the\\nlong-standing obstructions related to the Leibniz rule and the Fundamental\\nIdentity. The resulting model exhibits RVPD symmetry, admits particle-like and\\nnoncommutative membrane solutions, and lays the foundation for a\\nLorentz-invariant, nonperturbative matrix description of M2-branes. Our work\\noffers a new paradigm for constructing Lorentz-invariant matrix models of\\nmembranes, revisiting the algebraic structure underlying M-theory.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T11:55:46Z\"}"}
