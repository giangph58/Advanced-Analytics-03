{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17487v1\", \"title\": \"Investigation of student and faculty problem solving: An example from\\n  quantum mechanics\", \"summary\": \"We describe a study focusing on students' and faculty members' reasoning\\nabout problems of differing cognitive complexity related to the double-slit\\nexperiment (DSE) with single particles. In the first phase of the study,\\nstudents in advanced quantum mechanics courses were asked these questions in\\nwritten form. Additionally, individual interviews were conducted with ten\\nstudents in which they were asked follow-up questions to make their thought\\nprocesses explicit on the challenging problems. Students did well on the\\nstraightforward problem, showing they had some knowledge of the DSE after\\ntraditional instruction, but they struggled on the more complex ones. Even if\\nexplicitly asked to do so in interviews, students were often uncomfortable\\nperforming calculations or making approximations and simplifications, instead\\npreferring to stick with their gut feeling. In the second phase of the study,\\nthe problems were broken down into more pointed questions to investigate\\nwhether students had knowledge of relevant concepts, whether they would do\\ncalculations as part of their solution approach if explicitly asked, and\\nwhether they explicitly noted using their gut feeling. While the faculty\\nmembers' responses suggest that they could seamlessly move between conceptual\\nand quantitative reasoning, most students were unable to combine concepts\\nrepresented by different equations to solve the problems quantitatively. We\\nconclude with instructional implications.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ed-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ed-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T12:25:36Z\"}"}
