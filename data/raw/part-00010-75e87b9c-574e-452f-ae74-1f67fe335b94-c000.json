Existing event deraining methods face\\ntrade-offs between temporal precision, deraining effectiveness, and\\ncomputational efficiency. In this paper, we propose PRE-Mamba, a novel\\npoint-based event camera deraining framework that fully exploits the\\nspatiotemporal characteristics of raw event and rain. Our framework introduces\\na 4D event cloud representation that integrates dual temporal scales to\\npreserve high temporal precision, a Spatio-Temporal Decoupling and Fusion\\nmodule (STDF) that enhances deraining capability by enabling shallow decoupling\\nand interaction of temporal and spatial information, and a Multi-Scale State\\nSpace Model (MS3M) that captures deeper rain dynamics across dual-temporal and\\nmulti-spatial scales with linear computational complexity. Enhanced by\\nfrequency-domain regularization, PRE-Mamba achieves superior performance (0.95\\nSR, 0.91 NR, and 0.4s/M events) with only 0.26M parameters on EventRain-27K, a\\ncomprehensive dataset with labeled synthetic and real-world sequences.\\nMoreover, our method generalizes well across varying rain intensities,\\nviewpoints, and even snowy conditions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:52:45Z\"}"}
