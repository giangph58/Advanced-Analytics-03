{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00501v1\", \"title\": \"Minimal Factorization of Chern-Simons Theory - Gravitational Anyonic\\n  Edge Modes\", \"summary\": \"One approach to analyzing entanglement in a gauge theory is embedding it into\\na factorized theory with edge modes on the entangling boundary. For topological\\nquantum field theories (TQFT), this naturally leads to factorizing a TQFT by\\nadding local edge modes associated with the corresponding CFT. In this work, we\\ninstead construct a minimal set of edge modes compatible with the topological\\ninvariance of Chern-Simons theory. This leads us to propose a minimal\\nfactorization map. These minimal edge modes can be interpreted as the degrees\\nof freedom of a particle on a quantum group. Of particular interest is\\nthree-dimensional gravity as a Chern-Simons theory with gauge group\\nSL$(2,\\\\mathbb{R}) \\\\times$ SL$(2,\\\\mathbb{R})$. Our minimal factorization\\nproposal uniquely gives rise to quantum group edge modes factorizing the bulk\\nstate space of 3d gravity. This agrees with earlier proposals that relate the\\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy in 3d gravity to topological entanglement entropy.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,math-ph,math.MP,math.QA,math.SG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T13:03:52Z\"}"}
