Understanding (IC 3475)-type galaxy, aka ultra-diffuse\\n  galaxy, structural scaling relations\", \"summary\": \"It is explained why ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs), a subset of (IC 3475)-type\\ngalaxies, do not have unexpectedly large sizes but large sizes that are in line\\nwith expectations from the curved size-luminosity relation defined by brighter\\nearly-type galaxies (ETGs). UDGs extend the faint end of the (absolute\\nmagnitude, $\\\\mathfrak{M}$)-log(S\\\\'ersic index, $n$) and $\\\\mathfrak{M}$-(central\\nsurface brightness, $\\\\mu_{\\\\rm 0}$) relations defined by ETGs, leading to the\\nlarge effective half-light radii, $R_{\\\\rm e}$, in UDGs. It is detailed how the\\nscatter in $\\\\mu_{\\\\rm 0}$, at a given $\\\\mathfrak{M}$, relates to variations in\\nthe galaxies' values of $n$ and effective surface brightness, $\\\\mu_{\\\\rm e}$.\\nThese variations map into changes in $R_{\\\\rm e}$ and produce the scatter about\\nthe $\\\\mathfrak{M}$-$R_{\\\\rm e}$ relation at fixed $\\\\mathfrak{M}$. Similarly, the\\nscatter in $\\\\mathfrak{M}$, at fixed $\\\\mu_{\\\\rm 0}$ and $n$, can be mapped into\\nchanges in $R_{\\\\rm e}$. The increased scatter about the faint end of the\\n$\\\\mathfrak{M}$-$R_{\\\\rm e}$ relation and the smaller scatter about\\n$\\\\mathfrak{M}$-(isophotal radii, $R_{\\\\rm iso}$) relations are explained.\\nArtificial and potentially misleading size-luminosity relations for UDGs are\\nalso addressed. The suggestion that there may be two types of UDG appears\\nill-founded, arising from the scatter about the $\\\\mathfrak{M}$-$\\\\mu_{\\\\rm 0}$\\nrelation, which persists at all magnitudes. Hopefully, the understanding\\npresented here will prove helpful for interpreting the many low surface\\nbrightness galaxies that the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope will detect.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T10:19:42Z\"}"}
