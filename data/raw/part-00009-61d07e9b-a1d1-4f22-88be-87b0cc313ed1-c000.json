{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01403v1\", \"title\": \"Generative Retrieval and Alignment Model: A New Paradigm for E-commerce\\n  Retrieval\", \"summary\": \"Traditional sparse and dense retrieval methods struggle to leverage general\\nworld knowledge and often fail to capture the nuanced features of queries and\\nproducts. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), industrial search\\nsystems have started to employ LLMs to generate identifiers for product\\nretrieval. Commonly used identifiers include (1) static/semantic IDs and (2)\\nproduct term sets. The first approach requires creating a product ID system\\nfrom scratch, missing out on the world knowledge embedded within LLMs. While\\nthe second approach leverages this general knowledge, the significant\\ndifference in word distribution between queries and products means that\\nproduct-based identifiers often do not align well with user search queries,\\nleading to missed product recalls. Furthermore, when queries contain numerous\\nattributes, these algorithms generate a large number of identifiers, making it\\ndifficult to assess their quality, which results in low overall recall\\nefficiency.\\n  To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel e-commerce\\nretrieval paradigm: the Generative Retrieval and Alignment Model (GRAM). GRAM\\nemploys joint training on text information from both queries and products to\\ngenerate shared text identifier codes, effectively bridging the gap between\\nqueries and products. This approach not only enhances the connection between\\nqueries and products but also improves inference efficiency. The model uses a\\nco-alignment strategy to generate codes optimized for maximizing retrieval\\nefficiency. Additionally, it introduces a query-product scoring mechanism to\\ncompare product values across different codes, further boosting retrieval\\nefficiency. Extensive offline and online A/B testing demonstrates that GRAM\\nsignificantly outperforms traditional models and the latest generative\\nretrieval models, confirming its effectiveness and practicality.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR,cs.AI,cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T06:40:09Z\"}"}
