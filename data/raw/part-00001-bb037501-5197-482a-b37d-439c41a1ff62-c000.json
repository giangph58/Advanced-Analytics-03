We\\nstudy how thermal radiation, separation distance and LED temperature can affect\\nboth cooling power and coefficient of performance. More specifically, we assess\\nthe impact of bandgap energy and internal quantum efficiency for an artificial\\nmaterial on those cooling performances. For a particular device made of GaAs\\nand/or AlGaAs we show that, in the near-field regime, the cooling power can be\\nincreased by one order of magnitude compared to far field. However, a 10%\\nreduction of the quantum efficiency can lead to a decrease of the cooling power\\nby two orders of magnitude. Finally, we compare existing literature data on\\nelectroluminescent, TPX and thermoelectric cooling with our detailed balance\\nprediction, which highlights design-rule requirements for NF-TPX cooling\\ndevices.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:38:17Z\"}"}
