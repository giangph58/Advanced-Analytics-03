The main novelty in our analysis is a time-dependent\\nversion of the classical bounded slope condition, imposed on the boundary data\\n$g$ along the lateral boundary $\\\\partial\\\\Omega\\\\times (0,T)$. More precisely, we\\nrequire that for each fixed $t\\\\in [0,T)$, the graph of $g(\\\\cdot ,t)$ over\\n$\\\\partial\\\\Omega$ admits supporting hyperplanes with slopes that may vary in\\ntime but remain uniformly bounded. The key to handling time-dependent data lies\\nin constructing more flexible upper and lower barriers.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T13:49:58Z\"}"}
