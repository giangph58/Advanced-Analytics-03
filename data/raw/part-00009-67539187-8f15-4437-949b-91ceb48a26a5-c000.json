We analyze both the TBF theory and the tropical analogue of 2D\\ntopological Yang-Mills theory (TrYM) through a direct path integral calculation\\nwhich probes a deformed analytic torsion and also through canonical\\nquantization. The explicit construction of the Hilbert space of TrYM theory\\ndemonstrates that the TrYM theory provides an example of a solvable field\\ntheory where anisotropy properties and topological invariance can\\nsimultaneously hold. We show that the partition function has an asymptotic\\nlimit, which verifies that the dimension of the moduli space of tropicalized\\nflat connection on a Riemann surface of genus $g>1$ is precisely given by\\n$(g-1) \\\\operatorname{rank}(\\\\mathfrak{g})$. We conjecture that the large $N$\\nexpansion of the associated matrix model of 2D TrYM is associated to the wedge\\nregion of nonequilibrium string theory.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T04:01:54Z\"}"}
