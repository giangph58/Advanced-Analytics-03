Still, it is an\\noutstanding challenge to resolve individual nuclear spins in a dense bath, in\\nwhich many of them exhibit a comparable coupling strength. This simultaneously\\nrequires a high spectral resolution and a large signal-to-noise ratio. However,\\nwhen probing spin ensembles, dipolar interactions between the dopants can lead\\nto a concentration-dependent trade-off between resolution and signal. Here, we\\nfully eliminate this limitation of previous optical-echo-envelope-modulation\\nspectroscopy experiments by integrating the emitters into a high-finesse\\nresonator, which allows for strong optical echoes even at very low\\nconcentrations. To demonstrate its potential, the technique is applied to\\nerbium dopants in yttrium-orthosilicate (Er:YSO). Achieving an unprecedented\\nspectral resolution enables precise measurements of the superhyperfine\\ninteraction with four of the Y nuclear spins densely surrounding each emitter.\\nThe achieved boost of the signal, enabled by the resonator, allows for\\nextending the approach to the lowest concentration possible -- to the level of\\nsingle dopants, thereby providing a tool for detecting and studying individual\\nnuclear spins. Thus, our technique paves the way for an improved understanding\\nof dense nuclear spin baths in solids.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.other\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T14:03:10Z\"}"}
