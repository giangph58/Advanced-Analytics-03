The resulting dynamics take the form of a stochastic\\ninteracting particle system having both a McKean-Vlasov type interaction and a\\npairwise interaction defined by the random disorder. We prove a\\npropagation-of-chaos result, showing that in the large system limit over\\ndimension-independent time horizons, the empirical distribution of sample paths\\nof the Langevin process converges to a deterministic limit law that is\\ndescribed by dynamical mean-field theory. This law is characterized by a system\\nof dynamical fixed-point equations for the limit of the drift parameter and for\\nthe correlation and response kernels of the limiting dynamics. Using a\\ndynamical cavity argument, we verify that these correlation and response\\nkernels arise as the asymptotic limits of the averaged correlation and linear\\nresponse functions of single coordinates of the system. These results enable an\\nasymptotic analysis of an empirical Bayes Langevin dynamics procedure for\\nlearning an unknown prior parameter in a linear regression model, which we\\ndevelop in a companion paper.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,math.PR,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T03:20:58Z\"}"}
