Simulated\\nspectra were generated under realistic observational conditions resembling the\\nSubaru Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS). We found that our U-Net model\\neffectively captured spectral features, achieving an average relative error of\\naround $1\\\\%$ across a broad range of stellar parameters, despite a limited\\ntraining set of only $1000$ observations and a relatively short training\\nperiod. Although U-Net did not reach the performance previously demonstrated by\\nfully-connected denoising autoencoders (DAEs) consisting of dense layers and\\ntrained extensively on larger datasets, it outperformed dense networks trained\\nunder similarly constrained conditions. These results indicate that the U-Net\\narchitecture offers rapid, robust feature learning and may be particularly\\nadvantageous in scenarios involving initial denoising, subsequently refined by\\nmore accurate, but otherwise slower deep-learning models.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T12:27:14Z\"}"}
