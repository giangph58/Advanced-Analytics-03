Here, we\\npresent a unified framework for LD Carnot-like (CL) HEs, REs, and HPs that\\nincorporates heat leaks, and derive new results for the efficiency at maximum\\npower and the power at maximum efficiency. We further investigate the\\nrelationship between the bounds of power at fixed efficiency and efficiency at\\nfixed power, demonstrating that these bounds coincide and are described by\\nidentical curves across all thermal devices. Finally, we show that the optimal\\nperformance of all three devices can be achieved by optimizing the average\\nentropy production rate over the cycle, a result that holds for any CL device\\nand extends beyond the LD assumption.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T05:32:29Z\"}"}
