This review combines\\ntwo decades of open-source and public-domain research on HPC-accelerated CFD in\\ndefense, addressing three key questions: Which security-sensitive simulations\\nhave utilized open-source CFD frameworks such as OpenFOAM, SU2 and ADflow?\\nWhich HPC techniques, such as MPI domain decomposition and GPU acceleration\\ntogether with hybrid parallelism best enhance open-source frameworks to manage\\nlarge defense CFD simulations? Which technological advancements and research\\nvoids currently drive the directional development of the field? Examining\\nseveral research studies sourced from NASA, DoD HPC centers, and academic\\ninstitutions, scientific contributions have been classified into air, maritime,\\nand space domains. Modular frameworks like NavyFOAM and SU2 and ADflow's\\nadjoint-based solvers show how custom open-source solutions support workflows\\nwith rapid completion of multi-million cell simulations. The conclusion\\nhighlights new trends that combine exascale readiness with machine learning\\nsurrogate models for real-time CFD applications and interdisciplinary\\nHPC-driven multi-physics integration to deliver practical insights for\\nimproving CFD use in defense research and development.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CE\", \"categories\": \"cs.CE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:13:33Z\"}"}
