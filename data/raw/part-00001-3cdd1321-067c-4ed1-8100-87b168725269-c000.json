{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03397v1\", \"title\": \"Quantum Feature Space of a Qubit Coupled to an Arbitrary Bath\", \"summary\": \"Qubit control protocols have traditionally leveraged a characterisation of\\nthe qubit-bath coupling via its power spectral density. Previous work proposed\\nthe inference of noise operators that characterise the influence of a classical\\nbath using a grey-box approach that combines deep neural networks with\\nphysics-encoded layers. This overall structure is complex and poses challenges\\nin scaling and real-time operations. Here, we show that no expensive neural\\nnetworks are needed and that this noise operator description admits an\\nefficient parameterisation. We refer to the resulting parameter space as the\\n\\\\textit{quantum feature space} of the qubit dynamics resulting from the coupled\\nbath. We show that the Euclidean distance defined over the quantum feature\\nspace provides an effective method for classifying noise processes in the\\npresence of a given set of controls. Using the quantum feature space as the\\ninput space for a simple machine learning algorithm (random forest, in this\\ncase), we demonstrate that it can effectively classify the stationarity and the\\nbroad class of noise processes perturbing a qubit. Finally, we explore how\\ncontrol pulse parameters map to the quantum feature space.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T10:25:50Z\"}"}
