{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20034v1\", \"title\": \"Pan-genome Analysis of Angiosperm Plastomes using PGR-TK\", \"summary\": \"We present a novel approach for taxonomic analysis of chloroplast genomes in\\nangiosperms using the Pan-genome Research Toolkit (PGR-TK). Comparative plots\\ngenerated by PGR-TK across diverse angiosperm genera reveal a wide range of\\nstructural complexity, from straightforward to highly intricate patterns.\\nNotably, the characteristic quadripartite plastome structure, comprising the\\nlarge single copy (LSC), small single copy (SSC), and inverted repeat (IR)\\nregions, is clearly identifiable in over 75% of the genera analyzed. Our\\nfindings also underscore several occurrences of species mis-annotations in\\npublic genomic databases, which are readily detected through visual anomalies\\nin the PGR-TK plots. While more complex plot patterns remain difficult to\\ninterpret, they likely reflect underlying biological variation or technical\\ninconsistencies in genome assembly. Overall, this approach effectively\\nintegrates classical botanical visualization with modern molecular taxonomy,\\nproviding a powerful tool for genome-based classification in plant systematics.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.GN\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.GN,q-bio.BM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:56:13Z\"}"}
