{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24145v1\", \"title\": \"Resonance: Drawing from Memories to Imagine Positive Futures through\\n  AI-Augmented Journaling\", \"summary\": \"People inherently use experiences of their past while imagining their future,\\na capability that plays a crucial role in mental health. Resonance is an\\nAI-powered journaling tool designed to augment this ability by offering\\nAI-generated, action-oriented suggestions for future activities based on the\\nuser's own past memories. Suggestions are offered when a new memory is logged\\nand are followed by a prompt for the user to imagine carrying out the\\nsuggestion. In a two-week randomized controlled study (N=55), we found that\\nusing Resonance significantly improved mental health outcomes, reducing the\\nusers' PHQ8 scores, a measure of current depression, and increasing their daily\\npositive affect, particularly when they would likely act on the suggestion.\\nNotably, the effectiveness of the suggestions was higher when they were\\npersonal, novel, and referenced the user's logged memories. Finally, through\\nopen-ended feedback, we discuss the factors that encouraged or hindered the use\\nof the tool.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:30:47Z\"}"}
