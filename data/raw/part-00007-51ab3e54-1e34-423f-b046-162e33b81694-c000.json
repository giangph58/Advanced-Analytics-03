Birefringence in\\ntest mass mirrors of gravitational wave detectors can become an important\\nfactor for both current and next-generation gravitational wave detectors to\\nachieve improved performance. In-situ birefringence characterization can become\\nan essential diagnostic tool for detector performance, and needs to be\\nestablished. We report a possible in-situ birefringence characterization method\\nand its experimental results with a tabletop setup. The scheme proposed and\\ndemonstrated in this paper can be used as a diagnostic tool in large-scale\\ngravitational wave detectors. We also discuss possible technological\\ndevelopments toward implementation in future gravitational wave detectors.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det,astro-ph.IM,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T12:48:14Z\"}"}
