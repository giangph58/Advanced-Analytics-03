{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17640v1\", \"title\": \"A modular framework for generalized Hurwitz class numbers III\", \"summary\": \"In $2003$, Pei and Wang introduced higher level analogs of the classical\\nCohen--Eisenstein series. In recent joint work with Beckwith, we found a weight\\n$\\\\frac{1}{2}$ sesquiharmonic preimage of their weight $\\\\frac{3}{2}$ Eisenstein\\nseries under $\\\\xi_{\\\\frac{1}{2}}$ utilizing a construction from seminal work by\\nDuke, Imamo\\\\={g}lu and T\\\\'{o}th. In further joint work with Beckwith, when\\nrestricting to prime level, we realized our preimage as a regularized Siegel\\ntheta lift and evaluated its (regularized) Fourier coefficients explicitly.\\nThis relied crucially on work by Bruinier, Funke and Imamo\\\\={g}lu. In this\\npaper, we extend both works to higher weights. That is, we provide a harmonic\\npreimage of Pei and Wang's generalized Cohen--Eisenstein series under\\n$\\\\xi_{\\\\frac{3}{2}-k}$, where $k > 1$. Furthermore, when restricting to prime\\nlevel, we realize them as outputs of a regularized Shintani theta lift of a\\nhigher level holomorphic Eisenstein series, which builds on recent work by\\nAlfes and Schwagenscheidt. Lastly, we evaluate the regularized Millson theta\\nlift of a higher level Maass--Eisenstein series, which is known to be connected\\nto the Shintani theta lift by a differential equation by earlier work of Alfes\\nand Schwagenscheidt.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:10:57Z\"}"}
