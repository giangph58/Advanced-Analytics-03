To achieve robust policy learning and generalization, we opt to\\nlearn a world model of the 3D rigid body dynamics involved in non-prehensile\\nmanipulations and use it for model-based reinforcement learning. We propose\\nPIN-WM, a Physics-INformed World Model that enables efficient end-to-end\\nidentification of a 3D rigid body dynamical system from visual observations.\\nAdopting differentiable physics simulation, PIN-WM can be learned with only\\nfew-shot and task-agnostic physical interaction trajectories. Further, PIN-WM\\nis learned with observational loss induced by Gaussian Splatting without\\nneeding state estimation. To bridge Sim2Real gaps, we turn the learned PIN-WM\\ninto a group of Digital Cousins via physics-aware randomizations which perturb\\nphysics and rendering parameters to generate diverse and meaningful variations\\nof the PIN-WM. Extensive evaluations on both simulation and real-world tests\\ndemonstrate that PIN-WM, enhanced with physics-aware digital cousins,\\nfacilitates learning robust non-prehensile manipulation skills with Sim2Real\\ntransfer, surpassing the Real2Sim2Real state-of-the-arts.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T13:27:07Z\"}"}
