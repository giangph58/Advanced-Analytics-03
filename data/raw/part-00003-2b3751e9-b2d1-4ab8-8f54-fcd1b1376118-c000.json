{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10312v1\", \"title\": \"Investigating two-zero texture in the light of gauged Type-II seesaw\", \"summary\": \"Neutrino oscillation, discovered over two decades ago, confirmed that\\nneutrinos have nonzero masses. Since then, two mass-squared differences have\\nbeen measured with unprecedented precision, yet the absolute neutrino mass\\nscale remains unknown. Additionally, the fundamental symmetry governing the\\nneutrino mixing pattern is still undetermined. Among various theoretical\\npossibilities, the two-zero texture in the neutrino mass matrix ($m_\\\\nu$)\\nstands out as an attractive framework due to its reduced number of free\\nparameters, enabling definite predictions for the unknown parameters of the\\nPMNS matrix. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the two-zero\\ntexture, focusing on its implications for the Dirac CP phase ($\\\\delta$) and the\\neffective Majorana mass ($m_{\\\\beta\\\\beta}$), the latter being crucial for\\nneutrinoless double beta decay. We find that for certain two-zero textures,\\n$m_{\\\\beta\\\\beta}$ reaches a few tens of meV, placing it within the sensitivity\\nrange of KamLAND-Zen. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a two-zero texture can\\nnaturally emerge in a well-motivated neutrino mass model, specifically the\\ngauged Type-II seesaw mechanism, which requires multiple scalar triplets.\\nNotably, some two-zero patterns cannot be realized in this framework, as more\\nthan two independent zeros can appear in $m_\\\\nu$. Finally, we discuss key\\nphenomenological consequences of the gauged Type-II seesaw model.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T15:20:13Z\"}"}
