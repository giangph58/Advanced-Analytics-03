{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12729v1\", \"title\": \"Dead Gate Elimination\", \"summary\": \"Hybrid quantum algorithms combine the strengths of quantum and classical\\ncomputing. Many quantum algorithms, such as the variational quantum eigensolver\\n(VQE), leverage this synergy. However, quantum circuits are executed in full,\\neven when only subsets of measurement outcomes contribute to subsequent\\nclassical computations. In this manuscript, we propose a novel circuit\\noptimization technique that identifies and removes dead gates. We prove that\\nthe removal of dead gates has no influence on the probability distribution of\\nthe measurement outcomes that contribute to the subsequent calculation result.\\nWe implemented and evaluated our optimization on a VQE instance, a quantum\\nphase estimation (QPE) instance, and hybrid programs embedded with random\\ncircuits of varying circuit width, confirming its capability to remove a\\nnon-trivial number of dead gates in real-world algorithms. The effect of our\\noptimization scales up as more measurement outcomes are identified as\\nnon-contributory, resulting in a proportionally greater reduction of dead\\ngates.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.PL,cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T08:10:59Z\"}"}
