Our main result is a quantitative estimate for the error\\nterm of such averages valid for smooth functions under some effective mixing\\nassumptions on the action. With the aid of this theorem, we investigate\\nmultiplicative-type Dirichlet-improvability for $(m\\\\times n)$-matrices with\\nreal coefficients. In particular, we establish that almost all matrices are\\nuniformly approximable by the function $x\\\\mapsto x^{-1}(\\\\log\\nx)^{-1+\\\\varepsilon}$ for any $\\\\varepsilon>0$. Results of this type motivate a\\nquestion which can be thought as a strengthening of Littlewood's conjecture in\\nmultiplicative Diophantine approximation.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT,math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T04:01:49Z\"}"}
