We derive an explicit Wedderburn-like\\ndecomposition of finite split metacyclic group algebras over fields with\\ncharacteristic coprime to the group order. Utilizing this decomposition, we\\ndevelop a systematic theory of metacyclic codes, providing their algebraic\\ndescription and proving that they can be viewed as generalized concatenated\\ncodes with cyclic inner codes and skew quasi-cyclic outer codes. We establish\\nbounds on the minimum distance of metacyclic codes and investigate the class of\\ninduced codes. Furthermore, we show the feasibility of constructing a partial\\nkey-recovery attack against certain McEliece-type cryptosystems based on\\nmetacyclic codes by exploiting their generalized concatenated structure.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT,math.RA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T10:43:23Z\"}"}
