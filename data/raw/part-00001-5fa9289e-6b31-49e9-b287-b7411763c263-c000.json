{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01955v1\", \"title\": \"Scene-Centric Unsupervised Panoptic Segmentation\", \"summary\": \"Unsupervised panoptic segmentation aims to partition an image into\\nsemantically meaningful regions and distinct object instances without training\\non manually annotated data. In contrast to prior work on unsupervised panoptic\\nscene understanding, we eliminate the need for object-centric training data,\\nenabling the unsupervised understanding of complex scenes. To that end, we\\npresent the first unsupervised panoptic method that directly trains on\\nscene-centric imagery. In particular, we propose an approach to obtain\\nhigh-resolution panoptic pseudo labels on complex scene-centric data, combining\\nvisual representations, depth, and motion cues. Utilizing both pseudo-label\\ntraining and a panoptic self-training strategy yields a novel approach that\\naccurately predicts panoptic segmentation of complex scenes without requiring\\nany human annotations. Our approach significantly improves panoptic quality,\\ne.g., surpassing the recent state of the art in unsupervised panoptic\\nsegmentation on Cityscapes by 9.4% points in PQ.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T17:58:46Z\"}"}
