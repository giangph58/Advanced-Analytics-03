Existing studies suggest that LLM generations can be\\nsubjectively grounded to some extent, yet exploring whether LLMs can account\\nfor individual-level subjectivity has not been sufficiently studied. In this\\npaper, we characterize subjectivity of individuals on social media and infer\\ntheir moral judgments using LLMs. We propose a framework, SOLAR (Subjective\\nGround with Value Abstraction), that observes value conflicts and trade-offs in\\nthe user-generated texts to better represent subjective ground of individuals.\\nEmpirical results show that our framework improves overall inference results as\\nwell as performance on controversial situations. Additionally, we qualitatively\\nshow that SOLAR provides explanations about individuals' value preferences,\\nwhich can further account for their judgments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T04:20:05Z\"}"}
