{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12202v1\", \"title\": \"Correlations as a resource in molecular switches\", \"summary\": \"Photoisomerization, a photochemical process underlying many biological\\nmechanisms, has been modeled recently within the quantum resource theory of\\nthermodynamics. This approach has emerged as a promising tool for studying\\nfundamental limitations to nanoscale processes independently of the microscopic\\ndetails governing their dynamics. On the other hand, correlations between\\nphysical systems have been shown to play a crucial role in quantum\\nthermodynamics by lowering the work cost of certain operations. Here, we\\nexplore quantitatively how correlations between multiple photoswitches can\\nenhance the efficiency of photoisomerization beyond that attainable for single\\nmolecules. Furthermore, our analysis provides insights into the interplay\\nbetween quantum and classical correlations in these transformations.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T15:52:59Z\"}"}
