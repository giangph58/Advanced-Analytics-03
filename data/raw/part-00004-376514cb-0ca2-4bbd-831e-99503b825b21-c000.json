We design a set of losses that\\nensures that these neural bases satisfy fundamental physical properties such as\\northogonality, divergence-free, boundary alignment, and smoothness. Our neural\\nbases can then be used to fit an input sketch of a flow, which will inherit the\\nsame fundamental properties from the bases. We then can animate such flow in\\nreal-time using standard time integrators. Our neural bases can accommodate\\ndifferent domains and naturally extend to three dimensions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GR\", \"categories\": \"cs.GR,cs.LG,physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T07:28:28Z\"}"}
