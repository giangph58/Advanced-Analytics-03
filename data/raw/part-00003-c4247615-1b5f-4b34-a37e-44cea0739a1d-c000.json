The results demonstrate that these two metal nanowires\\nfollow notably different stress - strain trends, with silver wires exhibiting\\ngreater elastic stiffness and higher yield points at equivalent diameters - an\\neffect likely rooted in silver's stronger atomic bonding and more stable\\nmicrostructure. A pronounced size effect is observed: as the wire diameter\\ndiminishes, both the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength increase\\nsubstantially, a behavior driven by the higher proportion of surface atoms that\\nenhance dislocation nucleation and mobility. Atomistic analyses further\\nunderscore the dominant role of dislocations during plastic deformation, and in\\nparticular reveal that surface - initiated dislocations in thinner wires\\ncritically affect their fracture behavior.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T08:47:27Z\"}"}
