{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06829v1\", \"title\": \"Adaptive Locally Linear Embedding\", \"summary\": \"Manifold learning techniques, such as Locally linear embedding (LLE), are\\ndesigned to preserve the local neighborhood structures of high-dimensional data\\nduring dimensionality reduction. Traditional LLE employs Euclidean distance to\\ndefine neighborhoods, which can struggle to capture the intrinsic geometric\\nrelationships within complex data. A novel approach, Adaptive locally linear\\nembedding(ALLE), is introduced to address this limitation by incorporating a\\ndynamic, data-driven metric that enhances topological preservation. This method\\nredefines the concept of proximity by focusing on topological neighborhood\\ninclusion rather than fixed distances. By adapting the metric based on the\\nlocal structure of the data, it achieves superior neighborhood preservation,\\nparticularly for datasets with complex geometries and high-dimensional\\nstructures. Experimental results demonstrate that ALLE significantly improves\\nthe alignment between neighborhoods in the input and feature spaces, resulting\\nin more accurate and topologically faithful embeddings. This approach advances\\nmanifold learning by tailoring distance metrics to the underlying data,\\nproviding a robust solution for capturing intricate relationships in\\nhigh-dimensional datasets.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T12:40:13Z\"}"}
