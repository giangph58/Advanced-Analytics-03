Evidence from an Agent-Based Model\", \"summary\": \"Affective polarization, or, inter-party hostility, is increasingly recognized\\nas a pervasive issue in democracies worldwide, posing a threat to social\\ncohesion. The digital media ecosystem, now widely accessible and ever-present,\\nhas often been implicated in accelerating this phenomenon. However, the precise\\ncausal mechanisms responsible for driving affective polarization have been a\\nsubject of extensive debate. While the concept of echo chambers, characterized\\nby individuals ensconced within like-minded groups, bereft of\\ncounter-attitudinal content, has long been the prevailing hypothesis,\\naccumulating empirical evidence suggests a more nuanced picture. This study\\naims to contribute to the ongoing debate by employing an agent-based model to\\nillustrate how affective polarization is either fostered or hindered by\\nindividual news consumption and dissemination patterns based on ideological\\nalignment. To achieve this, we parameterize three key aspects: (1) The\\naffective asymmetry of individuals' engagement with in-party versus out-party\\ncontent, (2) The proportion of in-party members within one's social\\nneighborhood, and (3) The degree of partisan bias among the elites within the\\npopulation. Subsequently, we observe macro-level changes in affective\\npolarization within the population under various conditions stipulated by these\\nparameters. This approach allows us to explore the intricate dynamics of\\naffective polarization within digital environments, shedding light on the\\ninterplay between individual behaviors, social networks, and information\\nexposure.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MA\", \"categories\": \"cs.MA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T10:00:50Z\"}"}
