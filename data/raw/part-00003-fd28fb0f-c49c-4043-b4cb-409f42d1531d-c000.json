{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06190v1\", \"title\": \"No-scale supergravity\", \"summary\": \"To connect supergravity with the real world, a highly non-trivial requirement\\nis complete spontaneous supersymmetry breaking in an approximately flat\\nfour-dimensional space-time. In no-scale supergravity models, this naturally\\nhappens at the classical level: the gravitino mass, setting the scale of\\nsupersymmetry breaking, slides along a flat direction of the potential with\\nvanishing energy. This contribution briefly describes, with a personal\\nselection of simple illustrative examples, some qualitative features of\\nno-scale models that relate them to a possible dynamical generation of the\\nhierarchies between the vacuum energy scale, the weak scale and the Planck\\nscale. It includes comments on their versions with extended supersymmetry, on\\ntheir higher-dimensional origin and on how their still unsolved problems of\\nquantum stability can already be addressed, with some results, at the level of\\nsupergravity compactifications, although their solution (if any) will\\neventually require a better understanding of superstring theories.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T16:34:09Z\"}"}
