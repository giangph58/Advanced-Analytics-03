Low-energy model studies suggest $^{238}$U may have a modest\\noctupole deformation arising from collective vibrational degrees of freedom, in\\naddition to a large prolate shape. We investigated the impact of this modest\\noctupole shape on observables involving triangular flow ($v_3$) in high-energy\\nnuclear collisions. Using a hydrodynamic framework, we show $v_3$ and its\\ncorrelation with mean transverse momentum, $\\\\langle v_3^2 \\\\delta\\\\pT \\\\rangle$,\\nexhibit strong sensitivity to $\\\\beta_3$. We found that $\\\\langle v_3^2\\\\rangle$\\nfollows a linear increase with $\\\\beta_3^2$, while $\\\\langle v_3^2 \\\\delta\\\\pT\\n\\\\rangle$ is suppressed in the presence of $\\\\beta_3$. Our findings show that the\\ncollective-flow-assisted nuclear imaging method in high-energy nuclear\\ncollisions, when compared with experimental data, can provide unique\\nconstraints on higher-order deformations.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T17:17:33Z\"}"}
