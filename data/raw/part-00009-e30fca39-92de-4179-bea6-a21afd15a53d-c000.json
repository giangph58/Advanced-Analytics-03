{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15573v1\", \"title\": \"Instruction-Tuning Data Synthesis from Scratch via Web Reconstruction\", \"summary\": \"The improvement of LLMs' instruction-following capabilities depends\\ncritically on the availability of high-quality instruction-response pairs.\\nWhile existing automatic data synthetic methods alleviate the burden of manual\\ncuration, they often rely heavily on either the quality of seed data or strong\\nassumptions about the structure and content of web documents. To tackle these\\nchallenges, we propose Web Reconstruction (WebR), a fully automated framework\\nfor synthesizing high-quality instruction-tuning (IT) data directly from raw\\nweb documents with minimal assumptions. Leveraging the inherent diversity of\\nraw web content, we conceptualize web reconstruction as an instruction-tuning\\ndata synthesis task via a novel dual-perspective paradigm--Web as Instruction\\nand Web as Response--where each web document is designated as either an\\ninstruction or a response to trigger the reconstruction process. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that datasets generated by WebR outperform state-of-the-art\\nbaselines by up to 16.65% across four instruction-following benchmarks.\\nNotably, WebR demonstrates superior compatibility, data efficiency, and\\nscalability, enabling enhanced domain adaptation with minimal effort.
