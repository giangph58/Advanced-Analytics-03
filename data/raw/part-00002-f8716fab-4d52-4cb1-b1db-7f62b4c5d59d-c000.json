{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17706v1\", \"title\": \"Inverse problem in the LaMET framework\", \"summary\": \"One proposal to compute parton distributions from first principles is the\\nlarge momentum effective theory (LaMET), which requires the Fourier transform\\nof matrix elements computed non-perturbatively. Lattice quantum chromodynamics\\n(QCD) provides calculations of these matrix elements over a finite range of\\nFourier harmonics that are often noisy or unreliable in the largest computed\\nharmonics. It has been suggested that enforcing an exponential decay of the\\nmissing harmonics helps alleviate this issue. Using non-perturbative data, we\\nshow that the uncertainty introduced by this inverse problem in a realistic\\nsetup remains significant without very restrictive assumptions, and that the\\nimportance of the exact asymptotic behavior is minimal for values of $x$ where\\nthe framework is currently applicable. We show that the crux of the inverse\\nproblem lies in harmonics of the order of $\\\\lambda=zP_z \\\\sim 5-15$, where the\\nsignal in the lattice data is often barely existent in current studies, and the\\nasymptotic behavior is not firmly established. We stress the need for more\\nsophisticated techniques to account for this inverse problem, whether in the\\nLaMET or related frameworks like the short-distance factorization. We also\\naddress a misconception that, with available lattice methods, the LaMET\\nframework allows a \\\"direct\\\" computation of the $x$-dependence, whereas the\\nalternative short-distance factorization only gives access to moments or fits\\nof the $x$-dependence.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-lat\", \"categories\": \"hep-lat,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T16:11:48Z\"}"}
