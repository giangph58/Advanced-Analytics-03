Investigation of such\\neffects is often hampered by the limited availability of data. Online chess has\\nexploded in popularity in recent years and provides vast amounts of data which\\ncan be used to explore this question. With a hierarchical Bayesian regression\\nmodel, we carefully investigate the presence of such experiential effects in\\nonline chess. Using a large quantity of online chess data, we see little\\nevidence for experiential effects that are consistent across all players, with\\nsome individual players showing some evidence for such effects. Given the\\nchallenging temporal nature of this data, we discuss several methods for\\nassessing the suitability of our model and carefully check its validity.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:24:48Z\"}"}
