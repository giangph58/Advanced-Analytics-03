{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12722v1\", \"title\": \"SimUSER: Simulating User Behavior with Large Language Models for\\n  Recommender System Evaluation\", \"summary\": \"Recommender systems play a central role in numerous real-life applications,\\nyet evaluating their performance remains a significant challenge due to the gap\\nbetween offline metrics and online behaviors. Given the scarcity and limits\\n(e.g., privacy issues) of real user data, we introduce SimUSER, an agent\\nframework that serves as believable and cost-effective human proxies. SimUSER\\nfirst identifies self-consistent personas from historical data, enriching user\\nprofiles with unique backgrounds and personalities. Then, central to this\\nevaluation are users equipped with persona, memory, perception, and brain\\nmodules, engaging in interactions with the recommender system. SimUSER exhibits\\ncloser alignment with genuine humans than prior work, both at micro and macro\\nlevels. Additionally, we conduct insightful experiments to explore the effects\\nof thumbnails on click rates, the exposure effect, and the impact of reviews on\\nuser engagement. Finally, we refine recommender system parameters based on\\noffline A/B test results, resulting in improved user engagement in the real\\nworld.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T07:57:23Z\"}"}
