This is especially true of complex designs such as\\nsoft processors.\\n  In this work we implement a soft GPGPU which exceeds 950 MHz in an Altera\\nAgilex-7 FPGA. The architecture is a 32-bit fixed point Single Instruction,\\nMultiple Thread (SIMT) design, with parameterized thread and register spaces.\\nUp to 4096 threads and 64K registers can be specified by the user. In one\\nexample, a processor with 16K registers and a 16KB shared memory required\\napproximately 7K ALMs, 99 M20K memories, and 32 DSP Blocks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AR\", \"categories\": \"cs.AR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T08:05:36Z\"}"}
