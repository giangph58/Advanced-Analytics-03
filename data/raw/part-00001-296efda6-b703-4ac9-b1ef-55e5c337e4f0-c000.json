{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05372v1\", \"title\": \"Fourier-based Inversion of Partial X-ray Transforms in $n$ Dimensions\", \"summary\": \"We present two theorems describing analytic left-inverses of partial X-ray\\ntransforms. The first theorem concerns X-ray data collected with an arbitrary\\ndistribution of parallel projections; it contains a convolution-backprojection\\nformula and a backprojection-convolution formula for recovering the transformed\\nvolume, provided the data is sufficient. The second theorem concerns X-ray data\\ncollected with a cone-beam; it contains a backprojection-convolution formula\\nfor recovering the transformed volume, provided the data is amenable to this\\nmethod. The cone-beam method is usable for X-ray source point loci that are\\nmultidimensional and that adequately surround the reconstruction support; it\\nsupports data collected with a flat 2D detector of finite size.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.med-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.med-ph,math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T16:07:26Z\"}"}
