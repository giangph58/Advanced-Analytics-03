By combining DESI DR2 data\\nwith the TCC criterion, we impose tight constraints on the dark energy equation\\nof state and its parameter space in scenarios such as the\\nChevallier-Polarski-Linder, Barboza-Alcaniz, Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan, EXP and\\nLOG parameterizations, significantly constraining the quintom-A behavior. Also\\nwe examine models within the framework of $f(T)$ and $f(Q)$ modified gravity\\ntheories, demonstrating that TCC is very powerful to constrain or exclude them,\\na result that indicates the necessity to consider infrared modifications on\\nGeneral Relativity apart from the usual ultraviolet ones. Our findings imply\\nthat viable dynamical dark energy scenarios must asymptotically transit to\\ndeceleration, shedding light on new physics consistent with both cosmological\\nobservations and quantum gravity principles.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:27:03Z\"}"}
