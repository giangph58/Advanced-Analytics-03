If this is the case, then, in particular, the decimal representations of\\nthese constants should tend to satisfy the central limit theorem (CLT) and the\\nlaw of the iterated logarithm (LIL). The paper presents the results of a direct\\nstatistical analysis of the decimal representations of 12 mathematical\\nconstants with respect to the central limit theorem (CLT) and the law of the\\niterated logarithm (LIL). The first billion digits of each constant were\\nanalyzed, with ten billion digits examined in the case of {\\\\pi}. Within these\\nlimits, no evidence was found to suggest that the digits of these constants\\nsatisfy CLT or LIL.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:42:47Z\"}"}
