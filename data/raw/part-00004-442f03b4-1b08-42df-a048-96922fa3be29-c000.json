{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20649v1\", \"title\": \"Short-time quantum Fourier transform processing\", \"summary\": \"Algorithms for processing data in short-time batches are critical for both\\nonline and offline processing of streamed and large data respectively due to\\nthe quadratic relation between signal length and computational cost of\\nconvolution-based processing schemes. Whilst quantum analogs to some digital\\nsignal processing algorithms have been discovered, including the quantum\\nFourier transform (QFT), there has been no development of short-time processing\\ntechniques in the quantum domain. In this manuscript, we introduce the\\nshort-time QFT (STQFT) processing technique to bridge this gap in research. We\\ndevelop a novel overlap-add reconstruction technique in the quantum domain\\nusing a permutation gate to combine subsequent windows. With this in mind, we\\ndiscuss convolution under our novel STQFT processing scheme. We demonstrate\\nfiltering in the quantum Fourier domain with a filter stored in a quantum\\nregister as well as in a block encoded unitary gate. Throughout the paper, we\\nelaborate upon implementation details such as applying DC offsets to input\\nsignals, skipping input data frames whenever necessary, the use of overlap-save\\nas a reconstruction technique and mitigating time-varying scaling due to\\nnormalization of the windowed input data and filters.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T11:19:51Z\"}"}
