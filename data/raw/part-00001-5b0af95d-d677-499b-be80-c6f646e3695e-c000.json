In cosmetics, applications such as\\nhair conditioning typically rely on the adsorption of polyelectrolyte films\\nonto the charged surface of hair fibers, whose contact mechanics and\\ntribological properties are central in determining the final sensorial\\nperceptions associated with the cosmetic treatment. A major current challenge\\nto be tackled by the cosmetic industry is to design high-performance products\\nemploying bio-sourced polyelectrolytes, with the aim of achieving\\neco-sustainable processes and products. In this context, the present study\\nfocuses on the mechanical properties of thin films obtained by adsorption from\\nsolution of fungal chitosan onto negatively charged mica surfaces. We use a\\nSurface Forces Apparatus allowing for the simultaneous measurement of film\\nthickness and friction force as a function of the applied normal load and shear\\nvelocity. We show that, in aqueous medium at an ionic strength of 40 mM,\\nadsorbed films of chitosan give rise to repulsive inter-surface forces whose\\nrange, comparable to the Flory radius of the macromolecules, increases with the\\npolymer molecular weight. In addition, the adsorbed layers are found to behave,\\nunder compressive forces, as pseudo-brushes of neutral polymers. Finally, we\\nshow that under shear forces, chitosan layers exhibit a transition from a low\\nto a high friction regime under increasing confinement.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:57:56Z\"}"}
