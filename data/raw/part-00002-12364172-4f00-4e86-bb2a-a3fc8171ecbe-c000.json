{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10190v1\", \"title\": \"Differentially Private 2D Human Pose Estimation\", \"summary\": \"Human pose estimation (HPE) has become essential in numerous applications\\nincluding healthcare, activity recognition, and human-computer interaction.\\nHowever, the privacy implications of processing sensitive visual data present\\nsignificant deployment barriers in critical domains. While traditional\\nanonymization techniques offer limited protection and often compromise data\\nutility for broader motion analysis, Differential Privacy (DP) provides formal\\nprivacy guarantees but typically degrades model performance when applied\\nnaively. In this work, we present the first differentially private 2D human\\npose estimation (2D-HPE) by applying Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient\\nDescent (DP-SGD) to this task. To effectively balance privacy with performance,\\nwe adopt Projected DP-SGD (PDP-SGD), which projects the noisy gradients to a\\nlow-dimensional subspace. Additionally, we adapt TinyViT, a compact and\\nefficient vision transformer for coordinate classification in HPE, providing a\\nlightweight yet powerful backbone that enhances privacy-preserving deployment\\nfeasibility on resource-limited devices. Our approach is particularly valuable\\nfor multimedia interpretation tasks, enabling privacy-safe analysis and\\nunderstanding of human motion across diverse visual media while preserving the\\nsemantic meaning required for downstream applications. Comprehensive\\nexperiments on the MPII Human Pose Dataset demonstrate significant performance\\nenhancement with PDP-SGD achieving 78.48% PCKh@0.5 at a strict privacy budget\\n($\\\\epsilon=0.2$), compared to 63.85% for standard DP-SGD. This work lays\\nfoundation for privacy-preserving human pose estimation in real-world,\\nsensitive applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T12:50:37Z\"}"}
