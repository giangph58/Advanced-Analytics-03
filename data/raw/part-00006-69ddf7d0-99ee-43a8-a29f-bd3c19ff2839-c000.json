{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03305v1\", \"title\": \"Generalization of Bohmian Mechanics and Quantum Gravity Effective Action\", \"summary\": \"We generalize the de Broglie-Bohm (dBB) formulation of quantum mechanics to\\nthe case of quantum gravity (QG) by using the effective action for a QG theory.\\nThis is done by replacing the dBB equations of motion with the effective action\\nequations of motion, which is beneficial even in the non-gravitational case,\\nsince in this way one avoids the violations of the Heisenberg uncertainity\\nrelations and the absence of the classical trajectories for stationary bound\\nstates. Another advantage of the effective action formalism is that one can\\nobtain the field configurations in the case of a quantum field theory (QFT).\\nThe proposed QG generalization is natural for Bohmiam mechanics because a dBB\\nwavefunction is really a wavefunction of the Universe and in order to define\\nthe effective action for an arbitrary initial state one needs a QG path\\nintegral. The QG effective action can be constructed by using the piecewise\\nflat quantum gravity (PFQG) theory and the PFQG effective action can be\\napproximated by the QFT effective action for General Relativity coupled to\\nmatter, with a cutoff determined by the average edge length of the spacetime\\ntriangulation. One can then calculate the corresponding field configurations\\nand from these field configurations one can obtain the trajectories for the\\ncorresponding elementary particles.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:38:03Z\"}"}
