This process\\ncan be modeled by treating the dark matter as a gravothermal fluid, and solving\\nthe fluid equations to predict the density profile evolution. This model is\\nincomplete without calibration to N-body simulations, through a constant factor\\n$\\\\beta$ included in the thermal conductivity for the long-mean-free-path limit.\\nThe value of $\\\\beta$ employed in the gravothermal fluid formalism has varied\\nbetween studies, with no clear universal value in the literature. In this work,\\nwe use the N-body code Arepo to conduct a series of isolated core-collapse\\nsimulations across a range of scattering cross-sections, halo concentrations,\\nand halo masses to calibrate the heat transfer parameter $\\\\beta$. We find that\\n$\\\\beta$ is independent of cross-section, halo concentration, and halo mass for\\nvelocity independent elastic scattering cross-sections. We present a model for\\nan effective $\\\\beta$ as a function of a dimensionless cross-section, to\\ndescribe halo evolution in the long mean free path limit, and show that it\\naccurately captures halo evolution as long as the cross section is not too\\nlarge. This effective model facilitates comparisons between simulations and the\\ngravothermal model, and enables fast predictions of the dark matter density\\nprofile at any given time without running N-body simulations.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T15:14:35Z\"}"}
