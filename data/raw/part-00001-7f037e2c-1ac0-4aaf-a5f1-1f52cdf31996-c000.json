{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24158v1\", \"title\": \"Current status of real-time imaging of antiproton annihilation in\\n  biological targets\", \"summary\": \"Following a successful pioneering study of the biological effects of\\nantimatter ( the AD-4/ACE experiment at CERN), the use of antiprotons in\\nclinical radiotherapy became a very serious possibility. A major part of any\\nfuture radiotherapy using antiprotons will be real-time imaging of antiproton\\nannihilation in biological targets. In principle, real-time imaging is possible\\nthanks to the secondary particles, neutral pions and charger pions, produced by\\nthe annihilation of antiprotons in the cells they come to a stop in.Neutral\\npions decay dominantly and almost instantaneously into a photon pair, and one\\napproach to real-time imaging is based on the detection of these high-energy\\ngammas. An alternative is based on the detection of charged pions, which have\\nlifetimes almost a billion times longer than neutral pions. This paper is a\\nbrief review of this field of research, from the first real-time imaging\\nachieved by the AD-4/ACE experiment in 2004 to the present day.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.med-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.med-ph,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:42:01Z\"}"}
