{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20698v1\", \"title\": \"A High-Granularity Proton CT Enhanced by Track Discrimination\", \"summary\": \"Proton Computed Tomography (pCT) provides a promising solution to enhance the\\naccuracy of Relative Stopping Power (RSP) required for proton therapy planning.\\nThis research introduces a novel high-granularity pCT architecture that\\nincorporates a silicon pixel tracking system and a calorimetric range\\ntelescope, which uniquely integrates range telescope functionality with track\\ndiscrimination capabilities. The Bortfeld function fitting and Convolutional\\nNeural Network (CNN) classifier algorithms are developed and applied for\\ndiscrimination. In simulation studies, both approaches demonstrate the\\ncapability to reduce uncertainty in Water Equivalent Path Length (WEPL)\\ndetermination for individual proton tracks to below 3~mm. The standard imaging\\nprotocol (3.2~mGy, $4\\\\times10^{8}$ protons) achieves sub-millimeter spatial\\nresolution ($\\\\sim$0.5 mm) with sub-1\\\\% RSP accuracy. With proton count\\nrequirements reduced by track discrimination, an ultra-low-dose protocol\\n(0.16~mGy, $2\\\\times10^{7}$~protons) is proposed with achieved sub-1\\\\% RSP\\naccuracy and $\\\\sim$1.1~mm spatial resolution in simulation. This low-dose\\nperformance significantly expands clinical applicability, particularly for\\npediatric imaging or frequent imaging scenarios. Furthermore, the target 10 MHz\\nproton detection rate suggests potential for real-time image guidance during\\nradiotherapy. By circumventing the need for ultra-precise energy measurements,\\nthis design minimizes hardware complexity and provides a scalable foundation\\nfor future pCT systems.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.med-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.med-ph,physics.ins-det\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T12:29:12Z\"}"}
