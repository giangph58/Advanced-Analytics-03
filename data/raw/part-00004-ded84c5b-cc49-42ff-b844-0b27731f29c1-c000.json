Prior works have, however, used only naive approaches to the algorithm\\nselection problem, which can lead to significant overhead from trialling poorly\\nperforming algorithmic configurations.\\n  In this work, we investigate this problem in the case of Molecular Dynamics\\nsimulations. We present three algorithm selection strategies: an approach which\\nmakes performance predictions from past data, an expert-knowledge fuzzy\\nlogic-based approach, and a data-driven random forest-based approach. We\\ndemonstrate that these approaches can achieve speedups of up to 4.05 compared\\nto prior approaches and 1.25 compared to a perfect configuration selection\\nwithout dynamic algorithm selection. In addition, we discuss the practicality\\nof the strategies in comparison to their performance, to highlight the\\ntractability of such solutions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CE\", \"categories\": \"cs.CE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T11:24:07Z\"}"}
