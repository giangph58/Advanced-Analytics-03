{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21671v1\", \"title\": \"A Bespoke Design Approach to Low-Power Printed Microprocessors for\\n  Machine Learning Applications\", \"summary\": \"Printed electronics have gained significant traction in recent years,\\npresenting a viable path to integrating computing into everyday items, from\\ndisposable products to low-cost healthcare. However, the adoption of computing\\nin these domains is hindered by strict area and power constraints, limiting the\\neffectiveness of general-purpose microprocessors. This paper proposes a bespoke\\nmicroprocessor design approach to address these challenges, by tailoring the\\ndesign to specific applications and eliminating unnecessary logic. Targeting\\nmachine learning applications, we further optimize core operations by\\nintegrating a SIMD MAC unit supporting 4 precision configurations that boost\\nthe efficiency of microprocessors. Our evaluation across 6 ML models and the\\nlarge-scale Zero-Riscy core, shows that our methodology can achieve\\nimprovements of 22.2%, 23.6%, and 33.79% in area, power, and speed,\\nrespectively, without compromising accuracy. Against state-of-the-art printed\\nprocessors, our approach can still offer significant speedups, but along with\\nsome accuracy degradation. This work explores how such trade-offs can enable\\nlow-power printed microprocessors for diverse ML applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AR\", \"categories\": \"cs.AR\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T16:37:18Z\"}"}
