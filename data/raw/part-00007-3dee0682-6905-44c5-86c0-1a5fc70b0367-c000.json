Despite\\nlong-standing concerns, there are limited methods that can efficiently and\\naccurately detect and segment leaks due to their concealed appearance and\\nrandom shapes. In this paper, we propose a Fine-grained Spatial-Temporal\\nPerception (FGSTP) algorithm for gas leak segmentation. FGSTP captures critical\\nmotion clues across frames and integrates them with refined object features in\\nan end-to-end network. Specifically, we first construct a correlation volume to\\ncapture motion information between consecutive frames. Then, the fine-grained\\nperception progressively refines the object-level features using previous\\noutputs. Finally, a decoder is employed to optimize boundary segmentation.\\nBecause there is no highly precise labeled dataset for gas leak segmentation,\\nwe manually label a gas leak video dataset, GasVid. Experimental results on\\nGasVid demonstrate that our model excels in segmenting non-rigid objects such\\nas gas leaks, generating the most accurate mask compared to other\\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T04:35:57Z\"}"}
