{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21485v1\", \"title\": \"Monolayer C$_{60}$ networks: A first-principles perspective\", \"summary\": \"Monolayer fullerene (C$_{60}$) networks combine molecular-level rigidity with\\ncrystalline connectivity, offering a promising platform for numerous\\napplications. In this Feature article, we review the physical and chemical\\nproperties of fullerene monolayers, focusing on first-principles studies. We\\nfirst explore the structural stability of monolayer phases and investigate\\ntheir thermal expansion behaviours. We then outline criteria for photocatalytic\\nwater splitting and introduce theoretical predictions which are supported by\\nrecent experimental verification. Finally, we show how interlayer stacking,\\nmolecular size, and dimensional tuning (from 2D monolayers into 3D crystals, 1D\\nchains, or nanoribbons) offer versatile approaches to modulate their chemical\\nfunctionality. Together, these insights establish fullerene networks as a novel\\nclass of carbon-based materials with tailored properties for catalysis,\\nphotovoltaics, and flexible electronics.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.mes-hall,physics.app-ph,physics.atm-clus,physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T10:09:45Z\"}"}
