We then calculate the\\ngravitational waveforms generated by these periodic orbits, identifying\\npotential observational signatures. Our analysis reveals a direct connection\\nbetween the zoom-whirl orbital behavior of the small compact object and the\\ngravitational waveforms it emits: higher zoom numbers lead to increasingly\\nintricate waveform substructures. Moreover, the presence of the \\\\ae{}ther field\\nintroduces significant modifications to these waveforms, imprinting measurable\\ndeviations that could be potentially tested or constrained by future\\nspace-based gravitational wave detectors.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T04:34:03Z\"}"}
