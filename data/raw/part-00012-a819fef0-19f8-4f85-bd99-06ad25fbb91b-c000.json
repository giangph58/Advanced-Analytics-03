{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20434v1\", \"title\": \"ARCS: Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Code Synthesis with Iterative\\n  Refinement\", \"summary\": \"In supercomputing, efficient and optimized code generation is essential to\\nleverage high-performance systems effectively. We propose Agentic\\nRetrieval-Augmented Code Synthesis (ARCS), an advanced framework for accurate,\\nrobust, and efficient code generation, completion, and translation. ARCS\\nintegrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\\nreasoning to systematically break down and iteratively refine complex\\nprogramming tasks. An agent-based RAG mechanism retrieves relevant code\\nsnippets, while real-time execution feedback drives the synthesis of candidate\\nsolutions. This process is formalized as a state-action search tree\\noptimization, balancing code correctness with editing efficiency. Evaluations\\non the Geeks4Geeks and HumanEval benchmarks demonstrate that ARCS significantly\\noutperforms traditional prompting methods in translation and generation\\nquality. By enabling scalable and precise code synthesis, ARCS offers\\ntransformative potential for automating and optimizing code development in\\nsupercomputing applications, enhancing computational resource utilization.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T05:15:52Z\"}"}
