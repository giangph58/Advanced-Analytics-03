{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21524v1\", \"title\": \"Levitated Sensor for Magnetometry in Ambient Environment\", \"summary\": \"Levitated particle systems have gained significant attention as a rapidly\\nadvancing platform for precision sensing, offering low-loss, highly isolated\\nenvironments by eliminating mechanical contact and associated noise. Current\\nroom-temperature levitation techniques are primarily sensitive to acceleration,\\nwith magnetic sensing often relying on the Meissner effect, which is\\nimpractical under ambient conditions. Here, we demonstrate a diamagnetically\\nstabilized magnetically levitated magnet magnetometer (LeMaMa), where the\\nmotion of the magnet is detected optically. Leveraging strong spin-lattice\\ncoupling in the ferromagnet to suppress spin-projection noise and minimizing\\ndissipation through levitation, we achieve a sensitivity of 32 fT $/Hz^{1/2}$.\\nThis sensitivity is adequate for a wide range of applications in biology,\\nchemistry, and fundamental physics, matching the performance of leading\\ntechnologies like SQUIDs and atomic magnetometers, while offering the distinct\\nadvantage of operating at room temperature and under Earth's magnetic field.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T11:18:46Z\"}"}
