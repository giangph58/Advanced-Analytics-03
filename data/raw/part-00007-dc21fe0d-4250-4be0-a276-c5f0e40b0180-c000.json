However,\\nmost of the existing frameworks focus on the simplified scenario where\\nknowledge does not change over time and does not cover the temporal dimension.\\nIn this work we consider the much more challenging problem of knowledge-driven\\nsequence classification where different portions of knowledge must be employed\\nat different timesteps, and temporal relations are available. Our experimental\\nevaluation compares multi-stage neuro-symbolic and neural-only architectures,\\nand it is conducted on a newly-introduced benchmarking framework. Results\\ndemonstrate the challenging nature of this novel setting, and also highlight\\nunder-explored shortcomings of neuro-symbolic methods, representing a precious\\nreference for future research.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T10:10:00Z\"}"}
