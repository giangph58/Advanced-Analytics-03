Here, we demonstrate single-stage, multi-octave (~\\n2.4 octaves) spectral broadening of Yb:KGW amplified pulses in a\\nneon-pressurized hollow-core fiber (HCF) capillary and their compression to the\\nsingle-cycle regime (1.1 cycles at 880 nm) using chirped mirrors. Utilizing\\nHomochromatic Attosecond Streaking (HAS), we characterize the field waveforms\\nof the generated pulses and demonstrate precise control of their\\ncarrier-envelope phase. Our results provide a simplified route to single-cycle\\npulse generation using Yb:KGW technology, previously possible only with\\nTi:Sapphire-based front ends. This work paves the way for advanced applications\\nin attosecond science, strong-field physics, and spectroscopy.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T13:20:16Z\"}"}
