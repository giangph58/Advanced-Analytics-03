{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11359v1\", \"title\": \"Deciphering the Structure of Push-Pull Conjugated Polymer Aggregates in\\n  Solution and Film\", \"summary\": \"The morphology of conjugated polymer films is highly tunable, influencing\\ntheir performance in organic electronics. Specifically, molecular packing or\\ncrystal structure strongly influence electronic processes such as light\\nabsorption and charge transfer. However, the unit cells of high-performance\\nelectron donor polymers remain unknown, limiting the understanding of how\\nprocessing affects structure and device performance. This study characterizes\\nthe aggregate structure of PM6-type push-pull polymers using X-ray scattering,\\ncryogenic electron microscopy, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. A novel\\nforward simulation approach linking grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray\\nscattering (GIWAXS) with MD resolves a monoclinic unit cell that accurately\\ndescribes PM6-type polymer aggregates in both thin films and casting solutions.\\nIntimate pi-pi stacking between donor and acceptor units emerges from this unit\\ncell. Analysis of experimental GIWAXS using this unit cell quantifies sliding\\ndisorder in these aggregates, which may impact device performance. The shape\\nand internal structure of solution aggregates are also identified in\\nchlorobenzene. These findings enhance our understanding of PM6-type polymer\\npacking, outline a strategy for elucidating the crystal structure of weakly\\nordered materials, and provide an opportunity to control optoelectronic\\nperformance through aggregate formation in PM6 and other push-pull conjugated\\npolymers.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:26:28Z\"}"}
