{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12177v1\", \"title\": \"Mapping Controversies Using Artificial Intelligence: An Analysis of the\\n  Hamas-Israel Conflict on YouTube\", \"summary\": \"This article analyzes the Hamas-Israel controversy through 253,925\\nSpanish-language YouTube comments posted between October 2023 and January 2024,\\nfollowing the October 7 attack that escalated the conflict. Adopting an\\ninterdisciplinary approach, the study combines the analysis of controversies\\nfrom Science and Technology Studies (STS) with advanced computational\\nmethodologies, specifically Natural Language Processing (NLP) using the BERT\\n(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. Using this\\napproach, the comments were automatically classified into seven categories,\\nreflecting pro-Palestinian, pro-Israeli, anti- Palestinian, anti-Israeli\\npositions, among others. The results show a predominance of pro- Palestinian\\ncomments, although pro-Israeli and anti-Palestinian comments received more\\n\\\"likes.\\\" This study also applies the agenda-setting theory to demonstrate how\\nmedia coverage significantly influences public perception, observing a notable\\nshift in public opinion, transitioning from a pro- Palestinian stance to a more\\ncritical position towards Israel. This work highlights the importance of\\ncombining social science perspectives with technological tools in the analysis\\nof controversies, presenting a methodological innovation by integrating\\ncomputational analysis with critical social theories to address complex public\\nopinion phenomena and media narratives.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T15:27:57Z\"}"}
