We argue that a co-design approach offers significant advantages in\\nreplicating the complex dynamics of odor sensing and processing. We investigate\\na hybrid system of synthetic sensory neurons that provides three key features:\\na) receptor-gated ion channels, b) interface between synthetic biology and\\nsemiconductors and c) event-based encoding and computing based on spiking\\nnetworks. This research seeks to develop a platform for ultra-sensitive,\\nspecific, and energy-efficient odor detection, with potential implications for\\nenvironmental monitoring, medical diagnostics, and security.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NE\", \"categories\": \"cs.NE,cs.ET,q-bio.NC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:57:20Z\"}"}
