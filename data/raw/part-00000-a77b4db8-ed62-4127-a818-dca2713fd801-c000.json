When a large temperature difference of 405 $^\\\\circ$C\\nis applied to the SmCo$_5$/Bi$_{0.2}$Sb$_{1.8}$Te$_3$-based module, the\\nopen-circuit voltage and output power reach 0.51 V and 0.80 W, respectively,\\nwhere the corresponding maximum power density is 0.16 W/cm$^2$. The maximum\\nenergy conversion efficiency for our module in this condition is experimentally\\ndetermined to be 0.92%. Under the cooling operation, the same module exhibits\\nthe maximum temperature difference of 9.0 $^\\\\circ$C and heat flow at the cold\\nside of 1.6 W. Although these values are lower than the ideal thermoelectric\\nperformance expected from the material parameters due to the imperfections\\nassociated with modularization, the systematic investigations reported here\\nclarify a potential of the SmCo$_5$/Bi$_{0.2}$Sb$_{1.8}$Te$_3$ artificially\\ntilted multilayers as thermoelectric generators and cooling devices.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T16:08:12Z\"}"}
