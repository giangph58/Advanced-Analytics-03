We investigate how electronic\\nstrong coupling influences molecular vibrational properties, applying this\\nframework to formaldehyde, p-nitroaniline, and adamantane. Our analysis reveals\\ncavity-induced changes in vibrational frequencies and intensities.\\nAdditionally, we show how the quantum electromagnetic field breaks molecular\\nsymmetry, activating previously forbidden infrared transitions. Our findings\\nhighlight the potential of strong coupling as a method for controlling and\\nmodulating molecular vibrational properties.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T12:38:21Z\"}"}
