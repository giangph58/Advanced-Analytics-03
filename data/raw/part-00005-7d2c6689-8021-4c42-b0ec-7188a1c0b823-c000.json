{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17509v1\", \"title\": \"Magic state distillation without measurements and post-selection\", \"summary\": \"Magic state distillation (MSD) is a quantum algorithm that enables performing\\nlogical non-Clifford gates with in principle arbitrarily low noise level. It is\\nherein typically assumed that logical Clifford gates can be executed without\\nnoise. Therefore, MSD is a standard subroutine to obtain a fault-tolerant\\nuniversal set of quantum gate operations on error-corrected logical qubits.\\nWell-known schemes conventionally rely on performing operator measurements and\\npost-selection on the measurement result, which makes distillation protocols\\nnon-deterministic in the presence of noise. In this work, we adapt the 15-to-1\\nMSD protocol such that it deterministically suppresses noise by using a\\ncoherent feedback network on the output states without the need to perform\\nindividual qubit measurements. These advantages over textbook MSD come at the\\nprice of reducing the noise suppression per round from $\\\\mathcal{O}(p^3)$ to\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}(p^2)$. Our technique can be applied to any MSD protocol with an\\nacceptance rate of 1 in the absence of noise. It may be desirable to use our\\nscheme if the coherent feedback network can be executed faster and more\\nreliably than the measurements and/or if logical clock cycles in the quantum\\nprocessor should be kept synchronous at all times. Our result broadens the path\\nof potential experimental realizations of MSD in near-term devices and advances\\nthe development of fault-tolerant quantum computers with practical use.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T12:52:51Z\"}"}
