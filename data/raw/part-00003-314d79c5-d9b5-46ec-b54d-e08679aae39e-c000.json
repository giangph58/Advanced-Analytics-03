Exact and approximate solutions\", \"summary\": \"Within the tight-binding model taking into account the Coulomb repulsion of\\nelectrons at one site (the Hubbard model), an exact calculation of the Fourier\\ntransform of the anticommutator Green's function of the C2 dimer as a\\nstructural element of fullerene, the poles of which determine the energy\\nspectrum of the studied nanosystem, was performed. Graphic representations of\\nthe equation for the chemical potential and the density of state of electrons\\nwere obtained. A solution for the dimer was obtained within the approximation\\nof static fluctuations. The Fourier transform of the anticommutator Green's\\nfunction, obtained in the approximation of static fluctuations, coincided with\\na similar function obtained within the exact solution. The ionization energy\\nand electron affinity were calculated and found to be 11.87 eV and 3.39 eV,\\nrespectively. It was concluded that the method for solving the Hubbard model\\nfor the C2 dimer in the approximation of static fluctuations proposed in the\\nwork can be a fairly adequate method for theoretical study of strongly\\ncorrelated systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.mes-hall,physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T11:10:42Z\"}"}
