{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17488v1\", \"title\": \"Microscopic derivation of the stationary Chern-Simons-Schr\\u00f6dinger\\n  equation for almost-bosonic anyons\", \"summary\": \"In this work we consider the $N$-body Hamiltonian describing the microscopic\\nstructure of a quantum gas of almost-bosonic anyons. This description includes\\nboth extended magnetic flux and spin-orbit/soft-disk interaction between the\\nparticles which are confined in a scalar trapping potential. We study a\\nphysically well-motivated ansatz for a sequence of trial states, consisting of\\nJastrow repulsive short-range correlations and a condensate, with sufficient\\nvariational freedom to approximate the ground state (and possibly also\\nlow-energy excited states) of the gas. In the limit $N \\\\to \\\\infty$, while\\ntaking the relative size of the anyons to zero and the total magnetic flux\\n$2\\\\pi\\\\beta$ to remain finite, we rigorously derive the stationary\\nChern-Simons-Schr\\\\\\\"odinger/average-field-Pauli effective energy density\\nfunctional for the condensate wave function. This includes a scalar\\nself-interaction parameter $\\\\gamma$ which depends both on $\\\\beta$, the\\ndiluteness of the gas, and the spin-orbit coupling strength $g$, but becomes\\nindependent of these microscopic details for a particular value of the coupling\\n$g=2$ in which supersymmetry is exhibited (on all scales, both microscopic and\\nmesoscopic) with $\\\\gamma=2\\\\pi|\\\\beta|$. Our findings confirm and clarify the\\npredictions we have found in the physics literature.\", \"main_category\": \"math-ph\", \"categories\": \"math-ph,cond-mat.quant-gas,cond-mat.str-el,math.AP,math.MP,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T12:29:20Z\"}"}
