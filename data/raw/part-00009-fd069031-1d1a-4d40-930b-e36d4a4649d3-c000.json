{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21816v1\", \"title\": \"Enumeration of minimum weight codewords of affine Cartesian codes\", \"summary\": \"Affine Cartesian codes were first discussed by Geil and Thomsen in 2013 in a\\nbroader framework and were formally introduced by L\\\\'opez, Renter\\\\'ia-M\\\\'arquez\\nand Villarreal in 2014. These are linear error-correcting codes obtained by\\nevaluating polynomials at points of a Cartesian product of subsets of the given\\nfinite field. They can be viewed as a vast generalization of Reed-Muller codes.\\nIn 1970, Delsarte, Goethals and MacWilliams gave a %characterization of minimum\\nweight codewords of Reed-Muller codes and also formula for the minimum weight\\ncodewords of Reed-Muller codes. Carvalho and Neumann in 2020 considered affine\\nCartesian codes in a special setting where the subsets in the Cartesian product\\nare nested subfields of the given finite field, and gave a characterization of\\ntheir minimum weight codewords. We use this to give an explicit formula for the\\nnumber of minimum weight codewords of affine Cartesian codes in the case of\\nnested subfields. This is seen to unify the known formulas for the number of\\nminimum weight codewords of Reed-Solomon codes and Reed-Muller codes.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.CO,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:21:30Z\"}"}
