{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06959v1\", \"title\": \"Temporal dynamics of GHz acoustic waves in chipscale phononic integrated\\n  circuits\", \"summary\": \"Phononic integrated circuits, which manipulate GHz-frequency acoustic fields\\nin {\\\\mu}m-scale waveguides, provide new degrees of freedom for routing and\\nmanipulation of microwaves in deeply sub-wavelength geometries with associated\\nimplications for chipscale sensing and signal processing. The combination of\\nlow propagation loss, long interaction lengths and slow speed of sound put\\ntogether with the large measurement bandwidths and high frequency resolution\\navailable from modern vector network analyzers (VNA) makes it feasible to\\nvisualize the temporal dynamics of propagating acoustic fields in these devices\\nand see the device in action. Two representative examples we discuss here are\\npulse circulation and ringdown in an acoustic microring resonator, and the\\nobservation of (parasitic) multipath interference effects in waveguide\\nresonator geometries. In the absence of fast 3D acoustic field imaging\\nmodalities, such time domain reflectometry based methods provide the best\\nalternative for mapping interface reflection and loss, which becomes\\nincreasingly critical as these devices start to scale in complexity.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.app-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T15:09:58Z\"}"}
