{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05156v1\", \"title\": \"Regression-based Melody Estimation with Uncertainty Quantification\", \"summary\": \"Existing machine learning models approach the task of melody estimation from\\npolyphonic audio as a classification problem by discretizing the pitch values,\\nwhich results in the loss of finer frequency variations present in the melody.\\nTo better capture these variations, we propose to approach this task as a\\nregression problem. Apart from predicting only the pitch for a particular\\nregion in the audio, we also predict its uncertainty to enhance the\\ntrustworthiness of the model. To perform regression-based melody estimation, we\\npropose three different methods that use histogram representation to model the\\npitch values. Such a representation requires the support range of the histogram\\nto be continuous. The first two methods address the abrupt discontinuity\\nbetween unvoiced and voiced frequency ranges by mapping them to a continuous\\nrange. The third method reformulates melody estimation as a fully Bayesian\\ntask, modeling voicing detection as a classification problem, and voiced pitch\\nestimation as a regression problem. Additionally, we introduce a novel method\\nto estimate the uncertainty from the histogram representation that correlates\\nwell with the deviation of the mean of the predicted distribution from the\\nground truth. Experimental results demonstrate that reformulating melody\\nestimation as a regression problem significantly improves the performance over\\nclassification-based approaches. Comparing the proposed methods with a\\nstate-of-the-art regression model, it is observed that the Bayesian method\\nperforms the best at estimating both the melody and its associated uncertainty.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.AS\", \"categories\": \"eess.AS\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T11:51:46Z\"}"}
