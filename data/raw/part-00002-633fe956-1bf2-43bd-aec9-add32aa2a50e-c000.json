{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12621v1\", \"title\": \"Revisiting multifunctionality in reservoir computing\", \"summary\": \"Multifunctionality is ubiquitous in biological neurons. Several studies have\\ntranslated the concept to artificial neural networks as well. Recently,\\nmultifunctionality in reservoir computing (RC) has gained the widespread\\nattention of researchers. Multistable dynamics of the reservoir can be\\nconfigured to capture multiple tasks, each by one of the co-existing\\nattractors. However, there are several limitations in the applicability of this\\napproach. So far, multifunctional RC has been shown to be able to reconstruct\\ndifferent attractor climates only when the attractors are well separated in the\\nphase space. We propose a more flexible reservoir computing scheme capable of\\nmultifunctioning beyond the earlier limitations. The proposed architecture\\nholds striking similarity with the multifunctional biological neural networks\\nand showcases superior performance. It is capable of learning multiple chaotic\\nattractors with overlapping phase space. We successfully train the RC to\\nachieve multifunctionality with wide range of tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.CD\", \"categories\": \"nlin.CD\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T03:54:08Z\"}"}
