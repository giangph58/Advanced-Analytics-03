However, complex agents are typically developed in an\\nembedded manner, directly accessing game state information, unlike human\\nplayers who rely on noisy visual data, leading to unfair competition.\\nDeveloping complex non-embedded agents remains challenging, especially in\\ncard-based RTS games with complex features and large state spaces. We propose a\\nnon-embedded offline reinforcement learning training strategy using visual\\ninputs to achieve real-time autonomous gameplay in the RTS game Clash Royale.\\nDue to the lack of a object detection dataset for this game, we designed an\\nefficient generative object detection dataset for training. We extract features\\nusing state-of-the-art object detection and optical character recognition\\nmodels. Our method enables real-time image acquisition, perception feature\\nfusion, decision-making, and control on mobile devices, successfully defeating\\nbuilt-in AI opponents.
