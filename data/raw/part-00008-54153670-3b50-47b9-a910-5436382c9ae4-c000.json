While polarity is traditionally associated with\\nbiochemical patterning, the morphological aspect of axis formation remains\\nelusive. In regenerating Hydra tissues, we find that morphological evolution in\\nall tissue samples depends on inherited positional information from the donor\\naxis, and a foot precursor emerges early in the process. The Ca excitations\\nthat drive actomyosin forces for tissue reshaping follow a polarity-aligned\\ngradient from the onset of regeneration. We conclude that polarity and\\nmorphological axis progression occur concurrently through interlinked\\nprocesses, and that the foot plays a dominant role in this process, a role\\nusually attributed to the head organizer. These insights from Hydra likely\\nextend to broader developmental systems.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.bio-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.bio-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T10:12:44Z\"}"}
