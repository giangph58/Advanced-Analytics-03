{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10330v1\", \"title\": \"Can genomic analysis actually estimate past population size?\", \"summary\": \"Genomic data can be used to reconstruct population size over thousands of\\ngenerations, using a new class of algorithms (SMC methods). These analyses\\noften show a recent decline in $N_e$ (effective size), which at face value\\nimplies a conservation or demographic crisis: a population crash and loss of\\ngenetic diversity. This interpretation is frequently mistaken. Here we outline\\nhow SMC methods work, why they generate this misleading signal, and suggest\\nsimple approaches for exploiting the rich information produced by these\\nalgorithms. In most species, genomic patterns reflect major changes in the\\nspecies' range and subdivision over tens or hundreds of thousands of years.\\nConsequently, collaboration between geneticists, palaeoecologists,\\npalaeoclimatologists, and geologists is crucial for evaluating the outputs of\\nSMC algorithms.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.PE\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.PE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T15:37:55Z\"}"}
