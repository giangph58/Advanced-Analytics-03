{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03726v1\", \"title\": \"Anomalous proximity effect under Andreev and Majorana bound states\", \"summary\": \"We theoretically study the anomalous proximity effect in a ballistic normal\\nmetal/diffusive normal metal/superconductor junction based on Rashba\\nsemiconductor nanowire model. The system hosts two distinct phases: a trivial\\nhelical phase with zero-energy Andreev Bound States and a topological phase\\nwith Majorana Bound States. We analyze the local density of states and induced\\npair correlations at the edge of the normal metal region. We investigate their\\nbehavior under scalar onsite disorder and changing the Superconductor and\\ndiffusive regions lengths in the trivial helical and topological phases. We\\nfind that both phases exhibit a zero-energy peak in the local density of states\\nand spin-triplet pair correlations in the clean limit, which we attribute\\nprimarily to odd-frequency spin-triplet pairs. Disorder rapidly splits the\\nzero-energy peak in the trivial helical phase regardless of the lengths of the\\nsuperconductor and diffusive normal regions. The zero-energy peak in the\\ntopological phase show similar fragility when the superconductor region is\\nshort. However, for long superconductor regions, the zero-energy peak in the\\ntopological phase remain robust against disorder. In contrast, spin-singlet\\ncorrelations are suppressed near zero energy in both phases. Our results\\nhighlight that the robustness of the zero-energy peak against scalar disorder,\\ncontingent on the Superconductor region length, serves as a key indicator\\ndistinguishing trivial Andreev bound states from topological Majorana bound\\nstates.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T17:53:52Z\"}"}
