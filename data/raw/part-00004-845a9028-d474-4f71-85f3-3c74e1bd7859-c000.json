{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07465v1\", \"title\": \"Multi-Modal Data Fusion for Moisture Content Prediction in Apple Drying\", \"summary\": \"Fruit drying is widely used in food manufacturing to reduce product moisture,\\nensure product safety, and extend product shelf life. Accurately predicting\\nfinal moisture content (MC) is critically needed for quality control of drying\\nprocesses. State-of-the-art methods can build deterministic relationships\\nbetween process parameters and MC, but cannot adequately account for inherent\\nprocess variabilities that are ubiquitous in fruit drying. To address this gap,\\nthis paper presents a novel multi-modal data fusion framework to effectively\\nfuse two modalities of data: tabular data (process parameters) and\\nhigh-dimensional image data (images of dried apple slices) to enable accurate\\nMC prediction. The proposed modeling architecture permits flexible adjustment\\nof information portion from tabular and image data modalities. Experimental\\nvalidation shows that the multi-modal approach improves predictive accuracy\\nsubstantially compared to state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method reduces\\nroot-mean-squared errors by 19.3%, 24.2%, and 15.2% over tabular-only,\\nimage-only, and standard tabular-image fusion models, respectively.\\nFurthermore, it is demonstrated that our method is robust in varied\\ntabular-image ratios and capable of effectively capturing inherent small-scale\\nprocess variabilities. The proposed framework is extensible to a variety of\\nother drying technologies.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T05:29:04Z\"}"}
