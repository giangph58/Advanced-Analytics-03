{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04412v1\", \"title\": \"Latent Manifold Reconstruction and Representation with Topological and\\n  Geometrical Regularization\", \"summary\": \"Manifold learning aims to discover and represent low-dimensional structures\\nunderlying high-dimensional data while preserving critical topological and\\ngeometric properties. Existing methods often fail to capture local details with\\nglobal topological integrity from noisy data or construct a balanced\\ndimensionality reduction, resulting in distorted or fractured embeddings. We\\npresent an AutoEncoder-based method that integrates a manifold reconstruction\\nlayer, which uncovers latent manifold structures from noisy point clouds, and\\nfurther provides regularizations on topological and geometric properties during\\ndimensionality reduction, whereas the two components promote each other during\\ntraining. Experiments on point cloud datasets demonstrate that our method\\noutperforms baselines like t-SNE, UMAP, and Topological AutoEncoders in\\ndiscovering manifold structures from noisy data and preserving them through\\ndimensionality reduction, as validated by visualization and quantitative\\nmetrics. This work demonstrates the significance of combining manifold\\nreconstruction with manifold learning to achieve reliable representation of the\\nlatent manifold, particularly when dealing with noisy real-world data.
