{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10870v1\", \"title\": \"Algorithmic Advances Towards a Realizable Quantum Lattice Boltzmann\\n  Method\", \"summary\": \"The Quantum Lattice Boltzmann Method (QLBM) is one of the most promising\\napproaches for realizing the potential of quantum computing in simulating\\ncomputational fluid dynamics. Many recent works mostly focus on classical\\nsimulation, and rely on full state tomography. Several key algorithmic issues\\nlike observable readout, data encoding, and impractical circuit depth remain\\nunsolved. As a result, these are not directly realizable on any quantum\\nhardware. We present a series of novel algorithmic advances which allow us to\\nimplement the QLBM algorithm, for the first time, on a quantum computer.\\nHardware results for the time evolution of a 2D Gaussian initial density\\ndistribution subject to a uniform advection-diffusion field are presented.\\nFurthermore, 3D simulation results are presented for particular non-uniform\\nadvection fields, devised so as to avoid the problem of diminishing probability\\nof success due to repeated post-selection operations required for multiple\\ntimesteps. We demonstrate the evolution of an initial quantum state governed by\\nthe advection-diffusion equation, accounting for the iterative nature of the\\nexplicit QLBM algorithm. A tensor network encoding scheme is used to represent\\nthe initial condition supplied to the advection-diffusion equation,\\nsignificantly reducing the two-qubit gate count affording a shorter circuit\\ndepth. Further reductions are made in the collision and streaming operators.\\nCollectively, these advances give a path to realizing more practical, 2D and 3D\\nQLBM applications with non-trivial velocity fields on quantum hardware.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T05:02:41Z\"}"}
