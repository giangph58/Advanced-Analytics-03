By analyzing unstable timelike and null circular geodesics, we\\ndemonstrate that their Lyapunov exponents reflect the thermodynamic phase\\nstructure obtained from the Euclidean action. Specifically, the small-large\\nblack hole phase transition, analogous to a van der Waals fluid, is signaled by\\na discontinuity in the Lyapunov exponent. Treating this discontinuity as an\\norder parameter, we observe a universal critical exponent of $1/2$, consistent\\nwith mean-field theory. These results extend previous insights from black hole\\nspacetimes with Abelian charges to scenarios involving nonlinear, non-Abelian\\ngauge fields, highlighting the interplay between black hole thermodynamics and\\nchaotic dynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T12:31:32Z\"}"}
