{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10372v1\", \"title\": \"Simple physical systems as a reference for multivariate information\\n  dynamics\", \"summary\": \"Understanding a complex system entails capturing the non-trivial collective\\nphenomena that arise from interactions between its different parts. Information\\ntheory is a flexible and robust framework to study such behaviours, with\\nseveral measures designed to quantify and characterise the interdependencies\\namong the system's components. However, since these estimators rely on the\\nstatistical distributions of observed quantities, it is crucial to examine the\\nrelationships between information-theoretic measures and the system's\\nunderlying mechanistic structure. To this end, here we present an\\ninformation-theoretic analytical investigation of an elementary system of\\ninteractive random walkers subject to Gaussian noise. Focusing on partial\\ninformation decomposition, causal emergence, and integrated information, our\\nresults help us develop some intuitions on their relationship with the physical\\nparameters of the system. For instance, we observe that uncoupled systems can\\nexhibit emergent properties, in a way that we suggest may be better described\\nas ''statistically autonomous''. Overall, we observe that in this simple\\nscenario information measures align more reliably with the system's mechanistic\\nproperties when calculated at the level of microscopic components, rather than\\ntheir coarse-grained counterparts, and over timescales comparable with the\\nsystem's intrinsic dynamics. Moreover, we show that approaches that separate\\nthe contributions of the system's dynamics and steady-state distribution (e.g.\\nvia causal perturbations) may help strengthen the interpretation of\\ninformation-theoretic analyses.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:20:48Z\"}"}
