We propose a digital-twin imaging method based on\\nGaussian splatting to observe an object behind a scattering medium. A digital\\ntwin model built through data assimilation, emulates the behavior of objects\\nand environmental changes in a virtual space. By constructing a digital twin\\nusing point clouds composed of Gaussians and simulating the scattering process\\nthrough the convolution of a point spread function, three-dimensional objects\\nbehind a scattering medium can be reproduced as a digital twin. In this study,\\na high-contrast digital twin reproducing a three-dimensional object was\\nsuccessfully constructed from degraded images, assuming that data were acquired\\nfrom wavefronts disturbed by a scattering medium. This technique reproduces\\nobjects by integrating data processing with image measurements.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T05:02:11Z\"}"}
