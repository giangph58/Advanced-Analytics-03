Unconditional generation with\\ndiffusion models demonstrates limited efficacy in identifying symmetric\\ncrystals as the unit cell size increases. CHGGen addresses this limitation\\nthrough conditional generation with the inpainting method, which optimizes a\\nfraction of atomic positions within a predefined and symmetrized host\\nstructure. We demonstrate the method on the ZnS-P$_2$S$_5$ and Li-Si chemical\\nsystems, where the inpainting method generates a higher fraction of symmetric\\nstructures than unconditional generation. The practical significance of CHGGen\\nextends to enabling the structural modification of crystal structures,\\nparticularly for systems with partial occupancy, surface absorption and\\ndefects. The inpainting method also allows for seamless integration with other\\ngenerative models, providing a versatile framework for accelerating materials\\ndiscovery.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T17:21:03Z\"}"}
