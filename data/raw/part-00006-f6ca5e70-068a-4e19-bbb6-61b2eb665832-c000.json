If true,\\nthis statement would imply a well-known conjecture of Ryser from 1971, which\\nstates that every $r$-partite, $r$-uniform hypergraph has a vertex cover of\\nsize at most $r-1$ times its matching number. When $r=2$, Ryser's conjecture is\\nsimply K\\\\H{o}nig's theorem, and the conjecture of Lov\\\\'asz is an immediate\\ncorollary. Ryser's conjecture for $r=3$ was proven by Aharoni in 2001, and\\nremains open for all $r\\\\geq 4$.\\n  Here we show that the conjecture of Lov\\\\'asz is false in the case $r=3$. Our\\ncounterexample is the line hypergraph of the Biggs-Smith graph, a highly\\nsymmetric cubic graph on 102 vertices.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:28:47Z\"}"}
