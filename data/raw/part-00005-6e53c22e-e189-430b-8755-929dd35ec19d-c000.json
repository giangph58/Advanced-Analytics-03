{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05401v1\", \"title\": \"Efficient Numerical Quantification of Flettner Rotor Installations\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces an inviscid Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach\\nfor the rapid aerodynamic assessment of Flettner rotor systems on ships. The\\nmethod relies on the Eulerian flow equations, approximated utilizing a\\nstate-of-the-art Finite Volume Method with a dynamic momentum source term to\\nenforce rotor circulation. The method offers substantial computational savings\\nby avoiding near-wall refinement and easing time step constraints, making it\\nideal for early design phases such as design space exploration. Validation\\nagainst potential flow theory and viscous reference simulations confirms that\\nthe method reliably predicts lift-induced forces despite its limitations in\\ncapturing parasitic drag. Three-dimensional simulations, including idealized\\nwind tunnel setups and full-scale ship applications at high Reynolds numbers\\n(up to ReL=1E08), demonstrate that results based on low-order convection\\nfeaturing a solid numerical viscosity yield deviations with respect to viscous\\nreference data of around O(10%). Accepting this reasonable loss of predictive\\naccuracy provides a simulation framework with response times in the order of\\nminutes compared to hours or even days.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T16:38:48Z\"}"}
