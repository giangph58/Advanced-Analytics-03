They conjecture that these graphs are permutation representation graphs\\nof string C-groups. In trying to prove this conjecture, we discovered two new\\ntechniques to glue two CPR graphs for symmetric groups together. We discuss the\\ncases in which they yield new CPR graphs. By doing so, we invalidate the\\nconjecture of Cameron et al. We believe our gluing techniques will be useful in\\nthe study of string C-group representations of high ranks for the symmetric\\ngroups.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,math.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T13:24:12Z\"}"}
