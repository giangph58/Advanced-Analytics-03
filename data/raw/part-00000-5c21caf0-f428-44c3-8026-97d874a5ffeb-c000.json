Using\\nhigh-fidelity optical readout and long spin coherence time, we probe correlated\\nMHz-range noise with sensitivity of 15 nT Hz$^{-1/4}$. In addition, we use this\\nsystem for correlated $T_1$ relaxometry, enabling correlation measurements of\\nGHz-range noise. Under such externally applied noise, while individual NV\\ncenters exhibit featureless relaxation, their correlation displays rich\\ncoherent and incoherent dynamics reminiscent of superradiance physics. This\\ncapability to probe high-frequency correlations provides a powerful tool for\\ninvestigating a variety of condensed-matter phenomena characterized by nonlocal\\ncorrelations.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T03:01:48Z\"}"}
