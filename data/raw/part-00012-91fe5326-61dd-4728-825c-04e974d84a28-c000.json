{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20557v1\", \"title\": \"SNR-aware Semantic Image Transmission with Deep Learning-based Channel\\n  Estimation in Fading Channels\", \"summary\": \"Semantic communications (SCs) play a central role in shaping the future of\\nthe sixth generation (6G) wireless systems, which leverage rapid advances in\\ndeep learning (DL). In this regard, end-to-end optimized DL-based joint\\nsource-channel coding (JSCC) has been adopted to achieve SCs, particularly in\\nimage transmission. Utilizing vision transformers in the encoder/decoder design\\nhas enabled significant advancements in image semantic extraction, surpassing\\ntraditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this paper, we propose a\\nnew JSCC paradigm for image transmission, namely Swin semantic image\\ntransmission (SwinSIT), based on the Swin transformer. The Swin transformer is\\nemployed to construct both the semantic encoder and decoder for efficient image\\nsemantic extraction and reconstruction. Inspired by the\\nsqueezing-and-excitation (SE) network, we introduce a signal-to-noise-ratio\\n(SNR)-aware module that utilizes SNR feedback to adaptively perform a\\ndouble-phase enhancement for the encoder-extracted semantic map and its noisy\\nversion at the decoder. Additionally, a CNN-based channel estimator and\\ncompensator (CEAC) module repurposes an image-denoising CNN to mitigate fading\\nchannel effects. To optimize deployment in resource-constrained IoT devices, a\\njoint pruning and quantization scheme compresses the SwinSIT model. Simulations\\nevaluate the SwinSIT performance against conventional benchmarks demonstrating\\nits effectiveness. Moreover, the model's compressed version substantially\\nreduces its size while maintaining favorable PSNR performance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T08:57:47Z\"}"}
