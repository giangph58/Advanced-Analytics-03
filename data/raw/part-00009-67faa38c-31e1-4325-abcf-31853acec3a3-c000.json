{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11400v1\", \"title\": \"FlowUnits: Extending Dataflow for the Edge-to-Cloud Computing Continuum\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces FlowUnits, a novel programming and deployment model\\nthat extends the traditional dataflow paradigm to address the unique challenges\\nof edge-to-cloud computing environments. While conventional dataflow systems\\noffer significant advantages for large-scale data processing in homogeneous\\ncloud settings, they fall short when deployed across distributed, heterogeneous\\ninfrastructures. FlowUnits addresses three critical limitations of current\\napproaches: lack of locality awareness, insufficient resource adaptation, and\\nabsence of dynamic update mechanisms. FlowUnits organize processing operators\\ninto cohesive, independently manageable components that can be transparently\\nreplicated across different regions, efficiently allocated on nodes with\\nappropriate hardware capabilities, and dynamically updated without disrupting\\nongoing computations. We implement and evaluate the FlowUnits model within\\nRenoir, an existing dataflow system, demonstrating significant improvements in\\ndeployment flexibility and resource utilization across the computing continuum.\\nOur approach maintains the simplicity of dataflow while enabling seamless\\nintegration of edge and cloud resources into unified data processing pipelines.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC,cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T17:14:08Z\"}"}
