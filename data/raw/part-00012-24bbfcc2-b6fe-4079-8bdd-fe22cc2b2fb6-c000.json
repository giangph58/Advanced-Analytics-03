We introduce ImaginateAR, a mobile\\nAI-assisted AR authoring system that aims to let anyone build anything,\\nanywhere -- simply by speaking their imagination. ImaginateAR is powered by\\ncustom pipelines for offline scene understanding, fast 3D asset generation, and\\nLLM-driven speech interaction. Users might say \\\"a dragon enjoying a campfire\\\"\\n(P7) and iteratively refine the scene using both AI and manual tools. Our\\ntechnical evaluation shows that ImaginateAR produces more accurate outdoor\\nscene graphs and generates 3D meshes faster than prior methods. A three-part\\nuser study (N=20) revealed preferred roles for AI in authoring, what and how\\nusers create in free-form use, and design implications for future AR authoring\\ntools.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T06:44:14Z\"}"}
