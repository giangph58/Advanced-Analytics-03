{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03291v1\", \"title\": \"Simultaneous All-Pay Auctions with Budget Constraints\", \"summary\": \"The all-pay auction, a classic competitive model, is widely applied in\\nscenarios such as political elections, sports competitions, and research and\\ndevelopment, where all participants pay their bids regardless of winning or\\nlosing. However, in the traditional all-pay auction, players have no budget\\nconstraints, whereas in real-world scenarios, players typically face budget\\nconstraints. This paper studies the Nash equilibrium of two players with budget\\nconstraints across multiple heterogeneous items in a complete-information\\nframework. The main contributions are as follows: (1) a comprehensive\\ncharacterization of the Nash equilibrium in single-item auctions with\\nasymmetric budgets and valuations; (2) the construction of a joint distribution\\nNash equilibrium for the two-item scenario; and (3) the construction of a joint\\ndistribution Nash equilibrium for the three-item scenario. Unlike the\\nunconstrained all-pay auction, which always has a Nash equilibrium, a Nash\\nequilibrium may not exist when players have budget constraints. Our findings\\nhighlight the intricate effects of budget constraints on bidding strategies,\\nproviding new perspectives and methodologies for theoretical analysis and\\npractical applications of all-pay auctions.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.TH\", \"categories\": \"econ.TH,cs.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:16:48Z\"}"}
