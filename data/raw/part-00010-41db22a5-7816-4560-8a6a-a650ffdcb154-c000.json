{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13075v1\", \"title\": \"An All-Atom Generative Model for Designing Protein Complexes\", \"summary\": \"Proteins typically exist in complexes, interacting with other proteins or\\nbiomolecules to perform their specific biological roles. Research on\\nsingle-chain protein modeling has been extensively and deeply explored, with\\nadvancements seen in models like the series of ESM and AlphaFold. Despite these\\ndevelopments, the study and modeling of multi-chain proteins remain largely\\nuncharted, though they are vital for understanding biological functions.\\nRecognizing the importance of these interactions, we introduce APM (All-Atom\\nProtein Generative Model), a model specifically designed for modeling\\nmulti-chain proteins. By integrating atom-level information and leveraging data\\non multi-chain proteins, APM is capable of precisely modeling inter-chain\\ninteractions and designing protein complexes with binding capabilities from\\nscratch. It also performs folding and inverse-folding tasks for multi-chain\\nproteins. Moreover, APM demonstrates versatility in downstream applications: it\\nachieves enhanced performance through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) while also\\nsupporting zero-shot sampling in certain tasks, achieving state-of-the-art\\nresults. Code will be released at https://github.com/bytedance/apm.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T16:37:41Z\"}"}
