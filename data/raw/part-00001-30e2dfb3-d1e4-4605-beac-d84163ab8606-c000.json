We\\ndemonstrate that their kinematic spaces are equivalent to symplectic\\nGrassmannians SpGr(n,2n). For the three-point case, we express the amplitude as\\nan integral over the symplectic Grassmannian in a specific little group frame.\\nIn the four-point case, we show that the integral yields the amplitude up to a\\nknown kinematic factor. Building on the four-dimensional analysis, we also\\nexpress the six-dimensional N = (1,1) SYM amplitude in terms of\\nfour-dimensional variables in a form that makes its symplectic Grassmannian\\nstructure manifest.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T17:25:46Z\"}"}
