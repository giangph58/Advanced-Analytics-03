In this paper, we address this problem in the context of toric ideals\\nof graphs. We say that a graph $G$ is an MG-graph if its toric ideal $I_G$ is\\nminimally generated by some Gr\\\\\\\"obner basis, and a UMG-graph if every reduced\\nGr\\\\\\\"obner basis of $I_G$ forms a minimal generating set. We prove that a graph\\n$G$ is a UMG-graph if and only if its toric ideal $I_G$ is a generalized robust\\nideal (that is, its universal Gr\\\\\\\"obner basis coincides with its universal\\nMarkov basis). Although the class of MG-graphs is not closed under taking\\nsubgraphs, we prove that it is hereditary, that is, closed under taking induced\\nsubgraphs. In addition, we describe two families of bipartite MG-graphs: ring\\ngraphs (which correspond to complete intersection toric ideals, as shown by\\nGitler, Reyes, and Villarreal) and graphs in which all chordless cycles have\\nthe same length. The latter extends a result of Ohsugi and Hibi, which\\ncorresponds to graphs whose chordless cycles are all of length $4$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AC\", \"categories\": \"math.AC,math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T17:03:24Z\"}"}
