In this work, we study four\\n03fg-like SNe Ia using Swift UltraViolet and Optical Telescope (UVOT) grism\\nobservations to understand their unique UV properties and progenitor\\nscenario(s). We report 03fg-like SNe Ia to have similar UV features and\\nelemental compositions as normal SNe Ia, but with higher UV flux relative to\\noptical. Previous studies have suggested that the UV flux levels of normal SNe\\nIa could be influenced by their progenitor properties, such as metallicity,\\nwith metal-poor progenitors producing higher UV flux levels. While 03fg-like\\nSNe were previously reported to occur in low-mass and metal-poor host\\nenvironments, our analysis indicates that their UV excess cannot be explained\\nby their host-galaxy parameters. Instead, we demonstrate that the addition of a\\nhot blackbody component, likely arising from the interaction with the\\ncircumstellar material (CSM), to the normal SN Ia spectrum, can reproduce their\\ndistinctive UV excess. This supports the hypothesis that 03fg-like SNe Ia could\\nexplode in a CSM-rich environment.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:52:56Z\"}"}
