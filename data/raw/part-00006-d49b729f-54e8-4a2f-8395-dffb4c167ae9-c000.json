However, studies on the\\nimmediate effects of maternal hypoxia on fetal heart rate (FHR) changes are\\nlacking. Methods: We used time-synchronized polysomnography (PSG) and\\ncardiotocography (CTG) data from two cohorts to analyze the correlation between\\nmaternal hypoxia and FHR changes (accelerations or decelerations). Maternal\\nhypoxic event characteristics were analyzed using generalized linear modeling\\n(GLM) to assess their associations with different FHR changes. Results: A total\\nof 118 pregnant women participated. FHR changes were significantly associated\\nwith maternal hypoxia, primarily characterized by accelerations. A longer\\nhypoxic duration correlated with more significant FHR accelerations (P < 0.05),\\nwhile prolonged hypoxia and greater SpO2 drop were linked to FHR decelerations\\n(P < 0.05). Both cohorts showed a transient increase in FHR during maternal\\nhypoxia, which returned to baseline after the event resolved. Conclusion:\\nMaternal hypoxia significantly affects FHR, suggesting that maternal OSAS may\\ncontribute to fetal hypoxia. These findings highlight the importance of\\nmaternal-fetal interactions and provide insights for future interventions.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T15:17:14Z\"}"}
