{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06682v1\", \"title\": \"Bridging Research and Standardization: Innovations and Methodology for\\n  6G Standard Contributions\", \"summary\": \"The transition towards 6G presents unique challenges and opportunities in\\nmobile networks design and standardization. Addressing these challenges\\nrequires a robust methodology for analyzing and selecting innovations that can\\nbe effectively translated into 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)\\ncontributions. This paper presents a systematic approach to bridging research\\nand standardization, ensuring that cutting-edge advancements extend beyond\\nacademia and translate into concrete standardization efforts. The proposed\\nmethodology has been applied within the Italian RESTART framework to two\\nongoing research areas: Morphable Programmable Networks (MPNs) and Network\\nDigital Twins (NDTs), both key enablers of next-generation networks. MPNs\\nenhance dynamic adaptability and resource management, while NDTs enable\\nreal-time simulation, predictive analytics, and intelligent decision-making.\\nTheir integration into 3GPP Release 20 will be instrumental in shaping a\\nflexible and future-proof mobile ecosystem. These innovations exemplify how\\nresearch-driven solutions can align with 6G standardization objectives. By\\napplying the proposed methodology, we aim to establish a systematic pathway for\\ntransitioning research into impactful 3GPP contributions, ultimately driving\\nthe evolution of next-generation networks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI,cs.ET\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T08:39:38Z\"}"}
