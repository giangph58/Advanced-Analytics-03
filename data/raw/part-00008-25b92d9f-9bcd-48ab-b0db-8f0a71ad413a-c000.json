In this work, we develop\\na general approach of forward-backward splitting methods for solving monotone\\ninclusion problems involving both set-valued and single-valued operators, where\\nthe latter may lack cocoercivity. Our proposed approach, based on some\\ncoefficient matrices, not only encompasses several important existing\\nalgorithms but also extends to new ones, offering greater flexibility for\\ndifferent applications. Moreover, by appropriately selecting the coefficient\\nmatrices, the resulting algorithms can be implemented in a distributed and\\ndecentralized manner.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T09:30:21Z\"}"}
