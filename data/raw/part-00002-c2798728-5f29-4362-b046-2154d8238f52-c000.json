We derive exact formulas for the\\nthermoelectric conductivity and thermal conductivity in the limit of small\\nrelaxation rates for Bloch electrons in terms of Bloch wave functions, which\\nshow that the Sommerfeld-Bethe relationship holds. Our final formula contains\\nthe Berry curvature contributions as well as the orbital magnetic moment\\ncontributions, that arise naturally from the microscopic theory. We show that\\ngeneralized $f$-sum rules containing the Berry curvature and orbital magnetic\\nmoment play essential roles in taking into account the interband effects of the\\nmagnetic field. As an application, we study a model of a gapped Dirac electron\\nsystem with broken time-reversal symmetry and show the presence of a linear\\nmagnetothermopower in such systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T12:13:35Z\"}"}
