We establish an identity\\nrelating the subcritical and critical Hardy inequalities, thereby demonstrating\\ntheir equivalence. Moreover, we obtain improved versions of these inequalities\\nvia an analysis of extremizer stability. In the higher-order setting, we derive\\nHardy-Rellich type inequalities involving all radial operators in the Grushin\\nframework and prove that all resulting constants are sharp. Finally, for the\\n$L^2$-higher-order cases, we compute exact remainder terms by establishing\\nidentities rather than inequalities.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math.CA,math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:56:12Z\"}"}
