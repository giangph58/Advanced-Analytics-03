{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11319v1\", \"title\": \"Sensitivity Analysis of State Space Models for Scrap Composition\\n  Estimation in EAF and BOF\", \"summary\": \"This study develops and analyzes linear and nonlinear state space models for\\nestimating the elemental composition of scrap steel used in steelmaking, with\\napplications to Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) and Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF)\\nprocesses. The models incorporate mass balance equations and are fitted using a\\nmodified Kalman filter for linear cases and the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)\\nfor nonlinear cases. Using Cu and Cr as representative elements, we assess the\\nsensitivity of model predictions to measurement noise in key process variables,\\nincluding steel mass, steel composition, scrap input mass, slag mass, and iron\\noxide fraction in slag. Results show that the models are robust to moderate\\nnoise levels in most variables, particularly when errors are below $10\\\\%$.\\nHowever, accuracy significantly deteriorates with noise in slag mass\\nestimation. These findings highlight the practical feasibility and limitations\\nof applying state space models for real-time scrap composition estimation in\\nindustrial settings.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:59:42Z\"}"}
