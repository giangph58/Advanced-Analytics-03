Renormalization-group\\n(RG)-improved lattice actions can preserve continuum properties, but are in\\ngeneral difficult to parameterize. Machine learning (ML) with gauge-equivariant\\nconvolutional neural networks provides a way to efficiently describe such\\nactions. We test a machine-learned RG-improved lattice gauge action, the\\nclassically perfect fixed-point (FP) action, for four-dimensional SU(3) gauge\\ntheory through Monte Carlo simulations. We establish that the gradient flow of\\nthe FP action is free of tree-level discretization effects to all orders in the\\nlattice spacing, making it classically perfect. This allows us to test the\\nquality of improvement of the FP action, without introducing additional\\nartifacts. We find that discretization effects in gradient-flow observables are\\nhighly suppressed and less than 1% up to lattice spacings of 0.14 fm, allowing\\ncontinuum physics to be extracted from coarse lattices. The quality of\\nimprovement achieved motivates the use of the FP action in future gauge theory\\nstudies. The advantages of ML-based parameterizations also highlight the\\npossibility of realizing quantum perfect actions in lattice gauge theory.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-lat\", \"categories\": \"hep-lat\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T13:14:49Z\"}"}
