{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00534v1\", \"title\": \"A Robust Deep Networks based Multi-Object MultiCamera Tracking System\\n  for City Scale Traffic\", \"summary\": \"Vision sensors are becoming more important in Intelligent Transportation\\nSystems (ITS) for traffic monitoring, management, and optimization as the\\nnumber of network cameras continues to rise. However, manual object tracking\\nand matching across multiple non-overlapping cameras pose significant\\nchallenges in city-scale urban traffic scenarios. These challenges include\\nhandling diverse vehicle attributes, occlusions, illumination variations,\\nshadows, and varying video resolutions. To address these issues, we propose an\\nefficient and cost-effective deep learning-based framework for Multi-Object\\nMulti-Camera Tracking (MO-MCT). The proposed framework utilizes Mask R-CNN for\\nobject detection and employs Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to select target\\nobjects from overlapping detections. Transfer learning is employed for\\nre-identification, enabling the association and generation of vehicle tracklets\\nacross multiple cameras. Moreover, we leverage appropriate loss functions and\\ndistance measures to handle occlusion, illumination, and shadow challenges. The\\nfinal solution identification module performs feature extraction using\\nResNet-152 coupled with Deep SORT based vehicle tracking. The proposed\\nframework is evaluated on the 5th AI City Challenge dataset (Track 3),\\ncomprising 46 camera feeds. Among these 46 camera streams, 40 are used for\\nmodel training and validation, while the remaining six are utilized for model\\ntesting. The proposed framework achieves competitive performance with an IDF1\\nscore of 0.8289, and precision and recall scores of 0.9026 and 0.8527\\nrespectively, demonstrating its effectiveness in robust and accurate vehicle\\ntracking.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T14:00:25Z\"}"}
