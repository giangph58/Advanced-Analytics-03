We present\\nnumerical simulations of the time evolution which consider the multi-level\\nstructure of the driven quantum circuit, looking for a realistic modeling\\ncloser to experimental implementations. The Landau-Zener-St\\\\\\\"uckelberg spectra\\nshow resonances that can be understood as originated from constructive\\ninterference favoring transitions to higher levels. For a truncated two-level\\nsystem (TLS) the resonance patterns can be interpreted using a simplified\\ndescription of the avoided crossing that takes into account the dynamic phase\\naccumulated at each operation point. For the multilevel case, we derive an\\neffective two-level Hamiltonian using a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation\\nstarting from the Floquet Hamiltonian in the Sambe space. Our study provides\\npredictive insight into experimental outcomes, offering an intuitive\\ninterpretation that could also support the implementation of fast-non-adiabatic\\nsingle-qubit gates and entangling protocols.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:28:03Z\"}"}
