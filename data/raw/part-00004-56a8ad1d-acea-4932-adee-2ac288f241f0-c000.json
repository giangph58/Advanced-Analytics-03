In such applications, we want to give\\ncertified probabilistic guarantees on performance under adversarial attacks. We\\npropose a novel method, CIVET, for certified training of VAEs. CIVET depends on\\nthe key insight that we can bound worst-case VAE error by bounding the error on\\ncarefully chosen support sets at the latent layer. We show this point\\nmathematically and present a novel training algorithm utilizing this insight.\\nWe show in an extensive evaluation across different datasets (in both the\\nwireless and vision application areas), architectures, and perturbation\\nmagnitudes that our method outperforms SOTA methods achieving good standard\\nperformance with strong robustness guarantees.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T07:41:40Z\"}"}
