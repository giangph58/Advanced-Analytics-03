In addition to direct CMB\\nconstraints, we incorporate indirect bounds arising from the potential\\noverproduction of primordial gravitational waves (PGWs), particularly through\\nlimits on the effective number of relativistic species, $\\\\Delta N_{\\\\rm eff}$,\\nduring Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). These constraints become especially\\nrelevant in scenarios featuring a stiff post-inflationary equation of state\\n$w_{\\\\rm RH}\\\\geq 0.58$. Our analysis shows that, when both P-ACT-LB-BK18 data\\nand $\\\\Delta N_{\\\\rm eff}$ bounds are considered, the viable number of\\ninflationary e-folds is restricted to the range ($57.9$-$62.2$) at the\\n$2\\\\sigma$ confidence level (C.L.). Correspondingly, the reheating temperature\\nis constrained to lie between the BBN energy scale and $10^{12}$ GeV, with the\\npost-inflationary equation-of-state parameter satisfying $w_{\\\\rm RH} > 0.41$.\\nHowever, no parameter space remains viable at the $1\\\\sigma$ C.L. once $\\\\Delta\\nN_{\\\\rm eff}$ constraints from PGWs are included, rendering the\\nHiggs-Starobinsky model highly restricted.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T17:58:13Z\"}"}
