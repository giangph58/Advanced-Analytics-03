In the quantum regime, these\\nfluctuations and the resulting precision differ strongly depending on whether\\nthe device is of fermionic or bosonic nature. Using scattering theory, we show\\nthat the precision is bounded by constraints set by the entropy production and\\nby the activity in the spirit of thermodynamic or kinetic uncertainty\\nrelations, valid for fermionic and bosonic quantum systems and even in the\\nabsence of time-reversal symmetry. Furthermore, we derive a combined\\nthermodynamic kinetic uncertainty relation, which is tight over a wide range of\\nparameters and can hence predict the reachable precision of a device.\\n  Since these constraints can be expressed in terms of observables accessible\\nin transport measurements, such as currents and bandwidth, we foresee that the\\ntight thermodynamic kinetic uncertainty-like bounds are also useful as an\\ninference tool: they can be exploited to estimate entropy production from\\ntransport observables, such as the charge current and its noise, which are more\\neasily accessible in experiment.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.stat-mech,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:09:09Z\"}"}
