As examples of the landscape of machines, ranging from ancient\\nERLs up to future projects, this chapter will give results of the runs from\\nCBETA (USA) and S-DALINAC (Germany). The two facilities bERLin-Pro/SEALab\\n(Germany) and MESA (Germany) will belong to the next ERLs to be in operation\\nand will be introduced briefly. The way to future ERLs will also be addressed.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.acc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.acc-ph,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T11:45:02Z\"}"}
