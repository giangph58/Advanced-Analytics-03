{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15063v1\", \"title\": \"Mining Characteristics of Vulnerable Smart Contracts Across Lifecycle\\n  Stages\", \"summary\": \"Smart contracts are the cornerstone of decentralized applications and\\nfinancial protocols, which extend the application of digital currency\\ntransactions. The applications and financial protocols introduce significant\\nsecurity challenges, resulting in substantial economic losses. Existing\\nsolutions predominantly focus on code vulnerabilities within smart contracts,\\naccounting for only 50% of security incidents. Therefore, a more comprehensive\\nstudy of security issues related to smart contracts is imperative. The existing\\nempirical research realizes the static analysis of smart contracts from the\\nperspective of the lifecycle and gives the corresponding measures for each\\nstage. However, they lack the characteristic analysis of vulnerabilities in\\neach stage and the distinction between the vulnerabilities. In this paper, we\\npresent the first empirical study on the security of smart contracts throughout\\ntheir lifecycle, including deployment and execution, upgrade, and destruction\\nstages. It delves into the security issues at each stage and provides at least\\nseven feature descriptions. Finally, utilizing these seven features, five\\nmachine-learning classification models are used to identify vulnerabilities at\\ndifferent stages. The classification results reveal that vulnerable contracts\\nexhibit distinct transaction features and ego network properties at various\\nstages.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T12:42:59Z\"}"}
