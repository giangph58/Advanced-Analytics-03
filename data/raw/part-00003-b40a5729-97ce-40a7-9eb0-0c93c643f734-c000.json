Similar\\ninverse problems have been previously explored for hyperbolic and parabolic\\nequations, with some studies establishing the existence and uniqueness of\\ngeneralized solutions, while others proved the uniqueness of classical\\nsolutions. However, such inverse problems for fractional-order equations have\\nnot been addressed prior to this work. Here, we establish the existence and\\nuniqueness of the weak solution to the considered inverse problem. To solve it,\\nwe employ the Fourier method with respect to the variable independent of the\\nunknown right-hand side, followed by the method of successive approximations to\\ncompute the Fourier coefficients of the solution. Notably, the results obtained\\nare also novel for parabolic equations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:57:23Z\"}"}
