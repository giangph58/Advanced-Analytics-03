{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07959v1\", \"title\": \"CCMNet: Leveraging Calibrated Color Correction Matrices for Cross-Camera\\n  Color Constancy\", \"summary\": \"Computational color constancy, or white balancing, is a key module in a\\ncamera's image signal processor (ISP) that corrects color casts from scene\\nlighting. Because this operation occurs in the camera-specific raw color space,\\nwhite balance algorithms must adapt to different cameras. This paper introduces\\na learning-based method for cross-camera color constancy that generalizes to\\nnew cameras without retraining. Our method leverages pre-calibrated color\\ncorrection matrices (CCMs) available on ISPs that map the camera's raw color\\nspace to a standard space (e.g., CIE XYZ). Our method uses these CCMs to\\ntransform predefined illumination colors (i.e., along the Planckian locus) into\\nthe test camera's raw space. The mapped illuminants are encoded into a compact\\ncamera fingerprint embedding (CFE) that enables the network to adapt to unseen\\ncameras. To prevent overfitting due to limited cameras and CCMs during\\ntraining, we introduce a data augmentation technique that interpolates between\\ncameras and their CCMs. Experimental results across multiple datasets and\\nbackbones show that our method achieves state-of-the-art cross-camera color\\nconstancy while remaining lightweight and relying only on data readily\\navailable in camera ISPs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:59:31Z\"}"}
