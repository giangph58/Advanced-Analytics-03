Here the treatment of optical spectral energy distributions (SEDs)\\nis improved and the counts are extended to 5.6 mu and optical wavelengths. The\\nmodels proved a good fit to the latest, deeper, JWST counts. The models are\\nalso extended to radio and X-ray wavelengths. Predicted redshift distributions\\nare given for a range of wavelengths and flux-densities.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T15:06:07Z\"}"}
