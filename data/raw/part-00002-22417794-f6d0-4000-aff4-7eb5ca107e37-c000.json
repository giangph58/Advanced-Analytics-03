{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12678v1\", \"title\": \"A Genetic Approach to Gradient-Free Kinodynamic Planning in Uneven\\n  Terrains\", \"summary\": \"This paper proposes a genetic algorithm-based kinodynamic planning algorithm\\n(GAKD) for car-like vehicles navigating uneven terrains modeled as triangular\\nmeshes. The algorithm's distinct feature is trajectory optimization over a\\nfixed-length receding horizon using a genetic algorithm with heuristic-based\\nmutation, ensuring the vehicle's controls remain within its valid operational\\nrange. By addressing challenges posed by uneven terrain meshes, such as\\nchanging face normals, GAKD offers a practical solution for path planning in\\ncomplex environments. Comparative evaluations against Model Predictive Path\\nIntegral (MPPI) and log-MPPI methods show that GAKD achieves up to 20 percent\\nimprovement in traversability cost while maintaining comparable path length.\\nThese results demonstrate GAKD's potential in improving vehicle navigation on\\nchallenging terrains.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T06:11:31Z\"}"}
