{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11323v1\", \"title\": \"Domain wall evolution beyond quartic potentials: The Sine-Gordon and\\n  Christ-Lee potentials\", \"summary\": \"Domain walls are the simplest type of topological defects formed at\\ncosmological phase transitions, and one of the most constrained. Their studies\\ntypically assume a quartic double well potential, but this model is not fully\\nrepresentative of the range of known or plausible particle physics models. Here\\nwe study the cosmological evolution of domain walls in two other classes of\\npotentials. The Sine-Gordon potential allows several types of walls,\\ninterpolating between different pairs of minima (which demands specific\\nnumerical algorithms to separately measure the relevant properties of each\\ntype). The Christ-Lee potential parametrically interpolates between sextic and\\nquartic behavior. We use multiple sets of simulations in two and three spatial\\ndimensions, for various cosmological epochs and under various choices of\\ninitial conditions, to discuss the scaling properties of these networks. In the\\nSine-Gordon case, we identify and quantify deviations from the usual scaling\\nbehavior. In the Christ-Lee case, we discuss conditions under which walls form\\n(or not), and quantify how these outcomes depend on parameters such as the\\nenergy difference between the false and true vacua and the expansion rate of\\nthe Universe. Various biased initial conditions are also addressed in\\nappendices. Finally, we briefly comment on the possible cosmological\\nimplications of our results.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:02:35Z\"}"}
