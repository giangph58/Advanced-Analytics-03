{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24231v1\", \"title\": \"Distinct parallel electrostatic collisionless shocks in hot-cold\\n  ablative mixing plasmas\", \"summary\": \"Hot-cold ablative mixing plasmas are ubiquitous in astrophysical and\\nlaboratory systems, where a cold/dense plasma is roughly in pressure balance\\nwith a hot/dilute plasma. Examples include the plasma thermal quench during\\nmajor disruptions in tokamaks, interaction between a central hot-spot and the\\nsolid liner in an inertial confinement fusion (ICF) capsule, and the formation\\nof large-scale structures in galaxy clusters. In such systems, a parallel\\nelectrostatic collisionless shock forms and plays a critical role in both the\\nthermal collapse of the hot plasma and the ablative mixing of cold ions. The\\nformation and dynamics of such shocks are investigated by employing\\none-dimensional VPIC simulations and theoretical analyses, revealing key\\ndifferences from the well-studied collisionless shocks where an over-pressured,\\nhigh-density plasma expands into a rarefied background. Notably, the shock\\nformation has a weak dependence on the plasma pressure, provided that the\\ndensity ratio between the cold and hot plasmas is large. Instead, the shock is\\nprimarily governed by the plasma temperatures on both sides. The collisionless\\nelectron thermal conduction flux in both upstream and downstream regions\\nfollows the free-streaming limit itself, but its spatial gradient exhibits\\nconvective scaling, ensuring the same characteristic length scale of the\\nelectron temperature and density evolution.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:44:34Z\"}"}
