{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23911v1\", \"title\": \"FineCausal: A Causal-Based Framework for Interpretable Fine-Grained\\n  Action Quality Assessment\", \"summary\": \"Action quality assessment (AQA) is critical for evaluating athletic\\nperformance, informing training strategies, and ensuring safety in competitive\\nsports. However, existing deep learning approaches often operate as black boxes\\nand are vulnerable to spurious correlations, limiting both their reliability\\nand interpretability. In this paper, we introduce FineCausal, a novel\\ncausal-based framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the\\nFineDiving-HM dataset. Our approach leverages a Graph Attention Network-based\\ncausal intervention module to disentangle human-centric foreground cues from\\nbackground confounders, and incorporates a temporal causal attention module to\\ncapture fine-grained temporal dependencies across action stages. This\\ndual-module strategy enables FineCausal to generate detailed spatio-temporal\\nrepresentations that not only achieve state-of-the-art scoring performance but\\nalso provide transparent, interpretable feedback on which features drive the\\nassessment. Despite its strong performance, FineCausal requires extensive\\nexpert knowledge to define causal structures and depends on high-quality\\nannotations, challenges that we discuss and address as future research\\ndirections.
