{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11413v1\", \"title\": \"Solving the Phase Problem of Diffraction: X-ray Standing Waves Imaging\\n  on Bismuthene/SiC(0001)\", \"summary\": \"The phase retrieval problem is a fundamental shortcoming of all\\ndiffraction-based methods, arising from the inability to measure the phase of\\nscattered waves. The (normal incidence) X-ray standing wave (NIXSW) technique\\ncircumvents this issue by introducing a (Bragg-generated) X-ray standing wave\\nfield throughout the sample, relative to which any atomic species can be\\nlocalized by probing its fluorescence or photoelectron yield. In essence, in a\\nsingle measurement the complex scattering factor (i.e., its amplitude\\n\\\\textit{and} phase) corresponding to the used Bragg reflection is determined.\\nPerforming this for multiple Bragg reflections enables one to reconstruct the\\nscattering density of the sample in three dimensions, straightforwardly as the\\nFourier sum of all measured (complex) scattering factors. Here, we utilize this\\ntechnique to reveal the structural key features involved in the formation of\\nthe quantum spin Hall insulator bismuthene on silicon carbide. In this\\nprominent example, the two-dimensional Bi layer is confined between a 4H-SiC\\nsubstrate crystal and an epitaxial graphene layer. The key finding is a change\\nin the adsorption site of the Bi atoms underneath the graphene upon\\nhydrogenation, caused by the H-saturation of one (out of three) Si dangling\\nbonds per unit cell. This structural change, clearly revealed by our NIXSW\\nimaging experiment, is the key feature leading to the formation of the\\ncharacteristic band structure of the 2D bismuthene honeycomb.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T17:28:24Z\"}"}
