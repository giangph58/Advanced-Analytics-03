Centralized systems concentrate\\nresources in one location, making management easier but creating single points\\nof failure. Distributed systems, on the other hand, spread resources across\\nmultiple nodes, offering better scalability and fault tolerance, but requiring\\nmore complex management. The choice between them depends on factors like\\napplication needs, scalability, and data sensitivity. Centralized systems suit\\napplications with limited scalability and centralized control, while\\ndistributed systems excel in large-scale environments requiring high\\navailability and performance. This paper explores a distributed document\\nrepository system developed for the Italian Ministry of Justice, using edge\\nrepositories to analyze textual data and metadata, enhancing semantic\\nexploration capabilities.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC,cs.AI,cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T11:30:16Z\"}"}
