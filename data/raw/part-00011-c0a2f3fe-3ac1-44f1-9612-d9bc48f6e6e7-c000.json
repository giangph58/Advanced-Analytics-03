Dispersive magnetic excitations were\\nmeasured throughout the Brillouin zone and modelled using mean-field\\nrandom-phase approximation to determine the magnetic interactions between Nd\\nions. Our analysis reveals that the magnetic interactions in this system extend\\nover large distances and are significantly affected by a crystallographic\\nsuperstructure formed by ordering of the Pd and Si atoms. The results suggest\\nthat the mechanism for the skyrmion phase formation in this family of\\nmaterials, e.g. Gd$_2$PdSi$_3$ is through the long-range RKKY interactions\\nrather than short-range triangular-lattice frustration.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.other\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T10:20:39Z\"}"}
