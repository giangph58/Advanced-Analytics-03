This work focuses on enhancing the semantic\\nunderstanding of the text data to improve the effectiveness of semantic\\nexchange. We propose a novel semantic communication system for text\\ntransmission, in which the semantic understanding is enhanced by coarse-to-fine\\nprocessing. Especially, a dual attention mechanism is proposed to capture both\\nthe coarse and fine semantic information. Numerical experiments show the\\nproposed system outperforms the benchmarks in terms of bilingual evaluation,\\nsentence similarity, and robustness under various channel conditions.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T07:50:35Z\"}"}
