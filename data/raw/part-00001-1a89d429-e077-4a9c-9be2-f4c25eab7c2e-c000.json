We start with the classical\\nequation of motion and then pick out the comb component, which will help us to\\ndefine the loop kernels. Then we construct the $\\\\ell$-loop integrands based on\\nsome recursion rules for the $\\\\ell$-loop kernels. Finally, we reach a recursion\\nformula for the $\\\\ell$-loop planar integrands. Our method can be easily\\ngeneralized to general quantum field theories, even non-Lagrangian theories, to\\nobtain the planar part of the whole $\\\\ell$-loop integrands.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T08:43:33Z\"}"}
