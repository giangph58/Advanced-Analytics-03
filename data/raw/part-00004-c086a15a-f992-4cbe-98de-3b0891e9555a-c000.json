An advertorial\\nattack was carried out using the FGSM method to maximize the gradient. A\\ncomparison is made of the effectiveness of binary classifiers in the task of\\ndetecting distorted data. The dynamics of changes in the quality indicators of\\nthe regression model were analyzed in conditions without adversarial attacks,\\nduring an adversarial attack and when the distorted data was isolated. It is\\nshown that an adversarial FGSM attack with gradient maximization leads to an\\nincrease in the value of the MSE metric by 33% and a decrease in the R2\\nindicator by 10% on average. The LightGBM binary classifier effectively\\nidentifies data with adversarial anomalies with 98% accuracy. Regression\\nmachine learning models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, but rapid\\nanalysis of network traffic and data transmitted over the network makes it\\npossible to identify malicious activity\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T12:36:05Z\"}"}
