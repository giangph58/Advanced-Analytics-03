This\\nsupports the Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture in Kerr spacetimes. Unlike in\\nthe spin $+2$ case, the spin $-2$ Teukolsky field is regular on the Cauchy\\nhorizon and the first term in its asymptotic development vanishes. As a result,\\nthe derivation of a precise lower bound for the spin $-2$ field is more\\ndelicate than in the spin $+2$ case, and relies on a novel ODE method based on\\na decomposition of the Teukolsky operator between radial and time derivatives.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:05:27Z\"}"}
