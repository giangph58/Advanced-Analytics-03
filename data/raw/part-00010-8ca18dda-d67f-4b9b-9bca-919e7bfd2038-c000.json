{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04912v1\", \"title\": \"Using random perturbations to infer the structure of feedback control in\\n  gene expression\", \"summary\": \"Feedback in cellular processes is typically inferred through cellular\\nresponses to experimental perturbations. Modular response analysis provides a\\ntheoretical framework for translating specific perturbations into feedback\\nsensitivities between cellular modules. However, in large-scale drug\\nperturbation studies the effect of any given drug may not be known and may not\\nonly affect one module at a time. Here, we analyze the response of gene\\nexpression models to random perturbations that affect multiple modules\\nsimultaneously. In the deterministic regime we analytically show how cellular\\nresponses to infinitesimal random perturbations can be used to infer the nature\\nof feedback regulation in gene expression, as long as the effects of\\nperturbations are statistically independent between modules. We numerically\\nextend this deterministic analysis to the response of average abundances of\\nstochastic gene expression models to finite perturbations. Across a large\\nsample of stochastic models, the response of average abundances generally\\nobeyed predicted bounds from the deterministic analysis, but dramatic\\ndeviations occurred in systems with bimodal or fat-tailed stationary state\\ndistributions. These discrepancies demonstrate how deterministic analyses can\\nfail to capture the effect of perturbations on averages of stochastic cellular\\nfeedback systems--even in the linear response regime.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.MN\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.MN\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T03:02:28Z\"}"}
