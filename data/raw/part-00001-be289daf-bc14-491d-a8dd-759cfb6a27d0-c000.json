{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21412v1\", \"title\": \"On the Encapsulation of Medical Imaging AI Algorithms\", \"summary\": \"In the context of collaborative AI research and development projects, it\\nwould be ideal to have self-contained encapsulated algorithms that can be\\neasily shared between different parties, executed and validated on data at\\ndifferent sites, or trained in a federated manner. In practice, all of this is\\npossible but greatly complicated, because human supervision and expert\\nknowledge is needed to set up the execution of algorithms based on their\\ndocumentation, possibly implicit assumptions, and knowledge about the execution\\nenvironment and data involved.\\n  We derive and formulate a range of detailed requirements from the above goal\\nand from specific use cases, focusing on medical imaging AI algorithms.\\nFurthermore, we refer to a number of existing APIs and implementations and\\nreview which aspects each of them addresses, which problems are still open, and\\nwhich public standards and ontologies may be relevant. Our contribution is a\\ncomprehensive collection of aspects that have not yet been addressed in their\\nentirety by any single solution.\\n  Working towards the formulated goals should lead to more sustainable\\nalgorithm ecosystems and relates to the FAIR principles for research data,\\nwhere this paper focuses on interoperability and (re)usability of medical\\nimaging AI algorithms.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T08:12:09Z\"}"}
