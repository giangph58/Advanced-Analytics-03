A simple, generalised model is used to\\nestimate the impact of selling heat on profitability, and compare it to selling\\nelectricity, for a variety of fusion proposed power plant permutations\\ndescribed in literature.\\n  Heat production has the potential to significantly improve the financial\\nperformance of fusion over selling electricity. Upon entering a highly\\nelectrified energy system, fusion should aim to operate as a grid-scale heat\\npump, avoiding both electrical conversion and recirculation costs whilst\\nexploiting firm demand for high-value heat. This strategy is relatively\\nhigh-risk, high-reward, but options are identified for hedging these risks. We\\nalso identify and discuss new avenues for competition in this domain, which\\nwould not exist if fusion supplies electricity only.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph,econ.GN,physics.plasm-ph,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T11:15:26Z\"}"}
