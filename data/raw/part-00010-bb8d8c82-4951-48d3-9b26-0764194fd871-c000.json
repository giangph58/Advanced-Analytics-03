{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03296v1\", \"title\": \"The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Discrete-Time Gaussian Process\\n  Mixtures for Robot Policy Learning\", \"summary\": \"We present Mixture of Discrete-time Gaussian Processes (MiDiGap), a novel\\napproach for flexible policy representation and imitation learning in robot\\nmanipulation. MiDiGap enables learning from as few as five demonstrations using\\nonly camera observations and generalizes across a wide range of challenging\\ntasks. It excels at long-horizon behaviors such as making coffee, highly\\nconstrained motions such as opening doors, dynamic actions such as scooping\\nwith a spatula, and multimodal tasks such as hanging a mug. MiDiGap learns\\nthese tasks on a CPU in less than a minute and scales linearly to large\\ndatasets. We also develop a rich suite of tools for inference-time steering\\nusing evidence such as collision signals and robot kinematic constraints. This\\nsteering enables novel generalization capabilities, including obstacle\\navoidance and cross-embodiment policy transfer. MiDiGap achieves\\nstate-of-the-art performance on diverse few-shot manipulation benchmarks. On\\nconstrained RLBench tasks, it improves policy success by 76 percentage points\\nand reduces trajectory cost by 67%. On multimodal tasks, it improves policy\\nsuccess by 48 percentage points and increases sample efficiency by a factor of\\n20. In cross-embodiment transfer, it more than doubles policy success. We make\\nthe code publicly available at https://midigap.cs.uni-freiburg.de.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:27:23Z\"}"}
