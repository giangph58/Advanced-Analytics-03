{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10966v1\", \"title\": \"Non-uniqueness of mild solutions for 2d-heat equations with singular\\n  initial data\", \"summary\": \"In a recent article by the authors [15] it was shown that wide classes of\\nsemilinear elliptic equations with exponential type nonlinearities admit\\nsingular radial solutions $U$ on the punctured disc in $\\\\mathbb R^2$ which are\\nalso distributional solutions on the whole disc. We show here that these\\nsolutions, taken as initial data of the associated heat equation, give rise to\\nnon-uniqueness of mild solutions: ${u_s}(t,x) \\\\equiv U(x)$ is a stationary\\nsolution, and there exists also a solution ${u_r}(t,x)$ departing from $U$\\nwhich is bounded for $t > 0$. While such non-uniqueness results have been known\\nin higher dimensions by Ni--Sacks [33], Terraneo [40] and Galaktionov--Vazquez\\n[16], only two very specific results have recently been obtained in two\\ndimensions by Ioku--Ruf--Terraneo [22] and Ibrahim--Kikuchi--Nakanishi--Wei\\n[21].\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T08:17:49Z\"}"}
