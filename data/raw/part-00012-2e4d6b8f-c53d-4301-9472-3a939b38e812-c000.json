{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21384v1\", \"title\": \"Logical Modelling in CS Education: Bridging the Natural Language Gap\", \"summary\": \"An important learning objective for computer science students is to learn how\\nto formalize descriptions of real world scenarios in order to subsequently\\nsolve real world challenges using methods and algorithms from formal\\nfoundations of computer science. Two key steps when formalizing with logical\\nformalisms are to (a) choose a suitable vocabulary, that is, e.g., which\\npropositional variables or first-order symbols to use, and with which intended\\nmeaning, and then to (b) construct actual formal descriptions, i.e. logical\\nformulas over the chosen vocabulary. While (b) is addressed by several\\neducational support systems for formal foundations of computer science, (a) is\\nso far not addressed at all -- likely because it involves specifying the\\nintended meaning of symbols in natural language.\\n  We propose a conceptual framework for educational tasks where students choose\\na vocabulary, including an enriched language for describing solution spaces as\\nwell as an NLP-approach for checking student attempts and providing feedback.\\nWe implement educational tasks for designing propositional and first-order\\nvocabularies within the Iltis educational system, and report on experiments\\nwith data from introductory logic courses for computer science students with >\\n25.000 data points.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LO\", \"categories\": \"cs.LO,cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T07:34:41Z\"}"}
