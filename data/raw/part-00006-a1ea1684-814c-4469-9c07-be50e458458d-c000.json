These methods have been applied in a wide range of\\nfields by providing solutions to intractable likelihood problems in which exact\\nBayesian approaches are either infeasible or computationally costly. However,\\nthe performance of ABC can be unreliable when dealing with model\\nmisspecification. To circumvent the poor behavior of ABC in these settings, we\\npropose a novel ABC approach that is robust to model misspecification. This new\\nmethod can deliver more accurate statistical inference under model\\nmisspecification than alternatives and also enables the detection of summary\\nstatistics that are incompatible with the assumed data-generating process. We\\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through several simulated\\nexamples, where it delivers more accurate point estimates and uncertainty\\nquantification over standard ABC approaches when the model is misspecified.\\nAdditionally, we apply our approach to an empirical example, further showcasing\\nits advantages over alternative methods.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,stat.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T05:11:02Z\"}"}
