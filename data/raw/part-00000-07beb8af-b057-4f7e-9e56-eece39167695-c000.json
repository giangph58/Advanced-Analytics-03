The\\nparametrization of $t$ with $u$ permits to reduce at the minimum the presence\\nof discontinuous trigonometric functions. This is helpful as they must be\\nproperly connected via accumulation functions to finally have a smooth\\ncoordinate time $t(u)$. Another difficulty relies on the presence of an\\ninfinite sum, about which we derive a compact form. This effort reveals to be\\nextremely useful for application purposes. Indeed, we need to truncate the\\naforementioned sum to a certain finite threshold, which strongly depends on the\\nselected parameter values and the accuracy error we would like to achieve.\\nThanks to our work, this analysis can be easily carried out.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.HE,hep-th,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T09:53:26Z\"}"}
