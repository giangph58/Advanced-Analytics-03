{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15247v1\", \"title\": \"Lance: Efficient Random Access in Columnar Storage through Adaptive\\n  Structural Encodings\", \"summary\": \"The growing interest in artificial intelligence has created workloads that\\nrequire both sequential and random access. At the same time, NVMe-backed\\nstorage solutions have emerged, providing caching capability for large columnar\\ndatasets in cloud storage. Current columnar storage libraries fall short of\\neffectively utilizing an NVMe device's capabilities, especially when it comes\\nto random access. Historically, this has been assumed an implicit weakness in\\ncolumnar storage formats, but this has not been sufficiently explored. In this\\npaper, we examine the effectiveness of popular columnar formats such as Apache\\nArrow, Apache Parquet, and Lance in both random access and full scan tasks\\nagainst NVMe storage.\\n  We argue that effective encoding of a column's structure, such as the\\nrepetition and validity information, is the key to unlocking the disk's\\nperformance. We show that Parquet, when configured correctly, can achieve over\\n60x better random access performance than default settings. We also show that\\nthis high random access performance requires making minor trade-offs in scan\\nperformance and RAM utilization. We then describe the Lance structural encoding\\nscheme, which alternates between two different structural encodings based on\\ndata width, and achieves better random access performance without making\\ntrade-offs in scan performance or RAM utilization.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DB\", \"categories\": \"cs.DB,H.3.2\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T17:22:18Z\"}"}
