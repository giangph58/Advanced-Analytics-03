The ability to accurately transmit and receive data is the basis for\\nhigh-speed communications and precise sensing, where a fundamental requirement\\nis an accurate in-phase (I) and quadrature-phase (Q) modulation. For sensing,\\nimperfections in IQ modulation lead to two critical issues in the\\nrange-Doppler-map (RDM) in form of an increased noise floor and the presence of\\nghost objects, degrading the accuracy and reliability of the information in the\\nRDM. This paper presents a low-complex estimation and compensation method to\\nmitigate the IQ imbalance effects. This is achieved by utilizing, amongst\\nothers, the leakage signal, which is the direct signal from the transmitter to\\nthe receiver path, and is typically the strongest signal component in the RDM.\\nThe parameters of the IQ imbalance suppression structure are estimated based on\\na mixed complex-/real-valued bilinear filter approach, that considers IQ\\nimbalance in the transmitter and the receiver of the JCAS-capable user\\nequipment (UE). The UE uses a 5G New Radio (NR)-compliant orthogonal\\nfrequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform with the system configuration\\nassumed to be predefined from the communication side. To assess the\\neffectiveness of the proposed approach, simulations are conducted, illustrating\\nthe performance in the suppression of IQ imbalance introduced distortions in\\nthe RDM.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T14:38:41Z\"}"}
