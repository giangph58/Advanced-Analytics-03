{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12293v1\", \"title\": \"Exceptional times when bigeodesics exist in dynamical last passage\\n  percolation\", \"summary\": \"It is believed that, under very general conditions, doubly infinite geodesics\\n(or bigeodesics) do not exist for planar first and last passage percolation\\n(LPP) models. However, if one endows the model with a natural dynamics, thereby\\ngradually perturbing the geometry, then it is plausible that there could exist\\na non-trivial set of exceptional times $\\\\mathscr{T}$ at which such bigeodesics\\nexist, and the objective of this paper is to investigate this set. For\\ndynamical exponential LPP, we obtain an $\\\\Omega( 1/\\\\log n)$ lower bound on the\\nprobability that there exists a random time $t\\\\in [0,1]$ at which a geodesic of\\nlength $n$ passes through the origin at its midpoint -- note that this is\\nslightly short of proving the non-triviality of the set $\\\\mathscr{T}$ which\\nwould instead require an $\\\\Omega(1)$ lower bound. In the other direction,\\nworking with a dynamical version of Brownian LPP, we show that the average\\ntotal number of changes that a geodesic of length $n$ accumulates in unit time\\nis at most $n^{5/3+o(1)}$; using this, we establish that the Hausdorff\\ndimension of $\\\\mathscr{T}$ is a.s. upper bounded by $1/2$. Further, for a fixed\\nangle $\\\\theta$, we show that the set $\\\\mathscr{T}^\\\\theta\\\\subseteq \\\\mathscr{T}$\\nof exceptional times at which a $\\\\theta$-directed bigeodesic exists a.s. has\\nHausdorff dimension zero. We provide a list of open questions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T17:56:01Z\"}"}
