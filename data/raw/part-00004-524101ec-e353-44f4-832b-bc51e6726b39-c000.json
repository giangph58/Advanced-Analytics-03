Traditional\\nmethods for separating P- and S-waves rely on the Christoffel equation to\\ncompute the polarization direction of the waves in the wavenumber domain, which\\nis computationally expensive. Although machine learning has been employed to\\nimprove the computational efficiency of the separation process, most methods\\nstill require supervised learning with labeled data, which is often unavailable\\nfor field data. To address this limitation, we propose a wavefield separation\\ntechnique based on the physics-informed neural network (PINN). This\\nunsupervised machine learning approach is applicable to unlabeled data.\\nFurthermore, the trained PINN model provides a mesh-free numerical solution\\nthat effectively captures wavefield features at multiple scales. Numerical\\ntests demonstrate that the proposed PINN-based separation method can accurately\\nseparate P- and S-waves in both homogeneous and heterogeneous media.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.geo-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.geo-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T08:18:09Z\"}"}
