After that, tame arrangements have\\nbeen applied to a lot of researches on arrangements including freeness, master\\nfunctions and critical varieties, Solomon-Terao algebras, D-modules,\\nBernstein-Sato polynomials and likelihood geometry. Though arrangements are\\ngenerically tame, the research on tame arrangements themselves have been only\\nfew. In this article we establish foundations for the research of tame\\narrangements. Namely, we prove the addition theorem for tame arrangements,\\nZiegler-Yoshinaga type results for tameness and combinatorially determined\\ntameness.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG,math.AC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T07:16:01Z\"}"}
