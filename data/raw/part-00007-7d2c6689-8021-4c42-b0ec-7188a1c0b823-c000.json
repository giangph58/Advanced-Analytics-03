{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17511v1\", \"title\": \"Subcode Ensemble Decoding of Polar Codes\", \"summary\": \"In the short block length regime, pre-transformed polar codes together with\\nsuccessive cancellation list (SCL) decoding possess excellent error correction\\ncapabilities. However, in practice, the list size is limited due to the\\nsuboptimal scaling of the required area in hardware implementations.\\nAutomorphism ensemble decoding (AED) can improve performance for a fixed list\\nsize by running multiple parallel SCL decodings on permuted received words,\\nyielding a list of estimates from which the final estimate is selected. Yet,\\nAED is limited to appropriately designed polar codes. Subcode ensemble decoding\\n(ScED) was recently proposed for low-density parity-check codes and does not\\nimpose such design constraints. It uses multiple decodings in different\\nsubcodes, ensuring that the selected subcodes jointly cover the original code.\\nWe extend ScED to polar codes by expressing polar subcodes through suitable\\npre-transformations (PTs). To this end, we describe a framework classifying\\npre-transformations for pre-transformed polar codes based on their role in\\nencoding and decoding. Within this framework, we propose a new type of PT\\nenabling ScED for polar codes, analyze its properties, and discuss how to\\nconstruct an efficient ensemble.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T12:55:23Z\"}"}
