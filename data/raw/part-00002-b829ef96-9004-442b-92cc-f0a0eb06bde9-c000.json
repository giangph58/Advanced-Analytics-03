{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24234v1\", \"title\": \"Beyond Gaussian Assumptions: A Nonlinear Generalization of Linear\\n  Inverse Modeling\", \"summary\": \"The Linear Inverse Model (LIM) is a class of data-driven methods that\\nconstruct approximate linear stochastic models to represent complex\\nobservational data. The stochastic forcing can be modeled using either Gaussian\\nwhite noise or Ornstein-Uhlenbeck colored noise; the corresponding models are\\ncalled White-LIM and Colored-LIM, respectively. Although LIMs are widely\\napplied in climate sciences, they inherently approximate observed distributions\\nas Gaussian, limiting their ability to capture asymmetries.\\n  In this study, we extend LIMs to incorporate nonlinear dynamics, introducing\\nWhite-nLIM and Colored-nLIM which allow for a more flexible and accurate\\nrepresentation of complex dynamics from observations. The proposed methods not\\nonly account for the nonlinear nature of the underlying system but also\\neffectively capture the skewness of the observed distribution. Moreover, we\\napply these methods to a lower-dimensional representation of ENSO and\\ndemonstrate that both White-nLIM and Colored-nLIM successfully capture its\\nnonlinear characteristic.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:46:06Z\"}"}
