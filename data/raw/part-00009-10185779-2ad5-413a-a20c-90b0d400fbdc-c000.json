The proposed system is\\ncapable of detecting a diverse range of objects and estimating their positions\\nwithout requiring fine-tuning for specific environments. The system's\\nperformance was evaluated through a simulated search-and-rescue scenario, where\\nthe MorphoGear robot successfully located a robotic dog while an operator\\nmonitored the process. This work contributes to the development of intelligent,\\nmultimodal robotic systems capable of operating in unstructured environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T17:41:12Z\"}"}
