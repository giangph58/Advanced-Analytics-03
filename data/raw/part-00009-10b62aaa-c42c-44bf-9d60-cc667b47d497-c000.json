{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20444v1\", \"title\": \"On Psychology of AI -- Does Primacy Effect Affect ChatGPT and Other\\n  LLMs?\", \"summary\": \"We study the primacy effect in three commercial LLMs: ChatGPT, Gemini and\\nClaude. We do this by repurposing the famous experiment Asch (1946) conducted\\nusing human subjects. The experiment is simple, given two candidates with equal\\ndescriptions which one is preferred if one description has positive adjectives\\nfirst before negative ones and another description has negative adjectives\\nfollowed by positive ones. We test this in two experiments. In one experiment,\\nLLMs are given both candidates simultaneously in the same prompt, and in\\nanother experiment, LLMs are given both candidates separately. We test all the\\nmodels with 200 candidate pairs. We found that, in the first experiment,\\nChatGPT preferred the candidate with positive adjectives listed first, while\\nGemini preferred both equally often. Claude refused to make a choice. In the\\nsecond experiment, ChatGPT and Claude were most likely to rank both candidates\\nequally. In the case where they did not give an equal rating, both showed a\\nclear preference to a candidate that had negative adjectives listed first.\\nGemini was most likely to prefer a candidate with negative adjectives listed\\nfirst.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T05:35:23Z\"}"}
