Our research augments\\nextant studies on black hole thermodynamic phase diagrams, particularly in the\\nregime above the critical point, by delineating the Widom line of AdS black\\nholes. This boundary segregates the supercritical domain of the phase diagram\\ninto two disparate zones. As the system traverses the thermodynamic crossover\\nwithin the supercritical region, it undergoes a transition from one\\nsupercritical phase to another, while maintaining the continuity of its\\nthermodynamic state functions. This behavior is fundamentally different from\\nthat below the critical point, where crossing the coexistence line results in\\ndiscontinuities of thermodynamic state functions. The Widom line enables a\\nthermodynamic crossover between single-phase states without traversing the\\nspinodal that emerges in the critical region.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T06:03:39Z\"}"}
