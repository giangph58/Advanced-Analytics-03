Palma published in 2015. In this\\nnote we confirm that this group is Hermitian by proving the following more\\ngeneral theorem: given any local field $\\\\mathbb{K}$, the affine group\\n$\\\\mathbb{K} \\\\rtimes \\\\mathbb{K}^*$ is a Hermitian group. The proof is a simple\\nconsequence of results about Hermitian Banach $*$-algebras from the 1970's. In\\nthe case that $\\\\mathbb{K}$ is a non-archimedean local field, this result\\nproduces examples of totally disconnected locally compact Hermitian groups with\\nexponential growth, and as far as the author is aware, these are the first\\nexamples of groups satisfying these properties. This answers a second question\\nof Palma about the existence of such groups.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA,math.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:53:50Z\"}"}
