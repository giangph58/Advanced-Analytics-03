Furthermore, quantum machine learning (QML)\\npromises to rapidly improve our current machine learning capabilities. However,\\ncurrent noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices are constrained by\\nlimitations in the number of qubits and gate counts, which hinder their full\\ncapabilities. Furthermore, the design of quantum algorithms remains a laborious\\ntask, requiring significant domain expertise and time. Quantum Architecture\\nSearch (QAS) aims to streamline this process by automatically generating novel\\nquantum circuits, reducing the need for manual intervention. In this paper, we\\npropose a diffusion-based algorithm leveraging the LayerDAG framework to\\ngenerate new quantum circuits. This method contrasts with other approaches that\\nutilize large language models (LLMs), reinforcement learning (RL), variational\\nautoencoders (VAE), and similar techniques. Our results demonstrate that the\\nproposed model consistently generates 100% valid quantum circuit outputs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:10:10Z\"}"}
