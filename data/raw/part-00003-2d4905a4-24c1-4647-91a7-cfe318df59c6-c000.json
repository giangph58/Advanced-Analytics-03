{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04499v1\", \"title\": \"Phase sensitivity via photon-subtraction operations inside Mach-Zehnder\\n  interferometer\", \"summary\": \"Based on the conventional Mach-Zehnder interferometer, we propose a\\nmetrological scheme to improve phase sensitivity. In this scheme, we use a\\ncoherent state and a squeezed vacuum state as input states, employ\\nmulti-photon-subtraction operations and make intensity-detection or\\nhomodyne-detection. We study phase sensitivity, quantum Fisher information and\\nquantum Cram\\\\'er-Rao bound under both ideal and lossy conditions. The results\\nindicate that choosing an appropriate detection method and photon subtraction\\nscheme can significantly enhance the phase sensitivity and robustness against\\nphoton losses. Even under lossy conditions, the multi-photon subtraction\\nschemes can surpass the standard quantum limit. Notably, the homodyne detection\\nmethod can even break through the Heisenberg limit. Moreover, increasing the\\nnumber of photon-subtracted can enhance both phase sensitivity and quantum\\nFisher information. This research highlights the significant value of this\\nscheme in quantum precision measurement.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T15:20:55Z\"}"}
