{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12238v1\", \"title\": \"Exceptional deficiency of non-Hermitian systems: high-dimensional\\n  coalescence and dynamics\", \"summary\": \"Exceptional points (EPs) are non-Hermitian singularities associated with the\\ncoalescence of individual eigenvectors accompanied by the degeneracy of their\\ncomplex energies. Here, we report the discovery of a generalization to the\\nconcept of EP called exceptional deficiency (ED), which features the complete\\ncoalescence of two eigenspaces with identical but arbitrarily large dimensions\\nand the coincidence of entire spectral continua. The characteristics of the ED\\nare studied using one-way coupled Hermitian and non-Hermitian lattices. The ED\\ncan induce an anomalous absence and presence of non-Hermitian skin effect\\n(NHSE) that transcends the topological bulk-edge correspondence of NHSE,\\nresulting in unexpected synergistic skin-propagative dynamics. The conditions\\nof the ED are also explored for unprecedented control of localization and\\npropagation in non-Hermitian systems. These effects are experimentally observed\\nusing active mechanical lattices. The discovery of ED opens multiple new\\nfrontiers in non-Hermitian physics and can potentially resolve long-standing\\nchallenges in related applications.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.class-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T16:43:42Z\"}"}
