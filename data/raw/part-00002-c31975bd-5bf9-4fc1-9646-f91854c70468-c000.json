{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00696v1\", \"title\": \"On the Beilinson-Bloch conjecture over function fields\", \"summary\": \"Let k be a field and X a smooth projective variety over k. When k is a number\\nfield, the Beilinson--Bloch conjecture relates the ranks of the Chow groups of\\nX to the order of vanishing of certain L-functions. We consider the same\\nconjecture when k is a global function field, and give a criterion for the\\nconjecture to hold for X, extending an earlier result of Jannsen. As an\\napplication, we provide a new proof of a theorem of Geisser connecting the Tate\\nconjecture over finite fields and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture over\\nfunction fields. We then prove the Tate conjecture for a product of a smooth\\nprojective curve with a power of a CM elliptic curve over any finitely\\ngenerated field, and thus deduce special cases of the Beilinson--Bloch\\nconjecture. In the process we obtain a conditional answer to a question of\\nMoonen on the Chow groups of powers of ordinary CM elliptic curves over\\narbitrary fields.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT,math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T17:57:08Z\"}"}
