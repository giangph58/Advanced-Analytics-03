{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15712v1\", \"title\": \"(Thermo-)dynamics of the spin-boson model in the weak coupling regime:\\n  Application as a quantum battery\", \"summary\": \"We investigate the spin-boson model's dynamical and thermodynamic features in\\nthe weak coupling regime using the weak coupling spin-boson (WCSB) and phase\\ncovariant (PC) master equations. Both unital (pure dephasing) and non-unital\\n(dissipative) quantum channels are considered. On the dynamical side, we\\nexplore key quantum features including non-Markovianity, quantum speed limit,\\nquantum coherence, and the system's steady-state behavior. Notably, the\\nmeasures of non-Markovianity exhibit different behavior under WCSB and PC\\ndynamics. From the quantum thermodynamic perspective, we conceptualize the\\nspin-boson system as a quantum battery and analyze its performance through\\nmetrics such as energy, ergotropy, anti-ergotropy, and battery capacity. We\\nfurther examine the roles of pure dephasing and dissipative processes in\\nshaping the battery's performance. Our findings demonstrate the spin-boson\\nmodel's versatility as a platform for efficient energy storage and transfer in\\nquantum thermodynamic devices.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T08:53:57Z\"}"}
