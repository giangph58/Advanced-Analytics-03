Patent matching is a crucial task in\\nintellectual property management, which facilitates the organization and\\nutilization of patents. Existing models often rely on the emergent capabilities\\nof Large Language Models (LLMs) and leverage them to identify related patents\\ndirectly. However, these methods usually depend on matching keywords and\\noverlook the hierarchical classification and categorical relationships of\\npatents. In this paper, we propose MemGraph, a method that augments the patent\\nmatching capabilities of LLMs by incorporating a memory graph derived from\\ntheir parametric memory. Specifically, MemGraph prompts LLMs to traverse their\\nmemory to identify relevant entities within patents, followed by attributing\\nthese entities to corresponding ontologies. After traversing the memory graph,\\nwe utilize extracted entities and ontologies to improve the capability of LLM\\nin comprehending the semantics of patents. Experimental results on the\\nPatentMatch dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of MemGraph, achieving a\\n17.68% performance improvement over baseline LLMs. The further analysis\\nhighlights the generalization ability of MemGraph across various LLMs, both\\nin-domain and out-of-domain, and its capacity to enhance the internal reasoning\\nprocesses of LLMs during patent matching.
