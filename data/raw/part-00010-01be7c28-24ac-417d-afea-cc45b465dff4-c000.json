We consider two types of holographic scenarios analogous to the\\nstatic patch holography and the half de Sitter holography, in which the\\nholographic boundary is timelike and placed in the bulk. We find in general\\nthat the strong subadditivity can be satisfied only in the former type and in\\naddition the holographic boundary has to fit inside the apparent horizon. Also,\\nfor the universe filled with an ideal fluid of constant equation of state\\n$w<-1$, the condition is sharpened as that the holographic boundary has to fit\\ninside the event horizon instead. These conditions provide a necessary\\ncondition for the dual quantum field theory to be standard and compatible with\\nthe strong subadditivity.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,astro-ph.CO,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:44:34Z\"}"}
