{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11760v1\", \"title\": \"The Topological Structures of the Orders of Hypergraphs\", \"summary\": \"We provide first a categorical exploration of, and then completion of the\\nmapping of the relationships among, three fundamental perspectives on binary\\nrelations: as the incidence matrices of hypergraphs, as the formal contexts of\\nconcept lattices, and as specifying topological cosheaves of simplicial\\n(Dowker) complexes on simplicial (Dowker) complexes. We provide an integrative,\\nfunctorial framework combining previously known with three new results: 1)\\ngiven a binary relation, there are order isomorphisms among the bounded edge\\norder of the intersection complexes of its dual hypergraphs and its concept\\nlattice; 2) the concept lattice of a context is an isomorphism invariant of the\\nDowker cosheaf (of abstract simplicial complexes) of that context; and 3) a\\nnovel Dowker cosheaf (of chain complexes) of a relation is an isomorphism\\ninvariant of the concept lattice of the context that generalizes Dowker's\\noriginal homological result. We illustrate these concepts throughout with a\\nrunning example, and demonstrate relationships to past results.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,math.AT,math.CT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T04:40:12Z\"}"}
