{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05215v1\", \"title\": \"Quasinormal modes and absorption cross-section of a Bardeen black hole\\n  surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter in four dimensions\", \"summary\": \"In this paper we study quasinormal modes and absorption cross sections for\\nthe $(1+3)$-dimensional Bardeen black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark\\nmatter. Studies of the massless scalar field is already done in\\n\\\\cite{Sun:2023slzl}. Hence, in this paper we will focus on the massive scalar\\nfield perturbations and massless Dirac field perturbations. To compute the\\nquasinormal modes we use the semi-analytical 3rd-order WKB method, which has\\nbeen shown to be one of the best approaches when the effective potential is\\nadequate and when $n < \\\\ell$ and $n < \\\\lambda$. We have also utilized the\\nP\\\\\\\"oschl-Teller method to compare the valus obtained using the WKB approach. We\\nhave computed quasinormal frequencies by varying various parameters of the\\ntheory such as the mass of the scalar field $\\\\mu$, dark matter parameter\\n$\\\\alpha$ and the magnetic charge $g$. We have summarized our solutions in\\ntables and figures for clarity. As for the absorption cross section, we used\\nthird order WKB approach to compute reflection, transmission coefficients and\\npartial absorption cross sections. Graphs are presented to demonstrate the\\nbehavior of the above quantities when the dark matter parameter and mass of the\\nmassive scalar field are varied.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.SR,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T16:02:22Z\"}"}
