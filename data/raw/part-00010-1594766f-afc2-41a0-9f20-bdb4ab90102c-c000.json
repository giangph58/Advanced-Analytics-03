{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02274v1\", \"title\": \"Extended Hybridization Expansion Solver for Impurity Models with\\n  Retarded Interactions\", \"summary\": \"We extend the continuous-time hybridization expansion solver to a general\\nform, where the hybridization function and retarded interaction are treated on\\nequal footing. Correlation functions can now be directly obtained via\\nfunctional derivatives with respect to the bosonic propagators, similar to the\\nmeasurement of Green's functions. We devise a combinatorial scheme of measuring\\nthe correlation function, whose efficiency partially emulates that of the\\nGreen's function measurement. The algorithm and numerical methods are validated\\nthrough application to an impurity model involving both electron-phonon\\ncoupling and exchange interactions, a case where the previous hybridization\\nexpansion algorithm is not applicable. Our improvement of the hybridization\\nexpansion solver promotes its applicability in studies of electron-phonon\\ncoupling, the extended dynamical mean field theory, and the dual boson method.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T04:49:35Z\"}"}
