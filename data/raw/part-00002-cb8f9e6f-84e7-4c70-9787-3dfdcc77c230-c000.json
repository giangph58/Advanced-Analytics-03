Some\\nmutations resulted in changes in the amino acid sequences of viral proteins,\\nincluding the Spike glycoproteins, affecting protein physico-chemical\\nproperties and functionalities. Here, we propose, for the first time to the\\nbest of our knowledge, a systematic and comparative study of the monomeric\\nspike protein subunits 1 of three SARS-CoV-2 variants at pH 7.4, combining both\\nan experimental approach, taking advantage of Attenuated Total Reflection\\nInfrared and Circular Dichroism spectroscopies, and a computational approach\\nvia Molecular Dynamics simulations. Experimental data in combination with\\nMolecular Dynamics and Surface polarity calculations provide a comprehensive\\nunderstanding of variants proteins in terms of their secondary structure\\ncontent, 3D conformational structure and order and interaction with the\\nsolvent. The present structural investigation clarifies which kind of changes\\nin conformation and functionalities occurred as long as mutations appeared in\\namino acids sequences. This information is essential for preventive targeted\\nactions, drug design, and biosensing applications.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.bio-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.bio-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T13:07:00Z\"}"}
