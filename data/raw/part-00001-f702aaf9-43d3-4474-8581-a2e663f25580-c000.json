{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10050v1\", \"title\": \"Emotional Strain and Frustration in LLM Interactions in Software\\n  Engineering\", \"summary\": \"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into various daily\\ntasks in Software Engineering such as coding and requirement elicitation.\\nDespite their various capabilities and constant use, some interactions can lead\\nto unexpected challenges (e.g. hallucinations or verbose answers) and, in turn,\\ncause emotions that develop into frustration. Frustration can negatively impact\\nengineers' productivity and well-being if they escalate into stress and\\nburnout. In this paper, we assess the impact of LLM interactions on software\\nengineers' emotional responses, specifically strains, and identify common\\ncauses of frustration when interacting with LLMs at work. Based on 62 survey\\nresponses from software engineers in industry and academia across various\\ncompanies and universities, we found that a majority of our respondents\\nexperience frustrations or other related emotions regardless of the nature of\\ntheir work. Additionally, our results showed that frustration mainly stemmed\\nfrom issues with correctness and less critical issues such as adaptability to\\ncontext or specific format. While such issues may not cause frustration in\\ngeneral, artefacts that do not follow certain preferences, standards, or best\\npractices can make the output unusable without extensive modification, causing\\nfrustration over time. In addition to the frustration triggers, our study\\noffers guidelines to improve the software engineers' experience, aiming to\\nminimise long-term consequences on mental health.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:55:47Z\"}"}
