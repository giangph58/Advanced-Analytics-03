{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21812v1\", \"title\": \"Easily Computed Marginal Likelihoods for Multivariate Mixture Models\\n  Using the THAMES Estimator\", \"summary\": \"We present a new version of the truncated harmonic mean estimator (THAMES)\\nfor univariate or multivariate mixture models. The estimator computes the\\nmarginal likelihood from Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples, is\\nconsistent, asymptotically normal and of finite variance. In addition, it is\\ninvariant to label switching, does not require posterior samples from hidden\\nallocation vectors, and is easily approximated, even for an arbitrarily high\\nnumber of components. Its computational efficiency is based on an\\nasymptotically optimal ordering of the parameter space, which can in turn be\\nused to provide useful visualisations. We test it in simulation settings where\\nthe true marginal likelihood is available analytically. It performs well\\nagainst state-of-the-art competitors, even in multivariate settings with a high\\nnumber of components. We demonstrate its utility for inference and model\\nselection on univariate and multivariate data sets.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:15:55Z\"}"}
