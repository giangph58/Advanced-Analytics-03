{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01915v1\", \"title\": \"Overcoming Deceptiveness in Fitness Optimization with Unsupervised\\n  Quality-Diversity\", \"summary\": \"Policy optimization seeks the best solution to a control problem according to\\nan objective or fitness function, serving as a fundamental field of engineering\\nand research with applications in robotics. Traditional optimization methods\\nlike reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms struggle with deceptive\\nfitness landscapes, where following immediate improvements leads to suboptimal\\nsolutions. Quality-diversity (QD) algorithms offer a promising approach by\\nmaintaining diverse intermediate solutions as stepping stones for escaping\\nlocal optima. However, QD algorithms require domain expertise to define\\nhand-crafted features, limiting their applicability where characterizing\\nsolution diversity remains unclear. In this paper, we show that unsupervised QD\\nalgorithms - specifically the AURORA framework, which learns features from\\nsensory data - efficiently solve deceptive optimization problems without domain\\nexpertise. By enhancing AURORA with contrastive learning and periodic\\nextinction events, we propose AURORA-XCon, which outperforms all traditional\\noptimization baselines and matches, in some cases even improving by up to 34%,\\nthe best QD baseline with domain-specific hand-crafted features. This work\\nestablishes a novel application of unsupervised QD algorithms, shifting their\\nfocus from discovering novel solutions toward traditional optimization and\\nexpanding their potential to domains where defining feature spaces poses\\nchallenges.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NE\", \"categories\": \"cs.NE,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T17:18:21Z\"}"}
