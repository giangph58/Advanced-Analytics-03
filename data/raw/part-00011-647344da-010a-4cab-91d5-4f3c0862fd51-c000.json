{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20731v1\", \"title\": \"Multiwavelength correlation studies in the era of CTAO\", \"summary\": \"Correlations between various multiwavelength (MWL) bands are an intermittent\\nfeature in blazar light curves; that is, they are observed in some instances\\nbut not in others. With the CTAO we will obtain detailed very-high-energy (VHE)\\ngamma-ray light curves for many sources also during their low states, enabling\\ndetailed MWL correlation studies. For two blazars, the HBL Mrk\\\\,421 and the\\nFSRQ PKS\\\\,1510-089, the long-term X-ray and optical light curves are used to\\ninduce variations in input parameters of the lepto-hadronic one-zone code\\nOneHaLe. We show light curves in the CTA energy range for three different\\nenergy thresholds. The results are: 1) the presence of relativistic protons has\\na significant effect on the correlation of the light curves as the emerging\\npair cascade prolongs flaring states at the highest energies; and 2) comparison\\nof the theoretical light curves with existing VHE gamma-ray data shows that\\nboth leptonic and hadronic models can only partially reproduce the data.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:14:36Z\"}"}
