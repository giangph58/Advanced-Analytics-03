{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04966v1\", \"title\": \"Position: The AI Conference Peer Review Crisis Demands Author Feedback\\n  and Reviewer Rewards\", \"summary\": \"The peer review process in major artificial intelligence (AI) conferences\\nfaces unprecedented challenges with the surge of paper submissions (exceeding\\n10,000 submissions per venue), accompanied by growing concerns over review\\nquality and reviewer responsibility. This position paper argues for the need to\\ntransform the traditional one-way review system into a bi-directional feedback\\nloop where authors evaluate review quality and reviewers earn formal\\naccreditation, creating an accountability framework that promotes a\\nsustainable, high-quality peer review system. The current review system can be\\nviewed as an interaction between three parties: the authors, reviewers, and\\nsystem (i.e., conference), where we posit that all three parties share\\nresponsibility for the current problems. However, issues with authors can only\\nbe addressed through policy enforcement and detection tools, and ethical\\nconcerns can only be corrected through self-reflection. As such, this paper\\nfocuses on reforming reviewer accountability with systematic rewards through\\ntwo key mechanisms: (1) a two-stage bi-directional review system that allows\\nauthors to evaluate reviews while minimizing retaliatory behavior, (2)a\\nsystematic reviewer reward system that incentivizes quality reviewing. We ask\\nfor the community's strong interest in these problems and the reforms that are\\nneeded to enhance the peer review process.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T05:51:48Z\"}"}
