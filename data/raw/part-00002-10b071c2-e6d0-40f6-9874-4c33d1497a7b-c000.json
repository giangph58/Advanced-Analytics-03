Recently a dynamic\\nversion of this problem was defined, called the \\\\emph{mobile general position\\nproblem}, in which a collection of robots must visit all the vertices of the\\ngraph whilst remaining in general position. In this paper we investigate this\\nproblem in the context of Cartesian products, corona products and joins, giving\\nupper and lower bounds for general graphs and exact values for families\\nincluding grids, cylinders, Hamming graphs and prisms of trees.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T14:00:59Z\"}"}
