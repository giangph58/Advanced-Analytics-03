{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12824v1\", \"title\": \"Mixed Structural Choice Operator: Enhancing Technology Mapping with\\n  Heterogeneous Representations\", \"summary\": \"The independence of logic optimization and technology mapping poses a\\nsignificant challenge in achieving high-quality synthesis results. Recent\\nstudies have improved optimization outcomes through collaborative optimization\\nof multiple logic representations and have improved structural bias through\\nstructural choices. However, these methods still rely on technology-independent\\noptimization and fail to truly resolve structural bias issues. This paper\\nproposes a scalable and efficient framework based on Mixed Structural Choices\\n(MCH). This is a novel heterogeneous mapping method that combines multiple\\nlogic representations with technology-aware optimization. MCH flexibly\\nintegrates different logic representations and stores candidates for various\\noptimization strategies. By comprehensively evaluating the technology costs of\\nthese candidates, it enhances technology mapping and addresses structural bias\\nissues in logic synthesis. Notably, the MCH-based lookup table (LUT) mapping\\nalgorithm set new records in the EPFL Best Results Challenge by combining the\\nstructural strengths of both And-Inverter Graph (AIG) and XOR-Majority Graph\\n(XMG) logic representations. Additionally, MCH-based ASIC technology mapping\\nachieves a 3.73% area and 8.94% delay reduction (balanced), 20.35% delay\\nreduction (delay-oriented), and 21.02% area reduction (area-oriented),\\noutperforming traditional structural choice methods. Furthermore, MCH-based\\nlogic optimization utilizes diverse structures to surpass local optima and\\nachieve better results.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AR\", \"categories\": \"cs.AR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T10:34:52Z\"}"}
