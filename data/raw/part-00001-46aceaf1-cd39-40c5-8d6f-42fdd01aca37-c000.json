This work addresses a novel hybrid algorithm\\nthat models the close coupling between compressible flows and deformable\\nmaterials using a mesoscopic approach. Specifically, the high-speed flows are\\ndescribed by the gas-kinetic scheme, which is a robust Navier-Stokes\\nalternative solver built on the molecular kinetic theory. The deformation,\\ndamage, and fracture of materials are depicted using the bond-based\\nperidynamics, which serves as coarse-grained molecular dynamics to construct\\nnon-local extensions of classical continuum mechanics. The evolution of fluids\\nand materials are closely coupled using the ghost-cell immersed boundary\\nmethod. Within each time step, the solutions of flow and solid fields are\\nupdated simultaneously, and physics-driven boundary conditions are exchanged\\nfor each other via ghost cells. Extensive numerical experiments, including\\ncrack propagation in a pre-cracked plate, subsonic flow around the NACA0012\\nairfoil, supersonic flow around the circular cylinder, and shock wave impacting\\non the elastic panel, are performed to validate the algorithm. The simulation\\nresults demonstrate the unique advantages of current hybrid algorithm in\\nsolving fracture propagation induced by high-speed flows.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T09:25:14Z\"}"}
