Their proof developed a new path recording technique [MH24].\\n  In this work, we show that a linear number of sequential repetitions of the\\nparallel Kac's Walk, introduced by Lu, Qin, Song, Yao and Zhao [LQSY+24], also\\nforms an adaptive-secure PRU, confirming a conjecture therein. Moreover, it\\nadditionally satisfies strong security against adversaries making inverse\\nqueries. This gives an alternative PRU construction, and provides another\\ninstance demonstrating the power of the path recording technique. We also\\ndiscuss some further simplifications and implications.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.CC,cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T08:32:14Z\"}"}
