In the first half of this paper, we construct\\na perfect pairing between the internal zonotopal algebra of a linear space and\\nthe reduced Orlik--Terao algebra of the Gale dual linear space. As an\\napplication, we prove a conjecture of Moseley--Proudfoot--Young that relates\\nthe reduced Orlik--Terao algebra of a graph to the cohomology of a certain\\nconfiguration space. In the second half of the paper, we interpret the Macaulay\\ninverse system of a zonotopal algebra as the space of sections of a sheaf on\\nthe Schubert variety of a linear space. As an application of this, we use an\\nequivariant resolution of the structure sheaf of the Schubert variety inside of\\na product of projective lines to produce an exact sequence relating internal\\nand external zonotopal algebras.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG,math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:10:13Z\"}"}
