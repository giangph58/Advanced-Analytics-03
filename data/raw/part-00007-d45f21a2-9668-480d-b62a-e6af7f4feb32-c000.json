{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05297v1\", \"title\": \"Eigenvalue-Based Randomness Test for Residual Diagnostics in Panel Data\\n  Models\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces the Eigenvalue-Based Randomness (EBR) test - a novel\\napproach rooted in the Tracy-Widom law from random matrix theory - and applies\\nit to the context of residual analysis in panel data models. Unlike traditional\\nmethods, which target specific issues like cross-sectional dependence or\\nautocorrelation, the EBR test simultaneously examines multiple assumptions by\\nanalyzing the largest eigenvalue of a symmetrized residual matrix. Monte Carlo\\nsimulations demonstrate that the EBR test is particularly robust in detecting\\nnot only standard violations such as autocorrelation and linear cross-sectional\\ndependence (CSD) but also more intricate non-linear and non-monotonic\\ndependencies, making it a comprehensive and highly flexible tool for enhancing\\nthe reliability of panel data analyses.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,econ.EM,stat.AP,stat.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T17:52:36Z\"}"}
