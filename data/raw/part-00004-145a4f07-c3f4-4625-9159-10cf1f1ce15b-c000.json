By systematically varying key binary parameters, such as the initial\\norbital boost, which determines the orbital angular momentum, and the relative\\nphase between the stars, we examine how the internal phase structure of the\\nProca field influences the merger dynamics and the properties of the emitted\\nGWs. Our simulations demonstrate that the relative phase has paramount impact\\non the post-merger evolution, resulting in prompt black hole formation\\naccompanied by a transient Proca remnant, the formation of a hypermassive $\\\\bar\\nm=1$ Proca star or even the emergence of a dynamically-unstable spinning $\\\\bar\\nm=2$ Proca star. Under certain conditions, the GW signal exhibits significant\\nodd-modes (e.g., the $\\\\ell=m=3$ mode) that are absent in conventional black\\nhole mergers, potentially serving as unique signatures of these exotic objects.\\nOur findings offer new insights into the phenomenology of bosonic star mergers\\nand the potential astrophysical role of ultralight bosonic fields.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T13:59:33Z\"}"}
