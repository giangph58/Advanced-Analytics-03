The first is to show that\\nquasiconformality and quasisymmetry with respect to the quasihyperbolic metric\\nare equivalent. The second is to study normal quasiregular maps from such a\\ndomain into $S^n$ or $\\\\mathbb{R}^n$ and show they enjoy geometric properties\\nsuch as a uniform H\\\\\\\"{o}lder condition.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CV\", \"categories\": \"math.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:19:34Z\"}"}
