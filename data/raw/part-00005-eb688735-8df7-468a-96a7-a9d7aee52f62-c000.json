Existing sparse retrieval models rely on FLOPS\\nregularization for sparsification, while this mechanism was originally designed\\nfor Siamese encoders, it is considered to be suboptimal in inference-free\\nscenarios which is asymmetric. Previous attempts to adapt FLOPS for\\ninference-free scenarios have been limited to rule-based methods, leaving the\\npotential of sparsification approaches for inference-free retrieval models\\nlargely unexplored. In this paper, we explore $\\\\ell_0$ inspired sparsification\\nmanner for inference-free retrievers. Through comprehensive out-of-domain\\nevaluation on the BEIR benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art\\nperformance among inference-free sparse retrieval models and is comparable to\\nleading Siamese sparse retrieval models. Furthermore, we provide insights into\\nthe trade-off between retrieval effectiveness and computational efficiency,\\ndemonstrating practical value for real-world applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T03:40:43Z\"}"}
