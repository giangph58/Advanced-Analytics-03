{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07616v1\", \"title\": \"Isometric Splitting of Metrics Without Conjugate Points on $\\u03a3\\n  \\\\times S^1$\", \"summary\": \"We study the geometry of Riemannian metrics without conjugate points on\\nmanifolds which are diffeomorphic to $M = \\\\Sigma \\\\times S^1$, where $\\\\Sigma$ is\\na compact orientable surface of genus $g \\\\ge 2$.\\n  This addresses a question related to the generalized Hopf conjecture: whether\\nsuch metrics must necessarily exhibit a product structure on the universal\\ncover, despite the negatively curved nature of $\\\\Sigma$. We prove that any such\\nmetric $g$ forces the universal cover $(\\\\tM, \\\\tg)$ to split isometrically as a\\nRiemannian product $(\\\\Hyp, g_0) \\\\times (\\\\R, c^2 du^2)$, where $(\\\\Hyp, g_0)$ is\\nthe hyperbolic plane equipped with a complete $\\\\pi_1(\\\\Sigma)$-invariant metric\\nand $c>0$ is a constant. This affirmatively resolves the question and extends\\nrigidity theorems known for flat tori and manifolds of non-positive curvature.\\nWe present two proofs: the main proof relies on the analysis of Busemann\\nfunctions associated with the lifted $S^1$-action, while an alternative proof\\nutilizes Jacobi field analysis along the flow lines of the corresponding\\nKilling field. Both approaches show that the absence of conjugate points\\ncompels the horizontal distribution orthogonal to the Killing field flow to be\\nparallel and integrable, leading to a global isometric splitting via the de\\nRham theorem. Several geometric and dynamical consequences follow from this\\nrigid structure.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T10:05:48Z\"}"}
