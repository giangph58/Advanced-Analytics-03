As a consequence, we deduce that, unless they virtually split as direct\\nproducts, periagroups are acylindrically hyperbolic and their conjugacy growth\\nseries, with respect to standard generating sets, are transcendental.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GR\", \"categories\": \"math.GR,math.CO,math.MG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T06:56:05Z\"}"}
