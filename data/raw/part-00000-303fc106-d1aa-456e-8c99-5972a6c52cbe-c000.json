{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10035v1\", \"title\": \"TT3D: Table Tennis 3D Reconstruction\", \"summary\": \"Sports analysis requires processing large amounts of data, which is\\ntime-consuming and costly. Advancements in neural networks have significantly\\nalleviated this burden, enabling highly accurate ball tracking in sports\\nbroadcasts. However, relying solely on 2D ball tracking is limiting, as it\\ndepends on the camera's viewpoint and falls short of supporting comprehensive\\ngame analysis. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach for\\nreconstructing precise 3D ball trajectories from online table tennis match\\nrecordings. Our method leverages the underlying physics of the ball's motion to\\nidentify the bounce state that minimizes the reprojection error of the ball's\\nflying trajectory, hence ensuring an accurate and reliable 3D reconstruction. A\\nkey advantage of our approach is its ability to infer ball spin without relying\\non human pose estimation or racket tracking, which are often unreliable or\\nunavailable in broadcast footage. We developed an automated camera calibration\\nmethod capable of reliably tracking camera movements. Additionally, we adapted\\nan existing 3D pose estimation model, which lacks depth motion capture, to\\naccurately track player movements. Together, these contributions enable the\\nfull 3D reconstruction of a table tennis rally.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:37:47Z\"}"}
