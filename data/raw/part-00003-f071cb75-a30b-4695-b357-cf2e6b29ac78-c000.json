We\\ndiscuss the result in QED with no light fermions, where the first power\\ncorrection can be written explicitly in terms of one loop integrals and the\\nanomalous magnetic moment. In the presence of light fermions, the heavy\\nelectron form factor admits a representation as a sum over matrix elements,\\neach of which receives corrections from higher orders in perturbation theory.\\nFrom this analysis we are able to extract the NLP soft photon theorem in the\\nlimit of heavy fermion initiated dijet events. This is a first step towards\\nstudying the heavy quark form factor in the non-abelian theory.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:02:02Z\"}"}
