{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19865v1\", \"title\": \"Factorization of multimeters: a unified view on nonclassical quantum\\n  phenomena\", \"summary\": \"Quantum theory exhibits various nonclassical features, such as measurement\\nincompatibility, contextuality, steering, and Bell nonlocality, which\\ndistinguish it from classical physics. These phenomena are often studied\\nseparately, but they possess deep interconnections. This work introduces a\\nunified mathematical framework based on commuting diagrams that unifies them.\\nBy representing collections of measurements (multimeters) as maps to the set of\\ncolumn-stochastic matrices, we show that measurement compatibility and\\nsimulability correspond to specific factorizations of these maps through\\nintermediate systems. We apply this framework to put forward connections\\nbetween different nonclassical notions and provide factorization-based\\ncharacterizations for steering assemblages and Bell correlations, including a\\nperspective on the CHSH inequality witnessing measurement incompatibility.\\nFurthermore, we investigate robustness to noise of nonlocal features by\\nexamining factorization conditions for maps involving noisy state spaces,\\nproviding geometric criteria for when noisy multimeters can be simulated by\\nsimpler measurement settings.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:57:46Z\"}"}
