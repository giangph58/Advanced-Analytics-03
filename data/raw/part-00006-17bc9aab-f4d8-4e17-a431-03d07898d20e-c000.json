{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17770v1\", \"title\": \"Zeptosecond free-electron compression through temporal lensing\", \"summary\": \"The pursuit of ever-shorter time scales is a frontier in modern physics,\\nexemplified by the synthesis of attosecond light pulses -- an achievement made\\npossible by coherently superimposing a broad range of photon energies, as\\nrequired by the uncertainty principle. However, extending this progress into\\nthe zeptosecond regime poses significant challenges, as it demands\\nphase-correlated optical spectra spanning hundreds of electronvolts. In this\\ncontext, electrons offer a compelling alternative to light because they can be\\ncoherently manipulated to form broad energy superpositions, as demonstrated by\\nthe generation of attosecond pulses in ultrafast electron microscopes. Here, we\\npropose a practical scheme for compressing free electrons into the zeptosecond\\ndomain by modulating their wave functions using suitably tailored broadband\\nlight fields. Building on recent advances in {free-electron--light--matter}\\ninteractions, our method introduces the concept of temporal lensing -- an\\nextension of conventional optical lensing to the time domain -- to produce\\nelectron pulses with arbitrarily short durations.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T17:41:22Z\"}"}
