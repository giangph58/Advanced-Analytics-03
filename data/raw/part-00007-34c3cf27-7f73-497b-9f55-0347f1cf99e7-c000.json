Furthermore, using the generalized S-procedure for polynomial\\nfunctions, we formulate the design of the modified CBFs as a Sum-Of-Squares\\n(SOS) program, which can be solved efficiently. Via a numerical example, the\\nproposed CBF design is shown to have superior performance over the standard CBF\\nwidely used in existing literature.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T13:38:17Z\"}"}
