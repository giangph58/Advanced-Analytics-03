{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07621v1\", \"title\": \"What causes long outbursts of neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries?\", \"summary\": \"Many neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries (NS LMXBs) with short orbital\\nperiods (~hours) cycle between outburst and quiescent phases, and thus provide\\nan excellent way to study the accretion process. The cause of such outbursts is\\nbelieved to be thermal-viscous instability in the accretion disc. However, some\\nof these transient sources show unusually long outbursts. For example, EXO\\n0748-676 remained in outburst for at least 23 years before entering a\\nquiescence, only to re-emerge 16 years later. We aim to investigate if such\\nlong outbursts could be due to the usual disc instability, or if any other\\nmechanism is required. In order to address this question, we systematically\\ncompare various properties of long outburst and short outburst NS LMXBs. For\\nthis, we analyze the long-term X-ray light curves of many short orbital period\\n(hours) NS LMXBs, examining the outburst duration and the inferred accretion\\nrate, and estimate the accretion disc mass. Our study shows that long outburst\\nsources are well-separated from the short outburst ones in parameter spaces\\ninvolving accretion rate, disc mass, outburst duration, etc. in four ways. This\\nimplies that the thermal-viscous instability in the disc cannot explain the\\nlong outbursts, but could explain the short ones. Moreover, we discuss that\\nboth donor star related and disc related models have difficulties in explaining\\nlong outbursts. Our finding will be crucial to understanding the accretion\\nprocess of transiently accreting neutron stars and black holes.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T10:09:32Z\"}"}
