{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20979v1\", \"title\": \"A Complete Characterization of Passive Unitary Normalizable (PUN)\\n  Gaussian States\", \"summary\": \"We provide a complete characterization of the class of multimode quantum\\nGaussian states that can be reduced to a tensor product of thermal states using\\nonly a passive unitary operator. We call these states \\\\textit{passive unitary\\nnormalizable} (PUN) Gaussian states. The characterization of PUN Gaussian\\nstates is given in three different ways: $(i)$ in terms of their covariance\\nmatrices, $(ii)$ using gauge-invariance (a special class of Glauber--Sudarshan\\n$p$-functions), and $(iii)$ with respect to the recently obtained $(A,\\\\Lambda)$\\nparametrization of Gaussian states in [J. Math. Phys. 62, 022102 (2021)]. In\\nterms of the covariance matrix, our characterization states that an $n$-mode\\nquantum Gaussian state is PUN if and only if its $2n\\\\times 2n$ quantum\\ncovariance matrix $S$ commutes with the standard symplectic matrix $J$. It is\\nwell-known that the so-called gauge-invariant Gaussian states are PUN, but\\nwhether the converse is true is not known in the literature to the best of our\\nknowledge. We establish the converse in affirmation. Lastly, in terms of the\\n$(A,\\\\Lambda)$-parameterization, we show that a Gaussian state with parameters\\n$(A,\\\\Lambda)$ is PUN if and only if $A=0$.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:49:28Z\"}"}
