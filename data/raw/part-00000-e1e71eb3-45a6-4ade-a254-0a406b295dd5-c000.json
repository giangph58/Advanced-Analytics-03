However, the complex\\nenergy landscapes arising from frustrated lattice geometries and competing spin\\ninteractions make these models computationally intractable. To address this\\nchallenge, we design a programmable photonic spin simulator capable of\\nemulating XY models with tunable lattice geometries and spin couplings,\\nallowing systematic exploration of their statistical behavior. We\\nexperimentally observe the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in\\na square-lattice XY model with nearest-neighbor interactions, accurately\\ndetermining its critical temperature. Expanding to frustrated systems, we\\nimplement the approach in triangular and honeycomb lattices, uncovering\\nsophisticated phase transitions and frustration effects, which are consistent\\nwith theoretical predictions. This versatile platform opens avenues for probing\\nunexplored XY model phenomena across diverse geometries and interaction\\nschemes, with potential applications in solving complex optimization and\\nmachine learning problems.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,cond-mat.dis-nn\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:43:21Z\"}"}
