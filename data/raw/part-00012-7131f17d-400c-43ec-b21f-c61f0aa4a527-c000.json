Links\\nto the orthonormal frame approach [37] are drawn to help understand the\\nvariables in this context. Two formulations are derived, discretised and tested\\nusing the exterior calculus discrete de Rham complex [12], and some discrete\\nquantities are shown to be conserved in one of the cases.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,cs.NA,math.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T04:18:49Z\"}"}
