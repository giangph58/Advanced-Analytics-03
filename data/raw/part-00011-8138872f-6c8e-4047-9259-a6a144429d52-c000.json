{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11340v1\", \"title\": \"Organisation and dynamics of individual DNA segments in topologically\\n  complex genomes\", \"summary\": \"Capturing the physical organisation and dynamics of genomic regions is one of\\nthe major open challenges in biology. The kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) is a\\ntopologically complex genome, made by thousands of DNA (mini and maxi) circles\\ninterlinked into a two-dimensional Olympic network. The organisation and\\ndynamics of these DNA circles are poorly understood. In this paper, we show\\nthat dCas9 linked to Quantum Dots can efficiently label different classes of\\nDNA minicircles in kDNA. We use this method to study the distribution and\\ndynamics of different classes of DNA minicircles within the network. We\\ndiscover that maxicircles display a preference to localise at the periphery of\\nthe network and that they undergo subdiffusive dynamics. From the latter, we\\ncan also quantify the effective network stiffness, confirming previous indirect\\nestimations via AFM. Our method could be used more generally, to quantify the\\nlocation, dynamics and material properties of genomic regions in other complex\\ngenomes, such as that of bacteria, and to study their behaviour in the presence\\nof DNA-binding proteins.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,physics.bio-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:12:54Z\"}"}
