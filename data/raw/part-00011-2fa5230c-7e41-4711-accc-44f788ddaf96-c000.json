However, where and\\nhow to place these content to best support the users has been a challenging\\nproblem due to the dynamic nature of MR experiences. In contrast to prior work\\nthat investigates optimization-based methods, we are exploring how\\nreinforcement learning (RL) could assist with continuous 3D content placement\\nthat is aware of users' poses and their surrounding environments. Through an\\ninitial exploration and preliminary evaluation, our results demonstrate the\\npotential of RL to position content that maximizes the reward for users on the\\ngo. We further identify future directions for research that could harness the\\npower of RL for personalized and optimized UI and content placement in MR.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.AI,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T15:21:36Z\"}"}
