{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15755v1\", \"title\": \"Emergent Kitaev materials in synthetic Fermi-Hubbard bilayers\", \"summary\": \"We investigate the emergence of bond-directional spin-spin interactions in a\\nsynthetic Fermi-Hubbard bilayer that can be realized with ultracold fermions in\\nRaman optical lattices. The model exploits synthetic dimensions to couple two\\nhoneycomb layers, each corresponding to a different hyperfine atomic state, via\\nRaman-assisted tunneling and, moreover, via an inter-layer Hubbard repulsion\\ndue to the cold-atom scattering. In the strong-coupling regime at half filling,\\nwe derive effective spin Hamiltonians for the kinetic exchange featuring\\nKitaev, Heisenberg, off-diagonal exchange ($\\\\Gamma$-couplings), as well as\\ntunable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. We identify specific configurations\\nthat generate both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Kitaev couplings with\\nvarious perturbations of relevance to Kitaev materials, providing a tunable\\nplatform that can explore how quantum spin liquids emerge from itinerant\\nfermion systems. We analyze the Fermi-liquid and Mott-insulating phases,\\nhighlighting a correspondence between Dirac and Majorana quasi-particles, with\\npossible phase transitions thereof. In an extreme anisotropic limit, we show\\nthat the model reduces to an inter-layer ribbon in a quasi-1D ladder, allowing\\nfor a numerical study of the correlated ground state using matrix product\\nstates. We find a transition from a symmetry-protected topological insulator to\\na Kitaev-like regime characterized by nonlocal string order. Our results\\nestablish that cold-atom quantum simulators based on Raman optical lattices can\\nbe a playground for extended Kitaev models, bridging itinerant fermionic\\nsystems and spin-liquid physics.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas,cond-mat.str-el,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T10:07:56Z\"}"}
