{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04926v1\", \"title\": \"Coupling of Alfv\\u00e9n and magnetosonic waves in rotating Hall\\n  magnetoplasmas\", \"summary\": \"We study the linear theory of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves, namely the\\nAlfv{\\\\'e}n and the fast and slow magnetosonic modes in a rotating Hall-MHD\\nplasma with the effects of the obliqueness of the external magnetic field and\\nthe Coriolis force and show that these waves can be coupled either by the\\ninfluence of the Coriolis force or the Hall effects. To this end, we derive a\\ngeneral form of the linear dispersion relation for these coupled modes by the\\ncombined influence of the Coriolis force and the Hall effects and analyze\\nnumerically their characteristics in three different plasma-$\\\\beta$ regimes:\\n$\\\\beta\\\\sim1$, $\\\\beta>1$, and $\\\\beta<1$, including some particular cases. We\\nshow that while the coupling between the Alfv{\\\\'e}n and the fast magnetosonic\\nmodes is strong in the low-$\\\\beta$ $(\\\\beta\\\\lesssim1)$ regime and the wave\\ndispersion appears in the form of a thumb curve, in the high-$\\\\beta~(\\\\beta>1)$\\nregime, the strong coupling can occur between the Alfv{\\\\'e}n and the slow\\nmagnetosonic modes and the dispersion appears in the form of a teardrop curve.\\nSwitching of the coupling in the regime of $\\\\beta\\\\sim1$ can occur, i.e.,\\ninstead of a thumb curve, a teardrop curve appears when the obliqueness of\\npropagation and rotational angle are close to $70^\\\\circ$ or more (but less than\\n$90^\\\\circ$). Implications of our results to solar and fusion plasmas are\\nbriefly discussed.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:07:20Z\"}"}
