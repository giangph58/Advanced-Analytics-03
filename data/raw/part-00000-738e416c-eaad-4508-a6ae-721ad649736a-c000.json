{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16642v1\", \"title\": \"Hitting and Covering Affine Families of Convex Polyhedra, with\\n  Applications to Robust Optimization\", \"summary\": \"Geometric hitting set problems, in which we seek a smallest set of points\\nthat collectively hit a given set of ranges, are ubiquitous in computational\\ngeometry. Most often, the set is discrete and is given explicitly. We propose\\nnew variants of these problems, dealing with continuous families of convex\\npolyhedra, and show that they capture decision versions of the two-level finite\\nadaptability problem in robust optimization. We show that these problems can be\\nsolved in strongly polynomial time when the size of the hitting/covering set\\nand the dimension of the polyhedra and the parameter space are constant. We\\nalso show that the hitting set problem can be solved in strongly quadratic time\\nfor one-parameter families of convex polyhedra in constant dimension. This\\nleads to new tractability results for finite adaptability that are the first\\nones with so-called left-hand-side uncertainty, where the underlying problem is\\nnon-linear.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CG\", \"categories\": \"cs.CG,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T12:01:16Z\"}"}
