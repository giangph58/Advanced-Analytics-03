We give a complete element-wise description of\\n$t_{\\\\mathbf u}^\\\\mathcal I(\\\\mathbb T)$ when $u_n\\\\mid u_{n+1}$ for every\\n$n\\\\in\\\\mathbb N$ and under suitable hypotheses on $\\\\mathcal I$. In the special\\ncase when $\\\\mathcal I =\\\\mathcal F in$, we obtain an alternative proof of a\\nsimplified version of a known result.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GN\", \"categories\": \"math.GN,math.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T13:46:01Z\"}"}
