It\\nallows us to build a single-step distance estimate by maximizing the\\ncorresponding likelihood, free from the biases the survey detection limits\\nwould introduce otherwise. Moreover, we expect the current worldwide statistics\\nto be multiplied by O(10) in the upcoming years. This provides a new challenge\\nto handle as the cosmological analysis must stay computationally towable. We\\nshow that the optimization methods used in EDRIS allow for a reasonable time\\ncomplexity of O($N^2$) resulting in a very fast inference process (O(10s) for\\n1500 supernovae).\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T09:36:07Z\"}"}
