This paper presents an efficient method\\nfor precise pose estimation of cuboid-shaped objects, which aims to reduce\\nerrors in target pose in a time-efficient manner. Typical pose estimation\\nmethods like global point cloud registrations are prone to minor pose errors\\nfor which local registration algorithms are generally used to improve pose\\naccuracy. However, due to the execution time overhead and uncertainty in the\\nerror of the final achieved pose, an alternate, linear time approach is\\nproposed for pose error estimation and correction. This paper presents an\\noverview of the solution followed by a detailed description of individual\\nmodules of the proposed algorithm.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T05:43:31Z\"}"}
