{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05001v1\", \"title\": \"SILVIA: Ultra-precision formation flying demonstration for space-based\\n  interferometry\", \"summary\": \"We propose SILVIA (Space Interferometer Laboratory Voyaging towards\\nInnovative Applications), a mission concept designed to demonstrate\\nultra-precision formation flying between three spacecraft separated by 100 m.\\nSILVIA aims to achieve sub-micrometer precision in relative distance control by\\nintegrating spacecraft sensors, laser interferometry, low-thrust and low-noise\\nmicro-propulsion for real-time measurement and control of distances and\\nrelative orientations between spacecraft. A 100-meter-scale mission in a\\nnear-circular low Earth orbit has been identified as an ideal, cost-effective\\nsetting for demonstrating SILVIA, as this configuration maintains a good\\nbalance between small relative perturbations and low risk for collision. This\\nmission will fill the current technology gap towards future missions, including\\ngravitational wave observatories such as DECIGO (DECihertz Interferometer\\nGravitational wave Observatory), designed to detect the primordial\\ngravitational wave background, and high-contrast nulling infrared\\ninterferometers like LIFE (Large Interferometer for Exoplanets), designed for\\ndirect imaging of thermal emissions from nearby terrestrial planet candidates.\\nThe mission concept and its key technologies are outlined, paving the way for\\nthe next generation of high-precision space-based observatories.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM,cs.SY,eess.SY,gr-qc,physics.ins-det\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:27:46Z\"}"}
