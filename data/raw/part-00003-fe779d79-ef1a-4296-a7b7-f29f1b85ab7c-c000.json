One trade sector in which this synergy is\\nclearly critical is that of wildlife trade networks. This highly complex system\\ninvolves important and understudied bidirectional coupling between the economic\\ndecision making of the stakeholders and the contagion dynamics on the emergent\\ntrade network. While each of these components are independently well studied,\\nthere is a meaningful gap in understanding the feedback dynamics that can arise\\nbetween them. In the present study, we describe a general game theoretic model\\nfor trade networks of goods susceptible to contagion. The primary result relies\\non the acyclic nature of the trade network and shows that, through the course\\nof trading with stochastic infections, the probability of infection converges\\nto a directly computable fixed point. This allows us to compute best responses\\nand thus identify equilibria in the game. We present ways to use this model to\\ndescribe and evaluate trade networks in terms of global and individual risk of\\ninfection under a wide variety of structural or individual modifications to the\\ntrade network. In capturing the bidirectional coupling of the system, we\\nprovide critical insight into the global and individual drivers and\\nconsequences for risks of infection inherent in and arising from the global\\nwildlife trade, and any economic trade network with associated contagion risks.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.TH\", \"categories\": \"econ.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:07:24Z\"}"}
