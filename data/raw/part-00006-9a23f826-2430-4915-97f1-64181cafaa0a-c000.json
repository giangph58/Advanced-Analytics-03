Our\\ngoal is to understand the evolution of the network before and after the\\noccurrence of the anomaly by studying the influence of the anomaly on the\\nstructural properties of the network. The anomaly is such that after its\\narrival it attracts newly added edges with fixed probability. We investigate\\nthe growth of degrees in the network, finding that the anomaly's degree\\nincreases almost linearly. We also provide a heuristic derivation for the\\nexponent of the limiting degree distributions of ordinary vertices, and study\\nthe degree growth of the oldest vertex. We show that when the anomaly enters\\nearly, the degree distribution is altered significantly, while a late anomaly\\nhas minimal impact. Our analysis provides deeper insights into the evolution of\\npreferential attachment networks with an anomalous vertex.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T09:10:52Z\"}"}
