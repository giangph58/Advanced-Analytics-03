Through empirical studies in two contexts -- survey article authoring\\nin scholarly research and business document sensemaking -- we examine how\\ndomain expertise shapes patterns of AI delegation and information processing\\namong knowledge workers. Our findings reveal that while experts welcome AI\\nassistance with repetitive information foraging tasks, they prefer to retain\\ncontrol over complex synthesis and interpretation activities that require\\nnuanced domain understanding. We identify implications for designing GenAI\\nsystems that support expert cognition. These include enabling selective\\ndelegation aligned with expertise levels, preserving expert agency over\\ncritical analytical tasks, considering varying levels of domain expertise in\\nsystem design, and supporting verification mechanisms that help users calibrate\\ntheir reliance while deepening expertise. We discuss the inherent tension\\nbetween reducing cognitive load through automation and maintaining the\\ndeliberate practice necessary for expertise development. Lastly, we suggest\\napproaches for designing systems that provide metacognitive support, moving\\nbeyond simple task automation toward actively supporting expertise development.\\nThis work contributes to our understanding of how to design AI systems that\\naugment rather than diminish human expertise in document-centric workflows.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:22:20Z\"}"}
