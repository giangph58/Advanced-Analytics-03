We give observations and particular behaviour for each of these\\nproblems, and prove a first reduction towards confirming the conjecture by\\nBensmail and Mc Inerney. We state a conjecture for Erd\\\\H{o}s' game on the\\nlargest induced maximum degree, and extensions to edge-transitive and,\\nrespectively, regular graphs.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,cs.DM,cs.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T13:01:30Z\"}"}
