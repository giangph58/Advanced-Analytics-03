{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04904v1\", \"title\": \"A kinetic CMA diagram\", \"summary\": \"We present a kinetic Clemmow-Mullaly-Allis (CMA) diagram by systematically\\nanalysing the kinetic effects on the wave propagation in a homogeneous thermal\\nplasma. The differences between the cold and kinetic CMA diagrams are outlined.\\nIt is found that new boundaries for weakly damped left- and right-handed\\ncircularly polarized waves are located above the ion and electron cyclotron\\nfrequency lines in the kinetic CMA diagram. Additionally, Langmuir waves in the\\nkinetic CMA diagram occupy a specific region between the new Langmuir wave\\nboundary and the plasma frequency line, while in the cold CMA diagram, they\\nexist on the plasma frequency line. The extraordinary-Bernstein mode\\ntransformation frequency lines in the kinetic CMA diagram replace the hybrid\\nresonant frequency lines of the cold CMA diagram, with discontinuities between\\ndifferent cyclotron harmonics. These new boundaries partition the parameter\\nspace in the kinetic CMA diagram differently, leading to new inverse wave\\nnormal surfaces in the regions bounded by new boundaries. The kinetic CMA\\ndiagram not only contributes to a basic understanding of wave properties in\\nthermal plasmas, but also can provide a powerful tool to explore new possible\\npropagation paths.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T10:22:29Z\"}"}
