To this end, we\\ncompute the contribution of the dimension-4 twist-2 gluon operator to the\\ntwo-point function of heavy vector and axial vector currents in a rotating\\nframe. As temperature increases, the quark spin contribution slightly\\nincreases, while the quark orbital angular momentum decreases by a comparable\\namount. The gluon contribution remains nearly unchanged. These thermal changes\\ncancel each other, ensuring that the total spin is preserved even at finite\\ntemperature.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T10:27:32Z\"}"}
