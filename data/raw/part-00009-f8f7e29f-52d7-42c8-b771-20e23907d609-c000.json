The main question addressed is whether a 2-valued dynamics can\\nbe defined by the action of a 2-valued group. We construct a class of strongly\\ninvertible continuous 2-valued dynamics on $\\\\mathbb{C}$ such that none of these\\ndynamics can be given by the action of any 2-valued group. We also construct an\\nexample of a continuous 2-valued dynamics on $\\\\mathbb{C}$ that is not strongly\\ninvertible but can be defined by the action of a 2-valued group.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GR\", \"categories\": \"math.GR,math.DS,math.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:32:54Z\"}"}
