{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11284v1\", \"title\": \"Bipartite Ranking From Multiple Labels: On Loss Versus Label Aggregation\", \"summary\": \"Bipartite ranking is a fundamental supervised learning problem, with the goal\\nof learning a ranking over instances with maximal area under the ROC curve\\n(AUC) against a single binary target label. However, one may often observe\\nmultiple binary target labels, e.g., from distinct human annotators. How can\\none synthesize such labels into a single coherent ranking? In this work, we\\nformally analyze two approaches to this problem -- loss aggregation and label\\naggregation -- by characterizing their Bayes-optimal solutions. Based on this,\\nwe show that while both methods can yield Pareto-optimal solutions, loss\\naggregation can exhibit label dictatorship: one can inadvertently (and\\nundesirably) favor one label over others. This suggests that label aggregation\\ncan be preferable to loss aggregation, which we empirically verify.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.IR,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:25:27Z\"}"}
