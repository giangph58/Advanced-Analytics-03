Its\\nspectrum in 0.1-300 GeV band is well described by a power law model with an\\nindex of $2.40\\\\pm0.16$, leading to an energy flux of (5.5$\\\\pm$1.6$)\\\\times$\\n10$^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The GeV Spectral Energy Distribution (SED)\\nof HESS J0632+057 hints for a spectral turn-over between $\\\\sim$10-100 GeV.\\nOrbital analysis reveals a flux enhancement during the phase range of 0.2-0.4,\\nconsistent with the X-ray and TeV light curves, indicating an origin of a\\ncommon particle population. We carried out six deep radio observations on HESS\\nJ0632+057 with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST),\\nevenly distributed across its orbit, reaching a detection sensitivity of\\n2$\\\\mu$Jy. However, no radio pulsation was detected within these observations.\\nThe absence of radio pulsation may be attributed to the dense stellar wind\\nenvironment of HESS J0632+057.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T16:57:27Z\"}"}
