{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20619v1\", \"title\": \"Breaking the Barrier of Self-Concordant Barriers: Faster Interior Point\\n  Methods for M-Matrices\", \"summary\": \"We study two fundamental optimization problems: (1) scaling a symmetric\\npositive definite matrix by a positive diagonal matrix so that the resulting\\nmatrix has row and column sums equal to 1; and (2) minimizing a quadratic\\nfunction subject to hard non-negativity constraints. Both problems lend\\nthemselves to efficient algorithms based on interior point methods (IPMs). For\\ngeneral instances, standard self-concordance theory places a limit on the\\niteration complexity of these methods at $\\\\widetilde{O}\\\\left(n^{1/2}\\\\right)$,\\nwhere $n$ denotes the matrix dimension. We show via an amortized analysis that,\\nwhen the input matrix is an M-matrix, an IPM with adaptive step sizes solves\\nboth problems in only $\\\\widetilde{O}\\\\left(n^{1/3}\\\\right)$ iterations. As a\\ncorollary, using fast Laplacian solvers, we obtain an $\\\\ell_{2}$ flow diffusion\\nalgorithm with depth $\\\\widetilde{O}\\\\left(n^{1/3}\\\\right)$ and work\\n$\\\\widetilde{O}$$\\\\left(n^{1/3}\\\\cdot\\\\text{nnz}\\\\right)$. This result marks a\\nsignificant instance in which a standard log-barrier IPM permits provably fewer\\nthan $\\\\Theta\\\\left(n^{1/2}\\\\right)$ iterations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T10:40:19Z\"}"}
