{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19593v1\", \"title\": \"A Time-dependent Risk-aware distributed Multi-Agent Path Finder based on\\n  A*\", \"summary\": \"Multi-Agent Path-Finding (MAPF) focuses on the collaborative planning of\\npaths for multiple agents within shared spaces, aiming for collision-free\\nnavigation. Conventional planning methods often overlook the presence of other\\nagents, which can result in conflicts. In response, this article introduces the\\nA$^*_+$T algorithm, a distributed approach that improves coordination among\\nagents by anticipating their positions based on their movement speeds. The\\nalgorithm also considers dynamic obstacles, assessing potential collisions with\\nrespect to observed speeds and trajectories, thereby facilitating\\ncollision-free path planning in environments populated by other agents and\\nmoving objects. It incorporates a risk layer surrounding both dynamic and\\nstatic entities, enhancing its utility in real-world applications. Each agent\\nfunctions autonomously while being mindful of the paths chosen by others,\\neffectively addressing the complexities inherent in multi-agent situations. The\\nperformance of A$^*_+$T has been rigorously tested in the Gazebo simulation\\nenvironment and benchmarked against established approaches such as CBS, ECBS,\\nand SIPP. Furthermore, the algorithm has shown competence in single-agent\\nexperiments, with results demonstrating its effectiveness in managing dynamic\\nobstacles and affirming its practical relevance across various scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T08:57:12Z\"}"}
