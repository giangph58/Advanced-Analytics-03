{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16530v1\", \"title\": \"Modern Computational Methods in Reinsurance Optimization: From Simulated\\n  Annealing to Quantum Branch & Bound\", \"summary\": \"We propose and implement modern computational methods to enhance catastrophe\\nexcess-of-loss reinsurance contracts in practice. The underlying optimization\\nproblem involves attachment points, limits, and reinstatement clauses, and the\\nobjective is to maximize the expected profit while considering risk measures\\nand regulatory constraints. We study the problem formulation, paving the way\\nfor practitioners, for two very different approaches: A local search optimizer\\nusing simulated annealing, which handles realistic constraints, and a branch &\\nbound approach exploring the potential of a future speedup via quantum branch &\\nbound. On the one hand, local search effectively generates contract structures\\nwithin several constraints, proving useful for complex treaties that have\\nmultiple local optima. On the other hand, although our branch & bound\\nformulation only confirms that solving the full problem with a future quantum\\ncomputer would require a stronger, less expensive bound and substantial\\nhardware improvements, we believe that the designed application-specific bound\\nis sufficiently strong to serve as a basis for further works. Concisely, we\\nprovide insurance practitioners with a robust numerical framework for contract\\noptimization that handles realistic constraints today, as well as an outlook\\nand initial steps towards an approach which could leverage quantum computers in\\nthe future.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,q-fin.CP,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T08:55:40Z\"}"}
