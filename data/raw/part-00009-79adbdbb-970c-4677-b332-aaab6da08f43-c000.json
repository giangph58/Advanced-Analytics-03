{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12726v1\", \"title\": \"Combining the Maximum Overlap Method with Multiwavelets for\\n  Core-Ionisation Energy Calculations\", \"summary\": \"We present a protocol for computing core-ionisation energies for molecules,\\nwhich is essential for reproducing X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy\\nexperiments. The electronic structure of both the ground state and the\\ncore-ionised states are computed using Multiwavelets and Density-Functional\\nTheory, where the core ionisation energies are computed by virtue of the\\n$\\\\Delta$SCF method. To avoid the collapse of the core-hole state or its\\ndelocalisation, we make use of the Maximum Overlap Method, which provides a\\nconstraint on the orbital occupation. Combining Multiwavelets with the Maximum\\nOverlap Method allows for the first time an all-electron calculation of\\ncore-ionisation energies with Multiwavelets, avoiding known issues connected to\\nthe use of Atomic Orbitals (slow convergence with respect to the basis set\\nlimit, numerical instabilities of core-hole states for large systems). We show\\nthat our results are consistent with previous Multiwavelet calculations which\\nmade use of pseudopotentials, and are generally more precise than corresponding\\nAtomic Orbital calculations. We analyse the results in terms of precision\\ncompared to both Atomic Orbital calculations and Multiwavelets+pseudopotentials\\ncalculations. Moreover, we demonstrate how the protocol can be applied to\\ntarget molecules of relatively large size. Both closed-shell and open-shell\\nmethods have been implemented.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T08:08:19Z\"}"}
