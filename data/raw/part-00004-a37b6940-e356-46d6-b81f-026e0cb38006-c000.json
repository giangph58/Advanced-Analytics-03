{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12215v1\", \"title\": \"Uncertainty-Guided Coarse-to-Fine Tumor Segmentation with Anatomy-Aware\\n  Post-Processing\", \"summary\": \"Reliable tumor segmentation in thoracic computed tomography (CT) remains\\nchallenging due to boundary ambiguity, class imbalance, and anatomical\\nvariability. We propose an uncertainty-guided, coarse-to-fine segmentation\\nframework that combines full-volume tumor localization with refined\\nregion-of-interest (ROI) segmentation, enhanced by anatomically aware\\npost-processing. The first-stage model generates a coarse prediction, followed\\nby anatomically informed filtering based on lung overlap, proximity to lung\\nsurfaces, and component size. The resulting ROIs are segmented by a\\nsecond-stage model trained with uncertainty-aware loss functions to improve\\naccuracy and boundary calibration in ambiguous regions. Experiments on private\\nand public datasets demonstrate improvements in Dice and Hausdorff scores, with\\nfewer false positives and enhanced spatial interpretability. These results\\nhighlight the value of combining uncertainty modeling and anatomical priors in\\ncascaded segmentation pipelines for robust and clinically meaningful tumor\\ndelineation. On the Orlando dataset, our framework improved Swin UNETR Dice\\nfrom 0.4690 to 0.6447. Reduction in spurious components was strongly correlated\\nwith segmentation gains, underscoring the value of anatomically informed\\npost-processing.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T16:08:38Z\"}"}
