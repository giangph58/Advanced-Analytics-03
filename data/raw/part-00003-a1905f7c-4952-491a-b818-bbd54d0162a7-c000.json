In particular, by applying this\\nmethod to the \\\\(n\\\\)-dimensional torus \\\\({\\\\mathbb{T}}^{n}\\\\), we can construct\\nmany new examples of measure-preserving homeomorphisms. We completely\\ncharacterize the measure-preserving homeomorphisms on the two-dimensional torus\\nwhere one coordinate is a translation depending on the other coordinate, and\\ngeneralize this result to the \\\\(n\\\\)-dimensional torus.\\n  For non-commutative compact groups, we generalize the concept of the\\nnormalizer subgroup \\\\(N\\\\left( H\\\\right)\\\\) of the subgroup \\\\(H\\\\) to the\\nnormalizer subset \\\\({E}_{K}( P)\\\\) from the subset \\\\(K\\\\) to the subset \\\\(P\\\\) of\\nthe group of measure-preserving homeomorphisms. We prove that if \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) is the\\nunique \\\\(K\\\\)-invariant measure, then the elements in \\\\({E}_{K}\\\\left( P\\\\right)\\\\)\\nalso preserve \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\). In some non-commutative compact groups the normalizer\\nsubset \\\\({E}_{G}\\\\left( {\\\\mathrm{{AF}}\\\\left( G\\\\right) }\\\\right)\\\\) can give\\nnon-affine homeomorphisms that preserve the Haar measure. Finally, we prove\\nthat when \\\\(G\\\\) is a finite cyclic group and a \\\\(n\\\\)-dimensional torus, then\\n\\\\(\\\\mathrm{{AF}}\\\\left( G\\\\right)= N\\\\left( G\\\\right) = {E}_{G}\\\\left(\\n{\\\\mathrm{{AF}}\\\\left( G\\\\right) }\\\\right)\\\\).\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T14:16:29Z\"}"}
