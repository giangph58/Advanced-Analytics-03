With spatial transcriptomics data sets typically containing data on\\nthousands of different genes, on increasingly large numbers of samples, there\\nis a need for bioinformatics tools that enable the comparison of spatial\\nstructure across large numbers of variables. Here we present PersiST, an\\nexploratory tool that uses topology to automatically compute a continuous\\nmeasure of spatial structure for each gene in a spatial transcriptomics sample.\\nThis quantification can be used for analytical tasks such as spatially variable\\ngene identification, or searching for spatial differences in the expression of\\na gene between samples. We use PersiST to derive biologically meaningful\\ninsights into two public spatial transcriptomics data sets, and we experiment\\nwith applying PersiST to a spatial metabolomics data set, making use of\\nPersiST's non-parametric approach to enable application across different\\nmeasurement types. Our work showcases the advantages of using a continuous\\nquantification of spatial structure over p-value based approaches to SVG\\nidentification, the potential for developing unified methods for the analysis\\nof different spatial `omics modalities, and the utility of persistent homology\\nin big data applications.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.QM\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.QM\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T12:20:02Z\"}"}
