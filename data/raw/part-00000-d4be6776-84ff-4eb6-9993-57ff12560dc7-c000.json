{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00545v1\", \"title\": \"Reducing Student Distraction Through Fuzzy Logic Based Seating\\n  Arrangements\", \"summary\": \"A crucial skill for primary school teachers is maintaining efficient\\nclassroom management. Teachers use classroom seating arrangements to help\\nmaintain this efficiency. However, developing classroom seating arrangements is\\nboth time-consuming and often non-optimal for distraction mitigation. Fuzzy\\nlogic-based approaches for the development of classroom seating arrangements\\ncan reduce development time and minimize classroom distraction. In this study,\\nan original fuzzy logic-based software package named \\\"CUB\\\" is introduced and\\napplied to a modern classroom using \\\"cluster\\\" seating arrangements. The\\ncombination of fuzzy inference systems, fuzzy c-means clustering, sequential,\\nand iterative processes produce ready-to-use seating arrangements for the\\nclassroom in this study. The seating arrangements are compared with an existing\\nset of seating arrangements to validate the results. The author's findings show\\nthat CUB is successful in generating applicable seating arrangements with a\\nsmall liklihood of replicating arrangements. The findings also suggest that\\nfuzz logic-based approaches may be successful in other styles of classroom\\narrangement.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LO\", \"categories\": \"cs.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T14:20:45Z\"}"}
