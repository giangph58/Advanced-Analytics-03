{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11797v1\", \"title\": \"Analysis of Power Swing Characteristics of Grid-Forming VSC System\\n  Considering the Current Limitation Mode\", \"summary\": \"This paper investigates power swing characteristics of grid-forming voltage\\nsource converter (GFM-VSC) systems considering the current limitation mode in\\nboth non-inertial and inertial GFM-VSC systems. Following grid faults,\\nnon-inertial GFM-VSC systems can re-synchronize with the grid but may\\nexperience significant power swings driven by its control dynamics, while\\ninertial GFM-VSC systems may exhibit loss of synchronization (LOS),\\ncharacterized by the divergence of the output angle in the active power control\\nloop. These behaviours are different from conventional synchronous generator\\n(SG)-based systems, where power swings are typically characterized by physical\\nangle deviations among power sources. Based on these findings, this paper\\nexplores the performance of traditional impedance-based swing detection schemes\\nin GFM-VSC systems. The theoretical analysis is validated through various\\nsimulations using the PSCAD/EMTDC platform, covering both single and\\nmulti-machine system scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T06:07:43Z\"}"}
