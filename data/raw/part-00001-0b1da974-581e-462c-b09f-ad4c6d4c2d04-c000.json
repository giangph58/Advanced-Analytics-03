In this work, we present\\nTwin-Co, a framework that leverages synchronized, co-adaptive dialogue to\\nprogressively refine image generation. Instead of a static generation process,\\nTwin-Co employs a dynamic, iterative workflow where an intelligent dialogue\\nagent continuously interacts with the user. Initially, a base image is\\ngenerated from the user's prompt. Then, through a series of synchronized\\ndialogue exchanges, the system adapts and optimizes the image according to\\nevolving user feedback. The co-adaptive process allows the system to\\nprogressively narrow down ambiguities and better align with user intent.\\nExperiments demonstrate that Twin-Co not only enhances user experience by\\nreducing trial-and-error iterations but also improves the quality of the\\ngenerated images, streamlining the creative process across various\\napplications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T05:37:07Z\"}"}
