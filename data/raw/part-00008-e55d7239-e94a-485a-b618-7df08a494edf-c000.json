Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) are emerging\\ntechnologies that have the potential to transform intelligence sharing. This\\npaper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of intelligence sharing and\\nthe role of blockchain and DLT in enhancing it. The paper addresses questions\\nrelated to the definition, objectives, benefits, and impact of intelligence\\nsharing and provides a review of the existing literature. Additionally, the\\npaper explores the challenges associated with blockchain and DLT and their\\npotential impact on security and privacy. The paper also discusses the use of\\nDLT and blockchain in security and intelligence sharing and highlights the\\nassociated challenges and risks. Furthermore, the paper examines the potential\\nimpact of a National Cybersecurity Strategy on addressing cybersecurity risks.\\nFinally, the paper explores the experimental set up required for implementing\\nblockchain and DLT for intelligence sharing and discusses the curricular\\nramifications of intelligence sharing.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T12:38:42Z\"}"}
