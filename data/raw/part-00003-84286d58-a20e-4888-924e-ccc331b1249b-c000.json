However, the challenges of knowledge updates and\\nhallucination issues have limited the application of LLMs in medical scenarios,\\nwhere retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can offer significant assistance.\\nNevertheless, existing retrieve-then-read approaches generally digest the\\nretrieved documents, without considering the timeliness, authoritativeness and\\ncommonality of retrieval. We argue that these approaches can be suboptimal,\\nespecially in real-world applications where information from different sources\\nmight conflict with each other and even information from the same source in\\ndifferent time scale might be different, and totally relying on this would\\ndeteriorate the performance of RAG approaches. We propose PolyRAG that\\ncarefully incorporate judges from different perspectives and finally integrate\\nthe polyviews for retrieval augmented generation in medical applications. Due\\nto the scarcity of real-world benchmarks for evaluation, to bridge the gap we\\npropose PolyEVAL, a benchmark consists of queries and documents collected from\\nreal-world medical scenarios (including medical policy, hospital & doctor\\ninquiry and healthcare) with multiple tagging (e.g., timeliness,\\nauthoritativeness) on them. Extensive experiments and analysis on PolyEVAL have\\ndemonstrated the superiority of PolyRAG.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T07:35:24Z\"}"}
