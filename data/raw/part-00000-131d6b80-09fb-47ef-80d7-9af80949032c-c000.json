{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20582v1\", \"title\": \"Thin accretion disk around a Kerr black hole immersed in swirling\\n  universes\", \"summary\": \"We have studied the properties of the thin accretion disk around a\\nswirling-Kerr black hole, which owns an extra swirling parameter described the\\nrotation of the immersed universe. Our results show that the swirling parameter\\nimprints in the energy flux, temperature distribution and emission spectra of\\nthe disk and gives rise to some new effects differed from those arising from\\nthe black hole spin. With the increasing of the swirling parameter, the energy\\nflux and the radiated temperature in the disk increase in the near region with\\nthe smaller circular orbital radius and decrease in the far region with the\\nlarger circular orbital radius. However, they always increase with the black\\nhole spin. Although the swirling parameter and the black hole spin parameter\\nlead to the higher cut-off frequencies, the background swirling decreases the\\nobserved luminosity of the disk at the lower frequencies and enhances the\\nhigher observed luminosity only at the higher frequencies, which differs from\\nthat of the black hole spin. Moreover, the conversion efficiency increases with\\nthe black hole spin parameter, but decreases with on the swirling parameters.\\nFurthermore, effects of the swirling parameter are found to be suppressed by\\nthe black hole spin parameter. These results could help us to further\\nunderstand the properties of thin accretion disks and the swirling of the\\nuniverse background.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T09:36:49Z\"}"}
