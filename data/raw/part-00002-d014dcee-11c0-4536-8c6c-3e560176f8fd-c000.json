Furthermore, limited by SMPLX's\\nexpressiveness, these methods often focus on body motion but struggle with\\nfacial expressions. To address these challenges, we first introduce an\\nexpressive human model (EHM) to enhance facial expression capabilities and\\ndevelop an accurate tracking method. Based on this template model, we propose\\nGUAVA, the first framework for fast animatable upper-body 3D Gaussian avatar\\nreconstruction. We leverage inverse texture mapping and projection sampling\\ntechniques to infer Ubody (upper-body) Gaussians from a single image. The\\nrendered images are refined through a neural refiner. Experimental results\\ndemonstrate that GUAVA significantly outperforms previous methods in rendering\\nquality and offers significant speed improvements, with reconstruction times in\\nthe sub-second range (0.1s), and supports real-time animation and rendering.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T09:19:16Z\"}"}
