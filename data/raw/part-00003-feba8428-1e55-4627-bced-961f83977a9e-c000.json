In this work, we study\\nthe generalization of the uniform downsampling layer for group equivariant\\narchitectures, e.g., G-CNNs. That is, we aim to downsample signals (feature\\nmaps) on general finite groups with anti-aliasing. This involves the following:\\n(a) Given a finite group and a downsampling rate, we present an algorithm to\\nform a suitable choice of subgroup. (b) Given a group and a subgroup, we study\\nthe notion of bandlimited-ness and propose how to perform anti-aliasing.\\nNotably, our method generalizes the notion of downsampling based on classical\\nsampling theory. When the signal is on a cyclic group, i.e., periodic, our\\nmethod recovers the standard downsampling of an ideal low-pass filter followed\\nby a subsampling operation. Finally, we conducted experiments on image\\nclassification tasks demonstrating that the proposed downsampling operation\\nimproves accuracy, better preserves equivariance, and reduces model size when\\nincorporated into G-equivariant networks\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.CV,math.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T05:29:51Z\"}"}
