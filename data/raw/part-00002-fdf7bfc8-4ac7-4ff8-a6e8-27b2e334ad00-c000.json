{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07630v1\", \"title\": \"An intrinsic cosmological observer\", \"summary\": \"There has been much recent interest in the necessity of an observer degree of\\nfreedom in the description of local algebras in semiclassical gravity. In this\\nwork, we describe an example where the observer can be constructed\\nintrinsically from the quantum fields. This construction involves the slow-roll\\ninflation example recently analyzed by Chen and Penington, in which the\\ngauge-invariant gravitational algebra arises from marginalizing over modular\\nflow in a de Sitter static patch. We relate this procedure to the\\nConnes-Takesaki theory of the flow of weights for type III von Neumann\\nalgebras, and further show that the resulting gravitational algebra can\\nnaturally be presented as a crossed product. This leads to a decomposition of\\nthe gravitational algebra into quantum field and observer degrees of freedom,\\nwith different choices of observer being related to changes in a quantum\\nreference frame for the algebra. We also connect this example to other\\nconstructions of type II algebras in semiclassical gravity, and argue they all\\nshare the feature of being the result of gauging modular flow. The arguments in\\nthis work involve various properties of automorphism groups of hyperfinite\\nfactors, and so in an appendix we review the structure of these groups, which\\nmay be of independent interest for further investigations into von Neumann\\nalgebras in quantum gravity.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T10:25:14Z\"}"}
