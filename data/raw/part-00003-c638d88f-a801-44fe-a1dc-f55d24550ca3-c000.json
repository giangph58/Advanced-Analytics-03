However,\\nwhile they are able to interact with users in languages beyond English, they\\nhave been shown to lack cultural awareness, providing anglocentric or\\ninappropriate responses for underrepresented language communities. To\\ninvestigate this gap and disentangle linguistic versus cultural proficiency, we\\nconduct the first cultural evaluation study for the mid-resource language of\\nDanish, in which native speakers prompt different models to solve tasks\\nrequiring cultural awareness. Our analysis of the resulting 1,038 interactions\\nfrom 63 demographically diverse participants highlights open challenges to\\ncultural adaptation: Particularly, how currently employed automatically\\ntranslated data are insufficient to train or measure cultural adaptation, and\\nhow training on native-speaker data can more than double response acceptance\\nrates. We release our study data as DaKultur - the first native Danish cultural\\nawareness dataset.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.CY,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T08:52:42Z\"}"}
