{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17332v1\", \"title\": \"Bridging Cognition and Emotion: Empathy-Driven Multimodal Misinformation\\n  Detection\", \"summary\": \"In the digital era, social media has become a major conduit for information\\ndissemination, yet it also facilitates the rapid spread of misinformation.\\nTraditional misinformation detection methods primarily focus on surface-level\\nfeatures, overlooking the crucial roles of human empathy in the propagation\\nprocess. To address this gap, we propose the Dual-Aspect Empathy Framework\\n(DAE), which integrates cognitive and emotional empathy to analyze\\nmisinformation from both the creator and reader perspectives. By examining\\ncreators' cognitive strategies and emotional appeals, as well as simulating\\nreaders' cognitive judgments and emotional responses using Large Language\\nModels (LLMs), DAE offers a more comprehensive and human-centric approach to\\nmisinformation detection. Moreover, we further introduce an empathy-aware\\nfiltering mechanism to enhance response authenticity and diversity.\\nExperimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAE outperforms\\nexisting methods, providing a novel paradigm for multimodal misinformation\\ndetection.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T07:48:26Z\"}"}
