{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17636v1\", \"title\": \"A Guide to Structureless Visual Localization\", \"summary\": \"Visual localization algorithms, i.e., methods that estimate the camera pose\\nof a query image in a known scene, are core components of many applications,\\nincluding self-driving cars and augmented / mixed reality systems.\\nState-of-the-art visual localization algorithms are structure-based, i.e., they\\nstore a 3D model of the scene and use 2D-3D correspondences between the query\\nimage and 3D points in the model for camera pose estimation. While such\\napproaches are highly accurate, they are also rather inflexible when it comes\\nto adjusting the underlying 3D model after changes in the scene. Structureless\\nlocalization approaches represent the scene as a database of images with known\\nposes and thus offer a much more flexible representation that can be easily\\nupdated by adding or removing images. Although there is a large amount of\\nliterature on structure-based approaches, there is significantly less work on\\nstructureless methods. Hence, this paper is dedicated to providing the, to the\\nbest of our knowledge, first comprehensive discussion and comparison of\\nstructureless methods. Extensive experiments show that approaches that use a\\nhigher degree of classical geometric reasoning generally achieve higher pose\\naccuracy. In particular, approaches based on classical absolute or\\nsemi-generalized relative pose estimation outperform very recent methods based\\non pose regression by a wide margin. Compared with state-of-the-art\\nstructure-based approaches, the flexibility of structureless methods comes at\\nthe cost of (slightly) lower pose accuracy, indicating an interesting direction\\nfor future work.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:08:36Z\"}"}
