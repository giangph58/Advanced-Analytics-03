{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10052v1\", \"title\": \"Frequency Hopping Waveform Design for Secure Integrated Sensing and\\n  Communications\", \"summary\": \"We introduce a comprehensive approach to enhance the security, privacy, and\\nsensing capabilities of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems by\\nleveraging random frequency agility (RFA) and random pulse repetition interval\\n(PRI) agility (RPA) techniques. The combination of these techniques, which we\\nrefer to collectively as random frequency and PRI agility (RFPA), with channel\\nreciprocity-based key generation (CRKG) obfuscates both Doppler frequency and\\nPRIs, significantly hindering the chances that passive adversaries can\\nsuccessfully estimate radar parameters. In addition, a hybrid information\\nembedding method integrating amplitude shift keying (ASK), phase shift keying\\n(PSK), index modulation (IM), and spatial modulation (SM) is incorporated to\\nincrease the achievable bit rate of the system significantly. Next, a\\nsparse-matched filter receiver design is proposed to efficiently decode the\\nembedded information with a low bit error rate (BER). Finally, a novel\\nRFPA-based secret generation scheme using CRKG ensures secure code creation\\nwithout a coordinating authority. The improved range and velocity estimation\\nand reduced clutter effects achieved with the method are demonstrated via the\\nevaluation of the ambiguity function (AF) of the proposed waveforms.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP,cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:56:18Z\"}"}
