{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19498v1\", \"title\": \"Motion Generation for Food Topping Challenge 2024: Serving Salmon Roe\\n  Bowl and Picking Fried Chicken\", \"summary\": \"Although robots have been introduced in many industries, food production\\nrobots are yet to be widely employed because the food industry requires not\\nonly delicate movements to handle food but also complex movements that adapt to\\nthe environment. Force control is important for handling delicate objects such\\nas food. In addition, achieving complex movements is possible by making robot\\nmotions based on human teachings. Four-channel bilateral control is proposed,\\nwhich enables the simultaneous teaching of position and force information.\\nMoreover, methods have been developed to reproduce motions obtained through\\nhuman teachings and generate adaptive motions using learning. We demonstrated\\nthe effectiveness of these methods for food handling tasks in the Food Topping\\nChallenge at the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation\\n(ICRA 2024). For the task of serving salmon roe on rice, we achieved the best\\nperformance because of the high reproducibility and quick motion of the\\nproposed method. Further, for the task of picking fried chicken, we\\nsuccessfully picked the most pieces of fried chicken among all participating\\nteams. This paper describes the implementation and performance of these\\nmethods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T05:41:09Z\"}"}
