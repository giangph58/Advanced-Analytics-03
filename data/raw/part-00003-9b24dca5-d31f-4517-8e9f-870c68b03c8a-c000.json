{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03162v1\", \"title\": \"Efficient and tunable frequency conversion using periodically poled\\n  thin-film lithium tantalate nanowaveguides\", \"summary\": \"Thin-film lithium tantalate (TFLT) has recently emerged as a promising\\nphotonic platform for chip-scale nonlinear optics due to its weaker\\nphotorefraction, higher optical damage threshold, broader transparency window,\\nand lower birefringence compared to that of thin-film lithium niobate. Here we\\ndevelop an ultralow-loss lithium tantalate integrated photonic platform and\\nreport the first functional second harmonic generator based on high-fidelity\\npoling of z-cut TFLT. As a result, quasi-phase matching (QPM) is performed\\nbetween telecom (1550 nm) and near-visible (775 nm) wavelengths in a straight\\nwaveguide and prompts strong second-harmonic generation with a normalized\\nefficiency of 229 %/W/$cm^2$. An absolute conversion efficiency of 5.5 % is\\nachieved with a pump power of 700 mW. Such a second-harmonic generator exhibits\\nstable temperature tunability (-0.44 nm/$^\\\\circ C$) which is important for\\napplications that require precise frequency alignment such as atomic clocks and\\nquantum frequency conversion.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T04:14:26Z\"}"}
