Our large Monte Carlo simulations show that this formula is in\\nfact quasi-exact across practical parameter ranges.\\n  Extending our analysis to arbitrary block-time distributions as well, we\\ndemonstrate both that--under every admissible inter-block law--the probability\\nthat a block carries an arbitrage trade converges to a universal limit, and\\nthat only constant block spacing attains the asymptotically minimal LVR. This\\nshows that constant block intervals provide the best possible protection\\nagainst arbitrage for liquidity providers. \\\\end{abstract}\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.MF\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.MF,math.PR,q-fin.PM,q-fin.PR,q-fin.TR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T10:30:24Z\"}"}
