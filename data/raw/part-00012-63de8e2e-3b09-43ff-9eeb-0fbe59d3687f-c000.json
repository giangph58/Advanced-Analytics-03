However, existing X-ray studies\\nof nearby star-forming galaxies are limited by insufficient data statistics and\\na lack of suitable spectral modeling to account for X-ray emission and\\nabsorption geometry. We present results from an X-ray spectral study of M51\\nusing 1.3-Ms Chandra data, the most extensive for such a galaxy. This allows\\nthe extraction of diffuse X-ray emission spectra from spiral arm\\nphase-dependent regions using a logarithmic spiral coordinate system. A\\nhierarchical Bayesian approach analyzes these spectra, testing models from\\nsimple 1-T hot plasma to those including distributed hot plasma and\\nX-ray-absorbing cool gas. We recommend a model fitting the spectra well,\\nfeaturing a galactic corona with a lognormal temperature distribution and a\\ndisk with mixed X-ray emissions and absorption. In this model, only half of the\\ncoronal emission is subject to internal absorption. The best-fit absorbing gas\\ncolumn density is roughly twice that inferred from optical extinction of\\nstellar light. The temperature distribution shows a mean temperature of $\\\\sim\\n0.1$ keV and an average one-dex dispersion that is enhanced on the spiral arms.\\nThe corona's radiative cooling might balance the mechanical energy input from\\nstellar feedback. These results highlight the effectiveness of X-ray mapping of\\nthe corona and cool gas in spiral galaxies.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T06:57:57Z\"}"}
