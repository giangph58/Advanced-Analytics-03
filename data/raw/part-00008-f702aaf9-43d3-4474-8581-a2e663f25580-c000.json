{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10057v1\", \"title\": \"Non-Destructive Carotenoid Quantification in Leaves via Raman\\n  Spectroscopy: Optimizing Treatment for Linear Discriminant Analysis\", \"summary\": \"This study introduces a novel method for quantifying challenging carotenoids\\nin leaf tissues, which typically produce less stable signals than fruits,\\ngrains, and roots, by applying Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) modeling to\\ninterpret Raman spectroscopy data. The model's performance was assessed across\\ndifferent spectral preprocessing techniques (smoothing, normalization, baseline\\ncorrection) and through various subsets of relevant Raman shifts. To generate a\\nbroad range of carotenoid contents, genetically modified Arabidopsis thaliana\\nmutants with controlled synthesis and more conventional Spinacia oleracea\\nsamples under dark and salt stress were utilized, allowing for the evaluation\\nof model robustness and practical applicability. Transition scores for\\nArabidopsis thaliana reached 77.27-95.45% in all quantifications, while\\nSpinacia oleracea showed 75-83.33% in 3- and 4-level modeling, demonstrating\\nthe LDA model's strong potential for effective application. Among the spectral\\npreprocessing, smoothing had the greatest impact on model performance,\\nenhancing results for Arabidopsis thaliana but showing better outcomes without\\nsmoothing for Spinacia oleracea. Overall, this study highlights the potential\\nof LDA modeling combined with Raman spectroscopy as a robust and\\nnon-destructive tool for metabolite quantification in herbal plants, with\\npromising applications in agricultural monitoring and quality control.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.QM\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.QM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:59:56Z\"}"}
