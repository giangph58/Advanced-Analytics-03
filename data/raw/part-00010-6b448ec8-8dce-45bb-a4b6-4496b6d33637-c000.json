{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17503v1\", \"title\": \"Tailored minimal reservoir computing: on the bidirectional connection\\n  between nonlinearities in the reservoir and in data\", \"summary\": \"We study how the degree of nonlinearity in the input data affects the optimal\\ndesign of reservoir computers, focusing on how closely the model's nonlinearity\\nshould align with that of the data. By reducing minimal RCs to a single tunable\\nnonlinearity parameter, we explore how the predictive performance varies with\\nthe degree of nonlinearity in the reservoir. To provide controlled testbeds, we\\ngeneralize to the fractional Halvorsen system, a novel chaotic system with\\nfractional exponents. Our experiments reveal that the prediction performance is\\nmaximized when the reservoir's nonlinearity matches the nonlinearity present in\\nthe data. In cases where multiple nonlinearities are present in the data, we\\nfind that the correlation dimension of the predicted signal is reconstructed\\ncorrectly when the smallest nonlinearity is matched. We use this observation to\\npropose a method for estimating the minimal nonlinearity in unknown time series\\nby sweeping the reservoir exponent and identifying the transition to a\\nsuccessful reconstruction. Applying this method to both synthetic and\\nreal-world datasets, including financial time series, we demonstrate its\\npractical viability. Finally, we transfer these insights to classical RC by\\naugmenting traditional architectures with fractional, generalized reservoir\\nstates. This yields performance gains, particularly in resource-constrained\\nscenarios such as physical reservoirs, where increasing reservoir size is\\nimpractical or economically unviable. Our work provides a principled route\\ntoward tailoring RCs to the intrinsic complexity of the systems they aim to\\nmodel.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,nlin.CD\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T12:47:21Z\"}"}
