Here, we investigate the expected impact conditions from N-body\\nsimulations. We then use state-of-the-art SPH simulations to investigate the\\nresults of impacts with different conditions including various impactor masses\\nand composition, different formation stages in Jupiter's growth, and different\\nresolutions. We next simulate the long-term thermal evolution of Jupiter\\npost-impact. We find that N-body simulations predict rather oblique impacts,\\nand that head-on collisions are rare. Moreover, our results show that even\\nunder a head-on collision, Jupiter's fuzzy core cannot be formed. We next\\nsimulated Jupiter's thermal evolution and showed that unless post-impact\\ntemperatures are extremely low, a giant impact would not lead to an extended\\ndilute core as inferred by interior models. We conclude that Jupiter's fuzzy\\ncore is not caused by an impact and is likely to be an outcome of its formation\\nprocess.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T12:20:59Z\"}"}
