We compare a replicated\\ndataset of 970,919 tweets from 2020 (pre-ChatGPT) with 20,000 tweets from the\\nsame period in 2024, all of which mention Donald Trump during election periods.\\nUsing a combination of Flesch-Kincaid readability and polarity scores, we\\nanalyze changes in text complexity and sentiment. Our findings reveal a\\nsignificant increase in mean sentiment polarity (0.12 vs. 0.04) and a shift\\nfrom predominantly neutral content (54.8% in 2020 to 39.8% in 2024) to more\\npositive expressions (28.6% to 45.9%). These findings suggest not only an\\nincreasing presence of AI in social media communication but also its impact on\\nlanguage and emotional expression patterns.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T08:01:38Z\"}"}
