Iterative\\ngraph $H^k_n(G)$ is produced when the preceding constructions are repeated $n$\\ntimes. According to the graph structure, we obtain a set of linear equations,\\nand derive the entirely normalized Laplacian spectrum of $H^k_n(G)$ when $k =\\n1$ and $k \\\\geqslant 2$ respectively by analyzing the structure of the solutions\\nof these linear equations. We find significant formulas to calculate the\\nKemeny's constant, multiplicative degree-Kirchhoff index and number of spanning\\ntrees of $H^k_n(G)$ as applications.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T09:27:36Z\"}"}
