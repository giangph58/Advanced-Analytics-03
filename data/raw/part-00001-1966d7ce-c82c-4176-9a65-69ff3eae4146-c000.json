{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05038v1\", \"title\": \"Uncertainty-Aware Scarf Plots\", \"summary\": \"Multiple challenges emerge when analyzing eye-tracking data with areas of\\ninterest (AOIs) because recordings are subject to different sources of\\nuncertainties. Previous work often presents gaze data without considering those\\ninaccuracies in the data. To address this issue, we developed uncertainty-aware\\nscarf plot visualizations that aim to make analysts aware of uncertainties with\\nrespect to the position-based mapping of gaze to AOIs and depth dependency in\\n3D scenes. Additionally, we also consider uncertainties in automatic AOI\\nannotation. We showcase our approach in comparison to standard scarf plots in\\nan augmented reality scenario.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T08:17:58Z\"}"}
