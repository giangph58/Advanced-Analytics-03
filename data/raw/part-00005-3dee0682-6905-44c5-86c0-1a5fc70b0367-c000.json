{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00293v1\", \"title\": \"Reducing Sexual Predation and Victimization Through Warnings and\\n  Awareness among High-Risk Users\", \"summary\": \"Online sexual predators target children by building trust, creating\\ndependency, and arranging meetings for sexual purposes. This poses a\\nsignificant challenge for online communication platforms that strive to monitor\\nand remove such content and terminate predators' accounts. However, these\\nplatforms can only take such actions if sexual predators explicitly violate the\\nterms of service, not during the initial stages of relationship-building. This\\nstudy designed and evaluated a strategy to prevent sexual predation and\\nvictimization by delivering warnings and raising awareness among high-risk\\nindividuals based on the routine activity theory in criminal psychology. We\\nidentified high-risk users as those with a high probability of committing or\\nbeing subjected to violations, using a machine learning model that analyzed\\nsocial networks and monitoring data from the platform. We conducted a\\nrandomized controlled trial on a Japanese avatar-based communication\\napplication, Pigg Party. High-risk players in the intervention group received\\nwarnings and awareness-building messages, while those in the control group did\\nnot receive the messages, regardless of their risk level. The trial involved\\n12,842 high-risk players in the intervention group and 12,844 in the control\\ngroup for 138 days. The intervention successfully reduced violations and being\\nviolated among women for 12 weeks, although the impact on men was limited.\\nThese findings contribute to efforts to combat online sexual abuse and advance\\nunderstanding of criminal psychology.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SI\", \"categories\": \"cs.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T04:32:27Z\"}"}
