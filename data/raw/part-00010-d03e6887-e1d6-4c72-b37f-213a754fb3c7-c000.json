{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19823v1\", \"title\": \"A nonlinear diffusion equation of the Gurtin-MacCamy type: existence,\\n  uniqueness, and numerical simulations\", \"summary\": \"This paper examines a nonlinear diffusion process that arises in the modeling\\nof biological population dynamics and extends to applications in thermal\\ndiffusion and material sciences. By investigating a power-law governed\\ndiffusion mechanism coupled with a time-dependent growth rate, we establish the\\nexistence and uniqueness of solutions to the associated boundary-value problem\\nwithin a bounded domain. Our approach departs from traditional methods by\\ntransforming the original problem into a simplified elliptic framework, which\\nnot only facilitates rigorous theoretical analysis but also paves the way for\\nefficient numerical simulations. In addition to the analytical results, we\\ndevelop a numerical scheme implemented in Python to visualize the evolution of\\nthe population density across time and space. These simulations confirm the\\ntheoretical predictions and demonstrate the model's sensitivity to variations\\nin the nonlinear exponent, growth rate, and other parameters. The\\ninterdisciplinary nature of our work suggests that the insights gained from the\\nstudy of nonlinear diffusion may have far-reaching implications, ranging from\\nthe control of microbial populations in biomedical contexts to the analysis of\\nenergy transport in advanced materials. Overall, our findings contribute to a\\ndeeper understanding of complex diffusion phenomena and offer a novel\\ncomputational framework that can be adapted to a wide range of scientific and\\nengineering problems.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:23:24Z\"}"}
