While\\nBBPT has demonstrated considerable potential, it is often found that many\\nexisting methods require an excessive number of queries (i.e., function\\nevaluations), which poses a significant challenge in real-world scenarios where\\nthe number of allowed queries is limited. To tackle this issue, we propose\\nZeroth-order Intrinsic-dimensional Prompt-tuning (ZIP), a novel approach that\\nenables efficient and robust prompt optimization in a purely black-box setting.\\nThe key idea of ZIP is to reduce the problem dimensionality and the variance of\\nzeroth-order gradient estimates, such that the training is done fast with far\\nless queries. We achieve this by re-parameterizing prompts in low-rank\\nrepresentations and designing intrinsic-dimensional clipping of estimated\\ngradients. We evaluate ZIP on 13+ vision-language tasks in standard benchmarks\\nand show that it achieves an average improvement of approximately 6% in\\nfew-shot accuracy and 48% in query efficiency compared to the best-performing\\nalternative BBPT methods, establishing a new state of the art. Our ablation\\nanalysis further shows that the proposed clipping mechanism is robust and\\nnearly optimal, without the need to manually select the clipping threshold,\\nmatching the result of expensive hyperparameter search.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T12:56:22Z\"}"}
