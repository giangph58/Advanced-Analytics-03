{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04582v1\", \"title\": \"Ponderomotive-expulsion: toward creating an electron-free volume\", \"summary\": \"We describe a demonstration of a prototype approach to clear the laser focal\\nvolume of free electrons and disable their atomic and molecular sources.\\nEmploying two temporally separated, copropagating pulses, we exploited a\\npump-probe setup in our experiment. The pump ionized a low-density gas and\\nexpelled free and nascent electrons from its focal volume. The probe,\\ntraversing the same focal volume, expelled any remaining free and probe-induced\\nnascent electrons. We gauged the effectiveness of the approach by capturing the\\nspatial distribution of ejected electrons with image plates while we varied the\\nrelative intensity and time delay between the pump and probe. When we injected\\nthe pump 300 fs before the probe, we found the electron spatial distribution\\nsignificantly altered and the yield suppressed, proving ponderomotive expulsion\\nworks. However, the yield was enhanced when we set the temporal spacing between\\nthe pump and probe to 150 fs. Simulations show the enhancement is due to Airy\\nrings of the focused pump expelling electrons inward toward the propagation\\naxis. Our results show that the complete removal of focal-volume electrons was\\ninhibited by spatial overlap fluctuations and the stronger probe generating\\nionization outside the cleared-volume of the pump. We discuss ways to mitigate\\nthese impediments and propose alternate two-beam arrangements to achieve more\\nefficient focal-volume clearing.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det,physics.app-ph,physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T17:21:32Z\"}"}
