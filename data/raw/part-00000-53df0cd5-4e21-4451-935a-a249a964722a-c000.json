{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05308v1\", \"title\": \"Safe Individualized Treatment Rules with Controllable Harm Rates\", \"summary\": \"Estimating individualized treatment rules (ITRs) is crucial for tailoring\\ninterventions in precision medicine. Typical ITR estimation methods rely on\\nconditional average treatment effects (CATEs) to guide treatment assignments.\\nHowever, such methods overlook individual-level harm within covariate-specific\\nsubpopulations, potentially leading many individuals to experience worse\\noutcomes under CATE-based ITRs. In this article, we aim to estimate ITRs that\\nmaximize the reward while ensuring that the harm rate induced by the ITR\\nremains below a pre-specified threshold. We derive the explicit form of the\\noptimal ITR, propose a plug-in estimator when both the CATE and harm rate are\\nidentifiable, and establish the large-sample properties of the proposed\\nestimator. Given that the harm rate is generally unidentifiable due to its\\ndependence on the joint distribution of potential outcomes, we further propose\\n{three} strategies for estimating ITRs with a controllable harm rate under\\npartial identification. By accounting for both reward and harm, our method\\noffers a reliable solution for developing ITRs in high-stakes domains where\\nharm is crucial. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the\\nproposed methods in controlling harm rates. We apply the method to the Right\\nHeart Catheterization dataset, assessing the potential reduction in harm rate\\ncompared to historical interventions.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:54:55Z\"}"}
