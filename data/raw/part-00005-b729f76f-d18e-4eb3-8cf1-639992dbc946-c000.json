The set of admissible controls is characterized by $u\\\\in L^p(I,U)$,\\n$1<p<\\\\infty$, $I=[0,\\\\nu]$, where $U$ is a uniformly convex Banach space.\\nAssuming partial null controllability for the fractional-order linear system\\nwith a source term, we employ an approximate solvability method to simplify the\\nproblem to reduce it to finite-dimensional subspaces. Consequently, the\\nsolutions of the original problem are obtained as limiting functions within\\nthese subspaces. The paper tackles a challenge stemming from the assumption\\nthat $U$ is a uniformly convex Banach space, which introduces convexity issues\\nin constructing the required control. These complications do not occur if $U$\\nis a separable Hilbert space. This study introduces a novel approach by\\nresolving the convexity issue, thereby enabling $L^p(I, U)$ partially null\\ncontrollability of the semilinear fractional-order differential control system,\\nwith $U$ being a uniformly convex Banach space.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,math.CA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T12:29:17Z\"}"}
