From our analysis, we articulate when and why forces are needed,\\nand highlight opportunities to improve learning of contact-rich, generalist\\nrobot policies on the path toward highly capable touch-based robot foundation\\nmodels. We generally find that while there are few tasks such as pouring,\\npeg-in-hole insertion, and handling delicate objects, the performance of\\nimitation learning models is not at a level of dynamics where force truly\\nmatters. Also, force and touch are abstract quantities that can be inferred\\nthrough a wide range of modalities and are often measured and controlled\\nimplicitly. We hope that juxtaposing the different approaches currently in use\\nwill help the reader to gain a systemic understanding and help inspire the next\\ngeneration of robot foundation models.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T07:24:13Z\"}"}
