Our main result give lower\\nbounds for the generalization error of the kernel interpolation measured in a\\ncontinuous scale of norms that interpolate between $L^2$ and the hypothesis\\nspace. These lower bounds imply that kernel interpolation is always\\ninconsistent, when the smoothness index of the norm is larger than a constant\\nthat depends only on the embedding index of the hypothesis space and the decay\\nrate of the eigenvalues.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ML\", \"categories\": \"stat.ML,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T10:35:12Z\"}"}
