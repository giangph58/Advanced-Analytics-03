The\\nmodel used for prediction in MPC is augmented with a disturbance term, that is\\nestimated by an observer. If the full information about the equilibrium of the\\nreal system is not available, a reference calculator is introduced in the\\nalgorithm to compute the MPC state and input references. The control algorithm\\nguarantees offset-free tracking of the controlled output under the assumption\\nthat the modeling errors are asymptotically constant. The effectiveness of the\\nproposed approach is showcased with numerical simulations for two popular\\nbenchmark systems: the van-der-Pol oscillator and the four-tanks process.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T08:00:15Z\"}"}
