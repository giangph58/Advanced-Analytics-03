{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21617v1\", \"title\": \"Sensitivity Analysis for Clustered Observational Studies with an\\n  Application to the Effectiveness of Magnet Nursing Hospitals\", \"summary\": \"In a clustered observational study, treatment is assigned to groups and all\\nunits within the group are exposed to the treatment. Here, we use a clustered\\nobservational study (COS) design to estimate the effectiveness of Magnet\\nNursing certificates for emergency surgery patients. Recent research has\\nintroduced specialized weighting estimators for the COS design that balance\\nbaseline covariates at the unit and cluster level. These methods allow\\nresearchers to adjust for observed confounders, but are sensitive to unobserved\\nconfounding. In this paper, we develop new sensitivity analysis methods\\ntailored to weighting estimators for COS designs. We provide several key\\ncontributions. First, we introduce a key bias decomposition, tailored to the\\nspecific confounding structure that arises in a COS. Second, we develop a\\nsensitivity framework for weighted COS designs that constrain the error in the\\nunderlying weights. We introduce both a marginal sensitivity model and a\\nvariance-based sensitivity model, and extend both to accommodate multiple\\nestimands. Finally, we propose amplification and benchmarking methods to better\\ninterpret the results. Throughout, we illustrate our proposed methods by\\nanalyzing the effectiveness of Magnet nursing hospitals.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T13:13:37Z\"}"}
