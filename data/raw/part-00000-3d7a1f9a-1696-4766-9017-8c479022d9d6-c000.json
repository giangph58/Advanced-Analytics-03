{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11202v1\", \"title\": \"Focal Split: Untethered Snapshot Depth from Differential Defocus\", \"summary\": \"We introduce Focal Split, a handheld, snapshot depth camera with fully\\nonboard power and computing based on depth-from-differential-defocus (DfDD).\\nFocal Split is passive, avoiding power consumption of light sources. Its\\nachromatic optical system simultaneously forms two differentially defocused\\nimages of the scene, which can be independently captured using two photosensors\\nin a snapshot. The data processing is based on the DfDD theory, which\\nefficiently computes a depth and a confidence value for each pixel with only\\n500 floating point operations (FLOPs) per pixel from the camera measurements.\\nWe demonstrate a Focal Split prototype, which comprises a handheld custom\\ncamera system connected to a Raspberry Pi 5 for real-time data processing. The\\nsystem consumes 4.9 W and is powered on a 5 V, 10,000 mAh battery. The\\nprototype can measure objects with distances from 0.4 m to 1.2 m, outputting\\n480$\\\\times$360 sparse depth maps at 2.1 frames per second (FPS) using\\nunoptimized Python scripts. Focal Split is DIY friendly. A comprehensive guide\\nto building your own Focal Split depth camera, code, and additional data can be\\nfound at https://focal-split.qiguo.org.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,eess.IV,eess.SP,I.4.8\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:01:36Z\"}"}
