{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03737v1\", \"title\": \"Impact of Galactic non-Gaussian foregrounds on CMB lensing measurements\", \"summary\": \"Weak gravitational lensing of the CMB has been established as a robust and\\npowerful observable for precision cosmology. However, the impact of Galactic\\nforegrounds, which has been studied less extensively than many other potential\\nsystematics, could in principle pose a problem for CMB lensing measurements.\\nThese foregrounds are inherently non-Gaussian and hence might mimic the\\ncharacteristic signal that lensing estimators are designed to measure. We\\npresent an analysis that quantifies the level of contamination from Galactic\\ndust in lensing measurements, focusing particularly on measurements with the\\nAtacama Cosmology Telescope and the Simons Observatory. We employ a whole suite\\nof foreground models and study the contamination of lensing measurements with\\nboth individual frequency channels and multifrequency combinations. We test the\\nsensitivity of different estimators to the level of foreground non-Gaussianity,\\nand the dependence on sky fraction and multipole range used. We find that\\nGalactic foregrounds do not present a problem for the Atacama Cosmology\\nTelescope experiment (the bias in the inferred CMB lensing power spectrum\\namplitude remains below $0.3\\\\sigma$). For Simons Observatory, not all\\nforeground models remain below this threshold. Although our results are\\nconservative upper limits, they suggest that further work on characterizing\\ndust biases and determining the impact of mitigation methods is well motivated,\\nespecially for the largest sky fractions.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T17:59:45Z\"}"}
