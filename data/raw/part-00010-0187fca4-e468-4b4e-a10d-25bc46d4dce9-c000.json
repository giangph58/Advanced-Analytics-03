Notably, unlike in\\nthe Einstein--Maxwell case, the massless neutral scalar field equation here is\\nfully separable into radial and angular parts. This separability reveals a\\nhidden conformal symmetry in the near--horizon, low--frequency regime,\\nproviding further support for the robustness of Kerr/CFT dualities in extended\\ngravitational theories.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T09:33:54Z\"}"}
