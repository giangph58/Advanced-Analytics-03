For systems with a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, it is a\\nfundamental property of the Liouvillian, that the real-parts of all its\\neigenvalues are non-positive which, in physical terms, corresponds to the\\nstability of the system. The usual argument for this property is indirect,\\nusing that $\\\\mathcal{L}$ generates a quantum channel and that quantum channels\\nare contractive. We provide a direct algebraic proof based on the Lindblad form\\nof Liouvillians.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T03:54:25Z\"}"}
