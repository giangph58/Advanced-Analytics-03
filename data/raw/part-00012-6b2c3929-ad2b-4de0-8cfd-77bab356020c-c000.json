{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03618v1\", \"title\": \"Scalable Class-Centric Visual Interactive Labeling\", \"summary\": \"Large unlabeled datasets demand efficient and scalable data labeling\\nsolutions, in particular when the number of instances and classes is large.\\nThis leads to significant visual scalability challenges and imposes a high\\ncognitive load on the users. Traditional instance-centric labeling methods,\\nwhere (single) instances are labeled in each iteration struggle to scale\\neffectively in these scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce cVIL,\\na Class-Centric Visual Interactive Labeling methodology designed for\\ninteractive visual data labeling. By shifting the paradigm from\\nassigning-classes-to-instances to assigning-instances-to-classes, cVIL reduces\\nlabeling effort and enhances efficiency for annotators working with large,\\ncomplex and class-rich datasets. We propose a novel visual analytics labeling\\ninterface built on top of the conceptual cVIL workflow, enabling improved\\nscalability over traditional visual labeling. In a user study, we demonstrate\\nthat cVIL can improve labeling efficiency and user satisfaction over\\ninstance-centric interfaces. The effectiveness of cVIL is further demonstrated\\nthrough a usage scenario, showcasing its potential to alleviate cognitive load\\nand support experts in managing extensive labeling tasks efficiently.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:16:46Z\"}"}
