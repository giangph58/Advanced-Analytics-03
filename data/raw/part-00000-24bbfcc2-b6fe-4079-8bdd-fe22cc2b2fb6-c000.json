The explicit field equations were\\nformulated by considering a minimum model of this extended gravity. Basically,\\nthe Darmois junction conditions are used to determine the unknown constants of\\nmetric coefficients. We explore some significant properties of the compact\\nstars under consideration to check their viable existence in this modified\\nframework. The Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation assess the equilibrium state\\nof the compact stars. Moreover, the stability analysis is defined by using\\nmethods based on sound speed (related to how disturbances propagate in the\\nstar) and adiabatic index (related to the thermodynamic behavior of the star).\\nWe find that the proposed compact stars in the $f(\\\\mathbb{Q}, \\\\mathbb{T})$\\ngravity are physically viable and stable.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T06:17:11Z\"}"}
