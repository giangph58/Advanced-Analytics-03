{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00617v1\", \"title\": \"The equations of Einstein and Cartan\", \"summary\": \"A formulation of Einstein's gravitational field equations in four space-time\\ndimensions is presented using generalized differential forms and Cartan's\\nequations for metric geometries. Cartan's structure equations are extended by\\nusing generalized metric connections. They are then employed to represent\\nEinstein's field equations and their solutions. When the energy-momentum tensor\\nis zero the generalized connections can be chosen to be flat and different\\nsolutions of Einstein's equations can be related by generalizations of the\\nPoincar\\\\'e group. An action for the vacuum field equations is constructed by\\ngeneralizing the Nieh-Yan three-form.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T15:48:19Z\"}"}
