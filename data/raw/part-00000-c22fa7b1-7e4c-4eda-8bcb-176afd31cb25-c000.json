{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04850v1\", \"title\": \"An Efficient Approach for Cooperative Multi-Agent Learning Problems\", \"summary\": \"In this article, we propose a centralized Multi-Agent Learning framework for\\nlearning a policy that models the simultaneous behavior of multiple agents that\\nneed to coordinate to solve a certain task. Centralized approaches often suffer\\nfrom the explosion of an action space that is defined by all possible\\ncombinations of individual actions, known as joint actions. Our approach\\naddresses the coordination problem via a sequential abstraction, which\\novercomes the scalability problems typical to centralized methods. It\\nintroduces a meta-agent, called \\\\textit{supervisor}, which abstracts joint\\nactions as sequential assignments of actions to each agent. This sequential\\nabstraction not only simplifies the centralized joint action space but also\\nenhances the framework's scalability and efficiency. Our experimental results\\ndemonstrate that the proposed approach successfully coordinates agents across a\\nvariety of Multi-Agent Learning environments of diverse sizes.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T09:03:35Z\"}"}
