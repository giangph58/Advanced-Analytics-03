{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15747v1\", \"title\": \"Lattice surgery-based logical state teleportation via noisy links\", \"summary\": \"For planar architectures surface code-based quantum error correction is one\\nof the most promising approaches to fault-tolerant quantum computation. This is\\npartially due to the variety of fault-tolerant logical protocols that can be\\nimplemented in two dimensions using local operations. One such protocol is the\\nlattice surgery-based logical state teleportation, which transfers a logical\\nquantum state from an initial location on a quantum chip to a target location\\nthrough a linking region of qubits. This protocol serves as a basis for\\nhigher-level routines, such as the entangling CNOT gate or magic state\\ninjection. In this work we investigate the correctability phase diagram of this\\nprotocol for distinct error rates inside the surface code patches and within\\nthe linking region. We adopt techniques from statistical physics to describe\\nthe numerically observed crossover regime between correctable and uncorrectable\\nquantum error correction phases, where the correctability depends on the\\nseparation between the initial and target locations. We find that inside the\\ncrossover regime the correctability-threshold lines decay as a power law with\\nincreasing separation, which we explain accurately using a finite-size scaling\\nanalysis. Our results indicate that the logical state teleportation protocol\\ncan tolerate much higher noise rates in the linking region compared to the bulk\\nof the surface code patches, provided the separation between the positions is\\nrelatively small.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T09:49:03Z\"}"}
