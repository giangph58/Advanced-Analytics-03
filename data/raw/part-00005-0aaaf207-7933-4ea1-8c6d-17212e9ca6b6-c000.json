{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10274v1\", \"title\": \"Large magnetoreflectance and optical anisotropy due to $4f$ flat bands\\n  in the frustrated kagome magnet HoAgGe\", \"summary\": \"We report peculiar optical properties of the frustrated itinerant magnet\\nHoAgGe, which exhibits multiple magnetically ordered states obeying the kagome\\nspin-ice rule. The optical conductivity is surprisingly higher for light\\npolarization perpendicular to the kagome plane, both for the free carrier\\nresponse and the interband transitions. The latter ones have strong\\ncontributions from Ho $4f$ flat bands located near the Fermi level, as revealed\\nby our \\\\textit{ab initio} calculations, explaining the unusual anisotropy of\\nthe optical properties and the pronounced temperature dependence of the\\ninterband transitions for out--of--plane light polarization. The key role of Ho\\n$4f$ states is further supported by the large variation of the reflectivity\\nupon the metamagnetic transitions, that follows the field dependence of the\\nmagnetization, in contrast to that of the dc magnetotransport data. Such\\nheavy-electron bands near the Fermi level offer an efficient way to control\\ntransport and optical properties.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T14:40:56Z\"}"}
