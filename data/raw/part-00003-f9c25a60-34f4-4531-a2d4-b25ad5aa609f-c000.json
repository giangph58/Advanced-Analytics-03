The study\\nuses analytical methods to examine how these factors influence the emergence of\\nnonreciprocity and azimuthal standing waves in nanotubes with longitudinal\\nmagnetization along the axis or with a vortex-like magnetization. The interplay\\nbetween exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya, and dipolar couplings in determining\\nthe chirality of spin waves is discussed. When the magnetization is saturated\\nalong an axis, the spin waves propagating along it are symmetric under the\\ninversion of the wave vector. However, magnetochirality, mainly driven by\\nexchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya couplings, is observed in the azimuthal\\nstanding modes. In the vortex state, frequency nonreciprocity occurs for waves\\npropagating along the tube, while the azimuthal modes remain reciprocal. For\\npositive Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and depending on the helicity of\\nthe vortex, the asymmetry induced by the dipolar interaction is reinforced,\\nwhereas a negative coupling opposes this asymmetry. The influence of radial\\nanisotropy is also examined. It is found that radial anisotropy reduces the\\nfrequency of the modes and shifts the dispersion minimum to a finite wave\\nvector in the vortex state. The properties of modes near zero frequency offer\\ninsight into the emergence of chiral magnetic textures.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T16:13:20Z\"}"}
