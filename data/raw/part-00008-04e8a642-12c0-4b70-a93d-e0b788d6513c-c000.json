Although hierarchical model predictive control offers favorable\\nproperties, achieving a provably safe, yet modular design remains a challenge.\\nThis paper introduces a contract-based hierarchical control strategy to improve\\nthe performance of control systems facing challenges related to model\\ninconsistency and independent controller design across hierarchies. We consider\\na setup where a higher-level controller generates references that affect the\\nconstraints of a lower-level controller, which is based on a soft-constrained\\nMPC formulation. The optimal slack variables serve as the basis for a contract\\nthat allows the higher-level controller to assess the feasibility of the\\nreference trajectory without exact knowledge of the model, constraints, and\\ncost of the lower-level controller. To ensure computational efficiency while\\nmaintaining model confidentiality, we propose using an explicit function\\napproximation, such as a neural network, to represent the cost of optimal slack\\nvalues. The approach is tested for a hierarchical control setup consisting of a\\nplanner and a motion controller as commonly found in autonomous driving.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T12:51:18Z\"}"}
