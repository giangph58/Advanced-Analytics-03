{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15717v1\", \"title\": \"Trusted Compute Units: A Framework for Chained Verifiable Computations\", \"summary\": \"Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) facilitate\\ndecentralized computations across trust boundaries. However, ensuring complex\\ncomputations with low gas fees and confidentiality remains challenging. Recent\\nadvances in Confidential Computing -- leveraging hardware-based Trusted\\nExecution Environments (TEEs) -- and Proof-carrying Data -- employing\\ncryptographic Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machines (zkVMs) -- hold promise for\\nsecure, privacy-preserving off-chain and layer-2 computations.On the other\\nside, a homogeneous reliance on a single technology, such as TEEs or zkVMs, is\\nimpractical for decentralized environments with heterogeneous computational\\nrequirements. This paper introduces the Trusted Compute Unit (TCU), a unifying\\nframework that enables composable and interoperable verifiable computations\\nacross heterogeneous technologies. Our approach allows decentralized\\napplications (dApps) to flexibly offload complex computations to TCUs,\\nobtaining proof of correctness. These proofs can be anchored on-chain for\\nautomated dApp interactions, while ensuring confidentiality of input data, and\\nintegrity of output data. We demonstrate how TCUs can support a prominent\\nblockchain use case, such as federated learning. By enabling secure off-chain\\ninteractions without incurring on-chain confirmation delays or gas fees, TCUs\\nsignificantly improve system performance and scalability. Experimental insights\\nand performance evaluations confirm the feasibility and practicality of this\\nunified approach, advancing the state of the art in verifiable off-chain\\nservices for the blockchain ecosystem.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T09:01:55Z\"}"}
