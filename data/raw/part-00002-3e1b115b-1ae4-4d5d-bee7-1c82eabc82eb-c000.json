People learn these structures from examples - a process known in\\ncognitive science as schema induction. However, inducing schemas is\\nchallenging, as structural patterns are often obscured by surface-level\\nvariation. We present Schemex, an interactive visual workflow that scaffolds\\nschema induction through clustering, abstraction, and contrastive refinement.\\nSchemex supports users through visual representations and interactive\\nexploration that connect abstract structures to concrete examples, promoting\\ntransparency, adaptability, and effective human-AI collaboration. In our user\\nstudy, participants reported significantly greater insight and confidence in\\nthe schemas developed with Schemex compared to those created using a baseline\\nof an AI reasoning model. We conclude by discussing the broader implications of\\nstructural abstraction and contrastive refinement across domains.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T06:02:31Z\"}"}
