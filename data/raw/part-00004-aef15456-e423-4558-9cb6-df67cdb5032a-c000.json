The resulting superconducting state has an\\nupper critical field far greater than the superconducting transition\\ntemperature, and with spin-orbit coupling, it is sensitive to the field\\norientation. We demonstrate the interplay between superconductivity and\\nmetamagnetism in a simple effective theory.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T17:58:57Z\"}"}
