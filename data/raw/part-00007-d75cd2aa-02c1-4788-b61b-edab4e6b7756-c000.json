We\\npresent different regularity results and prove a verification theorem that\\nshows that the solution produced via the Feynman-Kac theorem is the unique\\nviscosity solution for a wide choice of initial data (even discontinuous) and\\nsource data. In addition, our techniques do not use Feller's condition at any\\ntime. In the end, we prove a convergence theorem to approximate this solution\\nby means of a hybrid (finite differences/tree scheme) approach.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,cs.NA,math.NA,q-fin.CP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:50:06Z\"}"}
