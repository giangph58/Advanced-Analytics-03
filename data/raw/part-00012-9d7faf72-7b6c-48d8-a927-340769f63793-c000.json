A Support\\nVector Machine (SVM) model is implemented and compared against conventional\\ndetection methods. The proposed approach improves preamble index assignment,\\nenhancing detection efficiency for User Equipment (UE) accessing the network.\\nPerformance analysis demonstrates that the SVM-based solution increases\\ndetection accuracy while reducing missed detections. These findings underscore\\nthe potential of machine learning in optimizing the Random Access procedure and\\nimproving network accessibility.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP,40-06\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T07:15:50Z\"}"}
