With\\nthree different first-excitation transitions, 357.971 nm, 359.451 nm, and\\n360.636 nm, automated continuous laser-frequency scans using a\\nfrequency-doubled, grating-tuned Ti:Sa laser were performed. Rydberg series as\\nwell as autoionizing(AI) states were observed. From these results, the\\nionization potential (IP) of Cr was determined as\\n54575.49(2)$_\\\\text{stat}$(2)$_\\\\text{sys}$ cm$^{-1}$, which is one order of\\nmagnitude more precise than the previously reported 54575.6(3) cm$^{-1}$ in\\nNIST database. The ionization scheme using the observed AI resonance, with\\n357.971 nm as the first step and 373.935 nm as the second step was subsequently\\ndeployed to the online delivery of radioactive Cr isotope beams for precision\\nmass measurements. The online yields of $^{50-59}$Cr have been measured at\\nTRIUMF-ISAC.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph,physics.acc-ph,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T17:46:56Z\"}"}
