In this study, we investigate how terminal molecular groups influence\\nthe formation and stability of polar phases by analyzing six compounds from\\nthree homologous series. Specifically, we compare newly synthesized homologs\\nwith a nitro group, which predominantly exhibit polar mesophases, to previously\\nreported structurally related analogs containing either a cyano group or a\\nfluorine atom as terminal fragment. Density Functional Theory (DFT)\\ncalculations provide insights into electronic surface potential (ESP)\\ndistributions, revealing alternating regions of positive and negative charge\\ndensity along the molecular axis, consistent with Madhusudana model of polar\\nphase stabilization. We propose the ESP-derived parameter quantifying terminal\\nelectrostatic charge, revealing a direct correlation between the negative to\\npositive charge ratio at the molecular termini and the formation of\\nferroelectric or antiferroelectric mesophases. To validate this hypothesis, we\\nanalyze the molecular structure-mesomorphic behavior relationship of other\\nknown non-chiral compounds that exhibit polar phases, demonstrating the\\ncritical role of terminal groups in determining mesophase polarity. Our\\nfindings enhance the understanding of the molecular origins of ferroelectricity\\nin non-chiral LCs, paving the way for the rational design of next-generation\\nfunctional polar soft materials.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T15:22:39Z\"}"}
