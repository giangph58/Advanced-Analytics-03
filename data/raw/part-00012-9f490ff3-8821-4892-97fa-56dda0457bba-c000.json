We apply our method to build the first\\nknowledge graph of nuclear fusion energy, a highly specialized field\\ncharacterized by vast scope and heterogeneity. This is an ideal benchmark to\\ntest the key features of our pipeline, including automatic named entity\\nrecognition and entity resolution. We show how pre-trained large language\\nmodels can be used to address these challenges and we evaluate their\\nperformance against Zipf's law, which characterizes human-generated natural\\nlanguage. Additionally, we develop a knowledge-graph retrieval-augmented\\ngeneration system that combines large language models with a multi-prompt\\napproach. This system provides contextually relevant answers to\\nnatural-language queries, including complex multi-hop questions that require\\nreasoning across interconnected entities.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T13:29:58Z\"}"}
