{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21620v1\", \"title\": \"Deterministic Distributed DFS via Cycle Separators in Planar Graphs\", \"summary\": \"One of the most basic techniques in algorithm design consists of breaking a\\nproblem into subproblems and then proceeding recursively. In the case of graph\\nalgorithms, one way to implement this approach is through separator sets. Given\\na graph $G=(V,E)$, a subset of nodes $S \\\\subseteq V$ is called a separator set\\nof $G$ if the size of each connected component of $G-S$ is at most $2/3 \\\\cdot\\n|V|$. The most useful separator sets are those that satisfy certain\\nrestrictions of cardinality or structure. For over 40 years, various efficient\\nalgorithms have been developed for computing separators of different kinds,\\nparticularly in planar graphs. Separator sets, combined with a divide and\\nconquer approach, have been fundamental in the design of efficient algorithms\\nin various settings.\\n  In this work, we present the first deterministic algorithm in the distributed\\nCONGEST model that recursively computes a cycle separator over planar graphs in\\n$\\\\tilde{O}(D)$ rounds. This result, as in the centralized setting, has\\nsignificant implications in the area of distributed planar algorithms. In fact,\\nfrom this result, we can construct a deterministic algorithm that computes a\\nDFS tree in ${\\\\tilde{O}}(D)$ rounds. This matches both the best-known\\nrandomized algorithm of Ghaffari and Parter (DISC, 2017) and, up to\\npolylogarithmic factors, the trivial lower bound of $\\\\Omega(D)$ rounds.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T13:21:12Z\"}"}
