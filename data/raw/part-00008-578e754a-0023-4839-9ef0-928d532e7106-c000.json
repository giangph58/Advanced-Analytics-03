{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15975v1\", \"title\": \"A New Graph Grammar Formalism for Robust Syntactic Pattern Recognition\", \"summary\": \"I introduce a formalism for representing the syntax of recursively structured\\ngraph-like patterns. It does not use production rules, like a conventional\\ngraph grammar, but represents the syntactic structure in a more direct and\\ndeclarative way. The grammar and the pattern are both represented as networks,\\nand parsing is seen as the construction of a homomorphism from the pattern to\\nthe grammar. The grammars can represent iterative, hierarchical and nested\\nrecursive structure in more than one dimension.\\n  This supports a highly parallel style of parsing, in which all aspects of\\npattern recognition (feature detection, segmentation, parsing, filling in\\nmissing symbols, top-down and bottom-up inference) are integrated into a single\\nprocess, to exploit the synergy between them.\\n  The emphasis of this paper is on underlying theoretical issues, but I also\\ngive some example runs to illustrate the error-tolerant parsing of complex\\nrecursively structured patterns of 50-1000 symbols, involving variability in\\ngeometric relationships, blurry and indistinct symbols, overlapping symbols,\\ncluttered images, and erased patches.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.FL\", \"categories\": \"cs.FL,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T15:23:37Z\"}"}
