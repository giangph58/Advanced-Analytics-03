We give new proofs of earlier results of Lorenzini\\nand Obus-Wewers, and resolve a question of Lorenzini on the Euler\\ncharacteristic of the resolution graph of a $p$-cyclic arithmetic surface\\nquotient singularity. Our method consists of constructing a simultaneous\\nskeleton for the associated cover of Berkovich analytifications and applying a\\nskeletal Riemann-Hurwitz formula.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT,math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T09:19:26Z\"}"}
