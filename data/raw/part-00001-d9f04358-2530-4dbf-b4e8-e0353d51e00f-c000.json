{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15138v1\", \"title\": \"Automatic Generation of Aerobatic Flight in Complex Environments via\\n  Diffusion Models\", \"summary\": \"Performing striking aerobatic flight in complex environments demands manual\\ndesigns of key maneuvers in advance, which is intricate and time-consuming as\\nthe horizon of the trajectory performed becomes long. This paper presents a\\nnovel framework that leverages diffusion models to automate and scale up\\naerobatic trajectory generation. Our key innovation is the decomposition of\\ncomplex maneuvers into aerobatic primitives, which are short frame sequences\\nthat act as building blocks, featuring critical aerobatic behaviors for\\ntractable trajectory synthesis. The model learns aerobatic primitives using\\nhistorical trajectory observations as dynamic priors to ensure motion\\ncontinuity, with additional conditional inputs (target waypoints and optional\\naction constraints) integrated to enable user-editable trajectory generation.\\nDuring model inference, classifier guidance is incorporated with batch sampling\\nto achieve obstacle avoidance. Additionally, the generated outcomes are refined\\nthrough post-processing with spatial-temporal trajectory optimization to ensure\\ndynamical feasibility. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments have\\nvalidated the key component designs of our method, demonstrating its\\nfeasibility for deploying on real drones to achieve long-horizon aerobatic\\nflight.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T14:40:55Z\"}"}
