This study evaluates\\noptical Sentinel-2 satellite imagery for detecting digestate application, a\\npractice that enhances soil fertility but poses environmental risks like\\nmicroplastic contamination and nitrogen losses. In the first instance,\\nSentinel-2 satellite image time series (SITS) analysis of specific indices\\n(EOMI, NDVI, EVI) was used to characterize EOM's spectral behavior after\\napplication on the soils of four different crop types in Thessaly, Greece.\\nFurthermore, Machine Learning (ML) models (namely Random Forest, k-NN, Gradient\\nBoosting and a Feed-Forward Neural Network), were used to investigate digestate\\npresence detection, achieving F1-scores up to 0.85. The findings highlight the\\npotential of combining remote sensing and ML for scalable and cost-effective\\nmonitoring of EOM applications, supporting precision agriculture and\\nsustainability.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:16:40Z\"}"}
