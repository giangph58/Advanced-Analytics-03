Our method\\nis based on the gradient flow structure of the evolution and captures two\\ndistinct regimes of the dynamics, an initial - and novel - phase of\\nalgebraic-in-time decay and a later - and previously explored - phase of\\nexponential-in-time decay. By quantifying the initial phase of relaxation, our\\nmethod allows for the investigation of systems with large initial dissipation\\nas long as the isoperimetric deficit is small enough. We include quantitative\\nestimates of the solution in terms of its initial data, including the\\n$C^{1}$-distance to the center manifold of circles and the displacement of the\\nbarycenter.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T13:59:28Z\"}"}
