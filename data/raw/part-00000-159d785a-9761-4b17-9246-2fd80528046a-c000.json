{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09974v1\", \"title\": \"Towards Resilient Tracking in Autonomous Vehicles: A Distributionally\\n  Robust Input and State Estimation Approach\", \"summary\": \"This paper proposes a novel framework for the distributionally robust input\\nand state estimation (DRISE) for autonomous vehicles operating under model\\nuncertainties and measurement outliers. The proposed framework improves the\\ninput and state estimation (ISE) approach by integrating distributional\\nrobustness, enhancing the estimator's resilience and robustness to adversarial\\ninputs and unmodeled dynamics. Moment-based ambiguity sets capture\\nprobabilistic uncertainties in both system dynamics and measurement noise,\\noffering analytical tractability and efficiently handling uncertainties in mean\\nand covariance. In particular, the proposed framework minimizes the worst-case\\nestimation error, ensuring robustness against deviations from nominal\\ndistributions. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through\\nsimulations conducted in the CARLA autonomous driving simulator, demonstrating\\nimproved performance in state estimation accuracy and robustness in dynamic and\\nuncertain environments.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T08:26:06Z\"}"}
