This paper tackles the fundamental\\nchallenge of providing outage probability guarantees that remain robust\\nregardless of specific channel or estimation error models. To achieve this, we\\npropose a two-stage framework: (i) construction of a channel uncertainty set\\nusing a generative channel model combined with conformal prediction, and (ii)\\nrobust beamforming via the solution of a min-max optimization problem. The\\nproposed method separates the modeling and optimization tasks, enabling\\nprincipled uncertainty quantification and robust decision-making. Simulation\\nresults confirm the effectiveness and reliability of the framework in achieving\\nmodel-agnostic outage guarantees.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:40:05Z\"}"}
