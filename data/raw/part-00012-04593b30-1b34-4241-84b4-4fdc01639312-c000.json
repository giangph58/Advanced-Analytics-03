The implementation provides a simple API extension for specifying the\\nnumerical precision for individual kernels, and thus allows for testing the\\neffect of low and mixed precision on the accuracy of the solution. To showcase\\nthis, we study the impact of precision on the overall convergence order and\\nactual accuracy of the method as achieved for four common hyperbolic PDE\\nsystems and five relevant scenarios that feature an analytic solution. For all\\nscenarios, we also assess how sensitive each kernel of the ADER-DG algorithm is\\nto using double, single or even half precision. This addresses the question\\nwhere thoughtful adoption of mixed precision can mitigate hurtful effects of\\nlow precision on the overall simulation.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.DS,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:50:43Z\"}"}
