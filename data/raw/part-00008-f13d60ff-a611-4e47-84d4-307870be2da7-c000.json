We derive both the upper and lower\\nbounds for these two constants and establish two equivalent relations between\\nthem. Moreover, we elucidate the relationships between these constants and\\nseveral well-known constants. Additionally, we have refined the value of the\\nDWB (X,{\\\\alpha},\\\\b{eta}) constant in certain specific Banach spaces.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA,F.2.2\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T06:06:23Z\"}"}
