As compared to McCarthy's seminal\\nwork, we make use of a unique, Lorentz-invariant, decomposition of supermomenta\\ninto a hard and a soft piece, that we introduce and properly define, to\\ninvestigate the extent to which generic representations depart from usual\\nPoincar\\\\'e particles and highlight their relations to gravitational infrared\\nphysics. We insist on making wavefunctions as explicit as possible. Similarly,\\nwe explain how branching to a Poincar\\\\'e subgroup works in practice: this is\\nphysically relevant because this amounts to reading off the field content of a\\ngiven BMS state in terms of a choice of gravity vacuum. In particular, we\\nemphasise how different gravity vacua differ in their interpretation of the\\nsame BMS state, here again providing concrete examples as well as the general\\nprocedure. Finally, we demonstrate on an example that generic BMS particles are\\nflexible enough to encode memory, as opposed to usual Poincar\\\\'e particles.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T16:05:13Z\"}"}
