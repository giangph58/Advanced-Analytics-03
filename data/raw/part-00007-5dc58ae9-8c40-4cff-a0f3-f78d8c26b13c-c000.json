{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15248v1\", \"title\": \"Searching for Compact Obscured Nuclei in Compton Thick AGN\", \"summary\": \"Compact Obscured Nuclei (CONs) are heavily obscured infrared cores that have\\nbeen found in local (ultra)luminous infrared galaxies (U/LIRGs). They show\\nbright emission from vibrationally excited rotational transitions of HCN, known\\nas HCN-vib, and are thought to harbor Compton Thick (CT, $N_{\\\\text{H}} \\\\geq\\n10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) active galactic nuclei (AGN) or extreme compact starbursts.\\nWe explore the potential evolutionary link between CONs and CT AGN by searching\\nfor CONs in hard X-ray-confirmed CT AGN from the Great Observatories All-sky\\nLIRG Survey (GOALS). Here, we present new Atacama Large\\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array Band 6 observations that targeted HCN-vib\\nemission in four hard X-ray-confirmed CT AGN. We analyze these objects together\\nwith literature HCN-vib measurements of five additional hard X-ray-confirmed CT\\nAGN from the GOALS sample. We do not detect any CONs in this combined sample of\\nnine CT AGN. We then explore a proposed evolutionary sequence in which CONs\\nevolve into X-ray-detectable CT AGN once outflows and feedback reduce the\\ncolumn densities of the enshrouding gas. We find, however, no evidence of\\nwell-developed dense molecular outflows in the observed CT AGN. While this\\ncould suggest that CT AGN are not universally linked to CONs, it could also be\\nexplained by a short duty cycle for molecular outflows.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T17:25:43Z\"}"}
