Next, we\\nexamine the problem of constructing ground state solutions\\n$u:\\\\mathbb{R}^{d+k}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^m$ of the system $\\\\Delta u(x)=\\\\nabla W(u(x))$\\n(with $W:\\\\mathbb{R}^m\\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$), corresponding to some nontrivial stable\\nsolutions $e:\\\\mathbb{R}^k\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^m$. The method we propose is based on a\\nreduction to a ground state problem in a space of functions $\\\\mathcal H$, where\\n$e$ is viewed as a local minimum of an effective potential defined in $\\\\mathcal\\nH$. As an application, by considering a heteroclinic orbit\\n$e:\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^m$, we obtain nontrivial solutions\\n$u:\\\\mathbb{R}^{d+1}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^m$ ($d\\\\geq 2$), converging asymptotically to\\n$e$, which can be seen as the homoclinic analogs of the heteroclinic double\\nlayers, initially constructed by Alama-Bronsard-Gui and Schatzman.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:45:59Z\"}"}
