{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04246v1\", \"title\": \"Learning-Based Approaches for Job Shop Scheduling Problems: A Review\", \"summary\": \"Job Shop Scheduling (JSS) is one of the most studied combinatorial\\noptimization problems. It involves scheduling a set of jobs with predefined\\nprocessing constraints on a set of machines to achieve a desired objective,\\nsuch as minimizing makespan, tardiness, or flowtime. Since it introduction, JSS\\nhas become an attractive research area. Many approaches have been successfully\\nused to address this problem, including exact methods, heuristics, and\\nmeta-heuristics. Furthermore, various learning-based approaches have been\\nproposed to solve the JSS problem. However, these approaches are still limited\\nwhen compared to the more established methods. This paper summarizes and\\nevaluates the most important works in the literature on machine learning\\napproaches for the JSSP. We present models, analyze their benefits and\\nlimitations, and propose future research directions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC,cs.DM\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:49:42Z\"}"}
