The radar\\nsensing geometry of ISAC will be multistatic since that corresponds to the\\ncommon distributed structure of a mobile communication network. Within this\\nframework, micro-Doppler analysis plays a vital role in classifying targets\\nbased on their micromotions, such as rotating propellers, vibration, or moving\\nlimbs. However, research on bistatic micro-Doppler effects, particularly in\\nISAC systems utilizing OFDM waveforms, remains limited. Existing methods,\\nincluding electromagnetic simulations often lack scalability for generating the\\nlarge datasets required to train machine learning algorithms. To address this\\ngap, this work introduces an OFDM-based bistatic micro-Doppler model for\\nmulti-propeller drones. The proposed model adapts the classic thin-wire model\\nto include bistatic sensing configuration with an OFDM-like signal. Then, it\\nextends further by incorporating multiple propellers and integrating the\\nreflectivity of the drone's static parts. Measurements were performed to\\ncollect ground truth data for verification of the proposed model. Validation\\nresults show that the model generates micro-Doppler signatures closely\\nresembling those obtained from measurements, demonstrating its potential as a\\ntool for data generation. In addition, it offers a comprehensive approach to\\nanalyzing bistatic micro-Doppler effects.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T15:12:24Z\"}"}
