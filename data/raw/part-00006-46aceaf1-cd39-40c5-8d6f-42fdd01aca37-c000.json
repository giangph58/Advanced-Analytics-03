{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11011v1\", \"title\": \"Document Quality Scoring for Web Crawling\", \"summary\": \"The internet contains large amounts of low-quality content, yet users expect\\nweb search engines to deliver high-quality, relevant results. The abundant\\npresence of low-quality pages can negatively impact retrieval and crawling\\nprocesses by wasting resources on these documents. Therefore, search engines\\ncan greatly benefit from techniques that leverage efficient quality estimation\\nmethods to mitigate these negative impacts. Quality scoring methods for web\\npages are useful for many processes typical for web search systems, including\\nstatic index pruning, index tiering, and crawling. Building on work by Chang et\\nal.~\\\\cite{chang2024neural}, who proposed using neural estimators of semantic\\nquality for static index pruning, we extend their approach and apply their\\nneural quality scorers to assess the semantic quality of web pages in crawling\\nprioritisation tasks. In our experimental analysis, we found that prioritising\\nsemantically high-quality pages over low-quality ones can improve downstream\\nsearch effectiveness. Our software contribution consists of a Docker container\\nthat computes an effective quality score for a given web page, allowing the\\nquality scorer to be easily included and used in other components of web search\\nsystems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T09:32:57Z\"}"}
