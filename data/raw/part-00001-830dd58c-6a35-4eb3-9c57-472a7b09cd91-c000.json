{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07015v1\", \"title\": \"LLM-IFT: LLM-Powered Information Flow Tracking for Secure Hardware\", \"summary\": \"As modern hardware designs grow in complexity and size, ensuring security\\nacross the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad becomes\\nincreasingly challenging. Information flow tracking (IFT) is a widely-used\\napproach to tracing data propagation, identifying unauthorized activities that\\nmay compromise confidentiality or/and integrity in hardware. However,\\ntraditional IFT methods struggle with scalability and adaptability,\\nparticularly in high-density and interconnected architectures, leading to\\ntracing bottlenecks that limit applicability in large-scale hardware. To\\naddress these limitations and show the potential of transformer-based models in\\nintegrated circuit (IC) design, this paper introduces LLM-IFT that integrates\\nlarge language models (LLM) for the realization of the IFT process in hardware.\\nLLM-IFT exploits LLM-driven structured reasoning to perform hierarchical\\ndependency analysis, systematically breaking down even the most complex\\ndesigns. Through a multi-step LLM invocation, the framework analyzes both\\nintra-module and inter-module dependencies, enabling comprehensive IFT\\nassessment. By focusing on a set of Trust-Hub vulnerability test cases at both\\nthe IP level and the SoC level, our experiments demonstrate a 100\\\\% success\\nrate in accurate IFT analysis for confidentiality and integrity checks in\\nhardware.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T16:32:13Z\"}"}
