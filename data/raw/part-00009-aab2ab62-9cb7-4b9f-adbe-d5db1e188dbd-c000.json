This work attempts to simultaneously study the\\nmasses and strong decay widths of some singly heavy baryons, in order to\\nprovide possible quantum numbers for these states. The chiral quark model and\\nthe $^{3}P_{0}$ decay model are employed to calculate the masses and decay\\nwidths of $\\\\Lambda_{c(b)}$ and $\\\\Sigma_{c(b)}$ baryons for all quantum numbers\\nwith $2S$, $1P$, and $2P$ waves. We considered not only two-body strong decays\\nbut also the influence of three-body decays. Our calculations show that: (i)\\nFor states with experimentally determined quantum numbers, such as\\n$\\\\Lambda_c(2595)$, $\\\\Lambda_c(2625)$, $\\\\Lambda_b(5912)$ and $\\\\Lambda_b(5920)$,\\nthe results are consistent with experimental data and the conclusions of most\\ntheoretical studies. (ii) For states whose quantum numbers have not yet been\\nfully determined experimentally, we provide possible interpretations. For\\nexample, our calculations tend to interpret $\\\\Lambda_c(2910)$ is interpreted as\\na $J^P=\\\\frac{3}{2}^-$ state with 1P-wave $\\\\rho$-mode or a $J^P=\\\\frac{1}{2}^-$\\nstate with 2P wave $\\\\lambda$-mode. $\\\\Lambda_c(2940)$ can be interpreted as the\\n$J^P=\\\\frac{3}{2}^-$ state with 2P-wave $\\\\lambda$-mode. For $\\\\Lambda_c(2860)$,\\nwe offer a different interpretation, proposing that its mass and width closely\\nmatch those of a 2P-wave $J^P=\\\\frac{1}{2}^{-}$ state. It is hoped that our\\ncalculations can provide valuable information for the experimental and\\ntheoretical studies of heavy baryons.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T12:37:20Z\"}"}
