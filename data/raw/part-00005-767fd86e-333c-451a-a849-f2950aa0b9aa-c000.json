The usual assumption is that degradation units come from a homogeneous\\npopulation. But in presence of high variability in the manufacturing process,\\nthis assumption is not true in general; that is different sub-populations are\\ninvolved in the study. Predicting residual lifetime of a functioning unit is a\\nmajor challenge in the degradation modeling especially in heterogeneous\\nenvironment. To account for heterogeneous degradation data, we have proposed a\\nBayesian semi-parametric approach to relax the conventional modeling\\nassumptions. We model the degradation path using Dirichlet process mixture of\\nnormal distributions. Based on the samples obtained from posterior distribution\\nof model parameters we obtain residual lifetime distribution for individual\\nunit. Transformation based MCMC technique is used for simulating values from\\nthe derived residual lifetime distribution for prediction of residual lifetime.\\nA simulation study is undertaken to check performance of the proposed\\nsemi-parametric model compared with parametric model. Fatigue Crack Size data\\nis analyzed to illustrate the proposed methodology.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T11:14:56Z\"}"}
