{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11015v1\", \"title\": \"AnimeDL-2M: Million-Scale AI-Generated Anime Image Detection and\\n  Localization in Diffusion Era\", \"summary\": \"Recent advances in image generation, particularly diffusion models, have\\nsignificantly lowered the barrier for creating sophisticated forgeries, making\\nimage manipulation detection and localization (IMDL) increasingly challenging.\\nWhile prior work in IMDL has focused largely on natural images, the anime\\ndomain remains underexplored-despite its growing vulnerability to AI-generated\\nforgeries. Misrepresentations of AI-generated images as hand-drawn artwork,\\ncopyright violations, and inappropriate content modifications pose serious\\nthreats to the anime community and industry. To address this gap, we propose\\nAnimeDL-2M, the first large-scale benchmark for anime IMDL with comprehensive\\nannotations. It comprises over two million images including real, partially\\nmanipulated, and fully AI-generated samples. Experiments indicate that models\\ntrained on existing IMDL datasets of natural images perform poorly when applied\\nto anime images, highlighting a clear domain gap between anime and natural\\nimages. To better handle IMDL tasks in anime domain, we further propose\\nAniXplore, a novel model tailored to the visual characteristics of anime\\nimagery. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AniXplore achieves superior\\nperformance compared to existing methods.
