{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19847v1\", \"title\": \"Foundation Model-Driven Framework for Human-Object Interaction\\n  Prediction with Segmentation Mask Integration\", \"summary\": \"In this work, we introduce Segmentation to Human-Object Interaction\\n(\\\\textit{\\\\textbf{Seg2HOI}}) approach, a novel framework that integrates\\nsegmentation-based vision foundation models with the human-object interaction\\ntask, distinguished from traditional detection-based Human-Object Interaction\\n(HOI) methods. Our approach enhances HOI detection by not only predicting the\\nstandard triplets but also introducing quadruplets, which extend HOI triplets\\nby including segmentation masks for human-object pairs. More specifically,\\nSeg2HOI inherits the properties of the vision foundation model (e.g.,\\npromptable and interactive mechanisms) and incorporates a decoder that applies\\nthese attributes to HOI task. Despite training only for HOI, without additional\\ntraining mechanisms for these properties, the framework demonstrates that such\\nfeatures still operate efficiently. Extensive experiments on two public\\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that Seg2HOI achieves performance comparable to\\nstate-of-the-art methods, even in zero-shot scenarios. Lastly, we propose that\\nSeg2HOI can generate HOI quadruplets and interactive HOI segmentation from\\nnovel text and visual prompts that were not used during training, making it\\nversatile for a wide range of applications by leveraging this flexibility.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:45:26Z\"}"}
