{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17510v1\", \"title\": \"Safe to Stay: Psychological Safety Sustains Participation in Pull-based\\n  Open Source Projects\", \"summary\": \"Psychological safety is the belief that team members can speak up or make\\nmistakes without fear of negative consequences. While it is recognized as\\nimportant in traditional software teams, its role in open-source development\\nremains understudied. Yet, open-source contributors often collaborate without\\nformal roles or structures, where interpersonal relationship can make or break\\nparticipation. In this study, we examine whether team-level psychological\\nsafety, inferred from code review activities, is associated with contributors'\\ncontinued participation in open-source projects. Code review is a central and\\ncollaborative activity in modern software development, which offers a rich\\ncontext for observing team interactions. Based on 60,684 pull requests, we\\nconstruct a psychological safety index using cues such as merge decisions,\\ncomment activity, interaction diversity, and mentions. We analyze its\\nrelationship with contributors' short-term (after 1 year) and long-term (after\\n4-5 years) sustained participation using three logistic regression models. Our\\nfindings show that contributors are more likely to remain active in\\nrepositories with higher levels of psychological safety. Psychological safety\\nis positively associated with both short-term and future sustained\\nparticipation. However, when prior participation is included, it becomes the\\nstronger predictor of future sustained participation, while the effect of\\npsychological safety becomes smaller. This study introduces a scalable approach\\nto study psychological safety through pull request data and provides new\\nevidence that it matters in open-source development.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T12:54:30Z\"}"}
