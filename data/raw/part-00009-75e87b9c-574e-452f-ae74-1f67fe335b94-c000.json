{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05306v1\", \"title\": \"The calculus of neo-Peircean relations\", \"summary\": \"The calculus of relations was introduced by De Morgan and Peirce during the\\nsecond half of the 19th century. Later developments on quantification theory by\\nFrege and Peirce himself, paved the way to what is known today as first-order\\nlogic, causing the calculus of relations to be long forgotten. This was until\\n1941, when Tarski raised the question on the existence of a complete\\naxiomatisation for it. This question found only negative answers: there is no\\nfinite axiomatisation for the calculus of relations and many of its fragments,\\nas shown later by several no-go theorems. In this paper we show that -- by\\nmoving from traditional syntax (cartesian) to a diagrammatic one (monoidal) --\\nit is possible to have complete axiomatisations for the full calculus. The\\nno-go theorems are circumvented by the fact that our calculus, named the\\ncalculus of neo-Peircean relations, is more expressive than the calculus of\\nrelations and, actually, as expressive as first-order logic. The axioms are\\nobtained by combining two well known categorical structures: cartesian and\\nlinear bicategories.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LO\", \"categories\": \"cs.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:52:25Z\"}"}
