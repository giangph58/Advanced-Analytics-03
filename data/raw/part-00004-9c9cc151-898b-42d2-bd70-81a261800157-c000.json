GuideSR addresses this limitation by introducing a\\ndual-branch architecture comprising: (1) a Guidance Branch that preserves\\nhigh-fidelity structures from the original-resolution degraded input, and (2) a\\nDiffusion Branch, which a pre-trained latent diffusion model to enhance\\nperceptual quality. Unlike conventional conditioning mechanisms, our Guidance\\nBranch features a tailored structure for image restoration tasks, combining\\nFull Resolution Blocks (FRBs) with channel attention and an Image Guidance\\nNetwork (IGN) with guided attention. By embedding detailed structural\\ninformation directly into the restoration pipeline, GuideSR produces sharper\\nand more visually consistent results. Extensive experiments on benchmark\\ndatasets demonstrate that GuideSR achieves state-of-the-art performance while\\nmaintaining the low computational cost of single-step approaches, with up to\\n1.39dB PSNR gain on challenging real-world datasets. Our approach consistently\\noutperforms existing methods across various reference-based metrics including\\nPSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, DISTS and FID, further representing a practical advancement\\nfor real-world image restoration.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T17:48:25Z\"}"}
