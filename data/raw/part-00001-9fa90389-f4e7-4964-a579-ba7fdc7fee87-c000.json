In this work,\\nwe integrate lateral connections with a substructure selection network to\\ndevelop a novel diffusion model based on spiking neural networks (SNNs). Unlike\\nconventional artificial neural networks, SNNs employ an intrinsic spiking inner\\nloop to process sequential binary spikes. We leverage this spiking inner loop\\nalongside a lateral connection mechanism to iteratively refine the substructure\\nselection network, enhancing model adaptability and expressivity. Specifically,\\nwe design a lateral connection framework comprising a learnable lateral matrix\\nand a lateral mapping function, both implemented using spiking neurons, to\\ndynamically update lateral connections. Through mathematical modeling, we\\nestablish that the proposed lateral update mechanism, under a well-defined\\nlocal objective, aligns with biologically plausible synaptic plasticity\\nprinciples. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach,\\nanalyzing the role of substructure selection and lateral connection during\\ntraining. Furthermore, quantitative comparisons demonstrate that our model\\nconsistently surpasses state-of-the-art SNN-based generative models across\\nmultiple benchmark datasets.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NE\", \"categories\": \"cs.NE\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T06:31:50Z\"}"}
