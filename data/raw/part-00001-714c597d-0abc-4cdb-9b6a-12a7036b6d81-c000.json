We pioneer the application of this\\ntechnique to new wavelength regimes, and search for dropouts in combined ALMA\\nand JWST data. We find a candidate that is undetected in NIRCam imaging\\nincluding and blueward of the F444W filter, but clearly identified in ALMA band\\n3. Assuming this is a Lyman-break candidate, we measure a redshift in the range\\n$40 < z < 21\\\\,380$. This is the highest redshift galaxy candidate discovered to\\ndate, and is in significant tension with current and future predictions from\\ncosmological simulations, with implications for galaxy evolution in the (very)\\nearly Universe.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:59:15Z\"}"}
