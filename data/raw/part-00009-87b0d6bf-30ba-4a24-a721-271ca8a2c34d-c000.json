{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11914v1\", \"title\": \"AnomalyR1: A GRPO-based End-to-end MLLM for Industrial Anomaly Detection\", \"summary\": \"Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) poses a formidable challenge due to the\\nscarcity of defective samples, making it imperative to deploy models capable of\\nrobust generalization to detect unseen anomalies effectively. Traditional\\napproaches, often constrained by hand-crafted features or domain-specific\\nexpert models, struggle to address this limitation, underscoring the need for a\\nparadigm shift. We introduce AnomalyR1, a pioneering framework that leverages\\nVLM-R1, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) renowned for its exceptional\\ngeneralization and interpretability, to revolutionize IAD. By integrating MLLM\\nwith Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), enhanced by our novel Reasoned\\nOutcome Alignment Metric (ROAM), AnomalyR1 achieves a fully end-to-end solution\\nthat autonomously processes inputs of image and domain knowledge, reasons\\nthrough analysis, and generates precise anomaly localizations and masks. Based\\non the latest multimodal IAD benchmark, our compact 3-billion-parameter model\\noutperforms existing methods, establishing state-of-the-art results. As MLLM\\ncapabilities continue to advance, this study is the first to deliver an\\nend-to-end VLM-based IAD solution that demonstrates the transformative\\npotential of ROAM-enhanced GRPO, positioning our framework as a forward-looking\\ncornerstone for next-generation intelligent anomaly detection systems in\\nindustrial applications with limited defective data.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T09:48:41Z\"}"}
