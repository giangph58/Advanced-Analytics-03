{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05184v1\", \"title\": \"In-Situ Model Validation for Continuous Processes Using In-Network\\n  Computing\", \"summary\": \"The advancing industrial digitalization enables evolved process control\\nschemes that rely on accurate models learned through data-driven approaches.\\nWhile they provide high control performance and are robust to smaller\\ndeviations, a larger change in process behavior can pose significant\\nchallenges, in the worst case even leading to a damaged process plant. Hence,\\nit is important to frequently assess the fit between the model and the actual\\nprocess behavior. As the number of controlled processes and associated data\\nvolumes increase, the need for lightweight and fast reacting assessment\\nsolutions also increases. In this paper, we propose CIVIC, an in-network\\ncomputing-based solution for Continuous In-situ Validation of Industrial\\nControl models. In short, CIVIC monitors relevant process variables and detects\\ndifferent process states through comparison with a priori knowledge about the\\ndesired process behavior. This detection can then be leveraged to, e.g., shut\\ndown the process or trigger a reconfiguration. We prototype CIVIC on an Intel\\nTofino-based switch and apply it to a lab-scale water treatment plant. Our\\nresults show that we can achieve a high detection accuracy, proving that such\\nmonitoring systems are feasible and sensible.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T12:33:51Z\"}"}
