One of the\\nfundamental tools to efficiently simulate quantum dynamics is the Trotter\\ndecomposition of the time-evolution operator, and various quantum-classical\\nhybrid algorithms have been proposed to implement Trotterization. Given that\\nsome quantum hardware is publicly accessible, it is important to assess the\\npractical performance of Trotterization on them. However, a straightforward\\nTrotter decomposition of the Hamiltonian often leads to quantum circuits with\\nlarge depth, which hinders accurate simulation on devices with limited\\ncoherence time. In this work, we propose a hardware-efficient Trotterization\\nscheme for the time evolution of a 3-site, $J=1$ XXX Heisenberg model. By\\nexploiting the symmetry of the Hamiltonian, we derive an effective Hamiltonian\\nthat acts on a reduced subspace, significantly lowering the circuit depth after\\noptimization for specific evolution times. This approach can be interpreted as\\na change of basis in the standard Trotterization scheme. We also test our\\nmethod on the IBM Quantum device ibmq_jakarta. Combining with the readout error\\nmitigation and the zero-noise extrapolation, we obtain the fidelity $0.9928 \\\\pm\\n0.0013$ for the simulation of the time evolution of the Heisenberg model from\\nthe time $t=0$ to $t=\\\\pi$.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T16:31:39Z\"}"}
