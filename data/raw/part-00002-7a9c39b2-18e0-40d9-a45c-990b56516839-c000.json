{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20884v1\", \"title\": \"Gravitational Form Factors and the QCD Dilaton at Large Momentum\\n  Transfer\", \"summary\": \"We investigate the hard scatterings of hadronic matrix elements corresponding\\nto hadronic gravitational form factors (GFFs) of the pion and proton using QCD\\nfactorization, applying conformal field theory (CFT) tools. These GFFs are key\\nto understanding quark and gluon angular momentum via their connection to DVCS\\nmoments. The core object is the non-Abelian \\\\( TJJ \\\\) 3-point function, which\\nshows an anomaly-induced dilaton exchange in the \\\\( t \\\\)-channel. We analyze\\nquark, ghost, and gauge-fixing effects through a CFT-based decomposition and\\npropose a parameterization useful for future DVCS studies at the Electron-Ion\\nCollider. The dilaton interaction is interpolated by a conformal anomaly form\\nfactor, defined in the nonconformal case, which is constrained by a (dilaton)\\nsum rule.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T15:58:32Z\"}"}
