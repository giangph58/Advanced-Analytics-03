Safety is\\ncritical in performing satellite maintenance, so the control techniques\\nutilized must be trusted in addition to being highly efficient. In this work,\\nGenetic Fuzzy Trees are combined with the widely used LQR control scheme via\\nThales' TrUE AI Toolkit to create a trusted and efficient controller for a\\ntwo-degree-of-freedom planar robotic manipulator that would theoretically be\\nused to perform satellite maintenance. It was found that Genetic Fuzzy-LQR is\\n18.5% more performant than optimal LQR on average, and that it is incredibly\\nrobust to uncertainty.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T16:57:56Z\"}"}
