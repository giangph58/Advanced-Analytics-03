In addition to strong\\nquantum noise reduction, key desiderata for such a nanophotonic squeezer\\ninclude frequency agility or tunability over a broad frequency range, and\\nsimultaneous operation in many distinct, well-defined quantum modes (qumodes).\\nHere we present a strongly overcoupled silicon nitride squeezer based on a\\nbelow-threshold optical parametric amplifier (OPA) that produces directly\\ndetected squeezing of 5.6 dB $\\\\pm$ 0.2 dB, surpassing previous demonstrations\\nin both continuous-wave and pulsed regimes. We introduce a seed-assisted\\ndetection technique into such nanophotonic squeezers that reveals a quantum\\nfrequency comb (QFC) of 16 qumodes, with a separation of 11~THz between the\\nfurthest qumode pair, while maintaining a strong squeezing. Additionally, we\\nreport spectral tuning of a qumode comb pair over one free-spectral range of\\nthe OPA, thus bridging the spacing between the discrete modes of the QFC. Our\\nresults significantly advance both the generation and detection of nanophotonic\\nsqueezed light in a broadband and multimode platform, establishing a scalable,\\nchip-integrated path for compact quantum sensors and continuous-variable\\nquantum information processing systems.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T17:59:23Z\"}"}
