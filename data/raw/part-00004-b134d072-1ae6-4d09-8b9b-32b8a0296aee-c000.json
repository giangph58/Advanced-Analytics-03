We build upon\\nthis result to investigate the universal symmetry-breaking properties of such\\neigenstates. As a probe of symmetry breaking, we employ the entanglement\\nasymmetry, a quantum information observable that quantifies the extent to which\\nsymmetry is broken in a subsystem. This measure enables us to explore the finer\\nstructure of finite-temperature eigenstates in terms of the $U(1)$-symmetric\\nrandom state ensemble; in particular, the relation between the Hamiltonian and\\nthe effective conserved charge in the ensemble. Our analysis is supported by\\nanalytical calculations for the symmetric random states, as well as exact\\nnumerical results for the Mixed-Field Ising spin-$1/2$ chain, a paradigmatic\\nmodel of quantum chaoticity.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T15:41:54Z\"}"}
