A single-pointing survey\\ntoward the 559 Planck cold clumps of the Early Cold Core Catalogue (ECC) has\\nbeen conducted using the Arizona Radio Observatory 12-meter telescope, focusing\\non the $J$=1-0 transitions of DCO$^+$ and DCN. The survey included observations\\nof 309 cores for DCO$^+$ and DCN 1-0 simultaneously, followed by 71 of these\\ncores where DCO$^+$ 1-0 was detected for H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and H$^{13}$CN 1-0\\nsimultaneously, aiming to determine the deuterated fraction ($D_{\\\\rm frac}$).\\nAdditionally, 250 cores were observed for DCO$^+$, DCN, H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and\\nH$^{13}$CN 1-0 simultaneously. Among the 309 sources, DCO$^+$ and DCN 1-0 were\\ndetected in 79 and 11 sources, with a detection rates of 25.6 % and 3.6 %\\nrespectively. In the 250 sources observed for all four species, DCO$^+$, DCN,\\nH$^{13}$CO$^+$ and H$^{13}$CN 1-0 were detected in 58, 9, 57 and 13 sources,\\nwith a detection rate of 23.2 %, 3.6 %, 22.8 % and 5.2 % respectively. The\\n$D_{\\\\rm frac}$(HCO$^+$) values in 112 sources range from 0.89 % to 7.4 % with a\\nmedian value of 3.1 %, while $D_{\\\\rm frac}$(HCN) values in 11 sources range\\nfrom 1.5 % to 5.5 % with a median value of 2.3 %. The line widths of DCO$^+$\\nand H$^{13}$CO$^+$ 1-0 detections are mostly within 1 km s$^{-1}$. The\\nsimilarity in $D_{\\\\rm frac}$ values between HCO$^+$ and HCN indicates that the\\nhigher detection rate of DCO$^+$ 1-0 compared with DCN 1-0 is due to the lower\\ncritical density of DCO$^+$ 1-0. We suggest that the enhancement of DCO$^+$ and\\nDCN likely begins in the early diffuse stage of the molecular cloud, rather\\nthan during the cold core formation stage.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T13:12:40Z\"}"}
