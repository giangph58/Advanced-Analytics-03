This\\npaper presents a novel electromagnetic (EM)-based framework to accurately model\\nthe near-field (NF) scattering response of extended targets, which is then\\napplied to three canonical shapes : a flat rectangular plate, a sphere and a\\ncylinder. Mathematical expressions for the received signal are provided in each\\ncase. Based on this model, the influence of bandwidth, carrier frequency and\\ntarget distance on localisation accuracy is analysed, showing how higher\\nbandwidths and carrier frequencies improve resolution. Additionally, the impact\\nof target curvature on localisation performance is studied. Results indicate\\nthat detection performance is slightly enhanced when considering curved\\nobjects. A comparative analysis between the extended and point target models\\nshows significant similarities when targets are small and curved. However, as\\nthe target size increases or becomes flatter, the point target model introduces\\nestimation errors owing to model mismatch. The impact of this model mismatch as\\na function of system parameters is analysed, and the operational zones where\\nthe point abstraction remains valid and where it breaks down are identified.\\nThese findings provide theoretical support for experimental results based on\\npoint-target models in previous studies.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T07:40:27Z\"}"}
