These include the Deligne--Mumford, Schubert,\\nand Smyth compactifications, and many more. They can all be excised from the\\nstack of log-canonically polarised Gorenstein curves. The Chow ring of the\\nlatter admits a simple, combinatorial description, which we compute by patching\\nalong a natural stratification by core level. We further deduce that all these\\nmodular compactifications satisfy the Chow-K\\\\\\\"{u}nneth generation property,\\nthat the cycle class map is an isomorphism, and for $n=4$ we study whether the\\nGetzler's relation hold integrally.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T17:29:51Z\"}"}
