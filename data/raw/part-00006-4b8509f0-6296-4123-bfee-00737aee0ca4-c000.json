{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19658v1\", \"title\": \"Auxiliary Artifacts in Requirements Traceability: A Systematic Mapping\\n  Study\", \"summary\": \"Background: Traceability between software artifacts enhances the value of the\\ninformation those artifacts contain, but only when the links themselves are\\nreliable. Link quality is known to depend on explicit factors such as the\\ntraced artifacts and the expertise of the practitioner who judges each\\nconnection. Other factors, however, remain largely unexplored. We contend that\\none of these factors is the set of auxiliary artifacts -- artifacts that are\\nproduced and/or used during the tracing process yet are neither the source nor\\ntarget artifacts. Because such auxiliary artifacts can subtly steer how links\\nare created and validated, they merit a literature survey to identify these\\nartifacts and further investigate them. Objective: We identify and map\\nauxiliary artifacts used in requirements tracing, which could be additional\\nfactors that affect the quality of the trace links. Method: We conducted a\\nsystematic mapping study on auxiliary artifacts in requirements traceability.\\nResults: We found 110 studies in which auxiliary artifacts are used in\\nrequirements tracing, and identified 49 auxiliary artifacts, and 13 usage\\nscenarios. Conclusion: This study provides a systematic mapping of auxiliary\\nartifacts in requirement tracing, including their usage, origin, type and tool\\nsupport. The use of auxiliary artifacts in requirements tracing seems to be the\\nnorm, thus, these artifacts should be studied in depth to identify how they\\neffect the quality of traced links.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T10:18:34Z\"}"}
