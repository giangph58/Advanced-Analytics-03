We introduce a new concept of\\ndissipative weak solution of the problem based on a combination of the approach\\nproposed by Judakov with a suitable form of energy inequality. We show that\\nglobal--in--time dissipative solutions always exist as long as the rigid bodies\\nare connected compact sets. In addition, in the absence of external driving\\nforces, the system always tends to a static equilibrium as time goes to\\ninfinity. The results hold independently of possible collisions of rigid bodies\\nand for any finite energy initial data.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T12:45:43Z\"}"}
