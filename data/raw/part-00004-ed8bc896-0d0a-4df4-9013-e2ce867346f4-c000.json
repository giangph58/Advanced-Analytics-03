However, the effectiveness and\\nefficiency of MCP servers have not been well studied. To study these questions,\\nwe propose an evaluation framework, called MCPBench. We selected several widely\\nused MCP server and conducted an experimental evaluation on their accuracy,\\ntime, and token usage. Our experiments showed that the most effective MCP, Bing\\nWeb Search, achieved an accuracy of 64%. Importantly, we found that the\\naccuracy of MCP servers can be substantially enhanced by involving declarative\\ninterface. This research paves the way for further investigations into\\noptimized MCP implementations, ultimately leading to better AI-driven\\napplications and data retrieval solutions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR,cs.DB\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T11:40:12Z\"}"}
