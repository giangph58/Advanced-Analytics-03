However, data scarcity often challenges\\ntheir validation, particularly the lack of hourly measured data and the variety\\nof building samples. This study addresses this issue by applying bias\\nadjustment techniques from survey research to improve UBEM validation\\nrobustness with incomplete measured data. Error estimation tests are conducted\\nusing various levels of missingness, and three bias adjustment methods are\\nemployed: multivariate imputation, cell weighting and raking weighting. Key\\nfindings indicate that using incomplete data in UBEM validation without\\nadjustment is not advisable, while bias adjustment techniques significantly\\nenhance the robustness of validation, providing more reliable model validity\\nestimates. Cell weighting is preferable in this study due to its reliance on\\njoint distributions of auxiliary variables.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T08:23:04Z\"}"}
