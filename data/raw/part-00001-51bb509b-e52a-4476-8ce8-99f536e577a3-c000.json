Additionally, applying a dc-voltage offset (determined\\nthrough Kelvin probe force microscopy) during PFM scans and positioning the\\nprobe over the interior or edge portion of the specimen are explored to\\nminimize the local and non-local electrostatic tip-sample interaction. The\\nresults shows that the effective piezoelectric coefficient (d33-eff) of our\\nc-axis oriented wurtzite (wz)-Al1.0Sc0.0N thin film is 4.9 pm per Volt. The\\nhighest enhancement in the d33-eff value occurred in the wz-Al0.58Sc0.42N thin\\nfilm. Above x = 0.42, the d33-eff reduces due to phase-mixing of the\\nwz-Al1-xScxN phase with cubic-Sc3AlN phase till the piezoelectricity finally\\ndisappear at x = 0.51\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T05:15:54Z\"}"}
