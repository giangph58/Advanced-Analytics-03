We prove a finite, quantitative version of this\\nresult: for fixed $t$, if a graph $G$ is $K_t$-minor-free and contains every\\n$n$-vertex planar graph as a subgraph, then $G$ has $2^{\\\\Omega(\\\\sqrt{n})}$\\nvertices. If $G$ contains every $n$-vertex toroidal graph instead, then $G$ has\\n$2^{\\\\Omega(n)}$ vertices. On the other hand, we construct a polynomial size\\n$K_4$-minor-free graph containing every $n$-vertex tree as an induced subgraph,\\nand a polynomial size $K_7$-minor-free graph containing every $n$-vertex\\n$K_4$-minor-free graph as induced subgraph. This answers several problems\\nraised recently by Bergold, Ir\\\\v{s}i\\\\v{c}, Lauff, Orthaber, Scheucher and\\nWesolek.\\n  We study more generally the order of universal graphs for various classes (of\\ngraphs of bounded degree, treedepth, pathwidth, or treewidth), if the universal\\ngraphs retain some of the structure of the original class.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T08:42:34Z\"}"}
