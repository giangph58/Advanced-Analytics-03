{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09980v1\", \"title\": \"Turn-taking annotation for quantitative and qualitative analyses of\\n  conversation\", \"summary\": \"This paper has two goals. First, we present the turn-taking annotation layers\\ncreated for 95 minutes of conversational speech of the Graz Corpus of Read and\\nSpontaneous Speech (GRASS), available to the scientific community. Second, we\\ndescribe the annotation system and the annotation process in more detail, so\\nother researchers may use it for their own conversational data. The annotation\\nsystem was developed with an interdisciplinary application in mind. It should\\nbe based on sequential criteria according to Conversation Analysis, suitable\\nfor subsequent phonetic analysis, thus time-aligned annotations were made\\nPraat, and it should be suitable for automatic classification, which required\\nthe continuous annotation of speech and a label inventory that is not too large\\nand results in a high inter-rater agreement. Turn-taking was annotated on two\\nlayers, Inter-Pausal Units (IPU) and points of potential completion (PCOMP;\\nsimilar to transition relevance places). We provide a detailed description of\\nthe annotation process and of segmentation and labelling criteria. A detailed\\nanalysis of inter-rater agreement and common confusions shows that agreement\\nfor IPU annotation is near-perfect, that agreement for PCOMP annotations is\\nsubstantial, and that disagreements often are either partial or can be\\nexplained by a different analysis of a sequence which also has merit. The\\nannotation system can be applied to a variety of conversational data for\\nlinguistic studies and technological applications, and we hope that the\\nannotations, as well as the annotation system will contribute to a stronger\\ncross-fertilization between these disciplines.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.DB,cs.HC,eess.AS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T08:45:04Z\"}"}
