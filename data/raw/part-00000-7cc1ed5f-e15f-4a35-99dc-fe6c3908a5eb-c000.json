We show that outlier dimensions arise\\nin many different modern language models, and trace their function back to the\\nheuristic of constantly predicting frequent words. We further show how a model\\ncan block this heuristic when it is not contextually appropriate, by assigning\\na counterbalancing weight mass to the remaining dimensions, and we investigate\\nwhich model parameters boost outlier dimensions and when they arise during\\ntraining. We conclude that outlier dimensions are a specialized mechanism\\ndiscovered by many distinct models to implement a useful token prediction\\nheuristic.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI,I.2.7\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:30:50Z\"}"}
