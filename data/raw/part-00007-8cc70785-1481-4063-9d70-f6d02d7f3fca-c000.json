We prove that if $K$ is the connected sum $K' \\\\# 3_1$ of an\\narbitrary knot $K'$ and the trefoil knot $3_1$ (or its mirror), then there is\\nno compactly supported Hamiltonian diffeomorphism $\\\\varphi$ on\\n$T^*\\\\mathbb{R}^3$ such that $\\\\varphi(L_K)$ and the zero section $\\\\mathbb{R}^3$\\nintersect cleanly along the unknot in $\\\\mathbb{R}^3$. For the proof, we utilize\\nthe knot DGA, whose homology was proved to be isomorphic to the knot contact\\nhomology by Ekholm, Etnyre, Ng and Sullivan, with coefficients in\\n$\\\\mathbb{Z}[\\\\lambda^{\\\\pm},\\\\mu^{\\\\pm},U^{\\\\pm}]$. We discover a certain algebraic\\nconstraint imposed on any augmentation of the knot DGA of $K = K'\\\\# 3_1$ to a\\nfield $\\\\mathbf{k}$. This constraint is non-trivial for $\\\\mathbf{k}=\\\\mathbb{Q}$\\nand plays a key role in the proof, but trivial if $\\\\mathbf{k}$ is quadratically\\nclosed or if an augmentation factors through the knot DGA with coefficients in\\n$\\\\mathbb{Z}[\\\\lambda^{\\\\pm},\\\\mu^{\\\\pm}]$ obtained by setting $U=1$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.SG\", \"categories\": \"math.SG,math.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T05:58:44Z\"}"}
