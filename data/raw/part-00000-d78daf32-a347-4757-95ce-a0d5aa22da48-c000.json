In this paper, we introduce a projected gradient descent method to\\nestimate the tropical principal polytope over the space of phylogenetic trees\\nand we apply it to apicomplexa dataset. With computational experiment against\\nMCMC samplers, we show that our projected gradient descent works very well.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,q-bio.PE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:00:32Z\"}"}
