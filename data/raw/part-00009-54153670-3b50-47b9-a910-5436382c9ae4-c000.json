The purpose of this work is to derive relations\\nbetween observables characterizing the low-energy negative parity states in\\neven-even nuclei and to investigate the dependence of E2 transitions between\\nthe low-energy collective states in these nuclei on the parity of states. The\\nHamiltonian of the Collective Model and the fermionic Q-phonon representation\\nof the vectors of collective states are used. Relations between different E1\\ntransition matrix elements are derived and the parity dependence of E2\\ntransitions is investigated. Relations between the observables characterizing\\nthe low-lying collective states of both parities in even-even nuclei are\\nobtained, which can be verified using experimental data produced by facilities\\ngenerating intense monochromatic beams of $\\\\gamma$-quanta.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T10:14:12Z\"}"}
