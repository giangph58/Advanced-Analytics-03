{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10108v1\", \"title\": \"A Photometric Comparison of B and Be stars using Gaia DR3\", \"summary\": \"Previous studies have observed significant photometric differences between\\nnon-emission B-type and classical Be stars, however the precise mechanism\\nresponsible for these differences is unclear. This study combines the Bright\\nStar Catalogue with Tycho and Gaia photometry to create a homogeneous sample of\\n1015 of the closest and brightest B and Be-type field stars with 90 per cent of\\nobjects at distances < 500pc. Due to their proximity, the extinction towards\\nthese objects is very low, ensuring we minimise any obfuscation in the\\nreddening correction and final photometry. We present our findings in both\\nTycho and Gaia photometry through colour magnitude diagrams and present\\nintrinsic colours and absolute magnitudes for each spectral type. We find Be\\nstars are on average ~0.5 magnitudes brighter in both Gaia $G$ and Tycho V$_T$\\ncompared to non-emission B stars of the same spectral type. Additionally, we\\nfind tentative evidence that Be stars are redder in Gaia B$_P$$-$R$_P$,\\nparticularly for the earlier types, but have similar Tycho B$_T$$-$V$_T$\\ncolours. We test the effects of gravitational darkening due to rapid rotation\\nand binarity on the photometry of our sample and find both to be insufficient\\nto explain the observed photometric differences between B and Be stars. We\\nconclude that the most likely mechanism responsible for the observed\\nphotometric differences is the combined effect of the circumstellar disc and\\nstellar evolution up the Main Sequence, with the disc dominating early-types\\nand evolution dominating late type stars.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T11:15:45Z\"}"}
