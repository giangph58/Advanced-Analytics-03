Frequency\\ndifferences between overtone modes -- large separations -- probe stellar\\ndensity, while differences between low-degree modes -- small separations --\\nprobe the sound speed gradient in the energy-generating core of main sequence\\nSun-like stars, and hence their ages. At later phases of stellar evolution,\\ncharacterised by inert cores, small separations are believed to lose much of\\ntheir power to probe deep interiors and simply become proportional to large\\nseparations. Here, we present clear evidence of a rapidly evolving convective\\nzone as stars evolve from the subgiant phase into red giants. By measuring\\nacoustic oscillations in 27 stars from the open cluster M67, we observe\\ndeviations of proportionality between small and large separations, which are\\ncaused by the influence of the bottom of the convective envelope. These\\ndeviations become apparent as the convective envelope penetrates deep into the\\nstar during subgiant and red giant evolution, eventually entering an ultra-deep\\nregime that leads to the red giant branch luminosity bump. The tight sequence\\nof cluster stars, free of large spreads in ages and fundamental properties, is\\nessential for revealing the connection between the observed small separations\\nand the chemical discontinuities occurring at the bottom of the convective\\nenvelope. We use this sequence to show that combining large and small\\nseparations can improve estimations of the masses and ages of field stars well\\nafter the main sequence.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:37:26Z\"}"}
