{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19870v1\", \"title\": \"exoALMA II: Data Calibration and Imaging Pipeline\", \"summary\": \"The exoALMA Large Program was designed to search for subtle kinematic\\ndeviations from Keplerian motion, indicative of embedded planets, in high\\nangular and spectral resolution Band 7 observations of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO and\\nCS emission from protoplanetary disks. This paper summarizes the calibration\\nand imaging pipelines used by the exoALMA collaboration. With sources ranging\\nin diameter from 2.4\\\" to 13.8\\\" when probed by $^{12}$CO, multiple antennae\\nconfigurations were required to maximally recover all spatial information\\n(including the ACA for 7 sources). Combining these datasets warranted\\nparticular care in their alignment during calibration and prior to imaging, so\\nas not to introduce spurious features that might resemble the kinematic\\ndeviations being investigated. Phase decoherence was found in several datasets,\\nwhich was corrected by an iterative self-calibration procedure, and we explored\\nthe effects of the order of operations of spatial alignment, flux scaling, and\\nself-calibration. A number of different imaging sets were produced for the\\ncontinuum and line emission, employing an iterative masking procedure that\\nminimizes bias due to non-Keplerian motions in the disk.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:01:57Z\"}"}
