{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05236v1\", \"title\": \"Thermoelastic Kirchhoff Plate: A Novel Model for Shot Peen Forming Metal\\n  Panels\", \"summary\": \"A common technique used in factories to shape metal panels is shot peen\\nforming, where the panel is sprayed with a high-velocity stream of small steel\\npellets called shot. The impacts between the hard steel shot and softer\\naluminum panel cause localized plastic deformation, both improving the fatigue\\nproperties of the material's surface and imparting a residual stress\\ndistribution that results in bending. Thus, a torque is associated with the\\nthrough-thickness shot peen stress distribution. We conceptualize shot peen\\nforming as the application of spatially varying torques, which are modeled with\\nthe input of applied temperatures. In this paper, we derive the bending\\nequations for a thermally loaded homogeneous Kirchhoff plate in order to\\npredict the effects of shot peen forming. A simple test is devised to extract\\nthe value of an equivalent applied torque from the bending response of\\nuniformly shot peened plates, which circumvents the difficulty of accounting\\nfor surface plasticity. This torque can be used as an input to a model which\\npredicts the shape of rectangular plates under more complicated shot peen\\nconditions. An experiment is designed and carried out which investigates the\\nagreement between the model and real shot peen operations. The effect of\\nuncertainty in the experiment is estimated with Monte Carlo methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CE\", \"categories\": \"cs.CE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:30:43Z\"}"}
