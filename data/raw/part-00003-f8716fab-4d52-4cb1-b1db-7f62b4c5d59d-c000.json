This framework\\ncouples pre-equilibrium dynamics with hydrodynamic evolution by solving the\\nBoltzmann equation within the isotropization time approximation. A numerical\\nscheme based on the method of characteristics enables the evolution to begin\\nfrom a specified initial Boltzmann distribution. In this work, the spatial\\nstructure of the initial distribution is modeled using the TrENTo framework.\\nOur results show that a medium initialized at $\\\\tau_0 $ in the order of\\n1\\\\,[fm/$c$] with a small shear viscosity to entropy density ratio ($\\\\eta/s =\\n0.008$) evolves consistently with hydrodynamic simulations, such as those\\nperformed using the VISH2+1 code, while discrepancies arise for a medium with\\n$\\\\eta/s = 0.8$. Furthermore, when initialized with a highly anisotropic\\nmomentum distribution in the longitudinal direction at early times, the system\\nexhibits spatially non-uniform thermalization in the transverse plane, leading\\nto the emergence of a nontrivial hypersurface that marks the onset of\\nhydrodynamic applicability.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-th,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T16:12:45Z\"}"}
