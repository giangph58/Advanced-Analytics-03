{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19575v1\", \"title\": \"Positive Almost-Sure Termination of Polynomial Random Walks\", \"summary\": \"The number of steps until termination of a probabilistic program is a random\\nvariable. Probabilistic program termination therefore requires qualitative\\nanalysis via almost-sure termination (AST), while also providing quantitative\\nanswers via positive almost-sure termination (PAST) on the expected number of\\nsteps until termination. While every program which is PAST is AST, the converse\\nis not true. The symmetric random walk with constant step size is a prominent\\nexample of a program that is AST but not PAST.\\n  In this paper we show that a more general class of polynomial random walks is\\nPAST. Our random walks implement a step size that is polynomially increasing in\\nthe number of loop iterations and have a constant probability $p$ of choosing\\neither branch. We decide that such programs are PAST when the degree of the\\npolynomial is higher than both the degree of the drift and a threshold\\n$d_\\\\text{min}(p)$. Our approach does not use proof rules, nor auxiliary\\narithmetic expressions, such as martingales or invariants. Rather, we establish\\nan inductive bound for the cumulative distribution function of the loop guard,\\nbased on which PAST is proven.\\n  We implemented the approximation of this threshold, by combining genetic\\nprogramming, algebraic reasoning and linear programming.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LO\", \"categories\": \"cs.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T08:33:26Z\"}"}
