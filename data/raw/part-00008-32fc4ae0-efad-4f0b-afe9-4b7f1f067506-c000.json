Building on differential geometric methods, we reformulate\\nFilippov's notion of solutions, characterize well-defined vector fields on\\nquotient spaces, and provide a consistent geometric definition of higher-order\\nsliding modes. We generalize the regular form to non-Euclidean settings and\\ndesign explicit first- and second-order sliding-mode controllers that respect\\nthe manifold structure. Particular attention is given to the role of\\ntopological obstructions, which are illustrated through examples on the\\ncylinder, M\\\\\\\"obius bundle, and 2-sphere. Our results highlight how geometric\\nand topological properties fundamentally influence sliding dynamics and suggest\\nnew directions for robust control in nonlinear spaces.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.SY,eess.SY,math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T05:57:29Z\"}"}
