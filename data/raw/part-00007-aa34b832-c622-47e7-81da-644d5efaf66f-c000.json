However, their ability to precisely\\ncontrol squeezing properties may be insufficient for the next generation of\\ndetectors. In this context, theoretical studies on linear three-mirror cavities\\nhave revealed promising features, such as resonance peak splitting and their\\nequivalence to two-mirror cavities with variable finesse. In this paper, we\\nreport experimental observations of both the resonant doublet and variable\\nfinesse using a meter-scale implementation of a linear three-mirror cavity.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T10:46:49Z\"}"}
