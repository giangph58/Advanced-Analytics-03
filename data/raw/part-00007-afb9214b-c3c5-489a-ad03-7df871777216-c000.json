{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05354v1\", \"title\": \"High-fidelity Grain Growth Modeling: Leveraging Deep Learning for Fast\\n  Computations\", \"summary\": \"Grain growth simulation is crucial for predicting metallic material\\nmicrostructure evolution during annealing and resulting final mechanical\\nproperties, but traditional partial differential equation-based methods are\\ncomputationally expensive, creating bottlenecks in materials design and\\nmanufacturing. In this work, we introduce a machine learning framework that\\ncombines a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory networks with an Autoencoder to\\nefficiently predict grain growth evolution. Our approach captures both spatial\\nand temporal aspects of grain evolution while encoding high-dimensional grain\\nstructure data into a compact latent space for pattern learning, enhanced by a\\nnovel composite loss function combining Mean Squared Error, Structural\\nSimilarity Index Measurement, and Boundary Preservation to maintain structural\\nintegrity of grain boundary topology of the prediction. Results demonstrated\\nthat our machine learning approach accelerates grain growth prediction by up to\\n\\\\SI{89}{\\\\times} faster, reducing computation time from \\\\SI{10}{\\\\minute} to\\napproximately \\\\SI{10}{\\\\second} while maintaining high-fidelity predictions. The\\nbest model (S-30-30) achieving a structural similarity score of\\n\\\\SI{86.71}{\\\\percent} and mean grain size error of just \\\\SI{0.07}{\\\\percent}. All\\nmodels accurately captured grain boundary topology, morphology, and size\\ndistributions. This approach enables rapid microstructural prediction for\\napplications where conventional simulations are prohibitively time-consuming,\\npotentially accelerating innovation in materials science and manufacturing.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:43:40Z\"}"}
