{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04932v1\", \"title\": \"Weighted Approximate Quantum Natural Gradient for Variational Quantum\\n  Eigensolver\", \"summary\": \"Variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is one of the most prominent algorithms\\nusing near-term quantum devices, designed to find the ground state of a\\nHamiltonian. In VQE, a classical optimizer iteratively updates the parameters\\nin the quantum circuit. Among various optimization methods, quantum natural\\ngradient descent (QNG) stands out as a promising optimization approach for VQE.\\nHowever, standard QNG only leverages the quantum Fisher information of the\\nentire system and treats each subsystem equally in the optimization process,\\nwithout accounting for the different weights and contributions of each\\nsubsystem corresponding to each observable. To address this limitation, we\\npropose a Weighted Approximate Quantum Natural Gradient (WA-QNG) method\\ntailored for $k$-local Hamiltonians. In this paper, we theoretically analyze\\nthe potential advantages of WA-QNG compared to QNG from three distinct\\nperspectives and reveal its connection with the Gauss-Newton method. We also\\nshow it outperforms standard quantum natural gradient descent in the numerical\\nexperiments for seeking the ground state of the Hamiltonian.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:18:09Z\"}"}
