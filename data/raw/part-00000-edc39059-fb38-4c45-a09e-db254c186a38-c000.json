{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21756v1\", \"title\": \"A Unified Framework for Diffusion Bridge Problems: Flow Matching and\\n  Schr\\u00f6dinger Matching into One\", \"summary\": \"The bridge problem is to find an SDE (or sometimes an ODE) that bridges two\\ngiven distributions. The application areas of the bridge problem are enormous,\\namong which the recent generative modeling (e.g., conditional or unconditional\\nimage generation) is the most popular. Also the famous Schr\\\\\\\"{o}dinger bridge\\nproblem, a widely known problem for a century, is a special instance of the\\nbridge problem. Two most popular algorithms to tackle the bridge problems in\\nthe deep learning era are: (conditional) flow matching and iterative fitting\\nalgorithms, where the former confined to ODE solutions, and the latter\\nspecifically for the Schr\\\\\\\"{o}dinger bridge problem. The main contribution of\\nthis article is in two folds: i) We provide concise reviews of these algorithms\\nwith technical details to some extent; ii) We propose a novel unified\\nperspective and framework that subsumes these seemingly unrelated algorithms\\n(and their variants) into one. In particular, we show that our unified\\nframework can instantiate the Flow Matching (FM) algorithm, the (mini-batch)\\noptimal transport FM algorithm, the (mini-batch) Schr\\\\\\\"{o}dinger bridge FM\\nalgorithm, and the deep Schr\\\\\\\"{o}dinger bridge matching (DSBM) algorithm as its\\nspecial cases. We believe that this unified framework will be useful for\\nviewing the bridge problems in a more general and flexible perspective, and in\\nturn can help researchers and practitioners to develop new bridge algorithms in\\ntheir fields.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:57:03Z\"}"}
