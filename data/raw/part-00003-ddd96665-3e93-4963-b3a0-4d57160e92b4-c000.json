We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer conic optimization, enabling\\nthe use of modern solvers for optimal solutions. To enhance computational\\nefficiency, we develop a safe screening based on Fenchel conjugates, thereby\\neffectively removing irrelevant features before optimization. Experiments on\\nsynthetic datasets demonstrate that our safe screening significantly reduces\\nthe problem size, leading to substantial improvements in computational time.\\nOur approach can solve Poisson regression problems with tens of thousands of\\nfeatures, exceeding the scale of previous studies. This work provides a\\nvaluable tool for interpretable feature selection in high-dimensional Poisson\\nregression.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T10:24:33Z\"}"}
