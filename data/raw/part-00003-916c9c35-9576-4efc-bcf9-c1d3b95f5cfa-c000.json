{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20017v1\", \"title\": \"Constructing Magic Squares: an integer linear programming model and a\\n  fast heuristic\", \"summary\": \"Magic squares are a fascinating mathematical challenge that has intrigued\\nmathematicians for centuries. Given a positive (and possibly large) integer\\n$n$, one of the main challenges that still remains is to find, within a\\nreliable computational time, a magic square of order $n$, that is, a square\\nmatrix of order $n$ with unique integers from $a_{\\\\min}$ to $a_{\\\\max}$, such\\nthat the sum of each row, column, and diagonal equals a constant $\\n\\\\mathcal{C}(A) $. In this work, we first present an Integer Linear Programming\\n(ILP) model for constructing a magic square of order $n$, which is formulated\\nas a feasibility problem. Nonetheless, the solution time of this ILP model\\ngrows exponentially as the order increases. To overcome this limitation, we\\nalso propose a heuristic that constructs magic squares depending on whether $n$\\nis odd, singly even, or doubly even. Our numerical results show that the\\nproposed heuristic can construct magic squares of order up to $70000$ in less\\nthan $140$ seconds, demonstrating its efficiency and scalability.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:35:55Z\"}"}
