Inverse\\ndynamics is a fundamental robotics problem, which maps from joint space to\\ntorque space of robotic systems. Traditional methods for solving it rely on\\ndirect physical modeling of robots which is difficult or even impossible due to\\nnonlinearity and external disturbance. Recently, data-based model-learning\\nalgorithms are adopted to address this issue. However, they often require\\nmanual parameter tuning and high computational costs. Neuromorphic computing is\\ninherently suitable to process spatiotemporal features in robot motion control\\nat extremely low costs. However, current research is still in its infancy:\\nexisting works control only low-degree-of-freedom systems and lack performance\\nquantification and comparison. In this paper, we propose a neuromorphic control\\nframework to control 7 degree-of-freedom robotic manipulators. We use Spiking\\nNeural Network to leverage the spatiotemporal continuity of the motion data to\\nimprove control accuracy, and eliminate manual parameters tuning. We validated\\nthe algorithm on two robotic platforms, which reduces torque prediction error\\nby at least 60% and performs a target position tracking task successfully. This\\nwork advances embodied neuromorphic control by one step forward from proof of\\nconcept to applications in complex real-world tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.NE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T07:13:37Z\"}"}
