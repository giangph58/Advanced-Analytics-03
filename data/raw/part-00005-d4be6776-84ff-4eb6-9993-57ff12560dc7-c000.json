{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00550v1\", \"title\": \"Bridging Cultural and Digital Divides: A Low-Latency JackTrip Framework\\n  for Equitable Music Education in the Global South\", \"summary\": \"The rapid expansion of digital technologies has transformed educational\\nlandscapes worldwide, yet significant infrastructural and cultural challenges\\npersist in the Global South. This paper introduces a low-latency JackTrip\\nframework designed to bridge both the cultural and digital divides in music\\neducation. By leveraging an open-source, UDP-based audio streaming protocol\\noriginally developed at Stanford's CCRMA, the framework is tailored to address\\ntechnical constraints such as intermittent connectivity, limited bandwidth, and\\nhigh latency that characterize many rural and underserved regions. The study\\nsystematically compares the performance of JackTrip with conventional platforms\\nlike Zoom, demonstrating that JackTrip achieves sub-30~ms latency under\\nsimulated low-resource conditions while preserving the intricate audio details\\nessential for non-Western musical traditions. Spectral analysis confirms that\\nJackTrip's superior handling of microtonal scales, complex rhythms, and\\nharmonic textures provides a culturally authentic medium for real-time ensemble\\nperformance and music education. These findings underscore the transformative\\npotential of decentralized, edge-computing solutions in empowering educators\\nand musicians across the Global South, promoting both technological equity and\\ncultural preservation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SD\", \"categories\": \"cs.SD,cs.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T14:27:47Z\"}"}
