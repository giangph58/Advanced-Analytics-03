{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16911v1\", \"title\": \"Dynamical tides in neutron stars with first-order phase transitions: the\\n  role of the discontinuity mode\", \"summary\": \"During the late stages of a binary neutron star inspiral, dynamical tides\\ninduced in each star by its companion become significant and should be included\\nin complete gravitational-wave (GW) modeling. We investigate the coupling\\nbetween the tidal field and quasi-normal modes in hybrid stars and show that\\nthe discontinuity mode ($g$-mode)--intrinsically associated with first-order\\nphase transitions and buoyancy--can rival the contribution of the fundamental\\n$f$-mode. We find that the $g$-mode overlap integral can reach up to $\\\\sim\\n10\\\\%$ of the $f$-mode value for hybrid star masses in the range\\n1.4-2.0$M_{\\\\odot}$, with the largest values generally associated with larger\\ndensity jumps. This leads to a GW phase shift due to the $g$-mode of $\\\\Delta\\n\\\\phi_g \\\\lesssim 0.1$-$1$ rad (i.e., up to $\\\\sim$5\\\\%-10\\\\% of $\\\\Delta \\\\phi_f$),\\nwith the largest shifts occurring for masses near the phase transition. At\\nhigher masses, the shifts remain smaller and nearly constant, with $\\\\Delta\\n\\\\phi_g \\\\lesssim 0.1$ rad (roughly $\\\\sim 1\\\\%$ of $\\\\Delta \\\\phi_f$). These GW\\nshifts may be relevant even at the design sensitivity of current\\nsecond-generation GW detectors in the most optimistic cases. Moreover, if a\\n$g$-mode is present and lies near the $f$-mode frequency, neglecting it in the\\nGW modeling can lead to systematic biases in neutron star parameter estimation,\\nresulting in radius errors of up to $1\\\\%-2\\\\%$. These results show the\\nimportance of dynamical tides to probe neutron stars' equation of state, and to\\ntest the existence of dense-matter phase transitions.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T17:38:45Z\"}"}
