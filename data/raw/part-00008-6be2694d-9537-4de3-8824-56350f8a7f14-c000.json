Rev. Lett.\\n134, 076401 (2025), in the following denoted PRL134. In this comment, we\\nrevisit and elaborate on the Adiabatic Ionization Model (AIM) for the energy\\nloss of antiparticles in matter, with particular reference to its theoretical\\nfoundation as established previously. The AIM framework plays a central role in\\ndescribing the ionization dynamics in the low-velocity regime considered by the\\nauthors of PRL134. Calculated AIM results for the energy loss of antiprotons in\\nLiF crystals are compared to experimental data and different other models,\\npointing to severe problems of the PRL134 results.\\n  Beyond this specific comparative theoretical investigation, we critically\\nexamine several statements and assumptions made in PRL134. Certain claims\\npresented therein appear to be inconsistent with established theoretical\\nprinciples or are insufficiently justified by the data and arguments provided.\\nAs such, we believe that further clarification, and in some cases, a more\\nrigorous justification, is necessary to substantiate those points.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.other\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.other,physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:49:37Z\"}"}
