{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16834v1\", \"title\": \"Improving Significant Wave Height Prediction Using Chronos Models\", \"summary\": \"Accurate wave height prediction is critical for maritime safety and coastal\\nresilience, yet conventional physics-based models and traditional machine\\nlearning methods face challenges in computational efficiency and nonlinear\\ndynamics modeling. This study introduces Chronos, the first implementation of a\\nlarge language model (LLM)-powered temporal architecture (Chronos) optimized\\nfor wave forecasting. Through advanced temporal pattern recognition applied to\\nhistorical wave data from three strategically chosen marine zones in the\\nNorthwest Pacific basin, our framework achieves multimodal improvements: (1)\\n14.3% reduction in training time with 2.5x faster inference speed compared to\\nPatchTST baselines, achieving 0.575 mean absolute scaled error (MASE) units;\\n(2) superior short-term forecasting (1-24h) across comprehensive metrics; (3)\\nsustained predictive leadership in extended-range forecasts (1-120h); and (4)\\ndemonstrated zero-shot capability maintaining median performance (rank 4/12)\\nagainst specialized operational models. This LLM-enhanced temporal modeling\\nparadigm establishes a new standard in wave prediction, offering both\\ncomputationally efficient solutions and a transferable framework for complex\\ngeophysical systems modeling.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,physics.ao-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:56:28Z\"}"}
