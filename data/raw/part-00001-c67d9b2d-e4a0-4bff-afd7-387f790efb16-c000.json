{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14865v1\", \"title\": \"Mapping Emotional Feeling in the Body: A Tripartite Framework for\\n  Understanding the Embodied Mind\", \"summary\": \"People often speak of being \\\"moved beyond words\\\" when witnessing\\nawe-inspiring natural beauty, experiencing profound moral elevation, or\\nencountering powerful works of art and music. Such moments evoke intensely\\nembodied sensations - a swelling in the chest, a quickened heartbeat, or a\\nsudden stillness that floods the entire body. These experiences are difficult\\nto articulate, yet they are vividly real and spatially anchored in bodily\\nexperience. This review examines the emerging method of body mapping, which\\ncaptures how individuals subjectively localize emotional sensations across the\\nbody. Drawing on over two dozen empirical studies, we propose a tripartite\\nframework for understanding the origins of emotional bodily maps: (1) bottom-up\\nphysiological signals, (2) top-down behavioral engagement (including motor\\nactions), and (3) conceptual and metaphorical constructions. Crucially, we\\nargue that bodily maps are not mere reflections of physiological monitoring,\\nbut expressive interfaces between brain, body, and conceptualization. Because\\nthey rely on introspective sensation rather than verbal articulation, bodily\\nmaps offer a promising language-independent tool for assessing emotional\\nexperience - particularly in cross-cultural research, developmental studies,\\nand clinical contexts where verbal reporting may be limited or unreliable.\\nUltimately, bodily maps reveal the hidden geography of emotion-those feelings\\nthat elude precise definition or verbalization, like being moved beyond words,\\nyet are undeniably real and embodied - offering a compelling window into how\\nemotions are formed, shared, and lived through the body.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.NC\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.NC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T05:26:05Z\"}"}
