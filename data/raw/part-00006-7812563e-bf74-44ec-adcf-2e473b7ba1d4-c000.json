In this work, we develop a formulation to\\nexplicitly introduce the compact quark state contribution in the hadronic\\npotentials together with the direct four-point interaction. We derive analytic\\nexpressions of the compositeness from the effective potential between hadrons\\nwhen the system has a bound state. Applying this formulation to the $X(3872)$,\\nwe examine the variation of the compositeness with respect to the binding\\nenergy, energy of $\\\\chi_{c1}(2P)$, cutoff momentum, and strength of the direct\\n$D^0\\\\bar{D}^{*0}$ interaction.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T04:22:26Z\"}"}
