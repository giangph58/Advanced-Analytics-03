We\\ninvestigate these effects in the X-ray emission of the Intermediate Polar IGR\\nJ17195-4100 by carrying out the X-ray spectral analysis, spin modulation and\\nhardness ratio. We present high-sensitivity broadband X-ray spectral analysis\\nby combining NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations in the 0.3-78.0 keV energy\\nrange. The X-ray spectral analysis is performed using six composite models,\\nincluding the angle-dependent reflection model (reflect), multi-temperature\\nplasma emission models (CEVMKL, MKCFLOW), and photoionised and/or neutral\\npartially covering absorption models (zxipcf, pcfabs) within XSPEC. We examine\\nalso the spin modulation in four energy ranges and the hardness ratio, to\\ndetermine the absorption and scattering effects. We find that the spectrum is\\nbest modelled with a reflection amplitude ($\\\\Omega$) of 0.58\\n$^{+0.38}_{-0.26}$, an ionisation parameter, log($\\\\xi$), of\\n1.46$^{+0.44}_{-0.23}$ with an equivalent hydrogen column density of\\n3.09$^{+2.26}_{-0.68}$ $\\\\times$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, a neutral absorber, and a\\nmulti-temperature plasma temperature of 27.14$^{+2.0}_{-2.13}$ keV. In\\naddition, we detect effects of electron scattering in the NuSTAR band, leading\\nto modulation amplitude of about a steady 9$\\\\%$ that increases up to 15$\\\\%$\\nafter 20 keV. We stress that these effects significantly affect the X-ray\\nemission of intermediate polars and should be considered to obtain a good\\nrepresentation of the intrinsic spectrum.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T16:35:08Z\"}"}
