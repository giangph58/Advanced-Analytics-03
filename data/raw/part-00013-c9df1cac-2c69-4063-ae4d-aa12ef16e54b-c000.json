{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02765v1\", \"title\": \"Robot-Led Vision Language Model Wellbeing Assessment of Children\", \"summary\": \"This study presents a novel robot-led approach to assessing children's mental\\nwellbeing using a Vision Language Model (VLM). Inspired by the Child\\nApperception Test (CAT), the social robot NAO presented children with pictorial\\nstimuli to elicit their verbal narratives of the images, which were then\\nevaluated by a VLM in accordance with CAT assessment guidelines. The VLM's\\nassessments were systematically compared to those provided by a trained\\npsychologist. The results reveal that while the VLM demonstrates moderate\\nreliability in identifying cases with no wellbeing concerns, its ability to\\naccurately classify assessments with clinical concern remains limited.\\nMoreover, although the model's performance was generally consistent when\\nprompted with varying demographic factors such as age and gender, a\\nsignificantly higher false positive rate was observed for girls, indicating\\npotential sensitivity to gender attribute. These findings highlight both the\\npromise and the challenges of integrating VLMs into robot-led assessments of\\nchildren's wellbeing.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T17:02:09Z\"}"}
