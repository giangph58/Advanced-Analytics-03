{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05076v1\", \"title\": \"Content-Distortion High-Order Interaction for Blind Image Quality\\n  Assessment\", \"summary\": \"The content and distortion are widely recognized as the two primary factors\\naffecting the visual quality of an image. While existing No-Reference Image\\nQuality Assessment (NR-IQA) methods have modeled these factors, they fail to\\ncapture the complex interactions between content and distortions. This\\nshortfall impairs their ability to accurately perceive quality. To confront\\nthis, we analyze the key properties required for interaction modeling and\\npropose a robust NR-IQA approach termed CoDI-IQA (Content-Distortion high-order\\nInteraction for NR-IQA), which aggregates local distortion and global content\\nfeatures within a hierarchical interaction framework. Specifically, a\\nProgressive Perception Interaction Module (PPIM) is proposed to explicitly\\nsimulate how content and distortions independently and jointly influence image\\nquality. By integrating internal interaction, coarse interaction, and fine\\ninteraction, it achieves high-order interaction modeling that allows the model\\nto properly represent the underlying interaction patterns. To ensure sufficient\\ninteraction, multiple PPIMs are employed to hierarchically fuse multi-level\\ncontent and distortion features at different granularities. We also tailor a\\ntraining strategy suited for CoDI-IQA to maintain interaction stability.\\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method notably outperforms\\nthe state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy, data efficiency,\\nand generalization ability.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:44:30Z\"}"}
