This\\nwork investigates the production of quantum coherence in adiabatic evolution\\naccelerated by counterdiabatic driving within the framework of counterdiabatic\\nquantum computing. Specifically, we analyze different orders in the nested\\ncommutator expansion for approximated counterdiabatic drivings for three cases:\\na weighted max-cut problem, a 4-local Hamiltonian, and a non-stoquastic\\nHamiltonian. Our findings reveal that the hierarchy introduced by coherence\\nproduction correlates with the success probability in the impulse regime. This\\nsuggests that protocols increasing coherence during evolution enhance\\nperformance in adiabatic evolution driven by counterdiabatic techniques. We\\nshow that large quantum coherence also means large energy fluctuation during\\nevolution, which is associated with the speed of evolution, paving the way for\\ndesigning superior algorithms in counterdiabatic quantum computing.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:12:49Z\"}"}
