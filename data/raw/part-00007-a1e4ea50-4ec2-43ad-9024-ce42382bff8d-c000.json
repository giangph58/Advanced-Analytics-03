This study systematically examines kHz QPOs, their\\nvariability, and their connection to spectral properties in $4U 1636-536$ using\\nAstroSat data. Our analysis tracks the source transition from hard to soft\\nstates in the hardness-intensity diagram. Broad spectral analysis (0.7-25 keV)\\nusing SXT and LAXPC data indicates a spectrum shaped by reflection from a\\nthermal corona, with contributions from boundary layer emission and a soft disk\\ncomponent. We find significant changes in optical depth, blackbody temperature,\\nand inner disk temperature that likely drive state transitions. Power density\\nspectra reveal three variability types: a low frequency QPO (LFQPOs) (~30 Hz),\\nand two simultaneous kHz QPOs. The LFQPOs and the upper kHz QPOs appear more\\nprominently in soft spectral states. The presence of LFQPOs and twin kHz QPOs\\nin soft spectral states enable us to estimate the neutron star mass at (2.37\\n$\\\\pm$ 0.02) $M_\\\\odot$ using the relativistic precession model (RPM).\\nAdditionally, time-lag and root mean square (rms) analysis provide insights\\ninto the size of the corona and the radiative origin of these variability\\ncomponents.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T17:31:36Z\"}"}
