{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03655v1\", \"title\": \"Counterfactual Inference for Eliminating Sentiment Bias in Recommender\\n  Systems\", \"summary\": \"Recommender Systems (RSs) aim to provide personalized recommendations for\\nusers. A newly discovered bias, known as sentiment bias, uncovers a common\\nphenomenon within Review-based RSs (RRSs): the recommendation accuracy of users\\nor items with negative reviews deteriorates compared with users or items with\\npositive reviews. Critical users and niche items are disadvantaged by such\\nunfair recommendations. We study this problem from the perspective of\\ncounterfactual inference with two stages. At the model training stage, we build\\na causal graph and model how sentiment influences the final rating score.\\nDuring the inference stage, we decouple the direct and indirect effects to\\nmitigate the impact of sentiment bias and remove the indirect effect using\\ncounterfactual inference. We have conducted extensive experiments, and the\\nresults validate that our model can achieve comparable performance on rating\\nprediction for better recommendations and effective mitigation of sentiment\\nbias. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to employ\\ncounterfactual inference on sentiment bias mitigation in RSs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T16:00:41Z\"}"}
