When these modes are suitably decoupled, we are able to obtain an\\nexact formula for the two point functions of the boundary current and\\nenergy-momentum tensor in terms of the quasinormal modes of this channel. This\\nexact formula is a simple modification of the previous version of the product\\nformula. We also obtain a similar formula for the case involving a boundary\\nglobal R-symmetry anomaly, when we have a bulk Chern-Simons term which\\nintroduces additional couplings in the shear channel. Also based on insights\\nfrom the quasinormal mode spectrum, we report on an instability as well as the\\npresence of high momentum long-lived modes associated with large values of the\\nanomaly coefficient.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T17:58:16Z\"}"}
