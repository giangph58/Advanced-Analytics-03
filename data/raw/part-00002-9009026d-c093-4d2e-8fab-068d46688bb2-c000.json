{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15230v1\", \"title\": \"Rydberg Atoms in a Ladder Geometry: Quench Dynamics and Floquet\\n  Engineering\", \"summary\": \"In recent days, Rydberg atom quantum simulator platforms have emerged as\\nnovel quantum simulators for physical systems ranging from condensed matter to\\nparticle physics. On a fundamental level, these platforms allow for a direct\\ntest of our understanding of the emergence of quantum statistical mechanics\\nstarting from the laws of quantum dynamics. In this paper, we investigate the\\nfate of quantum dynamics in a model of Rydberg atoms arranged in a square\\nladder geometry, with a Rabi frequency $2\\\\Omega$ and a detuning profile which\\nis staggered along the longer direction with amplitude $\\\\Delta$. As the\\nstaggering strength $\\\\Delta$ is tuned from $\\\\Delta/\\\\Omega=0\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty$,\\nthe model exhibits a wide class of dynamical phenomena, ranging from (i)\\nquantum many-body scars (QMBS) ($\\\\Delta/\\\\Omega \\\\sim 0,1$), (ii) integrability\\ninduced slow dynamics and approximate Krylov fractures ($\\\\Delta/\\\\Omega \\\\gg 1$)\\n. Additionally, by leveraging the underlying chiral nature of the spectrum of\\nthis model Hamiltonian, it is possible to design Floquet protocols leading to\\ndynamical signatures reminiscent of discrete time-crystalline order and exact\\nFloquet flat bands. Finally, we study the robustness of these dynamical\\nfeatures against imperfections in the implementation of the Floquet protocols,\\nlong-range van der Waals interactions and inevitable influences from the\\nenvironment in the form of pure dephasing and the finite lifetime of the\\nRydberg excited state.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T17:00:44Z\"}"}
