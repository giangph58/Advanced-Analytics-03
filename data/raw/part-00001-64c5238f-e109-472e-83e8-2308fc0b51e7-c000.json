Motivated by recent tensions in the natal kick velocity distribution and\\nBH mass distribution of BH-LMXBs, we revisit the spatial distribution of the\\nGalactic BH-LMXBs using a new set of distance measurements obtained from an\\nX-ray spectral modelling framework that we introduced in earlier work. We\\nperform a multiparameter simulation study to mitigate part of the bias present\\nin our prior estimates and gain insights into possible observational selection\\neffects that affect the observed population. We derive a bias correction\\nfactor, well described by a Pareto probability density function that closely\\nfollows an inverse-square law dependence on distance. We then construct a\\nbias-corrected, literature-independent, Galactic spatial distribution that\\nclearly traces spiral arm structures and shows a deficit of sources very close\\nto the Galactic centre, which might be explained due to high extinction or a\\ntrue paucity of these sources at that region. Further analysis of the\\nsimulation results provides hints for a hidden population of BH-LMXBs at low\\nGalactic heights. Lastly, we estimate the root-mean-squared Galactic height and\\nfind that it is most compatible with a hybrid scenario of BH formation, with\\nsome BHs receiving high natal kicks and thus propelled further from the thin\\ndisc plane while others receiving low natal kicks and remaining close to their\\nbirth place.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T07:45:41Z\"}"}
