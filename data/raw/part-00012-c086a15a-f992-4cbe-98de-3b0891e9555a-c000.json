{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00495v1\", \"title\": \"Enhancing Tropical Cyclone Path Forecasting with an Improved Transformer\\n  Network\", \"summary\": \"A storm is a type of extreme weather. Therefore, forecasting the path of a\\nstorm is extremely important for protecting human life and property. However,\\nstorm forecasting is very challenging because storm trajectories frequently\\nchange. In this study, we propose an improved deep learning method using a\\nTransformer network to predict the movement trajectory of a storm over the next\\n6 hours. The storm data used to train the model was obtained from the National\\nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [1]. Simulation results show that\\nthe proposed method is more accurate than traditional methods. Moreover, the\\nproposed method is faster and more cost-effective\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.PF\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T12:48:34Z\"}"}
