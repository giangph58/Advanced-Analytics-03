{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00677v1\", \"title\": \"Linear Parameter Varying Attitude Control For CubeSats Using\\n  Electrospray Thrusters\", \"summary\": \"This paper proposes the design of a single linear parameter-varying (LPV)\\ncontroller for the attitude control of CubeSats using electro spray thrusters.\\nCubeSat attitude control based on electro spray thrusters faces two main\\nchallenges. Firstly, the thruster can only generate a small control torque\\nleading to easily saturating the actuation system. Secondly, CubeSats need to\\noperate multiple different maneuvers from large to small slews to pointing\\ntasks. LPV control is ideally suitable to address these challenges. The\\nproposed design follows a mixed-sensitivity control scheme. The\\nparameter-varying weights depend on the attitude error and are derived from the\\nperformance and robustness requirements of individual typical CubeSat\\nmaneuvers. The controller is synthesized by minimizing the induced L2-norm of\\nthe closed-loop interconnections between the controller and weighted plant. The\\nperformance and robustness of the controller is demonstrated on a simulation of\\nthe MIT Space Propulsion Lab's Magnetic Levitation CubeSat Testbed.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T17:33:36Z\"}"}
