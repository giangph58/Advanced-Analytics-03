A particularly relevant application\\nis the matching of near-infrared (NIR) images to visible-spectrum (VIS) images,\\nenabling the verification of individuals by comparing NIR facial captures\\nacquired with VIS reference images. The use of NIR imaging offers several\\nadvantages, including greater robustness to illumination variations, better\\nvisibility through glasses and glare, and greater resistance to presentation\\nattacks. Despite these claimed benefits, the robustness of NIR-based systems\\nagainst presentation attacks has not been systematically studied in the\\nliterature. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation into the\\nvulnerability of NIR-VIS cross-spectral face recognition systems to\\npresentation attacks. Our empirical findings indicate that, although these\\nsystems exhibit a certain degree of reliability, they remain vulnerable to\\nspecific attacks, emphasizing the need for further research in this area.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T08:15:48Z\"}"}
