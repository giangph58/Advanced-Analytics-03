While\\nexisting research primarily focuses on reducing estimation errors, it largely\\nneglects robustness and security aspects, leaving these systems vulnerable to\\nadversarial attacks. To address this significant challenge, we propose the\\n\\\\textbf{Tangible Attack (TBA)}, a novel framework designed to generate\\nadversarial examples capable of effectively compromising any digital human\\ngeneration model. Our approach introduces a \\\\textbf{Dual Heterogeneous Noise\\nGenerator (DHNG)}, which leverages Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and\\nControlNet to produce diverse, targeted noise tailored to the original image\\nfeatures. Additionally, we design a custom \\\\textbf{adversarial loss function}\\nto optimize the noise, ensuring both high controllability and potent\\ndisruption. By iteratively refining the adversarial sample through\\nmulti-gradient signals from both the noise and the state-of-the-art EHPS model,\\nTBA substantially improves the effectiveness of adversarial attacks. Extensive\\nexperiments demonstrate TBA's superiority, achieving a remarkable 41.0\\\\%\\nincrease in estimation error, with an average improvement of approximately\\n17.0\\\\%. These findings expose significant security vulnerabilities in current\\nEHPS models and highlight the need for stronger defenses in digital human\\ngeneration systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T11:42:10Z\"}"}
