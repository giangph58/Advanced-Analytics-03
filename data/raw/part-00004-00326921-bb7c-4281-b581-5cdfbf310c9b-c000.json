But the\\nconversion procedure in any case assigns a right-handed antineutrino to each\\nelectron, which leads to the superiority of the theoretical rate of inverse\\nbeta decays over the experimental one. The right-handed antineutrino is\\nproduced in the mode of beta decay of the nucleus due to the standard\\nelectroweak interaction. The left-handed antineutrino appears in the mode\\ncaused by the existence of a interaction, the carrier of which is a massless\\npseudoscalar boson having a Yukawa coupling with the electron neutrino and\\nnucleons. The emission of such a boson from a virtual right-handed antineutrino\\nconverts it into a free left-handed antineutrino.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T11:51:23Z\"}"}
