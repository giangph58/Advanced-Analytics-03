{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05770v1\", \"title\": \"A Lightweight Multi-Module Fusion Approach for Korean Character\\n  Recognition\", \"summary\": \"Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is essential in applications such as\\ndocument processing, license plate recognition, and intelligent surveillance.\\nHowever, existing OCR models often underperform in real-world scenarios due to\\nirregular text layouts, poor image quality, character variability, and high\\ncomputational costs.\\n  This paper introduces SDA-Net (Stroke-Sensitive Attention and Dynamic Context\\nEncoding Network), a lightweight and efficient architecture designed for robust\\nsingle-character recognition. SDA-Net incorporates: (1) a Dual Attention\\nMechanism to enhance stroke-level and spatial feature extraction; (2) a Dynamic\\nContext Encoding module that adaptively refines semantic information using a\\nlearnable gating mechanism; (3) a U-Net-inspired Feature Fusion Strategy for\\ncombining low-level and high-level features; and (4) a highly optimized\\nlightweight backbone that reduces memory and computational demands.\\n  Experimental results show that SDA-Net achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on\\nchallenging OCR benchmarks, with significantly faster inference, making it\\nwell-suited for deployment in real-time and edge-based OCR systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI,I.2.10\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T07:50:19Z\"}"}
