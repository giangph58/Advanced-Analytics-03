{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07011v1\", \"title\": \"FAME: Introducing Fuzzy Additive Models for Explainable AI\", \"summary\": \"In this study, we introduce the Fuzzy Additive Model (FAM) and FAM with\\nExplainability (FAME) as a solution for Explainable Artificial Intelligence\\n(XAI). The family consists of three layers: (1) a Projection Layer that\\ncompresses the input space, (2) a Fuzzy Layer built upon Single Input-Single\\nOutput Fuzzy Logic Systems (SFLS), where SFLS functions as subnetworks within\\nan additive index model, and (3) an Aggregation Layer. This architecture\\nintegrates the interpretability of SFLS, which uses human-understandable\\nif-then rules, with the explainability of input-output relationships,\\nleveraging the additive model structure. Furthermore, using SFLS inherently\\naddresses issues such as the curse of dimensionality and rule explosion. To\\nfurther improve interpretability, we propose a method for sculpting antecedent\\nspace within FAM, transforming it into FAME. We show that FAME captures the\\ninput-output relationships with fewer active rules, thus improving clarity. To\\nlearn the FAM family, we present a deep learning framework. Through the\\npresented comparative results, we demonstrate the promising potential of FAME\\nin reducing model complexity while retaining interpretability, positioning it\\nas a valuable tool for XAI.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T16:29:55Z\"}"}
