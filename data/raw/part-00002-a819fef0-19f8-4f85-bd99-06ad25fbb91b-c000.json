This instrument offers\\nseveral resolutions from 20,000 in first order using a 50 $\\\\mu$m fiber, to\\n100,000 in second order in the near infrared. Precise radial-velocity\\nmeasurements are made possible by simultaneous wavelength calibration. Combined\\nwith the 40-cm Meade telescope located at our facilities, a limiting magnitude\\nof 6 is reached. This instrument is a considerable improvement over its\\npredecessor in throughput, reliability and ease.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T04:39:20Z\"}"}
