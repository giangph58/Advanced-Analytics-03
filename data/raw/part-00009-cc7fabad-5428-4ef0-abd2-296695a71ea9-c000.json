We observe that the two-color fields generally outperform the\\nsingle-color 800~nm field by factors of 2 to 3800, depending on the photon\\nenergy and generation scheme. From this comparison, we determine which scheme\\nis optimal for each photon energy. We also observe that the divergence of HHG\\nproduced by the 800--266~nm laser fields is smaller than that of the other\\nsingle- and two-color driving fields, perhaps suggesting that the 800--266~nm\\nfields optimize the recombination probability of the so-called ``short\\\"\\nelectron trajectories.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,physics.app-ph,physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T17:56:57Z\"}"}
