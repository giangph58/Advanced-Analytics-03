{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02817v1\", \"title\": \"Efficient Autoregressive Shape Generation via Octree-Based Adaptive\\n  Tokenization\", \"summary\": \"Many 3D generative models rely on variational autoencoders (VAEs) to learn\\ncompact shape representations. However, existing methods encode all shapes into\\na fixed-size token, disregarding the inherent variations in scale and\\ncomplexity across 3D data. This leads to inefficient latent representations\\nthat can compromise downstream generation. We address this challenge by\\nintroducing Octree-based Adaptive Tokenization, a novel framework that adjusts\\nthe dimension of latent representations according to shape complexity. Our\\napproach constructs an adaptive octree structure guided by a\\nquadric-error-based subdivision criterion and allocates a shape latent vector\\nto each octree cell using a query-based transformer. Building upon this\\ntokenization, we develop an octree-based autoregressive generative model that\\neffectively leverages these variable-sized representations in shape generation.\\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our approach reduces token counts by 50%\\ncompared to fixed-size methods while maintaining comparable visual quality.\\nWhen using a similar token length, our method produces significantly\\nhigher-quality shapes. When incorporated with our downstream generative model,\\nour method creates more detailed and diverse 3D content than existing\\napproaches.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T17:57:52Z\"}"}
