{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17321v1\", \"title\": \"Dargana: fine-tuning EarthPT for dynamic tree canopy mapping from space\", \"summary\": \"We present Dargana, a fine-tuned variant of the EarthPT time-series\\nfoundation model that achieves specialisation using <3% of its pre-training\\ndata volume and 5% of its pre-training compute. Dargana is fine-tuned to\\ngenerate regularly updated classification of tree canopy cover at 10m\\nresolution, distinguishing conifer and broadleaved tree types. Using Cornwall,\\nUK, as a test case, the model achieves a pixel-level ROC-AUC of 0.98 and a\\nPR-AUC of 0.83 on unseen satellite imagery. Dargana can identify fine\\nstructures like hedgerows and coppice below the training sample limit, and can\\ntrack temporal changes to canopy cover such as new woodland establishment. Our\\nresults demonstrate how pre-trained Large Observation Models like EarthPT can\\nbe specialised for granular, dynamic land cover monitoring from space,\\nproviding a valuable, scalable tool for natural capital management and\\nconservation.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.geo-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.geo-ph,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T07:23:27Z\"}"}
