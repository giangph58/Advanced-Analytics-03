We identify the parameter space in\\nwhich the collapse of the spherical overdensity is prevented by the scalar\\nfield turning imaginary at some moment, which allows us to place constraints on\\nthe model parameters. We show how the collapse time and the critical density\\ncontrast depend on the EFT parameters. To assess the observational\\nimplications, we compute the halo mass function using the Press-Schechter\\nformalism. We find that the number density of halos is suppressed compared to\\nthe $\\\\Lambda$CDM model due to ``beyond Horndeski'' effects, upon imposing the\\nstability of linear perturbations.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T05:33:55Z\"}"}
