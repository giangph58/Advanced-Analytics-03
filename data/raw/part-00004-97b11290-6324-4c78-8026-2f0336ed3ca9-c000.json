{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17694v1\", \"title\": \"Using mathematical models of heart cells to assess the safety of new\\n  pharmaceutical drugs\", \"summary\": \"Many drugs have been withdrawn from the market worldwide, at a cost of\\nbillions of dollars, because of patient fatalities due to them unexpectedly\\ndisturbing heart rhythm. Even drugs for ailments as mild as hay fever have been\\nwithdrawn due to an unacceptable increase in risk of these heart rhythm\\ndisturbances. Consequently, the whole pharmaceutical industry expends a huge\\neffort in checking all new drugs for any unwanted side effects on the heart.\\nThe predominant root cause has been identified as drug molecules blocking ionic\\ncurrent flows in the heart. Block of individual types of ionic currents can now\\nbe measured experimentally at an early stage of drug development, and this is\\nthe standard screening approach for a number of ion currents in many large\\npharmaceutical companies. However, clinical risk is a complex function of the\\ndegree of block of many different types of cardiac ion currents, and this is\\ndifficult to understand by looking at results of these screens independently.\\nBy using ordinary differential equation models for the electrical activity of\\nheart cells (electrophysiology models) we can integrate information from\\ndifferent types of currents, to predict the effect on whole heart cells and\\nsubsequent risk of side effects. The resulting simulations can provide a more\\naccurate summary of the risk of a drug earlier in development and hence more\\ncheaply than the pre-existing approaches.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.CB\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.CB,q-bio.SC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T16:03:06Z\"}"}
