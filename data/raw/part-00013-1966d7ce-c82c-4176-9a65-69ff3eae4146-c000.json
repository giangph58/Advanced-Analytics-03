This assumption is referred to as the\\nadmissibility condition. However, the admissibility condition always ensures\\nthe Bianchi identity, and thus prohibits the existence of magnetic objects such\\nas the 't~Hooft line. Recently, in 2D compact scalar field theory,\\nRef.~\\\\cite{Abe:2023uan} proposed a method to define magnetic objects without\\nviolating the admissibility condition by introducing holes into the lattice. In\\nthis paper, we extend this ``excision method'' to 4D Maxwell theory and propose\\na new definition of the 't~Hooft line on the lattice. Using this definition, we\\nfirst demonstrate a lattice counterpart of the Witten effect which endows the\\n't~Hooft line with electric charge and make it a dyon. Furthermore, we show\\nthat by interpreting the 't~Hooft line as a boundary of the lattice system, the\\nstatistics of the dyon can be directly read off. We also explain how the dyonic\\noperator which satisfies the Dirac quantization condition becomes a genuine\\nloop operator even at finite lattice spacings.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-lat\", \"categories\": \"hep-lat\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T08:39:57Z\"}"}
