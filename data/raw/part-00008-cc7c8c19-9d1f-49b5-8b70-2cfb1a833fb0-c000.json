The model\\nproblem is reformulated using an entropy variable to guarantee solution\\npositivity, boundedness, and satisfaction of a discrete entropy-stability\\ninequality at the numerical level. The scheme combines a local discontinuous\\nGalerkin method on polytopal meshes for the space discretization with a\\n$\\\\nu$-step backward differentiation formula for the time integration.\\nImplementation details are discussed, including a detailed derivation of the\\nlinear systems arising from Newton's iteration. The accuracy and robustness of\\nthe proposed method are demonstrated through extensive numerical tests.\\nFinally, the method's practical performance is demonstrated through simulations\\nof \\\\textalpha{}-synuclein propagation in a two-dimensional brain geometry\\nsegmented from MRI data, providing a relevant computational framework for\\nmodeling synucleopathies (such as Parkinson's disease) and, more generally,\\nneurodegenerative diseases.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T08:10:42Z\"}"}
