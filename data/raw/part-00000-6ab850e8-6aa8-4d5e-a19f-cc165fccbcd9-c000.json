The outburst from February to March\\nof 2021 can be divided into three stages: the low hard state (LHS), the hard\\nintermediate state (HIMS) and soft intermediate state (SIMS). In the PDSs of\\nthe LHS and HIMS, the broad-band noises are well fitted with three Lorentzian\\ncomponents: a low-frequency component $L_1$, a middle-frequency component $L_2$\\nand a high-frequency component $L_3$. The increasing trend of the\\ncharacteristic frequencies for $L_1$ and $L_2$ and the relation between the QPO\\nfrequency and characteristic BBN frequency are reported. We found that the\\nenergies corresponding to the peaks and shapes of the rms spectra for three BBN\\ncomponents are different. The comparison among three BBN components indicates\\nthat energy-dominant bands of these BBN components are distinct. Our results\\ncan be explained with the truncated disc/hot flow model with a large variable\\ndisc and a small hot inner flow. A possible description of the accretion\\nstructure and its evolution from the LHS to the SIMS is proposed. Further\\nresearch is still required to probe such accretion structure in GX 339--4.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T06:27:11Z\"}"}
