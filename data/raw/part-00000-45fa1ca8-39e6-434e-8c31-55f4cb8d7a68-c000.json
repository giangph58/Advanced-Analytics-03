We focus on two NP-Hard problems, including the\\nTraveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows and the Capacitated Vehicle\\nRouting Problem with Time Windows. We utilize D-Wave's Quantum Annealer and\\nConstrained Quadratic Model (CQM) solver within a hybrid framework to solve\\nthese problems. We demonstrate that while the CQM solver effectively minimizes\\nroute costs, it struggles to maintain time window feasibility as the problem\\nsize increases. To address this limitation, we implement a heuristic method\\nthat fixes infeasible solutions through a series of swapping operations.\\nTesting on benchmark instances shows our method achieves promising results with\\nan average optimality gap of 3.86%.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.ET\", \"categories\": \"cs.ET,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:32:40Z\"}"}
