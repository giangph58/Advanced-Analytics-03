However, existing researches have predominantly focused on raw\\nperformance gains, with little attention paid to quantifying the\\ntransferability of architectural components. In this paper, we introduce the\\nconcept of \\\"Universality\\\" and its associated definitions which extend the\\ntraditional notion of \\\"Generalization\\\" to encompass the modules' ease of\\ntransferability, thus revealing the relationships between module universality\\nand model generalizability. Then we propose the Universality Assessment\\nEquation (UAE), a metric for quantifying how readily a given module could be\\ntransplanted across models. Guided by the UAE results of standard residual\\nblocks and other plug-and-play modules, we further design two optimized\\nmodules, Cycle Residual Block (CRB) and Depth-Wise Cycle Residual Block (DCRB).\\nThrough comprehensive experiments on natural-scene benchmarks, remote-sensing\\ndatasets, extreme-industrial imagery and on-device deployments, we demonstrate\\nthat networks embedded with the proposed plug-and-play modules outperform\\nseveral state-of-the-arts, reaching a PSNR enhancement of up to 0.83dB or\\nenabling a 71.3% reduction in parameters with negligible loss in reconstruction\\nfidelity.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T13:35:59Z\"}"}
