{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02538v1\", \"title\": \"Detection of Deuterated Hydrocarbon Nanoparticles in the Whirlpool\\n  Galaxy, M51\", \"summary\": \"Deuteration of hydrocarbon material, including polycyclic aromatic\\nhydrocarbons (PAHs), has been proposed to account for the low gas-phase\\nabundances of D in the interstellar medium. JWST spectra of four star-forming\\nregions in M51 show an emission feature, with central wavelength\\n$\\\\sim$4.647$\\\\mu$m and FWHM 0.0265$\\\\mu$m, corresponding to the C-D stretching\\nmode in aliphatic hydrocarbons. The emitting aliphatic material is estimated to\\nhave (D/H)$_{\\\\rm aliph}\\\\approx 0.17\\\\pm0.02$ -- a factor $\\\\sim$$10^4$ enrichment\\nrelative to the overall interstellar medium (ISM). On $\\\\sim$$50\\\\,$pc scales,\\ndeuteration levels toward four H$\\\\,$II regions in M51 are 2-3 times higher than\\nin the Orion Bar photodissociation region (PDR), with implications for the\\nprocesses responsible for the formation and evolution of hydrocarbon\\nnanoparticles, including PAHs. The deuteration of the aliphatic material is\\nfound to anticorrelate with helium ionization in the associated H$\\\\,$II,\\nsuggesting that harsh FUV radiation may act to lower the deuteration of\\naliphatics in PDRs near massive stars. No evidence is found for deuteration of\\naromatic material, with (D/H)$_{\\\\rm arom} \\\\lesssim 0.016$: deuteration of the\\naliphatic material exceeds that of the aromatic material by at least a factor\\n10. The observed levels of deuteration may account for the depletion of D\\nobserved in the Galactic interstellar medium. If so, the $4.65\\\\mu$m feature may\\nbe detectable in absorption.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T12:39:47Z\"}"}
