{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15272v1\", \"title\": \"Superheavy dark matter from the natural inflation in light of the\\n  highest-energy astroparticle events\", \"summary\": \"Superheavy dark matter has been attractive as a candidate of particle dark\\nmatter. We propose a \\\"natural\\\" particle model, in which the dark matter serves\\nas the inflaton in natural inflation, while decaying to high-energy particles\\nat energies of $10^{9}-10^{13} \\\\, \\\\text{GeV}$ from the prediction of the\\ninflation. A scalar field responsible to dilute the dark matter abundance\\nrevives the natural inflation. Since the dark matter must be a spin zero\\nscalar, we study carefully the galactic dark matter 3-body decay into fermions\\nand two body decays into a gluon pair, and point out relevant multi-messenger\\nbounds that constrain these decay modes. Interestingly, the predicted energy\\nscale may coincide with the AMATERASU event and/or the KM3NeT neutrino event,\\nKM3-230213A. We also point out particle models with dark baryon to further\\nalleviate $\\\\gamma$-ray bounds. This scenario yields several testable\\npredictions for the UHECR observations, including the highest-energy neutrons\\nthat are unaffected by magnetic fields, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the running\\nof spectral indices, $\\\\alpha_s\\\\gtrsim\\\\mathcal{O}(0.001)$, and the existence of\\nlight new colored particles that could be accessible at future collider\\nexperiments. Further measurements of high energy cosmic rays, including their\\ncomponents and detailed coordinates may provide insight into not only the\\norigin of the cosmic rays but also inflation.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T17:57:50Z\"}"}
