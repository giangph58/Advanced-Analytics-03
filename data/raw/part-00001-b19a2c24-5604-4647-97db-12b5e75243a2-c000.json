In this process,\\nthe characteristics of the 2D electron dynamics at the diffraction screen can\\nbe imprinted to the generated harmonics, which provides abundant opportunities\\nfor manipulating light-matter interaction. In this work, we study single-slit\\ndiffraction of a high-intensity spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) - a beam\\ncarrying transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM). We demonstrate that due to\\nthe spatiotemporal structure of the driver, it induces differential electron\\noscillations on the screen, which conveys the transverse OAM to the high-order\\nharmonic STOV beams. As a result, the topological charges of the harmonic beams\\nare $l = nl_0$, where $l_0$ is the topological charge of the fundamental\\ndriving light, and $n$ is the harmonic order. In addition, we show that by\\ncontrolling the slit angle with respect to the driver' s transverse OAM, the\\nSTOV light can exert a torque on the plasma, thus providing a way to manipulate\\nthe transverse OAM orientation of the generated harmonics.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T06:08:13Z\"}"}
