This method\\nreconstructs particle number distributions using the Edgeworth expansion, with\\nparameters optimized via a combination of differential evolution algorithm and\\nBayesian inference. Its effectiveness is validated using UrQMD model\\nsimulations and benchmarked against traditional approaches, including\\ncentrality definitions based on particle multiplicity. Our results show that\\nthe proposed framework yields cumulant patterns consistent with those obtained\\nusing number of participant nucleon ($N_{\\\\text{part}}$) based centrality\\nobservables, while eliminating the conventional reliance on centrality\\ndetermination. This consistency confirms the method's ability to extract\\ngenuine physical signals, thereby paving the way for probing the intrinsic\\nthermodynamic properties of the produced medium through event-by-event\\nfluctuations.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.data-an\", \"categories\": \"physics.data-an,hep-ex,hep-th,nucl-ex,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T16:06:44Z\"}"}
