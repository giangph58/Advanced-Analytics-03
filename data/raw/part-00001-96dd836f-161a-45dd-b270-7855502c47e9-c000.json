{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20810v1\", \"title\": \"Effective Metric Description of Charged Black Holes\", \"summary\": \"Charged black holes arise as solutions of General Relativity (GR) coupled to\\nMaxwell theory. As functions of the mass and charge, they can exhibit extremal\\nbehavior, in which case they are stable against thermal decay. (Quantum)\\ncorrections to GR are expected to alter the classical features of these\\nobjects, especially near extremality. To capture such effects in a\\nmodel-independent way, we extend the Effective Metric Description (EMD)\\npreviously introduced in [Phys.Rev.D 109 (2024) 2, 024045, Eur.Phys.J.C 84\\n(2024) 12, 1273] for spherically symmetric and static black holes. The EMD\\nparametrizes deformations of the metric in terms of physical quantities, such\\nas the radial spatial distance to the event horizon. While the latter is still\\nviable for non-extremal charged black holes, we argue that the proper time of a\\nfree-falling observer is better suited in the extremal case: we derive the\\nnecessary conditions for the parameters of such an EMD for constructing a\\nconsistent space-time in the vicinity of the (extremal) horizon. Finally, we\\nillustrate our framework through a concrete example, and mention implications\\nof the Weak Gravity Conjecture on the effective metric parameters.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:23:33Z\"}"}
