Traditional root cause analysis\\n(RCA) struggles to achieve automated fault response, heavily relying on manual\\nintervention. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made\\nbreakthroughs in contextual inference and domain knowledge integration,\\nproviding new solutions for Artificial Intelligence for Operations (AIOps).\\nHowever, Existing LLM-based approaches face three key challenges: text input\\nconstraints, dynamic service dependency hallucinations, and context window\\nlimitations. To address these issues, we propose a tool-assisted LLM agent with\\nmulti-modality observation data, namely TAMO, for fine-grained RCA. It unifies\\nmulti-modal observational data into time-aligned representations to extract\\nconsistent features and employs specialized root cause localization and fault\\nclassification tools for perceiving the contextual environment. This approach\\novercomes the limitations of LLM in handling real-time changing service\\ndependencies and raw observational data and guides LLM to generate repair\\nstrategies aligned with system contexts by structuring key information into a\\nprompt. Experimental results show that TAMO performs well in root cause\\nanalysis when dealing with public datasets characterized by heterogeneity and\\ncommon fault types, demonstrating its effectiveness.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T06:50:48Z\"}"}
