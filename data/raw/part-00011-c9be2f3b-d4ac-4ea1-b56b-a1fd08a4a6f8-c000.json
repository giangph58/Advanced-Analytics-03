However, existing methods still face substantial challenges\\nin capturing fine geometric details and maintaining animation stability,\\nparticularly under dynamic or complex poses. To address these issues, we\\npropose a novel real-time framework for animatable human avatar reconstruction\\nbased on 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS). By leveraging 2DGS and global SMPL pose\\nparameters, our framework not only aligns positional and rotational\\ndiscrepancies but also enables robust and natural pose-driven animation of the\\nreconstructed avatars. Furthermore, we introduce a Rotation Compensation\\nNetwork (RCN) that learns rotation residuals by integrating local geometric\\nfeatures with global pose parameters. This network significantly improves the\\nhandling of non-rigid deformations and ensures smooth, artifact-free pose\\ntransitions during animation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method\\nsuccessfully reconstructs realistic and highly animatable human avatars from\\nmonocular videos, effectively preserving fine-grained details while ensuring\\nstable and natural pose variation. Our approach surpasses current\\nstate-of-the-art methods in both reconstruction quality and animation\\nrobustness on public benchmarks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T09:41:28Z\"}"}
