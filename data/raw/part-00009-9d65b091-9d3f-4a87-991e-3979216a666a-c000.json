One interesting\\nfeature of our varieties is that the subordinate Brauer group may be\\narbitrarily large.\\n  As an application of our methods, we answer a question of Lenstra by giving\\nan asymptotic for the triples of integers $(a, b, c)$ for which the R\\\\'edei\\nsymbol $[a, b, c]$ takes a given value. We also make significant progress on a\\nquestion of Serre on the zero loci of systems of quaternion algebras defined\\nover $\\\\mathbb{Q}(t_1, \\\\dots, t_n)$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T16:50:33Z\"}"}
