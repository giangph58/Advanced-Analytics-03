A\\ncomputational method is valuable for scaling the identification of such\\nstatements from a growing body of EU legislation, constituting approximately\\n180,000 published legal acts between 1952 and 2023. Past work on extraction of\\nthese statements varies in the permissiveness of their definitions for what\\nconstitutes a regulatory statement. In this work, we provide a specific\\ndefinition for our purposes based on the institutional grammar tool. We develop\\nand compare two contrasting approaches for automatically identifying such\\nstatements in EU legislation, one based on dependency parsing, and the other on\\na transformer-based machine learning model. We found both approaches performed\\nsimilarly well with accuracies of 80% and 84% respectively and a K alpha of\\n0.58. The high accuracies and not exceedingly high agreement suggests potential\\nfor combining strengths of both approaches.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,I.2.7\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T12:11:32Z\"}"}
