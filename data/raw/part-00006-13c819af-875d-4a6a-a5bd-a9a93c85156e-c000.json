To\\nthis end, we propose Pixel3DMM, a set of highly-generalized vision transformers\\nwhich predict per-pixel geometric cues in order to constrain the optimization\\nof a 3D morphable face model (3DMM). We exploit the latent features of the DINO\\nfoundation model, and introduce a tailored surface normal and uv-coordinate\\nprediction head. We train our model by registering three high-quality 3D face\\ndatasets against the FLAME mesh topology, which results in a total of over\\n1,000 identities and 976K images. For 3D face reconstruction, we propose a\\nFLAME fitting opitmization that solves for the 3DMM parameters from the\\nuv-coordinate and normal estimates. To evaluate our method, we introduce a new\\nbenchmark for single-image face reconstruction, which features high diversity\\nfacial expressions, viewing angles, and ethnicities. Crucially, our benchmark\\nis the first to evaluate both posed and neutral facial geometry. Ultimately,\\nour method outperforms the most competitive baselines by over 15% in terms of\\ngeometric accuracy for posed facial expressions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T15:47:03Z\"}"}
