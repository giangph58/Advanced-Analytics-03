First, we describe the\\nlocal geometries of such manifolds in terms of certain Einstein and\\nquasi-Einstein warped products. Secondly, a global classification result is\\nobtained when one of the underlying metrics is complete, showing that either it\\nis a weighted space form, a special Einstein warped product, or a specific\\nfamily of quasi-Einstein warped products. As a consequence, it must be a\\nweighted sphere in the compact case.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:36:21Z\"}"}
