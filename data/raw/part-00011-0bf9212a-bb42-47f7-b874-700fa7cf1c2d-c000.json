{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20544v1\", \"title\": \"Efficient patient-centric EMR sharing block tree\", \"summary\": \"Flexible sharing of electronic medical records (EMRs) is an urgent need in\\nhealthcare, as fragmented storage creates EMR management complexity for both\\npractitioners and patients. Blockchain has emerged as a promising solution to\\naddress the limitations of centralized EMR systems regarding interoperability,\\ndata ownership, and trust concerns. Whilst its healthcare implementation\\ncontinues to face scalability challenges, particularly in uploading lag time as\\nEMR volumes increase. In this paper, we describe the design of a novel\\nblockchain-based data structure, MedBlockTree, which aims to solve the\\nscalability issue in blockchain-based EMR systems, particularly low block\\nthroughput and patient awareness. MedBlockTree leverages a chameleon hash\\nfunction to generate collision blocks for existing patients and expand a single\\nchain into a growing block tree with $n$ branches that are capable of\\nprocessing $n$ new blocks in a single consensus round. We also introduce the\\nEnhancedPro consensus algorithm to manage multiple branches and maintain\\nnetwork consistency. Our comprehensive simulation evaluates performance across\\nfour dimensions: branch number, worker number, collision rate, and network\\nlatency. Comparative analysis against a traditional blockchain-based EMR system\\ndemonstrates outstanding throughput improvements across all dimensions,\\nachieving processing speeds $\\\\nu\\\\cdot n$ times faster than conventional\\napproaches.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC,cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T08:42:01Z\"}"}
