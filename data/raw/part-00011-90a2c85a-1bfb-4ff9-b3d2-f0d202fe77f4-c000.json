We show that these rings are precisely those\\nNoetherian rings for which every min-flat module is projective and we study\\nthis characterization in the cases when the ring is Kasch, commutative and when\\nit is quasi-Frobenius. We also treat the case of $n\\\\times n$ upper triangular\\nmatrix rings, proving that their mininjective modules are injective if and only\\nif $n=2$.\\n  We use the developed machinery to find a new type of examples of indigent\\nmodules (those whose subinjectivity domain contains only the injective\\nmodules), whose existence is known, so far, only in some rather restricted\\nsituations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RA\", \"categories\": \"math.RA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T10:32:34Z\"}"}
