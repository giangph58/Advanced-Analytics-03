{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10414v1\", \"title\": \"HUMOTO: A 4D Dataset of Mocap Human Object Interactions\", \"summary\": \"We present Human Motions with Objects (HUMOTO), a high-fidelity dataset of\\nhuman-object interactions for motion generation, computer vision, and robotics\\napplications. Featuring 736 sequences (7,875 seconds at 30 fps), HUMOTO\\ncaptures interactions with 63 precisely modeled objects and 72 articulated\\nparts. Our innovations include a scene-driven LLM scripting pipeline creating\\ncomplete, purposeful tasks with natural progression, and a mocap-and-camera\\nrecording setup to effectively handle occlusions. Spanning diverse activities\\nfrom cooking to outdoor picnics, HUMOTO preserves both physical accuracy and\\nlogical task flow. Professional artists rigorously clean and verify each\\nsequence, minimizing foot sliding and object penetrations. We also provide\\nbenchmarks compared to other datasets. HUMOTO's comprehensive full-body motion\\nand simultaneous multi-object interactions address key data-capturing\\nchallenges and provide opportunities to advance realistic human-object\\ninteraction modeling across research domains with practical applications in\\nanimation, robotics, and embodied AI systems.
