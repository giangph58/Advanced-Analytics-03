In this\\nstudy, we discuss causes for large variation in reported transport properties\\nof pure Bi$_2$O$_2$Se and present a preparation method that improves the\\nreproducibility of undoped polycrystalline samples and improves their stability\\nunder thermal cycling. Key steps of this method include calcination of the\\nBi$_2$O$_3$ precursor, purification of the synthesized material in a\\ntemperature gradient, use of a coarse particle fraction and compaction of the\\npowders in a Si3N4 die instead of a graphite die. The resulting polycrystalline\\nmaterial exhibits improved reproducibility and enhanced resistance to thermal\\ncycling. It has room temperature electrical conductivity {\\\\sigma}RT ~ 500 S.m-1\\nand Seebeck coefficient S ~ -300 $\\\\mu$V.K$^{-1}$. These properties make it\\nsuitable as a reference material for future doping studies. The presented\\nsynthesis approach may provide a more reliable platform for investigating the\\nintrinsic behavior and doping response of Bi$_2$O$_2$Se in thermoelectric\\napplications.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T16:58:05Z\"}"}
