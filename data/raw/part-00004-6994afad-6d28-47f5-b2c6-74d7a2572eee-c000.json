The\\nbalance between them is tuned using a positive regularization parameter, whose\\nautomatic choice remains an open question in general. A novel approach for\\nparameter choice is introduced, based on the use of two slightly different\\ncomputational models for the same inverse problem. Small parameter values\\nshould give two very different reconstructions due to amplification of noise.\\nLarge parameter values lead to two identical but trivial reconstructions.\\nOptimal parameter is chosen between the extremes by matching image similarity\\nof the two reconstructions with a pre-defined value. Efficacy of the new method\\nis demonstrated with image deblurring using measured data and two different\\nregularizers.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T14:19:58Z\"}"}
