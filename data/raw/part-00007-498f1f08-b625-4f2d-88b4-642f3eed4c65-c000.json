This paper presents a novel method for\\nselectively enhancing the signal at critical denoising steps, optimizing image\\ngeneration based on input semantics. Our approach addresses the shortcomings of\\nearly-stage signal modifications, demonstrating that adjustments made at later\\nstages yield superior results. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the\\neffectiveness of our method in producing semantically aligned images on\\nDiffusion and Flow Matching model, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our\\nresults highlight the importance of a judicious choice of sampling stage to\\nimprove performance and overall image alignment.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T13:10:32Z\"}"}
