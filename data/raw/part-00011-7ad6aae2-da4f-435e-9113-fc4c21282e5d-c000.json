We also introduce another singlet scalar $S_0$ with a\\nnon-zero vacuum expectation value to the SM so that the fermion dark matter can\\nobtain mass after spontaneous symmetry breaking. We have a new Higgs boson in\\nthe model and in the case of the decoupling limit, the fermion dark matter\\nproduction is only determined by $S$ and the new Higgs boson. The mass\\nhierarchy of these new particles can make a difference in the reaction rate of\\ndark matter annihilation processes, contributing to different viable parameter\\nspaces for different mass orderings. We randomly scanned the parameter space\\nwith six various cases under relic density constraint and found that when\\n$\\\\chi$ is the lightest among the dark sector, $\\\\chi$ production is generated\\nvia the so-called forbidden channels. Moreover, we consider the combined limits\\narising from Higgs invisible decay, dark matter relic density and direct\\ndetection constraints. Within the chosen parameter space, direct detection\\nresults put the most stringent constraint, and we have a more flexible value\\nfor the scalar dark matter mass when the mass of $\\\\chi$ is not smaller than the\\nnew Higgs boson mass.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T12:04:13Z\"}"}
