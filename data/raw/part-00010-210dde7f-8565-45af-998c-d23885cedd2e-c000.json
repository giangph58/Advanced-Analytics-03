Specifically, we compare our NLO predictions with\\nmeasurements from the LHCb, CMS, and ATLAS Collaborations. We find that the CS\\ncontribution itself can well describe the LHCb data in most of the experimental\\nbins, except in the regions where the fixed-order calculation is spoiled by the\\nemission of soft or hard-collinear gluons. In the CMS and ATLAS cases, however,\\nthe CS predictions greatly undershoot both the measured total and differential\\ncross sections, despite sizable $K$ factors, of 2--3, for the total cross\\nsections.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T12:10:37Z\"}"}
