The\\nTRIMEG-GKX code solves the electromagnetic gyrokinetic equation using the\\nparticle-in-cell scheme, taking into account multi-species effects and shear\\nAlfv\\\\'en physics. The mixed-variable/pullback scheme has been implemented to\\nenable electromagnetic studies. This code is parallelized using particle\\ndecomposition and domain cloning among computing nodes, replacing traditional\\ndomain decomposition techniques. The applications to study the micro- and\\nmacro-instabilities are demonstrated, including the energetic-particle-driven\\nAlfv\\\\'en eigenmode, ion temperature gradient mode, and kinetic ballooning mode.\\nGood performance is achieved in both ad hoc and experimentally reconstructed\\nequilibria, such as those of the ASDEX Upgrade (AUG), Tokamak \\\\`a configuration\\nvariable (TCV), and the Joint European Torus (JET). Future studies of edge\\nphysics using the high-order $C^1$ finite element method for triangular meshes\\nin the TRIMEG-C1 code will be built upon the same numerical methods.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:47:31Z\"}"}
