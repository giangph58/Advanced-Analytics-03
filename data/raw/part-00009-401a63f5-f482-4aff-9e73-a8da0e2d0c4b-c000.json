However,\\nexisting methods face robotic hardware dependency and control frequency\\nmismatches between teleoperation devices and robotic platforms. Our approach\\nautomatically extracts kinematic parameters from unified robot description\\nformat (URDF) files, and enables pluggable deployment across diverse robots\\nthrough uniform interfaces. The proposed interpolation algorithm bridges the\\nfrequency gap between low-rate human inputs and high-frequency robotic control\\ncommands through online continuous trajectory generation, \\\\n{while requiring no\\naccess to the closed, bottom-level control loop}. To enhance trajectory\\nsmoothness, we introduce a minimum-stretch spline that optimizes the motion\\nquality. The system further provides precision and rapid modes to accommodate\\ndifferent task requirements. Experiments across various robotic platforms\\nincluding dual-arm ones demonstrate generality and smooth operation performance\\nof our methods. The code is developed in C++ with python interface, and\\navailable at https://github.com/IRMV-Manipulation-Group/UTTG.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T12:33:19Z\"}"}
