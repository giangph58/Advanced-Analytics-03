We will\\nrefer to these algebras as representation-hereditary algebras. We show that\\nthese algebras are torsionless-finite, as defined by Ringel. These algebras do\\nnot necessarily have finite global dimension; however, when there is no\\nnon-zero morphism from an injective to a projective module, they have global\\ndimension less than or equal to two, with some additional homological\\nproperties. By utilizing the general framework provided by the study of the\\nrepresentation dimension of an algebra, we present further homological\\nconsequences. In the case where these algebras are tame quasi-tilted algebras,\\nwe prove that they belong to certain classes of tilted algebras. Although not\\nall tilted algebras are representation-hereditary, we provide sufficient\\nconditions for them to be representation-hereditary.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RT\", \"categories\": \"math.RT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:09:58Z\"}"}
