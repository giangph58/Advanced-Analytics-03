The ensemble Kalman method is first\\ntested to mitigate vortex shedding of flows around a circular cylinder by\\noptimizing the placement of small cylinders downstream. Further, the method is\\nassessed to suppress shock buffeting over the NACA 0012 airfoil by optimizing\\nthe movement of a compliant aileron. Our results for all test cases show that\\nthe ensemble-based method can effectively find optimal control strategies that\\nsignificantly reduce the vibrations of aerodynamic force, and can be a useful\\nalternative for flow control optimization, due to its merits in\\nnon-intrusiveness and ease of implementation.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:59:43Z\"}"}
