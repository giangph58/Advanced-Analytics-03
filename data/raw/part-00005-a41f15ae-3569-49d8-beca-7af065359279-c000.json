Peng and Rascoussier conjectured that all\\nminimum-turn Hamiltonian cycles of $P$ exhibit a certain regular structure. We\\nprove this conjecture in the special case when $P$ is a topological disk. The\\nproof proceeds in two phases - a \\\"downward\\\" phase where we break apart an\\nirregular Hamiltonian cycle into a collection of shorter cycles; and an\\n\\\"upward\\\" phase where we put it back together in a different way so that,\\noverall, the number of turns in it decreases.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:21:13Z\"}"}
