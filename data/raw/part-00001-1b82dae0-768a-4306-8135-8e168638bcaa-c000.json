We consider a cyclic operation mode, where the working medium\\ncouples sequentially to hot and cold reservoirs, and a continuous mode with\\nboth reservoirs coupled simultaneously. We derive an effective temperature for\\nthe finite-size reservoirs determining the entropy production for two-state\\nengines in the sequential coupling scenario, and show that finite-size\\nreservoirs can meaningfully affect the power when compared to infinite-size\\nreservoirs in both sequential and simultaneous coupling scenarios. We also\\ninvestigate a three-state engine comprising two interacting units and optimize\\nits performance in the presence of a finite reservoir. Notably, we show that\\nthe efficiency at maximum power can exceed the Curzon-Ahlborn bound with finite\\nreservoirs. Our work introduces tools to optimize the performance of nanoscale\\nengines under realistic conditions of finite reservoir heat capacity and\\nimperfect thermal isolation.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech,cond-mat.other,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T12:22:51Z\"}"}
