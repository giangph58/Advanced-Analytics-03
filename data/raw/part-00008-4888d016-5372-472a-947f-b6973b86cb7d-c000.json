{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05010v1\", \"title\": \"Improving Global Motion Estimation in Sparse IMU-based Motion Capture\\n  with Physics\", \"summary\": \"By learning human motion priors, motion capture can be achieved by 6 inertial\\nmeasurement units (IMUs) in recent years with the development of deep learning\\ntechniques, even though the sensor inputs are sparse and noisy. However, human\\nglobal motions are still challenging to be reconstructed by IMUs. This paper\\naims to solve this problem by involving physics. It proposes a physical\\noptimization scheme based on multiple contacts to enable physically plausible\\ntranslation estimation in the full 3D space where the z-directional motion is\\nusually challenging for previous works. It also considers gravity in local pose\\nestimation which well constrains human global orientations and refines local\\npose estimation in a joint estimation manner. Experiments demonstrate that our\\nmethod achieves more accurate motion capture for both local poses and global\\nmotions. Furthermore, by deeply integrating physics, we can also estimate 3D\\ncontact, contact forces, joint torques, and interacting proxy surfaces.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GR\", \"categories\": \"cs.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T07:30:22Z\"}"}
