To do\\nthat, we use the foundational correspondence between numerical sets and Young\\ndiagrams, which enables a visual and algorithmic approach to studying\\nproperties of numerical semigroups. Central to the paper, a decomposition\\ntheorem for almost symmetric numerical semigroups is proved, which reveals that\\nsuch semigroups can be uniquely expressed as a combination of a numerical\\nsemigroup, its dual and an ordinary numerical semigroup.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GR\", \"categories\": \"math.GR,math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T12:11:17Z\"}"}
