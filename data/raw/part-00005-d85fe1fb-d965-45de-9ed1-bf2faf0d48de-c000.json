{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07884v1\", \"title\": \"CatCMA with Margin: Stochastic Optimization for Continuous, Integer, and\\n  Categorical Variables\", \"summary\": \"This study focuses on mixed-variable black-box optimization (MV-BBO),\\naddressing continuous, integer, and categorical variables. Many real-world\\nMV-BBO problems involve dependencies among these different types of variables,\\nrequiring efficient methods to optimize them simultaneously. Recently,\\nstochastic optimization methods leveraging the mechanism of the covariance\\nmatrix adaptation evolution strategy have shown promising results in\\nmixed-integer or mixed-category optimization. However, such methods cannot\\nhandle the three types of variables simultaneously. In this study, we propose\\nCatCMA with Margin (CatCMAwM), a stochastic optimization method for MV-BBO that\\njointly optimizes continuous, integer, and categorical variables. CatCMAwM is\\ndeveloped by incorporating a novel integer handling into CatCMA, a\\nmixed-category black-box optimization method employing a joint distribution of\\nmultivariate Gaussian and categorical distributions. The proposed integer\\nhandling is carefully designed by reviewing existing integer handlings and\\nfollowing the design principles of CatCMA. Even when applied to mixed-integer\\nproblems, it stabilizes the marginal probability and improves the convergence\\nperformance of continuous variables. Numerical experiments show that CatCMAwM\\neffectively handles the three types of variables, outperforming\\nstate-of-the-art Bayesian optimization methods and baselines that simply\\nincorporate existing integer handlings into CatCMA.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NE\", \"categories\": \"cs.NE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:59:22Z\"}"}
