{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00340v1\", \"title\": \"Vehicular Communication Security: Multi-Channel and Multi-Factor\\n  Authentication\", \"summary\": \"Secure and reliable communications are crucial for Intelligent Transportation\\nSystems (ITSs), where Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication plays a key\\nrole in enabling mobility-enhancing and safety-critical services. Current V2I\\nauthentication relies on credential-based methods over wireless\\nNon-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) channels, leaving them exposed to remote impersonation\\nand proximity attacks. To mitigate these risks, we propose a unified\\nMulti-Channel, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) scheme that combines NLOS\\ncryptographic credentials with a Line-of-Sight (LOS) visual channel. Our\\napproach leverages a challenge-response security paradigm: the infrastructure\\nissues challenges and the vehicle's headlights respond by flashing a structured\\nsequence containing encoded security data. Deep learning models on the\\ninfrastructure side then decode the embedded information to authenticate the\\nvehicle. Real-world experimental evaluations demonstrate high test accuracy,\\nreaching an average of 95% and 96.6%, respectively, under various lighting,\\nweather, speed, and distance conditions. Additionally, we conducted extensive\\nexperiments on three state-of-the-art deep learning models, including detailed\\nablation studies for decoding the flashing sequence. Our results indicate that\\nthe optimal architecture employs a dual-channel design, enabling simultaneous\\ndecoding of the flashing sequence and extraction of vehicle spatial and\\nlocational features for robust authentication.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T06:36:24Z\"}"}
