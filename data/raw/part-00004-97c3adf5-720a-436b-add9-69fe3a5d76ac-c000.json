{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03513v1\", \"title\": \"Ruled by the Representation Space: On the University's Embrace of Large\\n  Language Models\", \"summary\": \"This paper explores the implications of universities' rapid adoption of large\\nlanguage models (LLMs) for studying, teaching, and research by analyzing the\\nlogics underpinning their representation space. It argues that by uncritically\\nadopting LLMs, the University surrenders its autonomy to a field of heteronomy,\\nthat of generative AI, whose norms are not democratically shaped. Unlike\\nearlier forms of rule-based AI, which sought to exclude human judgment and\\ninterpretation, generative AI's new normative rationality is explicitly based\\non the automation of moral judgment, valuation, and interpretation. By\\nintegrating LLMs into pedagogical and research contexts before establishing a\\ncritical framework for their use, the University subjects itself to being\\ngoverned by contingent, ever-evolving, and domain-non-specific norms that\\nstructure the model's virtual representation space and thus everything it\\ngenerates.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T13:22:37Z\"}"}
