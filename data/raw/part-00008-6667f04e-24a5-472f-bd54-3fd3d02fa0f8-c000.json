{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15736v1\", \"title\": \"Riemannian Neural Geodesic Interpolant\", \"summary\": \"Stochastic interpolants are efficient generative models that bridge two\\narbitrary probability density functions in finite time, enabling flexible\\ngeneration from the source to the target distribution or vice versa. These\\nmodels are primarily developed in Euclidean space, and are therefore limited in\\ntheir application to many distribution learning problems defined on Riemannian\\nmanifolds in real-world scenarios. In this work, we introduce the Riemannian\\nNeural Geodesic Interpolant (RNGI) model, which interpolates between two\\nprobability densities on a Riemannian manifold along the stochastic geodesics,\\nand then samples from one endpoint as the final state using the continuous flow\\noriginating from the other endpoint. We prove that the temporal marginal\\ndensity of RNGI solves a transport equation on the Riemannian manifold. After\\ntraining the model's the neural velocity and score fields, we propose the\\nEmbedding Stochastic Differential Equation (E-SDE) algorithm for stochastic\\nsampling of RNGI. E-SDE significantly improves the sampling quality by reducing\\nthe accumulated error caused by the excessive intrinsic discretization of\\nRiemannian Brownian motion in the classical Geodesic Random Walk (GRW)\\nalgorithm. We also provide theoretical bounds on the generative bias measured\\nin terms of KL-divergence. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the\\nproposed RNGI and E-SDE through experiments conducted on both collected and\\nsynthetic distributions on S2 and SO(3).\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T09:28:29Z\"}"}
