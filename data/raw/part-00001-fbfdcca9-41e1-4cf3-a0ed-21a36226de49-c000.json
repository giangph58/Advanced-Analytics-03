{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21534v1\", \"title\": \"Topological classification and edge states of magnons in honeycomb\\n  ferromagnets\", \"summary\": \"We study the topological classification and related edge states of magnons in\\nferromagnets on honeycomb that can be described by a class of single-particle\\nbosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) models. Both single layer and bilayer\\nsituations are considered. The calculations show that the existence and related\\ntopologies of these edge states are well captured by a class of non-Hermitian\\nsingle or coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains models H(ky) parameterized by\\nmomentum ky, where the edge states can appear as the ground state for some\\ncases. Interestingly, although the eigenproblem of bosonic BdG models is\\nequivalent to the one of non-Hermitian systems, the conventional bulkedge\\ncorrespondence for Hermitian systems is partially valid. The influence of\\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions between next nearest-neighbor spins are also\\ndiscussed, which break the time-reversal symmetry and lead to a straight\\nconnection between edge states for magnonic systems and non-zero Chern number\\nof non-Hermitian bulk two-dimensional systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T11:29:38Z\"}"}
