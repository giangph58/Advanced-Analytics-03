Recently, OTFS and its variants have garnered significant\\nattention for their performance in severe conditions (like high delay and\\nDoppler), making it a promising candidate for future communications. In this\\nwork, we implement Zak-OTFS for the over-the-air experiments with traditional\\npoint pilots and the new spread pilots. Notably, we design our spread-pilot\\nwaveforms with communications and sensing coexisting in the same radio\\nresources. We define the system model and the signal design for integration\\nonto our state-of-the-art sub-THz wireless testbed. We show successful data\\ntransmission over-the-air at 140 GHz and 240 GHz in a variety of\\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. In addition, we demonstrate integrated\\nsensing and communications (ISAC) capabilities and show PAPR improvement of\\nover 5 dB with spread pilots compared to point pilots.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP,cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T14:46:11Z\"}"}
