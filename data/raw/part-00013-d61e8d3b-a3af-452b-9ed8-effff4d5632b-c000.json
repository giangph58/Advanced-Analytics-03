{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01571v1\", \"title\": \"Pro-DG: Procedural Diffusion Guidance for Architectural Facade\\n  Generation\", \"summary\": \"We present Pro-DG, a framework for procedurally controllable photo-realistic\\nfacade generation that combines a procedural shape grammar with diffusion-based\\nimage synthesis. Starting from a single input image, we reconstruct its facade\\nlayout using grammar rules, then edit that structure through user-defined\\ntransformations. As facades are inherently multi-hierarchical structures, we\\nintroduce hierarchical matching procedure that aligns facade structures at\\ndifferent levels which is used to introduce control maps to guide a generative\\ndiffusion pipeline. This approach retains local appearance fidelity while\\naccommodating large-scale edits such as floor duplication or window\\nrearrangement. We provide a thorough evaluation, comparing Pro-DG against\\ninpainting-based baselines and synthetic ground truths. Our user study and\\nquantitative measurements indicate improved preservation of architectural\\nidentity and higher edit accuracy. Our novel method is the first to integrate\\nneuro-symbolically derived shape-grammars for modeling with modern generative\\nmodel and highlights the broader potential of such approaches for precise and\\ncontrollable image manipulation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GR\", \"categories\": \"cs.GR,cs.AI,cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T10:16:19Z\"}"}
