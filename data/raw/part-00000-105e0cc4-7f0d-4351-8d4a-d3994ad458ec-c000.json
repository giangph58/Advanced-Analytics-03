{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05469v1\", \"title\": \"Generating Physically Stable and Buildable LEGO Designs from Text\", \"summary\": \"We introduce LegoGPT, the first approach for generating physically stable\\nLEGO brick models from text prompts. To achieve this, we construct a\\nlarge-scale, physically stable dataset of LEGO designs, along with their\\nassociated captions, and train an autoregressive large language model to\\npredict the next brick to add via next-token prediction. To improve the\\nstability of the resulting designs, we employ an efficient validity check and\\nphysics-aware rollback during autoregressive inference, which prunes infeasible\\ntoken predictions using physics laws and assembly constraints. Our experiments\\nshow that LegoGPT produces stable, diverse, and aesthetically pleasing LEGO\\ndesigns that align closely with the input text prompts. We also develop a\\ntext-based LEGO texturing method to generate colored and textured designs. We\\nshow that our designs can be assembled manually by humans and automatically by\\nrobotic arms. We also release our new dataset, StableText2Lego, containing over\\n47,000 LEGO structures of over 28,000 unique 3D objects accompanied by detailed\\ncaptions, along with our code and models at the project website:\\nhttps://avalovelace1.github.io/LegoGPT/.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T17:58:18Z\"}"}
