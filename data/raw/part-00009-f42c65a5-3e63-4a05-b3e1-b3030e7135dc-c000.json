{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03431v1\", \"title\": \"A Fusion-Guided Inception Network for Hyperspectral Image\\n  Super-Resolution\", \"summary\": \"The fusion of low-spatial-resolution hyperspectral images (HSIs) with\\nhigh-spatial-resolution conventional images (e.g., panchromatic or RGB) has\\nplayed a significant role in recent advancements in HSI super-resolution.\\nHowever, this fusion process relies on the availability of precise alignment\\nbetween image pairs, which is often challenging in real-world scenarios. To\\nmitigate this limitation, we propose a single-image super-resolution model\\ncalled the Fusion-Guided Inception Network (FGIN). Specifically, we first\\nemploy a spectral-spatial fusion module to effectively integrate spectral and\\nspatial information at an early stage. Next, an Inception-like hierarchical\\nfeature extraction strategy is used to capture multiscale spatial dependencies,\\nfollowed by a dedicated multi-scale fusion block. To further enhance\\nreconstruction quality, we incorporate an optimized upsampling module that\\ncombines bilinear interpolation with depthwise separable convolutions.\\nExperimental evaluations on two publicly available hyperspectral datasets\\ndemonstrate the competitive performance of our method.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T11:15:59Z\"}"}
