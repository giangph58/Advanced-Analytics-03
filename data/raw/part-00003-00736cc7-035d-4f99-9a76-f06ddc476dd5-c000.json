First, we extract long-time\\nconvergence from the decay of a potential energy functional{--despite its\\nnon-coercive nature--thereby revealing a variational structure underlying the\\ndynamics.} Second, we derive refined commutator estimates to control the\\nevolution of higher Sobolev norms throughout the full range of $k>2$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T11:59:32Z\"}"}
