Up to\\nnow, this is done manually by experts or by using optimization approaches with\\na high computational effort. We propose a novel AI-based approach to generate\\ndispense paths for TIM and similar dispensing applications. It is a drop-in\\nreplacement for optimization-based approaches. An Artificial Neural Network\\n(ANN) receives the target cooling area as input and directly outputs the\\ndispense path. Our proposed setup does not require labels and we show its\\nfeasibility on multiple target areas. The resulting dispense paths can be\\ndirectly transferred to automated manufacturing equipment and do not exhibit\\nair entrapments. The approach of using an ANN to predict process parameters for\\na desired target state in real-time could potentially be transferred to other\\nmanufacturing processes.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T14:13:20Z\"}"}
