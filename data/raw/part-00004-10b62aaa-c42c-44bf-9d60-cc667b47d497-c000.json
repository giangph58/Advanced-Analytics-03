HR-TLM has the similar infrastructure with Refined TLM\\n(RTLM) or Refined-Ladder TLM(R-LTLM), but is optimized for calibration methods.\\nIts advantage lies in maintaining low \\\\r{ho}_c extraction accuracy while\\nsignificantly reducing the impact of structural process errors. According to\\nthe error analysis model, we verify that the extraction accuracy of HR-TLM\\nbased on R-LTLM can reach 10-9 {\\\\Omega}cm2 at micron scale lithography\\nprecision.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T05:29:47Z\"}"}
