In this paper, we present a novel relational heap\\nencoding leveraging uninterpreted predicates and prophecy variables, reducing\\nheap verification tasks to satisfiability checks over integers in constrained\\nHorn clauses (CHCs). To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first\\ninvariant-based method that achieves both soundness and completeness for\\nheap-manipulating programs. We provide formal proofs establishing the\\ncorrectness of our encodings. Through an experimental evaluation we demonstrate\\nthat our method significantly extends the capability of existing CHC-based\\nverification tools, allowing automatic verification of programs with heap\\npreviously unreachable by state-of-the-art tools.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LO\", \"categories\": \"cs.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T12:40:21Z\"}"}
