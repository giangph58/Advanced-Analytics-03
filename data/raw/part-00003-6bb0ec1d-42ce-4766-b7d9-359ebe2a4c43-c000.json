{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04511v1\", \"title\": \"Quantifying Suppression of Solar Surface Magnetic Flux Advection with\\n  Increasing Field Strength\", \"summary\": \"One of the main theories for heating of the solar corona is based on the idea\\nthat solar convection shuffles and tangles magnetic field lines to make many\\nsmall-scale current sheets that, via reconnection, heat coronal loops. Tiwari\\net al 2017 present evidence that, besides depending on loop length and other\\nfactors, the brightness of a coronal loop depends on the field strength in the\\nloop feet and the freedom of convection in the feet. While it is known that\\nstrong solar magnetic fields suppress convection, the decrease in the speed of\\nhorizontal advection of magnetic flux with increasing field strength has not\\nbeen quantified before. We quantify that trend by analyzing 24hours of HMI\\nSHARP vector magnetograms of each of six sunspot active regions and their\\nsurroundings. Using Fourier Local Correlation Tracking, we estimate the\\nhorizontal advection speed of the magnetic flux at each pixel in which the\\nvertical component of the magnetic field strength (Bz) is well above (greater\\nthan or equal to 150 G) noise level. We find that the average horizontal\\nadvection speed of magnetic flux steadily decreases as Bz increases, from 110\\npm 3 meters per sec for 150 G (in network and plage) to 10 pm 4 meters per sec\\nfor 2500 G (in sunspot umbra). The trend is well fit by a fourth degree\\npolynomial. These results quantitatively confirm the expectation that magnetic\\nflux advection is suppressed by increasing magnetic field strength. The\\npresented quantitative relation should be useful for future MHD simulations of\\ncoronal heating.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T15:33:16Z\"}"}
