FLUKE introduces\\ncontrolled variations across linguistic levels - from orthography to dialect\\nand style varieties - and leverages large language models (LLMs) with human\\nvalidation to generate modifications. We demonstrate FLUKE's utility by\\nevaluating both fine-tuned models and LLMs across four diverse NLP tasks, and\\nreveal that (1) the impact of linguistic variations is highly task-dependent,\\nwith some tests being critical for certain tasks but irrelevant for others; (2)\\nwhile LLMs have better overall robustness compared to fine-tuned models, they\\nstill exhibit significant brittleness to certain linguistic variations; (3) all\\nmodels show substantial vulnerability to negation modifications across most\\ntasks. These findings highlight the importance of systematic robustness testing\\nfor understanding model behaviors.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T07:12:37Z\"}"}
