We introduce Ai2 Scholar QA, a free online\\nscientific question answering application. To facilitate research, we make our\\nentire pipeline public: as a customizable open-source Python package and\\ninteractive web app, along with paper indexes accessible through public APIs\\nand downloadable datasets. We describe our system in detail and present\\nexperiments analyzing its key design decisions. In an evaluation on a recent\\nscientific QA benchmark, we find that Ai2 Scholar QA outperforms competing\\nsystems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T04:48:18Z\"}"}
