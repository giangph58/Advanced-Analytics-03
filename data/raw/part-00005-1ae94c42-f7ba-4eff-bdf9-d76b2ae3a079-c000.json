Here, we argue that such\\ngyroscopically stabilized spin rotors offer a promising platform for probing\\nand exploiting quantum spin-rotation coupling of particles hosting a single\\nspin degree of freedom. Specifically, we derive the effective Hamiltonian\\ndescribing how an embedded spin affects the rotation of rapidly revolving\\nquantum rotors due to the Einstein-de Haas and Barnett effects, which we use to\\ndevise experimental protocols for observing this coupling in state-of-the-art\\nexperiments. This will open the door for future exploitations of quantum spin\\nrotors for superposition experiments with massive objects.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T15:47:58Z\"}"}
