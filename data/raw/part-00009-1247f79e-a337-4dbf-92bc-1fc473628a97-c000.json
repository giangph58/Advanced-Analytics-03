In this work, we present a\\ngeneralized Hubbard model containing a variety of pseudo-spin terms that break\\nthe SO$_{4}$ symmetry but retain the $\\\\eta $-pairing symmetry. This allows us\\nto construct a variety of correlated systems possessing $\\\\eta $% -pairing\\neigenstates.\\\\ We exemplify our findings by considering a modified Hubbard model\\nassociated with alternative magnetic fields and on-site repulsion. We find that\\nthe same quasi-$\\\\eta $-pairing eigenstate exhibits two distinct dynamic\\nbehaviors in the two models. Numerical results of the time evolution driven by\\nseveral typical Hamiltonians accord with the analytic predictions and provide a\\nway of the control of an $\\\\eta $-pairing wavepacket with the aid of a\\ntime-dependent Hamiltonian.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T13:29:53Z\"}"}
