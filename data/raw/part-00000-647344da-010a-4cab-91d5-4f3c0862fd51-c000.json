{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20720v1\", \"title\": \"Learning a General Model: Folding Clothing with Topological Dynamics\", \"summary\": \"The high degrees of freedom and complex structure of garments present\\nsignificant challenges for clothing manipulation. In this paper, we propose a\\ngeneral topological dynamics model to fold complex clothing. By utilizing the\\nvisible folding structure as the topological skeleton, we design a novel\\ntopological graph to represent the clothing state. This topological graph is\\nlow-dimensional and applied for complex clothing in various folding states. It\\nindicates the constraints of clothing and enables predictions regarding\\nclothing movement. To extract graphs from self-occlusion, we apply semantic\\nsegmentation to analyze the occlusion relationships and decompose the clothing\\nstructure. The decomposed structure is then combined with keypoint detection to\\ngenerate the topological graph. To analyze the behavior of the topological\\ngraph, we employ an improved Graph Neural Network (GNN) to learn the general\\ndynamics. The GNN model can predict the deformation of clothing and is employed\\nto calculate the deformation Jacobi matrix for control. Experiments using\\njackets validate the algorithm's effectiveness to recognize and fold complex\\nclothing with self-occlusion.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:00:32Z\"}"}
