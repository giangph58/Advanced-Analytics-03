{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00472v1\", \"title\": \"UserCentrix: An Agentic Memory-augmented AI Framework for Smart Spaces\", \"summary\": \"Agentic AI, with its autonomous and proactive decision-making, has\\ntransformed smart environments. By integrating Generative AI (GenAI) and\\nmulti-agent systems, modern AI frameworks can dynamically adapt to user\\npreferences, optimize data management, and improve resource allocation. This\\npaper introduces UserCentrix, an agentic memory-augmented AI framework designed\\nto enhance smart spaces through dynamic, context-aware decision-making. This\\nframework integrates personalized Large Language Model (LLM) agents that\\nleverage user preferences and LLM memory management to deliver proactive and\\nadaptive assistance. Furthermore, it incorporates a hybrid hierarchical control\\nsystem, balancing centralized and distributed processing to optimize real-time\\nresponsiveness while maintaining global situational awareness. UserCentrix\\nachieves resource-efficient AI interactions by embedding memory-augmented\\nreasoning, cooperative agent negotiation, and adaptive orchestration\\nstrategies. Our key contributions include (i) a self-organizing framework with\\nproactive scaling based on task urgency, (ii) a Value of Information\\n(VoI)-driven decision-making process, (iii) a meta-reasoning personal LLM\\nagent, and (iv) an intelligent multi-agent coordination system for seamless\\nenvironment adaptation. Experimental results across various models confirm the\\neffectiveness of our approach in enhancing response accuracy, system\\nefficiency, and computational resource management in real-world application.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.DC,cs.MA,cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T11:54:49Z\"}"}
