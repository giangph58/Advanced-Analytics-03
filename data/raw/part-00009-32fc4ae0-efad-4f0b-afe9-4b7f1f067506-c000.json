{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19505v1\", \"title\": \"Exploring Ultralight Dark Matter Self-Coupling via the Gravitational\\n  Wave Background\", \"summary\": \"Supermassive black hole binary mergers serve as prominent sources of the\\nstochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), detectable by pulsar timing\\narrays (PTAs). If dark matter-induced friction is present in the vicinity of\\nthese mergers, it can lead to suppression in the nanohertz frequency range of\\nthe SGWB spectrum. In particular, ultralight dark matter (ULDM) forming compact\\nsolitonic cores around supermassive black holes can imprint signatures in PTA\\nobservations. Our analysis places limits on the mass and self-interaction\\nstrength of ULDM, demonstrating that soliton-induced dynamical friction can\\nsignificantly alter the SGWB spectrum. PTAs have the potential to exclude\\ncertain ULDM mass ranges while probing the effects of self-interactions,\\noffering a novel avenue to investigate the fundamental properties of ULDM.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,astro-ph.GA,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T05:59:41Z\"}"}
