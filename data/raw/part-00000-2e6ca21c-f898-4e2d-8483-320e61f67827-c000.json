{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10083v1\", \"title\": \"Axion-like Dark Matter Search with Space-based Gravitational Wave\\n  Detectors\", \"summary\": \"We propose a novel modification to the optical benches of space-based\\ngravitational wave detectors (SGWDs) to enable the detection of axion-like dark\\nmatter (ALDM)-induced birefringence without altering the polarization of\\ninter-spacecraft laser links. Our design introduces an auxiliary interferometer\\nto convert polarization modulation into measurable phase shifts. Analytical\\nexpressions for sensitivity to the ALDM-photon coupling are derived for various\\ntime-delay interferometry (TDI) combinations. Projected sensitivity curves\\ndemonstrate complementary coverage across the ALDM mass range\\n$10^{-19}\\\\sim10^{-14}\\\\mathrm{eV}$. This approach preserves the original\\ninterferometric stability while enabling new physics capabilities for SGWDs.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,astro-ph.CO,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T10:38:59Z\"}"}
