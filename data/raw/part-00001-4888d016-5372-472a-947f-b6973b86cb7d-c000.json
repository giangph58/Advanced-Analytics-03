{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05003v1\", \"title\": \"Experiment Study on Reference-Path-Aided System Calibration for mmWave\\n  Bistatic ISAC Systems\", \"summary\": \"Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) has been regarded as a key\\nenabling technology for next-generation wireless networks. Compared to\\nmonostatic ISAC, bistatic ISAC can eliminate the critical challenge of\\nself-interference cancellation and is well compatible with the existing network\\ninfrastructures. However, the synchronization between the transmitter and the\\nsensing receiver becomes a crucial problem. The extracted channel state\\ninformation (CSI) for sensing under communication synchronization contains\\ndifferent types of system errors, such as the sampling time offset (STO),\\ncarrier frequency offset (CFO), and random phase shift, which can severely\\ndegrade sensing performance or even render sensing infeasible. To address this\\nproblem, a reference-path-aided system calibration scheme is designed for\\nmmWave bistatic ISAC systems, where the line-of-sight (LoS) path can be\\nblocked. By exploiting the delay-angle sparsity feature in mmWave ISAC systems,\\nthe reference path, which can be either a LoS or a non-LoS (NLoS) path, is\\nfirst identified. By leveraging the fact that all the paths suffer the same\\nsystem errors, the channel parameter extracted from the reference path is\\nutilized to compensate for the system errors in all other paths. A mmWave ISAC\\nsystem is developed to validate our design. Experimental results demonstrate\\nthat the proposed scheme can support precise estimation of Doppler shift and\\ndelay, maintaining time-synchronization errors within 1 nanosecond.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T07:19:08Z\"}"}
