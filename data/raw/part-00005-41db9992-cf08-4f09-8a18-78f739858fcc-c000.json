However, we show that their computational\\nperformance typically deteriorates exponentially with data size. To address\\nthis, we propose a simple divide-and-conquer Bernoulli factory MCMC algorithm\\nand prove that it has polynomial complexity of degree between 1 and 2, with the\\nexact degree depending on the existence of efficient unbiased estimators of the\\nintractable likelihood ratio. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach\\nwith applications to Bayesian inference in two intractable likelihood models,\\nand observe respective polynomial cost of degree 1.2 and 1 in the data size.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.CO\", \"categories\": \"stat.CO,62-08,G.3\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T17:27:44Z\"}"}
