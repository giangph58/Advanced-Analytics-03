We calculate the exchange and\\nanisotropy constants in our spin model by first principles. We can accurately\\nexplain the transition from a collinear to a canted ground state for a magnetic\\nfield applied normal to the (in-plane) easy-axis, and a spin-flop transition\\nwhen the field is parallel to it. A topologically protected Dirac nodal line is\\npresent and robust with respect to both external and anisotropy fields.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T08:34:24Z\"}"}
