However, like\\nmost applications of quantum computing, QRAMs suffer from qubit error and\\ndecoherence. Quantum Error Correction (QEC) provides a potential solution, but\\nunfortunately, most QEC proposals that uniformly correct all qubits of the QRAM\\nincur major overheads, making the QRAM infeasible. In this work, we propose a\\nsurface code error-corrected QRAM made of heterogeneous code distance logical\\nqubits. Our QRAM can produce higher fidelity queries, while keeping qubit\\noverheads smaller than the uniformly error-corrected QRAMs. Comparisons between\\nour novel QRAM architectures and a uniformly error corrected baseline are\\npresented, showing that our designs can achieve up to polylogarithmic reduction\\nin query infidelity, producing constant query infidelity scaling, while\\nsimultaneously reducing qubit overhead.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:23:42Z\"}"}
