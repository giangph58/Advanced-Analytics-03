They have been widely\\ndiscussed, but in isolation, leading to fragmented modeling of their dynamics.\\nThis poses a problem for connecting and building on what we know about their\\nshared mechanisms. Here we collectively propose a conceptual and mathematical\\nframework to transcend field boundaries and to explore unifying theoretical\\nframeworks and open challenges. We ring an optimistic note for weaving together\\ndisparate threads with key ideas from the wide and largely disconnected\\nliterature by focusing on the duality of innovation and obsolescence and by\\nproposing a mathematical framework to unify the metaphors between constitutive\\nelements.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T12:32:36Z\"}"}
