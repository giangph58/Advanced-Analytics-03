{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04245v1\", \"title\": \"Self-Calibrating Position Measurements: Applied to Imperfect Hall\\n  Sensors\", \"summary\": \"Linear Hall sensors are a cost-effective alternative to optical encoders for\\nmeasuring the rotor positions of actuators, with the main challenge being that\\nthey exhibit position-dependent inaccuracies resulting from manufacturing\\ntolerances. This paper develops a data-driven calibration procedure for linear\\nanalog Hall sensors that enables accurate online estimates of the rotor angle\\nwithout requiring expensive external encoders. The approach combines\\nclosed-loop data collection with nonlinear identification to obtain an accurate\\nmodel of the sensor inaccuracies, which is subsequently used for online\\ncompensation. Simulation results show that when the flux density model\\nstructure is known, measurement errors are reduced to the sensor noise floor,\\nand experiments on an industrial setup demonstrate a factor of 2.6 reduction in\\nthe root-mean-square measurement error. These results confirm that Hall sensor\\ninaccuracies can be calibrated even when no external encoder is available,\\nimproving their practical applicability.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:49:37Z\"}"}
