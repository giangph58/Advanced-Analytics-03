{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02245v1\", \"title\": \"Traffic Flow Data Completion and Anomaly Diagnosis via Sparse and\\n  Low-Rank Tensor Optimization\", \"summary\": \"Spatiotemporal traffic time series, such as traffic speed data, collected\\nfrom sensing systems are often incomplete, with considerable corruption and\\nlarge amounts of missing values. A vast amount of data conceals implicit data\\nstructures, which poses significant challenges for data recovery issues, such\\nas mining the potential spatio-temporal correlations of data and identifying\\nabnormal data. In this paper, we propose a Tucker decomposition-based sparse\\nlow-rank high-order tensor optimization model (TSLTO) for data imputation and\\nanomaly diagnosis. We decompose the traffic tensor data into low-rank and\\nsparse tensors, and establish a sparse low-rank high-order tensor optimization\\nmodel based on Tucker decomposition. By utilizing tools of non-smooth analysis\\nfor tensor functions, we explore the optimality conditions of the proposed\\ntensor optimization model and design an ADMM optimization algorithm for solving\\nthe model. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted on both synthetic data\\nand a real-world dataset: the urban traffic speed dataset of Guangzhou.\\nNumerical comparisons with several representative existing algorithms\\ndemonstrate that our proposed approach achieves higher accuracy and efficiency\\nin traffic flow data recovery and anomaly diagnosis tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.NA,math.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T03:21:30Z\"}"}
