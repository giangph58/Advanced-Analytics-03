This paper develops an impulsive nonlocal faecal-oral\\nmodel with free boundaries, where pulses are introduced to capture a periodic\\nspraying of disinfectant, and nonlocal diffusion describes the long-range\\ndispersal of individuals, and free boundaries represent moving infected fronts.\\nWe first check that the model has a unique nonnegative global classical\\nsolution. Then, the principal eigenvalue, which depends on the infected region,\\nthe impulse intensity, and the kernel functions for nonlocal diffusion, is\\nexamined by using the theory of resolvent positive operators and their\\nperturbations. Based on this value, this paper obtains that the diseases are\\neither vanishing or spreading, and provides criteria for determining when\\nvanishing and spreading occur. At the end, a numerical example is presented in\\norder to corroborate the theoretical findings and to gain further understanding\\nof the effect of the pulse intervention. This work shows that the pulsed\\nintervention is beneficial in combating the diseases, but the effect of the\\nnonlocal diffusion depends on the choice of the kernel functions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T09:46:39Z\"}"}
