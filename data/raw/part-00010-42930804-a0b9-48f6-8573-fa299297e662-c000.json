{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04272v1\", \"title\": \"Joint Task Offloading and Channel Allocation in Spatial-Temporal Dynamic\\n  for MEC Networks\", \"summary\": \"Computation offloading and resource allocation are critical in mobile edge\\ncomputing (MEC) systems to handle the massive and complex requirements of\\napplications restricted by limited resources. In a multi-user multi-server MEC\\nnetwork, the mobility of terminals causes computing requests to be dynamically\\ndistributed in space. At the same time, the non-negligible dependencies among\\ntasks in some specific applications impose temporal correlation constraints on\\nthe solution as well, leading the time-adjacent tasks to experience varying\\nresource availability and competition from parallel counterparts. To address\\nsuch dynamic spatial-temporal characteristics as a challenge in the allocation\\nof communication and computation resources, we formulate a long-term\\ndelay-energy trade-off cost minimization problem in the view of jointly\\noptimizing task offloading and resource allocation. We begin by designing a\\npriority evaluation scheme to decouple task dependencies and then develop a\\ngrouped Knapsack problem for channel allocation considering the current data\\nload and channel status. Afterward, in order to meet the rapid response needs\\nof MEC systems, we exploit the double duel deep Q network (D3QN) to make\\noffloading decisions and integrate channel allocation results into the reward\\nas part of the dynamic environment feedback in D3QN, constituting the joint\\noptimization of task offloading and channel allocation. Finally, comprehensive\\nsimulations demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm in the\\ndelay-energy trade-off cost and its adaptability for various applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T09:21:54Z\"}"}
