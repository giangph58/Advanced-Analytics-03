By modifying the\\nmedium's dielectric permittivity with momentum anisotropy and finite\\ncollisional rates, we derive both the real and imaginary components of the\\npotential. While collisions have minimal impact on the real part and binding\\nenergy, they significantly amplify the imaginary part, modulating the effects\\nof anisotropy. This enhancement increases quarkonium dissociation rates in a\\nnonequilibrium QGP, offering deeper insights into suppression mechanisms.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T17:47:27Z\"}"}
