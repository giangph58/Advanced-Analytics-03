They can be observed indirectly through\\nredshift-space distortions and the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. Whether it\\nis Gaussian or non-Gaussian, pairwise velocity has a broad distribution, but\\nthe cosmologically useful information lies primarily in the mean - the\\nstreaming velocities; the dispersion around the mean is often treated as a\\nnuisance and marginalized over. This conventional approach reduces the\\nconstraining power of our observations. Here, we show that this does not have\\nto be the case, provided the physics behind the dispersion is understood. We\\ndemonstrate that by splitting the halo/galaxy samples according to their\\ndensity environments and measuring the streaming velocities separately, the\\ntotal signal-to-noise is several times greater than in conventional global\\nmeasurements of the pairwise velocity distribution (PVD). This improvement\\narises because the global PVD is a composite of a series of near-Gaussian\\ndistributions with different means and dispersions, each determined by its\\nlocal density environment. Around underdense and overdense regions, the mean\\nstreaming velocities are positive and negative, respectively. By splitting the\\ndata, we avoid cancellation between these opposing velocities, effectively\\nturning what would be considered dispersion in the global PVD into a signal.\\nOur findings indicate substantial potential for improving the analysis of PVD\\nobservations using the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect and redshift-space\\ndistortions.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T15:37:28Z\"}"}
