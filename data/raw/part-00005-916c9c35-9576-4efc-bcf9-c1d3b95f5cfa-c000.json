This work\\nintroduces an open-source implementation of the Physics-Informed Neural Network\\nwith Control (PINC) framework, designed to model the dynamics of an underwater\\nvehicle. Using initial states, control actions, and time inputs, PINC extends\\nPINNs to enable physically consistent transitions beyond the training domain.\\nVarious PINC configurations are tested, including differing loss functions,\\ngradient-weighting schemes, and hyperparameters. Validation on a simulated\\nunderwater vehicle demonstrates more accurate long-horizon predictions compared\\nto a non-physics-informed baseline\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:38:57Z\"}"}
