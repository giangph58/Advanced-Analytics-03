However,\\nrealizing the required all-to-all connectivity can be challenging in practice.\\nIn this work, we use dynamic circuits, i.e., mid-circuit measurements and\\nfeed-forward operations, to implement the AQFT in logarithmic depth using only\\n$4n$ qubits arranged on a line with nearest-neighbor connectivity. Furthermore,\\nfor states with a specific structure, the number of qubits can be further\\nreduced to $2n$ while keeping the logarithmic depth and line connectivity. As\\npart of our construction, we introduce a new implementation of an adder with\\nlogarithmic depth on a line, which allows us to improve the AQFT construction\\nof Hales.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:56:41Z\"}"}
