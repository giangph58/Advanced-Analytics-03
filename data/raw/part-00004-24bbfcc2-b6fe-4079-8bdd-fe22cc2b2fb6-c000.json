This principle\\noutlines a limitation on the relationship between two infinite sequences that\\nunderpin these concepts. It is applicable to both deterministic and stochastic\\ndynamics, marking a significant step toward integrating these two fields. Our\\ninitial progress in this area was achieved through research on Markov chains\\nutilizing alpha labeling.\\n  Additionally, we offer suggestions on how this principle can assess the\\ndegree of chaos in specific processes. We also outline open questions regarding\\nthe relationships among various types of chaos, including a modification of the\\nrecurrence theorem.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.CD\", \"categories\": \"nlin.CD\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T06:19:25Z\"}"}
