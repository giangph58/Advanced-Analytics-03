We\\nobserve a clear transition from classical to quantum nature of light that\\nagrees with our Monte Carlo model. We reach unprecedented yoctojoule-level\\nsensitivity and a dynamic range exceeding 90 decibels. We utilize this\\ncapability to measure time-dependent intrapulse light coherence - a regime\\ninaccessible to conventional, time-averaged spectroscopy. This opens new\\navenues for quantum information, cryptography, and quantum light-matter\\ninteractions on sub-cycle time scales with attosecond precision.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:38:46Z\"}"}
