This model unifies existing circuit models,\\nsuch as $\\\\textsf{QAC}^0_f$ and models with adaptive intermediate measurements.\\nDespite its generality, we are able to prove nontrivial lower bounds.\\n  We prove new lower bounds in the first level of the hierarchy, showing that\\ncertain explicit quantum states cannot be approximately prepared by circuits\\nconsisting of a Clifford circuit followed by $\\\\textsf{QNC}^0$. These states\\ninclude ground states of some topologically ordered Hamiltonians and\\nnonstabilizer quantum codes. Our techniques exploit the rigid structure of\\nstabilizer codes and introduce an infectiousness property: if even a single\\nstate in a high distance code can be approximately prepared by one of these\\ncircuits, then the entire subspace must lie close to a perturbed stabilizer\\ncode. We also show that proving state preparation lower bounds beyond a certain\\nlevel of the hierarchy would imply classical circuit lower bounds beyond the\\nreach of current techniques in complexity theory.\\n  More broadly, our techniques go beyond lightcone-based methods and highlight\\nhow the magic hierarchy provides a natural framework for connecting circuit\\ncomplexity, condensed matter, and Hamiltonian complexity.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.CC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:38:20Z\"}"}
