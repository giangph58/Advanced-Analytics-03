This approach, called SSL-GAN has attracted many\\nresearchers in the last decade. Evolutionary algorithms have been used to guide\\nthe evolution and training of SSL-GANs with great success. In particular,\\nseveral co-evolutionary approaches have been applied where the two networks of\\na GAN (the generator and the discriminator) are evolved in separate\\npopulations. The co-evolutionary approaches published to date assume some\\nspatial structure of the populations, based on the ideas of cellular\\nevolutionary algorithms. They also create one single individual per generation\\nand follow a generational replacement strategy in the evolution. In this paper,\\nwe re-consider those algorithmic design decisions and propose a new\\nco-evolutionary approach, called Co-evolutionary Elitist SSL-GAN (CE-SSLGAN),\\nwith panmictic population, elitist replacement, and more than one individual in\\nthe offspring. We evaluate the performance of our proposed method using three\\nstandard benchmark datasets. The results show that creating more than one\\noffspring per population and using elitism improves the results in comparison\\nwith a classical SSL-GAN.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NE\", \"categories\": \"cs.NE,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T09:04:22Z\"}"}
