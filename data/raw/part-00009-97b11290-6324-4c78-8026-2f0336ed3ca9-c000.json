{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17699v1\", \"title\": \"Quadratic Interest Network for Multimodal Click-Through Rate Prediction\", \"summary\": \"Multimodal click-through rate (CTR) prediction is a key technique in\\nindustrial recommender systems. It leverages heterogeneous modalities such as\\ntext, images, and behavioral logs to capture high-order feature interactions\\nbetween users and items, thereby enhancing the system's understanding of user\\ninterests and its ability to predict click behavior. The primary challenge in\\nthis field lies in effectively utilizing the rich semantic information from\\nmultiple modalities while satisfying the low-latency requirements of online\\ninference in real-world applications. To foster progress in this area, the\\nMultimodal CTR Prediction Challenge Track of the WWW 2025 EReL@MIR Workshop\\nformulates the problem into two tasks: (1) Task 1 of Multimodal Item Embedding:\\nthis task aims to explore multimodal information extraction and item\\nrepresentation learning methods that enhance recommendation tasks; and (2) Task\\n2 of Multimodal CTR Prediction: this task aims to explore what multimodal\\nrecommendation model can effectively leverage multimodal embedding features and\\nachieve better performance. In this paper, we propose a novel model for Task 2,\\nnamed Quadratic Interest Network (QIN) for Multimodal CTR Prediction.\\nSpecifically, QIN employs adaptive sparse target attention to extract\\nmultimodal user behavior features, and leverages Quadratic Neural Networks to\\ncapture high-order feature interactions. As a result, QIN achieved an AUC of\\n0.9798 on the leaderboard and ranked second in the competition. The model code,\\ntraining logs, hyperparameter configurations, and checkpoints are available at\\nhttps://github.com/salmon1802/QIN.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T16:08:52Z\"}"}
