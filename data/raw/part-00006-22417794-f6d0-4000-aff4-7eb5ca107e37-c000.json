{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12682v1\", \"title\": \"WebLists: Extracting Structured Information From Complex Interactive\\n  Websites Using Executable LLM Agents\", \"summary\": \"Most recent web agent research has focused on navigation and transaction\\ntasks, with little emphasis on extracting structured data at scale. We present\\nWebLists, a benchmark of 200 data-extraction tasks across four common business\\nand enterprise use-cases. Each task requires an agent to navigate to a webpage,\\nconfigure it appropriately, and extract complete datasets with well-defined\\nschemas. We show that both LLMs with search capabilities and SOTA web agents\\nstruggle with these tasks, with a recall of 3% and 31%, respectively, despite\\nhigher performance on question-answering tasks.\\n  To address this challenge, we propose BardeenAgent, a novel framework that\\nenables web agents to convert their execution into repeatable programs, and\\nreplay them at scale across pages with similar structure. BardeenAgent is also\\nthe first LLM agent to take advantage of the regular structure of HTML. In\\nparticular BardeenAgent constructs a generalizable CSS selector to capture all\\nrelevant items on the page, then fits the operations to extract the data.\\n  On the WebLists benchmark, BardeenAgent achieves 66% recall overall, more\\nthan doubling the performance of SOTA web agents, and reducing cost per output\\nrow by 3x.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T06:16:40Z\"}"}
