{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05667v1\", \"title\": \"Oligarchic growth of protoplanets in planetesimal rings\", \"summary\": \"In the standard planet formation scenario, planetesimals are assumed to form\\nthroughout the protoplanetary disk and to be smoothly distributed in the radial\\ndirection except for the snowline. Planetesimal growth has been investigated\\nusing this assumption, and the oligarchic growth model is widely accepted.\\nHowever, recent simulations of gas and dust evolution have shown that\\nplanetesimals form only in radially limited locations -- such as at gas\\npressure bumps and snowlines -- and are concentrated in ring-like regions. When\\nplanetesimals are distributed in a ring-like region, scattered ones leak from\\nthe ring edge, resulting in planetesimal diffusion. To investigate protoplanet\\ngrowth in expanding planetesimal rings, we perform a series of $\\\\textit{\\nN}$-body simulations. In all the simulations, protoplanet growth is well\\nexplained by oligarchic growth, while the ring width expands due to\\nplanetesimal scattering by the protoplanets. Massive protoplanets tend to form\\nnear the ring center, and protoplanets that form far from the ring center are\\nless massive than those in the center. The scaled orbital separations depend on\\nneither the initial ring width nor on the total mass, and they are consistent\\nwith estimates based on the oligarchic growth model and the diffused\\nplanetesimal distribution. The width of the expanded planetesimal ring does not\\ndepend on its initial width, but it does depend on its total mass. The maximum\\nmass of protoplanets depends strongly on the total ring mass and weakly on its\\ninitial width.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T04:27:30Z\"}"}
