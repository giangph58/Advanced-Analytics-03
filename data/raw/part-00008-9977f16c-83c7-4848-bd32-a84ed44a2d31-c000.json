This result was proven by constructing a stabilising switching\\nfunction of unbounded switching frequency. The current paper proves that there\\nexists a switching function with bounded switching frequency which stabilises a\\nswitched affine system independent of its initial condition.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T10:41:06Z\"}"}
