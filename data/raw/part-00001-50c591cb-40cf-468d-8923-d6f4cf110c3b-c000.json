Over the past decades, artificial\\nintelligence and machine learning have played an increasingly significant role\\nin elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying motor function. The advancement\\nof brain-monitoring technologies, capable of capturing complex neuronal signals\\nwith high spatial and temporal resolution, necessitates the development and\\napplication of more sophisticated machine learning models for behavioral\\ndecoding. In this study, we employ a hybrid deep learning framework, an\\nattention-based CNN-BiLSTM model, to decode skilled and complex forelimb\\nmovements using signals obtained from in vivo two-photon calcium imaging. Our\\nfindings demonstrate that the intricate movements of both ipsilateral and\\ncontralateral forelimbs can be accurately decoded from unilateral M1 neuronal\\nensembles. These results highlight the efficacy of advanced hybrid deep\\nlearning models in capturing the spatiotemporal dependencies of neuronal\\nnetworks activity linked to complex movement execution.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.NC\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.NC,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T17:43:00Z\"}"}
