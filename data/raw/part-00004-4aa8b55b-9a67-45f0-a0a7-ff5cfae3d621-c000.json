{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15033v1\", \"title\": \"Blinding the Wiretapper: RIS-Enabled User Occultation in the ISAC Era\", \"summary\": \"An undesirable consequence of the foreseeable proliferation of sophisticated\\nintegrated sensing and communications (ISAC) technologies is the enabling of\\nspoofing, by malicious agents, of situational information (such as proximity,\\ndirection or location) of legitimate users of wireless systems. In order to\\nmitigate this threat, we present a novel ISAC scheme that, aided by a\\nreconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), enables the occultation of the\\npositions of user equipment (UE) from wiretappers, while maintaining both\\nsensing and desired communication performance between the UEs and a legitimate\\nbase station (BS). To that end, we first formulate an RIS phase-shift\\noptimization problem that jointly maximizes the sum-rate performance of the UEs\\n(communication objective), while minimizing the projection of the wiretapper's\\neffective channel onto the legitimate channel (hiding objective), thereby\\ndisrupting the attempts by a wiretapper of localizing the UEs. Then, in order\\nto efficiently solve the resulting non-convex joint optimization problem, a\\nnovel manifold optimization algorithm is derived, whose effectiveness is\\nvalidated by numerical results, which demonstrate that the proposed approach\\npreserves legitimate ISAC performance while significantly degrading the\\nwiretapper's sensing capability.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T11:41:28Z\"}"}
