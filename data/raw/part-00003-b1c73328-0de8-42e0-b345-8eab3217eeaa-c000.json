{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01782v1\", \"title\": \"Tensor free probability theory: asymptotic tensor freeness and central\\n  limit theorem\", \"summary\": \"Voiculescu's notion of asymptotic free independence applies to a wide range\\nof random matrices, including those that are independent and unitarily\\ninvariant. In this work, we generalize this notion by considering random\\nmatrices with a tensor product structure that are invariant under the action of\\nlocal unitary matrices. Assuming the existence of the \\\\emph{tensor\\ndistribution} limit described by tuples of permutations, we show that an\\nindependent family of local unitary invariant random matrices satisfies\\nasymptotically a novel form of freeness, which we term \\\\emph{tensor freeness}.\\nIt can be defined via the vanishing of mixed \\\\emph{tensor free cumulants},\\nallowing the joint tensor distribution of tensor free elements to be described\\nin terms of that of individual elements. We present several applications of\\nthese results in the context of random matrices with a tensor product\\nstructure, such as partial transpositions of (local) unitarily invariant random\\nmatrices and tensor embeddings of random matrices. Furthermore, we propose a\\ntensor free version of the central limit theorem, which extends and recovers\\nseveral previous results for tensor products of free variables.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OA\", \"categories\": \"math.OA,math-ph,math.MP,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T14:46:17Z\"}"}
