We present the supporting\\nmathematical framework and results from theoretical and real data use cases.\\nSelf-supervision removes the need for clean reference data while offering\\nstrong noise reduction. This provides the necessary tools for addressing\\nsignal-to-noise ratio concerns for GI acquisitions in emerging and cutting-edge\\nlow-light GI scenarios. Notable examples include micro- and nano-scale x-ray\\nemission imaging, e.g., x-ray fluorescence imaging of dose-sensitive samples.\\nTheir applications include in-vivo and in-operando case studies for biological\\nsamples and batteries.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG,physics.data-an\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T14:58:19Z\"}"}
