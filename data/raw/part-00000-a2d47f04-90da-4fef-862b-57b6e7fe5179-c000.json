This paper investigates the impact of augmentations on\\nimproving facial resemblance when using two prominent personalization\\ntechniques: DreamBooth and InstantID. Through a series of experiments with\\ndiverse subject datasets, we assessed the effectiveness of various augmentation\\nstrategies on the generated headshots' fidelity to the original subject. We\\nintroduce FaceDistance, a wrapper around FaceNet, to rank the generations based\\non facial similarity, which aided in our assessment. Ultimately, this research\\nprovides insights into the role of augmentations in enhancing facial\\nresemblance in SDXL-generated portraits, informing strategies for their\\neffective deployment in downstream applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T14:11:02Z\"}"}
