{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07565v1\", \"title\": \"Quadrilatero: A RISC-V programmable matrix coprocessor for low-power\\n  edge applications\", \"summary\": \"The rapid growth of AI-based Internet-of-Things applications increased the\\ndemand for high-performance edge processing engines on a low-power budget and\\ntight area constraints. As a consequence, vector processor architectures,\\ntraditionally designed for high-performance computing (HPC), made their way\\ninto edge devices, promising high utilization of floating-point units (FPUs)\\nand low power consumption. However, vector processors can only exploit a single\\ndimension of parallelism, leading to expensive accesses to the vector register\\nfile (VRF) when performing matrix computations, which are pervasive in AI\\nworkloads. To overcome these limitations while guaranteeing programmability,\\nmany researchers and companies are developing dedicated instructions for a more\\nefficient matrix multiplication (MatMul) execution. In this context, we propose\\nQuadrilatero, an open-source RISC-V programmable systolic array coprocessor for\\nlow-power edge applications that implements a streamlined matrix ISA extension.\\nWe evaluate the post-synthesis power, performance, and area (PPA) metrics of\\nQuadrilatero in a mature 65-nm technology node, showing that it requires only\\n0.65 mm^2 and that it can reach up to 99.4% of FPU utilization. Compared to a\\nstate-of-the-art open-source RISC-V vector processor and a hybrid vector-matrix\\nprocessor optimized for embedded applications, Quadrilatero improves area\\nefficiency and energy efficiency by up to 77% and 15%, respectively.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AR\", \"categories\": \"cs.AR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T08:56:03Z\"}"}
