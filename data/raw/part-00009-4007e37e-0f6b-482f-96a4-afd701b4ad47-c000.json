The coefficient appearing in the quantization of\\narea is fixed by an appeal to the saturated form of the Landauer's principle.\\nThen by considering transition between discrete states of the event horizon\\narea which in turn is equivalent to transitions between discrete mass states of\\nthe black hole, the change in the mass can be obtained. The change in mass is\\nthen equated to the product of the Hawking temperature and change in entropy of\\nthe black hole between two consecutive discrete states applying the first law\\nof black hole thermodynamics. This gives the corrected Hawking temperature. In\\nparticular, we apply this technique to the Schwarzschild black hole, the\\nquantum corrected Schwarzschild black hole, the Reissner-Nordstr\\\\\\\"{o}m black\\nhole which is a charged black hole, and the rotating Kerr black hole geometry,\\nand obtain the corrected Hawking temperature in each of these cases. We then\\ntake a step forward by inserting this corrected Hawking temperature in the\\nfirst law of black hole thermodynamics once again to calculate the entropy of\\nthe black hole in terms of the horizon area of the black hole. This leads to\\nlogarithmic and inverse corrections to the entropy of the black hole.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T12:14:52Z\"}"}
