{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21762v1\", \"title\": \"Spectra of Lorentzian quasi-Fuchsian manifolds\", \"summary\": \"A three-dimensional quasi-Fuchsian Lorentzian manifold $M$ is a globally\\nhyperbolic spacetime diffeomorphic to $\\\\Sigma\\\\times (-1,1)$ for a closed\\norientable surface $\\\\Sigma$ of genus $\\\\geq 2$. It is the quotient\\n$M=\\\\Gamma\\\\backslash \\\\Omega_\\\\Gamma$ of an open set $\\\\Omega_\\\\Gamma\\\\subset {\\\\rm\\nAdS}_3$ by a discrete group $\\\\Gamma$ of isometries of ${\\\\rm AdS}_3$ which is a\\nparticular example of an Anosov representation of $\\\\pi_1(\\\\Sigma)$. We first\\nshow that the spacelike geodesic flow of $M$ is Axiom A, has a discrete Ruelle\\nresonance spectrum with associated (co-)resonant states, and that the\\nPoincar\\\\'e series for $\\\\Gamma$ extend meromorphically to $\\\\mathbb{C}$. This is\\nthen used to prove that there is a natural notion of resolvent of the\\npseudo-Riemannian Laplacian $\\\\Box$ of $M$, which is meromorphic on $\\\\mathbb{C}$\\nwith poles of finite rank, defining a notion of quantum resonances and quantum\\nresonant states related to the Ruelle resonances and (co-)resonant states by a\\nquantum-classical correspondence. This initiates the spectral study of convex\\nco-compact pseudo-Riemannian locally symmetric spaces.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG,math.DS,math.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T16:02:16Z\"}"}
