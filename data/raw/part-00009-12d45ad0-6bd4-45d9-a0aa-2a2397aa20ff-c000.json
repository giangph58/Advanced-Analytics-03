{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15725v1\", \"title\": \"Low-overhead error detection with spacetime codes\", \"summary\": \"We introduce a low-overhead approach for detecting errors in arbitrary\\nClifford circuits on arbitrary qubit connectivities. Our method is based on the\\nframework of spacetime codes, and is particularly suited to near-term hardware\\nsince it has a much milder overhead in qubits and gates compared to error\\ncorrection, while achieving a better sampling overhead than existing error\\nmitigation methods. We present efficient algorithms for finding valid checks\\nthat are simultaneously low weight, satisfy connectivity constraints, and cover\\nlarge detecting regions within the circuit. Using this approach, we\\nexperimentally demonstrate error detection on circuits of up to 50 logical\\nqubits containing 2450 CZ gates, and show physical to logical fidelity gains of\\nup to $236\\\\times$. Furthermore, we show our algorithm can efficiently find\\nchecks in universal circuits, but the space of valid checks diminishes\\nexponentially with the non-Cliffordness of the circuit. These theoretical and\\nexperimental results suggest that Clifford-dominated circuits are promising\\ncandidates for near-term quantum advantage.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T09:20:25Z\"}"}
