While exercises and chat-based agents can evaluate\\nunderstanding in limited contexts, this challenge is magnified when learners\\nseek explanations that delve into procedural knowledge (how things are done)\\nand reasoning (why things happen). We hypothesize that an intelligent agent's\\nability to understand and explain learners' questions about skills can be\\nsignificantly enhanced using the TMK (Task-Method-Knowledge) model, a\\nKnowledge-based AI framework. We introduce Ivy, an intelligent agent that\\nleverages an LLM and iterative refinement techniques to generate explanations\\nthat embody teleological, causal, and compositional principles. Our initial\\nevaluation demonstrates that this approach goes beyond the typical shallow\\nresponses produced by an agent with access to unstructured text, thereby\\nsubstantially improving the depth and relevance of feedback. This can\\npotentially ensure learners develop a comprehensive understanding of skills\\ncrucial for effective problem-solving in online environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T05:25:52Z\"}"}
