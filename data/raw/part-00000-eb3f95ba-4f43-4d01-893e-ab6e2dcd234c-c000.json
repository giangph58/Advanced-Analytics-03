We first fit a Heisenberg\\nHamiltonian with twelve nearest-neighbour exchange interactions and single-ion\\nanisotropy to the experimental ground-state magnon dispersion. We then show via\\nspin dynamics simulations that our model Hamiltonian both reproduces the\\nexperimentally observed half-moon features and captures their persistence into\\nthe paramagnetic regime. Moreover, we identify the three-dimensional, competing\\nantiferromagnetic interactions driving this behavior. Our work complements\\nearlier studies of half-moon-shaped signatures in pyrochlore and triangular\\nstructures, by providing insight into their origin in a zigzag chain geometry\\nwith three-dimensional competing exchange interactions.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T04:01:00Z\"}"}
