{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11752v1\", \"title\": \"Real-Time Reconstruction of Ground Motion During Small Magnitude\\n  Earthquakes: A Pilot Study\", \"summary\": \"This study presents a pilot investigation into a novel method for\\nreconstructing real-time ground motion during small magnitude earthquakes (M <\\n4.5), removing the need for computationally expensive source characterization\\nand simulation processes to assess ground shaking. Small magnitude earthquakes,\\nwhich occur frequently and can be modeled as point sources, provide ideal\\nconditions for evaluating real-time reconstruction methods. Utilizing sparse\\nobservation data, the method applies the Gappy Auto-Encoder (Gappy AE)\\nalgorithm for efficient field data reconstruction. This is the first study to\\napply the Gappy AE algorithm to earthquake ground motion reconstruction.\\nNumerical experiments conducted with SW4 simulations demonstrate the method's\\naccuracy and speed across varying seismic scenarios. The reconstruction\\nperformance is further validated using real seismic data from the Berkeley area\\nin California, USA, demonstrating the potential for practical application of\\nreal-time earthquake data reconstruction using Gappy AE. As a pilot\\ninvestigation, it lays the groundwork for future applications to larger and\\nmore complex seismic events.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.geo-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.geo-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T04:06:50Z\"}"}
