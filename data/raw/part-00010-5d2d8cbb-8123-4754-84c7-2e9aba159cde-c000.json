In the context\\nof lattices, the analogy of the MacWilliams identity associated with\\nnu-function was conjectured by Sol\\\\'{e} in 1995, and we present a new formula\\nfor nu-function over the lattices associated with a ternary code, which is\\nrather different from the original conjecture. Furthermore, we provide many\\ncounterexamples to show that the Sol\\\\'{e} conjecture never holds in the general\\ncase, except for the lattices associated with a binary code.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:19:51Z\"}"}
