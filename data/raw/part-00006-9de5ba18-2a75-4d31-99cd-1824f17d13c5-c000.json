Loops\\nof charged leptons induce effective interactions of the ALPs with photons,\\nwhich depend on the momenta of the interacting particles and differ between\\npseudoscalar and derivative lepton couplings. We systematically discuss the\\nform of the interaction with photons for general external momenta and identify\\nthe regimes when it can be safely approximated by an effective coupling\\nconstant. We use these results to derive novel constraints from LEP and\\ncalculate state-of-the-art limits from E137 and NA64 for four different\\nscenarios, in which the ALPs couple either to a single lepton generation or\\nuniversally to all, for both pseudoscalar and derivative lepton couplings. We\\ncollect complementary bounds from astrophysics, flavour, and other laboratory\\nexperiments to chart the allowed parameter space of leptophilic ALPs in the\\nMeV-GeV mass range.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:58:09Z\"}"}
