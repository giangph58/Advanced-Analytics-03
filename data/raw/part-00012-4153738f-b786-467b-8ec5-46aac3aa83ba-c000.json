We focus on the quantum states associated with the\\n$T_{p,p}$ torus link complements, which is a $p$-party pure quantum state. The\\nreduced density matrices are obtained by taking the $(1|p-1)$ bi-partition of\\nthe total system. We show that the characteristic polynomials of these reduced\\ndensity matrices are monic polynomials with rational coefficients.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,math-ph,math.MP,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T11:04:30Z\"}"}
