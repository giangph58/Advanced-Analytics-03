{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15273v1\", \"title\": \"Efficient Testing Using Surrogate Information\", \"summary\": \"In modern clinical trials, there is immense pressure to use surrogate markers\\nin place of an expensive or long-term primary outcome to make more timely\\ndecisions about treatment effectiveness. However, using a surrogate marker to\\ntest for a treatment effect can be difficult and controversial. Existing\\nmethods tend to either rely on fully parametric methods where strict\\nassumptions are made about the relationship between the surrogate and the\\noutcome, or assume the surrogate marker is valid for the entire study\\npopulation. In this paper, we develop a fully nonparametric method for\\nefficient testing using surrogate information (ETSI). Our approach is\\nspecifically designed for settings where there is heterogeneity in the utility\\nof the surrogate marker, i.e., the surrogate is valid for certain patient\\nsubgroups and not others. ETSI enables treatment effect estimation and\\nhypothesis testing via kernel-based estimation for a setting where the\\nsurrogate is used in place of the primary outcome for individuals for whom the\\nsurrogate is valid, and the primary outcome is purposefully only measured in\\nthe remaining patients. In addition, we provide a framework for future study\\ndesign with power and sample size estimates based on our proposed testing\\nprocedure. We demonstrate the performance of our methods via a simulation study\\nand application to two distinct HIV clinical trials.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T17:57:53Z\"}"}
