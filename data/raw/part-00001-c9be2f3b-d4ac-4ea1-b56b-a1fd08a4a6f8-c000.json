By taking the median of $(2r-1)$ independent randomized quasi-Monte\\nCarlo (RQMC) samples, we demonstrate that the desired convergence rates can be\\nachieved without increasing the number of randomizations $r$ as the quadrature\\nsize $N$ grows for both bounded and unbounded integrands. For unbounded\\nintegrands, our analysis assumes a boundary growth condition on the weak\\nderivatives and also considers singularities such as kinks and jump\\ndiscontinuities. Notably, when $r = 1$, the median estimator reduces to the\\nstandard RQMC estimator. By applying analytical techniques developed for median\\nestimators, we prove that the affine matrix scrambled estimator achieves a\\nconvergence rate depending on the integrand's smoothness, and is therefore not\\nlimited by the canonical rate $\\\\mathcal{O}(N^{-3/2})$. However, this\\nsmoothness-dependent theoretical rate is not observed empirically in numerical\\nexperiments when the affine matrix scrambling yields a heavy-tailed sampling\\ndistribution. In contrast, the median estimator consistently reveals the\\ntheoretical rates and yields smaller integration errors than mean estimators,\\nfurther highlighting its advantages.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T09:09:58Z\"}"}
