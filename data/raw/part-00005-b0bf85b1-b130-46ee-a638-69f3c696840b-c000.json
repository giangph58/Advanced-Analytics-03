{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19929v1\", \"title\": \"Wahl singularities in degenerations of del Pezzo surfaces\", \"summary\": \"For any fixed $1 \\\\leq \\\\ell \\\\leq 9$, we characterize all Wahl singularities\\nthat appear in degenerations of del Pezzo surfaces of degree $\\\\ell$. This\\nextends the work of Manetti and Hacking-Prokhorov in degree $9$, where Wahl\\nsingularities are classified using the Markov equation. To achieve this, we\\nintroduce del Pezzo Wahl chains with markings. They define marked del Pezzo\\nsurfaces $W_{*m}$ that govern all such degenerations. We also prove that every\\nmarked del Pezzo surface degenerates into a canonically defined toric del Pezzo\\nsurface with only T-singularities. In addition, we establish a one-to-one\\ncorrespondence between the $W_{*m}$ surfaces and certain fake weighted\\nprojective planes. As applications, we show that every Wahl singularity occurs\\nfor del Pezzo surfaces of degree $\\\\leq 4$, but that there are infinitely many\\nWahl singularities that do not arise for degrees $\\\\geq 5$. We also use\\nHacking's exceptional collections to provide geometric proofs of recent results\\nby Polishchuk and Rains on exceptional vector bundles on del Pezzo surfaces.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG,math.GT,math.SG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:04:07Z\"}"}
