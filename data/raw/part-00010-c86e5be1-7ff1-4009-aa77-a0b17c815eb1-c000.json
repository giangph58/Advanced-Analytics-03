{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16803v1\", \"title\": \"Graph modification of bounded size to minor-closed classes as fast as\\n  vertex deletion\", \"summary\": \"A replacement action is a function $\\\\mathcal{L}$ that maps each graph $H$ to\\na collection of graphs of size at most $|V(H)|$. Given a graph class\\n$\\\\mathcal{H}$, we consider a general family of graph modification problems,\\ncalled $\\\\mathcal{L}$-Replacement to $\\\\mathcal{H}$, where the input is a graph\\n$G$ and the question is whether it is possible to replace some induced subgraph\\n$H_1$ of $G$ on at most $k$ vertices by a graph $H_2$ in $\\\\mathcal{L}(H_1)$ so\\nthat the resulting graph belongs to $\\\\mathcal{H}$. $\\\\mathcal{L}$-Replacement to\\n$\\\\mathcal{H}$ can simulate many graph modification problems including vertex\\ndeletion, edge deletion/addition/edition/contraction, vertex identification,\\nsubgraph complementation, independent set deletion, (induced) matching\\ndeletion/contraction, etc. We present two algorithms. The first one solves\\n$\\\\mathcal{L}$-Replacement to $\\\\mathcal{H}$ in time $2^{{\\\\rm poly}(k)}\\\\cdot\\n|V(G)|^2$ for every minor-closed graph class $\\\\mathcal{H}$, where {\\\\rm poly} is\\na polynomial whose degree depends on $\\\\mathcal{H}$, under a mild technical\\ncondition on $\\\\mathcal{L}$. This generalizes the results of Morelle, Sau,\\nStamoulis, and Thilikos [ICALP 2020, ICALP 2023] for the particular case of\\nVertex Deletion to $\\\\mathcal{H}$ within the same running time. Our second\\nalgorithm is an improvement of the first one when $\\\\mathcal{H}$ is the class of\\ngraphs embeddable in a surface of Euler genus at most $g$ and runs in time\\n$2^{\\\\mathcal{O}(k^{9})}\\\\cdot |V(G)|^2$, where the $\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\cdot)$ notation\\ndepends on $g$. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first parameterized\\nalgorithms with a reasonable parametric dependence for such a general family of\\ngraph modification problems to minor-closed classes.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:21:55Z\"}"}
