Here, we\\ninvestigate graded FeN films prepared by low-dose nitrogen implantation of Fe\\nepitaxial thin films. Combining Brillouin light scattering measurements and a\\nspin-wave theoretical approach, we show that nitrogen implantation induces a\\ngraded profile of both the in-plane and the perpendicular anisotropies along\\nthe film thickness. This graduation leads to a significant modification of the\\nspin-wave spatial localization and generates a marked frequency asymmetry in\\nthe spin-wave dispersion. Moreover, we find that the anisotropy profile, and as\\na consequence the dispersion relation, can be tuned on changing the\\nimplantation dose, opening a way for the potential use of the graded Fe-N films\\nin magnonic applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T12:45:28Z\"}"}
