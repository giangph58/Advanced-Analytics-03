We then provide a universal\\nproperty to such \\\"directed equalities\\\" by describing introduction and\\nelimination rules that allows them to be contracted only with certain syntactic\\nrestrictions, based on polarity, which do not allow for symmetry to be derived.\\nWe give a characterization of such directed equality as a relative left\\nadjoint, generalizing the idea by Lawvere of equality as left adjoint. The\\nlogic is equipped with a precise syntactic system of polarities, inspired by\\ndinaturality, that keeps track of the occurrence of variables\\n(positive/negative/both). The semantics of this logic and its system of\\nvariances is then captured categorically using the notion of directed doctrine,\\nwhich we prove sound and complete with respect to the syntax.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LO\", \"categories\": \"cs.LO,math.CT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:28:05Z\"}"}
