While blocking dynamics have been\\nextensively studied, the impact of geographical positioning on predictability\\nremains largely unexplored. This study provides a comparative assessment of the\\npredictability of Western and Eastern North Pacific blocking events, leveraging\\nanalogue-based diagnostics applied to CMIP6 MIROC6 simulations. Blocking\\nstructures are identified using geopotential height gradient reversal, with\\ntheir temporal evolution analysed through trajectory tracking and error growth\\nmetrics. Results reveal that Eastern blocks exhibit lower predictability,\\ncharacterized by rapid error divergence and heightened mean logarithmic growth\\nrates, whereas Western blocks display dynamical stability. Persistence analysis\\ngives no significant difference between eastern and western North Pacific\\nblocking events. Sensitivity analyses across varying detection thresholds\\nvalidate the robustness of these findings.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T16:00:26Z\"}"}
