{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05093v1\", \"title\": \"KMT-2022-BLG-1818Lb,c: A Cold Super-Jupiter with a Saturn Sibling\", \"summary\": \"We present the discovery and analysis of the sixth microlensing two-planet\\nsystem, KMT-2022-BLG-1818Lb,c, detected by a follow-up program targeting\\nhigh-magnification events. Both planets are subject to the well-known\\n''Close/Wide'' degeneracy, although for the first planet, which has a\\nsuper-Jovian mass ratio of $q_2 \\\\simeq 5\\\\times 10^{-3}$ in both solutions, the\\nClose topology, with a normalized separation of $s\\\\simeq 0.70$, is clearly\\npreferred by $\\\\Delta\\\\chi^2=26$. However, contrary to all previous two-planet\\nmicrolensing systems, the mass ratio for the second planet, $q_3$, is\\nsubstantially (factor of $\\\\sim 10$) different for the Close and Wide topologies\\nof the first planet. While this degeneracy is resolved in the present case due\\nto high-cadence follow-up observations, the appearance of this new degeneracy\\nindicates the need for caution in the analysis of future two-planet systems. A\\nBayesian analysis suggests that the host is likely a K-dwarf star in the\\nGalactic disk. The first planet is probably a super-Jupiter on a Jupiter-like\\norbit, while the second planet is a Saturn-class planet on either a\\nMercury-like or Saturn-like orbit.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T09:46:01Z\"}"}
