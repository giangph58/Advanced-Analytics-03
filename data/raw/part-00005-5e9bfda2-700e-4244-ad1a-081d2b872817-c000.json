In this work, we focus on\\n3D Keller-Segel equation with a quadratic logistic damping term $-\\\\mu \\\\rho^2$\\n(modeling density-dependent mortality rate) and show the existence of\\nfinite-time blowup solutions with nonnegative density and finite mass for any\\n$\\\\mu \\\\in \\\\big[0,\\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\big)$. This range of $\\\\mu$ is sharp; for $\\\\mu \\\\ge\\n\\\\frac{1}{3}$, the logistic damping effect suppresses the blowup as shown in\\n[Kang-Stevens, 2016] and [Tello-Winkler, 2007]. A key ingredient is to\\nconstruct a self-similar blowup solution to a related aggregation equation as\\nan approximate solution, with subcritical scaling relative to the original\\nmodel. Based on this construction, we employ a robust weighted $L^2$ method to\\nprove the stability of this approximate solution, where modulation ODEs are\\nintroduced to enforce local vanishing conditions for the perturbation lying in\\na singular-weighted $L^2$ space. As a byproduct, we exhibit a new family of\\ntype I blowup mechanisms for the classical 3D Keller-Segel equation.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T16:30:13Z\"}"}
