We\\ndevelop a theoretical framework examining three fundamental regimes: systems\\nconverging to complete disagreement, complete consensus, or both states\\ndepending on initial conditions. The phase behavior is governed by two key\\nchiral parameters - R measuring right-oriented influence and L measuring\\nleft-oriented influence in the network interactions. Our analysis reveals a\\nrich phase diagram featuring both continuous and discontinuous transitions\\nbetween disordered and ordered phases. The discontinuous transition emerges in\\nsystems with two absorbing states, where the final configuration depends\\ncritically on initial opinion distributions. The annealing approximation\\nprovides fundamental insights into how asymmetric social influences (chirality)\\nshape collective opinion formation, acting as a symmetry-breaking element that\\ndrives the system toward polarization or consensus.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T03:53:03Z\"}"}
