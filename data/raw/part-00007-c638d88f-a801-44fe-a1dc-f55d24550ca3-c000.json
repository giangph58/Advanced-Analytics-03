{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02407v1\", \"title\": \"F5R-TTS: Improving Flow Matching based Text-to-Speech with Group\\n  Relative Policy Optimization\", \"summary\": \"We present F5R-TTS, a novel text-to-speech (TTS) system that integrates\\nGradient Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) into a flow-matching based\\narchitecture. By reformulating the deterministic outputs of flow-matching TTS\\ninto probabilistic Gaussian distributions, our approach enables seamless\\nintegration of reinforcement learning algorithms. During pretraining, we train\\na probabilistically reformulated flow-matching based model which is derived\\nfrom F5-TTS with an open-source dataset. In the subsequent reinforcement\\nlearning (RL) phase, we employ a GRPO-driven enhancement stage that leverages\\ndual reward metrics: word error rate (WER) computed via automatic speech\\nrecognition and speaker similarity (SIM) assessed by verification models.\\nExperimental results on zero-shot voice cloning demonstrate that F5R-TTS\\nachieves significant improvements in both speech intelligibility (relatively\\n29.5\\\\% WER reduction) and speaker similarity (relatively 4.6\\\\% SIM score\\nincrease) compared to conventional flow-matching based TTS systems.
