{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01358v1\", \"title\": \"3D Gaussian Inverse Rendering with Approximated Global Illumination\", \"summary\": \"3D Gaussian Splatting shows great potential in reconstructing photo-realistic\\n3D scenes. However, these methods typically bake illumination into their\\nrepresentations, limiting their use for physically-based rendering and scene\\nediting. Although recent inverse rendering approaches aim to decompose scenes\\ninto material and lighting components, they often rely on simplifying\\nassumptions that fail when editing. We present a novel approach that enables\\nefficient global illumination for 3D Gaussians Splatting through screen-space\\nray tracing. Our key insight is that a substantial amount of indirect light can\\nbe traced back to surfaces visible within the current view frustum. Leveraging\\nthis observation, we augment the direct shading computed by 3D Gaussians with\\nMonte-Carlo screen-space ray-tracing to capture one-bounce indirect\\nillumination. In this way, our method enables realistic global illumination\\nwithout sacrificing the computational efficiency and editability benefits of 3D\\nGaussians. Through experiments, we show that the screen-space approximation we\\nutilize allows for indirect illumination and supports real-time rendering and\\nediting.
