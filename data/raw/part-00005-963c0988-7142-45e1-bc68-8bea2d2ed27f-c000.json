We study an example of such dynamics, given by a\\nLangevin diffusion for posterior sampling in a Bayesian linear regression model\\nwith i.i.d. regression design, whose prior continuously adapts to the Langevin\\ntrajectory via a maximum marginal-likelihood scheme. Results of dynamical\\nmean-field theory (DMFT) developed in our companion paper establish a precise\\nhigh-dimensional asymptotic limit for the joint evolution of the prior\\nparameter and law of the Langevin sample. In this work, we carry out an\\nanalysis of the equations that describe this DMFT limit, under conditions of\\napproximate time-translation-invariance which include, in particular, settings\\nwhere the posterior law satisfies a log-Sobolev inequality. In such settings,\\nwe show that this adaptive Langevin trajectory converges on a\\ndimension-independent time horizon to an equilibrium state that is\\ncharacterized by a system of scalar fixed-point equations, and the associated\\nprior parameter converges to a critical point of a replica-symmetric limit for\\nthe model free energy. As a by-product of our analyses, we obtain a new\\ndynamical proof that this replica-symmetric limit for the free energy is exact,\\nin models having a possibly misspecified prior and where a log-Sobolev\\ninequality holds for the posterior law.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T03:24:09Z\"}"}
