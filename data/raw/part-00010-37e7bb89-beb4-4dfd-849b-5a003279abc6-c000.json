{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07779v1\", \"title\": \"Genetic Programming with Reinforcement Learning Trained Transformer for\\n  Real-World Dynamic Scheduling Problems\", \"summary\": \"Dynamic scheduling in real-world environments often struggles to adapt to\\nunforeseen disruptions, making traditional static scheduling methods and\\nhuman-designed heuristics inadequate. This paper introduces an innovative\\napproach that combines Genetic Programming (GP) with a Transformer trained\\nthrough Reinforcement Learning (GPRT), specifically designed to tackle the\\ncomplexities of dynamic scheduling scenarios. GPRT leverages the Transformer to\\nrefine heuristics generated by GP while also seeding and guiding the evolution\\nof GP. This dual functionality enhances the adaptability and effectiveness of\\nthe scheduling heuristics, enabling them to better respond to the dynamic\\nnature of real-world tasks. The efficacy of this integrated approach is\\ndemonstrated through a practical application in container terminal truck\\nscheduling, where the GPRT method outperforms traditional GP, standalone\\nTransformer methods, and other state-of-the-art competitors. The key\\ncontribution of this research is the development of the GPRT method, which\\nshowcases a novel combination of GP and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to produce\\nrobust and efficient scheduling solutions. Importantly, GPRT is not limited to\\ncontainer port truck scheduling; it offers a versatile framework applicable to\\nvarious dynamic scheduling challenges. Its practicality, coupled with its\\ninterpretability and ease of modification, makes it a valuable tool for diverse\\nreal-world scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:18:22Z\"}"}
