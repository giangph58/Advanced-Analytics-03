In this\\ncontext, Artificial Intelligence methods have recently proven to be competitive\\nwith state-of-the-art Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP). This work focuses on\\nimproving the prediction of the occurrence of HPE over periods from 1 h to 24 h\\nbased on Neural Network (NN) models. The proposed method uses both\\nground-station observations and data from M\\\\'et\\\\'eo France's Arome and Arpege\\nNWP models, on two regions with oceanic and Mediterranean climates for the\\nperiod 2016-2018. The verification metric is the Peirce Skill Score. Results\\nshow that the NN model using only observations or NWP data performs better for\\nshorter and longer rainfall accumulation period respectively. In contrast, a\\nhybrid method combining both observations and NWP data offers the best\\nperformance and remains stable with the rainfall accumulation period. The\\nhybrid method also improves the performance in predicting increasingly intense\\nrainfall, from the 5% to the 0.1% rarest events. The choice of the loss\\nfunction is found to be an important aspect of this work, where only balanced\\nloss functions provide results insensitive to rare event frequency. Finally,\\nthe hybrid method is particularly well suited for the prediction of HPE in the\\nMediterranean climate, especially during the fall season, period during which\\nmost HPE occur.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:33:35Z\"}"}
