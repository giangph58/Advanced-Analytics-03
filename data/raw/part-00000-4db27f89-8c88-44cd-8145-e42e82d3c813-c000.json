Agent-based modeling (ABM) is widely\\nemployed to study social networks community, allowing us to define individual\\nbehaviors and simulate system-level evolution. It can be a powerful tool to\\ntest how the algorithms affect users behavior. To fully leverage agent-based\\nmodels,superior data processing and storage capabilities are essential. High\\nPerformance Computing (HPC) presents an optimal solution, adept at managing\\ncomplex computations and analysis, particularly for voluminous or\\niteration-intensive tasks. We utilize Machine Learning (ML) methods to analyze\\nsocial media users due to their ability to efficiently process vast amounts of\\ndata and derive insights that aid in understanding user behaviors, preferences,\\nand trends. Therefore, our proposal involves ML to characterize user attributes\\nand to develop a general user model for ABM simulation of in social networks on\\nHPC systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SI\", \"categories\": \"cs.SI,I.6.3\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T13:08:53Z\"}"}
