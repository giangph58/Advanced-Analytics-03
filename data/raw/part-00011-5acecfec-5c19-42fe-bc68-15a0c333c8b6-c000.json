In this paper, focusing on a common synthesis\\nmachine, which generates multiple DNA strands in parallel following a fixed\\nsupersequence,we propose constrained codes with polynomial-time encoding and\\ndecoding algorithms. Compared to the existing works, our codes simultaneously\\nsatisfy both l-runlength limited and {\\\\epsilon}-balanced constraints. By\\nenumerating all valid sequences, our codes achieve the maximum rate, matching\\nthe capacity. Additionally, we design constrained error-correcting codes\\ncapable of correcting one insertion or deletion in the obtained DNA sequence\\nwhile still adhering to the constraints.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T07:25:18Z\"}"}
