However, when extracting infinite-volume\\nscattering parameters from finite-volume energy levels, the traditional\\nL\\\\\\\"uscher formula encounters limitations due to the left-hand cut induced by\\nlong-range interactions such as the one-pion exchange. In this work, we propose\\nan alternative approach based on chiral effective field theory combined with a\\nHamiltonian method in the plane wave basis. By solving a Schr\\\\\\\"odinger-like\\nequation in the finite volume, our method connects the finite-volume energy\\nspectrum with infinite-volume observables, while systematically incorporating\\nthe long-range physics and solving the left-hand cut problem. The use of the\\nplane wave basis mitigates issues related to partial wave mixing. Our numerical\\nresults for $DD^*$ scattering at $m_\\\\pi \\\\approx$ 280 MeV demonstrate that this\\napproach overcomes the limitations of the L\\\\\\\"uscher method and points towards a\\nresonance interpretation of the $T_{cc}(3875)$ state, as opposed to the virtual\\nstate predicted by traditional analyses.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-lat\", \"categories\": \"hep-lat\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T10:49:56Z\"}"}
