In many CCPs, one optimizes an objective under\\na probabilistic constraint continuously parameterized by a random vector $\\\\xi$.\\nIn this work, we study the specific case where the constraint is quasi-convex\\nwith $\\\\xi$. Moreover, the support of vector $\\\\xi$ is a collection of $N$\\nscenarios in dimension $p=2$ or $p=3$. In general, even when both the\\nconstraint and the objective are convex in the decision variable, the feasible\\nregion of a CCP is nonconvex, turning it into a difficult problem. However,\\nunder mild assumptions, many CCPs can be recast as big-$M$ mixed-integer convex\\nprograms (MICP). Unfortunately, the difficulty of these MICPs explodes with the\\nnumber of scenarios, restricting the instances practically solvable in decent\\ntime. To cut down the effective number of scenarios considered in MICP\\nreformulations and accelerate their solving, we propose and test presolve\\ntechniques based on computational geometry. Our techniques produce certificates\\nto discard or select a priori some scenarios before solving a regular MICP.\\nMoreover, the information aggregated during presolve leverages the possibility\\nto strengthen big-$M$ constants. Our numerical experiments suggest that\\nspending some time in presolve is more efficient than a direct solve for a\\nclass of probabilistic projection problems, including an interesting type of\\nfacility location problem.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T08:11:38Z\"}"}
