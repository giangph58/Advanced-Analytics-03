{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11947v1\", \"title\": \"Dissecting coupled orders in a terahertz-driven electron-doped cuprate\", \"summary\": \"The interplay between superconductivity and charge density wave has often\\nbeen studied from an equilibrium point of view. For example, using static\\ntuning knobs such as doping, magnetic field and pressure, superconductivity can\\nbe enhanced or suppressed. The resulting effect on the co-existing charge\\ndensity wave order, if any, is judged by variations in its ground state\\nproperties such as the ordering temperature or the spatial correlation. Such an\\napproach can be understood as coordinated static displacements of two coupled\\norder parameters within a Ginzburg-Landau description, evincing their interplay\\nas either co-operative or competing but does not provide further microscopic\\ninformation about the interaction. In order to assess such information, we\\ndynamically perturb both orders from equilibrium and observe their coupling\\ndirectly in the time-domain. We show that high-field multicycle terahertz\\npulses drive both the Higgs amplitude fluctuations of the superconducting order\\nas well as collective fluctuations of the charge order in an electron-doped\\ncuprate, resulting in characteristic third harmonic generation. A notable time\\ndelay is manifested between their respective driven dynamics. We propose that\\nthis may signify the important energy scale describing their coupling or imply\\na terahertz field-depinned charge density wave that destroys macroscopic\\nsuperconductivity. Our work demonstrates a holistic approach for investigating\\ncoupled superconducting and charge density wave orders, which may shed novel\\nlight on their intertwined presence and widespread fluctuations in many classes\\nof unconventional superconductors.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T10:24:08Z\"}"}
