{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11981v1\", \"title\": \"Hardware-Friendly Delayed-Feedback Reservoir for Multivariate\\n  Time-Series Classification\", \"summary\": \"Reservoir computing (RC) is attracting attention as a machine-learning\\ntechnique for edge computing. In time-series classification tasks, the number\\nof features obtained using a reservoir depends on the length of the input\\nseries. Therefore, the features must be converted to a constant-length\\nintermediate representation (IR), such that they can be processed by an output\\nlayer. Existing conversion methods involve computationally expensive matrix\\ninversion that significantly increases the circuit size and requires processing\\npower when implemented in hardware. In this article, we propose a simple but\\neffective IR, namely, dot-product-based reservoir representation (DPRR), for RC\\nbased on the dot product of data features. Additionally, we propose a\\nhardware-friendly delayed-feedback reservoir (DFR) consisting of a nonlinear\\nelement and delayed feedback loop with DPRR. The proposed DFR successfully\\nclassified multivariate time series data that has been considered particularly\\ndifficult to implement efficiently in hardware. In contrast to conventional DFR\\nmodels that require analog circuits, the proposed model can be implemented in a\\nfully digital manner suitable for high-level syntheses. A comparison with\\nexisting machine-learning methods via field-programmable gate array\\nimplementation using 12 multivariate time-series classification tasks confirmed\\nthe superior accuracy and small circuit size of the proposed method.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T11:22:38Z\"}"}
