{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11761v1\", \"title\": \"Delayed Acceptance Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Robust Bayesian Analysis\", \"summary\": \"This study introduces a computationally efficient algorithm, delayed\\nacceptance Markov chain Monte Carlo (DA-MCMC), designed to improve posterior\\nsimulation in quasi-Bayesian inference. Quasi-Bayesian methods, which do not\\nrequire fully specifying a probabilistic model, are often computationally\\nexpensive owing to the need to evaluate the inverse and determinant of large\\ncovariance matrices. DA-MCMC addresses this challenge by employing a two-stage\\nprocess: In the first stage, proposals are screened using an approximate\\nposterior, whereas a final acceptance or rejection decision is made in the\\nsecond stage based on the exact target posterior. This reduces the need for\\ncostly matrix computations, thereby improving efficiency without sacrificing\\naccuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DA-MCMC through applications to\\nboth synthetic and real data. The results demonstrate that, although DA-MCMC\\nslightly reduces the effective sample size per iteration compared with the\\nstandard MCMC, it achieves substantial improvement in terms of effective sample\\nsize per second, approximately doubling the efficiency. This makes DA-MCMC\\nparticularly useful for cases where posterior simulation is computationally\\nintensive. Thus, the DA-MCMC algorithm offers a significant advancement in\\ncomputational efficiency for quasi-Bayesian inference, making it a valuable\\ntool for robust Bayesian analysis.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.CO\", \"categories\": \"stat.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T04:40:17Z\"}"}
