{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21815v1\", \"title\": \"From Aesthetics to Human Preferences: Comparative Perspectives of\\n  Evaluating Text-to-Music Systems\", \"summary\": \"Evaluating generative models remains a fundamental challenge, particularly\\nwhen the goal is to reflect human preferences. In this paper, we use music\\ngeneration as a case study to investigate the gap between automatic evaluation\\nmetrics and human preferences. We conduct comparative experiments across five\\nstate-of-the-art music generation approaches, assessing both perceptual quality\\nand distributional similarity to human-composed music. Specifically, we\\nevaluate synthesis music from various perceptual dimensions and examine\\nreference-based metrics such as Mauve Audio Divergence (MAD) and Kernel Audio\\nDistance (KAD). Our findings reveal significant inconsistencies across the\\ndifferent metrics, highlighting the limitation of the current evaluation\\npractice. To support further research, we release a benchmark dataset\\ncomprising samples from multiple models. This study provides a broader\\nperspective on the alignment of human preference in generative modeling,\\nadvocating for more human-centered evaluation strategies across domains.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.AS\", \"categories\": \"eess.AS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:21:04Z\"}"}
