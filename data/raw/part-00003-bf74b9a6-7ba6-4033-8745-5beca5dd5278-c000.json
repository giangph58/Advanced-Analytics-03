Below are two examples of proven results. The first statement: If\\n(M, g) be a connected, compact Riemannian manifold of even dimension n > 3\\nwhose Ricci and sectional curvatures satisfy the strict inequality n Inf (sec)\\n> Sup (Ric), then M is diffeomorphic to the Euclidean n-dimensional sphere of\\nsome radius r or the real projective n-dimensional space. The second statement:\\nThere is no harmonic immersion of an n-dimensional connected, complete\\nRiemannian manifold (M, g) into the Euclidean n-sphere of radius r if there\\nexists inf(Ric) such that Inf (Ric) > n/2r^2.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T10:07:18Z\"}"}
