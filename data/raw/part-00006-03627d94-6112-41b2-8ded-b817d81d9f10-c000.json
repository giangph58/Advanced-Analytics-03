We\\nshowcase the expressivity of this language through many examples, and we\\nestablish some aspects of the formal theory of Kan extension in this 2-category\\n(pointwise Kan extensions, fully faithful morphisms, etc.). We use this\\ntechnology to introduce fragments of geometric logic, and we accommodate\\nessentially algebraic, disjunctive, regular, and coherent logic in our\\nframework, together with some more exotic examples. We show that each fragment\\n$\\\\mathcal{H}$ in our sense identifies a lax-idempotent (relative) pseudomonad\\n$\\\\mathsf{T}^{\\\\mathcal{H}}$ on $\\\\mathsf{lex}$, the $2$-category of finitely\\ncomplete categories. We show that the algebras for $\\\\mathsf{T}^{\\\\mathcal{H}}$\\nadmit a notion of classifying topos, for which we deliver several\\nDiaconescu-type results. The construction of classifying topoi allows us to\\ndefine conceptually complete fragments of geometric logic.\", \"main_category\": \"math.LO\", \"categories\": \"math.LO,cs.LO,math.CT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T13:21:57Z\"}"}
