At\\nthreshold, optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) emerge from vacuum\\nfluctuations in the presence of a pump laser, and above threshold, OPOs seed\\nthe formation of intraresonator patterns and states, such as chaos and\\nsolitons. These competing nonlinear processes hinder an important application\\nof OPOs as wavelength-variable, low-noise sources. Recently, nanopatterned\\nmicroresonator OPOs have leveraged photonic crystal bandgaps to enable\\nuniversal phase matching and control of nonlinear interactions. Here, we\\nexplore a design paradigm optimized for high-output power that uses geometric\\ndispersion to suppress nonlinear interactions and a photonic crystal bandgap to\\nactivate only a single OPO interaction. Our devices convert an input pump laser\\nto output signal and idler waves with powers exceeding 40 mW while maintaining\\nspectral purity and side-mode suppression ratios greater than 40 dB. We show\\nthat this approach suits custom wavelengths by measuring four independent\\noscillators that vary only photonic crystal parameters to select output waves.\\nOur experiments demonstrate that microresonators functionalized by photonic\\ncrystals offer a versatile and lossless palette of controls for nonlinear laser\\nconversion.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:54:33Z\"}"}
