{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07014v1\", \"title\": \"Fermi surface as a quantum critical manifold: gaplessness, order\\n  parameter, and scaling in $d$-dimensions\", \"summary\": \"We study several models of $d$-dimensional fermions ($d=1,2,3$) with an\\nemphasis on the properties of their gapless (metallic) phase. It occurs at $T =\\n0$ as a continuous transition when zeros of the partition function reach the\\nreal range of parameters. Those zeros define the $(d-1)$-manifold of quantum\\ncriticality (Fermi surface). Its appearance or restructuring correspond to the\\nLifshitz transition. Such $(d-1)$-membrane breaks the symmetry of the momentum\\nspace, leading to gapless excitations, a hallmark of metallic phase. To probe\\nquantitatively the gapless phase we introduce the geometric order parameter as\\n$d$-volume of the Fermi sea. From analysis of the chain, ladder, and free\\nfermions with different spectra, this proposal is shown to be consistent with\\nscaling near the Lifshitz points of other quantities: correlation length,\\noscillation wavelength, susceptibilities, and entanglement. All the\\n(hyper)scaling relations are satisfied. Two interacting cases of the\\nTomonaga-Luttinger ($d=1$) and the Fermi ($d=2,3$) liquids are analysed,\\nyielding the same universality classes as free fermions.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.stat-mech,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T16:31:07Z\"}"}
