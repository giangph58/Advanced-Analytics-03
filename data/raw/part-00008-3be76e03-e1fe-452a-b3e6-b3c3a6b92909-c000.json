This paper argues for the use of\\nBayesian statistics as a principled framework to address these challenges.\\nBayesian methods enable the integration of domain expertise through prior\\nelicitation, allow for continuous learning from new data, and provide robust\\nuncertainty quantification via posterior inference. We demonstrate how Bayesian\\ninference can be applied to GenAI evaluation, particularly in incorporating\\nstakeholder perspectives to enhance fairness, transparency, and reliability.\\nFurthermore, we discuss Bayesian workflows as an iterative process for model\\nvalidation and refinement, ensuring robust assessments of GenAI systems in\\ndynamic, real-world contexts.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T16:31:15Z\"}"}
