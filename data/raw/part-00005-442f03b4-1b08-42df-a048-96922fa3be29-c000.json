Our package for rule-based data analysis, RuleKit, has proven its\\neffectiveness in classification, regression, and survival problems. Here we\\npresent its second version. New algorithms and optimized implementations of\\nthose previously included, significantly improved the computational performance\\nof our suite, reducing the analysis time of some data sets by two orders of\\nmagnitude. The usability of RuleKit 2 is provided by two new components: Python\\npackage and browser application with a graphical user interface. The former\\ncomplies with scikit-learn, the most popular data mining library for Python,\\nallowing RuleKit 2 to be straightforwardly integrated into existing data\\nanalysis pipelines. RuleKit 2 is available at GitHub under GNU AGPL 3 license\\n(https://github.com/adaa-polsl/RuleKit)\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T11:21:11Z\"}"}
