{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20597v1\", \"title\": \"How to be an orthodox quantum mechanic\", \"summary\": \"This work sets out to answer a single question: what is the orthodox\\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics? However, we adopt a different approach to\\nthat normally used. Rather than carefully surveying the precise details of the\\nthoughts of Bohr and Heisenberg, we extract an orthodoxy empirically. To do\\nthis we review a collection of 33 textbooks on quantum mechanics, encompassing\\nthe most popular and prominent works of this nature. We then gauge their\\nresponse to 12 propositions to build up a picture of exactly what is believed\\nby an orthodox quantum mechanic. We demonstrate that this orthodoxy is largely\\nunchanged over the past century, with some interesting emerging deviations, and\\nhas many aspects of Copenhagen-like viewpoints. However, it is more nuanced\\nthan some reductive characterisations that condense it down to the ontological\\nprimacy of the quantum state. The revealed orthodoxy has two main pillars:\\nmeasurement inherently disturbs quantum states and these states refer to\\nindividual instances, not ensembles. More fully it entails that individual\\nparticles exist in wave-like super-positions and present particle behaviours\\nonly when forced to by outside influences. The act of measuring such a system\\ninherently changes its state in a random fashion, manifesting in a form of\\nmeasurement error that corresponds to the uncertainty principle. This implies\\nthat measurement does not reveal underlying values of quantum properties.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.hist-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T09:50:54Z\"}"}
