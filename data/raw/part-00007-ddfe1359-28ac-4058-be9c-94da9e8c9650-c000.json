We show that the frequency dependence of\\ntemporal spin stiffness is crucial to obtain small values of correlation\\nlength, comparable to those observed in cuprates. Using the obtained spin\\nstiffnesses, we obtain the temperature and doping dependence of correlation\\nlength within the large-$N$ limit of the respective nonlinear sigma model. In\\nagreement with the experimental data on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ we obtain short\\nrange magnetic order with relatively small correlation length at $0.1 \\\\lesssim\\nx\\\\lesssim 0.2$, and magnetically ordered ground state in the narrow doping\\nregion $0.05\\\\lesssim x \\\\lesssim 0.1$. The latter state may correspond to the\\nspin-frosen state, observed in the experimental data on\\nLa$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T12:45:46Z\"}"}
