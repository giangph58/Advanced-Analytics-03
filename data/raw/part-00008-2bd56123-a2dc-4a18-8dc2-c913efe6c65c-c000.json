By representing the elastic\\nenergy through a stretching modulus, $K$, and a dimensionless ratio, $\\\\delta$,\\ncapturing the balance between stretching and bending energies, the model\\nreveals mechanical behaviors extending beyond conventional approaches.\\nValidated across microscale droplets and macroscale silicone sheets by fitting\\nexperimental force-displacement curves, this approach provides accurate,\\nscalable characterization of deformed elastic shells. This framework advances\\nour understanding of soft thin-shell mechanics, with broad applications in\\nprobing living cells and designing soft materials.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,physics.bio-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T03:30:24Z\"}"}
