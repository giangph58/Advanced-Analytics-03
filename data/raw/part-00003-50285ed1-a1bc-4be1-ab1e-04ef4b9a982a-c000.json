{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11442v1\", \"title\": \"TextArena\", \"summary\": \"TextArena is an open-source collection of competitive text-based games for\\ntraining and evaluation of agentic behavior in Large Language Models (LLMs). It\\nspans 57+ unique environments (including single-player, two-player, and\\nmulti-player setups) and allows for easy evaluation of model capabilities via\\nan online-play system (against humans and other submitted models) with\\nreal-time TrueSkill scores. Traditional benchmarks rarely assess dynamic social\\nskills such as negotiation, theory of mind, and deception, creating a gap that\\nTextArena addresses. Designed with research, community and extensibility in\\nmind, TextArena emphasizes ease of adding new games, adapting the framework,\\ntesting models, playing against the models, and training models.
