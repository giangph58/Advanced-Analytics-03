Topological phase diagrams are obtained for\\npotentials with various strengths and wavelengths. We find the lowest band of\\nthe interlayer exciton can become topologically nontrivial, which exhibits a\\nsmall bandwidth as well as quantum geometries well suited for realizing the\\nbosonic fractional Chern insulator. For monolayer excitons, topological bands\\nand in-gap helical edge states can emerge near the energy of 2p states.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T17:38:58Z\"}"}
