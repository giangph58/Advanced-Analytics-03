{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24256v1\", \"title\": \"Ranked percolation model for the caking time of amorphous molecular\\n  powders\", \"summary\": \"When amorphous molecular powders are exposed to high humidity levels or\\ntemperatures, the particle viscosity increases due to plasticization, promoting\\nthe formation of sinter bridges between pairs of particles in contact. Over\\ntime, these bridges facilitate particle agglomeration, eventually leading to\\nthe formation of a macroscopic cake that alters the mechanical properties and\\naffects product quality. In this work, we model the caking process of amorphous\\npowders subjected to a temperature shock as a bond percolation problem and\\ninvestigate how particle bed heterogeneities influence the percolation\\nthreshold and, consequently, the expected caking times. Our findings indicate\\nthat a slight dispersion in particle size lowers the percolation threshold\\ncompared to a monodisperse bed or random percolation in polydisperse systems.\\nFurthermore, we show that the expected caking time exhibits a non-monotonic\\nbehavior with the size dispersion, initially decreasing for low dispersion\\nvalues and increasing for higher values. These results provide insights into\\nthe role of the particle size distribution on the caking dynamics of amorphous\\nmolecular powders\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:03:56Z\"}"}
