{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21660v1\", \"title\": \"Fracton and Non-Lorentzian Particle Duality: Gauge Field Couplings and\\n  Geometric Implications\", \"summary\": \"Fractons, characterized by restricted mobility and governed by higher-moment\\nconservation laws, represent a novel phase of matter with deep connections to\\ntensor gauge theories and emergent gravity. This work systematically explores\\nthe duality between fractons and non-Lorentzian particles -- Carroll and\\nGalilean -- within electromagnetic (EM) fields. By constructing canonical\\nactions for fractons in rank-2 gauge fields, we derive their equations of\\nmotion and demonstrate that static fractons exhibit duality with\\nelectric-sector of Carroll particles, while mobile fracton dipoles correspond\\nto both electric and magnetic sectors of Galilean particles. The algebraic\\nunderpinnings of these dualities are clarified through symmetry analyses,\\nrevealing structural parallels between the fracton and Carroll/Galilean\\nalgebras. Furthermore, by gauging the fracton algebra, we develop a geometric\\nframework for fracton gravity, linking it to non-Lorentzian spacetime\\ngeometries. These results unify fracton dynamics with non-relativistic and\\nultra-relativistic limits of physics, offering insights into emergent gravity\\nand exotic condensed matter systems.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,cond-mat.str-el,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T16:24:08Z\"}"}
