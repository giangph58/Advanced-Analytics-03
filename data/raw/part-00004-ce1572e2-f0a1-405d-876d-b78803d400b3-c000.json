{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03451v1\", \"title\": \"Detecting Quishing Attacks with Machine Learning Techniques Through QR\\n  Code Analysis\", \"summary\": \"The rise of QR code based phishing (\\\"Quishing\\\") poses a growing cybersecurity\\nthreat, as attackers increasingly exploit QR codes to bypass traditional\\nphishing defenses. Existing detection methods predominantly focus on URL\\nanalysis, which requires the extraction of the QR code payload, and may\\ninadvertently expose users to malicious content. Moreover, QR codes can encode\\nvarious types of data beyond URLs, such as Wi-Fi credentials and payment\\ninformation, making URL-based detection insufficient for broader security\\nconcerns. To address these gaps, we propose the first framework for quishing\\ndetection that directly analyzes QR code structure and pixel patterns without\\nextracting the embedded content. We generated a dataset of phishing and benign\\nQR codes and we used it to train and evaluate multiple machine learning models,\\nincluding Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naive Bayes,\\nLightGBM, and XGBoost. Our best-performing model (XGBoost) achieves an AUC of\\n0.9106, demonstrating the feasibility of QR-centric detection. Through feature\\nimportance analysis, we identify key visual indicators of malicious intent and\\nrefine our feature set by removing non-informative pixels, improving\\nperformance to an AUC of 0.9133 with a reduced feature space. Our findings\\nreveal that the structural features of QR code correlate strongly with phishing\\nrisk. This work establishes a foundation for quishing mitigation and highlights\\nthe potential of direct QR analysis as a critical layer in modern phishing\\ndefenses.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T11:47:13Z\"}"}
