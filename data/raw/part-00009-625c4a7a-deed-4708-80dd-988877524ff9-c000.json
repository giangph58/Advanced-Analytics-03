The primary challenge in PRVR\\narises from the semantic asymmetry between textual and visual modalities, as\\nvideos often contain substantial content irrelevant to the query. Existing\\nmethods coarsely align paired videos and text queries to construct the semantic\\nspace, neglecting the critical cross-modal dual nature inherent in this task:\\ninter-sample correlation and intra-sample redundancy. To this end, we propose a\\nnovel PRVR framework to systematically exploit these two characteristics. Our\\nframework consists of three core modules. First, the Inter Correlation\\nEnhancement (ICE) module captures inter-sample correlation by identifying\\nsemantically similar yet unpaired text queries and video moments, combining\\nthem to form pseudo-positive pairs for more robust semantic space construction.\\nSecond, the Intra Redundancy Mining (IRM) module mitigates intra-sample\\nredundancy by mining redundant video moment features and treating them as hard\\nnegative samples, thereby encouraging the model to learn more discriminative\\nrepresentations. Finally, to reinforce these modules, we introduce the Temporal\\nCoherence Prediction (TCP) module, which enhances feature discrimination by\\ntraining the model to predict the original temporal order of randomly shuffled\\nvideo frames and moments. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate\\nthe superiority of our approach compared to previous methods, achieving\\nstate-of-the-art results.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T09:52:46Z\"}"}
