Quantum\\ncomputing has recently emerged as a powerful tool for tackling several machine\\nlearning tasks, but training quantum machine learning models remains\\nchallenging, particularly due to the difficulty of gradient calculation. The\\nchallenge is even greater for anomaly detection, where unsupervised learning\\nmethods are essential to ensure practical applicability. To address these\\nissues, we propose Quorum, the first quantum anomaly detection framework\\ndesigned for unsupervised learning that operates without requiring any\\ntraining.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.ET\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:27:39Z\"}"}
