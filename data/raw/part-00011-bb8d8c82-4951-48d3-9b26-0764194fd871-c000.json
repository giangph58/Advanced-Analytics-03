A latent class choice modelling approach for train station\\n  egress trips in the Netherlands\", \"summary\": \"Access/egress travel to train stations continues to pose a significant\\nbarrier to increasing the number of train travellers. Shared micromobility\\n(SMM), including bicycles, e-bikes, steps and mopeds, is often cited as a\\nprominent solution, especially for the activity-end of the trip chain. Using a\\nstated preference survey, we analyse activity-end mode-choice preferences for\\nSMM, walking and public transport (PT) among the Dutch population. By means of\\na latent class choice model, we uncover three user groups with respect to\\nactivity-end mode choice behaviour. The largest (58%) are Multimodal sharing\\nenthusiast, who choose based on the trade-offs between various travel\\ncharacteristics, while not having strong modal preferences. They are the most\\nopen, ready and able to use SMM. Sharing hesitant cyclists (16%) have a strong\\npreference for cycling and while they are open to using SMM , they may not feel\\nthemselves ready, stating that use of SMM can be difficult and dangerous.\\nSharing-averse PT users (27%) are most likely to use PT and avoid SMM as they\\nfind it too difficult and dangerous to use. The high preference to walk for\\nshort egress distances reaffirms the need for transit-oriented development\\npolicies. For longer egress distances, PT should be the primary focus at\\nstations in high-density areas with high demand, where high frequencies and\\ndense networks are justified, while stations in lower demand areas are better\\nserved by SMM. Providing multiple SMM options would result mainly in\\ncompetition for the same travellers.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:27:46Z\"}"}
