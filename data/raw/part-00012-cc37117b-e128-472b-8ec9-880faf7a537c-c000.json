However, discovering\\nnovel materials with considerable SHG is challenging due to the time-consuming\\nand costly nature of both experimental methods and first-principles\\ncalculations. In this study, we present a deep learning approach using the\\nAtomistic Line Graph Neural Network (ALIGNN) to predict NLO properties.\\nSourcing data from the Novel Opto-Electronic Materials Discovery (NOEMD)\\ndatabase and using the Kurtz-Perry (KP) coefficient as the key target, we\\ndeveloped a robust model capable of accurately estimating nonlinear optical\\nresponses. Our results demonstrate that the model achieves 82.5% accuracy at a\\ntolerated absolute error up to 1 pm/V and relative error not exceeding 0.5.\\nThis work highlights the potential of deep learning in accelerating the\\ndiscovery and design of advanced optical materials with desired properties.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cs.LG,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:03:22Z\"}"}
