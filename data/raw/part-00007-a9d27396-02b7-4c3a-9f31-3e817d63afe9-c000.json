{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11998v1\", \"title\": \"Hawking evaporation and the fate of black holes in loop quantum gravity\", \"summary\": \"A recent covariant formulation, that includes non-perturbative effects from\\nloop quantum gravity (LQG) as self-consistent effective models, has revealed\\nthe possibility of non-singular black hole solutions. The new framework makes\\nit possible to couple scalar matter to such LQG black holes and derive Hawking\\nradiation in the presence of quantum space-time effects while respecting\\ngeneral covariance. Standard methods to derive particle production both within\\nthe geometric optics approximation and the Parikh-Wilczek tunneling approach\\nare therefore available and confirm the thermal nature of Hawking radiation.\\nThe covariant description of scale-dependent decreasing holonomy corrections\\nmaintains Hawking temperature as well as universality of the low-energy\\ntransmission coefficients, stating that the absorption rates are proportional\\nto the horizon area at leading order. Quantum-geometry effects enter the\\nthermal distribution only through sub-leading corrections in the greybody\\nfactors. Nevertheless, they do impact energy emission of the black hole and its\\nfinal state in a crucial way regarding one of the main questions of black-hole\\nevaporation: whether a black-to-white-hole transition, or a stable remnant, is\\npreferred. For the first time, a first-principles derivation, based on a\\ndiscussion of backreaction, finds evidence that points to the former outcome.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T11:49:53Z\"}"}
