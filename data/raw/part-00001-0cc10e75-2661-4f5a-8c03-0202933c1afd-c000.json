To cognitively engage the\\ndecision-maker and to facilitate a deliberate decision-making process, we\\npropose a potential `reflection machine' that supports critical reflection\\nabout the pending decision, including the machine recommendation. Reflection\\nhas been shown to improve critical thinking and reasoning, and thus\\ndecision-making. One way to stimulate reflection is to ask relevant questions.\\nTo systematically create questions, we present a question taxonomy inspired by\\nSocratic questions and human-centred explainable AI. This taxonomy can\\ncontribute to the design of such a `reflection machine' that asks\\ndecision-makers questions. Our work is part of the growing research on\\nhuman-machine collaborations that goes beyond the paradigm of machine\\nrecommendations and explanations, and aims to enable greater human oversight as\\nrequired by the European AI Act.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T10:44:08Z\"}"}
