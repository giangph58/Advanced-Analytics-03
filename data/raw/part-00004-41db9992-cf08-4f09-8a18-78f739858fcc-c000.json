{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05437v1\", \"title\": \"Cell size heterogeneity controls crystallization of the developing fruit\\n  fly wing\", \"summary\": \"A fundamental question in Biology is to understand how patterns and shapes\\nemerge from the collective interplay of large numbers of cells. Cells forming\\ntwo-dimensional epithelial tissues behave as active materials that undergo\\nremodeling and spontaneous shape changes. Focussing on the fly wing as a model\\nsystem, we find that the cellular packing in the wing epithelium transitions\\nfrom a disordered packing to an ordered, crystalline packing. We investigate\\nbiophysical mechanisms controlling this crystallization process. While previous\\nstudies propose a role of tissue shear flow in establishing the ordered cell\\npacking in the fly wing, we reveal a role of cell size heterogeneity. Indeed,\\nwe find that even if tissue shear have been inhibited, cell packings in the\\nfruit fly wing epithelium transition from disordered to an ordered packing. We\\npropose that the transition is controlled by the cell size heterogeneity, which\\nis quantified by the cell size polydispersity. We use the vertex model of\\nepithelial tissues to show that there is a critical value of cell size\\npolydispersity above which cellular packings are disordered and below which\\nthey form a crystalline packing. By analyzing experimental data we find that\\ncell size polydispersity decreases during fly wing development. The observed\\ndynamics of tissue crystallisation is consistent with the slow ordering\\nkinetics we observe in the vertex model. Therefore, although tissue shear does\\nnot control the transition, it significantly enhances the rate of tissue scale\\nordering by facilitating alingment of locally ordered crystallites.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.bio-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.bio-ph,cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T17:27:31Z\"}"}
