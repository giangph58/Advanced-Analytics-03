It is assumed that the intensity of perturbations decays\\nwith time and the excitation frequency satisfies a resonance condition. The\\noccurrence and stochastic stability of solutions with an asymptotically\\nconstant amplitude are discussed. By constructing an averaging transformation,\\nwe derive a model truncated deterministic system that describes possible\\nasymptotic regimes for perturbed solutions. The persistence of resonant\\nsolutions in the phase locking and the phase drifting modes is justified by\\nconstructing suitable Lyapunov functions for the complete stochastic system. In\\nparticular, we show that decaying stochastic perturbations can shift the\\nboundary of stability domain for resonant solutions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T08:04:47Z\"}"}
