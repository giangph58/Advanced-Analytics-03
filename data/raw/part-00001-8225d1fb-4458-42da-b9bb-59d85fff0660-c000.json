Existing\\nlearning-based methods like Neural Two-Stage Stochastic Programming (Neur2SP)\\nemploy neural networks (NNs) as recourse function surrogates but rely on\\ncomputationally intensive mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulations. We\\npropose ICNN-enhanced 2SP, a method that leverages Input Convex Neural Networks\\n(ICNNs) to exploit linear programming (LP) representability in convex 2SP\\nproblems. By architecturally enforcing convexity and enabling exact inference\\nthrough LP, our approach eliminates the need for integer variables inherent to\\nthe conventional MIP-based formulation while retaining an exact embedding of\\nthe ICNN surrogate within the 2SP framework. This results in a more\\ncomputationally efficient alternative that maintains solution quality.\\nComprehensive experiments reveal that ICNNs incur only marginally longer\\ntraining times while achieving validation accuracy on par with their MIP-based\\ncounterparts. Across benchmark problems, ICNN-enhanced 2SP often exhibits\\nconsiderably faster solution times than the MIP-based formulations while\\npreserving solution quality, with these advantages becoming significantly more\\npronounced as problem scale increases. For the most challenging instances, the\\nmethod achieves speedups of up to 100$\\\\times$ and solution quality superior to\\nMIP-based formulations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:06:38Z\"}"}
