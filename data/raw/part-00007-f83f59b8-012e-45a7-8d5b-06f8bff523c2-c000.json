The proposed approach extends\\nthe eMbedded Profile for Joint Roughness (MPJR) interface finite element method\\nto incorporate both surface topography and spatially varying adhesion\\nproperties, imported directly from AFM measurements. The adhesion behavior is\\nmodeled using a modified Lennard-Jones potential, which is locally\\nparameterized based on the AFM-extracted adhesion peak force and energy\\ndissipation data. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through 2D\\nand 3D finite element simulations of a heterogeneous PS-LDPE (polystyrene\\nmatrix with low-density polyethylene inclusions) sample, where the bulk elastic\\nproperties are also experimentally characterized via AFM. The results highlight\\nthe significance of accounting for both surface adhesion variability and\\nmaterial bulk heterogeneity in accurately predicting contact responses.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CE\", \"categories\": \"cs.CE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T06:32:06Z\"}"}
