{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01524v1\", \"title\": \"On the limitations for causal inference in Cox models with time-varying\\n  treatment\", \"summary\": \"When using the Cox model to analyze the effect of a time-varying treatment on\\na survival outcome, treatment is commonly included, using only the current\\nlevel as a time-dependent covariate. Such a model does not necessarily assume\\nthat past treatment is not associated with the outcome (the Markov property),\\nsince it is possible to model the hazard conditional on only the current\\ntreatment value. However, modeling the hazard conditional on the full treatment\\nhistory is required in order to interpret the results causally, and such a full\\nmodel assumes the Markov property when only including current treatment. This\\nis, for example, common in marginal structural Cox models. We demonstrate that\\nrelying on the Markov property is problematic, since it only holds in\\nunrealistic settings or if the treatment has no causal effect. This is the case\\neven if there are no confounders and the true causal effect of treatment really\\nonly depends on its current level. Further, we provide an example of a scenario\\nwhere the Markov property is not fulfilled, but the Cox model that includes\\nonly current treatment as a covariate is correctly specified. Transforming the\\nresult to the survival scale does not give the true intervention-specific\\nsurvival probabilities, showcasing that it is unclear how to make causal\\nstatements from such models.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T09:10:48Z\"}"}
