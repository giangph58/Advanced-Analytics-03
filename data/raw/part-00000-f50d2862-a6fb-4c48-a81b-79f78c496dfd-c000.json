{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16704v1\", \"title\": \"Electronic Paddlewheels Impact the Dynamics of Superionic Conduction in\\n  AgI\", \"summary\": \"Solid-state ion conductors hold promise as next generation battery materials.\\nTo realize their full potential, an understanding of atomic-scale ion\\nconduction mechanisms is needed, including ionic and electronic degrees of\\nfreedom. Molecular simulations can create such an understanding, however,\\nincluding a description of electronic structure necessitates computationally\\nexpensive methods that limit their application to small scales. We examine an\\nalternative approach, in which neural network models are used to efficiently\\nsample ionic configurations and dynamics at ab initio accuracy. Then, these\\nconfigurations are used to determine electronic properties in a post-processing\\nstep. We demonstrate this approach by modeling the superionic phase of AgI, in\\nwhich cation diffusion is coupled to rotational motion of local electron\\ndensity on the surrounding iodide ions, termed electronic paddlewheels. The\\nneural network potential can capture the many-body effects of electronic\\npaddlewheels on ionic dynamics, but classical force field models cannot.\\nThrough an analysis rooted the generalized Langevin equation framework, we find\\nthat electronic paddlewheels have a significant impact on the time-dependent\\nfriction experienced by a mobile cation. Our approach will enable\\ninvestigations of electronic fluctuations in materials on large length and time\\nscales, and ultimately the control of ion dynamics through electronic\\npaddlewheels.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.stat-mech,physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T13:33:27Z\"}"}
