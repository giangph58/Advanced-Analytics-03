It has been used by the Arabs to spot lights on their major events\\nsuch as depicting brutal battles and conflicts. They also used it, as in many\\nother languages, for various purposes such as romance, pride, lamentation, etc.\\nArabic poetry has received major attention from linguistics over the decades.\\nOne of the main characteristics of Arabic poetry is its special rhythmic\\nstructure as opposed to prose. This structure is referred to as a meter.\\nMeters, along with other poetic characteristics, are intensively studied in an\\nArabic linguistic field called \\\"\\\\textit{Aroud}\\\". Identifying these meters for a\\nverse is a lengthy and complicated process. It also requires technical\\nknowledge in \\\\textit{Aruod}. For recited poetry, it adds an extra layer of\\nprocessing. Developing systems for automatic identification of poem meters for\\nrecited poems need large amounts of labelled data. In this study, we propose a\\nstate-of-the-art framework to identify the poem meters of recited Arabic\\npoetry, where we integrate two separate high-resource systems to perform the\\nlow-resource task. To ensure generalization of our proposed architecture, we\\npublish a benchmark for this task for future research.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T15:25:45Z\"}"}
