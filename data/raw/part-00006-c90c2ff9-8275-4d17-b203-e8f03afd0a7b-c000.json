{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11786v1\", \"title\": \"DART: Disease-aware Image-Text Alignment and Self-correcting\\n  Re-alignment for Trustworthy Radiology Report Generation\", \"summary\": \"The automatic generation of radiology reports has emerged as a promising\\nsolution to reduce a time-consuming task and accurately capture critical\\ndisease-relevant findings in X-ray images. Previous approaches for radiology\\nreport generation have shown impressive performance. However, there remains\\nsignificant potential to improve accuracy by ensuring that retrieved reports\\ncontain disease-relevant findings similar to those in the X-ray images and by\\nrefining generated reports. In this study, we propose a Disease-aware\\nimage-text Alignment and self-correcting Re-alignment for Trustworthy radiology\\nreport generation (DART) framework. In the first stage, we generate initial\\nreports based on image-to-text retrieval with disease-matching, embedding both\\nimages and texts in a shared embedding space through contrastive learning. This\\napproach ensures the retrieval of reports with similar disease-relevant\\nfindings that closely align with the input X-ray images. In the second stage,\\nwe further enhance the initial reports by introducing a self-correction module\\nthat re-aligns them with the X-ray images. Our proposed framework achieves\\nstate-of-the-art results on two widely used benchmarks, surpassing previous\\napproaches in both report generation and clinical efficacy metrics, thereby\\nenhancing the trustworthiness of radiology reports.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T05:39:08Z\"}"}
