{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04471v1\", \"title\": \"Hamiltonian Normalizing Flows as kinetic PDE solvers: application to the\\n  1D Vlasov-Poisson Equations\", \"summary\": \"Many conservative physical systems can be described using the Hamiltonian\\nformalism. A notable example is the Vlasov-Poisson equations, a set of partial\\ndifferential equations that govern the time evolution of a phase-space density\\nfunction representing collisionless particles under a self-consistent\\npotential. These equations play a central role in both plasma physics and\\ncosmology. Due to the complexity of the potential involved, analytical\\nsolutions are rarely available, necessitating the use of numerical methods such\\nas Particle-In-Cell. In this work, we introduce a novel approach based on\\nHamiltonian-informed Normalizing Flows, specifically a variant of Fixed-Kinetic\\nNeural Hamiltonian Flows. Our method transforms an initial Gaussian\\ndistribution in phase space into the final distribution using a sequence of\\ninvertible, volume-preserving transformations derived from Hamiltonian\\ndynamics. The model is trained on a dataset comprising initial and final states\\nat a fixed time T, generated via numerical simulations. After training, the\\nmodel enables fast sampling of the final distribution from any given initial\\nstate. Moreover, by automatically learning an interpretable physical potential,\\nit can generalize to intermediate states not seen during training, offering\\ninsights into the system's evolution across time.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:40:15Z\"}"}
