{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10025v1\", \"title\": \"Progressive Transfer Learning for Multi-Pass Fundus Image Restoration\", \"summary\": \"Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of vision impairment, making its\\nearly diagnosis through fundus imaging critical for effective treatment\\nplanning. However, the presence of poor quality fundus images caused by factors\\nsuch as inadequate illumination, noise, blurring and other motion artifacts\\nyields a significant challenge for accurate DR screening. In this study, we\\npropose progressive transfer learning for multi pass restoration to iteratively\\nenhance the quality of degraded fundus images, ensuring more reliable DR\\nscreening. Unlike previous methods that often focus on a single pass\\nrestoration, multi pass restoration via PTL can achieve a superior blind\\nrestoration performance that can even improve most of the good quality fundus\\nimages in the dataset. Initially, a Cycle GAN model is trained to restore low\\nquality images, followed by PTL induced restoration passes over the latest\\nrestored outputs to improve overall quality in each pass. The proposed method\\ncan learn blind restoration without requiring any paired data while surpassing\\nits limitations by leveraging progressive learning and fine tuning strategies\\nto minimize distortions and preserve critical retinal features. To evaluate\\nPTL's effectiveness on multi pass restoration, we conducted experiments on\\nDeepDRiD, a large scale fundus imaging dataset specifically curated for\\ndiabetic retinopathy detection. Our result demonstrates state of the art\\nperformance, showcasing PTL's potential as a superior approach to iterative\\nimage quality restoration.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.AI,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:28:10Z\"}"}
