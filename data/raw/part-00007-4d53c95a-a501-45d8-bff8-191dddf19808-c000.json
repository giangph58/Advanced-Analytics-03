We are interested in Flow-Based\\nMicrofluidic Biochips (FBMB), where a continuous flow of liquid is manipulated\\nusing integrated microvalves. Using microvalves and channels, more complex\\nFluidic Units (FUs) such as switches, micropumps, mixers and separators can be\\nconstructed. When running a biochemical application on a FBMB, fluid volumes\\nare dispensed from input reservoirs and used by the FUs. Given a biochemical\\napplication and a biochip, one of the key problems which we are discussing in\\nthis paper, is in determining the fluid volume assignment for each operation of\\nthe application, such that the FUs' volume requirements are satisfied, while\\nover- and underflow are avoided and the total volume of fluid used is\\nminimized. We illustrate the main problems using examples, and provide a review\\nof related work on volume management. We present algorithms for optimizing\\nfluid volume assignments and for reusing leftover fluids to reduce waste. This\\nalso includes the optimization of mixing operations which significantly impact\\nthe required fluid volumes. We identify the main challenges related to volume\\nmanagement and discuss possible solutions. Finally we compare the outcome of\\nvolume management using fixed- and arbitrary-ratio mixing technology,\\ndemonstrating significant reductions in fluid consumption for real biochemical\\nassays.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.ET\", \"categories\": \"cs.ET\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T13:52:14Z\"}"}
