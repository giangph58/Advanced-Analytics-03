The\\nhydrogen bonding was found to be favoured for a more distorted graphene\\nlattice. Indeed, a 100$\\\\%$ $sp^3$-saturation - the highest ever achieved - was\\nobserved after the hydrogenation of a sample with more pristine $sp^3$-like\\ndeformed bonds, while the flatter, more $sp^2$-arranged, sample reached a\\n59$\\\\%$ $sp^3$-saturation. Electron energy loss spectroscopy confirmed the\\nphotoemission result showing the $\\\\pi$-plasmon excitation quenching, in the\\ntotally hydrogenated sample, and significant reduction, for the other one. High\\nloading levels of hydrogenation were also witnessed by the opening of a wide\\noptical band gap (6.3 and 6.2 eV). The observation of the C-H stretching\\nvibrational mode is also reported, as a direct footprint of graphene\\nhydrogenation. Finally, valence band measurements of the 59$\\\\%$ saturated\\nsample suggest the coexistence of one-side and two-side hydrogenation\\nmorphologies.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T14:01:40Z\"}"}
