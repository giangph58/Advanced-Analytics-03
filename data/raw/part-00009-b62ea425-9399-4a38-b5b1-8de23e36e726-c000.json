However, both the reproducibility of the quantized thermal\\nHall conductivity and the fundamental nature of the associated heat carriers,\\nwhether bosonic or fermionic, are subjects of ongoing and vigorous debate. In a\\nrecent theoretical work, it was proposed that varying the sample geometry\\nthrough creating constrictions can distinguish between different origins of the\\nthermal Hall effect in magnetic insulators. Here, we provide experimental\\nevidence of chiral fermion edge modes by comparing the thermal Hall effect of a\\ngeometrically constricted $\\\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ sample with that of an\\nunconstricted bulk sample. In contrast to the bulk crystals where the thermal\\nHall signal fades below 5\\\\,K, the constricted crystals display a significant\\nthermal Hall signal that remains measurable even at 2\\\\,K. This sharp difference\\nagrees well with the theoretical prediction and provides compelling evidence\\nfor the contribution of chiral fermion edge modes to the thermal Hall effect in\\n$\\\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. More broadly, this work confirms that the geometry\\ndependence of the thermal Hall effect can help identify chiral spin liquids in\\ncandidate materials like $\\\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and paves the way for the\\nexperimental realization of thermal anyon interferometry.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T17:05:37Z\"}"}
