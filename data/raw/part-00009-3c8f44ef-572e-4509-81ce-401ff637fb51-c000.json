Despite their potential, these methods remain underexplored for\\nunambiguous discrimination. In this work, we derive performance bounds for such\\nmethods when applied to the discrimination of a set of pure states. The\\nperformance is evaluated based on the expected number of copies required. We\\nestablish a lower bound applicable to any sequential method and an upper bound\\non the optimal sequential method. The upper bound is derived using a novel and\\nsimple non-adaptive method. Importantly, the gap between these bounds is\\nminimal, scaling logarithmically with the number of distinct states.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:46:04Z\"}"}
