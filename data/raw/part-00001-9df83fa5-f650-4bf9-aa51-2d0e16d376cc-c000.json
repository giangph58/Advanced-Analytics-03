To provide context, we first discuss\\nInteractive Task Learning (ITL), the mechanisms of the human memory system, and\\nthe significance of natural language and multi-modality. Next, we examine the\\ncurrent state of cognitive architectures, analyzing their capabilities to\\ninform a concept of CCTL grounded in multiple sources. We then integrate\\ninsights from various research domains to develop a unified framework. Finally,\\nwe conclude by identifying the remaining challenges and requirements necessary\\nto achieve CCTL in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI).\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.CL,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T06:23:14Z\"}"}
