In active matter physics, most models\\nfocus on thermal fluctuations due to a surrounding solvent. An alternative but\\nmuch less explored noise source can occur due to fluctuating external fields,\\nwhich typically feature certain spatial correlations. In this work, we\\nintroduce a minimal model to explore the influence of spatially correlated but\\ntemporally uncorrelated noise on the collective behavior of active particles.\\nWe find that specifically in chiral active particles such fluctuations induce\\nthe formation of network patterns, which neither occur for spatially\\n(uncorrelated) thermal noise, nor in the complete absence of fluctuations.\\nThese networks show (i) a percolated structure, (ii) local alignment of the\\ncontained particles, but no global alignment, and (iii) hardly coarsen. We\\nperform a topological data analysis to systematically characterize the topology\\nof the network patterns. Our work serves as a starting point to explore the\\nrole of spatially correlated fluctuations and presents a route towards\\nnoise-induced phenomena in active matter.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T12:55:19Z\"}"}
