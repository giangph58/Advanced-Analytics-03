{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01725v1\", \"title\": \"Brillouin-enhanced four-wave mixing with optical chiral states\", \"summary\": \"Brillouin-enhanced four-wave mixing - also known as Brillouin dynamic\\ngratings - is an important nonlinear effect in photonics that couples four\\nlight waves by travelling acoustic waves. The effect has received a lot of\\nattention in the last few decades, especially for applications in fiber\\nsensing, signal processing and optical delay lines. Here, we report\\nBrillouin-enhanced four-wave mixing with optical chiral states (i.e. circular\\npolarization and vortex states) in twisted photonic crystal fiber, by\\nleveraging the topology-selective Brillouin effect. Phase-matching has the\\nconsequence that the travelling acoustic gratings created by\\ncircularly-polarized vortex pump and Stokes in the stimulated Brillouin\\nscattering can be used to modulate a frequency-shifted probe, where the\\npump/Stokes and probe have different circular polarization or topological\\ncharges. We demonstrate cross-frequency selective information transfer and show\\nthat the information is transferred only when pump and probe have opposite\\ncircular polarization.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T13:31:57Z\"}"}
