{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23868v1\", \"title\": \"Modelling Gaia photometry signals of dark halos\", \"summary\": \"We use the framework of microlensing to show that observations of binary\\nsystems, such as those made by {\\\\it Gaia}, combined with follow-up weak lensing\\nmeasurements, can provide a means to probe halos of exotic matter, possibly\\nclumped around compact objects such as black holes. This could potentially\\ncover a broad range of physical scenarios - from dark matter mini-halos to\\nblack holes with bosonic configurations around them, known as hair. Assuming\\nthat light can freely propagate through the halo of the exotic matter, the\\ncompanion star will produce characteristic, sizable lensing signatures due to\\nthe deviation from a central gravitational potential. The signature of the\\nmultiple images, the magnification and the light-curve could be the smoking gun\\nof such structures. We discuss how the precise observations of the {\\\\it Gaia}\\nsurvey offer an opportunity to search for new, yet undiscovered fundamental\\nfields interacting gravitationally with baryons.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T09:17:48Z\"}"}
