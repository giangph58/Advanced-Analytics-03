To demonstrate the usefulness and versatility of this framework, we focus\\non two fundamental problems: first, the prophet inequality problem, for which\\nwe provide an algorithm achieving\\n$\\\\max\\\\{\\\\frac{1}{2}-\\\\eta-o(1),\\\\frac{1}{e}\\\\}$-competitive ratio, where $\\\\eta$\\nquantifies the quality of the prediction. Second, we turn to the online metric\\nmatching problem under random arrivals, for which our main positive result is\\nan algorithm achieving the optimal cost under perfect advice, while smoothly\\ndefaulting to competitive ratios comparable to advice-free algorithms as the\\nprediction's quality degrades.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T05:08:23Z\"}"}
