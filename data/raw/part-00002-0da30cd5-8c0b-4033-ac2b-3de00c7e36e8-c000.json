A key challenge in BB-DO is epistasis among parameters where\\nmultiple variables must be modified simultaneously to effectively improve the\\nobjective function. Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) provide a\\npowerful framework for tackling BB-DO problems. In particular, an EDA\\nleveraging a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) has demonstrated strong performance\\non relatively low-dimensional problems with epistasis while reducing\\ncomputational cost. Meanwhile, evolutionary algorithms such as DSMGA-II and P3,\\nwhich integrate bit-flip-based local search with linkage learning, have shown\\nexcellent performance on high-dimensional problems. In this study, we propose a\\nnew memetic algorithm that combines VAE-based sampling with local search. The\\nproposed method inherits the strengths of both VAE-based EDAs and local\\nsearch-based approaches: it effectively handles high-dimensional problems with\\nepistasis among parameters without incurring excessive computational overhead.\\nExperiments on NK landscapes -- a challenging benchmark for BB-DO involving\\nepistasis among parameters -- demonstrate that our method outperforms\\nstate-of-the-art VAE-based EDA methods, as well as leading approaches such as\\nP3 and DSMGA-II.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NE\", \"categories\": \"cs.NE,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T05:56:22Z\"}"}
