Spin\\npolarization plays a key role in explaining the dynamics of quantum plasmas,\\nespecially in astrophysical contexts due to the high external magnetic field\\nprevalent in such environments. Effects specific to this particular\\nenvironment, like rotation as well as gravity, have also been included. Coupled\\ndispersion of electron, positron, and ion modes has been obtained. Further, the\\ninvestigation of solitary waves by the Korteweg de Vries method has been\\ncarried out, and a soliton solution has been obtained. Quantum effects increase\\nwave dispersion and soliton stability in quantum plasma, thereby affecting the\\nelectrostatic potential.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:07:55Z\"}"}
