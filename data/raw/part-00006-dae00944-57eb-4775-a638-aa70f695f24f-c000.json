{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02510v1\", \"title\": \"A complimentary impedance spectroscopy biosensing method with graphene\", \"summary\": \"We present a method where a bioactive functional layer on an electrically\\nconductive thin film with high sheet resistance can be effectively used for\\ncomplementary electrochemical impedance spectroscopy biosensing. The functional\\nlayer's properties, such as double-layer capacitance and charge-transfer\\nresistance, influence the complex impedance of the thin film in direct contact\\nwith the layer. These measurements can be performed using a simple\\nlow-frequency setup with a lock-in amplifier. When graphene is used as the\\nresistive thin film, the signal may also include contributions from graphene's\\nquantum capacitance, which is sensitive to charge transfer to and from the\\ngraphene. Unlike in traditional graphene biosensors, changes in electrolyte\\nproperties over time, such as those caused by the dissolution of ambient gases,\\ndo not significantly affect AC measurements. This technique supports biosensor\\nminiaturization, ensures stable operation, and provides reliable biomarker\\ndetection with a high signal-to-noise ratio.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.app-ph,physics.bio-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T11:52:55Z\"}"}
