The halo mass function\\n  in dynamical dark energy cosmologies\", \"summary\": \"The halo mass function (HMF) is fundamental for interpreting the number\\ncounts of galaxy clusters, serving as a pivotal theoretical tool in cosmology.\\nWith the advent of high-precision surveys such as LSST, eROSITA, DESI, and\\nEuclid, accurate HMF modeling becomes indispensable to avoid systematic biases\\nin cosmological parameter estimation from cluster cosmology. Moreover, these\\nsurveys aim to shed light on the dark sector and uncover dark energy's puzzling\\nnature, necessitating models that faithfully capture its features to ensure\\nrobust parameter inference. We aim to construct a model for the HMF in\\ndynamical dark energy cosmologies that preserves the accuracy achieved for the\\nstandard $\\\\Lambda (\\\\nu)$CDM model of cosmology, while meeting the precision\\nrequirements necessary for future cosmological surveys. Our approach models the\\nHMF parameters as functions of the deceleration parameter at the turnaround, a\\nquantity shown to encapsulate essential information regarding the impact of\\ndynamical dark energy on structure formation. We calibrate the model using\\nresults from a comprehensive suite of $N$-body simulations spanning various\\ncosmological scenarios, ensuring sub-percent systematic accuracy. We present an\\nHMF model tailored for dynamical dark energy cosmologies. The model is\\ncalibrated following a Bayesian approach, and its uncertainty is characterized\\nby a single parameter controlling its systematic error, which remains at the\\nsub-percent level. This ensures that theoretical uncertainties from our model\\nare subdominant relative to other error sources in future cluster number counts\\nanalyses.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T09:59:51Z\"}"}
