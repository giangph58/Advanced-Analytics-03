Existing alternating optimization algorithms can effectively\\noptimize the hybrid beamforming of HMIMO to improve the system performance,\\nwhile their high computational complexity hinders real-time application. In\\nthis paper, we propose a model-based deep neural network (MB-DNN), which\\nleverages permutation equivalent properties and the optimal beamforming\\nstructure to jointly optimize the holographic and digital beamforming.\\nSimulation results demonstrate that the proposed MB-DNN outperforms benchmark\\nschemes and requires much less inference time than existing alternating\\noptimization algorithms.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T06:40:41Z\"}"}
