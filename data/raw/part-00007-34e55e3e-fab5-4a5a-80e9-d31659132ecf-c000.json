We take pyrene as an\\nexample PAH and investigate how different degrees of superhydrogenation affects\\nthe applicability of the harmonic approximation and the role of temperature in\\nIR spectra of PAHs. This is achieved by comparing theoretical IR spectra\\ngenerated by classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and experimental IR\\nspectra obtained via gas-phase action spectroscopy which utilizes the Infrared\\nMultiple Photon Dissociation (IRMPD). All simulations are accelerated by a\\nmachine learning interatomic potential, in order to reach first principle\\naccuracies while keeping low computational costs. We have found that the\\nharmonic approximation with empirical scaling factors is able to reproduce\\nexperimental band profile of pristine and partially superhydrogenated pyrene\\ncations. However, a MD-based anharmonic treatment is mandatory in the case of\\nfully superhydrogenated pyrene cation for matching theory and experiment. In\\naddition, band shifts and broadenings as the temperature increases are\\ninvestigated in detail. Those findings may aid in the interpretation of JWST\\nobservations on the variations in band positions and widths of interstellar\\ndust.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T09:24:18Z\"}"}
