Motivated by\\nthat work, this paper studies Weyl's law and the semiclassical Weyl's law for\\nSchr\\\\\\\"odinger operators of the form $\\\\Delta + V$ and $\\\\hbar^2\\\\Delta + V$ on\\nnoncompact complete manifolds with bounded geometry. We assume that the\\npotential $V(x)$ satisfies certain H\\\\\\\"older continuity conditions and tends to\\n$+\\\\infty$ as $x$ approaches infinity.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG,math.AP,math.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T03:14:28Z\"}"}
