{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03629v1\", \"title\": \"DNA Tails for Molecular Flash Memory\", \"summary\": \"DNA-based data storage systems face practical challenges due to the high cost\\nof DNA synthesis. A strategy to address the problem entails encoding data via\\ntopological modifications of the DNA sugar-phosphate backbone. The DNA\\nPunchcards system, which introduces nicks (cuts) in the DNA backbone, encodes\\nonly one bit per nicking site, limiting density. We propose \\\\emph{DNA Tails,} a\\nstorage paradigm that encodes nonbinary symbols at nicking sites by growing\\nenzymatically synthesized single-stranded DNA of varied lengths. The average\\ntail lengths encode multiple information bits and are controlled via a\\nstaggered nicking-tail extension process. We demonstrate the feasibility of\\nthis encoding approach experimentally and identify common sources of errors,\\nsuch as calibration errors and stumped tail growth errors. To mitigate\\ncalibration errors, we use rank modulation proposed for flash memory. To\\ncorrect stumped tail growth errors, we introduce a new family of rank\\nmodulation codes that can correct ``stuck-at'' errors. Our analytical results\\ninclude constructions for order-optimal-redundancy permutation codes and\\naccompanying encoding and decoding algorithms.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.ET\", \"categories\": \"cs.ET,cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:28:23Z\"}"}
