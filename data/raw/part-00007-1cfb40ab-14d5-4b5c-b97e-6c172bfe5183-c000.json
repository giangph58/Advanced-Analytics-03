In order to achieve the above result, we first establish that\\nthe averaged modulus of smoothness is finite for certain suitable subspaces of\\n$L^{p,q}(\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\times\\\\mathbb{R}).$ Using the properties of averaged modulus\\nof smoothness, we estimate the rate of approximation of certain linear\\noperators in mixed Lebesgue norm. Then, as an application of these linear\\noperators, we obtain the Jackson type approximation theorem, in order to give a\\ncharacterization for the rate of approximation of neural network operators\\nin-terms of averaged modulus of smoothness in mixed norm. Lastly, we discuss\\nsome examples of sigmoidal functions and using these sigmoidal functions, we\\nshow the implementation of continuous and discontinuous functions by neural\\nnetwork operators.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T13:16:17Z\"}"}
