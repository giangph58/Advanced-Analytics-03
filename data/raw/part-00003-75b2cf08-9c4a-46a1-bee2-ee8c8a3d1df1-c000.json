We depart from the fact that Lie groups with\\na bi-invariant galilean structure can be seen as the quotient by a null central\\nsubgroup of a generalised Nappi--Witten group. We implement the quotient by a\\nchiral null gauging. We use a particular free field realisation of the\\nNappi--Witten current algebra to compute the Virasoro BRST cohomology of the\\ngauged WZW model, resulting in a closed string theory reminiscent of the\\nbosonic Gomis--Ooguri string, but whose spectrum differs slightly between the\\nholomorphic and antiholomorphic sectors.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T12:01:24Z\"}"}
