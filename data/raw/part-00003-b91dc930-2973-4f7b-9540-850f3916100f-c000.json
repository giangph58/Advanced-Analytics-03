{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10273v1\", \"title\": \"Sidecar: A Structure-Preserving Framework for Solving Partial\\n  Differential Equations with Neural Networks\", \"summary\": \"Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with neural networks (NNs) has\\nshown great potential in various scientific and engineering fields. However,\\nmost existing NN solvers mainly focus on satisfying the given PDEs, without\\nexplicitly considering intrinsic physical properties such as mass conservation\\nor energy dissipation. This limitation can result in unstable or nonphysical\\nsolutions, particularly in long-term simulations. To address this issue, we\\npropose Sidecar, a novel framework that enhances the accuracy and physical\\nconsistency of existing NN solvers by incorporating structure-preserving\\nknowledge. Inspired by the Time-Dependent Spectral Renormalization (TDSR)\\napproach, our Sidecar framework introduces a small copilot network, which is\\ntrained to guide the existing NN solver in preserving physical structure. This\\nframework is designed to be highly flexible, enabling the incorporation of\\nstructure-preserving principles from diverse PDEs into a wide range of NN\\nsolvers. Our experimental results on benchmark PDEs demonstrate the improvement\\nof the existing neural network solvers in terms of accuracy and consistency\\nwith structure-preserving properties.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.NA,math.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T14:40:11Z\"}"}
