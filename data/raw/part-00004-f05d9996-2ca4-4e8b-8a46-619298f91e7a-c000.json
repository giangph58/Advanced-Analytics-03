{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04981v1\", \"title\": \"Graph Neural Network Aided Deep Reinforcement Learning for Resource\\n  Allocation in Dynamic Terahertz UAV Networks\", \"summary\": \"Terahertz (THz) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks with flexible\\ntopologies and ultra-high data rates are expected to empower numerous\\napplications in security surveillance, disaster response, and environmental\\nmonitoring, among others. However, the dynamic topologies hinder the efficient\\nlong-term joint power and antenna array resource allocation for THz links among\\nUAVs. Furthermore, the continuous nature of power and the discrete nature of\\nantennas cause this joint resource allocation problem to be a mixed-integer\\nnonlinear programming (MINLP) problem with non-convexity and NP-hardness.\\nInspired by recent rapid advancements in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), a\\ngraph neural network (GNN) aided DRL algorithm for resource allocation in the\\ndynamic THz UAV network with an emphasis on self-node features (GLOVE) is\\nproposed in this paper, with the aim of resource efficiency (RE) maximization.\\nWhen training the allocation policy for each UAV, GLOVE learns the relationship\\nbetween this UAV and its neighboring UAVs via GNN, while also emphasizing the\\nimportant self-node features of this UAV. In addition, a multi-task structure\\nis leveraged by GLOVE to cooperatively train resource allocation decisions for\\nthe power and sub-arrays of all UAVs. Experimental results illustrate that\\nGLOVE outperforms benchmark schemes in terms of the highest RE and the lowest\\nlatency. Moreover, unlike the benchmark methods with severe packet loss, GLOVE\\nmaintains zero packet loss during the entire training process, demonstrating\\nits better robustness under the highly dynamic THz UAV network.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T06:36:17Z\"}"}
