The main element of novelty with respect to the\\nprevious work of the first and third author is that we do not assume the\\nsplitting induced by the second differential at a critical point to persist in\\na neighborhood, provided one can give precise estimates on how much persistence\\nfails. This allows us to enlarge significantly the class of elliptic pde's for\\nwhich non-degeneracy holds and Morse homology can be defined. A concrete\\nexample is given by equations involving the $p$-Laplacian, $p\\\\leq n$. As a\\nbyproduct, we provide a criterion of independent interest to check whether\\ncritical points are non-degenerate in the sense above, and give an abstract\\nconstruction of Morse homology in a Banach setting for functionals satisfying\\nthe Cerami condition.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T12:14:45Z\"}"}
