{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06715v1\", \"title\": \"Bistability and complex bifurcation diagrams generated by waning and\\n  boosting of immunity\", \"summary\": \"We investigate an epidemiological model that incorporates waning of immunity\\nat the individual level and boosting of the immune system upon re-exposure to\\nthe pathogen. When immunity is fully restored upon boosting, the system can be\\nexpressed as an SIRS-type model with discrete and distributed delays. We\\nconduct a numerical bifurcation analysis varying the boosting force and the\\nmaximum period of immunity (in the absence of boosting), while keeping other\\nparameters fixed at values representative of a highly infectious disease like\\npertussis. The stability switches of the endemic equilibrium, identified\\nnumerically, are validated using an established analytical approach, confirming\\nthat the equilibrium is unstable in a bounded parameter region, and stable\\noutside this region. Using recently developed continuation methods for models\\nwith discrete and distributed delays, we explore periodic solutions and their\\nbifurcations. Our analysis significantly extends previous findings and reveals\\na rich dynamical landscape, including catastrophic bifurcations of limit\\ncycles, torus bifurcations, and bistability regions where two stable periodic\\nsolutions coexist, differing in amplitude and period. These complex\\nbifurcations have critical public health implications: perturbations--such as\\nnon-pharmaceutical interventions--can shift the system between attractors,\\nleading to long-term consequences from short-term measures.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T09:16:35Z\"}"}
