{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21302v1\", \"title\": \"CMD: Constraining Multimodal Distribution for Domain Adaptation in\\n  Stereo Matching\", \"summary\": \"Recently, learning-based stereo matching methods have achieved great\\nimprovement in public benchmarks, where soft argmin and smooth L1 loss play a\\ncore contribution to their success. However, in unsupervised domain adaptation\\nscenarios, we observe that these two operations often yield multimodal\\ndisparity probability distributions in target domains, resulting in degraded\\ngeneralization. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Constrain\\nMulti-modal Distribution (CMD), to address this issue. Specifically, we\\nintroduce \\\\textit{uncertainty-regularized minimization} and \\\\textit{anisotropic\\nsoft argmin} to encourage the network to produce predominantly unimodal\\ndisparity distributions in the target domain, thereby improving prediction\\naccuracy. Experimentally, we apply the proposed method to multiple\\nrepresentative stereo-matching networks and conduct domain adaptation from\\nsynthetic data to unlabeled real-world scenes. Results consistently demonstrate\\nimproved generalization in both top-performing and domain-adaptable\\nstereo-matching models.
