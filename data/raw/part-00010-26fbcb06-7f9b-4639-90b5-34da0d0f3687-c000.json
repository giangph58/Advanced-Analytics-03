Here, we perform a\\nsingle-shot powder x-ray diffraction experiment on CuGaCr$_{4}$S$_{8}$ in a\\npulsed high magnetic field of 55 T, revealing an orthorhombic-to-cubic (or\\npseudocubic) structural transition upon entering the 1/2-magnetization plateau\\nphase at low temperatures. This observation suggests the emergence of a\\ncommensurate ferrimagnetic order, where a 3-up-1-down spin configuration is\\nrealized in each small tetrahedron, and the all-up or all-down in each large\\ntetrahedron. We propose two types of 16-sublattice magnetic structures, which\\nare degenerate within exchange interactions between the first, second, and\\nthird nearest neighbors.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T03:55:12Z\"}"}
