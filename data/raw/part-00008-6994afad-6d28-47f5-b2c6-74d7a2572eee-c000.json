{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10263v1\", \"title\": \"Quantized Axial Charge in the Hamiltonian Approach to Wilson Fermions\", \"summary\": \"We investigate the Hamiltonian formulation of 1+1~D staggered fermions and\\nreconstruct vector and axial charge operators, found by Arkya Chatterjee et\\nal., using the Wilson fermion formalism. These operators commute with the\\nHamiltonian and become the generators of vector and axial $\\\\mathrm{U}(1)$\\nsymmetries in the continuum limit. An interesting feature of the axial charge\\noperator is that it acts locally on operators and has quantized eigenvalues in\\nmomentum space. Therefore, the eigenstates of this operator can be interpreted\\nas fermion states with a well-defined integer chirality, analogous to those in\\nthe continuum theory. This allows us to realize a gauge theory where the axial\\n$\\\\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ symmetry acts as a gauge symmetry. We construct a Hamiltonian\\nusing the eigenstates of the axial charge operator, preserving exact axial\\nsymmetry on the lattice and vector symmetry in the continuum. As applications,\\nwe examine the implementation of the Symmetric Mass Generation (SMG) mechanism\\nin the $1^4(-1)^4$ and 3-4-5-0 models. Our formulation supports\\nsymmetry-preserving interactions with quantized chiral charges, although\\nfurther numerical studies are required to verify the SMG mechanism in\\ninteracting models.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-lat\", \"categories\": \"hep-lat,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T14:28:30Z\"}"}
