We show that this is\\nthe case when $M$ has non-negative sectional curvature and quadratic volume\\ngrowth at infinity. Moreover, we obtain that the boundary of the perimeter\\nminimizing set is identified with a slice in the product structure of $M$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:58:58Z\"}"}
