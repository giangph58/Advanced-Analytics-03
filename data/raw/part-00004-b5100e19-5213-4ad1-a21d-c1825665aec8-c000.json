{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04228v1\", \"title\": \"Low Resolution Next Best View for Robot Packing\", \"summary\": \"Automating the packing of objects with robots is a key challenge in\\nindustrial automation, where efficient object perception plays a fundamental\\nrole. This paper focuses on scenarios where precise 3D reconstruction is not\\nrequired, prioritizing cost-effective and scalable solutions. The proposed\\nLow-Resolution Next Best View (LR-NBV) algorithm leverages a utility function\\nthat balances pose redundancy and acquisition density, ensuring efficient\\nobject reconstruction. Experimental validation demonstrates that LR-NBV\\nconsistently outperforms standard NBV approaches, achieving comparable accuracy\\nwith significantly fewer poses. This method proves highly suitable for\\napplications requiring efficiency, scalability, and adaptability without\\nrelying on high-precision sensing.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:26:53Z\"}"}
