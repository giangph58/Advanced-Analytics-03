However, most invariant learning\\nmethods rely on the assumption that training examples are pre-partitioned into\\ndifferent known environments. We instead infer environments without the need\\nfor additional annotations, motivated by observations of the properties within\\nthe representation space of a trained ERM model. We show the preliminary\\neffectiveness of our approach on the ColoredMNIST benchmark, achieving\\nperformance comparable to methods requiring explicit environment labels and on\\npar with an annotation-free method that poses strong restrictions on the ERM\\nreference model.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T08:10:06Z\"}"}
