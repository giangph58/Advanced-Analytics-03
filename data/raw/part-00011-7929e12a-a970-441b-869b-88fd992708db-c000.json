{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10961v1\", \"title\": \"Evaluating Trust in AI, Human, and Co-produced Feedback Among\\n  Undergraduate Students\", \"summary\": \"As generative AI transforms educational feedback practices, understanding\\nstudents' perceptions of different feedback providers becomes crucial for\\neffective implementation. This study addresses a critical gap by comparing\\nundergraduate students' trust in AI-generated, human-created, and human-AI\\nco-produced feedback, informing how institutions can adapt feedback practices\\nin this new era. Through a within-subject experiment with 91 participants, we\\ninvestigated factors predicting students' ability to distinguish between\\nfeedback types, perception of feedback quality, and potential biases to AI\\ninvolvement. Findings revealed that students generally preferred AI and\\nco-produced feedback over human feedback in terms of perceived usefulness and\\nobjectivity. Only AI feedback suffered a decline in perceived genuineness when\\nfeedback sources were revealed, while co-produced feedback maintained its\\npositive perception. Educational AI experience improved students' ability to\\nidentify AI feedback and increased their trust in all feedback types, while\\ngeneral AI experience decreased perceived usefulness and credibility. Male\\nstudents consistently rated all feedback types as less valuable than their\\nfemale and non-binary counterparts. These insights inform evidence-based\\nguidelines for integrating AI into higher education feedback systems while\\naddressing trust concerns and fostering AI literacy among students.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T08:06:36Z\"}"}
