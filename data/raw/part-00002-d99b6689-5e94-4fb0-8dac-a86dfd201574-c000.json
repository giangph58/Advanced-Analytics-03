{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21846v1\", \"title\": \"Active Light Modulation to Counter Manipulation of Speech Visual Content\", \"summary\": \"High-profile speech videos are prime targets for falsification, owing to\\ntheir accessibility and influence. This work proposes Spotlight, a low-overhead\\nand unobtrusive system for protecting live speech videos from visual\\nfalsification of speaker identity and lip and facial motion. Unlike predominant\\nfalsification detection methods operating in the digital domain, Spotlight\\ncreates dynamic physical signatures at the event site and embeds them into all\\nvideo recordings via imperceptible modulated light. These physical signatures\\nencode semantically-meaningful features unique to the speech event, including\\nthe speaker's identity and facial motion, and are cryptographically-secured to\\nprevent spoofing. The signatures can be extracted from any video downstream and\\nvalidated against the portrayed speech content to check its integrity. Key\\nelements of Spotlight include (1) a framework for generating extremely compact\\n(i.e., 150-bit), pose-invariant speech video features, based on\\nlocality-sensitive hashing; and (2) an optical modulation scheme that embeds\\n>200 bps into video while remaining imperceptible both in video and live.\\nPrototype experiments on extensive video datasets show Spotlight achieves AUCs\\n$\\\\geq$ 0.99 and an overall true positive rate of 100% in detecting falsified\\nvideos. Further, Spotlight is highly robust across recording conditions, video\\npost-processing techniques, and white-box adversarial attacks on its video\\nfeature extraction methodologies.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI,cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:55:24Z\"}"}
