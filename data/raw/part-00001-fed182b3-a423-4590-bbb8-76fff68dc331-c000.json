{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11756v1\", \"title\": \"AQETuner: Reliable Query-level Configuration Tuning for Analytical Query\\n  Engines\", \"summary\": \"Modern analytical query engines (AQEs) are essential for large-scale data\\nanalysis and processing. These systems usually provide numerous query-level\\ntunable knobs that significantly affect individual query performance. While\\nseveral studies have explored automatic DBMS configuration tuning, they have\\nseveral limitations to handle query-level tuning. Firstly, they fail to capture\\nhow knobs influence query plans, which directly affect query performance.\\nSecondly, they overlook query failures during the tuning processing, resulting\\nin low tuning efficiency. Thirdly, they struggle with cold-start problems for\\nnew queries, leading to prolonged tuning time. To address these challenges, we\\npropose AQETuner, a novel Bayesian Optimization-based system tailored for\\nreliable query-level knob tuning in AQEs. AQETuner first applies the attention\\nmechanisms to jointly encode the knobs and plan query, effectively identifying\\nthe impact of knobs on plan nodes. Then, AQETuner employs a dual-task Neural\\nProcess to predict both query performance and failures, leveraging their\\ninteractions to guide the tuning process. Furthermore, AQETuner utilizes\\nParticle Swarm Optimization to efficiently generate high-quality samples in\\nparallel during the initial tuning stage for the new queries. Experimental\\nresults show that AQETuner significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing\\nquery latency by up to 23.7% and query failures by up to 51.2%.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DB\", \"categories\": \"cs.DB\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T04:18:25Z\"}"}
