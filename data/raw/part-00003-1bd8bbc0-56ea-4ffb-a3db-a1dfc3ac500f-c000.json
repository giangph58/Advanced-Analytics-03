{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04092v1\", \"title\": \"On the boundary polynomial of a graph\", \"summary\": \"In this work, we introduce the boundary polynomial of a graph $G$ as the\\nordinary generating function in two variables $B(G;x,y):=\\n\\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{S\\\\subseteq V(G)} x^{|B(S)|}y^{|S|}$, where $B(S)$ denotes\\nthe outer boundary of $S$. We investigate this graph polynomial obtaining some\\nalgebraic properties of the polynomial. We found that some parameters of $G$\\nare algebraically encoded in $B(G;x,y)$, \\\\emph{e.g.}, domination number, Roman\\ndomination number, vertex connectivity, and differential of the graph $G$.\\nFurthermore, we compute the boundary polynomial for some classic families of\\ngraphs. We also establish some relationships between $B(G;x,y)$ and\\n$B(G^\\\\prime;x,y)$ for the graphs $G^\\\\prime$ obtained by removing, adding, and\\nsubdividing an edge from $G$. In addition, we prove that a graph $G$ has an\\nisolated vertex if and only if its boundary polynomial has a factor ($y+1$).\\nFinally, we show that the classes of complete, complete without one edge,\\nempty, path, cycle, wheel, star, double-star graphs, and many others are\\ncharacterized by the boundary polynomial.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T03:14:45Z\"}"}
