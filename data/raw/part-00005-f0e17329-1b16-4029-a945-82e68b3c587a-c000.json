To leverage benefits like\\nmissing value imputation, labeling, and enrichment with context-aware\\nattributes, LLM-generated data needs a critical validation process. The number\\nof pioneering approaches is increasing fast, opening a promising validation\\nspace that, so far, remains unstructured. We present a design space for the\\ncritical validation of LLM-generated tabular data with two dimensions: First,\\nthe Analysis Granularity dimension: from within-attribute (single-item and\\nmulti-item) to across-attribute perspectives (1 x 1, 1 x m, and n x n). Second,\\nthe Data Source dimension: differentiating between LLM-generated values, ground\\ntruth values, explanations, and their combinations. We discuss analysis tasks\\nfor each dimension cross-cut, map 19 existing validation approaches, and\\ndiscuss the characteristics of two approaches in detail, demonstrating\\ndescriptive power.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T15:01:23Z\"}"}
