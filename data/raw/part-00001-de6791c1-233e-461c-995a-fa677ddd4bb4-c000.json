{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10876v1\", \"title\": \"Non-Minimal RT Coupling and its Impact on Inflationary Evolution in f(R,\\n  T) Gravity\", \"summary\": \"We examine inflationary models in the $f(R, T)$ gravity framework where we\\nhave a conformal constant and an $RT$-mixing term apart from an R term. The\\nRT-mixing term introduces non-minimal coupling between gravity and matter. We\\nconsider the exponential SUSY potential $V(\\\\p)=M^4 \\\\lt(1-e^{-\\\\l \\\\p/\\\\mp}\\\\rt)$\\nand a novel potential $V(\\\\p)=\\\\l \\\\mp^{4-2\\\\a} \\\\p^{2\\\\a} \\\\sin^2\\\\lt(\\\\frac{\\\\b\\n\\\\mp^\\\\a}{\\\\p^\\\\a}\\\\rt)$. With the help of COBE normalization, we constrain values\\nof different parameters and extract the field value at the time of Hubble\\ncrossing. The end of inflation is marked by $\\\\tep(\\\\p_i)=1$ where $\\\\p_i$ is the\\nfield value at the end of inflation. Equipped with these values, we then move\\non to calculate values of spectral index $n_s$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$.\\nOur predicted values of $n_s$ and $r$ fall within their observed values from\\nthe Planck 2018 survey and BICEP/Keck array measurement for both potential,\\nmaking them plausible candidates for the inflationary model. We also display\\nthe variation of the tensor-to-scalar ratio and spectral index with the\\ncoefficient of RT-mixing term for fixed values of e-fold number. There, we find\\nthe existence of two local maxima of $n_s$, which occur at a negative and a\\npositive value of $\\\\x$, the coefficient of $RT$-mixing term. Our analysis finds\\na significant impact of $\\\\x$ on values of observables\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T05:09:10Z\"}"}
