{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04195v1\", \"title\": \"AutoPatch: Multi-Agent Framework for Patching Real-World CVE\\n  Vulnerabilities\", \"summary\": \"Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools in software\\ndevelopment, enabling automated code generation and analysis. However, their\\nknowledge is limited to a fixed cutoff date, making them prone to generating\\ncode vulnerable to newly disclosed CVEs. Frequent fine-tuning with new CVE sets\\nis costly, and existing LLM-based approaches focus on oversimplified CWE\\nexamples and require providing explicit bug locations to LLMs, limiting their\\nability to patch complex real-world vulnerabilities. To address these\\nlimitations, we propose AutoPatch, a multi-agent framework designed to patch\\nvulnerable LLM-generated code, particularly those introduced after the LLMs'\\nknowledge cutoff. AutoPatch integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\\nwith a structured database of recently disclosed vulnerabilities, comprising\\n525 code snippets derived from 75 high-severity CVEs across real-world systems\\nsuch as the Linux kernel and Chrome. AutoPatch combines semantic and taint\\nanalysis to identify the most relevant CVE and leverages enhanced\\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to construct enriched prompts for verification\\nand patching. Our unified similarity model, which selects the most relevant\\nvulnerabilities, achieves 90.4 percent accuracy in CVE matching. AutoPatch\\nattains 89.5 percent F1-score for vulnerability verification and 95.0 percent\\naccuracy in patching, while being over 50x more cost-efficient than traditional\\nfine-tuning approaches.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T07:49:05Z\"}"}
