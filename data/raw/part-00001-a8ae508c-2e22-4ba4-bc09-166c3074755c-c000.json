{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13043v1\", \"title\": \"Machine Learning Decoding of Circuit-Level Noise for Bivariate Bicycle\\n  Codes\", \"summary\": \"Fault-tolerant quantum computers will depend crucially on the performance of\\nthe classical decoding algorithm which takes in the results of measurements and\\noutputs corrections to the errors inferred to have occurred. Machine learning\\nmodels have shown great promise as decoders for the surface code; however, this\\npromise has not yet been substantiated for the more challenging task of\\ndecoding quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes. In this paper, we\\npresent a recurrent, transformer-based neural network designed to decode\\ncircuit-level noise on Bivariate Bicycle (BB) codes, introduced recently by\\nBravyi et al (Nature 627, 778-782, 2024). For the $[[72,12,6]]$ BB code, at a\\nphysical error rate of $p=0.1\\\\%$, our model achieves a logical error rate\\nalmost $5$ times lower than belief propagation with ordered statistics decoding\\n(BP-OSD). Moreover, while BP-OSD has a wide distribution of runtimes with\\nsignificant outliers, our model has a consistent runtime and is an\\norder-of-magnitude faster than the worst-case times from a benchmark BP-OSD\\nimplementation. On the $[[144,12,12]]$ BB code, our model obtains worse logical\\nerror rates but maintains the speed advantage. These results demonstrate that\\nmachine learning decoders can out-perform conventional decoders on QLDPC codes,\\nin regimes of current interest.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T15:57:16Z\"}"}
