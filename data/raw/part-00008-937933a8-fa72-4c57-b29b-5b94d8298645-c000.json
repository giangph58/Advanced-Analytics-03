This framework is based on a novel class of Bayesian clustering\\nfactor models. These models assume a factor model structure where the vectors\\nof common factors follow a mixture of Gaussian distributions. We develop a\\nGibbs sampler to explore the posterior distribution and propose an information\\ncriterion to select the number of clusters and the number of factors.\\nSimulation studies show that our inferential approach appropriately quantifies\\nuncertainty. In addition, when compared to a previously published competitor\\nmethod, our information criterion has favorable performance in terms of correct\\nselection of number of clusters and number of factors. Finally, we illustrate\\nthe capabilities of our framework with an application to data on recovery from\\nopioid use disorder where clustering of individuals may facilitate personalized\\nhealth care.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:26:08Z\"}"}
