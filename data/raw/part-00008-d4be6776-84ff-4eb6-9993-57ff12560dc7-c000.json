{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00553v1\", \"title\": \"The Jackknife method as a new approach to validate strong lens mass\\n  models\", \"summary\": \"The accuracy of a mass model in the strong lensing analysis is crucial for\\nunbiased predictions of physical quantities such as magnifications and time\\ndelays. While the mass model is optimized by changing parameters of the mass\\nmodel to match predicted positions of multiple images with observations,\\npositional uncertainties of multiple images often need to be boosted to take\\naccount of the complex structure of dark matter in lens objects, making the\\ninterpretation of the chi-square value difficult. We introduce the Jackknife\\nmethod as a new method to validate strong lens mass models, specifically\\nfocusing on cluster-scale mass modeling. In this approach, we remove multiple\\nimages of a source from the fitting and optimize the mass model using multiple\\nimages of the remaining sources. We then calculate the multiple images of the\\nremoved source and quantitatively evaluate how well they match the observed\\npositions. We find that the Jackknife method performs effectively in\\nsimulations using a simple model. We also demonstrate our method with mass\\nmodeling of the galaxy cluster MACS J0647.7+7015. We discuss the potential of\\nusing the Jackknife method to validate the error estimation of the physical\\nquantities by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T14:28:50Z\"}"}
