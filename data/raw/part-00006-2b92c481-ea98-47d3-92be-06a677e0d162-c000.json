However,\\nthe current model relies on a small number of Certificate Authorities (CAs) to\\nprovide and validate certificates, thus creating a highly centralized\\necosystem. In this paper, we analyze the degree of centralization of\\ncertificate provisioning from CAs in two major political groups: Brazil,\\nRussia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) and the European Union (EU). We\\nhave found that over 75\\\\% of certificates for both BRICS and EU domains\\noriginate from CAs based in the United States, indicating possible risks to\\ntheir digital sovereignty due to the high level of external dependency. This\\nindicates the need for nations within those groups to research alternatives to\\nreduce the high level of dependency on foreign CAs and increase their digital\\nautonomy.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T17:26:18Z\"}"}
