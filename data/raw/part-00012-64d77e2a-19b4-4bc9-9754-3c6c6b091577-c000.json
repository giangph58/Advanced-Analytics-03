In this work we present ScanEdit, an instruction-driven method\\nfor functional editing of complex, real-world 3D scans. To model large and\\ninterdependent sets of ob- jectswe propose a hierarchically-guided approach.\\nGiven a 3D scan decomposed into its object instances, we first construct a\\nhierarchical scene graph representation to enable effective, tractable editing.\\nWe then leverage reason- ing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and\\ntranslate high-level language instructions into actionable commands applied\\nhierarchically to the scene graph. Fi- nally, ScanEdit integrates LLM-based\\nguidance with ex- plicit physical constraints and generates realistic scenes\\nwhere object arrangements obey both physics and common sense. In our extensive\\nexperimental evaluation ScanEdit outperforms state of the art and demonstrates\\nexcellent re- sults for a variety of real-world scenes and input instruc-\\ntions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T12:12:43Z\"}"}
