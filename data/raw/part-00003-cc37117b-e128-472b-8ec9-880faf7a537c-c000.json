{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19978v1\", \"title\": \"On one generalization of stable allocations in a two-sided market\", \"summary\": \"In the stable allocation problem on a two-sided market introduced and studied\\nby Baiou and Balinski in the early 2000's, one is given a bipartite graph\\n$G=(V,E)$ with capacities $b$ on the edges (``contracts'') and quotas $q$ on\\nthe vertices (``agents''). Each vertex $v\\\\in V$ is endowed with a linear order\\non the set $E_v$ of edges incident to $v$, which generates preference relations\\namong functions (``contract intensities'') on $E_v$, giving rise to a model of\\n\\\\it{stable allocations} for $G$. This is a special case of Alkan-Gale's\\nstability model for a bipartite graph with edge capacities in which, instead of\\nlinear orders, the preferences of each ``agent'' $v$ are given via a choice\\nfunction that acts on the box $\\\\{z\\\\in{\\\\mathbb R}_+^{E_v}\\\\colon z(e)\\\\le b(e),\\\\,\\ne\\\\in E_v\\\\}$ or a closed subset in it and obeys the (well motivated) axioms of\\nconsistence, substitutability and cardinal monotonicity. By central results in\\nAlkan-Gale's theory, the set of stable assignments generated by such choice\\nfunctions is nonempty and forms a distributive lattice.\\n  In this paper, being in frameworks of Alkan-Gale's model and generalizing the\\nstable allocation one, we consider the situation when the preferences of\\n``agents'' of one side (``workers'') are given via linear orders, whereas the\\nones of the other side (``firms'') via integer-valued choice functions subject\\nto the three axioms as above, thus introducing the model of \\\\it{generalized\\nallocations}, or g-allocations for short. Our main aims are to characterize and\\nefficiently construct rotations, functions on $E$ associated with immediately\\npreceding relations in the lattice $(S,\\\\prec)$ of stable g-allocations, and to\\nestimate the complexity of constructing a poset generated by rotations for\\nwhich the lattice of closed functions is isomorphic to $(S,\\\\prec)$, obtaining a\\n``compact'' representation of the latter.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:50:16Z\"}"}
