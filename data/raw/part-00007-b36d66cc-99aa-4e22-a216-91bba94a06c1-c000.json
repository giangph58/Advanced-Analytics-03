This study introduces a novel conceptual\\nframework integrating Generative Artificial Intelligence and Learning Analytics\\nto cultivate Self-Directed Growth, a dynamic competency that enables learners\\nto iteratively drive their own developmental pathways across diverse\\ncontexts.Building upon critical gaps in current research on Self Directed\\nLearning and AI-mediated education, the proposed Aspire to Potentials for\\nLearners (A2PL) model reconceptualizes the interplay of learner aspirations,\\ncomplex thinking, and summative self-assessment within GAI supported\\nenvironments.Methodological implications for future intervention design and\\nlearning analytics applications are discussed, positioning Self-Directed Growth\\nas a pivotal axis for developing equitable, adaptive, and sustainable learning\\nsystems in the digital era.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T15:19:48Z\"}"}
