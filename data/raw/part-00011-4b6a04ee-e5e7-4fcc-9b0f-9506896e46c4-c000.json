Many of these planets will have\\nshort orbital periods and are thus susceptible to tidal decay. We use a catalog\\nof simulated transiting planet detections to predict the yield of orbital decay\\ndetections in the Roman GBTDS. Assuming a constant stellar tidal dissipation\\nfactor, Q^{'}_{*}, of 10^6, we predict ~ 5 - 10 detections. We additionally\\nconsider an empirical period-dependent parameterization of Q^{'}_{*} \\\\propto\\nP^{-3} and find a substantially suppressed yield. We conclude that Roman will\\nprovide constraints on the rate of planet engulfment in the Galaxy and probe\\nthe physics of tidal dissipation in stars.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T17:59:12Z\"}"}
