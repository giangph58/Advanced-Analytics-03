However,\\nretrieving these facts demands time for data search and challenges the\\ncreator's analytical skills. In this work, we introduce DataScout, an\\ninteractive system that automatically performs reasoning and stance-based data\\nfacts retrieval to augment the user's statement. Particularly, DataScout\\nleverages an LLM-based agent to construct a retrieval tree, enabling\\ncollaborative control of its expansion between users and the agent. The\\ninterface visualizes the retrieval tree as a mind map that eases users to\\nintuitively steer the retrieval direction and effectively engage in reasoning\\nand analysis. We evaluate the proposed system through case studies and in-depth\\nexpert interviews. Our evaluation demonstrates that DataScout can effectively\\nretrieve multifaceted data facts from different stances, helping users verify\\ntheir statements and enhance the credibility of their stories.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T07:52:09Z\"}"}
