{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19710v1\", \"title\": \"PhyloProfile v2 -- Exploring multi-layered phylogenetic profiles at\\n  scale\", \"summary\": \"Phylogenetic profiles visualize the presence-absence pattern of genes across\\ntaxa and are essential for delineating the evolutionary fate of genes and gene\\nfamilies. Integrating phylogenetic profiles across many genes and taxa reveals\\npatterns of coevolution, aiding the predictions of gene functions and\\ninteractions. The surge of genome sequences generated by biodiversity genomics\\nprojects allows to compile phylogenetic profiles at an unprecedented scale.\\nPhyloProfile v2 was designed to cope with the novel challenges of visualizing\\nand analyzing phylogenetic profiles comprising millions of pairwise orthology\\nrelationships. By providing the ability to interact with the visualization and\\ndynamically filter the data, PhyloProfile v2 facilitates a seamless transition\\nfrom survey analyses across thousands of genes and taxa down to the feature\\narchitecture comparison of two ortholog pairs within the same analysis. As one\\nkey innovation, PhyloProfile v2 allows the display of phylogenetic profiles in\\n2D or 3D using dimensionality reduction techniques. This novel perspective\\neases, for example, the identification of taxa with similar presence/absence\\npatterns of genes irrespective of their phylogenetic relationships.\\nPhyloProfile v2 is available as an R package at Bioconductor\\nhttps://doi.org/doi:10.18129/B9.bioc.PhyloProfile.
