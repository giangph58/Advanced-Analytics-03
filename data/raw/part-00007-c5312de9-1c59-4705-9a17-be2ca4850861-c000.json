In this paper, we generalize\\nthis characterization to free boundary minimal submanifolds of higher dimension\\nin the same spaces. We also introduce some functionals of the form different\\nfrom $\\\\Theta_{r,i}$ and show that the critical metrics for them are the metrics\\ninduced by free boundary minimal immersions into a geodesic ball in the upper\\nunit hemisphere. In the case of surfaces, these functionals are bounded from\\nabove and not bounded from below. Moreover, the canonical metric on a geodesic\\ndisk in a 3-ball in the upper unit hemisphere is maximal for this functional on\\nthe set of all Riemannian metric of the topological disk.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T15:02:34Z\"}"}
