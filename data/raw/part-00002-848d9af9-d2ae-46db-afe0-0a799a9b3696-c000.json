First, we characterize the laws\\non these planar maps that satisfy both the Markov property and rerooting\\ninvariance, showing that they are Boltzmann-type maps. Second, we provide a\\ncomprehensive characterization of random submaps, that we call stopping maps,\\nsatisfying the Markov property, demonstrating that they are not restricted to\\nthose obtained through a peeling procedure. Third, we introduce decorated\\nmetric planar maps in which edges are replaced by copies of random length\\nintervals $[0,w_e]$, and the decorations are given by continuous functions on\\nthe edges. We define a probability measure on them that is the analogue of the\\nBoltzmann map and show that it satisfies the Markov property even for sets that\\nhalt exploration mid-edge.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,math-ph,math.CO,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T17:37:43Z\"}"}
