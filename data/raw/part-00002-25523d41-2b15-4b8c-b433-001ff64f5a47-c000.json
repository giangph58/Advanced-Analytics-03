{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13165v1\", \"title\": \"RUKA: Rethinking the Design of Humanoid Hands with Learning\", \"summary\": \"Dexterous manipulation is a fundamental capability for robotic systems, yet\\nprogress has been limited by hardware trade-offs between precision,\\ncompactness, strength, and affordability. Existing control methods impose\\ncompromises on hand designs and applications. However, learning-based\\napproaches present opportunities to rethink these trade-offs, particularly to\\naddress challenges with tendon-driven actuation and low-cost materials. This\\nwork presents RUKA, a tendon-driven humanoid hand that is compact, affordable,\\nand capable. Made from 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf components, RUKA has\\n5 fingers with 15 underactuated degrees of freedom enabling diverse human-like\\ngrasps. Its tendon-driven actuation allows powerful grasping in a compact,\\nhuman-sized form factor. To address control challenges, we learn\\njoint-to-actuator and fingertip-to-actuator models from motion-capture data\\ncollected by the MANUS glove, leveraging the hand's morphological accuracy.\\nExtensive evaluations demonstrate RUKA's superior reachability, durability, and\\nstrength compared to other robotic hands. Teleoperation tasks further showcase\\nRUKA's dexterous movements. The open-source design and assembly instructions of\\nRUKA, code, and data are available at https://ruka-hand.github.io/.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:58:59Z\"}"}
