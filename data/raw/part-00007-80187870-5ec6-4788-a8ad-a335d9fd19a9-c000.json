Firstly, we develop the author's previous\\nwork on the dynamical relationship between determinantal point processes and\\nCAR algebras. Secondly, we present a novel application of the theory of\\nstochastic processes associated with KMS states for CAR algebras and their\\nquasi-free states. Lastly, we propose a unified theory of algebraic\\nconstructions and analysis of stationary processes on point configuration\\nspaces with respect to determinantal point processes. As a byproduct, we\\nestablish an algebraic derivation of a determinantal formula for space-time\\ncorrelations of stochastic processes, and we analyze several limiting behaviors\\nof these processes.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,math-ph,math.MP,math.OA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T13:31:09Z\"}"}
