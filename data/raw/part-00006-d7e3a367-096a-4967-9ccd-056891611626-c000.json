{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15709v1\", \"title\": \"Backreaction in $f(R,G)$ Gravitational Waves\", \"summary\": \"We present a comprehensive analysis of gravitational wave dynamics in\\n$f(R,G)$ modified gravity, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar and $G$ the\\nGauss-Bonnet invariant. By developing a scalar-tensor formulation with two\\nauxiliary fields, we systematically investigate both the propagation and\\nbackreaction of high-frequency gravitational waves in cosmological backgrounds.\\nThe linearized field equations reveal how the Gauss-Bonnet term introduces new\\ncurvature-dependent couplings between tensor and scalar degrees of freedom,\\nleading to modified dispersion relations and distinctive wave propagation\\neffects. On de Sitter backgrounds, we obtain exact decoupled equations for the\\ntensor and scalar modes, demonstrating how the additional $G$-dependence alters\\nboth the effective masses and energy transport mechanisms compared to pure\\n$f(R)$ theories.\\n  Our derivation of the effective energy-momentum tensor extends Isaacson's\\napproach to incorporate the novel scalar field contributions, revealing a\\ncomplex hierarchy of characteristic length scales ($\\\\lambda$, $\\\\ell$, and\\n$\\\\mathcal{L}$) that govern the backreaction dynamics. The resulting formalism\\nsuggests potentially observable signatures in both the propagation (phase\\nshifts, amplitude modulation) and stochastic background of gravitational waves.\\nThese effects could be probed by next-generation detectors, offering new\\nconstraints on the $f(R,G)$ coupling parameters. The theoretical framework\\ndeveloped here provides a foundation for future studies of gravitational wave\\ngeneration in modified gravity scenarios and their role in cosmological\\nstructure formation.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T08:50:52Z\"}"}
