Genie uses CPU-initiated traffic over a\\nhardware testbed to emulate GPU to GPU communication, and adapts the ASTRA-sim\\nsimulator to model interaction between the network and the ML workload.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI,cs.AI,cs.DC,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T15:23:55Z\"}"}
