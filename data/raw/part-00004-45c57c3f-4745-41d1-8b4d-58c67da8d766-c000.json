{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11871v1\", \"title\": \"Channel-Adaptive Robust Resource Allocation for Highly Reliable\\n  IRS-Assisted V2X Communications\", \"summary\": \"This paper addresses the challenges of resource allocation in vehicular\\nnetworks enhanced by Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS), considering the\\nuncertain Channel State Information (CSI) typical of vehicular environments due\\nto the Doppler shift. Leveraging the 3GPP's Mode 1 cellular V2X architecture,\\nour system model facilitates efficient subcarrier usage and interference\\nreduction through coordinated V2I and V2V communications. Each Cellular User\\nEquipment (CUE) shares its spectrum with at most one Vehicular User Equipment\\n(VUE) in a one-to-one reuse pattern. We formulate a joint optimization problem\\nfor vehicular transmit power, Multi-User Detection (MUD) matrices, V2V link\\nspectrum reuse, and IRS reflection coefficients in IRS-aided V2X communication\\nwith imperfect CSI. To tackle this, a novel robust resource allocation\\nalgorithm is developed by first decomposing the problem into manageable\\nsub-problems such as power allocation, MUD matrices optimization and IRS phase\\nshifts, and then using the Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) method to alternately\\noptimize these subproblems for optimal resource allocation. Our contributions\\ninclude efficient approaches for self-learning based power allocation and phase\\nshift optimization that adapt to CSI uncertainties, significantly enhancing the\\nreliability and efficiency of vehicular communications. Simulation results\\nvalidate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions in improving the Quality\\nof Service (QoS) and managing the complex interference inherent in dense\\nvehicular networks.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T08:48:53Z\"}"}
