By superimposing multiple payload symbols, Super-LoRa\\nsignificantly increases the data rate while maintaining lower transmitter and\\nreceiver complexity. Our solution is evaluated through both simulations and\\nreal-world experiments, showing a potential throughput improvement of up to 5x\\ncompared to standard LoRa. This advancement positions Super-LoRa as a viable\\nsolution for data-intensive IoT applications such as smart cities and precision\\nagriculture, which demand higher data transmission rates.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T10:02:38Z\"}"}
