{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11091v1\", \"title\": \"AI-guided Antibiotic Discovery Pipeline from Target Selection to\\n  Compound Identification\", \"summary\": \"Antibiotic resistance presents a growing global health crisis, demanding new\\ntherapeutic strategies that target novel bacterial mechanisms. Recent advances\\nin protein structure prediction and machine learning-driven molecule generation\\noffer a promising opportunity to accelerate drug discovery. However, practical\\nguidance on selecting and integrating these models into real-world pipelines\\nremains limited. In this study, we develop an end-to-end, artificial\\nintelligence-guided antibiotic discovery pipeline that spans target\\nidentification to compound realization. We leverage structure-based clustering\\nacross predicted proteomes of multiple pathogens to identify conserved,\\nessential, and non-human-homologous targets. We then systematically evaluate\\nsix leading 3D-structure-aware generative models$\\\\unicode{x2014}$spanning\\ndiffusion, autoregressive, graph neural network, and language model\\narchitectures$\\\\unicode{x2014}$on their usability, chemical validity, and\\nbiological relevance. Rigorous post-processing filters and commercial analogue\\nsearches reduce over 100 000 generated compounds to a focused, synthesizable\\nset. Our results highlight DeepBlock and TamGen as top performers across\\ndiverse criteria, while also revealing critical trade-offs between model\\ncomplexity, usability, and output quality. This work provides a comparative\\nbenchmark and blueprint for deploying artificial intelligence in early-stage\\nantibiotic development.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.BM\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.BM,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T11:36:27Z\"}"}
