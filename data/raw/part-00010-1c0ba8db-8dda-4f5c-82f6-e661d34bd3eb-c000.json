We present\\nSpatial-R1, a targeted approach involving two key contributions: the curation\\nof SR, a new video spatial reasoning dataset from ScanNet with automatically\\ngenerated QA pairs across seven task types, and the application of\\nTask-Specific Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for fine-tuning. By\\ntraining the Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct model on SR using GRPO, Spatial-R1\\nsignificantly advances performance on the VSI-Bench benchmark, achieving a\\n7.4\\\\% gain over the baseline and outperforming strong contemporary models. This\\nwork validates the effectiveness of specialized data curation and optimization\\ntechniques for improving complex spatial reasoning in video MLLMs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:12:17Z\"}"}
