Given a\\nfinite-dimensional representation $\\\\rho \\\\colon G \\\\to \\\\mathrm{GL}(V)$ and a\\nsubspace $U \\\\leq V$ that generates $V$ as a $G$-module, we define the\\n$G$-additive diameter of $V$ with respect to $U$ as the minimal number of\\ntranslates of $U$ under the representation $\\\\rho$ needed to cover $V$. We\\ndemonstrate that every irreducible representation of\\n$\\\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\\\mathbf{C})$ exhibits optimal additive diameters and establish\\nsharp bounds for the conjugation representation of $\\\\mathrm{SL}_n(\\\\mathbf{C})$\\non its Lie algebra $\\\\mathfrak{sl}_n(\\\\mathbf{C})$. Additionally, we investigate\\nanalogous notions for additive diameters in Lie representations. We provide\\napplications to additive diameters with respect to images of equivariant\\nalgebraic morphisms, linking them to the corresponding $G$-additive diameters\\nof images of their differentials.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RT\", \"categories\": \"math.RT,math.AG,math.GR,math.RA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T09:16:31Z\"}"}
