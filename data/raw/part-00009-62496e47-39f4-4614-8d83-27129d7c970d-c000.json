{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03688v1\", \"title\": \"IndicSQuAD: A Comprehensive Multilingual Question Answering Dataset for\\n  Indic Languages\", \"summary\": \"The rapid progress in question-answering (QA) systems has predominantly\\nbenefited high-resource languages, leaving Indic languages largely\\nunderrepresented despite their vast native speaker base. In this paper, we\\npresent IndicSQuAD, a comprehensive multi-lingual extractive QA dataset\\ncovering nine major Indic languages, systematically derived from the SQuAD\\ndataset. Building on previous work with MahaSQuAD for Marathi, our approach\\nadapts and extends translation techniques to maintain high linguistic fidelity\\nand accurate answer-span alignment across diverse languages. IndicSQuAD\\ncomprises extensive training, validation, and test sets for each language,\\nproviding a robust foundation for model development. We evaluate baseline\\nperformances using language-specific monolingual BERT models and the\\nmultilingual MuRIL-BERT. The results indicate some challenges inherent in\\nlow-resource settings. Moreover, our experiments suggest potential directions\\nfor future work, including expanding to additional languages, developing\\ndomain-specific datasets, and incorporating multimodal data. The dataset and\\nmodels are publicly shared at https://github.com/l3cube-pune/indic-nlp\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T16:42:54Z\"}"}
