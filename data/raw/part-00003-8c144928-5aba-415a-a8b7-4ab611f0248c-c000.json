{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12058v1\", \"title\": \"ProvSQL: A General System for Keeping Track of the Provenance and\\n  Probability of Data\", \"summary\": \"We present the data model, design choices, and performance of ProvSQL, a\\ngeneral and easy-to-deploy provenance tracking and probabilistic database\\nsystem implemented as a PostgreSQL extension. ProvSQL's data and query models\\nclosely reflect that of a large core of SQL, including multiset semantics, the\\nfull relational algebra, and terminal aggregation. A key part of its\\nimplementation relies on generic provenance circuits stored in memory-mapped\\nfiles. We propose benchmarks to measure the overhead of provenance and\\nprobabilistic evaluation and demonstrate its scalability and competitiveness\\nwith respect to other state-of-the-art systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DB\", \"categories\": \"cs.DB,H.2.4\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T13:11:07Z\"}"}
