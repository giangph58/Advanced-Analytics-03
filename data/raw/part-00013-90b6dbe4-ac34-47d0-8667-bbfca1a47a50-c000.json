{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12779v1\", \"title\": \"Crossover in Electronic Specific Heat near Narrow-Sense Type-III Dirac\\n  Cones\", \"summary\": \"Two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions exhibit Dirac cones, which are\\nclassified into three types: type-I, type-II, and type-III. In both type-I and\\ntype-II cones, the energy dispersion is linear in all momentum directions.\\nType-I cones are characterized by a non-overtilted structure, where the Dirac\\npoint serves as a local minimum (maximum) for the upper (lower) band. In\\ncontrast, type-II cones exhibit overtilted dispersions, leading to the\\ncoexistence of electron and hole pockets. At the critical tilt, the linear\\nenergy dispersion vanishes in one momentum direction, corresponding to a\\ntype-III Dirac cone. We further define a special case, termed the\\n\\\"narrow-sense\\\" type-III cone, where not only the linear term but also quadratic\\nand higher-order terms vanish, resulting in a completely flat dispersion along\\none direction. In this work, we numerically investigate the temperature ($T$)\\n-dependence of the electronic specific heat ($C$), as the Dirac cone is\\ncontinuously tilted from type-I to narrow-sense type-III. A model with\\nparticle-hole symmetry is employed to ensure that the chemical potential\\n($\\\\mu$) remains temperature independent. Our results reveal a notable crossover\\nin $C$ near narrow-sense type-III, where $C$ changes from $C \\\\propto T^{2}$\\nbelow the crossover temperature ($T_{\\\\rm co}$) to $C \\\\propto T^{\\\\frac{1}{2}}$\\nabove $T_{\\\\rm co}$. This crossover is attributed to the energy-dependent\\nstructure of the density of states. The present findings suggest a feasible\\napproach for experimentally probing the degree of Dirac cone tilting near the\\nnarrow-sense type-III limit.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T09:23:00Z\"}"}
