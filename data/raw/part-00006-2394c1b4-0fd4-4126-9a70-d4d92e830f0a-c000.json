Answering previous\\nnumerical conjectures in the 90s physics literature, we prove an almost global\\nexistence result for small-amplitude solutions. We first establish the\\nexistence of a linear stability threshold for the Weber number, which\\nrepresents the ratio between the square of the background velocity jump and the\\nsurface tension. Then, we prove that for almost all values of the Weber number\\nbelow this threshold any small solution lives for almost all times, remaining\\nclose to the equilibrium. Our analysis reveals a remarkable stabilization\\nphenomenon: the presence of both non-zero background velocity jump and\\ncapillarity effects enables to prevent nonlinear instability phenomena, despite\\nthe inherently unstable nature of the classical Kelvin-Helmholtz problem. This\\nlong-time existence would not be achievable in a setting where capillarity\\nalone provides linear stabilization, without the richer modulation induced by\\nthe velocity jump. Our proof exploits the Hamiltonian nature of the equations.\\nSpecifically, we employ Hamiltonian Birkhoff normal form techniques for\\nquasi-linear systems together with a general approach for paralinearization of\\nnon-linear singular integral operators. This approach allows us to control\\nresonances and quasi-resonances at arbitrary order, ensuring the desired\\nlong-time stability result.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T16:29:09Z\"}"}
