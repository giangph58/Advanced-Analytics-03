Our method leverages diffusion inversion and timestep-specific\\nnull-text embeddings to preserve the structural integrity of the source image.\\nBy introducing a stage-wise latent injection strategy-shape injection in early\\nsteps and attribute injection in later steps-we enable precise, fine-grained\\nmodifications while maintaining global consistency. Cross-attention with\\nreference latents facilitates semantic alignment between the source and\\nreference. Extensive experiments across expression transfer, texture\\ntransformation, and style infusion demonstrate state-of-the-art performance,\\nconfirming the method's scalability and adaptability to diverse image editing\\nscenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T09:18:16Z\"}"}
