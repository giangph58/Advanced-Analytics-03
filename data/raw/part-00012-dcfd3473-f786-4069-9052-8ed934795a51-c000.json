{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04532v1\", \"title\": \"Integrated equilibrium model for electrified logistics and power systems\", \"summary\": \"This paper proposes an integrated equilibrium model to characterize the\\ncomplex interactions between electrified logistics systems and electric power\\ndelivery systems. The model consists of two major players: an electrified\\nlogistics operator (ELO) and a power system operator (PSO). The ELO aims to\\nmaximize its profit by strategically scheduling and routing its electric\\ndelivery vehicles (e-trucks) for deliveries and charging, in response to the\\nlocational marginal price (LMP) set by the PSO. The routing, delivery, and\\ncharging behaviors of e-trucks are modeled by a perturbed utility Markov\\ndecision process (PU-MDP) while their collective operations are optimized to\\nachieve the ELO's objective by designing rewards in the PU-MDP. On the other\\nhand, PSO optimizes the energy price by considering both the spatiotemporal\\ne-truck charging demand and the base electricity load. The equilibrium of the\\nintegrated system is formulated as a fixed point, proved to exist under mild\\nassumptions, and solved for a case study on the Hawaii network via Anderson's\\nfixed-point acceleration algorithm. Along with these numerical results, this\\npaper provides both theoretical insights and practical guidelines to achieve\\nsustainable and efficient operations in modern electrified logistics and power\\nsystems.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T16:05:15Z\"}"}
