{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02342v1\", \"title\": \"On the twin-width of near-regular graphs\", \"summary\": \"Twin-width is a recently introduced graph parameter based on the repeated\\ncontraction of near-twins. It has shown remarkable utility in algorithmic and\\nstructural graph theory, as well as in finite model theory -- particularly\\nsince first-order model checking is fixed-parameter tractable when a witness\\ncertifying small twin-width is provided. However, the behavior of twin-width in\\nspecific graph classes, particularly cubic graphs, remains poorly understood.\\nWhile cubic graphs are known to have unbounded twin-width, no explicit cubic\\ngraph of twin-width greater than 4 is known.\\n  This paper explores this phenomenon in regular and near-regular graph\\nclasses. We show that extremal graphs of bounded degree and high twin-width are\\nasymmetric, partly explaining their elusiveness. Additionally, we establish\\nbounds for circulant and d-degenerate graphs, and examine strongly regular\\ngraphs, which exhibit similar behavior to cubic graphs. Our results include\\ndetermining the twin-width of Johnson graphs over 2-sets, and cyclic Latin\\nsquare graphs.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T07:20:41Z\"}"}
