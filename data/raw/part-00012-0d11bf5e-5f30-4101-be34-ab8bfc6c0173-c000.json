The PL\\nrelations of CBs are affected by metallicity. Here, we establish PL relations\\nand period--luminosity--metallicity (PLZ) relations in nine bands from optical\\nto mid-infrared ($BP$, $G$, $RP$, $J$, $H$, $K_S$, $W1$, $W2$, $W3$) and in\\nfive Wesenheit bands based on Gaia DR3 parallaxes. The dispersion of PLZ\\nrelations gradually decreases from the optical to mid-infrared bands, with the\\nminimum dispersion of 0.138 mag. We fit the best PL relations for three bands\\n($W1$, $W_{G,BP,RP}$, $W_{W1,BP,RP}$) under different parallax uncertainty\\ncriteria and determine a parallax (after correction) zero point of\\n$zp_\\\\varpi=24\\\\pm4$ $\\\\mu$as. After fixing the parallax zero point, we find that\\nthe total zero errors of the PL and PLZ relation are smallest when the parallax\\nuncertainty is less than 2\\\\%, resulting in a calibrated CB luminosity with an\\naccuracy of 0.33\\\\%, which is more accurate than the classical Cepheids.\\nFurthermore, by examining the absolute magnitude residuals in different\\nmetallicity intervals, we find that the use of a linear metallicity effect is\\nappropriate for CBs with different metallicities. These results indicate that\\nCBs are excellent standard candles.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:36:46Z\"}"}
