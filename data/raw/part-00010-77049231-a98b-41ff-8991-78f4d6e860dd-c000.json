{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19837v1\", \"title\": \"Finite temperature phase diagram of the extended Bose-Hubbard model in\\n  the presence of disorder\", \"summary\": \"We study the finite- and non-zero temperature phase diagram of the Extended\\nBose-Hubbard Model for both pure and disordered systems. Such a system can be\\nexperimentally realized by trapping ultracold Rydberg atoms in optical\\nlattices. By regulating the Rydberg excitation level and the lattice spacing,\\nthe system can be engineered to effectively have (i) only the nearest-neighbor\\ninteraction and (ii) both nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor\\ninteractions. For both of these situations, we construct the mean-field phase\\ndiagrams. It is found that the presence of a non-zero temperature significantly\\nchanges the phase diagram because now there is a competition between quantum\\nand thermal fluctuations. We observe that conventional Mott insulator (MI) or\\ncharge-density-wave (CDW) lobes vanish at higher temperatures. In a pure\\nsystem, they melt into a normal fluid. In contrast, the only insulating phase\\nthat survives at high temperatures in the presence of disorder is a Bose glass.\\nIt is evident that the CDW lobes melt at a lower temperature and the Mott lobes\\nmelt at higher temperatures. These transition temperatures depend on the\\non-site and nearest-neighbor interaction strengths, respectively. It is also\\nfound that, with the addition of disorder, the insulating lobes are destroyed\\nat a relatively lower temperature. The mathematical framework that we present\\nhere is capable of treating long-range interactions, disorder, and finite\\ntemperature simultaneously, and versatile enough so that it can be extended to\\nstudy different forms of disorder or longer-range interactions.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas,cond-mat.stat-mech,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:38:51Z\"}"}
