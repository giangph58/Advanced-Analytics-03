{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02558v1\", \"title\": \"Rip Current Segmentation: A Novel Benchmark and YOLOv8 Baseline Results\", \"summary\": \"Rip currents are the leading cause of fatal accidents and injuries on many\\nbeaches worldwide, emphasizing the importance of automatically detecting these\\nhazardous surface water currents. In this paper, we address a novel task: rip\\ncurrent instance segmentation. We introduce a comprehensive dataset containing\\n$2,466$ images with newly created polygonal annotations for instance\\nsegmentation, used for training and validation. Additionally, we present a\\nnovel dataset comprising $17$ drone videos (comprising about $24K$ frames)\\ncaptured at $30 FPS$, annotated with both polygons for instance segmentation\\nand bounding boxes for object detection, employed for testing purposes. We\\ntrain various versions of YOLOv8 for instance segmentation on static images and\\nassess their performance on the test dataset (videos). The best results were\\nachieved by the YOLOv8-nano model (runnable on a portable device), with an\\nmAP50 of $88.94%$ on the validation dataset and $81.21%$ macro average on the\\ntest dataset. The results provide a baseline for future research in rip current\\nsegmentation. Our work contributes to the existing literature by introducing a\\ndetailed, annotated dataset, and training a deep learning model for instance\\nsegmentation of rip currents. The code, training details and the annotated\\ndataset are made publicly available at https://github.com/Irikos/rip_currents.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T13:14:16Z\"}"}
