{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24367v1\", \"title\": \"The structure and topology of an amorphous metal-organic framework\", \"summary\": \"Amorphous metal-organic frameworks are an important emerging materials class\\nthat combine the attractive physical properties of the amorphous state with the\\nversatility of metal-organic framework (MOF) chemistry. The structures of\\namorphous MOFs have largely been inferred by drawing analogies to crystalline\\npolymorphs and inorganic glasses, but ultimately the validity of such\\nstructural models has been challenging to establish either experimentally or\\ncomputationally. Here we use a unified data-driven approach, combining\\nexperimental scattering data and active machine learning for interatomic\\npotentials, to determine the structure of an amorphous zeolitic imidazolate\\nframework (a-ZIF) -- the canonical amorphous MOF. Our results reveal clear\\ndifferences between the structure of a-ZIF and that of other amorphous\\ntetrahedral networks, allowing us to invalidate the long-standing assumption\\nthat these inorganic and hybrid glasses are topologically equivalent. To this\\nend, we introduce a systematic notation for the network topology of amorphous\\nsolids, building a bridge to the successful use of topology analysis in\\ncrystalline MOFs and to materials informatics. Our work provides insights into\\nthe structure and topology of the archetypal amorphous MOF and opens up new\\navenues for modelling and understanding amorphous framework materials more\\ngenerally.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:46:37Z\"}"}
