Gallium phosphide (GaP) is a\\nwell-established semiconductor with suitable band edge positions that has\\nalready been successfully employed in photoelectrochemical solar cells.\\nHowever, to utilize it as efficiently as possible, a proper understanding of\\nits properties when interfaced with water is required, and this is currently\\nlacking. In this work we use ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to study\\nthe properties of the aqueous interfaces of various GaP non-polar (110) and\\npolar (001) terminations. We calculate their band alignment with respect to the\\nstandard hydrogen electrode potential and investigate their interfacial\\nstructural properties. Based on these properties we assess the capability of\\nthe various terminations to catalyze the reactions associated with water\\nsplitting and propose approaches for improving the performance of GaP for\\napplication in PECs.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T14:41:14Z\"}"}
