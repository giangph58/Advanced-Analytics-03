{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15654v1\", \"title\": \"A Vision-Enabled Prosthetic Hand for Children with Upper Limb\\n  Disabilities\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces a novel AI vision-enabled pediatric prosthetic hand\\ndesigned to assist children aged 10-12 with upper limb disabilities. The\\nprosthesis features an anthropomorphic appearance, multi-articulating\\nfunctionality, and a lightweight design that mimics a natural hand, making it\\nboth accessible and affordable for low-income families. Using 3D printing\\ntechnology and integrating advanced machine vision, sensing, and embedded\\ncomputing, the prosthetic hand offers a low-cost, customizable solution that\\naddresses the limitations of current myoelectric prostheses. A micro camera is\\ninterfaced with a low-power FPGA for real-time object detection and assists\\nwith precise grasping. The onboard DL-based object detection and grasp\\nclassification models achieved accuracies of 96% and 100% respectively. In the\\nforce prediction, the mean absolute error was found to be 0.018. The features\\nof the proposed prosthetic hand can thus be summarized as: a) a wrist-mounted\\nmicro camera for artificial sensing, enabling a wide range of hand-based tasks;\\nb) real-time object detection and distance estimation for precise grasping; and\\nc) ultra-low-power operation that delivers high performance within constrained\\npower and resource limits.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI,cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T07:23:51Z\"}"}
