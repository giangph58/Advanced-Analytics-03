Equivariant\\nmodels of 3D point clouds are able to approximate structure-property relations\\nin a way that is fully consistent with the structure of the rotation group, by\\ncombining intermediate representations that are themselves spherical tensors.\\nThe symmetry constraints however make this approach computationally demanding\\nand cumbersome to implement, which motivates increasingly popular unconstrained\\narchitectures that learn approximate symmetries as part of the training\\nprocess. In this work, we explore a third route to tackle this learning\\nproblem, where equivariant functions are expressed as the product of a scalar\\nfunction of the point cloud coordinates and a small basis of tensors with the\\nappropriate symmetry. We also propose approximations of the general expressions\\nthat, while lacking universal approximation properties, are fast, simple to\\nimplement, and accurate in practical settings.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph,cs.LG,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T16:45:28Z\"}"}
