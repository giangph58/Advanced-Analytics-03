To address the high overhead of cascaded\\nchannel estimation, we propose an improved artificial fish swarm algorithm\\n(AFSA) combined with a feedback-based joint active and passive beam training\\nscheme. In this approach, we consider the interference caused by multipath user\\necho signals on target detection and propose a beamforming design method that\\nbalances both communication and sensing performance. Numerical simulations show\\nthat the proposed AFSA outperforms other optimization algorithms, particularly\\nin its robustness against echo interference under different communication\\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constraints.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T04:06:07Z\"}"}
