A novel\\ncut cell method is used to solve the Navier-Stokes equations in the Boussinesq\\napproximation and the convection-diffusion equation in the fluid layer, as well\\nas the heat equation in the solid phase. To track the interface we use the\\nlevel set method where its evolution is simply governed by an advection\\nequation. An incomplete continuous adjoint problem is then derived by\\nconsidering that the velocity field is a check-pointing variable. The results\\nof the minimization problem with a tracking-type cost-functional show that our\\nadjoint method is well suited to optimize the shapes of the fronts in this\\nconfiguration.\", \"main_category\": \"math-ph\", \"categories\": \"math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T08:26:06Z\"}"}
