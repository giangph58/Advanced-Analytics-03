{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06212v1\", \"title\": \"NNN: Next-Generation Neural Networks for Marketing Mix Modeling\", \"summary\": \"We present NNN, a Transformer-based neural network approach to Marketing Mix\\nModeling (MMM) designed to address key limitations of traditional methods.\\nUnlike conventional MMMs which rely on scalar inputs and parametric decay\\nfunctions, NNN uses rich embeddings to capture both quantitative and\\nqualitative aspects of marketing and organic channels (e.g., search queries, ad\\ncreatives). This, combined with its attention mechanism, enables NNN to model\\ncomplex interactions, capture long-term effects, and potentially improve sales\\nattribution accuracy. We show that L1 regularization permits the use of such\\nexpressive models in typical data-constrained settings. Evaluating NNN on\\nsimulated and real-world data demonstrates its efficacy, particularly through\\nconsiderable improvement in predictive power. Beyond attribution, NNN provides\\nvaluable, complementary insights through model probing, such as evaluating\\nkeyword or creative effectiveness, enhancing model interpretability.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T16:57:11Z\"}"}
