{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12696v1\", \"title\": \"Collaborative Perception Datasets for Autonomous Driving: A Review\", \"summary\": \"Collaborative perception has attracted growing interest from academia and\\nindustry due to its potential to enhance perception accuracy, safety, and\\nrobustness in autonomous driving through multi-agent information fusion. With\\nthe advancement of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication, numerous\\ncollaborative perception datasets have emerged, varying in cooperation\\nparadigms, sensor configurations, data sources, and application scenarios.\\nHowever, the absence of systematic summarization and comparative analysis\\nhinders effective resource utilization and standardization of model evaluation.\\nAs the first comprehensive review focused on collaborative perception datasets,\\nthis work reviews and compares existing resources from a multi-dimensional\\nperspective. We categorize datasets based on cooperation paradigms, examine\\ntheir data sources and scenarios, and analyze sensor modalities and supported\\ntasks. A detailed comparative analysis is conducted across multiple dimensions.\\nWe also outline key challenges and future directions, including dataset\\nscalability, diversity, domain adaptation, standardization, privacy, and the\\nintegration of large language models. To support ongoing research, we provide a\\ncontinuously updated online repository of collaborative perception datasets and\\nrelated literature:\\nhttps://github.com/frankwnb/Collaborative-Perception-Datasets-for-Autonomous-Driving.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T06:49:21Z\"}"}
