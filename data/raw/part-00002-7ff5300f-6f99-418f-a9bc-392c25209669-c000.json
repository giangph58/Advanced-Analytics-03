The\\nEuler $p$-factor of the Fourier coefficient is called the ramified Siegel\\nseries. First we show that the ramified Siegel series attached to each cusp can\\nbe decomposed to $U(p)$-eigenfunctions explicitly, next we give recursion\\nformulas of such $U(p)$-characteristic ramified Siegel series.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T04:48:22Z\"}"}
