{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15003v1\", \"title\": \"NTIRE 2025 Challenge on Short-form UGC Video Quality Assessment and\\n  Enhancement: KwaiSR Dataset and Study\", \"summary\": \"In this work, we build the first benchmark dataset for short-form UGC Image\\nSuper-resolution in the wild, termed KwaiSR, intending to advance the research\\non developing image super-resolution algorithms for short-form UGC platforms.\\nThis dataset is collected from the Kwai Platform, which is composed of two\\nparts, i.e., synthetic and wild parts. Among them, the synthetic dataset,\\nincluding 1,900 image pairs, is produced by simulating the degradation\\nfollowing the distribution of real-world low-quality short-form UGC images,\\naiming to provide the ground truth for training and objective comparison in the\\nvalidation/testing. The wild dataset contains low-quality images collected\\ndirectly from the Kwai Platform, which are filtered using the quality\\nassessment method KVQ from the Kwai Platform. As a result, the KwaiSR dataset\\ncontains 1800 synthetic image pairs and 1900 wild images, which are divided\\ninto training, validation, and testing parts with a ratio of 8:1:1. Based on\\nthe KwaiSR dataset, we organize the NTIRE 2025 challenge on a second short-form\\nUGC Video quality assessment and enhancement, which attracts lots of\\nresearchers to develop the algorithm for it. The results of this competition\\nhave revealed that our KwaiSR dataset is pretty challenging for existing Image\\nSR methods, which is expected to lead to a new direction in the image\\nsuper-resolution field.
