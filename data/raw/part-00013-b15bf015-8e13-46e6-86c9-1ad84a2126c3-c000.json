This hampers the discovery of\\ngeneralizable biomarkers, as models tend to overfit tissue-specific patterns\\nrather than capture survival-relevant signals. To address this, we propose a\\nDomain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) trained on TCGA RNA-seq data to learn\\nrepresentations less biased by tissue and more focused on survival. Identifying\\ntissue-independent genetic profiles is key to revealing core cancer programs.\\nWe assess the DANN using: (1) Standard SHAP, based on the original input space\\nand DANN's mortality classifier; (2) A layer-aware strategy applied to hidden\\nactivations, including an unsupervised manifold from raw activations and a\\nsupervised manifold from mortality-specific SHAP values. Standard SHAP remains\\nconfounded by tissue signals due to biases inherent in its computation. The raw\\nactivation manifold was dominated by high-magnitude activations, which masked\\nsubtle tissue and mortality-related signals. In contrast, the layer-aware SHAP\\nmanifold offers improved low-dimensional representations of both tissue and\\nmortality signals, independent of activation strength, enabling subpopulation\\nstratification and pan-cancer identification of survival-associated genes.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,q-bio.QM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T15:51:39Z\"}"}
