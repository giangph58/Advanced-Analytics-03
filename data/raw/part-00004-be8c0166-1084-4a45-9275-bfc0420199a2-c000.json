Given the practical challenges of\\nobtaining accurate models, Q-function-based policy iteration methods are\\nproposed to seek the Nash equilibrium solution for the cooperative graphical\\ngame and the distributed minmax solution for the non-cooperative graphical\\ngame. To implement these methods online, two reinforcement learning frameworks\\nare developed, an actor-disturber-critic structure for the cooperative\\ngraphical game and an actor-adversary-disturber-critic structure for the\\nnon-cooperative graphical game. The stability of the proposed methods is\\nrigorously analyzed, and simulation results are provided to illustrate the\\neffectiveness of the proposed methods.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T08:22:33Z\"}"}
