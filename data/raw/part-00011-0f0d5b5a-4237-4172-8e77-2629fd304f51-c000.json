The strengths of this\\nmethod are the high discriminator coefficient of optical cavities, and the\\nlow-noise extraction of the stabilisation signal using modulation techniques.\\nIn this Letter we report beyond state-of-the-art performance on both of these\\nfundamentals, unlocking $10^{-19}$ fractional frequency laser stabilisation. We\\nemploy a 68 cm long cavity to realise an optical storage time of 300\\nmicroseconds, achieving ultrahigh frequency discrimination. We develop a simple\\nand robust scheme to actively cancel residual amplitude modulation (RAM) at the\\n$10^{-7}$ level in an annealed-proton-exchanged lithium-niobate waveguide\\nelectro-optic-modulator (EOM).\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T14:02:41Z\"}"}
