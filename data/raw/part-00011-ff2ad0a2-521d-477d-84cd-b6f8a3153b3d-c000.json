{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13147v1\", \"title\": \"Purely gravitational dark matter production in warm inflation\", \"summary\": \"We consider an appealing scenario for the production of purely gravitational\\ndark matter in the background of warm inflation, a mechanism that maintains\\nstable thermal bath during inflation. Through systematic investigation of\\nvarious gravitational production channels, we reveal distinctive features\\ncompared to the standard inflation scenario. Notably, the inflaton annihilation\\nchannel in warm inflation exhibits markedly different thermodynamics from the\\nstandard inflation paradigm, leading to a suppression on the production of\\nsub-inflaton-mass dark matter. For the production channel of inflationary\\nvacuum fluctuations, we find a correlation of $\\\\rho_\\\\chi\\\\propto m_\\\\chi^{5/2}$\\nfor the conformally coupled dark matter, which expands the feasible range of\\ndark matter mass. Our results also indicates that a minimum temperature\\nthreshold of $10^{-6}M_P$ is necessary for warm inflation, which allows\\nadequate dark matter production. With observational constraints, our results\\nprovide stringent limits on the mass range of purely gravitational dark matter\\nwith sufficient density: $10^{-8}-10^{-2}M_P$ for minimal coupling and\\n$10^{-14}-10^{-2}M_P$ for conformal coupling.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:54:40Z\"}"}
