Most theories of dust formation in SNe heavily rely only on SN\\n1987A. In the last two years, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has enabled\\nus to probe the dust evolution in decades-old SNe, such as SN 2004et, SN\\n2005ip, and SN 1980K. In this paper, we present two decades of dust evolution\\nin SN 2005af, combining early-time infrared observations with Spitzer Space\\nTelescope and recent detections by JWST. We have used a chemical kinetic model\\nof dust synthesis in SN ejecta to develop a template of dust evolution in SN\\n2005af. Moreover, using this approach, for the first time, we have separately\\nquantified the dust formed in the pre-explosion wind that survived after the\\nexplosion, and the dust formed in the metal-rich SN ejecta post-explosion. We\\nreport that in SN 2005af, predominantly carbon-rich dust is formed in the\\nejecta, where the total mass of ejecta dust is about 0.02-0.03 Msun, while in\\nthe circumstellar medium the amount of surviving oxygen-rich dust is\\n0.001-0.004 Msun.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T09:28:33Z\"}"}
