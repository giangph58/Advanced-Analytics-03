MCTS is often considered challenging to\\ninterpret due to the complexity of its search trees, but our framework is\\nflexible enough to handle a wide range of free-form post-hoc queries and\\nknowledge-based inquiries centered around MCTS and the Markov Decision Process\\n(MDP) of the application domain. By transforming user queries into logic and\\nvariable statements, our framework ensures that the evidence obtained from the\\nsearch tree remains factually consistent with the underlying environmental\\ndynamics and any constraints in the actual stochastic control process. We\\nevaluate the framework rigorously through quantitative assessments, where it\\ndemonstrates strong performance in terms of accuracy and factual consistency.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T15:40:58Z\"}"}
