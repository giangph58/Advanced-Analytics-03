{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16596v1\", \"title\": \"Learning Weighted Automata over Number Rings, Concretely and\\n  Categorically\", \"summary\": \"We develop a generic reduction procedure for active learning problems. Our\\napproach is inspired by a recent polynomial-time reduction of the exact\\nlearning problem for weighted automata over integers to that for weighted\\nautomata over rationals (Buna-Marginean et al. 2024). Our procedure improves\\nthe efficiency of a category-theoretic automata learning algorithm, and poses\\nnew questions about the complexity of its implementation when instantiated to\\nconcrete categories. As our second main contribution, we address these\\ncomplexity aspects in the concrete setting of learning weighted automata over\\nnumber rings, that is, rings of integers in an algebraic number field. Assuming\\na full representation of a number ring OK, we obtain an exact learning\\nalgorithm of OK-weighted automata that runs in polynomial time in the size of\\nthe target automaton, the logarithm of the length of the longest\\ncounterexample, the degree of the number field, and the logarithm of its\\ndiscriminant. Our algorithm produces an automaton that has at most one more\\nstate than the minimal one, and we prove that doing better requires solving the\\nprincipal ideal problem, for which the best currently known algorithm is in\\nquantum polynomial time.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.FL\", \"categories\": \"cs.FL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T10:25:13Z\"}"}
