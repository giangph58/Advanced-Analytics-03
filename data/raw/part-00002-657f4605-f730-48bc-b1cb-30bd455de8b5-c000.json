{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03265v1\", \"title\": \"Synthline: A Product Line Approach for Synthetic Requirements\\n  Engineering Data Generation using Large Language Models\", \"summary\": \"While modern Requirements Engineering (RE) heavily relies on natural language\\nprocessing and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, their effectiveness is limited\\nby the scarcity of high-quality datasets. This paper introduces Synthline, a\\nProduct Line (PL) approach that leverages Large Language Models to\\nsystematically generate synthetic RE data for classification-based use cases.\\nThrough an empirical evaluation conducted in the context of using ML for the\\nidentification of requirements specification defects, we investigated both the\\ndiversity of the generated data and its utility for training downstream models.\\nOur analysis reveals that while synthetic datasets exhibit less diversity than\\nreal data, they are good enough to serve as viable training resources.\\nMoreover, our evaluation shows that combining synthetic and real data leads to\\nsubstantial performance improvements. Specifically, hybrid approaches achieve\\nup to 85% improvement in precision and a 2x increase in recall compared to\\nmodels trained exclusively on real data. These findings demonstrate the\\npotential of PL-based synthetic data generation to address data scarcity in RE.\\nWe make both our implementation and generated datasets publicly available to\\nsupport reproducibility and advancement in the field.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T07:57:16Z\"}"}
