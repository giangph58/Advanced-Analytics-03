{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19886v1\", \"title\": \"Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone-boson Dark Matter from Three Complex Scalars\", \"summary\": \"This study explores a dark matter model in which a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone\\nboson arises as a viable dark matter candidate from the spontaneous and soft\\nbreaking of global $U(1)$ symmetries and stabilized by a residual\\n$\\\\mathbb{Z}_3$ discrete symmetry. The model introduces three complex scalar\\nfields, singlets under the Standard Model gauge group, and charged under a dark\\n$U(1)_V$ gauge symmetry together with a permutative exchange symmetry among\\nthree scalars. These features naturally suppress the dark matter--nucleon\\nscattering cross section by its Nambu-Goldstone boson nature. In addition to\\nconventional annihilation channels, the $\\\\mathbb{Z}_3$ structure allows\\nsemi-annihilation processes, potentially leading to new phenomenological\\nsignatures. We analyze theoretical and experimental constraints, including\\nrelic abundance, Higgs invisible decays, and perturbative unitarity, and\\nevaluate the elastic scattering cross section for boosted dark matter.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:18:29Z\"}"}
