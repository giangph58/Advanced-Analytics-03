It remains unclear, however, whether transitions\\nbetween the migratory modes require changes in external conditions, or whether\\nthe different modes are coexisting states that emerge from the underlying\\nsignaling network. Using a mass-conserved reaction-diffusion model of small\\nGTPase signaling with F-actin mediated feedback, we uncover a bistable regime\\nwhere a polarized mode of migration coexists with spatiotemporal oscillations.\\nIndeed, experimental observations of D. discoideum show that, upon collision\\nwith a rigid boundary, cells may switch from polarized to disordered motion.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.PS\", \"categories\": \"nlin.PS,q-bio.CB\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T04:31:22Z\"}"}
