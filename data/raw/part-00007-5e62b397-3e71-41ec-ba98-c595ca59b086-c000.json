Investigations on its formation in the\\ninterstellar medium could offer insights into synthetic routes leading to\\nglycine in prebiotic environments. Quantum chemical simulations on glycolamide\\n(NH$_2$C(O)CH$_2$OH) formation on interstellar ice mantles, mimicked by a water\\nice cluster model, are presented. Glycolamide synthesis has been here modeled\\nconsidering a stepwise process: the coupling between formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) and\\nthe radical of formamide (NH$_2$CO$^{\\\\bullet}$) occurs first, forming the\\nglycolamide precursor NH$_2$C(O)CH$_2$O$^{\\\\bullet}$, which is then hydrogenated\\nto give anti-glycolamide. We hypothesize that anti-to-syn interconversion will\\noccur in conjunction with glycolamide desorption from the ice surface. The\\nreaction barrier for NH$_2$C(O)CH$_2$O$^{\\\\bullet}$ formation varies from 9 to\\n26 kJ mol$^{-1}$, depending on surface binding sites. Kinetic studies indicate\\nthat this reaction step is feasible in environments with a $T > 35~\\\\text{K}$,\\nuntil desorption of the reactants. The hydrogenation step leading to\\nanti-glycolamide presents almost no energy barrier due to the easy H atom\\ndiffusion towards the NH$_2$C(O)CH$_2$O$^{\\\\bullet}$ intermediate. However, it\\ncompetes with the extraction of an H atom from the formyl group of\\nNH$_2$C(O)CH$_2$O$^{\\\\bullet}$, which leads to formyl formamide, NH$_2$C(O)CHO,\\nand H$_2$. Nonetheless, according to our results, anti-glycolamide formation is\\npredicted to be the most favored reactive channel.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T08:44:07Z\"}"}
