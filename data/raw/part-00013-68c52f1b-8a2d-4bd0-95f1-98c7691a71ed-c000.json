{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20808v1\", \"title\": \"SoccerDiffusion: Toward Learning End-to-End Humanoid Robot Soccer from\\n  Gameplay Recordings\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces SoccerDiffusion, a transformer-based diffusion model\\ndesigned to learn end-to-end control policies for humanoid robot soccer\\ndirectly from real-world gameplay recordings. Using data collected from RoboCup\\ncompetitions, the model predicts joint command trajectories from multi-modal\\nsensor inputs, including vision, proprioception, and game state. We employ a\\ndistillation technique to enable real-time inference on embedded platforms that\\nreduces the multi-step diffusion process to a single step. Our results\\ndemonstrate the model's ability to replicate complex motion behaviors such as\\nwalking, kicking, and fall recovery both in simulation and on physical robots.\\nAlthough high-level tactical behavior remains limited, this work provides a\\nrobust foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning or preference\\noptimization methods. We release the dataset, pretrained models, and code\\nunder: https://bit-bots.github.io/SoccerDiffusion\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:21:08Z\"}"}
