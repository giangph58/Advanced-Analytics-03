Leveraging this, we establish a relatively simple recipe\\nfor constructing varieties with (mild) rational or Du Bois singularities, some\\nof which is applicable in both zero and nonzero characteristic. Furthermore, we\\nexplore notions of singularities that lie in the same cohomological veins of\\nrational singularities for varieties in characteristic zero, including Bhatt's\\nderived splinters and Kov\\\\'{a}cs' birational derived splinters.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG,math.AC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:40:09Z\"}"}
