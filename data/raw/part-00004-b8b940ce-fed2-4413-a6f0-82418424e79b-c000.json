We identified some known substructures,\\nincluding Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE), Sagittarius Stream (Sgr), LMS-1\\n(Wukong), Thamnos, Metal-Weak Thick Disk (MWTD) and Aleph. Additionally, we\\nidentified an undefined metal-poor group (UDG, with [Fe/H] $<-0.8$ dex)\\nprobably linked to known substructure like Aleph, as well as a high\\n$\\\\alpha$-abundance substructure (HAS) associated with both the Nyx and Nyx-2\\nstreams. Chemical abundance of the HAS supports the argument that Nyx and Nyx-2\\nshare a common origin. We discovered three substructures, which we refer to as\\nnew-substructure candidate-1,2,3 (NSTC-1,2,3). Despite exhibiting disk-like\\ndynamics, these NSTCs demonstrate notably low [Mg/Fe] ($<$ 0.2 dex) and [Al/Fe]\\n($<$ $-0.15$ dex), similar to the properties of dwarf galaxies. Their high\\norbital energy and low [$\\\\alpha$/Fe] indicate the association with recent\\naccretion events.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T09:22:58Z\"}"}
