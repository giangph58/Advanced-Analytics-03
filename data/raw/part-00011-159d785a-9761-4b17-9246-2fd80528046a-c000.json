{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09985v1\", \"title\": \"Collective Superradiance: Estimating the Peak Emission Rate and Time\", \"summary\": \"Determining the peak photon emission time and rate for an ensemble of $N$\\nquantum systems undergoing collective superradiant decay typically requires\\ntracking the time evolution of the density operator, a process with\\ncomputational costs scaling exponentially with $N$. We present compact,\\nanalytic formulas for evaluating the peak emission rate and time for initially\\nfully excited quantum emitter ensembles, valid for any geometric configuration\\nand emitter type. These formulas rely solely on the variance of the eigenvalues\\nof a real symmetric $N \\\\times N$ matrix, which describes collective\\ndissipation. We demonstrate the versatility of these results across various\\nenvironments, including free space, solid-state, and waveguide reservoirs. For\\nlarge $N$ the formulas simplify further to depend on just two parameters:\\naverage nearest-neighbor spacing and emitter number. Finally, we present\\nscaling laws and bounds on the spatial size of emitter ensembles, such that\\nsuperradiance is maintained, independent of emitter number or density.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.quant-gas,physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T08:51:42Z\"}"}
