This process is\\na generalization of various models in econometrics, such as Vasicek model,\\nCox-Ingersoll-Ross, and Black-Scholes, allowing for the presence of several\\nthresholds which determine changes in the dynamics. We study the asymptotic\\nbehavior of maximum-likelihood and quasi-maximum-likelihood estimators of the\\ndrift parameters in the case of continuous time and discrete time observations.\\nWe show that for high frequency observations and infinite horizon the\\nestimators satisfy the same asymptotic normality property as in the case of\\ncontinuous time observations. We also discuss diffusion coefficient estimation.\\nFinally, we apply our estimators to simulated and real data to motivate\\nconsidering (multiple) thresholds.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,math.PR,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:26:10Z\"}"}
