At the same time, the electrodynamic properties of such\\nstructures have been addressed only with numerical simulations. Here, we\\nprovide an exact solution of electromagnetic scattering problem at a partially\\ngated 2DES using the Wiener-Hopf technique. We find that incident p-polarized\\nfield is enhanced in immediate vicinity of gate edge. The edge acts as a\\nplasmonic coupler that launches bidirectional (gated and ungated) plasmons in\\nweakly-dissipative 2DES with impedance of inductive type. Electric fields in\\nthese waves markedly exceeds the incident field, especially in the limit of\\nsmall gate-2DES separation. The amplitude of the ungated wave exceeds that of\\ngated for 2DES reactance above the free-space impedance. Both amplitudes are\\nmaximized for the 2DES reactance of the order of free space impedance timed by\\nthe ratio of free space wavelength and gate-2DES separation.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.other\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.other\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T12:08:43Z\"}"}
