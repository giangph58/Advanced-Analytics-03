{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17472v1\", \"title\": \"Using multiple representations to improve student understanding of\\n  quantum states\", \"summary\": \"One hallmark of expertise in physics is the ability to translate between\\ndifferent representations of knowledge and use the representations that make\\nthe problem-solving process easier. In quantum mechanics, students learn about\\nseveral ways to represent quantum states, e.g., as state vectors in Dirac\\nnotation and as wavefunctions in position and momentum representation. Many\\nadvanced students in upper-level undergraduate and graduate quantum mechanics\\ncourses have difficulty translating state vectors in Dirac notation to\\nwavefunctions in the position or momentum representation and vice versa. They\\nalso struggle when translating the wavefunction between the position and\\nmomentum representations. The research presented here describes the\\ndifficulties that students have with these issues and how research was used as\\na guide in the development, validation, and evaluation of a Quantum Interactive\\nLearning Tutorial (QuILT) to help students develop a functional understanding\\nof these concepts. The QuILT strives to help students with different\\nrepresentations of quantum states as state vectors in Dirac notation and as\\nwavefunctions in position and momentum representation and with translating\\nbetween these representations. We discuss the effectiveness of the QuILT from\\nin-class implementation and evaluation.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ed-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ed-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T12:06:04Z\"}"}
