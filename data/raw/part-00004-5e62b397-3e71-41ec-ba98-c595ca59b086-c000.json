If the\\ncomplexity is less than one, then $X$ is a toric variety. We prove that if the\\ncomplexity is less than two, then $X$ is a Fano type variety. Furthermore, if\\nthe complexity is less than 3/2, then $X$ admits a Calabi--Yau structure\\n$(X,B)$ of complexity one and index at most two, and it admits a finite cover\\n$Y \\\\to X$ of degree at most 2, where $Y$ is a cluster type variety. In\\nparticular, if the complexity is one and the index is one, $(X,B)$ is cluster\\ntype. Finally, we establish a connection with the theory of\\n$\\\\mathbb{T}$-varieties. We prove that a variety of $\\\\mathbb{T}$-complexity one\\nadmits a similar finite cover from a cluster type variety.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T08:40:45Z\"}"}
