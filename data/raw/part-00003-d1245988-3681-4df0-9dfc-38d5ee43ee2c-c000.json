{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05970v1\", \"title\": \"MLPROP -- an open interactive web interface for thermophysical property\\n  prediction with machine learning\", \"summary\": \"Machine learning (ML) enables the development of powerful methods for\\npredicting thermophysical properties with unprecedented scope and accuracy.\\nHowever, technical barriers like cumbersome implementation in established\\nworkflows hinder their application in practice. With MLPROP, we provide an\\ninteractive web interface for directly applying advanced ML methods to predict\\nthermophysical properties without requiring ML expertise, thereby substantially\\nincreasing the accessibility of novel models. MLPROP currently includes models\\nfor predicting the vapor pressure of pure components (GRAPPA), activity\\ncoefficients and vapor-liquid equilibria in binary mixtures (UNIFAC 2.0, mod.\\nUNIFAC 2.0, and HANNA), and a routine to fit NRTL parameters to the model\\npredictions. MLPROP will be continuously updated and extended and is accessible\\nfree of charge via https://ml-prop.mv.rptu.de/. MLPROP removes the barrier to\\nlearning and experimenting with new ML-based methods for predicting\\nthermophysical properties. The source code of all models is available as open\\nsource, which allows integration into existing workflows.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CE\", \"categories\": \"cs.CE,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:28:18Z\"}"}
