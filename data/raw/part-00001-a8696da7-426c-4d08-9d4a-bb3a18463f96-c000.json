{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15274v1\", \"title\": \"Is Dynamical Dark Energy Necessary? DESI BAO and Modified Recombination\", \"summary\": \"Recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) by the Dark Energy\\nSpectroscopic Instrument (DESI) exhibit a mild-to-moderate tension with cosmic\\nmicrowave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernova (SN) observations when\\ninterpreted within a flat $\\\\Lambda$CDM framework. This discrepancy has been\\ncited as evidence for dynamical dark energy (DDE). Given the profound\\nimplications of DDE for fundamental physics, we explore whether the tension can\\ninstead be resolved by modifying the physics of recombination. We find that a\\nphenomenological model of modified recombination can effectively reconcile the\\nBAO and CMB datasets and, unlike DDE, also predicts a higher Hubble constant\\n$H_0$, thereby partially alleviating the Hubble tension. A global fit to BAO,\\nCMB, and calibrated SN data clearly favors modified recombination over DDE,\\nsuggesting that current claims of a DDE detection may be premature.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T17:58:14Z\"}"}
