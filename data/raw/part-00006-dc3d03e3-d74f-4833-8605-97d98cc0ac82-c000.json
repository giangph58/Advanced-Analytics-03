Their\\ncolour-magnitude diagrams show the effects of stellar evolution of\\napproximately coeval objects with the same chemical composition. Furthermore,\\nthe determination of their astrophysical parameters (age, distance, colour\\nexcess and metallicity) together with their spatial distribution provides\\ninformation about the structure and the evolution of the Galaxy itself. Using\\ndata from the \\\\textit{Gaia} DR3 and 2MASS catalogues, we develop methodologies\\nfor characterizing open clusters. Precise membership lists, mean astrometric\\nparameters and radii are obtained. Using photometric data from both data\\nsources, we carried out new age calibrations that rely on morphological indices\\nbased on colour ($\\\\Delta BR$) and magnitude ($\\\\Delta G$) differences between\\nthe red clump and the turnoff for a sample of 34 open clusters with ages\\ncovering the interval $8.3 < \\\\log[t({\\\\rm yr})] < 9.9$. A set of age calibration\\nfunctions based on \\\\textit{Gaia} morphological age indices are determined for\\nthe first time. We demonstrate their accuracy, obtaining a mean residual of\\n0.06 dex in $\\\\log[t(yr)]$. Our results also show that stellar evolution models\\ntend to predict the difference $\\\\Delta G$. However, they typically overestimate\\nthe difference $\\\\Delta BR$ for objects younger than $\\\\log[t({\\\\rm yr})] = 8.8$.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T17:13:23Z\"}"}
