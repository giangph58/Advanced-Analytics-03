{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20764v1\", \"title\": \"Self-assembly and time-dependent control of active and passive triblock\\n  Janus colloids\", \"summary\": \"We perform Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulations to explore the self-assembly of\\na two-dimensional model system of triblock Janus colloids as an example of\\n\\\"patchy\\\" colloids forming complex structures. Previous experiments and\\nsimulation studies have shown that such systems are capable of forming a\\ntwo-dimensional Kagome lattice at room temperatures. However, it is well\\nestablished that the crystallization is strongly hampered by the formation of\\nlong-living metastable aggregates. For this reason, recent studies have\\ninvestigated activity, i.e., self-propulsion of the Janus particles as a\\nmechanism to accelerate the formation of stable Kagome structures [Mallory and\\nCacciuto, JACS 141, 2500-2507 (2019)] at selected state points. Here we extend,\\nfirst, the investigations of active Janus colloids for a broader range of\\ndensities and temperatures. We also characterize in detail the associated\\nnucleation of Kagome clusters, as well as their structure in the steady state.\\nSecond, to make contact to the equilibrium case, we propose a simple activity\\ntime protocol where an initially chosen activity is switched off after a finite\\ntime. With this protocol, we not only find Kagome structures in a much broader\\nrange of densities than in the purely passive case, but also obtain a Kagome\\ncrystallization boundary very close to that proposed in earlier Monte Carlo\\nsimulations.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:44:49Z\"}"}
