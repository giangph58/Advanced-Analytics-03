Conventional threshold-based or\\nheuristic schemes often fail, leading to either sticky or excessive handovers.\\nWe introduce the first cross-layer use of an on-device large language model\\n(LLM): high-level reasoning in the application layer that issues real-time\\nactions executed in the PHY/MAC stack. The LLM addresses two tasks: (i)\\ncontext-aware AP selection, where structured prompts fuse environmental cues\\n(e.g., location, time) to choose the best BSSID; and (ii) dynamic threshold\\nadjustment, where the model adaptively decides when to roam. To satisfy the\\ntight latency and resource budgets of edge hardware, we apply a suite of\\noptimizations-chain-of-thought prompting, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and\\nquantization. Experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets show that our approach\\nsurpasses legacy heuristics and DRL baselines, achieving a strong balance\\nbetween roaming stability and signal quality. These findings underscore the\\npromise of application-layer LLM reasoning for lower-layer wireless control in\\nfuture edge systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.NI,eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T07:04:49Z\"}"}
