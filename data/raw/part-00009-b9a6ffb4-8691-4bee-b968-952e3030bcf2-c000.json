Dusty Rossby Wave Instability\", \"summary\": \"Annular substructures serve as ideal venues for planetesimal formation. In\\nthis series, we investigate the linear stage of dust growth within rings. The\\nfirst paper examines the global streaming instability, while this study focuses\\non the dusty Rossby wave instability (DRWI). We perform a linear analysis of\\nthe two-fluid equations on a background pressure bump, representing annular\\nsubstructures. The spectral code \\\\textsc{Dedalus} is used to solve the linear\\neigenvalue problem. We identify two distinct DRWI modes: Type I, which\\noriginates from dust-modified gas RWI, and Type II, which results from dust-gas\\ncoupling. These modes never coexist for a given azimuthal wavenumber $\\\\ky$, but\\ntransition between each other as $\\\\ky$ varies. Type I modes are driven by the\\nadvection of background vorticity, whereas Type II modes involve two primary\\nwaves: Rossby waves, driven by advection, and thin waves, driven by dust-gas\\ndrag. Finally, we assess the relevance of DRWI in ALMA rings using DSHARP\\nsources. Our findings suggest that Type I modes could explain the absence of\\nazimuthal asymmetries in many ALMA disks, whereas Type II modes are entirely\\nabsent in all eight observed rings, implying that unresolved narrow rings or\\nalternative mechanisms may play a role in dust growth within annular\\nsubstructures.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:01:02Z\"}"}
