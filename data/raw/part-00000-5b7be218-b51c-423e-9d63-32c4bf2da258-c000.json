We frame the task as an\\ninformation retrieval problem, where the document content is used to retrieve\\nsubject tags from a large subject taxonomy. We leverage two types of encoder\\nmodels to build a two-stage information retrieval system -- a bi-encoder for\\ncoarse-grained candidate extraction at the first stage, and a cross-encoder for\\nfine-grained re-ranking at the second stage. This approach proved effective,\\ndemonstrating significant improvements in recall compared to single-stage\\nmethods and showing competitive results according to qualitative evaluation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T11:44:08Z\"}"}
