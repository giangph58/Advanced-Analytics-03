{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05326v1\", \"title\": \"TS-Detector : Detecting Feature Toggle Usage Patterns\", \"summary\": \"Feature toggles enable developers to control feature states, allowing the\\nfeatures to be released to a limited group of users while preserving overall\\nsoftware functionality. The absence of comprehensive best practices for feature\\ntoggle usage often results in improper implementation, causing code quality\\nissues. Although certain feature toggle usage patterns are prone to toggle\\nsmells, there is no tool as of today for software engineers to detect toggle\\nusage patterns from the source code. This paper presents a tool TS-Detector to\\ndetect five different toggle usage patterns across ten open-source software\\nprojects in six different programming languages. We conducted a manual\\nevaluation and results show that the true positive rates of detecting Spread,\\nNested, and Dead toggles are 80%, 86.4%, and 66.6% respectively, and the true\\nnegative rate of Mixed and Enum usages was 100%. The tool can be downloaded\\nfrom its GitHub repository and can be used following the instructions provided\\nthere.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:15:19Z\"}"}
