{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04438v1\", \"title\": \"Do We Still Need to Work on Odometry for Autonomous Driving?\", \"summary\": \"Over the past decades, a tremendous amount of work has addressed the topic of\\nego-motion estimation of moving platforms based on various proprioceptive and\\nexteroceptive sensors. At the cost of ever-increasing computational load and\\nsensor complexity, odometry algorithms have reached impressive levels of\\naccuracy with minimal drift in various conditions. In this paper, we question\\nthe need for more research on odometry for autonomous driving by assessing the\\naccuracy of one of the simplest algorithms: the direct integration of wheel\\nencoder data and yaw rate measurements from a gyroscope. We denote this\\nalgorithm as Odometer-Gyroscope (OG) odometry. This work shows that OG odometry\\ncan outperform current state-of-the-art radar-inertial SE(2) odometry for a\\nfraction of the computational cost in most scenarios. For example, the OG\\nodometry is on top of the Boreas leaderboard with a relative translation error\\nof 0.20%, while the second-best method displays an error of 0.26%.\\nLidar-inertial approaches can provide more accurate estimates, but the\\ncomputational load is three orders of magnitude higher than the OG odometry. To\\nfurther the analysis, we have pushed the limits of the OG odometry by purposely\\nviolating its fundamental no-slip assumption using data collected during a\\nheavy snowstorm with different driving behaviours. Our conclusion shows that a\\nsignificant amount of slippage is required to result in non-satisfactory pose\\nestimates from the OG odometry.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:07:01Z\"}"}
