This article presents a novel End-User\\nDevelopment (EUD) approach for black-box AI models through a redesigned user\\ninterface in the Rhino-Cyt platform, a medical AI-based decision-support system\\nfor medical professionals (more precisely, rhinocytologists) to carry out cell\\nclassification. The proposed interface empowers users to intervene in AI\\ndecision-making process by editing explanations and reconfiguring the model,\\ninfluencing its future predictions. This work contributes to Human-Centered AI\\n(HCAI) and EUD by discussing how explanation-driven interventions allow a blend\\nof explainability, user intervention, and model reconfiguration, fostering a\\nsymbiosis between humans and user-tailored AI systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T08:44:48Z\"}"}
