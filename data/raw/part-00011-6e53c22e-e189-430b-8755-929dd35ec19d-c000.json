In this work, we\\npropose neural network methods for approximating solutions to problems\\ninvolving these operators. Specifically, we focus on computing the power series\\nof non-expansive Perron-Frobenius operators under a given $L^p$-norm with a\\nconstant damping parameter in $(0,1)$. We use PINNs and RVPINNs to approximate\\nsolutions in their strong and variational forms, respectively. We provide a\\npriori error estimates for quasi-minimizers of the associated loss functions.\\nWe present some numerical results for 1D and 2D examples to show the\\nperformance of our methods.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T16:46:52Z\"}"}
