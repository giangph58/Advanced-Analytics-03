{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01941v1\", \"title\": \"End-to-End Driving with Online Trajectory Evaluation via BEV World Model\", \"summary\": \"End-to-end autonomous driving has achieved remarkable progress by integrating\\nperception, prediction, and planning into a fully differentiable framework.\\nYet, to fully realize its potential, an effective online trajectory evaluation\\nis indispensable to ensure safety. By forecasting the future outcomes of a\\ngiven trajectory, trajectory evaluation becomes much more effective. This goal\\ncan be achieved by employing a world model to capture environmental dynamics\\nand predict future states. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end driving\\nframework WoTE, which leverages a BEV World model to predict future BEV states\\nfor Trajectory Evaluation. The proposed BEV world model is latency-efficient\\ncompared to image-level world models and can be seamlessly supervised using\\noff-the-shelf BEV-space traffic simulators. We validate our framework on both\\nthe NAVSIM benchmark and the closed-loop Bench2Drive benchmark based on the\\nCARLA simulator, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
