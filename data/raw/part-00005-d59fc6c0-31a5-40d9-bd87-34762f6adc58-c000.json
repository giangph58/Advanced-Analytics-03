{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14944v1\", \"title\": \"Haloscope Searching for Dark Photons at Q-band with a Novel Coupling\\n  Tuning Structure\", \"summary\": \"Laboratory searching for dark matter is crucial for understanding several\\nfundamental conundrums in physics and cosmology. Most cavity-based haloscope\\nsearches focus on the frequency range below 10 GHz, while the parameter space\\nwith higher frequency remains rarely explored, due to the challenges lying in\\nthe fabrication of microwave cavities. Here we report the first Q-band\\nhaloscope searching for dark photons with a 33.141 GHz cavity. A novel coupling\\ntuning structure separated from the cavity was designed so as not to degrade\\nthe quality factor of the cavity. We have established the most stringent\\nconstraints $\\\\chi<2.5\\\\times10^{-12}$ at a confidence level of 90$\\\\%$ in the\\nfrequency range from 33.139 GHz to 33.143 GHz, corresponding to the mass of\\ndark photons ranging from 137.05 $\\\\mu$eV to 137.07 $\\\\mu$eV. The results surpass\\nthe previous astronomical constraints by nearly three orders of magnitude. This\\nwork has demonstrated the feasibility of dark matter haloscopes at Q band. In\\nthe future, the constraints can be further improved by more than one order of\\nmagnitude through low-temperature experiments, and the setup can be extended to\\nsearch for axions, axion-like particles, and high-frequency gravitational\\nwaves.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T08:08:52Z\"}"}
