In this work, we\\nintroduce SoccerNet-v3D and ISSIA-3D, two enhanced and scalable datasets\\ndesigned for 3D scene understanding in soccer broadcast analysis. These\\ndatasets extend SoccerNet-v3 and ISSIA by incorporating field-line-based camera\\ncalibration and multi-view synchronization, enabling 3D object localization\\nthrough triangulation. We propose a monocular 3D ball localization task built\\nupon the triangulation of ground-truth 2D ball annotations, along with several\\ncalibration and reprojection metrics to assess annotation quality on demand.\\nAdditionally, we present a single-image 3D ball localization method as a\\nbaseline, leveraging camera calibration and ball size priors to estimate the\\nball's position from a monocular viewpoint. To further refine 2D annotations,\\nwe introduce a bounding box optimization technique that ensures alignment with\\nthe 3D scene representation. Our proposed datasets establish new benchmarks for\\n3D soccer scene understanding, enhancing both spatial and temporal analysis in\\nsports analytics. Finally, we provide code to facilitate access to our\\nannotations and the generation pipelines for the datasets.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T11:15:13Z\"}"}
