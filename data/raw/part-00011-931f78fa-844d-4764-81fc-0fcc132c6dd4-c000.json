{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16452v1\", \"title\": \"Photonic single-arm gravitational wave detectors based on the quantum\\n  state transition of orbital angular momentum\", \"summary\": \"We explore the quantum state transition of photon orbital angular momentum\\n(OAM) in the present of gravitational waves (GWs) and demonstrate the potential\\nof a new photonic single-arm GW detection technique. The interaction is\\ncalculated based on the framework of the wave propagation in linearized gravity\\ntheory and canonical quantization of the electromagnetic field in curved\\nspacetime. It is demonstrated that when a photon possessing OAM of 1 interacts\\nwith GWs, it may relinquish its OAM and produce a central signal that may be\\ndetected. The detector provides a high and steady rate of detected photons in\\nthe low-frequency range ($<1$ Hz), opens a potential window to identify GWs in\\nthe mid-frequency range ($1\\\\sim10$ Hz), which is absent in other contemporary\\nGW detectors, and establishes a selection rule for GW frequencies in the\\nhigh-frequency range ($>10$ Hz), allowing for the adjustment of detector\\nparameters to focus on specific GW frequencies. Furthermore, the detector is\\ninsensitive to seismic noise, and the detectable photon count rate is\\nproportional to the square of the GW amplitude, making it more advantageous for\\ndetermining the distance of the source compared to current interferometer\\ndetectors. This technique not only facilitates the extraction of GW information\\nbut also creates a new approach for identifying and selecting GW signals.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.IM,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T06:32:06Z\"}"}
