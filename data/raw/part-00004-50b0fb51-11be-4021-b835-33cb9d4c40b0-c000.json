In this work, we present a novel high-quality annotated dataset and\\ntwo-stage method for the detection, semantic segmentation and mass estimation\\nof post-harvest and post-storage sugar beets in monocular RGB images. We\\nconduct extensive ablation experiments for the detection of sugar beets and\\ntheir fine-grained semantic segmentation regarding damages, rot, soil adhesion\\nand excess vegetation. For these tasks, we evaluate multiple image sizes, model\\narchitectures and encoders, as well as the influence of environmental\\nconditions. Our experiments show an mAP50-95 of 98.8 for sugar-beet detection\\nand an mIoU of 64.0 for the best-performing segmentation model.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T13:14:03Z\"}"}
