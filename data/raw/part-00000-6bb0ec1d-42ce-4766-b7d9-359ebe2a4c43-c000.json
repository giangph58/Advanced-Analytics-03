The case of high-conductivity, moderately correlated materials\\ncharacterized by low scattering rates is particularly challenging, since\\nexquisite numerical precision of the low-energy electronic structure is\\nrequired. Recent methodological advancements to density-functional theory\\ncombined with dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT), including adaptive\\nBrillouin-zone integration and numerically precise self-energies, enable a\\nrigorous investigation of electron-electron scattering in such materials. In\\nparticular, these tools may be leveraged to perform a robust scattering-rate\\nanalysis on both real- and imaginary-frequency axes. Applying this methodology\\nto a subset of ABO$_3$ perovskite oxides -- SrVO$_3$, SrMoO$_3$, PbMoO$_3$, and\\nSrRuO$_3$ -- we demonstrate its ability to qualitatively and quantitatively\\ndescribe electron-electron contributions to the temperature-dependent\\ndirect-current resistivity. This combination of numerical techniques offers\\nfundamental insight into the role of electronic correlations in transport\\nphenomena and provides a predictive tool for identifying materials with\\npotential for technological applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T15:28:08Z\"}"}
