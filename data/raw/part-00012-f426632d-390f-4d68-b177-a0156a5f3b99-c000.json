We have produced fused silica\\nresonators suitable for low frequency inertial sensing and demonstrated that Qs\\nof over 150,000 are possible. One resonator we produced was combined with a\\nhomodyne quadrature interferometer (HoQI) to read out the test mass\\ndisplacement to form an inertial sensor. This is the first time a HoQI was used\\nwith a high Q resonator. The resulting sensor was tested against other\\ncommercial, kilogram scale inertial sensors at the AEI 10\\\\,m Prototype\\nfacility. Despite the dynamic range challenges induced by the test mass motion,\\nwe can match the excellent noise floors HoQIs have achieved so far with\\nslow-moving or stationary test masses, showing HoQIs as an excellent candidate\\nfor the readout of such sensors. We evaluate the setup as an inertial sensor,\\nshowing the best performance demonstrated by any gram-scale sensor to date,\\nwith comparable sensitivity to the significantly bulkier sensors used in\\ngravitational wave detectors today. These sensors' compact size,\\nself-calibration, and vacuum compatibility make them ideal candidates for the\\ninertial sensing requirements in future gravitational wave detectors.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T16:35:33Z\"}"}
