The ongoing R\\\\&D High-Temperature Superconductors (HTS) suggests\\nusing Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8-x}$ (Bi-2212) as superconducting element.\\nBi-2212 Rutherford cables maintain a high critical current (I$_C$) when exposed\\nto a large external magnetic field. However, Bi-2212 exhibits an oversensitive\\nstress-strain response when subject to large Lorentz forces. This paper reports\\non the magnetic and mechanical analysis of the Bi-2212 cosine-theta insert\\nbeing developed at Fermilab for a hybrid magnet composed of two external layers\\nof Nb$_3$Sn and two internal layers of Bi-2212. We performed a FEM analysis of\\nthe insert to estimate the HTS stress state in the coil's strands under\\nmagnetic and mechanical loads.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.acc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.acc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T12:38:37Z\"}"}
