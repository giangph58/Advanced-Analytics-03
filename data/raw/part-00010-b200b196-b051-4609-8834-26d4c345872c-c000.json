{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19750v1\", \"title\": \"Non-stabilizerness generation in a multi-particle quantum walk\", \"summary\": \"We investigate the generation of non-stabilizerness, or magic, in a\\nmulti-particle quantum walk by analyzing the time evolution of the stabilizer\\nR\\\\'enyi entropy $M_2$. Our study considers both single- and two-particle\\nquantum walks in the framework of the XXZ Heisenberg model with varying\\ninteraction strengths. We demonstrate that the spread of magic follows the\\nlight-cone structure dictated by the system's dynamics, with distinct behaviors\\nemerging in the easy-plane ($\\\\Delta < 1$) and easy-axis ($\\\\Delta > 1$) regimes.\\nFor $\\\\Delta < 1$, magic generation is primarily governed by single-particle\\ndynamics, while for $\\\\Delta > 1$, doublon propagation dominates, resulting in a\\nsignificantly slower growth of $M_2$. Furthermore, the magic exhibits\\nlogarithmic growth in time for both one and two-particle dynamics.\\nAdditionally, by examining the Pauli spectrum, we show that the statistical\\ndistribution of level spacings exhibits Poissonian behavior, independent of\\ninteraction strength or particle number. Our results shed light on the role of\\ninteractions on magic generation in a many-body system.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T12:50:34Z\"}"}
