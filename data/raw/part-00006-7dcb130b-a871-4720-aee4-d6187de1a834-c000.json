The consideration is performed both for the case\\nof weak carrier coupling (high density) and strong coupling (low density). It\\nis shown that in the high-density limit, the critical current is proportional\\nto the product of the transparencies of the barriers in the electron and hole\\nlayers, whereas in the low-density limit, the current is inversely proportional\\nto the sum of the heights of the potential barriers.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T16:24:47Z\"}"}
