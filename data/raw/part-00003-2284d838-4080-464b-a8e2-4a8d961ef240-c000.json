{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05107v1\", \"title\": \"Decentralized Semantic Federated Learning for Real-Time Public Safety\\n  Tasks: Challenges, Methods, and Directions\", \"summary\": \"Public safety tasks rely on the collaborative functioning of multiple edge\\ndevices (MEDs) and base stations (BSs) in different regions, consuming\\nsignificant communication energy and computational resources to execute\\ncritical operations like fire monitoring and rescue missions. Traditional\\nfederated edge computing (EC) methods require frequent central communication,\\nconsuming substantial energy and struggling with resource heterogeneity across\\ndevices, networks, and data. To this end, this paper introduces a decentralized\\nsemantic federated learning (DSFL) framework tailored for large-scale wireless\\ncommunication systems and heterogeneous MEDs. The framework incorporates a\\nhierarchical semantic communication (SC) scheme to extend EC coverage and\\nreduce communication overhead. Specifically, the lower layer optimizes intra-BS\\ncommunication through task-specific encoding and selective transmission under\\nconstrained networks, while the upper layer ensures robust inter-BS\\ncommunication via semantic aggregation and distributed consensus across\\ndifferent regions. To further balance communication costs and semantic\\naccuracy, an energy-efficient aggregation scheme is developed for both intra-BS\\nand inter-BS communication. The effectiveness of the DSFL framework is\\ndemonstrated through a case study using the BoWFire dataset, showcasing its\\npotential in real-time fire detection scenarios. Finally, we outlines open\\nissues for edge intelligence and SC in public safety tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:13:50Z\"}"}
