However, accurately modeling their\\nthermal transport properties remains a significant challenge, primarily due to\\nthe computational limitations of density functional theory (DFT) and the\\ninaccuracies of classical force fields in non-equilibrium regimes. To address\\nthis, we use a recently developed hybrid computational framework that combines\\nmachine learning potential (MLP) for intralayer interactions with\\nregistry-dependent interlayer potential (ILP) for anisotropic vdW interlayer\\ninteraction, achieving near quantum mechanical accuracy. This approach\\ndemonstrates exceptional agreement with DFT calculations and experimental data\\nfor TMD systems, accurately predicting key properties such as lattice\\nconstants, bulk modulus, moir\\\\'e reconstruction, phonon spectra, and thermal\\nconductivities. The scalability of this method enables accurate simulations of\\nTMD heterostructures with large-scale moir\\\\'e superlattices, making it a\\ntransformative tool for the design of TMD-based thermal metamaterials and\\ndevices, bridging the gap between accuracy and computational efficiency.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T08:02:12Z\"}"}
