Traditional numeric and polarity-based ratings often fail to\\ncapture the nuanced sentiment embedded in user feedback. We evaluated the\\neffectiveness of CoT prompting versus simple prompting on 2000 Amazon app\\nreviews by comparing each method's predictions to human judgements. CoT\\nprompting improved classification accuracy from 84% to 93% highlighting the\\nbenefit of explicit reasoning in enhancing sentiment analysis performance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T05:13:15Z\"}"}
