For which reason might\\nobservations be inconsistent? This contribution intends to answer both\\nquestions by proposing a novel multi-group Gaussian mixture model that accounts\\nfor the given group context while allowing high flexibility. This is achieved\\nby assuming that the observations of a particular group originate not from a\\nsingle distribution but from a Gaussian mixture of all group distributions.\\nMoreover, the model provides robustness against cellwise outliers, thus against\\natypical data cells of the observations. The objective function can be\\nformulated as a likelihood problem and optimized efficiently. We also derive\\nthe theoretical breakdown point of the estimators, an innovative result in this\\ncontext to quantify the degree of robustness to cellwise outliers. Simulations\\ndemonstrate the excellent performance and the advantages to alternative models\\nand estimators. Applications from different areas illustrate the strength of\\nthe method, particularly in investigating observations which are on the overlap\\nof different groups.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T12:54:21Z\"}"}
