{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15096v1\", \"title\": \"Bisections of graphs under degree constraints\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we investigate the problem of finding {\\\\it bisections} (i.e.,\\nbalanced bipartitions) in graphs. We prove the following two results for {\\\\it\\nall} graphs $G$: (1). $G$ has a bisection where each vertex $v$ has at least\\n$(1/4 - o(1))d_G(v)$ neighbors in its own part; (2). $G$ also has a bisection\\nwhere each vertex $v$ has at least $(1/4 - o(1))d_G(v)$ neighbors in the\\nopposite part. These results are asymptotically optimal up to a factor of\\n$1/2$, aligning with what is expected from random constructions, and provide\\nthe first systematic understanding of bisections in general graphs under degree\\nconstraints. As a consequence, we establish for the first time the existence of\\na function $f(k)$ such that for any $k\\\\geq 1$, every graph with minimum degree\\nat least $f(k)$ admits a bisection where every vertex has at least $k$\\nneighbors in its own part, as well as a bisection where every vertex has at\\nleast $k$ neighbors in the opposite part.\\n  Using a more general setting, we further show that for any $\\\\varepsilon > 0$,\\nthere exist $c_\\\\varepsilon, c'_\\\\varepsilon > 0$ such that any graph $G$ with\\nminimum degree at least $c_\\\\varepsilon k$ (respectively, $c'_\\\\varepsilon k$)\\nadmits a bisection satisfying: every vertex has at least $k$ neighbors in its\\nown part (respectively, in the opposite part), and at least $(1 -\\n\\\\varepsilon)|V(G)|$ vertices have at least $k$ neighbors in the opposite part\\n(respectively, in their own part). These results extend and strengthen\\nclassical graph partitioning theorems of Erd\\\\H{o}s, Thomassen, and\\nK\\\\\\\"{u}hn-Osthus, while additionally satisfying the bisection requirement.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T13:31:27Z\"}"}
