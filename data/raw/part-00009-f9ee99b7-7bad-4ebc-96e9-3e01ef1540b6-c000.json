{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05939v1\", \"title\": \"Collision-free landing of multiple UAVs on moving ground vehicles using\\n  time-varying control barrier functions\", \"summary\": \"In this article, we present a centralized approach for the control of\\nmultiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for landing on moving unmanned ground\\nvehicles (UGVs) using control barrier functions (CBFs). The proposed control\\nframework employs two kinds of CBFs to impose safety constraints on the UAVs'\\nmotion. The first class of CBFs (LCBF) is a three-dimensional exponentially\\ndecaying function centered above the landing platform, designed to safely and\\nprecisely land UAVs on the UGVs. The second set is a spherical CBF (SCBF),\\ndefined between every pair of UAVs, which avoids collisions between them. The\\nLCBF is time-varying and adapts to the motions of the UGVs. In the proposed CBF\\napproach, the control input from the UAV's nominal tracking controller designed\\nto reach the landing platform is filtered to choose a minimally-deviating\\ncontrol input that ensures safety (as defined by the CBFs). As the control\\ninputs of every UAV are shared in establishing multiple CBF constraints, we\\nprove that the control inputs are shared without conflict in rendering the safe\\nsets forward invariant. The performance of the control framework is validated\\nthrough a simulated scenario involving three UAVs landing on three moving\\ntargets.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T11:54:45Z\"}"}
