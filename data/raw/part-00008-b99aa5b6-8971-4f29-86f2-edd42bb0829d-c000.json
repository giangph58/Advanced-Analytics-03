{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16726v1\", \"title\": \"Partial orders and contraction for BISO channels\", \"summary\": \"A fundamental question in information theory is to quantify the loss of\\ninformation under a noisy channel. Partial orders and contraction coefficients\\nare typical tools to that end, however, they are often also challenging to\\nevaluate. For the special class of binary input symmetric output (BISO)\\nchannels, Geng et al. showed that among channels with the same capacity, the\\nbinary symmetric channel (BSC) and binary erasure channel (BEC) are extremal\\nwith respect to the more capable order. Here, we show two main results. First,\\nfor channels with the same KL contraction coefficient, the same holds with\\nrespect to the less noisy order. Second, for channels with the same Dobrushin\\ncoefficient, or equiv. maximum leakage or Doeblin coefficient, the same holds\\nwith respect to the degradability order. In the process, we provide a\\nclosed-form expression for the contraction coefficients of BISO channels. We\\nalso discuss the comparability of BISO channels and extensions to binary\\nchannels in general.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T14:00:36Z\"}"}
