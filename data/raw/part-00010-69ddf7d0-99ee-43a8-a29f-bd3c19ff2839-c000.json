{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03309v1\", \"title\": \"Self-similar algebraic spiral vortex sheets of 2-D incompressible Euler\\n  equations\", \"summary\": \"This paper provides the first rigorous construction of the self-similar\\nalgebraic spiral vortex sheet solutions to the 2-D incompressible Euler\\nequations. These solutions are believed to represent the typical roll-up\\npattern of vortex sheets after the formation of curvature singularities. The\\nmost challenging part of this paper is to handle the Cauchy integral for the\\nalgebraic spiral curve, which falls outside the classical theory of singular\\nintegral operators.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:42:29Z\"}"}
