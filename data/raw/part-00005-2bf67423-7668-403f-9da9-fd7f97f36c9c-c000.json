Yet\\naccessibility refers not only to making legal documents available to the\\npublic, but also rendering legal information comprehensible to them. A vexing\\nproblem in bringing legal information to the public is how to turn formal legal\\ndocuments such as legislation and judgments, which are often highly technical,\\nto easily navigable and comprehensible knowledge to those without legal\\neducation. In this study, we formulate a three-step approach for bringing legal\\nknowledge to laypersons, tackling the issues of navigability and\\ncomprehensibility. First, we translate selected sections of the law into\\nsnippets (called CLIC-pages), each being a small piece of article that focuses\\non explaining certain technical legal concept in layperson's terms. Second, we\\nconstruct a Legal Question Bank (LQB), which is a collection of legal questions\\nwhose answers can be found in the CLIC-pages. Third, we design an interactive\\nCLIC Recommender (CRec). Given a user's verbal description of a legal situation\\nthat requires a legal solution, CRec interprets the user's input and shortlists\\nquestions from the question bank that are most likely relevant to the given\\nlegal situation and recommends their corresponding CLIC pages where relevant\\nlegal knowledge can be found. In this paper we focus on the technical aspects\\nof creating an LQB. We show how large-scale pre-trained language models, such\\nas GPT-3, can be used to generate legal questions. We compare machine-generated\\nquestions (MGQs) against human-composed questions (HCQs) and find that MGQs are\\nmore scalable, cost-effective, and more diversified, while HCQs are more\\nprecise. We also show a prototype of CRec and illustrate through an example how\\nour 3-step approach effectively brings relevant legal knowledge to the public.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T05:07:38Z\"}"}
