They can be viewed as an extension\\nof Fan type conditions in undirected graphs, as well as generalization of\\nlocally (in-, out-)semicomplete digraphs. Since their first appearance in 1996,\\nvarious Bang-Jensen-Gutin-Li type conditions for hamitonicity have come forth.\\nIn this paper we establish a condition of Bang-Jensen-Gutin-Li type which\\nimplies not only a hamiltonian cycle but also a 3-cycle and an (n-1)-cycle,\\nwith well-characterized exceptional graphs. We conjecture that this condition\\nimplies the existence of cycle of every length.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,G.2.2\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T13:30:11Z\"}"}
