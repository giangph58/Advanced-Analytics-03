{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14981v1\", \"title\": \"On feature representations for marmoset vocal communication analysis\", \"summary\": \"The acoustic analysis of marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) vocalizations is often\\nused to understand the evolutionary origins of human language. Currently, the\\nanalysis is largely carried out in a manual or semi-manual manner. Thus, there\\nis a need to develop automatic call analysis methods. In that direction,\\nresearch has been limited to the development of analysis methods with small\\namounts of data or for specific scenarios. Furthermore, there is lack of prior\\nknowledge about what type of information is relevant for different call\\nanalysis tasks. To address these issues, as a first step, this paper explores\\ndifferent feature representation methods, namely, HCTSA-based hand-crafted\\nfeatures Catch22, pre-trained self supervised learning (SSL) based features\\nextracted from neural networks trained on human speech and end-to-end acoustic\\nmodeling for call-type classification, caller identification and caller sex\\nidentification. Through an investigation on three different marmoset call\\ndatasets, we demonstrate that SSL-based feature representations and end-to-end\\nacoustic modeling tend to lead to better systems than Catch22 features for\\ncall-type and caller classification. Furthermore, we also highlight the impact\\nof signal bandwidth on the obtained task performances.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.AS\", \"categories\": \"eess.AS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T09:15:45Z\"}"}
