{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00363v1\", \"title\": \"Dust density enhancements and the direct formation of planetary cores in\\n  gravitationally unstable discs\", \"summary\": \"Planet formation via core accretion involves the growth of solids that can\\naccumulate to form planetary cores. There are a number of barriers to the\\ncollisional growth of solids in protostellar discs, one of which is the drift,\\nor metre, barrier. Solid particles experience a drag force that will tend to\\ncause them to drift towards the central star in smooth, laminar discs,\\npotentially removing particles before they grow large enough to decouple from\\nthe disc gas. Here we present 3-dimensional, shearing box simulations that\\nexplore the dynamical evolution of solids in a protostellar disc that is\\nmassive enough for the gravitational instability to manifest as spiral density\\nwaves. We expand on earlier work by considering a range of particle sizes and\\nfind that the spirals can still enhance the local solid density by more than an\\norder of magnitude, potentially aiding grain growth. Furthermore, if solid\\nparticles have enough mass, and the particle size distribution extends to\\nsufficiently large particle sizes, the solid component of the disc can undergo\\ndirect gravitational collapse to form bound clumps with masses typically\\nbetween $1$ and $10$ M$_\\\\oplus$. Thus, the concentration of dust in a\\nself-gravitating disc could bypass the size barrier for collisional growth and\\ndirectly form planetary cores early in the lifetime of the disc.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T07:22:15Z\"}"}
