{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17772v1\", \"title\": \"Demagnetization in micromagnetics: magnetostatic self-interactions of\\n  bulk chiral magnetic skyrmions\", \"summary\": \"It is known that the magnetization in a ferromagnet induces an internal\\ndemagnetizing magnetic field. This, in-turn, generates a magnetostatic\\nself-energy, coming from dipole-dipole interactions. In general, this energy is\\nsingular and intrinsically non-local. However, one can introduce a magnetic\\nscalar potential associated with the demagnetizing field. We show that\\ncomputation of the magnetic potential can be achieved by solving Poisson's\\nequation where the source is the divergence of the magnetization. Furthermore,\\nwe determine the variation of the magnetostatic self-energy and its associated\\nback-reaction on the magnetization. Then, we present a theoretical study of the\\neffect of the long-range dipolar interaction on magnetic skyrmion textures in\\nthe bulk of chiral ferromagnetic materials with the Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya\\ninteraction. It is observed that the demagnetizing dipolar self-interaction can\\nstabilize antiskyrmion crystals in Heusler compounds.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T17:47:57Z\"}"}
