Assuming that the velocity\\nfield has finite energy and that the stagnation set is connected, we prove that\\nthe corresponding stream function solves an autonomous semilinear elliptic\\nequation. Under some extra conditions on the vorticity near infinity we can\\nalso prove that the streamlines are concentric circles. The proofs include\\nseveral energy estimates on the behavior of the stream function at infinity, as\\nwell as an adaptation of the continuous Steiner symmetrization to our setting.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T16:24:12Z\"}"}
