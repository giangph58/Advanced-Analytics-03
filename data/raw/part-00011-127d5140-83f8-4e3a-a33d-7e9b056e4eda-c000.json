{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24259v1\", \"title\": \"Advances in Continual Graph Learning for Anti-Money Laundering Systems:\\n  A Comprehensive Review\", \"summary\": \"Financial institutions are required by regulation to report suspicious\\nfinancial transactions related to money laundering. Therefore, they need to\\nconstantly monitor vast amounts of incoming and outgoing transactions. A\\nparticular challenge in detecting money laundering is that money launderers\\ncontinuously adapt their tactics to evade detection. Hence, detection methods\\nneed constant fine-tuning. Traditional machine learning models suffer from\\ncatastrophic forgetting when fine-tuning the model on new data, thereby\\nlimiting their effectiveness in dynamic environments. Continual learning\\nmethods may address this issue and enhance current anti-money laundering (AML)\\npractices, by allowing models to incorporate new information while retaining\\nprior knowledge. Research on continual graph learning for AML, however, is\\nstill scarce. In this review, we critically evaluate state-of-the-art continual\\ngraph learning approaches for AML applications. We categorise methods into\\nreplay-based, regularization-based, and architecture-based strategies within\\nthe graph neural network (GNN) framework, and we provide in-depth experimental\\nevaluations on both synthetic and real-world AML data sets that showcase the\\neffect of the different hyperparameters. Our analysis demonstrates that\\ncontinual learning improves model adaptability and robustness in the face of\\nextreme class imbalances and evolving fraud patterns. Finally, we outline key\\nchallenges and propose directions for future research.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:06:47Z\"}"}
