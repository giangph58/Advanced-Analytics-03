{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02431v1\", \"title\": \"Koney: A Cyber Deception Orchestration Framework for Kubernetes\", \"summary\": \"System operators responsible for protecting software applications remain\\nhesitant to implement cyber deception technology, including methods that place\\ntraps to catch attackers, despite its proven benefits. Overcoming their\\nconcerns removes a barrier that currently hinders industry adoption of\\ndeception technology. Our work introduces deception policy documents to\\ndescribe deception technology \\\"as code\\\" and pairs them with Koney, a Kubernetes\\noperator, which facilitates the setup, rotation, monitoring, and removal of\\ntraps in Kubernetes. We leverage cloud-native technologies, such as service\\nmeshes and eBPF, to automatically add traps to containerized software\\napplications, without having access to the source code. We focus specifically\\non operational properties, such as maintainability, scalability, and\\nsimplicity, which we consider essential to accelerate the adoption of cyber\\ndeception technology and to facilitate further research on cyber deception.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T09:37:14Z\"}"}
