{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16772v1\", \"title\": \"Thermal Evolution and Mass Loss on Short-Period, Low-Mass Planets During\\n  FU Orionis Outbursts\", \"summary\": \"Ultra-short-period (USP) planets represent a unique class of exoplanets\\ncharacterized by their tight orbits and relatively low masses, with some also\\nexhibiting unusually high iron fractions. Previous work (Becker et al, 2021)\\nproposed a dynamical pathway wherein planets can migrate inward due to drag\\nfrom sub-Keplerian gas during episodic FU Orionis (FU Ori) outbursts, an abrupt\\naccretion phenomenon exhibited by young stellar objects, thereby potentially\\npopulating USP orbits. However, the implications of this migration process on\\nthe structural and compositional evolution of these planets remain unexplored.\\nIn this work, we model the response of a planet's surface material to the high\\ndisk temperatures characteristic of an FU Ori event and compute the fraction of\\nan Earth-like planet's mass that will be lost due to vaporization and\\nsubsequent turbulent diffusion of gaseous molecules during the FU Ori event. We\\nfind that low-mass planets may lose a substantial fraction of their mantle mass\\nduring FU Ori events, potentially contributing to the observed prevalence of\\nlow-mass, iron-rich USP planets.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T14:43:54Z\"}"}
