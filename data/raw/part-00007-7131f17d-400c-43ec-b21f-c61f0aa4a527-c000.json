This paper introduces an approach that eliminates\\northogonalization requirements in traditional Rayleigh-Ritz projection methods.\\nThe proposed method employs non-orthogonal bases computed at reduced precision,\\nresulting in bases computed without inner-products. A primary focus is on\\nmaintaining the linear independence of the basis vectors. Through extensive\\nevaluation with both synthetic test cases and real-world applications, we\\ndemonstrate that the proposed approach achieves the desired accuracy while\\nfully taking full advantage of mixed-precision arithmetic.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T04:05:58Z\"}"}
