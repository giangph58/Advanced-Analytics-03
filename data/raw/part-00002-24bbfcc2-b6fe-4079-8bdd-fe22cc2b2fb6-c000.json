We focus on the challenging case where the\\nnoise acts in as few as four directions, establishing new results for such high\\ndegeneracy. We first employ Malliavin calculus and anticipative stochastic\\ncalculus to demonstrate the equi-continuity of the semigroup (or so-called the\\ne-property), and then verify the weak irreducibility of the solution process.\\nTherefore, the uniqueness of invariant measure is proven.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T06:18:08Z\"}"}
