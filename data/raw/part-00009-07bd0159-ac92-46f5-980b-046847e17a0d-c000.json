Two words have the same commutative image when one\\nis a permutation of the symbols of the other. The commutative closure of a set\\n$ L \\\\subseteq A^* $ is the set $ {C}(L) \\\\subseteq A^* $ of words whose\\ncommutative image coincides with that of some word in $ L $. We provide an\\nalgorithm that, given a regular set $ L $, produces a finite state automaton\\nthat accepts the commutative closure $ {C}(L) $, provided that this closure set\\nis regular. The problem of deciding whether $ {C}(L) $ is regular was solved by\\nGinsburg and Spanier in 1966 using the decidability of Presburger sentences,\\nand by Gohon in 1985 via formal power series. The problem of constructing an\\nautomaton that accepts $ {C}(L) $ has already been studied in the literature.\\nWe give a simpler algorithm using an algebraic approach.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.FL\", \"categories\": \"cs.FL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T04:54:02Z\"}"}
