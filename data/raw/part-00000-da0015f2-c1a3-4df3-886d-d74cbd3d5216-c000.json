While the superconducting rectification\\neffect is a consequence of the asymmetric vortex pinning, the mechanisms to\\ndevelop its asymmetric potentials have been a subject of ongoing debate, mainly\\nfocusing on microscopic breaking of spatial inversion symmetry and macroscopic\\nimbalance of the sample structure. Here, we report on comparative study of the\\nsuperconducting diode effect and nonreciprocal resistance in a superconducting\\nFe(Se,Te)/FeTe heterostructure. In normal state, we observe finite\\nnonreciprocal resistance as a hallmark of the spin-orbit interaction with\\nstructural inversion asymmetry. In the superconducting state, we find that the\\nstrongly enhanced nonreciprocal coefficient in transition regime is directly\\ncoupled to the superconducting diode efficiency through a universal scaling\\nlaw, indicating the role of spin-momentum-locked state on the asymmetric\\npinning potential. Our findings, providing a unified picture of the\\nsuperconducting rectification, pave the way for functionalizing superconducting\\ndiode devices.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T11:20:04Z\"}"}
