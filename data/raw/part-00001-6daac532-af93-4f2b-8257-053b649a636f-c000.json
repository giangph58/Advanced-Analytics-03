{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10038v1\", \"title\": \"Luminis Stellarum et Machina: Applications of Machine Learning in Light\\n  Curve Analysis\", \"summary\": \"The rapid advancement of observational capabilities in astronomy has led to\\nan exponential growth in the volume of light curve (LC) data, presenting both\\nopportunities and challenges for time-domain astronomy. Traditional analytical\\nmethods often struggle to fully extract the scientific value of these vast\\ndatasets, especially as their complexity increases. Machine learning (ML)\\nalgorithms have become indispensable tools for analyzing light curves, offering\\nthe ability to classify, predict, discover patterns, and detect anomalies.\\nDespite the growing adoption of ML techniques, challenges remain in LC\\nclassification, including class imbalance, noisy data, and interpretability of\\nmodels. These challenges emphasize the importance of conducting a systematic\\nreview of ML algorithms specifically tailored for LC analysis. This survey\\nprovides a comprehensive overview of the latest ML techniques, summarizing\\ntheir principles and applications in key astronomical tasks such as exoplanet\\ndetection, variable star classification, and supernova identification. It also\\ndiscusses strategies to address the existing challenges and advance LC analysis\\nin the near future. As astronomical datasets continue to grow, the integration\\nof ML and deep learning (DL) techniques will be essential for unlocking the\\nfull scientific potential of LC data in the era of astronomical big data.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:40:30Z\"}"}
