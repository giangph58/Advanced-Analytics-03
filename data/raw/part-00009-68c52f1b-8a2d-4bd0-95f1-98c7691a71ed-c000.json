Given a pair of state- and\\ntarget- sets, our goal is to estimate the ROS such that the trajectories\\noriginating within it reach the target set (i.e., synchronization manifold),\\nwithout leaving the state set before the first hitting time. In order to do so,\\nan exponential guidance-barrier function is proposed to construct the ROS along\\nthe synchronization manifold, and the corresponding sufficient conditions for\\nestimating the ROS are developed. The resulting conditions lead to a\\nsum-of-squares programming problem, thereby affording a polynomial-time\\nsolvability. Furthermore, when the synchronization manifold reduces to an\\nequilibrium point, our method not only estimates a larger ROS compared to\\nexisting results but also allows the ROS to take more general shapes. Finally,\\nwe present two numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the\\ntheoretical results.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:16:49Z\"}"}
