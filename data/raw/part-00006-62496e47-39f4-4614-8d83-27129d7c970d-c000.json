SrTiO$_3$ is one\\nof the most studied oxide substrate materials for heterostructures. To date,\\nthe highest SrTiO3-based charge carrier mobility at 2 K was measured in the\\ninterfacial 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) of\\n$\\\\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$. The formation mechanism and origin of the high\\nelectron mobility are not yet fully understood. This investigation presents a\\nsuccessful growth protocol to synthesise high mobility\\n$\\\\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces, and a description of the underlying\\ngrowth optimisation. Furthermore, indicative features of high-mobility\\n$\\\\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$, including the room-temperature sheet\\nresistance, are presented. Signs of epitaxial and crystalline growth are found\\nin a high-mobility sample ($\\\\mu^{10K} = 1.6 \\\\times 10^4\\n\\\\mathrm{cm}^2/\\\\mathrm{Vs}$). Outlining the growth mechanisms and comparing 40\\nsamples, indicates that high-fluence ($F > 3\\\\mathrm{J}/\\\\mathrm{cm}^2$) and low\\npressure ($P \\\\approx 1 \\\\times 10^{-6} \\\\mathrm{mbar}$) are essential growth\\nparameters for high-mobility $\\\\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T16:30:32Z\"}"}
