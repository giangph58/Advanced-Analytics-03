For a left ideal in the\\nWeyl algebra that is of finite holonomic rank, we implement the computation of\\nthe encoded system of linear PDEs in connection form with respect to an\\nelimination term order that depends on a chosen positive weight vector. We also\\nimplement the gauge transformation for carrying out a change of basis over the\\nfield of rational functions. We demonstrate all implemented algorithms with\\nexamples.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG,cs.SC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T05:08:45Z\"}"}
