In a previous article [1], we pointed out that the GW spectrum from a\\npopulation of string loops in the scaling regime can exhibit a sharp cutoff\\nfrequency associated with the fundamental oscillation mode of string loops. In\\nthis paper, we study the effect of particle decay due to kink-kink collisions\\nand cusps on the GW spectrum in the nonscaling scenario introduced in Ref. [2].\\nWe find analytical conditions for the existence of a cutoff frequency in the\\nfundamental spectrum and provide expressions for this frequency. In large\\nregions of parameter space, our results in the nonscaling model turn out to be\\nidentical to those in the scaling model. Finally, we demonstrate how the\\nspectrum changes when transitioning from the regime with a cutoff frequency to\\nthe regime without a cutoff frequency. Our analytical estimates are validated\\nat qualitatively different benchmark points by comparing them with numerical\\nspectra.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T16:14:25Z\"}"}
