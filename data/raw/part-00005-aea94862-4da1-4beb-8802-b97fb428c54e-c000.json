{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10980v1\", \"title\": \"Planar Hall effect in ultrathin topological insulator films\", \"summary\": \"The planar Hall effect (PHE), previously observed in Weyl and Dirac\\nsemimetals due to the chiral anomaly, emerges with a different origin in\\ntopological insulators (TIs), where in-plane magnetic fields induce resistivity\\nanisotropy. In strictly two-dimensional TIs, PHE is generally suppressed due to\\nthe inability of the out-of-plane Berry curvature to couple to the in-plane\\nband velocity of the charge carriers. Here, we demonstrate that in ultrathin TI\\nfilms, a quasi-two-dimensional system, intersurface tunneling coupling with\\nin-plane magnetization induces electronic anisotropy, enabling a finite PHE. In\\naddition, we reveal that strong in-plane magnetization can stabilize the\\nthickness-dependent quantum anomalous Hall effect, typically associated with\\nout-of-plane magnetization. These insights advance the understanding of\\nmagnetic topological phases, paving the way for next-generation spintronic\\ndevices and magnetic sensing technologies.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T08:45:02Z\"}"}
