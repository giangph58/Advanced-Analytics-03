{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21353v1\", \"title\": \"Generative QoE Modeling: A Lightweight Approach for Telecom Networks\", \"summary\": \"Quality of Experience (QoE) prediction plays a crucial role in optimizing\\nresource management and enhancing user satisfaction across both\\ntelecommunication and OTT services. While recent advances predominantly rely on\\ndeep learning models, this study introduces a lightweight generative modeling\\nframework that balances computational efficiency, interpretability, and\\npredictive accuracy. By validating the use of Vector Quantization (VQ) as a\\npreprocessing technique, continuous network features are effectively\\ntransformed into discrete categorical symbols, enabling integration with a\\nHidden Markov Model (HMM) for temporal sequence modeling. This VQ-HMM pipeline\\nenhances the model's capacity to capture dynamic QoE patterns while supporting\\nprobabilistic inference on new and unseen data. Experimental results on\\npublicly available time-series datasets incorporating both objective indicators\\nand subjective QoE scores demonstrate the viability of this approach in\\nreal-time and resource-constrained environments, where inference latency is\\nalso critical. The framework offers a scalable alternative to complex deep\\nlearning methods, particularly in scenarios with limited computational\\nresources or where latency constraints are critical.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T06:19:37Z\"}"}
