For this, the task of 3D semantic occupancy\\nprediction divides the space around the sensors into voxels, and labels each\\nvoxel with both occupancy and semantic information. Recent perception models\\nhave used multisensor fusion to perform this task. However, existing\\nmultisensor fusion-based approaches focus mainly on using sensor information in\\nthe Cartesian coordinate system. This ignores the distribution of the sensor\\nreadings, leading to a loss of fine-grained details and performance\\ndegradation. In this paper, we propose OccCylindrical that merges and refines\\nthe different modality features under cylindrical coordinates. Our method\\npreserves more fine-grained geometry detail that leads to better performance.\\nExtensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset, including challenging\\nrainy and nighttime scenarios, confirm our approach's effectiveness and\\nstate-of-the-art performance.
