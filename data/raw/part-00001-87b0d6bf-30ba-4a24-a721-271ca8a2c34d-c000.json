In this\\nframework, we consider three types of TFBMs: two with a tempering factor\\nincorporated into their moving-average representation, and one with a tempering\\nparameter added to the autocorrelation formula. We illustrate their dynamics\\nwith the use of quantile lines. Using the proposed methodology, we provide a\\ncomprehensive power analysis of the tests. It appears that the tests allow\\ndistinguishing between the tempered processes with different Hurst parameters.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,physics.data-an\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T09:30:55Z\"}"}
