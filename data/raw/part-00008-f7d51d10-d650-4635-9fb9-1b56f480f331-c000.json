However, this narrative still requires thorough empirical\\ninvestigation to evaluate the practical implications, benefits, and challenges.\\nIn this work, we propose a novel methodology for evaluating urban accessibility\\nto services, with an application to the city of Florence, Italy. Our approach\\ninvolves identifying the accessibility of essential services from residential\\nbuildings within a 10-minute walking distance, employing a rigorous spatial\\nanalysis process and open-source geospatial data. As a second contribution, we\\nextend the concept of 10-minute accessibility within a network theory framework\\nand apply a clustering algorithm to identify urban communities based on shared\\naccess to essential services. Finally, we explore the dimension of functional\\nredundancy. Our proposed metrics represent a step forward towards an accurate\\nassessment of the adherence to the 10-minute city model and offer a valuable\\ntool for place-based policies aimed at addressing spatial disparities in urban\\ndevelopment.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T13:28:21Z\"}"}
