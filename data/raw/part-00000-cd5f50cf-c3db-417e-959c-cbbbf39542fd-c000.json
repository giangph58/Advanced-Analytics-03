{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16024v1\", \"title\": \"EnsAI: An Emulator for Atmospheric Chemical Ensembles\", \"summary\": \"Ensemble-based methods for data assimilation and emission inversions are a\\npopular way to encode flow-dependency within the model error covariance. While\\nmost ensemble methods do not require the use of an adjoint model, the need to\\nrepeatedly run a geophysical model to generate the ensemble can be a\\nsignificant computational burden. In this paper, we introduce EnsAI, a new\\nAI-based ensemble generation system for atmospheric chemical constituents. When\\ntrained on an existing ensemble for ammonia generated by the GEM-MACH air\\nquality model, it was shown that the ensembles produced by EnsAI can accurately\\nreproduce the meteorology-dependent features of the original ensemble, while\\ngenerating the ensemble 3,300 times faster than the original GEM-MACH ensemble.\\nWhile EnsAI requires an upfront cost for generating an ensemble used for\\ntraining, as well as the training itself, the long term computational savings\\ncan greatly exceed these initial computational costs. When used in an emissions\\ninversion system, EnsAI produced similar inversion results to those in which\\nthe original GEM-MACH ensemble was used while using significantly less\\ncomputational resources.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T16:41:26Z\"}"}
