{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11209v1\", \"title\": \"The CMS Barrel Timing Layer: test beam confirmation of module timing\\n  performance\", \"summary\": \"First of its kind, the barrel section of the MIP Timing Detector is a large\\narea timing detector based on LYSO:Ce crystals and SiPMs which are required to\\noperate in an unprecedentedly harsh radiation environment (up to an integrated\\nfluence of $2\\\\times10^{14}$ 1 MeV $n_{eq}/cm^2$). It is designed as a key\\nelement of the upgrade of the existing CMS detector to provide a time\\nresolution for minimum ionizing particles in the range between 30-60 ps\\nthroughout the entire operation at the High Luminosity LHC. A thorough\\noptimization of its components has led to the final detector module layout\\nwhich exploits 25 $\\\\rm \\\\mu m$ cell size SiPMs and 3.75 mm thick crystals. This\\ndesign achieved the target performance in a series of test beam campaigns. In\\nthis paper we present test beam results which demonstrate the desired\\nperformance of detector modules in terms of radiation tolerance, time\\nresolution and response uniformity.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:12:28Z\"}"}
