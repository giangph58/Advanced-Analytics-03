We address this question with a\\nsimple experiment: starting from a large, homogeneous catalog, we remove\\nplanets and monitor how several well-defined metrics of the system architecture\\nchange. We first perform this test on a catalog of observed exoplanets. We then\\nrepeat our test on a catalog of synthetic planetary systems with underlying\\nhyperparameters that have been fit to reproduce the observed systems as\\nfaithfully as possible (though imperfectly). For both samples, we find that the\\nfailure to detect one or more planets tends to create more irregularly spaced\\nplanets, whereas the planet mass similarity and coplanarity are essentially\\nunaffected. One key difference between the synthetic and observed data sets is\\nthat the observed systems have more evenly spaced planets than the\\nobservation-bias-applied synthetic systems. Since our tests show that detection\\nbias tends to increase irregularity in spacing, the even spacing in the\\nobserved planetary systems is likely astrophysical rather than the result of\\nthe Kepler missions' inherent detection biases. Our findings support the\\ninterpretation that planets in the same system have similar sizes and regular\\nspacing and reinforce the need to develop an underlying model of planetary\\narchitectures that reproduces these observed patterns.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T16:02:58Z\"}"}
