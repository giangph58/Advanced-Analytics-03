This paper presents\\nthe novel deployment of an Evolving Type-2 Quantum Fuzzy Neural Network\\n(eT2QFNN) for modeling the aerodynamic coefficients of the ATTAS aircraft to\\nexpress the aerodynamic characteristics. eT2QFNN can represent the nonlinear\\naircraft model by creating multiple linear submodels with its rule-based\\nstructure through an incremental learning strategy rather than a traditional\\nbatch learning approach. Moreover, it enhances robustness to uncertainties and\\ndata noise through its quantum membership functions, as well as its automatic\\nrule-learning and parameter-tuning capabilities. During the estimation of the\\naerodynamic coefficients via the flight data of the ATTAS, two different\\nstudies are conducted in the training phase: one with a large amount of data\\nand the other with a limited amount of data. The results show that the modeling\\nperformance of the eT2QFNN is superior in comparison to baseline counterparts.\\nFurthermore, eT2QFNN estimated the aerodynamic model with fewer rules compared\\nto Type-1 fuzzy counterparts. In addition, by applying the Delta method to the\\nproposed approach, the stability and control derivatives of the aircraft are\\nanalyzed. The results prove the superiority of the proposed eT2QFNN in\\nrepresenting aerodynamic coefficients.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.AI,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:21:20Z\"}"}
