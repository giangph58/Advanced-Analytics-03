In\\nparticular, when the initial data for the vorticity resides in an anisotropic\\nSobolev space of size $ O(\\\\min \\\\{ \\\\mu^{\\\\frac{1}{2}}, \\\\nu^{\\\\frac{1}{2}}\\\\})$, and\\nthe initial perturbation of the temperature resides in an anisotropic Sobolev\\nspace of size $ O(\\\\min \\\\{ \\\\mu, \\\\nu\\\\})$, we derive the nonlinear enhanced\\ndissipation effect and the inviscid damping effect for the NSB system.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:09:57Z\"}"}
