{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01622v1\", \"title\": \"Higgs-Modular Inflation\", \"summary\": \"We investigate the role of the Higgs field as a fundamental scalar in the\\nStandard Model within the framework of modular inflation models, where a\\nmodulus field acts as the inflaton and its interactions are governed by an\\nunderlying modular symmetry. In general, the Higgs field can participate in the\\ndynamics of modular inflation, leading to a two-field inflationary\\nsystem-termed \\\\emph{Higgs-Modular inflation}-which exhibits non-trivial\\ndynamics and interesting phenomenological implications. We analyze\\nHiggs-Modular inflation both analytically and numerically, highlighting its\\nattractor behavior and the resulting observational constraints. In particular,\\nwe find that Higgs-Modular inflation is favored by the latest data release from\\nthe Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) in certain regions of parameter space.\\nThis is in contrast to both pure Higgs inflation and pure modular inflation\\nwith a Starobinsky-type potential, which tend to predict a relatively low\\nspectral index. Additionally, we discuss the cutoff scale of this inflationary\\nmodel and the reheating processes induced by the decays of the modulus and the\\nHiggs field.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:30:09Z\"}"}
