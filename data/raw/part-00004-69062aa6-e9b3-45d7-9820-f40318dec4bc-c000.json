In this work, we perform\\nseveral numerical consistency checks of the output of mpNRG by investigating\\nexact relations between two- and four-point functions. This includes the\\nBethe-Salpeter equations and the Schwinger-Dyson equation from the parquet\\nformalism, which we evaluate in two formally identical but numerically\\nnonequivalent ways. We also study the first-order U(1) Ward identity between\\nthe vertex and the self-energy, which we derive for the first time in full\\ngenerality in the real-frequency Keldysh formalism. We generally find good\\nagreement of all relations, often up to a few percent, both at weak and at\\nstrong interaction.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T11:06:06Z\"}"}
