{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01662v1\", \"title\": \"BioAtt: Anatomical Prior Driven Low-Dose CT Denoising\", \"summary\": \"Deep-learning-based denoising methods have significantly improved Low-Dose CT\\n(LDCT) image quality. However, existing models often over-smooth important\\nanatomical details due to their purely data-driven attention mechanisms. To\\naddress this challenge, we propose a novel LDCT denoising framework, BioAtt.\\nThe key innovation lies in attending anatomical prior distributions extracted\\nfrom the pretrained vision-language model BiomedCLIP. These priors guide the\\ndenoising model to focus on anatomically relevant regions to suppress noise\\nwhile preserving clinically relevant structures. We highlight three main\\ncontributions: BioAtt outperforms baseline and attention-based models in SSIM,\\nPSNR, and RMSE across multiple anatomical regions. The framework introduces a\\nnew architectural paradigm by embedding anatomic priors directly into spatial\\nattention. Finally, BioAtt attention maps provide visual confirmation that the\\nimprovements stem from anatomical guidance rather than increased model\\ncomplexity.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:14:04Z\"}"}
