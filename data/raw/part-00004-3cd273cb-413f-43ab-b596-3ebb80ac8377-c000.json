I show in this context that the most\\naccurate classifier is either a threshold or a negative threshold rule. A\\nthreshold rule offers the \\\"good\\\" classification to those individuals whose\\noutcome likelihoods are greater than some cutpoint, while a negative threshold\\nrule offers the \\\"good\\\" outcome to those whose outcome likelihoods are less than\\nsome cutpoint. While seemingly pathological, I show that a negative threshold\\nrule can be the most accurate classifier when outcomes are performative. I\\nprovide an example of such a classifier, and extend the analysis to more\\ngeneral algorithm objectives, allowing the algorithm to differentially weigh\\nfalse negatives and false positives, for example.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.TH\", \"categories\": \"econ.TH,cs.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T15:21:02Z\"}"}
