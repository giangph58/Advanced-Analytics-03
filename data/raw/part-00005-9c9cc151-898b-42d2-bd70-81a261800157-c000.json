These artifacts promote\\nreuse, scalability, and consistency, but also embed tradeoffs that shape\\ncritical quality attributes such as modifiability, performance, and security.\\nExisting evaluation methods, such as the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method\\n(ATAM), focus on system-specific architectures and are not designed to address\\nthe broader generality and variability of higher-level architectural forms. To\\nclose this gap, we introduce the Architecture Tradeoff and Risk Analysis\\nFramework (ATRAF) -- a unified, scenario-driven framework for evaluating\\ntradeoffs and risks across architectural levels. ATRAF encompasses three\\nmethods: the Architecture Tradeoff and Risk Analysis Method (ATRAM), extending\\nATAM with enhanced risk identification for concrete systems; the Reference\\nArchitecture Tradeoff and Risk Analysis Method (RATRAM), adapting ATRAM to the\\nevaluation of domain-level reference architectures; and the Architectural\\nFramework Tradeoff and Risk Analysis Method (AFTRAM), supporting the evaluation\\nof architectural frameworks that guide entire system families. All three\\nmethods follow an iterative spiral process that enables the identification of\\nsensitivities, tradeoffs, and risks while supporting continuous refinement of\\narchitectural artifacts. We demonstrate ATRAF through progressively abstracted\\nexamples derived from the Remote Temperature Sensor (RTS) case, originally\\nintroduced in the ATAM literature. ATRAF equips architects, reference modelers,\\nand framework designers with a practical, systematic approach for analyzing\\ndesign alternatives and managing quality attribute tradeoffs early in the\\nlifecycle and across all levels of architectural abstraction.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T17:48:52Z\"}"}
