{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04918v1\", \"title\": \"Physics-Assisted and Topology-Informed Deep Learning for Weather\\n  Prediction\", \"summary\": \"Although deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable potential in\\nweather prediction, most of them overlook either the \\\\textbf{physics} of the\\nunderlying weather evolution or the \\\\textbf{topology} of the Earth's surface.\\nIn light of these disadvantages, we develop PASSAT, a novel Physics-ASSisted\\nAnd Topology-informed deep learning model for weather prediction. PASSAT\\nattributes the weather evolution to two key factors: (i) the advection process\\nthat can be characterized by the advection equation and the Navier-Stokes\\nequation; (ii) the Earth-atmosphere interaction that is difficult to both model\\nand calculate. PASSAT also takes the topology of the Earth's surface into\\nconsideration, other than simply treating it as a plane. With these\\nconsiderations, PASSAT numerically solves the advection equation and the\\nNavier-Stokes equation on the spherical manifold, utilizes a spherical graph\\nneural network to capture the Earth-atmosphere interaction, and generates the\\ninitial velocity fields that are critical to solving the advection equation\\nfrom the same spherical graph neural network. In the $5.625^\\\\circ$-resolution\\nERA5 data set, PASSAT outperforms both the state-of-the-art deep learning-based\\nweather prediction models and the operational numerical weather prediction\\nmodel IFS T42. Code and checkpoint are available at\\nhttps://github.com/Yumenomae/PASSAT_5p625.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T03:25:55Z\"}"}
