{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04510v1\", \"title\": \"Design, Fabrication and Characterization of a Bias Supply Circuit for\\n  Silicon Photomultipliers\", \"summary\": \"To assess the viability of a shallow-depth neutrino detector, a Cosmic Muon\\nVeto Detector (CMVD) is being constructed on top of the stack of Resistive\\nPlate Chamber (RPC) detectors at TIFR, Mumbai. The CMVD employs extruded\\nplastic scintillators for muon detection, with wavelength-shifting fibers\\ncoupled to silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) for signal readout. A highly\\nstable, low-noise power source is essential for biasing the SiPMs, as the\\nprecision, accuracy, and stability of the supply directly impact the\\nconsistency of their gain. To address this, we designed a biasing power supply\\ncapable of delivering 50-58 V in 50 mV steps, with a maximum short-circuit\\ncurrent output of 1 mA. The system incorporates digital voltage control,\\nstabilization, and current monitoring, making it compatible with external\\ncontrollers (such as microcontrollers). This added flexibility and modularity\\nallow for additional functionalities, including temperature compensation.\\nDesigned to supply multiple SiPMs with close to breakdown voltages in parallel,\\nthe circuit seamlessly integrates with the front-end electronics of the\\ndetector system.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T15:30:25Z\"}"}
