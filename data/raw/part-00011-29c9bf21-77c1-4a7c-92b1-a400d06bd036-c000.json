However, while its unique\\nbackground knowledge guarantees accurate semantic reasoning and recovery,\\nsemantic information security-related concerns are introduced at the same time.\\nSince the potential eavesdroppers may have the same background knowledge to\\naccurately decrypt the private semantic information transmitted between legal\\nSemCom users, this makes the knowledge management in SemCom networks rather\\nchallenging in joint consideration with the power control. To this end, this\\npaper focuses on jointly addressing three core issues of power allocation,\\nknowledge base caching (KBC), and device-to-device (D2D) user pairing (DUP) in\\nsecure SemCom networks. We first develop a novel performance metric, namely\\nsemantic secrecy throughput (SST), to quantify the information security level\\nthat can be achieved at each pair of D2D SemCom users. Next, an SST\\nmaximization problem is formulated subject to secure SemCom-related delay and\\nreliability constraints. Afterward, we propose a security-aware resource\\nmanagement solution using the Lagrange primal-dual method and a two-stage\\nmethod. Simulation results demonstrate our proposed solution nearly doubles the\\nSST performance and realizes less than half of the queuing delay performance\\ncompared to different benchmarks.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T17:39:59Z\"}"}
