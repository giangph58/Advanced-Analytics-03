{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03578v1\", \"title\": \"On the non-Markovian quantum stochastic network dynamics\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we investigate the non-Markovian quantum dynamics based on\\nquantum noise properties in a network of atoms mediated by a waveguide. In such\\nnetworks, quantum coherent feedback control becomes achievable when coherent\\nfields (or quantum noises) in the form of photons with continuous modes\\npropagate through the waveguide. Different from traditional Markovian quantum\\nsystems, the non-Markovian quantum network can be regarded as a quantum system\\ninteracting with multiple input quantum noise channels with different time\\ndelays, and the \\\\rm{It\\\\={o}} relationships among different quantum noise\\nchannels can be represented with a non-Markovian integral process with integral\\nkernels determined by the relative distances among atoms and their coupling\\nmethods to the waveguide. Then the non-Markovian dynamics of the quantum\\nnetwork can be modeled with the quantum stochastic differential equation\\n(QSDE), which contains an integral process with integral kernels determined by\\nthe \\\\rm{It\\\\={o}} relationships among quantum noises. Utilizing this modeling\\napproach from the perspective of quantum noises, the control dynamics can be\\nclarified according to the noise properties and measurement results of the\\nnon-Markovian quantum network can be evaluated at the output end, which can be\\nfurther used in the filtering of quantum states within Markovian\\napproximations.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T14:39:37Z\"}"}
