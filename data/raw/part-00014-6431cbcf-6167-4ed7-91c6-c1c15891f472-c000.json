Here we propose\\na generalization of the traditional rock-paper-scissors model by considering\\nhighly reactive species, i. e., species that react in a stronger manner\\ncompared to the others in respect to either competition or reproduction. These\\ntwo classes of models, called here Highly Competitive and Highly Reproductive\\nmodels, may lead to hierarchical and non-hierarchical dynamics, depending on\\nthe number of highly reactive species. The fundamental feature of these models\\nis the fact that hierarchical models may as well support biodiversity, however,\\nwith a higher probability of extinction than the non-hierarchical ones, which\\nare in fact more robust. This analysis is done by evaluating the probability of\\nextinction as a function of mobility. In particular, we have analyzed how the\\ndominance scheme changes depending on the highly reactive species for\\nnon-hierarchical models, where the findings lead to the conclusion that highly\\nreactive species are usually at a disadvantage compared to the others.\\nMoreover, we have investigated the power spectrum and the characteristic length\\nof each species, including more information on the behavior of the several\\nsystems considered in the present work.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.PE\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.PE,physics.bio-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T13:09:18Z\"}"}
