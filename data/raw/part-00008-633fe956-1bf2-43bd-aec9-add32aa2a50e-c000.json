{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12627v1\", \"title\": \"Uncertainty Quantification in Graph Neural Networks with Shallow\\n  Ensembles\", \"summary\": \"Machine-learned potentials (MLPs) have revolutionized materials discovery by\\nproviding accurate and efficient predictions of molecular and material\\nproperties. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a state-of-the-art\\napproach due to their ability to capture complex atomic interactions. However,\\nGNNs often produce unreliable predictions when encountering out-of-domain data\\nand it is difficult to identify when that happens. To address this challenge,\\nwe explore Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) techniques, focusing on Direct\\nPropagation of Shallow Ensembles (DPOSE) as a computationally efficient\\nalternative to deep ensembles. By integrating DPOSE into the SchNet model, we\\nassess its ability to provide reliable uncertainty estimates across diverse\\nDensity Functional Theory datasets, including QM9, OC20, and Gold Molecular\\nDynamics. Our findings often demonstrate that DPOSE successfully distinguishes\\nbetween in-domain and out-of-domain samples, exhibiting higher uncertainty for\\nunobserved molecule and material classes. This work highlights the potential of\\nlightweight UQ methods in improving the robustness of GNN-based materials\\nmodeling and lays the foundation for future integration with active learning\\nstrategies.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T04:02:53Z\"}"}
