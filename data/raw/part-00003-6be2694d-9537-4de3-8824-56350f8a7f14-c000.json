Today,\\nit is known to be true only in ambient dimension less or equal than three or\\nassuming Koszul-freeness. Thanks to our advances in the comprehension of strong\\nEuler-homogeneity, we are able to prove the conjecture in the following new\\ncases: assuming strong Euler-homogeneity on a punctured neighbourhood of a\\npoint; assuming the divisor is weakly Koszul-free; for ambient dimension $n=4$;\\nfor linear free divisors in ambient dimension $n=5$. We also refute a\\nconjecture that states that all linear free divisors satisfy LCT and are\\nstrongly Euler-homogeneous.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG,math.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:43:17Z\"}"}
