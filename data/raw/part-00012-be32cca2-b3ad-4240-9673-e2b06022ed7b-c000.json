One construction\\nyields the canonical triangulation, and one yields a triangulation that we\\nconjecture is minimal. We prove that both are geometric, meaning they are built\\nof positively oriented convex hyperbolic tetrahedra. We use the conjecturally\\nminimal triangulation to present eight equations cutting out the A-polynomial\\nof these knots.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GT\", \"categories\": \"math.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T05:50:29Z\"}"}
