Unlike previous industrial revolutions,\\nhumans are at the core of the fifth generation of the Industrial Revolution.\\nOne of the critical aspects of Industry 5.0 (I 5.0) is its emphasis on\\nhuman-centricity. The integration of modern technologies can be clearly\\nobserved in smart factories, which offer enhanced comfort and professionalism.\\nThis study highlights the significance of I 5.0 and smart factory production\\n(SFP). A total of 36 articles are reviewed and systematically categorized using\\nthe meta-synthesis methodology. The research emphasizes the influence of I 5.0\\non SFP through the use of modern technologies and comprehensive policy\\nframeworks. This new paradigm has the potential to streamline people's lives\\nand bring a transformative shift to smart factory production lines. Enhancing\\nthe structure of factories appears feasible under this optimistic perspective.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T11:18:47Z\"}"}
