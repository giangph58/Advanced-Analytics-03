As a\\nmathematical model for the two-phase fluid on the detailed scale we chose a\\nnon-local version of the Navier$-$Stokes$-$Korteweg equations in the\\none-dimensional and periodic setting. Our justification relies on anticipating\\nthe macroscopic description of the two-phase fluid as the limit system for a\\nsequence of solutions with highly oscillating initial densities. Interpreting\\nthe density as a parametrized measure, we extract a limit system consisting of\\na kinetic equation for the parametrized measure and a momentum equation for the\\nvelocity. Under the assumption that the initial density distributions converge\\nin the limit to a convex combination of Dirac-measures, we show by a uniqueness\\nresult that the parametrized measure also has to be a convex combination of\\nDirac-measures and, that the limit system reduces to the Baer$-$Nunziato\\nsystem. This work extends existing results concerning the justification of\\nBaer$-$Nunziato models as the macroscopic description of multi-fluid models in\\nthe sense, that we allow for phase transition effects on the detailed scale.\\nThis work also includes a new global-in-time well-posedness result for the\\nCauchy problem of the non-local Navier$-$Stokes$-$Korteweg equations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T12:16:16Z\"}"}
