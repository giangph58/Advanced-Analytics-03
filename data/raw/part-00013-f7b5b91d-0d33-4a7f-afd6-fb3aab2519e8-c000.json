{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09902v1\", \"title\": \"Quantum Image Visualizer: Visual Debugging of Quantum Image Processing\\n  Circuits\", \"summary\": \"Quantum computing is an emerging field that utilizes the unique principles of\\nquantum mechanics to offer significant advantages in algorithm execution over\\nclassical approaches. This potential is particularly promising in the domain of\\nquantum image processing, which aims to manipulate all pixels simultaneously.\\nHowever, the process of designing and verifying these algorithms remains a\\ncomplex and error-prone task. To address this challenge, new methods are needed\\nto support effective debugging of quantum circuits. The Quantum Image\\nVisualizer is an interactive visual analysis tool that allows for the\\nexamination of quantum images and their transformation throughout quantum\\ncircuits. The framework incorporates two overview visualizations that trace\\nimage evolution across a sequence of gates based on the most probable outcomes.\\nInteractive exploration allows users to focus on relevant gates, and select\\npixels of interest. Upon selection, detailed visualizations enable in-depth\\ninspection of individual pixels and their probability distributions, revealing\\nhow specific gates influence the likelihood of pixel color values and the\\nmagnitude of these changes. An evaluation of the Quantum Image Visualizer was\\nconducted through in-depth interviews with eight domain experts. The findings\\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and practical value of our approach in supporting\\nvisual debugging of quantum image processing circuits.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T05:50:41Z\"}"}
