{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06979v1\", \"title\": \"Artificial Intelligence for Pediatric Height Prediction Using\\n  Large-Scale Longitudinal Body Composition Data\", \"summary\": \"This study developed an accurate artificial intelligence model for predicting\\nfuture height in children and adolescents using anthropometric and body\\ncomposition data from the GP Cohort Study (588,546 measurements from 96,485\\nchildren aged 7-18). The model incorporated anthropometric measures, body\\ncomposition, standard deviation scores, and growth velocity parameters, with\\nperformance evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. Results showed high accuracy\\nwith males achieving average RMSE, MAE, and MAPE of 2.51 cm, 1.74 cm, and\\n1.14%, and females showing 2.28 cm, 1.68 cm, and 1.13%, respectively.\\nExplainable AI approaches identified height SDS, height velocity, and soft lean\\nmass velocity as crucial predictors. The model generated personalized growth\\ncurves by estimating individual-specific height trajectories, offering a robust\\ntool for clinical decision support, early identification of growth disorders,\\nand optimization of growth outcomes.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.QM\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.QM,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T15:32:15Z\"}"}
