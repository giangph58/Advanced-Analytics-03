This paper\\nestablishes a linear upper bound of \\\\(3n-5\\\\) for generating sets that contain a\\nmatrix whose minimal polynomial has a degree exceeding \\\\(\\\\frac{n}{2}\\\\), where\\n\\\\(n\\\\) denotes the order of the matrix. Compared to the bound provided in\\n\\\\cite[Theorem 3.1]{r2}, this result reduces the constraints on the Jordan\\ncanonical forms. Additionally, it is demonstrated that the bound\\n\\\\(\\\\frac{7n}{2}-4\\\\) holds when the generating set contains a matrix with a\\nminimal polynomial of degree \\\\(t\\\\) satisfying \\\\(2t\\\\le n\\\\le 3t-1\\\\). The primary\\nenhancements consist of quantitative bounds and reduced reliance on Jordan form\\nstructural constraints.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RA\", \"categories\": \"math.RA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T08:09:32Z\"}"}
