In order to produce such data, bias-correction is often needed. Most of\\nthose statistical methods correct the probability distributions of daily\\nprecipitation by modeling them using either empirical or parametric\\ndistributions. A recent semi-parametric model based on a penalized Berk-Jones\\n(BJ) statistical test which allows for an automatic and personalized splicing\\nof parametric and nonparametric has been developed. This method, called\\nStitch-BJ model, was found to be able to model daily precipitation correctly\\nand showed interesting potential in a bias-correction setting. In the present\\nstudy, we will consolidate these results by taking into account the seasonal\\nproperties of daily precipitation in an out-of-sample context, and by\\nconsidering dry days probabilities in our methodology. We evaluate the\\nperformance of the Stitch-BJ method in this seasonal bias-correction setting\\nagainst more classical models such as the Gamma, Exponentiated Weibull (ExpW),\\nExtended Generalized Pareto (EGP) or empirical distributions. The Stitch-BJ\\ndistribution was able to consistently perform as well or better than all the\\nother models over the validation set, including the empirical distribution,\\nwhich is often used due to its robustness.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T06:48:42Z\"}"}
