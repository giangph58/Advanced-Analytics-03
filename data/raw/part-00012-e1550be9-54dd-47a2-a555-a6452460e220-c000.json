By employing analogical reasoning and black box\\nmodeling, students engage in experimental investigation and collaborative\\nproblem-solving to explore atomic structure. The activity was implemented as a\\ncase study with a class of first-year students (aged 14-15) from a applied\\nscience-focused secondary school in Italy. Data collection combined qualitative\\nobservations, structured discussions, and digital feedback tools to assess\\nconceptual learning and student engagement. Findings indicate that\\nwell-designed, student-centered interventions can meaningfully support the\\ndevelopment of abstract scientific understanding, while fostering critical\\nthinking and collaborative skills.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ed-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ed-ph,nucl-ex,physics.app-ph,physics.hist-ph,physics.soc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:12:23Z\"}"}
