Arriving jobs are classified into heterogeneous types, in accordance\\nwith their setup times which are differentiated at each of the pools. A\\ndispatcher for each job type controls the balance of load between pools, based\\non decentralized feedback. The system of rates and queues is modeled by a fluid\\ndifferential equation system, and analyzed via convex optimization. A first,\\nmyopic policy is proposed, based on task delay-to-service. Under a simplified\\ndynamic fluid queue model, we prove global convergence to an equilibrium point\\nwhich minimizes the mean setup time; however queueing delays are incurred with\\nthis method. A second proposal is then developed based on proximal\\noptimization, which explicitly models the setup queue and is proved to reach an\\noptimal equilibrium, devoid of queueing delay. Results are demonstrated through\\na simulation example.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T14:57:01Z\"}"}
