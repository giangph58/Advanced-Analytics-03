In this work, we propose an eXplainable AI\\n(XAI) methodology based on Inverse Optimal Control (IOC) to obtain local\\nexplanations for the behavior of a controller operating around a given region.\\nSpecifically, we extract the weights assigned to tracking errors and control\\neffort in the implicit cost function that a black-box controller is optimizing,\\noffering a more transparent and interpretable representation of the\\ncontroller's underlying objectives. This approach presents connections with\\nwell-established XAI techniques, such as Local Interpretable Model-agnostic\\nExplanations (LIME) since it is still based on a local approximation of the\\ncontrol policy. However, rather being limited to a standard sensitivity\\nanalysis, the explanation provided by our method relies on the solution of an\\ninverse Linear Quadratic (LQ) problem, offering a structured and more\\ncontrol-relevant perspective. Numerical examples demonstrate that the inferred\\ncost function consistently provides a deeper understanding of the controller's\\ndecision-making process, shedding light on otherwise counterintuitive or\\nunexpected phenomena.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T17:56:24Z\"}"}
