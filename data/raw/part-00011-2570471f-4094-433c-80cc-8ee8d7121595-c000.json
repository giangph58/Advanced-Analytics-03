These processes are color-suppressed\\nat the quark level, as inferred from topological diagram analysis. In this\\nwork, we calculate the branching fractions of the decays $B \\\\to \\\\psi K$, where\\n$\\\\psi$ denotes the charmonium(like) states $\\\\psi(1S)$, $\\\\psi(2S)$,\\n$\\\\psi(4040)$, $\\\\psi(3770)$, and $\\\\psi(4160)$. Our analysis incorporates both\\nshort-distance (naive factorization approach) and long-distance (final-state\\ninteractions) contributions. Within reasonable parameters, our results align\\nwith experimental data except for the $ \\\\psi(4160)$, suggesting its possible\\nexotic nature. Furthermore, we find that long-distance contributions dominate\\nthese decay processes, highlighting the crucial role of final-state\\ninteractions in the productions of charmonium(like) states in $B$ decays.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T12:09:26Z\"}"}
