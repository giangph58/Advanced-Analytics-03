{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10225v1\", \"title\": \"A Quasi-Steady-State Black Box Simulation Approach for the Generation of\\n  g-g-g-v Diagrams\", \"summary\": \"The classical g-g diagram, representing the achievable acceleration space for\\na vehicle, is commonly used as a constraint in trajectory planning and control\\ndue to its computational simplicity. To address non-planar road geometries,\\nthis concept can be extended to incorporate g-g constraints as a function of\\nvehicle speed and vertical acceleration, commonly referred to as g-g-g-v\\ndiagrams. However, the estimation of g-g-g-v diagrams is an open problem.\\nExisting simulation-based approaches struggle to isolate non-transient,\\nopen-loop stable states across all combinations of speed and acceleration,\\nwhile optimization-based methods often require simplified vehicle equations and\\nhave potential convergence issues. In this paper, we present a novel,\\nopen-source, quasi-steady-state black box simulation approach that applies a\\nvirtual inertial force in the longitudinal direction. The method emulates the\\nload conditions associated with a specified longitudinal acceleration while\\nmaintaining constant vehicle speed, enabling open-loop steering ramps in a\\npurely QSS manner. Appropriate regulation of the ramp steer rate inherently\\nmitigates transient vehicle dynamics when determining the maximum feasible\\nlateral acceleration. Moreover, treating the vehicle model as a black box\\neliminates model mismatch issues, allowing the use of high-fidelity or\\nproprietary vehicle dynamics models typically unsuited for optimization\\napproaches.
