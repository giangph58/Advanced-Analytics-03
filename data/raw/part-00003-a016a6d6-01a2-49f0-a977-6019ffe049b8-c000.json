{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12168v1\", \"title\": \"A simple algorithm for the simple bilevel programming (SBP) problem\", \"summary\": \"In this article we intend to develop a simple and implementable algorithm for\\nminimizing a convex function over the solution set of another convex\\noptimization problem. Such a problem is often referred to as a simple bilevel\\nprogramming (SBP) problem. One of the key features of our algorithm is that we\\nmake no assumption on the diferentiability of the upper level objective, though\\nwe will assume that the lower level objective is smooth. Another key feature of\\nthe algorithm is that it does not assume that the lower level objective has a\\nLipschitz gradient, which is a standard assumption in most of the well-known\\nalgorithms for this class of problems. We present the convergence analysis and\\nalso some numerical experiments demonstrating the efectiveness of the\\nalgorithm.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T15:19:08Z\"}"}
