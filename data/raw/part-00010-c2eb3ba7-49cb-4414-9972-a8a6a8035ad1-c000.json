In scenarios where neither the exact delays\\ninformation nor their bound is known, we propose a class of linear time-varying\\nstate feedback controllers by using the solution to a parametric Lyapunov\\nequation (PLE). By leveraging the properties of the solution to the PLE and\\nconstructing a time-varying Lyapunov-Krasovskii-like functional, we prove that\\n(the zero solution of) the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable.\\nFurthermore, this result is extended to the observer-based output feedback\\ncase. The notable characteristic of these controllers is their utilization of\\nlinear time-varying gains. Furthermore, they are designed entirely independent\\nof any knowledge of the time delays, resulting in controllers that are\\nexceedingly easy to implement. Finally, a numerical example demonstrates the\\neffectiveness of the proposed approaches.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T10:23:23Z\"}"}
