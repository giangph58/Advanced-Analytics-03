{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23794v1\", \"title\": \"Force-Free Molecular Dynamics Through Autoregressive Equivariant\\n  Networks\", \"summary\": \"Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations play a crucial role in scientific\\nresearch. Yet their computational cost often limits the timescales and system\\nsizes that can be explored. Most data-driven efforts have been focused on\\nreducing the computational cost of accurate interatomic forces required for\\nsolving the equations of motion. Despite their success, however, these machine\\nlearning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are still bound to small time-steps. In\\nthis work, we introduce TrajCast, a transferable and data-efficient framework\\nbased on autoregressive equivariant message passing networks that directly\\nupdates atomic positions and velocities lifting the constraints imposed by\\ntraditional numerical integration. We benchmark our framework across various\\nsystems, including a small molecule, crystalline material, and bulk liquid,\\ndemonstrating excellent agreement with reference MD simulations for structural,\\ndynamical, and energetic properties. Depending on the system, TrajCast allows\\nfor forecast intervals up to $30\\\\times$ larger than traditional MD time-steps,\\ngenerating over 15 ns of trajectory data per day for a solid with more than\\n4,000 atoms. By enabling efficient large-scale simulations over extended\\ntimescales, TrajCast can accelerate materials discovery and explore physical\\nphenomena beyond the reach of traditional simulations and experiments. An\\nopen-source implementation of TrajCast is accessible under\\nhttps://github.com/IBM/trajcast.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.comp-ph,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cs.LG,physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T07:14:32Z\"}"}
