They give rise to phenomena such as Anderson\\nlocalization in non-interacting systems, inhibiting transport. When\\ninteractions are introduced, the interplay with disorder becomes significantly\\nmore complex, and the conditions under which localization can be observed\\nremain an open question. In interacting bosonic systems, a Bose glass is\\nexpected to emerge at low energies as an insulating yet compressible state\\nwithout long-range phase coherence. While originally predicted to occur as a\\nground-state phase, more recent studies indicate that it exists at finite\\ntemperature. A key open challenge has been the direct observation of reduced\\nphase coherence in the Bose-glass regime. In this study, we utilize ultracold\\nbosonic atoms in a quantum-gas microscope to probe the emergence of the\\nBose-glass phase in a two-dimensional square lattice with a site-resolved,\\nreproducible disordered potential. We identify the phase through in-situ\\ndistribution and particle fluctuations, via a local measurement of the\\nEdwards-Anderson parameter. To measure the short-range phase coherence in the\\nBose glass, we employ Talbot interferometry in combination with\\nsingle-atom-resolved detection. Finally, by driving the system in and out of\\nthe Bose-glass phase, we observe signatures for non-ergodic behavior.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas,cond-mat.dis-nn,physics.atom-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T15:52:58Z\"}"}
