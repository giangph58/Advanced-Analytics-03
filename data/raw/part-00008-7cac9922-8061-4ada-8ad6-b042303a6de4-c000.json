Many methods have been developed and\\nsuccessfully applied in simulation and on quantum hardware. In this paper, we\\nestablish a connection between the iterative linear quadratic regulator and\\nquantum optimal control by adapting it to gate optimization of quantum systems.\\nWe include constraints on the controls and their derivatives to enable smoother\\npulses. We achieve high-fidelity simulation results for X and cross-resonance\\ngates on one- and two-qubit fixed-frequency transmons simulated with two and\\nthree levels.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T07:36:32Z\"}"}
