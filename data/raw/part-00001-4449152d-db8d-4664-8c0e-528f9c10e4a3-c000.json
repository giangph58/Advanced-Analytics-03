In one case (GRB 111209A/SN 2011kl) the associated\\nsupernova was classified as superluminous (SN 2011kl). The exceptional duration\\nof the observed gamma-ray prompt emission of GRB 111209A (about 7 hours) is\\nwidely considered key to unlocking the physics behind the still mysterious\\norigin of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe). We review the main observational\\nand theoretical findings that may link some ultra-long GRBs to SLSNe.\\nSpecifically, we examine notable events, the role of progenitors and host\\ngalaxies in shaping these phenomena, and focus on the proposed models. While a\\nmagnetar central engine is a plausible mechanism for both luminous and\\nlong-duration GRBs, a conclusive answer remains elusive, as alternative\\nexplanations are still viable. Further observational and theoretical work is\\nrequired to clarify progenitor pathways and explosion mechanisms, potentially\\nextending the classical GRB-SN connection to rare superluminous hypernovae.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T16:17:51Z\"}"}
