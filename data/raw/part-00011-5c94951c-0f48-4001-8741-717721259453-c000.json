{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00531v1\", \"title\": \"Superintuitionistic predicate logics of linear frames: undecidability\\n  with two individual variables\", \"summary\": \"The paper presents a solution to the long-standing question about the\\ndecidability of the two-variable fragment of the superintuitionistic predicate\\nlogic $\\\\mathbf{QLC}$ defined by the class of linear Kripke frames, which is\\nalso the `superintuitionistic' fragment of the modal predicate logic\\n$\\\\mathbf{QS4.3}$, under the G\\\\\\\"odel translation. We prove that the fragment is\\nundecidable ($\\\\Sigma^0_1$-complete). The result remains true for the positive\\nfragment, even with a single binary predicate letter and an infinite set of\\nunary predicate letters. Also, we prove that the logic defined by ordinal\\n$\\\\omega$ as a Kripke frame is not recursively enumerable (even both\\n$\\\\Sigma^0_1$-hard and $\\\\Pi^0_1$-hard) with the same restrictions on the\\nlanguage. The results remain true if we add also the constant domain condition.\\nThe proofs are based on two techniques: a modification of the method proposed\\nby M.Marx and M.Reynolds, which allows us to describe tiling problems using\\nnatural numbers rather than pairs of numbers within an enumeration of Cantor's,\\nand an idea of `double labeling' the elements from the domains, which allows us\\nto use only two individual variables in the proof when applying the former\\nmethod.\", \"main_category\": \"math.LO\", \"categories\": \"math.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T13:57:26Z\"}"}
