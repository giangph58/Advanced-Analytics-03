{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17418v1\", \"title\": \"Longitudinal Control for Autonomous Racing with Combustion Engine\\n  Vehicles\", \"summary\": \"Usually, a controller for path- or trajectory tracking is employed in\\nautonomous driving. Typically, these controllers generate high-level commands\\nlike longitudinal acceleration or force. However, vehicles with combustion\\nengines expect different actuation inputs. This paper proposes a longitudinal\\ncontrol concept that translates high-level trajectory-tracking commands to the\\nrequired low-level vehicle commands such as throttle, brake pressure and a\\ndesired gear. We chose a modular structure to easily integrate different\\ntrajectory-tracking control algorithms and vehicles. The proposed control\\nconcept enables a close tracking of the high-level control command. An\\nanti-lock braking system, traction control, and brake warmup control also\\nensure a safe operation during real-world tests. We provide experimental\\nvalidation of our concept using real world data with longitudinal accelerations\\nreaching up to $25 \\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{m}}{\\\\mathrm{s}^2}$. The experiments were\\nconducted using the EAV24 racecar during the first event of the Abu Dhabi\\nAutonomous Racing League on the Yas Marina Formula 1 Circuit.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.RO,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T10:21:28Z\"}"}
