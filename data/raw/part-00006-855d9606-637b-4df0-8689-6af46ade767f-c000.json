Under\\nappropriate uniformity and convergence conditions on the linear operators,\\nnonlinear drifts and initial data, we establish convergence of the associated\\nmild solution processes when lifted to a common state space. Our framework is\\napplied to the case where the limiting problem is a stochastic partial\\ndifferential equation whose linear part is a generalized Whittle-Mat\\\\'ern\\noperator on a manifold $\\\\mathcal{M}$, discretized by a sequence of graphs\\nconstructed from a point cloud. In this setting, we obtain\\ndiscrete-to-continuum convergence of solutions lifted to the spaces\\n$L^q(\\\\mathcal{M})$ for $q \\\\in [2,\\\\infty]$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:48:18Z\"}"}
