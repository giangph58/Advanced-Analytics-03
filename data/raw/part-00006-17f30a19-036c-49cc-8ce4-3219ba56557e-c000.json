{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16512v1\", \"title\": \"Criteria of Renormalizability in Effective Field Theories\", \"summary\": \"Any effective field theory relies on power counting rules that allow one to\\nperform a systematic expansion of calculated quantities in terms of some soft\\nscales. However, a naive power counting can be violated due to the presence of\\nvarious hard scales in a given scheme. A typical example of such a scale is an\\nultraviolet regulator. This issue is particularly challenging when the\\ninteraction is nonperturbative. The power counting is expected to be restored\\nin the course of renormalization, that is by redefining bare low-energy\\nconstants in the effective Lagrangian. Whether this procedure eventually leads\\nto a self-consistent framework is not a priory obvious. We discuss various\\ncriteria of renormalizability in application to nuclear chiral effective field\\ntheory and provide several instructive counterexamples.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T08:38:24Z\"}"}
