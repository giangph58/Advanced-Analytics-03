We prove that the eigenvalues are\\nentirely determined by those of the drift matrix, similarly to classical\\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck semigroups. This result is established using a\\nquasi-derivation property of the generator. Moreover, the same spectral\\nproperty holds for the adjoint of the induced generator. Finally, we show that\\nthese eigenvalues constitute the entire spectrum when the induced generator has\\na spectral gap.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T15:11:35Z\"}"}
