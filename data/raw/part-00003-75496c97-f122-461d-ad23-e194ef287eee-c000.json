{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03657v1\", \"title\": \"m-accretive extensions of Friedrichs operators\", \"summary\": \"The introduction of abstract Friedrichs operators in 2007-an\\noperator-theoretic framework for studying classical Friedrichs operators has\\nled to significant developments in the field, including results on\\nwell-posedness, multiplicity, and classification. More recently, the von\\nNeumann extension theory has been explored in this context, along with\\nconnections between abstract Friedrichs operators and skew-symmetric operators.\\n  In this work, we show that all m-accretive extensions of abstract Friedrichs\\noperators correspond precisely to those satisfying (V)-boundary conditions. We\\nalso establish a connection between the m-accretive extensions of abstract\\nFriedrichs operators and their skew-symmetric components. Additionally, the\\nthree equivalent formulations of boundary conditions are unified within a\\nsingle interpretive framework. To conclude, we discuss a constructive relation\\nbetween (V)- and (M)-boundary conditions and examine the multiplicity of the\\nassociated M-operators. We demonstrate our results on two examples, namely, the\\nfirst order ordinary differential equation on an interval, with various\\nboundary conditions, and the second-order elliptic partial differential\\nequation with Dirichlet boundary conditions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T16:01:47Z\"}"}
