{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10043v1\", \"title\": \"Instrumenting a Lake as a Wide-Field Gamma-ray Detector\", \"summary\": \"Ground-level particle detection has recently emerged as an extremely powerful\\napproach to TeV-PeV gamma-ray astronomy. The most successful observatories of\\nthis type, HAWC and LHAASO, utilise water-Cherenkov based detector units,\\nhoused in tanks or buildings. Here we explore the possibility of deploying\\nwater-Cherenkov detector units directly in to a natural or artificial lake.\\nPossible advantages include reduced cost and improved performance due to better\\nshielding. The lake concept has been developed as an option for the future\\nSouthern Wide-view Gamma-ray Observatory, and is now under consideration for a\\npossible future extension of the observatory, beyond its recently selected land\\nsite. We present results from prototypes operated in a custom built facility,\\nand concepts for full-scale array deployment and long-term operation.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:44:13Z\"}"}
