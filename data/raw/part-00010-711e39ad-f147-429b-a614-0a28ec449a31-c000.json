Its scalability and\\nsustainability hinge on consensus mechanisms balancing security and efficiency.\\nProof of Work (PoW), used by Bitcoin, ensures security through energy-intensive\\ncomputations but demands significant resources. Proof of Stake (PoS), as in\\nEthereum post-Merge, selects validators based on staked cryptocurrency,\\noffering energy efficiency but risking centralization from wealth\\nconcentration. With AI models straining computational resources, we propose\\nProof of Useful Intelligence (PoUI), a hybrid consensus mechanism. In PoUI,\\nworkers perform AI tasks like language processing or image analysis to earn\\ncoins, which are staked to secure the network, blending security with practical\\nutility. Decentralized nodes--job posters, market coordinators, workers, and\\nvalidators --collaborate via smart contracts to manage tasks and rewards.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T13:32:03Z\"}"}
