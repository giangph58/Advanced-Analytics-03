{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10295v1\", \"title\": \"Essay: A path for the construction of a Muon Collider\", \"summary\": \"Muons are elementary particles and provide cleaner collision events that can\\nexplore higher energies compared to composite particles like protons. Muons are\\nalso far heavier than their electron cousins, meaning that they emit less\\nsynchrotron radiation that effectively limits the energies of circular\\nelectron-positron colliders. These characteristics open up the possibility for\\na Muon Collider to surpass the direct energy reach of the Large Hadron Collider\\nwhile achieving unprecedented precision measurements of Standard Model\\nprocesses. In this Essay, after briefly summarizing the progress achieved so\\nfar, I identify important missing R&D steps and envision a compelling plan to\\nbring a Muon Collider to reality in the next two decades. A Muon Collider could\\nallow for the exploration of physics that is not available with current\\ntechnologies. For example, it may provide a way to study the Higgs boson\\ndirectly or probe new particles, including those related to dark matter or\\nother phenomena beyond the Standard Model.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T15:06:02Z\"}"}
