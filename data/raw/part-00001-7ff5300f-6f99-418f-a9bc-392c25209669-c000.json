{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17244v1\", \"title\": \"Service Rate Regions of MDS Codes & Fractional Matchings in\\n  Quasi-uniform Hypergraphs\", \"summary\": \"The service rate region (SRR) has emerged as a critical performance metric\\nfor distributed systems that store data redundantly. It measures the system's\\nability to serve multiple users concurrently. Mathematically, the SRR is a\\npolytope in R^k where each dimension corresponds to the service request rate of\\none of the k data objects. This paper focuses on systems employing a class of\\nMaximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes. For each code in the class, we\\ncharacterize the k axes intercept points of its SRR, and the smallest standard\\nsimplex that includes the SRR. We use these results to show that the SRR grows\\nwith the increasing number of systematic columns in the generator matrices. We\\nestablish a graph-theoretic framework associating this SRR problem with\\nfractional matchings in quasi-uniform hypergraphs. Identifying the SRR polytope\\nis equivalent to determining a particular image of the fractional-matching\\npolytope. We introduce a notion of Greedy Matching and show that it is\\nsufficient to focus on these matchings to characterize the SRR rather than the\\nentire matching polytope. With these tools, we determine the SRR of a large\\nsubset of the considered class of codes. Our results generalize previous\\ncharacterizations of systematic and non-systematic MDS-coded systems, offering\\na unified framework for analyzing service rate regions of codes.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.CO,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T04:44:37Z\"}"}
