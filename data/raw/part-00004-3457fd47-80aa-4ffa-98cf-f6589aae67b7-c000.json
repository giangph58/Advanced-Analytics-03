The architecture consists of two encoders and a mapping\\nnetwork that projects the two inputs into the latent space of StyleGAN2, which\\nfinally generates the output. The training is self-supervised from video\\nsequences of many individuals. Manual labeling is not required. Our model\\nenables the synthesis of random identities with controllable pose and\\nexpression. Close-to-real-time performance is achieved.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T15:29:41Z\"}"}
