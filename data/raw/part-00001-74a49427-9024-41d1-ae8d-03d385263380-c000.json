{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16533v1\", \"title\": \"SafeSpect: Safety-First Augmented Reality Heads-up Display for Drone\\n  Inspections\", \"summary\": \"Current tablet-based interfaces for drone operations often impose a heavy\\ncognitive load on pilots and reduce situational awareness by dividing attention\\nbetween the video feed and the real world. To address these challenges, we\\ndesigned a heads-up augmented reality (AR) interface that overlays in-situ\\ninformation to support drone pilots in safety-critical tasks. Through\\nparticipatory design workshops with professional pilots, we identified key\\nfeatures and developed an adaptive AR interface that dynamically switches\\nbetween task and safety views to prevent information overload. We evaluated our\\nprototype by creating a realistic building inspection task and comparing three\\ninterfaces: a 2D tablet, a static AR, and our adaptive AR design. A user study\\nwith 15 participants showed that the AR interface improved access to safety\\ninformation, while the adaptive AR interface reduced cognitive load and\\nenhanced situational awareness without compromising task performance. We offer\\ndesign insights for developing safety-first heads-up AR interfaces.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T08:59:05Z\"}"}
