{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20916v1\", \"title\": \"A generalization of Ramanujan's sum over finite groups\", \"summary\": \"Let $G$ be a finite group, and let $x \\\\in G$. Denote by $\\\\langle x^G \\\\rangle$\\nthe normal subgroup of $G$ generated by the conjugacy class of $x$, and define\\n$[x^G] := \\\\{ y \\\\in G : \\\\langle x^G \\\\rangle = \\\\langle y^G \\\\rangle \\\\}$. For any\\nirreducible character $\\\\chi$ of $G$, we define the character sum \\\\begin{align}\\nC_{\\\\chi}(x):= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\chi(\\\\textbf{1})} \\\\sum_{s \\\\in [x^G]} \\\\chi(s),\\\\nonumber\\n\\\\end{align} where $\\\\textbf{1}$ is the identity of $G$. In 1979, Babai proved\\nthat $C_{\\\\chi}(x)$ is an eigenvalue of the Cayley graph $\\\\text{Cay}(G, [x^G])$.\\nWhen $G$ is a finite cyclic group and $x$ is a generator, this sum coincides\\nwith the classical Ramanujan sum. Thus, $C_{\\\\chi}(x)$ can be viewed as a\\ngeneralization of the Ramanujan sum to arbitrary finite groups. A well-known\\nformula for the classical Ramanujan sum involves the M$\\\\ddot{\\\\text{o}}$bius\\nfunction and Euler's phi function. In this work, we derive an explicit formula\\nfor the character sum $C_{\\\\chi}(x)$, which extends the formula of classical\\nRamanujan sum to the context of finite groups. This generalization not only\\nenrich the theory of Ramanujan's sum but also provide new tools in spectral\\ngraph theory, representation theory, and algebraic number theory.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT,math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T16:35:01Z\"}"}
