{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12998v1\", \"title\": \"Automated Generation of Commit Messages in Software Repositories\", \"summary\": \"Commit messages are crucial for documenting software changes, aiding in\\nprogram comprehension and maintenance. However, creating effective commit\\nmessages is often overlooked by developers due to time constraints and varying\\nlevels of documentation skills. Our research presents an automated approach to\\ngenerate commit messages using Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language\\nProcessing (NLP) by developing models that use techniques such as Logistic\\nRegression with TF-IDF and Word2Vec, as well as more sophisticated methods like\\nLSTM. We used the dataset of code changes and corresponding commit messages\\nthat was used by Liu et al., which we used to train and evaluate ML/NLP models\\nand was chosen because it is extensively used in previous research, also for\\ncomparability in our study. The objective was to explore which ML/NLP\\ntechniques generate the most effective, clear, and concise commit messages that\\naccurately reflect the code changes. We split the dataset into training,\\nvalidation, and testing sets and used these sets to evaluate the performance of\\neach model using qualitative and quantitative evaluation methods. Our results\\nreveal a spectrum of effectiveness among these models, with the highest BLEU\\nscore achieved being 16.82, showcasing the models' capability in automating a\\nclear and concise commit message generation. Our paper offers insights into the\\ncomparative effectiveness of different machine learning models for automating\\ncommit message generation in software development, aiming to enhance the\\noverall practice of code documentation.
