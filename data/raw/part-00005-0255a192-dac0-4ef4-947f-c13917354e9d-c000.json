{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20863v1\", \"title\": \"Bayesian Optimization-based Tire Parameter and Uncertainty Estimation\\n  for Real-World Data\", \"summary\": \"This work presents a methodology to estimate tire parameters and their\\nuncertainty using a Bayesian optimization approach. The literature mainly\\nconsiders the estimation of tire parameters but lacks an evaluation of the\\nparameter identification quality and the required slip ratios for an adequate\\nmodel fit. Therefore, we examine the use of Stochastical Variational Inference\\nas a methodology to estimate both - the parameters and their uncertainties. We\\nevaluate the method compared to a state-of-the-art Nelder-Mead algorithm for\\ntheoretical and real-world application. The theoretical study considers\\nparameter fitting at different slip ratios to evaluate the required excitation\\nfor an adequate fitting of each parameter. The results are compared to a\\nsensitivity analysis for a Pacejka Magic Formula tire model. We show the\\napplication of the algorithm on real-world data acquired during the Abu Dhabi\\nAutonomous Racing League and highlight the uncertainties in identifying the\\ncurvature and shape parameters due to insufficient excitation. The gathered\\ninsights can help assess the acquired data's limitations and instead utilize\\nstandardized parameters until higher slip ratios are captured. We show that our\\nproposed method can be used to assess the mean values and the uncertainties of\\ntire model parameters in real-world conditions and derive actions for the tire\\nmodeling based on our simulative study.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T15:39:10Z\"}"}
