{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04550v1\", \"title\": \"An imageless magnetic resonance framework for fast and cost-effective\\n  decision-making\", \"summary\": \"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for non-invasive tissue\\nabnormality detection, yet hardware complexity, long acquisition times, and\\nhigh cost limit rapid screening and point-of-care use. We introduce Imageless\\nMagnetic Resonance Diagnosis (IMRD), a framework that bypasses k-space sampling\\nand image reconstruction by analyzing raw one-dimensional MR signals. IMRD\\nintegrates (i) optimized pulse sequences for time-domain contrast, (ii) minimal\\nlow-field hardware, and (iii) AI-driven pattern recognition to answer clinical\\nclosed queries and quantify lesion burden. As a proof of concept, we simulate\\nmultiple sclerosis lesions in silico within brain phantoms and deploy two\\napproximately 3 s protocols (single-spoke and gradientless). A 1D convolutional\\nneural network achieves AUC close to 0.95 for lesion detection and R2 close to\\n0.99 for volume estimation. We also perform robustness tests under reduced\\nsignal-to-noise ratio, partial signal omission, and relaxation-time\\nvariability. By reframing MR signals as direct diagnostic metrics, IMRD paves\\nthe way for fast, low-cost MR screening and monitoring in resource-limited\\nenvironments.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.med-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.med-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T16:31:26Z\"}"}
