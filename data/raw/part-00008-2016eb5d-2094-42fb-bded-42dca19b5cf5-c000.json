{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15856v1\", \"title\": \"FailLite: Failure-Resilient Model Serving for Resource-Constrained Edge\\n  Environments\", \"summary\": \"Model serving systems have become popular for deploying deep learning models\\nfor various latency-sensitive inference tasks. While traditional\\nreplication-based methods have been used for failure-resilient model serving in\\nthe cloud, such methods are often infeasible in edge environments due to\\nsignificant resource constraints that preclude full replication. To address\\nthis problem, this paper presents FailLite, a failure-resilient model serving\\nsystem that employs (i) a heterogeneous replication where failover models are\\nsmaller variants of the original model, (ii) an intelligent approach that uses\\nwarm replicas to ensure quick failover for critical applications while using\\ncold replicas, and (iii) progressive failover to provide low mean time to\\nrecovery (MTTR) for the remaining applications. We implement a full prototype\\nof our system and demonstrate its efficacy on an experimental edge testbed. Our\\nresults using 27 models show that FailLite can recover all failed applications\\nwith 175.5ms MTTR and only a 0.6% reduction in accuracy.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T12:52:11Z\"}"}
