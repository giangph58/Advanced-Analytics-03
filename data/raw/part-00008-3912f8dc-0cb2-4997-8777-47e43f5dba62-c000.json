We examine a layered superconductor and a two-component\\none-layer superconductor. We evaluate the field distribution in the presence of\\na half-flux quantum vortex with a kink structure in the phase space of gap\\nfunctions. We also examine the magnetic field distribution of a knot soliton\\nwhich is formulated in a two-component superconductor. We investigate the\\neffect of geometric constraints for multi-component superconductors, where the\\ngeometric constraint means that the system is compactified in one direction so\\nthat the current in this direction becomes vanishingly small. This corresponds\\nto the gauge fixing in this direction. An unconventional magnetic field\\ndistribution takes place; here the unconventional means that the magnetic field\\nis screened incompletely which would be called the anomalous Meissner effect.\\nWe argue that this anomalous behavior creates a massless gauge field.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T13:29:40Z\"}"}
