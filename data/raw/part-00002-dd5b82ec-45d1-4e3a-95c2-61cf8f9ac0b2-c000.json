{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11294v1\", \"title\": \"Transforming Resonance Fluorescence into Maximally Entangled Photon\\n  Pairs Using Minimal Resources\", \"summary\": \"Entanglement is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, describing two or\\nmore quantum systems that exhibit strong correlations beyond the classical\\nlimits at the expense of losing their individual properties. More recently, it\\nhas become a cornerstone of quantum technologies, promising revolutionary\\nadvancements in fields like quantum communication, sensing, and computation.\\nFor these reasons, the generation of technologically useful entangled states is\\nkey to progress in these fields. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that\\nresonance fluorescence from a weakly coupled two-level emitter can be\\ntransformed, using beam splitters, delay lines, and post-selection only, into a\\nstream of pairs of photons that are maximally entangled in the time-bin basis.\\nWe verify the entanglement via a CHSH-type Bell inequality test, yielding an\\nS-parameter of 2.80 \\\\pm 0.19, i.e., a clear 4{\\\\sigma} violation of the\\nclassical bound. Our results pave the way for realising efficient sources of\\nbandwidth-limited time-bin entangled photon pairs.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:33:14Z\"}"}
