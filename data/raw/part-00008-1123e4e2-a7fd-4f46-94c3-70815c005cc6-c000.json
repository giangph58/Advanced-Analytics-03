{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07079v1\", \"title\": \"SkillWeaver: Web Agents can Self-Improve by Discovering and Honing\\n  Skills\", \"summary\": \"To survive and thrive in complex environments, humans have evolved\\nsophisticated self-improvement mechanisms through environment exploration,\\nhierarchical abstraction of experiences into reuseable skills, and\\ncollaborative construction of an ever-growing skill repertoire. Despite recent\\nadvancements, autonomous web agents still lack crucial self-improvement\\ncapabilities, struggling with procedural knowledge abstraction, refining\\nskills, and skill composition. In this work, we introduce SkillWeaver, a\\nskill-centric framework enabling agents to self-improve by autonomously\\nsynthesizing reusable skills as APIs. Given a new website, the agent\\nautonomously discovers skills, executes them for practice, and distills\\npractice experiences into robust APIs. Iterative exploration continually\\nexpands a library of lightweight, plug-and-play APIs, significantly enhancing\\nthe agent's capabilities. Experiments on WebArena and real-world websites\\ndemonstrate the efficacy of SkillWeaver, achieving relative success rate\\nimprovements of 31.8% and 39.8%, respectively. Additionally, APIs synthesized\\nby strong agents substantially enhance weaker agents through transferable\\nskills, yielding improvements of up to 54.3% on WebArena. These results\\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of honing diverse website interactions into APIs,\\nwhich can be seamlessly shared among various web agents.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.CL,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T17:51:50Z\"}"}
