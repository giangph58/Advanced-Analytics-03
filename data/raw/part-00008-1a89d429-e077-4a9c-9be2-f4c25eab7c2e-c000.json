Indeed, grain boundaries\\nenhance the probability of phonon scattering events, which has been applied to\\ncontrol the thermal transport in a wide range of materials, including hard\\nmetals, diamond, oxides and 2D systems such as graphene. Here, we report the\\nopposite behavior in improper ferroelectric ErMnO3 polycrystals, where the\\nthermal conductivity decreases with increasing grain size. We attribute this\\nunusual relationship between heat transport and microstructure to phonon\\nscattering at ferroelectric domain walls. The domain walls are more densely\\npacked in larger grains, leading to an inversion of the classical\\ngrain-boundary-dominated transport behavior. Our findings open additional\\navenues for microstructural engineering of materials for thermoelectric and\\nthermal management applications, enabling simultaneous control over mechanical,\\nelectronic, and thermal properties.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T08:48:03Z\"}"}
