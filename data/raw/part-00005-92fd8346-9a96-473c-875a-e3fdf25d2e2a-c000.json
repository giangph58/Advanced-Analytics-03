{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11246v1\", \"title\": \"Respiratory Inhaler Sound Event Classification Using Self-Supervised\\n  Learning\", \"summary\": \"Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that affects millions of people\\nworldwide. While this condition can be managed by administering controller\\nmedications through handheld inhalers, clinical studies have shown low\\nadherence to the correct inhaler usage technique. Consequently, many patients\\nmay not receive the full benefit of their medication. Automated classification\\nof inhaler sounds has recently been studied to assess medication adherence.\\nHowever, the existing classification models were typically trained using data\\nfrom specific inhaler types, and their ability to generalize to sounds from\\ndifferent inhalers remains unexplored. In this study, we adapted the wav2vec\\n2.0 self-supervised learning model for inhaler sound classification by\\npre-training and fine-tuning this model on inhaler sounds. The proposed model\\nshows a balanced accuracy of 98% on a dataset collected using a dry powder\\ninhaler and smartwatch device. The results also demonstrate that re-finetuning\\nthis model on minimal data from a target inhaler is a promising approach to\\nadapting a generic inhaler sound classification model to a different inhaler\\ndevice and audio capture hardware. This is the first study in the field to\\ndemonstrate the potential of smartwatches as assistive technologies for the\\npersonalized monitoring of inhaler adherence using machine learning models.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.AS\", \"categories\": \"eess.AS,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:44:47Z\"}"}
