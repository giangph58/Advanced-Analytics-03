We here address induced small-scale flows in viscous\\nfluids or displacements in elastic solids in the vicinity of one such edge. For\\nthis purpose, we solve the underlying low-Reynolds-number flow equations for\\nincompressible fluids and the elasticity equations for linearly elastic,\\npossibly compressible solids. Technically speaking, we derive the associated\\nGreen's functions under confinement by two planar boundaries that meet at a\\nstraight edge. The two boundaries both feature no-slip or free-slip conditions,\\nor one of these two conditions per boundary. Previously, we solved the simpler\\ncase of the force being oriented parallel to the straight edge. Here, we\\ncomplement this solution by the more challenging case of the force pointing\\ninto a direction perpendicular to the edge. Together, these two cases provide\\nthe general solution. Specific situations in which our analysis may find\\napplication in terms of quantitative theoretical descriptions are particle\\nmotion in confined colloidal suspensions, dynamics of active microswimmers near\\nedges, or actuated distortions of elastic materials due to activated contained\\nfunctionalized particles.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T14:01:53Z\"}"}
