{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05277v1\", \"title\": \"Non-local charges from perturbed defects via SymTFT in 2d CFT\", \"summary\": \"We investigate non-local conserved charges in perturbed two-dimensional\\nconformal field theories from the point of view of the 3d SymTFT of the\\nunperturbed theory. In the SymTFT we state a simple commutation condition which\\nresults in a pair of compatible bulk and defect perturbations, such that the\\nperturbed line defects are conserved in the perturbed CFT. In other words, the\\nperturbed defects are rigidly translation invariant, and such defects form a\\nmonoidal category which extends the topological symmetries. As examples we\\nstudy the A-type Virasoro minimal models $M(p,q)$. Our formalism provides\\none-parameter families of commuting non-local conserved charges for\\nperturbations by a primary bulk field with Kac label $(1,2)$, $(1,3)$, or\\n$(1,5)$, which are the standard integrable perturbations of minimal models. We\\nfind solutions to the commutation condition also for other bulk perturbations,\\nsuch as $(1,7)$, and we contrast this with the existence of local conserved\\ncharges. There has been recent interest in the possibility that in certain\\ncases perturbations by fields such as $(1,7)$ can be integrable, and our\\nconstruction provides a new way in which integrability can be found without the\\nneed for local conserved charges.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,cond-mat.stat-mech,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T17:22:55Z\"}"}
