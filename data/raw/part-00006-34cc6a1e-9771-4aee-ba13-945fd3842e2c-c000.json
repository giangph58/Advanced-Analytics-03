We also describe compactifications\\n$X_G(N)$ of these curves when $R$ is a regular excellent Noetherian ring in\\nwhich $N$ is invertible, as well as construct the Hecke correspondences they\\nare endowed with. As an application, we show that the equations for $X_G(N)$\\nfound over base fields for $N=7,8,9,11,13$ (by Halberstadt--Kraus,\\nPoonen--Schaefer--Stoll, Chen and Fisher) are in fact valid over regular\\nexcellent Noetherian bases that are $\\\\mathbb{Q}$-algebras. Finally, we describe\\nin detail the equivalence of this construction with the point of view of Galois\\ntwists that these authors use.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT,math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:07:35Z\"}"}
