The magnetostriction of V$_6$O$_{13}$\\nalong the crystallographic $b$-axis has been measured in ultrahigh magnetic\\nfields up to 186 T at several temperatures in this work. The large negative\\nmagnetostriction as large as $\\\\Delta L / L \\\\sim10^{-3}$ was observed above 110\\nT below the transition temperature. Discussion based on experimental results\\nand the physical property of V$_6$O$_{13}$ suggests that the observed large\\nnegative magnetostriction corresponds to the collapse of V-V dimer molecular\\norbital (MO). This is the first case for direct observation of lattice change\\noriginating from the magnetic field-induced collapse of V-V dimer MO in\\nvanadium oxides. In addition, the $B$-$T$ phase diagram and the magnitude of\\nmagnetostriction indicate that the collapse of V-V dimer MO probably\\naccompanies the insulator-to-metal transition. A large hysteresis that is\\nlarger than 50 T was observed, which probably arises from the non-equilibrated\\ncross-correlation of such degrees of freedom as the charge, spin, and lattice.\\nComparison with the VO$_2$ case suggests the magnetic entropy of the remanent\\nparamagnetic spins in the insulating phase may play an important role for the\\nMIT in V$_6$O$_{13}$.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T11:01:35Z\"}"}
