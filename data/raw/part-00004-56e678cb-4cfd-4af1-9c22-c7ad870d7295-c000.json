Verification of models of\\nbiological and medical systems is a promising application of formal\\nverification. Human neural networks have recently been emulated and studied as\\na biological system. In this paper, we provide a model of some crucial neuronal\\ncircuits, called \\\"archetypes\\\", in the Coq Proof Assistant and prove properties\\nconcerning their dynamic behavior. Understanding the behavior of these modules\\nis crucial because they constitute the elementary building blocks of bigger\\nneuronal circuits. We consider seven fundamental archetypes (simple series,\\nseries with multiple outputs, parallel composition, positive loop, negative\\nloop, inhibition of a behavior, and contralateral inhibition), and prove an\\nimportant representative property for six of them. In building up to our model\\nof archetypes, we also provide a general model of \\\"neuronal circuits\\\", and\\nprove a variety of general properties about neurons and circuits. In addition,\\nwe have defined our model with a longer term goal of modelling the composition\\nof basic archetypes into larger networks, and structured our libraries with\\ndefinitions and lemmas useful for proving the properties in this paper as well\\nas those to be proved as future work.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LO\", \"categories\": \"cs.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:56:13Z\"}"}
