We present the broadly applicable CONCH\\n(CONformal CHangepoint localization) algorithm, which uses a matrix of\\nconformal p-values to produce a confidence interval for a (single) changepoint\\nunder the mild assumption that the pre-change and post-change distributions are\\neach exchangeable. We exemplify the CONCH algorithm on a variety of synthetic\\nand real-world datasets, including using black-box pre-trained classifiers to\\ndetect changes in sequences of images or text.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,eess.SP,stat.ME,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T04:27:52Z\"}"}
