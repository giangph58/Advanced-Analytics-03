{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10487v1\", \"title\": \"FLOSS: Free Lunch in Open-vocabulary Semantic Segmentation\", \"summary\": \"Recent Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) models extend the CLIP\\nmodel to segmentation while maintaining the use of multiple templates (e.g., a\\nphoto of <class>, a sketch of a <class>, etc.) for constructing class-wise\\naveraged text embeddings, acting as a classifier. In this paper, we challenge\\nthis status quo and investigate the impact of templates for OVSS. Empirically,\\nwe observe that for each class, there exist single-template classifiers\\nsignificantly outperforming the conventional averaged classifier. We refer to\\nthem as class-experts. Given access to unlabeled images and without any\\ntraining involved, we estimate these experts by leveraging the class-wise\\nprediction entropy of single-template classifiers, selecting as class-wise\\nexperts those which yield the lowest entropy. All experts, each specializing in\\na specific class, collaborate in a newly proposed fusion method to generate\\nmore accurate OVSS predictions. Our plug-and-play method, coined FLOSS, is\\northogonal and complementary to existing OVSS methods, offering a ''free\\nlunch'' to systematically improve OVSS without labels and additional training.\\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that FLOSS consistently boosts\\nstate-of-the-art methods on various OVSS benchmarks. Moreover, the selected\\nexpert templates can generalize well from one dataset to others sharing the\\nsame semantic categories, yet exhibiting distribution shifts. Additionally, we\\nobtain satisfactory improvements under a low-data regime, where only a few\\nunlabeled images are available.
