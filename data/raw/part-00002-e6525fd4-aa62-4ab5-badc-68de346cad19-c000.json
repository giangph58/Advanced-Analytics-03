We study the net\\naccretion of gas onto the disc region as a function of time and radius to\\nassess the feasibility of the so-called inside-out formation of galaxy discs.\\nWe found that most of the galaxies in our sample exhibit an inside-out disc\\ngrowth, with younger stellar populations preferentially formed in the outer\\nregions as accreted material turns into starts. This produces stable discs as\\nlong as late-time accretion is free from significant external perturbations.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:14:47Z\"}"}
