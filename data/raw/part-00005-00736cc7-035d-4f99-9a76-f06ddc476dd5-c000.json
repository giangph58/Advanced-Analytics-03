Nonlinearly coupled systems of\\nequations emerge from the semidirect product action where one set of dynamics\\ncan be considered in the frame of another. A monolithic energy-preserving\\ncontinuous Galerkin finite element method is used to study geodesic equations\\nassociated with the semidirect product of the diffeomorphism group on a circle\\nwith itself. Theoretically predicted peakon solutions are observed as an\\nemergent behaviour. In addition, complicated nonlinear transfers of energy are\\nassociated with the semidirect product coupling, where amongst various\\nnonlinear interactions, we observe coupled peakon behaviour. A mimetic (C-grid)\\nfinite difference method is used to study the geodesic flow of the semidirect\\nproduct of the volume preserving diffeomorphism group with itself, where\\nsimilar coupling behaviour is observed in the vorticity variables. We also\\ninvestigate coadjoint and Lie-Poisson structures in the context of geodesic\\nequations on semidirect product groups, where the underlying group is first\\nextended by central extension or semidirect product.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.PS\", \"categories\": \"nlin.PS\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T12:05:12Z\"}"}
