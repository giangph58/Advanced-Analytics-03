{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15979v1\", \"title\": \"Efficient Discovery of Motif Transition Process for Large-Scale Temporal\\n  Graphs\", \"summary\": \"Understanding the dynamic transition of motifs in temporal graphs is\\nessential for revealing how graph structures evolve over time, identifying\\ncritical patterns, and predicting future behaviors, yet existing methods often\\nfocus on predefined motifs, limiting their ability to comprehensively capture\\ntransitions and interrelationships. We propose a parallel motif transition\\nprocess discovery algorithm, PTMT, a novel parallel method for discovering\\nmotif transition processes in large-scale temporal graphs. PTMT integrates a\\ntree-based framework with the temporal zone partitioning (TZP) strategy, which\\npartitions temporal graphs by time and structure while preserving lossless\\nmotif transitions and enabling massive parallelism. PTMT comprises three\\nphases: growth zone parallel expansion, overlap-aware result aggregation, and\\ndeterministic encoding of motif transitions, ensuring accurate tracking of\\ndynamic transitions and interactions. Results on 10 real-world datasets\\ndemonstrate that PTMT achieves speedups ranging from 12.0$\\\\times$ to\\n50.3$\\\\times$ compared to the SOTA method.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DB\", \"categories\": \"cs.DB,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T15:30:04Z\"}"}
