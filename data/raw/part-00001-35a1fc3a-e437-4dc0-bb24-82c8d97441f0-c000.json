{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19952v1\", \"title\": \"On Stopping Times of Power-one Sequential Tests: Tight Lower and Upper\\n  Bounds\", \"summary\": \"We prove two lower bounds for stopping times of sequential tests between\\ngeneral composite nulls and alternatives. The first lower bound is for the\\nsetting where the type-1 error level $\\\\alpha$ approaches zero, and equals\\n$\\\\log(1/\\\\alpha)$ divided by a certain infimum KL divergence, termed\\n$\\\\operatorname{KL_{inf}}$. The second lower bound applies to the setting where\\n$\\\\alpha$ is fixed and $\\\\operatorname{KL_{inf}}$ approaches 0 (meaning that the\\nnull and alternative sets are not separated) and equals $c\\n\\\\operatorname{KL_{inf}}^{-1} \\\\log \\\\log \\\\operatorname{KL_{inf}}^{-1}$ for a\\nuniversal constant $c > 0$. We also provide a sufficient condition for matching\\nthe upper bounds and show that this condition is met in several special cases.\\nGiven past work, these upper and lower bounds are unsurprising in their form;\\nour main contribution is the generality in which they hold, for example, not\\nrequiring reference measures or compactness of the classes.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,cs.LG,stat.ML,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:22:54Z\"}"}
