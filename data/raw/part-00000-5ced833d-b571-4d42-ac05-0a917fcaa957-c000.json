{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13079v1\", \"title\": \"Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Conflicting Evidence\", \"summary\": \"Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly employing\\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve the factuality of their\\nresponses. However, in practice, these systems often need to handle ambiguous\\nuser queries and potentially conflicting information from multiple sources\\nwhile also suppressing inaccurate information from noisy or irrelevant\\ndocuments. Prior work has generally studied and addressed these challenges in\\nisolation, considering only one aspect at a time, such as handling ambiguity or\\nrobustness to noise and misinformation. We instead consider multiple factors\\nsimultaneously, proposing (i) RAMDocs (Retrieval with Ambiguity and\\nMisinformation in Documents), a new dataset that simulates complex and\\nrealistic scenarios for conflicting evidence for a user query, including\\nambiguity, misinformation, and noise; and (ii) MADAM-RAG, a multi-agent\\napproach in which LLM agents debate over the merits of an answer over multiple\\nrounds, allowing an aggregator to collate responses corresponding to\\ndisambiguated entities while discarding misinformation and noise, thereby\\nhandling diverse sources of conflict jointly. We demonstrate the effectiveness\\nof MADAM-RAG using both closed and open-source models on AmbigDocs -- which\\nrequires presenting all valid answers for ambiguous queries -- improving over\\nstrong RAG baselines by up to 11.40% and on FaithEval -- which requires\\nsuppressing misinformation -- where we improve by up to 15.80% (absolute) with\\nLlama3.3-70B-Instruct. Furthermore, we find that RAMDocs poses a challenge for\\nexisting RAG baselines (Llama3.3-70B-Instruct only obtains 32.60 exact match\\nscore). While MADAM-RAG begins to address these conflicting factors, our\\nanalysis indicates that a substantial gap remains especially when increasing\\nthe level of imbalance in supporting evidence and misinformation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T16:46:11Z\"}"}
