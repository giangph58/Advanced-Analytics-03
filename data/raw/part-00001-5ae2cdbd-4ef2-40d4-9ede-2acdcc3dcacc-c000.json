{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10432v1\", \"title\": \"Invariance Matters: Empowering Social Recommendation via Graph Invariant\\n  Learning\", \"summary\": \"Graph-based social recommendation systems have shown significant promise in\\nenhancing recommendation performance, particularly in addressing the issue of\\ndata sparsity in user behaviors. Typically, these systems leverage Graph Neural\\nNetworks (GNNs) to capture user preferences by incorporating high-order social\\ninfluences from observed social networks. However, existing graph-based social\\nrecommendations often overlook the fact that social networks are inherently\\nnoisy, containing task-irrelevant relationships that can hinder accurate user\\npreference learning. The removal of these redundant social relations is\\ncrucial, yet it remains challenging due to the lack of ground truth. In this\\npaper, we approach the social denoising problem from the perspective of graph\\ninvariant learning and propose a novel method, Social Graph Invariant\\nLearning(SGIL). Specifically,SGIL aims to uncover stable user preferences\\nwithin the input social graph, thereby enhancing the robustness of graph-based\\nsocial recommendation systems. To achieve this goal, SGIL first simulates\\nmultiple noisy social environments through graph generators. It then seeks to\\nlearn environment-invariant user preferences by minimizing invariant risk\\nacross these environments. To further promote diversity in the generated social\\nenvironments, we employ an adversarial training strategy to simulate more\\npotential social noisy distributions. Extensive experimental results\\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SGIL.
