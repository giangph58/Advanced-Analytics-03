They include the cases of Weighted and Deflated GMRES for\\na linear system Ax = b. In particular, the case of positive definite A is\\nconsidered. The well-known polynomial bounds are generalized to the cases\\nconsidered, and then reduced to solving a min-max problem on rectangles on the\\ncomplex plane. Several approaches are considered and compared. The new bounds\\ncan be improved by using specific deflation spaces and preconditioners. This in\\nturn accelerates the convergence of GMRES. Numerical examples illustrate the\\nresults obtained.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T06:45:34Z\"}"}
