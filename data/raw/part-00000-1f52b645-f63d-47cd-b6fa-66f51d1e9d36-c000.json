By aggregating point cloud sequences at the feature level and\\nregularizing the feature extraction and aggregation process, MFSeg reduces\\ncomputational overhead while maintaining high accuracy. Moreover, by employing\\na lightweight MLP-based point decoder, our method eliminates the need to\\nupsample redundant points from past frames. Experiments on the nuScenes and\\nWaymo datasets show that MFSeg outperforms existing methods, demonstrating its\\neffectiveness and efficiency.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T13:46:10Z\"}"}
