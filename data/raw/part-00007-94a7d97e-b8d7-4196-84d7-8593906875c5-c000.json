{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06811v1\", \"title\": \"Hybrid CNN with Chebyshev Polynomial Expansion for Medical Image\\n  Analysis\", \"summary\": \"Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality\\nworldwide, with early and accurate diagnosis playing a pivotal role in\\nimproving patient outcomes. Automated detection of pulmonary nodules in\\ncomputed tomography (CT) scans is a challenging task due to variability in\\nnodule size, shape, texture, and location. Traditional Convolutional Neural\\nNetworks (CNNs) have shown considerable promise in medical image analysis;\\nhowever, their limited ability to capture fine-grained spatial-spectral\\nvariations restricts their performance in complex diagnostic scenarios. In this\\nstudy, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning architecture that incorporates\\nChebyshev polynomial expansions into CNN layers to enhance expressive power and\\nimprove the representation of underlying anatomical structures. The proposed\\nChebyshev-CNN leverages the orthogonality and recursive properties of Chebyshev\\npolynomials to extract high-frequency features and approximate complex\\nnonlinear functions with greater fidelity. The model is trained and evaluated\\non benchmark lung cancer imaging datasets, including LUNA16 and LIDC-IDRI,\\nachieving superior performance in classifying pulmonary nodules as benign or\\nmalignant. Quantitative results demonstrate significant improvements in\\naccuracy, sensitivity, and specificity compared to traditional CNN-based\\napproaches. This integration of polynomial-based spectral approximation within\\ndeep learning provides a robust framework for enhancing automated medical\\ndiagnostics and holds potential for broader applications in clinical decision\\nsupport systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T12:02:56Z\"}"}
