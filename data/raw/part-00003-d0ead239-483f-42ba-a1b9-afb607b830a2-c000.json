This study is a replication (different data, same analysis)\\nof a study on Alzheimer's disease [28] which studied robustness of logistic\\nregression (LR) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) across patient sexes.\\nWe explore sex bias in skin cancer detection, using the PAD-UFES-20 dataset\\nwith LR trained on handcrafted features reflecting dermatological guidelines\\n(ABCDE and the 7-point checklist), and a pre-trained ResNet-50 model. We\\nevaluate these models in alignment with [28]: across multiple training datasets\\nwith varied sex composition to determine their robustness. Our results show\\nthat both the LR and the CNN were robust to the sex distributions, but the\\nresults also revealed that the CNN had a significantly higher accuracy (ACC)\\nand area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) for male patients\\nthan for female patients. We hope these findings to contribute to the growing\\nfield of investigating potential bias in popular medical machine learning\\nmethods. The data and relevant scripts to reproduce our results can be found in\\nour Github.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T17:31:46Z\"}"}
