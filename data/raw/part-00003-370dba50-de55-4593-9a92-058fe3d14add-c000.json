{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00636v1\", \"title\": \"Fully passive quantum random number generation with untrusted light\", \"summary\": \"Quantum random number generators (QRNGs) harness the inherent\\nunpredictability of quantum mechanics to produce true randomness. Yet, in many\\noptical implementations, the light source remains a potential vulnerability -\\nsusceptible to deviations from ideal behavior and even adversarial\\neavesdropping. Source-device-independent (SDI) protocols address this with a\\npragmatic strategy, by removing trust assumptions on the source, and instead\\nrely on realistic modelling and characterization of the measurement device. In\\nthis work, we enhance an existing SDI-QRNG protocol by eliminating the need for\\na perfectly balanced beam splitter within the trusted measurement device, which\\nis an idealized assumption made for the simplification of security analysis. We\\ndemonstrate that certified randomness can still be reliably extracted across a\\nwide range of beam-splitting ratios, significantly improving the protocol's\\npracticality and robustness. Using only off-the-shelf components, our\\nimplementation achieves real-time randomness generation rates of 0.347 Gbps. We\\nalso experimentally validate the protocol's resilience against adversarial\\nattacks and highlight its self-testing capabilities. These advances mark a\\nsignificant step toward practical, lightweight, high-performance,\\nfully-passive, and composably secure QRNGs suitable for real-world deployment.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T16:21:50Z\"}"}
