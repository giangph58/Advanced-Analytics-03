The numerous supernova remnants (SNRs),\\nHII regions and other exotic transients make it a perfect laboratory for\\nstudying stellar evolution and the interstellar medium (ISM). Its proximity\\nprovides a linear resolution of 17 pc/arcsec, enabling decadal-time-scale\\nvariability and morphology studies of the tens of compact radio sources. In\\nthis proceedings, we describe new techniques developed in the last ten years\\nthat provide deeper, more robust imaging, enable in-band spectral index\\nmapping, and allow wider fields of view to be imaged to find new radio sources.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T12:42:34Z\"}"}
