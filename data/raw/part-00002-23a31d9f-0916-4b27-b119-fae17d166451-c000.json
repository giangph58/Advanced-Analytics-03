Depending on their initial orientation, the\\nminimal mean FPT for active particles to reach the boundary can both decrease\\nand increase relative to the passive counterpart. The associated optimal\\nresetting rates depend non-trivially on the initial distance to the boundary\\ndue to the intricate interplay of resetting, rotational Brownian noise, and\\nactive motion.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,cond-mat.stat-mech,physics.bio-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T10:36:32Z\"}"}
