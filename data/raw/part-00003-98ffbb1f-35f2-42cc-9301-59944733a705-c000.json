{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24299v1\", \"title\": \"Shape Expressions with Inheritance\", \"summary\": \"We formally introduce an inheritance mechanism for the Shape Expressions\\nlanguage (ShEx). It is inspired by inheritance in object-oriented programming\\nlanguages, and provides similar advantages such as reuse, modularity, and more\\nflexible data modelling. Using an example, we explain the main features of the\\ninheritance mechanism. We present its syntax and formal semantics. The\\nsemantics is an extension of the semantics of ShEx 2.1. It also directly yields\\na validation algorithm as an extension of the previous ShEx validation\\nalgorithms, while maintaining the same algorithmic complexity.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DB\", \"categories\": \"cs.DB,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:42:44Z\"}"}
