We prove a\\nquantitative Schmidt-type counting theorem under the following constraints: (1)\\nthe points of interest are restricted to $E$; (2) the denominators of the\\n``shifted'' rational approximations are drawn exclusively from $\\\\mathcal{A}$.\\nOur result extends the work of Pollington, Velani, Zafeiropoulos, and Zorin\\n(2022) to the matrix setting, advancing the study of Diophantine approximation\\non fractals. Moreover, it strengthens the equidistribution property of the\\nsequence $(A_n{\\\\bf x})_{n\\\\in\\\\N}$ for $\\\\mu$-almost every ${\\\\bf x}\\\\in E.$\\nApplications include the normality of vectors and shrinking target problems on\\nfractal sets.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T11:53:50Z\"}"}
