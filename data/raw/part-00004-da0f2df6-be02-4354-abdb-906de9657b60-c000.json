{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01821v1\", \"title\": \"How to Reliably Measure Carrier Mobility in Highly Resistive Lead Halide\\n  Perovskites with Photo-Hall Experiment\", \"summary\": \"Mobility measurements in highly resistive methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI)\\nare challenging due to high impedance, ion drift, and low mobility. We show\\nthat we can address the challenge using intensity-dependent photo-Hall\\nmeasurements. The key is an improved photo-Hall setup, which enables reliable\\nHall measurements in the dark and under low-intensity illumination. By tuning\\nthe illumination over four orders of magnitude, we get the additional\\ninformation to simultaneously extract hole mobility, electron mobility, and\\nbackground doping. For the first time, we show that a MAPI single crystal,\\nexhibiting n-type behaviour in the dark, can show p-type behaviour under light\\ndue to the difference in hole and electron mobility. The data partly explains\\nthe variability in mobility reported in the literature. We show that one can\\nerroneously extract any mobility from 0 to 25 cm2/Vs if we restrict the\\nexperiment to a small range of illumination intensities. For our MAPI (310)\\ncrystal, the measured hole and electron mobility is 40 cm2/Vs and 25.5 cm2/Vs,\\nrespectively.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:28:22Z\"}"}
