Abreu et al. [J. Comb. Theory, Ser. B. 98 (2008)\\n432--442] conjectured that $K_{3,3}$, the Heawood graph and the Pappus graph\\nare the only essentially 4-edge-connected pseudo 2-factor isomorphic cubic\\nbipartite graphs. This conjecture was disproved by Goedgebeur [Discr. Appl.\\nMath. 193 (2015) 57--60] who constructed a counterexample $\\\\mathcal{G}$ (of\\ngirth 6) on 30 vertices. Using a computer search, he also showed that this is\\nthe only counterexample up to at least 40 vertices and that there are no\\ncounterexamples of girth greater than 6 up to at least 48 vertices.\\n  In this manuscript, we show that the Gray graph -- which has 54 vertices and\\ngirth 8 -- is also a counterexample to the pseudo 2-factor isomorphic graph\\nconjecture. Next to the graph $\\\\mathcal{G}$, this is the only other known\\ncounterexample. Using a computer search, we show that there are no smaller\\ncounterexamples of girth 8 and show that there are no other counterexamples up\\nto at least 42 vertices of any girth. Moreover, we also verified that there are\\nno further counterexamples among the known censuses of symmetrical graphs.\\n  Recall that a graph is 2-factor Hamiltonian if all of its 2-factors are\\nHamiltonian cycles. As a by-product of the computer searches performed for this\\npaper, we have verified that the $2$-factor Hamiltonian conjecture of Funk et\\nal. [J. Comb. Theory, Ser. B. 87(1) (2003) 138--144], which is still open,\\nholds for cubic bipartite graphs of girth at least 8 up to 52 vertices, and up\\nto 42 vertices for any girth.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,cs.DM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T13:59:43Z\"}"}
