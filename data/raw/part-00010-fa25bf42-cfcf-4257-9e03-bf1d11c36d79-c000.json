{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03370v1\", \"title\": \"Effective Field Theory of Superconductivity\", \"summary\": \"A field theory of a Schr\\\\\\\"{o}dinger type complex scalar field of Cooper pair,\\na U(1) gauge field of electromagnetism, and a neutral scalar field of gapless\\nacoustic phonon is proposed for superconductivity of s-waves. Presence of the\\ngapless neutral scalar field is justified as low energy residual acoustic\\nphonon degrees in the context of effective field theory. The critical coupling\\nof quartic self-interaction of complex scalar field is computed from a 1-loop\\nlevel interaction balance between the repulsion mediated by massive degree of\\nthe U(1) gauge field and the attraction mediated by massive Higgs degree, in\\nthe static limit. The obtained net attraction or repulsion in perturbative\\nregime matches the type I or II superconductivity, respectively. We find the\\nnew critical coupling of cubic Yukawa type interaction between the neutral and\\ncomplex scalar fields from another tree level interaction balance between the\\nCoulomb repulsion mediated by massless degree of the U(1) gauge field and the\\nattraction mediated by the gapless neutral scalar field, in the static limit.\\nSuperconducting phase is realized at or in the vicinity of this critical\\ncoupling. A huge discrepancy between the propagation speeds of photon and\\nphonon gives a plausible explanation on low critical temperatures in\\nconventional superconductors.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.str-el,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T09:41:36Z\"}"}
