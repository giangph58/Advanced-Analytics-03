{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00282v1\", \"title\": \"A Unifying Framework for Robust and Efficient Inference with\\n  Unstructured Data\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents a general framework for conducting efficient and robust\\ninference on parameters derived from unstructured data, which include text,\\nimages, audio, and video. Economists have long incorporated data extracted from\\ntexts and images into their analyses, a practice that has accelerated with\\nadvancements in deep neural networks. However, neural networks do not\\ngenerically produce unbiased predictions, potentially propagating bias to\\nestimators that use their outputs. To address this challenge, we reframe\\ninference with unstructured data as a missing structured data problem, where\\nstructured data are imputed from unstructured inputs using deep neural\\nnetworks. This perspective allows us to apply classic results from\\nsemiparametric inference, yielding valid, efficient, and robust estimators\\nbased on unstructured data. We formalize this approach with MARS (Missing At\\nRandom Structured Data), a unifying framework that integrates and extends\\nexisting methods for debiased inference using machine learning predictions,\\nlinking them to a variety of older, familiar problems such as causal inference.\\nWe develop robust and efficient estimators for both descriptive and causal\\nestimands and address challenges such as inference using aggregated and\\ntransformed predictions from unstructured data. Importantly, MARS applies to\\ncommon empirical settings that have received limited attention in the existing\\nliterature. Finally, we reanalyze prominent studies that use unstructured data,\\ndemonstrating the practical value of MARS.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.EM\", \"categories\": \"econ.EM,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T04:11:25Z\"}"}
