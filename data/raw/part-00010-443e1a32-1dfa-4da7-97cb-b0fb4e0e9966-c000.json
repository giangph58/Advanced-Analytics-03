{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19897v1\", \"title\": \"The Dust Echo Emission of Fast Blue Optical Transients and Application\\n  to the Near-Infrared Excess of AT 2018cow\", \"summary\": \"A near-infrared (NIR) excess has been discovered in the emission of the\\nrepresentative fast blue optical transient (FBOT): AT 2018cow. It was suggested\\nthat this NIR excess could be emitted by the dust surrounding the source and,\\nthus, could provide a probe into the nature of its progenitor. We develop a\\nmodel to describe the influence of the FBOT emission on the environmental dust\\nand, as a result, a dust-free evaporation cavity can be formed on a timescale\\nof one day. Outside this cavity, the surviving dust grains can have different\\nsize distributions at different distances to the source. With such a special\\ndust environment, we fit the multi-wavelength light curves of AT 2018cow by\\ntaking into account the evolutionary dust echo of the FBOT emission. It is\\nfound that the dust temperature can vary with time along with the evolution of\\nthe irradiating FBOT emission. Even at a fixed time, the dust temperature can\\nbe distributed in a wide range rather than having only a unique value.\\nFurthermore, both the mass of the dust shell and its distance to the FBOT are\\nfound to be much larger than those derived with a direct empirical fitting of\\nthe NIR spectra but without considering the evolutionary relationship between\\nthe spectra.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:28:44Z\"}"}
