It optimizes\\ntrajectories by sampling control sequences and averaging them. However, a key\\nissue with MPPI is the non-smoothness of the optimal control sequence, leading\\nto oscillations in systems like fixed-wing aerial vehicles (FWVs). Existing\\nsolutions use post-hoc smoothing, which fails to bound control derivatives.\\nThis paper introduces a new approach: we add a projection filter $\\\\pi$ to\\nminimally correct control samples, ensuring bounds on control magnitude and\\nhigher-order derivatives. The filtered samples are then averaged using MPPI,\\nleading to our $\\\\pi$-MPPI approach. We minimize computational overhead by using\\na neural accelerated custom optimizer for the projection filter. $\\\\pi$-MPPI\\noffers a simple way to achieve arbitrary smoothness in control sequences. While\\nwe focus on FWVs, this projection filter can be integrated into any MPPI\\npipeline. Applied to FWVs, $\\\\pi$-MPPI is easier to tune than the baseline,\\nresulting in smoother, more robust performance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T08:11:02Z\"}"}
