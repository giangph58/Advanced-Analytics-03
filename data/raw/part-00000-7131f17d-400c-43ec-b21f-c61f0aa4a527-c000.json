{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00271v1\", \"title\": \"Dissipative qutrit-mediated stable charging\", \"summary\": \"In this work, we propose a stable charging scheme mediated by a dissipative\\nthree-level system, which allows a unidirectional energy flow from the external\\npower source to a finite-dimensional quantum battery. By virtue of the\\ndissipation, the battery avoids the spontaneous discharging induced by the\\ntime-reversal symmetry in any unitary charging scheme. Irrespective to the\\ninitial state, the battery can be eventually stabilized at the\\nmaximal-ergotropy state as long as the charger-battery interaction is present.\\nWe use a Dyson series of Lindbladian superoperator to obtain an effective\\nmaster equation to describe the battery dynamics and extract the optimization\\ncondition for charging efficiency. Also it proves that the Fermi's golden rule\\ncan adapt to the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We justify the outstanding\\nperformance of our charging scheme when applied to the finite-size system with\\na uniform energy ladder operator, the large spin battery, and the truncated\\nharmonic oscillator battery.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T03:35:56Z\"}"}
