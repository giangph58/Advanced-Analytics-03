In this work, we focus on\\nstructural repeats, patterns that arise from the repetition of hierarchical\\nrelations within sequential data, and develop a candidate computational model\\nof how humans detect and understand such structural repeats. Based on a\\nweighted deduction system, our model infers the minimal generative process of a\\ngiven sequence in the form of a Template program, a formalism that enriches the\\ncontext-free grammar with repetition combinators. Such representation\\nefficiently encodes the repetition of sub-computations in a recursive manner.\\nAs a proof of concept, we demonstrate the expressiveness of our model on short\\nsequences from music and action planning. The proposed model offers broader\\ninsights into the mental representations and cognitive mechanisms underlying\\nhuman pattern recognition.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T10:08:28Z\"}"}
