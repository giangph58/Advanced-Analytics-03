Most existing methods\\napproach this problem exclusively in the audio domain, typically using online\\ntime warping (OLTW) techniques on incoming audio and an audio representation of\\nthe score. Audio OLTW techniques have seen incremental improvements both in\\nfeatures and model heuristics which reached a performance plateau in the past\\nten years. We argue that converting and representing the performance in the\\nsymbolic domain -- thereby transforming music tracking into a symbolic task --\\ncan be a more effective approach, even when the domain transformation is\\nimperfect. Our music tracking system combines two real-time components: one\\nhandling audio-to-note transcription and the other a novel symbol-level tracker\\nbetween transcribed input and score. We compare the performance of this mixed\\naudio-symbolic approach with its equivalent audio-only counterpart, and\\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms the latter in terms of both precision,\\ni.e., absolute tracking error, and robustness, i.e., tracking success.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SD\", \"categories\": \"cs.SD,eess.AS\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T09:21:23Z\"}"}
