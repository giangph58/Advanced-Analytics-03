{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19702v1\", \"title\": \"Security of a secret sharing protocol on the Qline\", \"summary\": \"Secret sharing is a fundamental primitive in cryptography, and it can be\\nachieved even with perfect security. However, the distribution of shares\\nrequires computational assumptions, which can compromise the overall security\\nof the protocol. While traditional Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) can maintain\\nsecurity, its widespread deployment in general networks would incur prohibitive\\ncosts. In this work, we present a quantum protocol for distributing additive\\nsecret sharing of 0, which we prove to be composably secure within the Abstract\\nCryptography framework. Moreover, our protocol targets the Qline, a recently\\nproposed quantum network architecture designed to simplify and reduce the cost\\nof quantum communication. Once the shares are distributed, they can be used to\\nsecurely perform a wide range of cryptographic tasks, including standard\\nadditive secret sharing, anonymous veto, and symmetric key establishment.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T11:56:45Z\"}"}
