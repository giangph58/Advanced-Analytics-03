The method can handle general\\ndistributional changes and is based on an isolation technique preventing the\\nconsideration of intervals that contain more than one change-point, which\\nenhances the estimation accuracy. As stopping rules, we propose both\\nthresholding and the optimization of an information criterion. In the scenarios\\ntested, which cover a broad range of change types, NPID outperforms the state\\nof the art. An R implementation is provided.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T07:28:05Z\"}"}
