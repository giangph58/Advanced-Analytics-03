By varying the microwave frequency, external\\nbias magnetic field, and in-plane wave vector, in addition to observing the\\ndipole-exchange spin waves excited by parallel parametric pumping, we further\\nobserve broadband spin wave excitation within the dipole-exchange spin wave\\nspectrum. This broadband excitation results from the combined effects of\\nparallel and perpendicular parametric pumping, induced by irregularities in the\\nexcitation geometry, as well as magnon-magnon scattering arising from the\\nabsence of certain spin wave modes. Our findings offer new insights into the\\nmechanisms of energy dissipation and relaxation processes caused by spin wave\\nexcitation in magnetic devices operating at high power.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T10:18:46Z\"}"}
