{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15191v1\", \"title\": \"Aerodynamic Control of Laminar Separation on a Wall-Bounded Airfoil at\\n  Transitional Reynolds Numbers\", \"summary\": \"Experiments were conducted in a low-turbulence wind tunnel to investigate the\\nefficacy of localised acoustic forcing upon the dynamics and stability of the\\nflow on a cambered, wall-bounded airfoil over a range of Reynolds numbers (Re)\\nwhere the flow state can switch between two limits -- a low-lift state (SI)\\nwhere separation continues beyond the trailing edge and a high-lift state (SII)\\nwhere the separated flow is closed off to form a laminar separation bubble. The\\nswitching between SI and SII can occur close to a critical angle of attack\\n($\\\\alpha_{\\\\textrm{crit}}$) which varies with $\\\\textrm{Re}$. The most effective\\nforcing frequencies are found at a constant value of a rescaled Strouhal\\nnumber, $\\\\textrm{St}^* = \\\\textrm{St}/\\\\textrm{Re}^{1/2}= 0.027$, which indicates\\nthat though the primary unstable modes of the separated shear layer are of the\\ninviscid, Kelvin-Helmholtz type, these modes are seeded by length scales that\\noriginate in the laminar (viscous) boundary layer. The most effective chordwise\\nforcing location varies with $\\\\textrm{St}/\\\\textrm{Re}^{1/2}$ and incidence\\nangle, $\\\\alpha$, and is always upstream of the separation point. Although the\\nboundary layer flows are far from two-dimensional, forcing at a fixed chord\\nlocation across all spanwise locations is effective in controlling the SI --\\nSII transition. Strategies for active and passive feedback control are\\nsuggested.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T16:01:41Z\"}"}
