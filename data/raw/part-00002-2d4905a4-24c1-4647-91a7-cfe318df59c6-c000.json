{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04498v1\", \"title\": \"Uncovering Key Features for Model-Driven Engineering of Complex\\n  Performance Indicators: A Scoping Review\", \"summary\": \"This paper addresses challenges of designing and managing Complex Performance\\nIndicators (CPI), which amalgamate individual indicators to measure latent, yet\\ncrucial business factors like customer satisfaction or sustainability indices.\\nDespite their significant value, designing and managing CPI is intricate; they\\nevolve with rapidly changing business contexts and present comprehension and\\nexplanation challenges for end-users. Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) emerges as\\na potent solution to overcome these hurdles and ensure CPI adoption, though its\\napplication to CPI remains an understudied research area. While prior efforts\\ntargeted specific CPI modeling objectives, a comprehensive overview of\\nliterature advancements is lacking. This study addresses this gap by conducting\\na scoping review yielding dual outcomes: (1) a comprehensive mapping of\\nmodeling features in the literature and (2) a comparative analysis of the\\ncoverage offered by the modeling frameworks. These outcomes enhance CPI\\nunderstanding in academic and practitioner circles and offer insights for\\nfuture MDE CPI advancements.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE,cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T15:20:52Z\"}"}
