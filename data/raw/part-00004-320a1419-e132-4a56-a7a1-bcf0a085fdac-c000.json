We\\nidentify conditions under which partial permutational symmetry emerges and\\nexploit it to group qubits into collective multi-level degrees of freedom,\\nwhich we term ''superspins.'' These superspins obey a generalized angular\\nmomentum algebra, reducing the relevant Hilbert space dimension from\\nexponential to polynomial. Using this framework, we efficiently compute\\nmany-body superradiant dynamics in large arrays of qubits coupled to waveguides\\nand ring resonators, showing that $\\\\unicode{x2014}$ unlike in conventional\\nDicke superradiance $\\\\unicode{x2014}$ the total spin length is not conserved.\\nAt long times, dark states become populated. We identify configurations where\\nthese states exhibit metrologically useful entanglement. Our approach enables\\nexact treatment of complex dissipative dynamics beyond the fully symmetric\\nlimit and provides a rigorous benchmark for approximate numerical methods.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T15:22:59Z\"}"}
