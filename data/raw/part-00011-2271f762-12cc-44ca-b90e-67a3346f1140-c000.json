{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15809v1\", \"title\": \"A Line Graph-Based Framework for Identifying Optimal Routing Paths in\\n  Decentralized Exchanges\", \"summary\": \"Decentralized exchanges, such as those employing constant product market\\nmakers (CPMMs) like Uniswap V2, play a crucial role in the blockchain ecosystem\\nby enabling peer-to-peer token swaps without intermediaries. Despite the\\nincreasing volume of transactions, there remains limited research on\\nidentifying optimal trading paths across multiple DEXs. This paper presents a\\nnovel line-graph-based algorithm (LG) designed to efficiently discover\\nprofitable trading routes within DEX environments. We benchmark LG against the\\nwidely adopted Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm under a linear routing\\nscenario, encompassing platforms such as Uniswap, SushiSwap, and PancakeSwap.\\nExperimental results demonstrate that LG consistently identifies trading paths\\nthat are as profitable as, or more profitable than, those found by DFS, while\\nincurring comparable gas costs. Evaluations on Uniswap V2 token graphs across\\ntwo temporal snapshots further validate LG's performance. Although LG exhibits\\nexponential runtime growth with respect to graph size in empirical tests, it\\nremains viable for practical, real-world use cases. Our findings underscore the\\npotential of the LG algorithm for industrial adoption, offering tangible\\nbenefits to traders and market participants in the DeFi space.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.CP\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.CP,cs.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T11:45:49Z\"}"}
