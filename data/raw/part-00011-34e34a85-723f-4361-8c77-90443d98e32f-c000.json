The RSD is a candidate sensor to\\nbe used in future tracking detectors with the objective of obtaining '4D'\\ntracking, where timing information can be used along with spatial hits during\\ntrack finding. 4D tracking will be an essential part of any future lepton or\\nhadron collider and may even be feasible at the HL-LHC. For applications at\\nhadron colliders, RSD sensors must be able to operate in high fluence\\nenvironments in order to provide 4D tracking. However, the effects of radiation\\non RSDs have not been extensively studied. In this study, RSDs were irradiated\\nto $1.0$, $2.0$, and $3.5 \\\\times 10^{15}$~cm$^{-2}$ (1~MeV neutron equivalents)\\nwith both protons and neutrons. The sensors were then characterized\\nelectrically to study the acceptor removal and, for the first time in this\\ndoping concentration range, the donor removal. Then, the Transient Current\\nTechnique was used to begin investigating the signal charge sharing after\\nirradiation. The results suggest an interesting trend between acceptor and\\ndonor removal, which is worthy of further study and could assist in improving\\nradiation hardness of Low Gain Avalanche Diodes (LGADs).\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:07:20Z\"}"}
