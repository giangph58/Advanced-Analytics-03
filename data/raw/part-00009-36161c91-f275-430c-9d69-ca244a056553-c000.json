However, CD of chiral\\nnatural materials is inherently constrained owing to molecular symmetry and\\nthermodynamic stability. Recently, artificially engineered metasurfaces\\nincorporating chiral quasi-bound states in the continuum (Q-BICs) have emerged\\nas a promising solution, which enables near-unity CD responses. However, their\\ncurrent designs heavily rely on complex three-dimensional geometries, posing\\nsignificant challenges for integration with planar on-chip platforms. To\\naddress the stringent challenges, we demonstrate a truly planar metasurface\\nthat achieves giant intrinsic chiral responses by utilizing a chiral Q-BIC\\ndominated by out-of-plane toroidal dipoles (Tz). With deep-subwavelength\\n({\\\\lambda}/20) thickness, our metasurface exhibits outstanding intrinsic CD\\nvalues in both simulations (>0.90) and experiments (~0.80). Moreover, in\\ncontrast to previous electric or magnetic chiral Q-BICs, the toroidal Q-BIC\\nproduces a rapidly switching CD response - transitioning sharply between\\npositive and negative giant CD values within ~0.2 GHz, and the switching is\\nhighly sensitive to small oblique incidence of opposite angles. Therefore, our\\nscheme provides a planar platform for studying chiral light-matter interactions\\ninvolving toroidal dipoles, important for future development of polarization-\\nand angle-sensitive photonic and optoelectronic devices.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T07:07:31Z\"}"}
