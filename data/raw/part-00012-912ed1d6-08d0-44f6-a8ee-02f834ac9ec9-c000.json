{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20483v1\", \"title\": \"Merger-Driven Turbulence and Coherent Transport in the Intracluster\\n  Medium\", \"summary\": \"The distribution of metals and temperature in the intracluster medium (ICM)\\nprovides key insights into galaxy cluster evolution, revealing information\\nabout chemical enrichment and heating and cooling processes, respectively. To\\naccess this information, it is crucial to understand the transport processes in\\nthe ICM. Here, we systematically study the transport mechanisms in the ICM with\\ntracer particle resimulations of the Omega500 cosmological hydrosimulation,\\nusing a sample of four galaxy clusters of comparable masses but different mass\\nassembly histories. Through the analysis of particle pair dispersion\\nstatistics, we find a time-dependent scaling index linked to the cluster's\\ndynamical state. It reaches or exceeds Richardson scaling briefly during major\\nmergers but remains much lower in relaxed clusters. We identify a coherent\\ntransport mode during major mergers that causes directional flow in the ICM.\\nAlthough coherent transport can move particles to outer regions, the particles\\ntransported to the cluster outskirts compose only a small fraction of the\\ndensity there; thus the anisotropy it creates in the overall density\\ndistribution is limited. Moreover, strong turbulence generated by mergers\\nquickly disperses these particles, further limiting this effect. We also\\nprovide useful statistics on the radial evolution of the ICM and the fraction\\nof particles that ever reached the inner regions as a function of radius. Our\\nresults show that major mergers primarily drive particle transport, linking ICM\\ntransport to merger-driven dynamics, and highlighting the interplay between\\ncoherent and turbulent transport.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T07:23:29Z\"}"}
