{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12263v1\", \"title\": \"A complete theory of the Clifford commutant\", \"summary\": \"The Clifford group plays a central role in quantum information science. It is\\nthe building block for many error-correcting schemes and matches the first\\nthree moments of the Haar measure over the unitary group -a property that is\\nessential for a broad range of quantum algorithms, with applications in\\npseudorandomness, learning theory, benchmarking, and entanglement distillation.\\nAt the heart of understanding many properties of the Clifford group lies the\\nClifford commutant: the set of operators that commute with $k$-fold tensor\\npowers of Clifford unitaries. Previous understanding of this commutant has been\\nlimited to relatively small values of $k$, constrained by the number of qubits\\n$n$. In this work, we develop a complete theory of the Clifford commutant. Our\\nfirst result provides an explicit orthogonal basis for the commutant and\\ncomputes its dimension for arbitrary $n$ and $k$. We also introduce an\\nalternative and easy-to-manipulate basis formed by isotropic sums of Pauli\\noperators. We show that this basis is generated by products of permutations\\n-which generate the unitary group commutant- and at most three other operators.\\nAdditionally, we develop a graphical calculus allowing a diagrammatic\\nmanipulation of elements of this basis. These results enable a wealth of\\napplications: among others, we characterize all measurable magic measures and\\nidentify optimal strategies for stabilizer property testing, whose success\\nprobability also offers an operational interpretation to stabilizer entropies.\\nFinally, we show that these results also generalize to multi-qudit systems with\\nprime local dimension.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T17:21:34Z\"}"}
