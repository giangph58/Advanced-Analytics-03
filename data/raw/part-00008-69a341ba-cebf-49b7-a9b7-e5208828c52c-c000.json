{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01712v1\", \"title\": \"Method for Mitigating Attention to Inappropriate Content Based on\\n  Attention Dynamics Model\", \"summary\": \"The expansion of the attention economy has led to the growing issue of\\ninappropriate content being posted by profit-driven users. Previous\\ncountermeasures against inappropriate content have relied on moderation, which\\nraises ethical concerns, or information diffusion control, which requires\\nconsidering larger scale networks, including general users. This study proposes\\nan imitation strategy as an intervention method that does not rely on\\nmoderation and focuses on a relatively smaller scale competitive network of\\ninformation disseminators rather than the entire social network. The imitation\\nstrategy is a novel approach that utilizes increased competition among\\ninformation disseminators through imitation to reduce attention to\\ninappropriate content. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations,\\nI demonstrate that the imitation strategy is more effective when nodes with\\nhigher eigenvector centrality are selected as targets and nodes with lower\\neigenvector centrality are chosen as imitators.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SI\", \"categories\": \"cs.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T13:20:25Z\"}"}
