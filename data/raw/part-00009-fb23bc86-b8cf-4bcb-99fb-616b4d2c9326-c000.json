{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16666v1\", \"title\": \"Anomalies in Muon-Induced Neutron Emissions from Pb\", \"summary\": \"This paper analyses neutron multiplicity spectra from massive targets at\\ndepths of 3, 40, 210, 583, 1166, and 4000 m.w.e. The measurements, conducted\\nbetween 2001 and 2024, utilised three experimental setups with either 14 or 60\\nHe-3 neutron detectors and lead (Pb) targets weighing 306, 565, or 1134 kg. The\\ntotal acquisition time exceeded six years. When available, the acquired spectra\\nwere compared with Monte Carlo simulations. Our data challenges the practice of\\napproximating the muon-induced neutron multiplicity spectra with one power-law\\nfunction $k \\\\times m^{-p}$, where m is the multiplicity, k is the depth-related\\nparameter decreasing with overburden, and p is the slope parameter that remains\\nunchanged with depth. Instead, we see the emergence of a second component. It\\nis evident already in the muon-suppressed spectrum collected on the surface and\\ndominates the spectra at 1166 and 4000 m.w.e. In addition, we see indications\\nof a possible structure in the second component that resembles emissions of\\napproximately 74, 106, 143, and 214 neutrons from the target. Since the anomaly\\nvaries only slightly with depth, it is not directly correlated with the muon\\nflux. We propose new underground measurements employing low-cost, large-area,\\nposition-sensitive neutron counters to verify and investigate the observed\\nanomalies and ascertain their origin.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T12:35:20Z\"}"}
