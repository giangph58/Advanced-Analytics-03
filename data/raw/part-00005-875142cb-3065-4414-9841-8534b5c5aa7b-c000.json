The scattering process is studied\\ntheoretically, which yields the relative speed and the impact parameter\\ndependence of the scattering angle. The viscosity is derived from the Boltzmann\\nequation and its temperature dependence is plotted. We also perform the direct\\nsimulation Monte Carlo to check the validity of the theory.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T06:26:46Z\"}"}
