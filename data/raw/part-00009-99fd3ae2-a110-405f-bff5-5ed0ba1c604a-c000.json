This\\nstudy investigates the $^{50}$Ti$+^{244}$Pu and $^{50}$Ti$+^{251}$Cf reactions\\nas pathways to form superheavy elements (SHEs) 116 (Livermorium) and 120,\\nrespectively. Using the dinuclear system model, key parameters such as fusion\\nprobability and fusion cross section were calculated. These findings were used\\nto examine neutron emission and survival probability through a statistical\\napproach. The reaction $^{50}$Ti$+^{244}$Pu is explored as a continuation of\\nexperimental efforts to extend the known isotopic range of element 116, while\\nthe $^{50}$Ti$+^{251}$Cf reaction represents a frontier for the synthesis of\\nelement 120. The role of shell effects, excitation energy, and angular momentum\\non the production and stability of these nuclei is discussed. The results\\nprovide theoretical predictions to guide future experimental efforts aimed at\\nadvancing our understanding of the island of stability and the limits of\\nnuclear existence.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T10:08:57Z\"}"}
