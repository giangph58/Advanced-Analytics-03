This electron spin-torsion coupling\\nlacked both an experimental validation and a theoretical modeling. Here, the\\nfirst experimental observation of the electron spin-torsion coupling is\\nreported analyzing the pure rotational spectrum at millimeter wavelengths of\\nthe CH$_3$CO radical, a $^2\\\\Sigma$ open-shell molecule displaying an internal\\nrotation of its methyl group. To account for this coupling, a specific\\nHamiltonian incorporating the rotational, torsional, and electronic degrees of\\nfreedom is developed and allows us to reproduce the experimental spectrum. The\\npresent demonstration of the electron spin-torsion coupling will undoubtedly be\\nkey to future investigations of large open-shell molecules exhibiting a complex\\ninternal dynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T11:56:39Z\"}"}
