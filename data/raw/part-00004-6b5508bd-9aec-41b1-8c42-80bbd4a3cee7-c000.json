{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10241v1\", \"title\": \"Cross-correlations between X-ray clusters and the general galaxy\\n  population\", \"summary\": \"This study presents highly precise measurements of the cross-correlation\\nbetween volume-limited galaxy samples from the DESI legacy survey catalogue and\\nX-ray selected galaxy clusters from eROSITA, allowing for detailed analysis\\nacross redshift and color. Two key findings emerge. First, the cluster-galaxy\\ncross-correlation, when split into quiescent and star-forming galaxies,\\ncontains significant information about the infall, feedback, and quenching\\nprocesses of blue cloud galaxies in massive environments. These results align\\nwell with existing galaxy evolution models for higher stellar masses\\n($\\\\log_{10}(M^*[M_\\\\odot]) > 10.75$), though the red fraction may be slightly\\nunderestimated in the intermediate mass range ($10.25 <\\n\\\\log_{10}(M^*[M_\\\\odot])< 10.75$). Second, the integral of the cross-correlation\\nwithin 500 kpc enables a model-independent measurement of the red sequence and\\nits scatter in clusters, providing a robust alternative to existing\\nred-sequence calibration methods without requiring spectroscopic redshifts or\\nclassifications of galaxies. Similar analyses on upcoming photometric surveys\\nas Euclid and LSST together with spectroscopic samples like 4MOST and DESI\\nshould lead to a significant increase in the signal-to-noise ratio and in\\nparticular at small separations.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T14:03:56Z\"}"}
