{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17415v1\", \"title\": \"Structural design and multiple magnetic orderings of the intergrowth\\n  compound Eu$_2$CuMn$_2$P$_3$\", \"summary\": \"We report the design, synthesis, crystal structure, and physical properties\\nof a layered intergrowth compound, Eu$_2$CuMn$_2$P$_3$. The structure of\\nEu$_2$CuMn$_2$P$_3$ features an alternating arrangement of hexagonal EuCuP\\nblock layers and trigonal EuMn$_2$P$_2$ block layers, interconnected through\\nshared Eu planes. This structural hybridization leads to multiple magnetic\\norderings in Eu$_2$CuMn$_2$P$_3$: weak antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of Mn\\nat $T_\\\\mathrm{N}^\\\\mathrm{Mn}$ = 80 K, AFM ordering of Eu at\\n$T_\\\\mathrm{N}^\\\\mathrm{Eu}$ = 29 K, a spin-reorientation transition at\\n$T_\\\\mathrm{SR}$ = 14.5 K, and weak ferromagnetism below\\n$T_\\\\mathrm{N}^\\\\mathrm{Mn}$. The spin configurations at different temperature\\nregions were discussed based on the calculations of magnetic energies for\\nvarious collinear arrangements. Resistivity measurements reveal a pronounced\\ntransition peak at $T_\\\\mathrm{N}^\\\\mathrm{Eu}$, which is suppressed in the\\npresence of a magnetic field, resulting in a significant negative\\nmagnetoresistance effect. The computed semimetallic band structure,\\ncharacterized by a small density of states at the Fermi level, aligns well with\\nexperimental observations. The successful synthesis of Eu$_2$CuMn$_2$P$_3$ and\\nits fascinating magnetic properties highlight the effectiveness of our\\nblock-layer design strategy. By assembling magnetic block layers of compounds\\nwith compatible crystal symmetries and closely matched lattice parameters, this\\napproach opens exciting avenues for discovering layered materials with unique\\nmagnetic behaviors.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T10:15:40Z\"}"}
