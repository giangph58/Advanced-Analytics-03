{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04506v1\", \"title\": \"Main-oval auroral emission from a T6 brown dwarf: observations,\\n  modeling, and astrometry\", \"summary\": \"From a series of 5 GHz VLBA radio observations taken over 1-yr span, we\\npresent the detection of compact highly-polarized radio emission from the T6\\nbrown dwarf WISE J112254.72+255022.2 compatible with electron cyclotron maser\\nemission. Both the total and polarized lightcurves show variability in\\ncorrespondence with a rotation period of 1.95+/-0.03 hr. Comparison with models\\nindicates that the quasi-steady radio emission of this brown dwarf is produced\\nin circumpolar auroral rings, with remarkable similarity to the main-oval\\nauroras in Jupiter. We have detected a large 100% polarized flare in one of the\\nVLBA epochs (2022.82) which may imply the existence of active longitudes in the\\nauroral rings with a non-axisymmetric beaming cone radiation pattern, similar\\nto the dusk/dawn asymmetries seen in the Jovian radio emissions. We also\\npresent a high-precision astrometric analysis of the sky motion of WISE\\nJ112254.72+255022.2, resulting in revised values of proper motion and parallax\\nwith an improvement in precision of one order of magnitude. The common\\nkinematics of WISE J112254.72+255022.2 with its wide companion, the M-dwarf LHS\\n302, is confirmed with submilliarcsecond precision, suggesting that this brown\\ndwarf may have formed by gravitational fragmentation of the outer part of a\\nprotostellar disc around LHS 302. The astrometric analysis imposes very tight\\nbounds to the presence of low-mass companions around WISE J112254.72+255022.2,\\nruling out objects more massive than Saturn. Our results strengthen the analogy\\nbetween radio emitting brown dwarfs and the magnetized planets of our solar\\nsystem.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T15:27:13Z\"}"}
