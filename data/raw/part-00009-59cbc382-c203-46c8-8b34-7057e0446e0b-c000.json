This is done mainly by solving the nonlinear Schrodinger equation\\nusing the split step algorithm. In a nonlinear media, dispersive effects exist\\nsimultaneously with nonlinear effects. Refractive index dependence on intensity\\nresults in optical Kerr effect which causes narrowing of transmitted pulses by\\ninducing self-phase modulation while second order group velocity dispersion\\ncauses the pulses to spread. In this project, group velocity dispersion is\\ndiscussed followed by self-phase modulation. These individually detrimental\\neffects are shown to combine beneficially for propagation of pulses here.\\nGaussian pulse is studied and propagated by using them as input in to the\\nnonlinear Schrodinger equation. The split step algorithm is described in depth.\\nExplanation of each step is included along with the relevant equations defining\\nthese steps.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T12:17:43Z\"}"}
