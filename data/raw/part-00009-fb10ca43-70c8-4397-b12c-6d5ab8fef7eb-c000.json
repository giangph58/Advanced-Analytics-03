{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06627v1\", \"title\": \"FACT: Multinomial Misalignment Classification for Point Cloud\\n  Registration\", \"summary\": \"We present FACT, a method for predicting alignment quality (i.e.,\\nregistration error) of registered lidar point cloud pairs. This is useful e.g.\\nfor quality assurance of large, automatically registered 3D models. FACT\\nextracts local features from a registered pair and processes them with a point\\ntransformer-based network to predict a misalignment class. We generalize prior\\nwork that study binary alignment classification of registration errors, by\\nrecasting it as multinomial misalignment classification. To achieve this, we\\nintroduce a custom regression-by-classification loss function that combines the\\ncross-entropy and Wasserstein losses, and demonstrate that it outperforms both\\ndirect regression and prior binary classification. FACT successfully classifies\\npoint-cloud pairs registered with both the classical ICP and GeoTransformer,\\nwhile other choices, such as standard point-cloud-quality metrics and\\nregistration residuals are shown to be poor choices for predicting\\nmisalignment. On a synthetically perturbed point-cloud task introduced by the\\nCorAl method, we show that FACT achieves substantially better performance than\\nCorAl. Finally, we demonstrate how FACT can assist experts in correcting\\nmisaligned point-cloud maps. Our code is available at\\nhttps://github.com/LudvigDillen/FACT_for_PCMC.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T07:01:57Z\"}"}
