The SOTI character should endow WTe2\\nmultilayer crystals with topologically protected helical states at its hinges,\\nand, indeed, 1D states have been detected thanks to Josephson interferometry.\\nHowever, the immunity to backscattering conferred to those states by their\\nhelical nature has so far not been tested. To probe the topological protection\\nof WTe2 edge states, we have fabricated Superconducting Quantum Interference\\nDevices (SQUIDs) in which the supercurrent through a junction on the crystal\\nedge interferes with the supercurrent through a junction in the bulk of the\\ncrystal. We find behaviors ranging from a Symmetric SQUID pattern to asymmetric\\nSQUID patterns, including one in which the modulation by magnetic field reveals\\na sawtooth-like supercurrent versus phase relation for the edge junction,\\ndemonstrating that the supercurrent at the edge is carried by ballistic\\nchannels over 600 nm, a tell-tale sign of the SOTI character of WTe2.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T09:43:04Z\"}"}
