HIV self-testing offers a means to overcome barriers\\nassociated with routine laboratory-based testing but carries a risk of\\nincreasing incidence if replacement effects reduce overall test sensitivity.\\nMethods: A linearized four-compartment HIV transmission model was applied to 38\\nEnding the HIV Epidemic (EHE) priority jurisdictions. A threshold testing level\\nwas defined to counterbalance potential negative effects from reduced self-test\\nsensitivity. Both the percentage of self-tests and the overall testing rate\\nwere varied to quantify 10-year changes in HIV incidence. Results: Substantial\\nheterogeneity emerged across districts. Incidence reductions exceeded 5 percent\\nin some areas, while others saw only minor effects. Jurisdictions with higher\\nbaseline testing displayed an elevated risk of increased incidence from\\nsubstitution of laboratory-based testing with self-tests. In contrast, a\\nderived Awareness Reproduction Number, capturing transmissions attributable to\\nundiagnosed infection, strongly correlated with the magnitude of possible\\nincidence declines. Conclusions: Local epidemiological context is pivotal in\\ndetermining the risks and benefits of HIV self-testing. Jurisdictions with\\nrobust testing systems may face a greater likelihood of inadvertently raising\\nincidence, whereas those with a high number of individuals stand to achieve\\nnotable transmission reductions. Tailoring self-testing strategies based on\\njurisdiction-specific conditions can maximize public health benefits while\\nminimizing unintended consequences.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T11:43:28Z\"}"}
