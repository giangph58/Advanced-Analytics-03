To this end, we replace the commonly\\nused eikonal equation with the heat method, carrying over to the neural domain\\nwhat has long been standard practice for computing distances on discrete\\nsurfaces. This yields two convex optimization problems for whose solution we\\nemploy neural networks: We first compute a neural approximation of the\\ngradients of the unsigned distance field through a small time step of heat flow\\nwith weighted point cloud densities as initial data. Then we use it to compute\\na neural approximation of the SDF. We prove that the underlying variational\\nproblems are well-posed. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our\\nmethod provides state-of-the-art surface reconstruction and consistent SDF\\ngradients. Furthermore, we show in a proof-of-concept that it is accurate\\nenough for solving a PDE on the zero-level set.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.LG,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:13:54Z\"}"}
