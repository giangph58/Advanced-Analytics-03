At the initial stage of the\\nsimulation, all the particles are kept neutral. As the number of EUV pulses\\nincreases over time, the population of neutral particle decreases faster at the\\nexpense of negatively charged particle generation outside the beam location.\\nHowever, a small population (< 1%) of neutral particles become positively\\ncharged due to EUV photon interaction within the beam area and remains in\\nsteady state over time. The critical pulse numbers have been estimated for\\ndifferent nanometer size particles above which most of the particles outside\\nthe beam locations become negatively charged: smaller is the particle size,\\nlarger is the critical pulse number.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:28:28Z\"}"}
