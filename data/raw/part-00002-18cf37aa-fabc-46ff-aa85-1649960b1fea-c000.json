However, existing approaches often fall\\nshort in simultaneously addressing three core challenges: Sentiment Cue\\nPerception (SCP), Multimodal Information Misalignment (MIM), and Semantic Noise\\nElimination (SNE). To overcome these limitations, we propose DASCO\\n(\\\\textbf{D}ependency Structure \\\\textbf{A}ugmented \\\\textbf{Sco}ping Framework),\\na fine-grained scope-oriented framework that enhances aspect-level sentiment\\nreasoning by leveraging dependency parsing trees. First, we designed a\\nmulti-task pretraining strategy for MABSA on our base model, combining\\naspect-oriented enhancement, image-text matching, and aspect-level\\nsentiment-sensitive cognition. This improved the model's perception of aspect\\nterms and sentiment cues while achieving effective image-text alignment,\\naddressing key challenges like SCP and MIM. Furthermore, we incorporate\\ndependency trees as syntactic branch combining with semantic branch, guiding\\nthe model to selectively attend to critical contextual elements within a\\ntarget-specific scope while effectively filtering out irrelevant noise for\\naddressing SNE problem. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets across\\nthree subtasks demonstrate that DASCO achieves state-of-the-art performance in\\nMABSA, with notable gains in JMASA (+3.1\\\\% F1 and +5.4\\\\% precision on\\nTwitter2015).\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.MM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:05:09Z\"}"}
