In this study, we use\\nfirst-principles calculations and Boltzmann transport theory to explore the\\nstrain effect on the TE performance of the 2D vdW heterobilayer\\nMoTe$_{2}$/PtS$_{2}$. A strong Rashba spin-splitting is observed in the valence\\nband, resulting in an increase in the Seebeck coefficient for p-type. The\\nlattice thermal conductivity of MoTe$_{2}$/PtS$_{2}$ is remarkably low about of\\n0.6 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at $T = 300$ K due to large anharmonic scattering.\\nFurthermore, biaxial strain enhances the power factor (PF) by introducing band\\nconvergence. At a strain of 2\\\\%, the optimal PF for the n-type material reaches\\n170 $\\\\mu$W/cmK$^{2}$, indicating approximately 84.78\\\\% increase compared to the\\nunstrained state (92 $\\\\mu$W/cmK$^{2}$). Given the low lattice thermal\\nconductivity, the optimized figure of merit $ZT$ achieves up to 0.88 at 900 K\\nfor n-type. Our findings indicate that MoTe$_{2}$/PtS$_{2}$ is a highly\\npromising candidate for 2D heterobilayer TE materials, owing to its strong\\nRashba splitting and significant anharmonicity.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T14:57:24Z\"}"}
