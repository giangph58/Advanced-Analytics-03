{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04392v1\", \"title\": \"Predicting Road Surface Anomalies by Visual Tracking of a Preceding\\n  Vehicle\", \"summary\": \"A novel approach to detect road surface anomalies by visual tracking of a\\npreceding vehicle is proposed. The method is versatile, predicting any kind of\\nroad anomalies, such as potholes, bumps, debris, etc., unlike direct\\nobservation methods that rely on training visual detectors of those cases. The\\nmethod operates in low visibility conditions or in dense traffic where the\\nanomaly is occluded by a preceding vehicle. Anomalies are detected\\npredictively, i.e., before a vehicle encounters them, which allows to\\npre-configure low-level vehicle systems (such as chassis) or to plan an\\navoidance maneuver in case of autonomous driving. A challenge is that the\\nsignal coming from camera-based tracking of a preceding vehicle may be weak and\\ndisturbed by camera ego motion due to vibrations affecting the ego vehicle.\\nTherefore, we propose an efficient method to compensate camera pitch rotation\\nby an iterative robust estimator. Our experiments on both controlled setup and\\nnormal traffic conditions show that road anomalies can be detected reliably at\\na distance even in challenging cases where the ego vehicle traverses imperfect\\nroad surfaces. The method is effective and performs in real time on standard\\nconsumer hardware.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T13:17:05Z\"}"}
