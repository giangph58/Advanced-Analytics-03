{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23998v1\", \"title\": \"Relevance of the Computational Models of Bacterial Interactions in the\\n  simulation of Biofilm Growth\", \"summary\": \"This study explores the application of elongated particle interaction models,\\ntraditionally used in liquid crystal phase research, in the context of early\\nbacterial biofilm development. Through computer simulations, using an agent\\nbased model, of the repulsive and attractive of Kihara models and Hertz\\ninteraction model, we investigate the possibilities and limitations for\\nmodelling biofilm formation and growth. Our approach focuses on understanding\\nhow mechanical forces due to the interaction between cells, in addition to\\ngrowth and diffusive parameters, influence the formation of complex bacterial\\ncommunities. By comparing such force models, we evaluate their impact on the\\nstructural properties of bacterial microcolonies. The results indicate that,\\nalthough the specific force model has some effect on biofilm properties, the\\nintensity of the interaction between bacteria is the most important\\ndeterminant. This study highlights the importance of properly selecting\\ninteraction strength in simulations to obtain realistic representations of\\nbiofilm growth, and suggests which adapted models of rod-shaped bacterial\\nsystems may offer a valid approach to study the dynamics of complex biofilms.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,physics.bio-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T12:21:26Z\"}"}
