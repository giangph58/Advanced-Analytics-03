The AMD MI300A is an exception, since it sports both\\nCPU and GPU cores in a single package, all backed by the same type of HBM\\nmemory. In this paper we analyze the performance of Permutational Multivariate\\nAnalysis of Variance (PERMANOVA), a non-parametric method that tests whether\\ntwo or more groups of objects are significantly different based on a\\ncategorical factor. This method is memory-bound and has been recently optimized\\nfor CPU cache locality. Our tests show that GPU cores on the MI300A prefer the\\nbrute force approach instead, significantly outperforming the CPU-based\\nimplementation. The significant benefit of Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT)\\nwas also a pleasant surprise.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC,cs.PF,q-bio.QM\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T16:44:21Z\"}"}
