While the effect of phase noise\\nin the regimes of isolated qubits and few-qubit gate protocols has been studied\\nextensively, there are open questions about the effects of this noise on\\nmany-body systems. In many scenarios, the effects of noise cannot simply be\\ndescribed by an increase in the energy or temperature of the system, leading to\\nnon-trivial changes in the state and relevant correlations. In this work, we\\nuse stochastic sampling to simulate laser phase noise based on experimentally\\nrelevant spectral densities. We explore the impact of this noise on adiabatic\\nstate preparation in a one-dimensional system, discussing the interplay between\\nheating and interactions during dynamics. We find that for certain adiabatic\\nprocesses, the noise can be seen to approximately thermalize in terms of its\\neffects on relevant correlation functions.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T17:37:40Z\"}"}
