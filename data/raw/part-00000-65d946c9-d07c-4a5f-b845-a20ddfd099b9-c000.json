The ability to image the orientation of anisotropic material\\nproperties in three dimensions (3D) is fundamental for the understanding and\\nfunctionality-driven development of novel materials. With the development of X\\nray linear dichroic orientation tomography (XL DOT), it is now possible to\\nnon-destructively map three-dimensional (3D) orientation fields in\\nmicrometer-sized samples. In this work, we present the iterative,\\ngradient-based reconstruction algorithm behind XL DOT that can be used to map\\norientations based on linear dichroism in 3D. As linear dichroism can be\\nexhibited by a broad spectrum of materials, XL DOT can be used to map, for\\nexample, crystal orientations as well as ferroic alignment, such as\\nferroelectric and antiferromagnetic order. We demonstrate the robustness of\\nthis technique for orientation fields that exhibit smoothly varying and\\ngranular configurations, and subsequently identify and discuss optimal\\ngeometries for experimental data acquisition and optimal conditions for the\\nreconstruction. We anticipate that this technique will be instrumental in\\nenabling a deeper understanding of the relationship between material structures\\nand their functionality, quantifying, for example, the orientation of charge\\ndistributions and magnetic anisotropies at the nanoscale in a wide variety of\\nsystems - from functional to energy materials.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T14:31:25Z\"}"}
