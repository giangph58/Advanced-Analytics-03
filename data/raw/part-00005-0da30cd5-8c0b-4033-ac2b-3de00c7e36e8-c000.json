The proposed method integrates (i) the\\nfeedforward design and (ii) the PID gain tuning. We also establish a unified\\ntheoretical analysis for both components. For the feedforward design, we\\ndevelop an algorithm that constructs the feedforward controller directly from\\nthe input/output data, and provide a theoretical analysis on the time horizon\\nof the data. For the PID gain tuning, we formulate an optimization problem and\\nsolve it by employing a model-free policy gradient method combined with a\\nvariance reduction method. We further provide theoretical analyses on the\\nrequired time horizon and the sample complexity of the input/output data. These\\nanalyses incorporate the result of the feedforward design into that of the PID\\ngain tuning. In the numerical experiments, the proposed method successfully\\ndesigns a 2DOF PID controller in the model-free setting.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T06:02:07Z\"}"}
