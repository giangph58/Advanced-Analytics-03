These results extend those established for\\nstandard McKean-Vlasov equations in [Liu and Pag\\\\`es, Ann. App. Prob. 2023] and\\n[Liu and Pag\\\\`es, Bernoulli 2022]. Under suitable conditions, for a\\n(non-decreasing) convex functional $F$ on the path space with polynomial\\ngrowth, we show $\\\\mathbb{E}[F(X) \\\\mid B^0] \\\\leq \\\\mathbb{E}[F(Y) \\\\mid B^0]$\\nalmost surely. Moreover, for a (non-decreasing) convex functional $G$ defined\\non the product space of paths and their marginal distributions, we establish \\\\[\\n\\\\mathbb{E} \\\\Big[\\\\,G\\\\big(X, (\\\\mathcal{L}^1(X_t))_{t\\\\in[0, T]}\\\\big)\\\\,\\\\Big| \\\\,\\nB^0\\\\,\\\\Big]\\\\leq \\\\mathbb{E} \\\\Big[\\\\,G\\\\big(Y, (\\\\mathcal{L}^1(Y_t))_{t\\\\in[0,\\nT]}\\\\big)\\\\,\\\\Big| \\\\, B^0\\\\,\\\\Big] \\\\quad \\\\text{almost surely}. \\\\] Similar convex\\norder results are also established for the corresponding particle system. We\\nexplore applications of these results to stochastic control problem - deducing\\nin particular an associated comparison principle for Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman\\nequations with different coefficients - and to the interbank systemic risk\\nmodel introduced by in [Carmona, Fouque and Sun, Comm. in Math. Sci. 2015].\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:08:41Z\"}"}
