{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21526v1\", \"title\": \"Physics-Informed Priors Improve Gravitational-Wave Constraints on\\n  Neutron-Star Matter\", \"summary\": \"Gravitational-wave astronomy shows great promise in determining nuclear\\nphysics in a regime not accessible to terrestrial experiments. We introduce\\nphysics-informed priors constrained by nuclear theory and perturbative Quantum\\nChromodynamics calculations, as well as astrophysical measurements of\\nneutron-star masses and radii. When these priors are used in gravitational-wave\\nastrophysical inference, we show a significant improvement on nuclear equation\\nof state constraints. Applying these to the first observed gravitational-wave\\nbinary neutron-star merger GW170817, the constraints on the radius of a\\n$1.4\\\\,M_\\\\odot$ neutron star improve from $R_{1.4} ={12.54^{+1.05}_{-1.54}} \\\\,\\n{\\\\rm km}$ to $R_{1.4} = 12.11^{+0.91}_{-1.11} \\\\,{\\\\rm km}$ and those on the\\ntidal deformability from $\\\\tilde{\\\\Lambda}_{1.186} < 720$ to\\n$\\\\tilde{\\\\Lambda}_{1.186} = 384^{+306}_{-158}$ ($90\\\\%$ confidence intervals) at\\nthe events measured chirp mass $\\\\mathcal{M}=1.186\\\\,M_\\\\odot$. We also show these\\npriors can be used to perform model selection between binary neutron star and\\nneutron star-black hole mergers; in the case of GW190425, the results provide\\nonly marginal evidence with a Bayes factor $\\\\mathcal{BF}=1.33$ in favour of the\\nbinary neutron star merger hypothesis. Given their ability to improve the\\nastrophysical inference of binary mergers involving neutron stars, we advocate\\nfor these physics-informed priors to be used as standard in the literature and\\nprovide open-source code for reproducibility and adaptation of the method.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,gr-qc,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T11:19:52Z\"}"}
