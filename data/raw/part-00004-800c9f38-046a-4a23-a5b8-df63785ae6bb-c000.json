To specify the alternative hypothesis, we\\nneed a statistical model of dice control. Two have been suggested in the\\ngambling literature, namely the Smith-Scott model and the Wong-Shackleford\\nmodel. Both models are parameterized by $\\\\theta\\\\in[0,1]$, which measures the\\nshooter's level of control. We propose and compare four test statistics: (a)\\nthe sample proportion of 7s; (b) the sample proportion of pass-line wins; (c)\\nthe sample mean of hand-length observations; and (d) the likelihood ratio\\nstatistic for a hand-length sample. We want to test $H_0:\\\\theta = 0$ (no\\ncontrol) versus $H_1:\\\\theta > 0$ (some control). We also want to test\\n$H_0:\\\\theta\\\\le\\\\theta_0$ versus $H_1:\\\\theta>\\\\theta_0$, where $\\\\theta_0$ is the\\n\\\"break-even point.\\\" For the tests considered we estimate the power, either by\\nnormal approximation or by simulation.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:57:32Z\"}"}
