BrickSmart, a pioneering system, addresses\\nthis gap by providing spatial language guidance through a structured three-step\\nprocess: Discovery & Design, Build & Learn, and Explore & Expand. This system\\nuniquely supports parents in 1) generating personalized block-building\\ninstructions, 2) guiding parents to teach spatial language during building and\\ninteractive play, and 3) tracking children's learning progress, altogether\\nenhancing children's engagement and cognitive development. In a comparative\\nstudy involving 12 parent-child pairs children aged 6-8 years) for both\\nexperimental and control groups, BrickSmart demonstrated improvements in\\nsupportiveness, efficiency, and innovation, with a significant increase in\\nchildren's use of spatial vocabularies during block play, thereby offering an\\neffective framework for fostering spatial language skills in children.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T12:40:16Z\"}"}
