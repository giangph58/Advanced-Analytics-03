{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19536v1\", \"title\": \"TeleScope: A Longitudinal Dataset for Investigating Online Discourse and\\n  Information Interaction on Telegram\", \"summary\": \"Telegram is a globally popular instant messaging platform known for its\\nstrong emphasis on security, privacy, and unique social networking features. It\\nhas recently emerged as the host for various cross-domain analysis and research\\nworks, such as social media influence, propaganda studies, and extremism. This\\npaper introduces TeleScope, an extensive dataset suite that, to our knowledge,\\nis the largest of its kind. It comprises metadata for about 500K Telegram\\nchannels and downloaded message metadata for about 71K public channels,\\naccounting for around 120M crawled messages. We also release channel\\nconnections and user interaction data built using Telegram's message-forwarding\\nfeature to study multiple use cases, such as information spread and message\\nforwarding patterns. In addition, we provide data enrichments, such as language\\ndetection, active message posting periods for each channel, and Telegram\\nentities extracted from messages, that enable online discourse analysis beyond\\nwhat is possible with the original data alone. The dataset is designed for\\ndiverse applications, independent of specific research objectives, and\\nsufficiently versatile to facilitate the replication of social media studies\\ncomparable to those conducted on platforms like X (formerly Twitter)\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SI\", \"categories\": \"cs.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T07:37:31Z\"}"}
