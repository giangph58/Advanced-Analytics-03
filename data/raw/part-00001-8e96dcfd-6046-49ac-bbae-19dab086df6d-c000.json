{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04238v1\", \"title\": \"Exotic magnetic phase diagram and extremely robust antiferromagnetism in\\n  Ce$_2$RhIn$_8$\", \"summary\": \"The antiferromagnetic heavy-fermion compound Ce$_2$RhIn$_8$ belongs to the\\nsame family and bears similarities with the well-studied prototypical material\\nCeRhIn$_5$, which demonstrates a unique behavior under applied magnetic field.\\nHere, we report specific-heat measurements on a high-quality single crystal of\\nCe$_2$RhIn$_8$ in magnetic fields up to 35 T applied along both principal\\ncrystallographic directions. When the magnetic field is applied along the $a$\\naxis of the tetragonal crystal structure, two additional field-induced\\nantiferromagnetic phases are observed, in agreement with previous reports. One\\nof them is confined in a small area of the field-temperature phase diagram. The\\nother one, which develops above $\\\\sim$2.5 T, is very robust against the field.\\nIts transition temperature increases with field, reaches a maximum at $\\\\sim$12\\nT, and then starts to decrease. However, it tends to saturate towards the\\nhighest field of our measurements. For a field applied along the $c$ axis, the\\nN\\\\'{e}el temperature, $T_N$, initially decreases with field, as expected for a\\ntypical antiferromagnet. Surprisingly, an additional phase emerges above\\n$\\\\sim$10 T. It is most likely to be of the same origin as its counterpart\\nobserved above 2.5 T for the other field orientation. This phase is also\\nunusually robust: Its transition temperature increases all the way up to 35 T,\\nwhere it exceeds the zero field $T_N =$~2.85 K. Finally, for both field\\ndirections, the phase diagrams contain rarely observed tricritical points of\\nsecond-order phase transitions.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:41:21Z\"}"}
