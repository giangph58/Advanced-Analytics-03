When dynamics are unknown,\\ndata-driven methods can be used instead, yet obtaining a valid certificate\\nrequires rigorous uncertainty quantification. For this purpose, existing\\nmethods usually rely on full-state measurements, limiting their applicability.\\nThis paper proposes a novel approach for synthesizing barrier certificates for\\nunknown systems with latent states and polynomial dynamics. A Bayesian\\nframework is employed, where a prior in state-space representation is updated\\nusing input-output data via a targeted marginal Metropolis-Hastings sampler.\\nThe resulting samples are used to construct a candidate barrier certificate\\nthrough a sum-of-squares program. It is shown that if the candidate satisfies\\nthe required conditions on a test set of additional samples, it is also valid\\nfor the true, unknown system with high probability. The approach and its\\nprobabilistic guarantees are illustrated through a numerical simulation.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.LG,cs.SY,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:12:34Z\"}"}
