{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20684v1\", \"title\": \"Identifying Uncertainty in Self-Adaptive Robotics with Large Language\\n  Models\", \"summary\": \"Future self-adaptive robots are expected to operate in highly dynamic\\nenvironments while effectively managing uncertainties. However, identifying the\\nsources and impacts of uncertainties in such robotic systems and defining\\nappropriate mitigation strategies is challenging due to the inherent complexity\\nof self-adaptive robots and the lack of comprehensive knowledge about the\\nvarious factors influencing uncertainty. Hence, practitioners often rely on\\nintuition and past experiences from similar systems to address uncertainties.\\nIn this article, we evaluate the potential of large language models (LLMs) in\\nenabling a systematic and automated approach to identify uncertainties in\\nself-adaptive robotics throughout the software engineering lifecycle. For this\\nevaluation, we analyzed 10 advanced LLMs with varying capabilities across four\\nindustrial-sized robotics case studies, gathering the practitioners'\\nperspectives on the LLM-generated responses related to uncertainties. Results\\nshowed that practitioners agreed with 63-88% of the LLM responses and expressed\\nstrong interest in the practicality of LLMs for this purpose.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T12:07:39Z\"}"}
