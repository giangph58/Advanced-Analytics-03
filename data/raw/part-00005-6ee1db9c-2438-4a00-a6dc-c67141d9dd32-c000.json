{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12170v1\", \"title\": \"AI Behind Closed Doors: a Primer on The Governance of Internal\\n  Deployment\", \"summary\": \"The most advanced future AI systems will first be deployed inside the\\nfrontier AI companies developing them. According to these companies and\\nindependent experts, AI systems may reach or even surpass human intelligence\\nand capabilities by 2030. Internal deployment is, therefore, a key source of\\nbenefits and risks from frontier AI systems. Despite this, the governance of\\nthe internal deployment of highly advanced frontier AI systems appears absent.\\nThis report aims to address this absence by priming a conversation around the\\ngovernance of internal deployment. It presents a conceptualization of internal\\ndeployment, learnings from other sectors, reviews of existing legal frameworks\\nand their applicability, and illustrative examples of the type of scenarios we\\nare most concerned about. Specifically, it discusses the risks correlated to\\nthe loss of control via the internal application of a misaligned AI system to\\nthe AI research and development pipeline, and unconstrained and undetected\\npower concentration behind closed doors. The report culminates with a small\\nnumber of targeted recommendations that provide a first blueprint for the\\ngovernance of internal deployment.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T15:21:13Z\"}"}
