In this paper we characterize the behavior of\\nTr($\\\\Phi^3$) amplitudes under a general class of large kinematic shifts called\\n$g$-vector shifts. The objects that live in this world at infinity retain\\ncertain key amplitude-like properties, most notably factorization, and admit\\ndescriptions in terms of polytopes, but they are not generally amplitudes of\\nany cognizable theory. We identify particular $g$-vector shifts that lead at\\ninfinity to mixed amplitudes involving two pions and any number of scalars,\\nallowing us to provide polytopal descriptions of these amplitudes.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:48:15Z\"}"}
