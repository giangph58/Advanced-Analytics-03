{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16827v1\", \"title\": \"Endpoint boundedness of singular integrals: CMO space associated to\\n  Schr\\u00f6dinger operators\", \"summary\": \"Let $ \\\\mathcal{L} = -\\\\Delta + V $ be a Schr\\\\\\\"odinger operator acting on $\\nL^2(\\\\mathbb{R}^n) $, where the nonnegative potential $ V $ belongs to the\\nreverse H\\\\\\\"older class $ RH_q $ for some $ q \\\\geq n/2 $. This article is\\nprimarily concerned with the study of endpoint boundedness for classical\\nsingular integral operators in the context of the space $\\n\\\\mathrm{CMO}_{\\\\mathcal{L}}(\\\\mathbb{R}^n) $, consisting of functions of\\nvanishing mean oscillation associated with $ \\\\mathcal{L} $.\\n  We establish the following main results: (i) the standard Hardy--Littlewood\\nmaximal operator is bounded on $\\\\mathrm{CMO}_{\\\\mathcal{L}}(\\\\mathbb{R}^n) $;\\n(ii) for each $ j = 1, \\\\ldots, n$, the adjoint of the Riesz transform $\\n\\\\partial_j \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1/2} $ is bounded from $ C_0(\\\\mathbb{R}^n) $ into $\\n\\\\mathrm{CMO}_{\\\\mathcal{L}}(\\\\mathbb{R}^n) $; and (iii) the approximation to the\\nidentity generated by the Poisson and heat semigroups associated with $\\n\\\\mathcal{L} $ characterizes $ \\\\mathrm{CMO}_{\\\\mathcal{L}}(\\\\mathbb{R}^n) $\\nappropriately.\\n  These results recover the classical analogues corresponding to the Laplacian\\nas a special case. However, the presence of the potential $ V $ introduces\\nsubstantial analytical challenges, necessitating tools beyond the scope of\\nclassical Calder\\\\'on--Zygmund theory. Our approach leverages precise heat\\nkernel estimates and the structural properties of $\\n\\\\mathrm{CMO}_{\\\\mathcal{L}}(\\\\mathbb{R}^n) $ established by Song and the third\\nauthor in [J. Geom.
