{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07828v1\", \"title\": \"Dynamic disruption index across citation and cited references windows:\\n  Recommendations for thresholds in research evaluation\", \"summary\": \"The temporal dimension of citation accumulation poses fundamental challenges\\nfor quantitative research evaluations, particularly in assessing disruptive and\\nconsolidating research through the disruption index (D). While prior studies\\nemphasize minimum citation windows (mostly 3-5 years) for reliable citation\\nimpact measurements, the time-sensitive nature of D - which quantifies a paper'\\ns capacity to eclipse prior knowledge - remains underexplored. This study\\naddresses two critical gaps: (1) determining the temporal thresholds required\\nfor publications to meet citation/reference prerequisites, and (2) identifying\\n\\\"optimal\\\" citation windows that balance early predictability and longitudinal\\nvalidity. By analyzing millions of publications across four fields with varying\\ncitation dynamics, we employ some metrics to track D stabilization patterns.\\nKey findings reveal that a 10-year window achieves >80% agreement with final D\\nclassifications, while shorter windows (3 years) exhibit instability.\\nPublications with >=30 references stabilize 1-3 years faster, and extreme cases\\n(top/bottom 5% D values) become identifiable within 5 years - enabling early\\ndetection of 60-80% of highly disruptive and consolidating works. The findings\\noffer significant implications for scholarly evaluation and science policy,\\nemphasizing the need for careful consideration of citation window length in\\nresearch assessment (based on D).\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DL\", \"categories\": \"cs.DL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:05:01Z\"}"}
