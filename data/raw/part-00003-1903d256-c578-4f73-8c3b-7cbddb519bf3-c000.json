Using\\nthe one-boson-exchange potential and the complex scaling method, we investigate\\nthe $B^{(*)}\\\\bar{B}^*$ and $B^{(*)}B^*$ systems and predict several bound\\nstates and resonances. Our analysis reveals a rich spectrum, including\\n$B\\\\bar{B}^*$ ($0(1^{++})$, $0(0^{-+})$), $B^*\\\\bar{B}^*$ ($0(2^{++})$,\\n$0(0^{-+})$, $0(1^{--})$), $BB^*$ ($0(1^+)$), and $B^*B^*$ ($0(1^+)$) bound\\nstates, as well as $B\\\\bar{B}^*$ ($0(1^{--})$, $0(2^{--})$), $B^*\\\\bar{B}^*$\\n($0(3^{--})$), $BB^*$ ($0(0^-)$), and $B^*B^*$ ($0(1^-)$, $0(2^-)$) resonances.\\nOur results provide theoretical support for the existence of double-bottom\\ntetraquarks and deliver key benchmarks for future searches at LHCb, Belle II,\\nand other experiments.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:54:29Z\"}"}
