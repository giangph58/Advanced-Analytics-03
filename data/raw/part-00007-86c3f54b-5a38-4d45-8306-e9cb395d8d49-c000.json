{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07678v1\", \"title\": \"Exploiting Beamforming for Enforcing Semantic Secrecy in 5G NR mmWave\\n  Communications\", \"summary\": \"We experimentally investigate the performance of semantically-secure physical\\nlayer security (PLS) in 5G new radio (NR) mmWave communications during the\\ninitial cell search procedure in the NR band n257 at 27 GHz. A gNB transmits\\nPLS-encoded messages in the presence of an eavesdropper, who intercepts the\\ncommunication by non-intrusively collecting channel readings in the form of IQ\\nsamples. For the message transmission, we use the physical broadcast channel\\n(PBCH) within the synchronization signal block. We analyze different\\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions by progressively reducing the transmit\\npower of the subcarriers carrying the PBCH channel, while ensuring optimal\\nconditions for over-the-air frequency and timing synchronization. We measure\\nthe secrecy performance of the communication in terms of upper and lower bounds\\nfor the distinguishing error rate (DER) metric for different SNR levels and\\nbeam angles when performing beamsteering in indoor scenarios, such as office\\nenvironments and laboratory settings.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T12:07:32Z\"}"}
