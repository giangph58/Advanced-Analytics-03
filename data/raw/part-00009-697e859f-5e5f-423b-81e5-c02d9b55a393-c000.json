For the lossy source coding with side-information, also known as\\nthe Wyner-Ziv (WZ) problem, a lower bound on the strong converse exponent was\\nderived by Oohama. In this paper, we derive the tight strong converse exponent\\nfor the WZ problem; as a special case, we also derive the tight strong converse\\nexponent for the distributed function computation problem. For the converse\\npart, we use the change-of-measure argument developed in the literature and the\\nsoft Markov constraint introduced by Oohama; the matching achievability is\\nproved via the Poisson matching approach recently introduced by Li and\\nAnantharam. Our result is build upon the recently derived tight strong converse\\nexponent for the Wyner-Ahlswede-Korner (WAK) problem; however, compared to the\\nWAK problem, more sophisticated argument is needed. As an illustration of the\\nnecessity of the soft Markov constraint, we present an example such that the\\nsoft Markov constraint is strictly positive.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T03:00:44Z\"}"}
