However, it is still a challenge for existing models\\nto achieve text-image alignment when confronted with complex text prompts. In\\nthis work, we highlight two factors that affect this alignment: the quality of\\nthe randomly initialized noise and the reliability of the generated controlling\\nmask. We then propose PiCo (Pick-and-Control), a novel training-free approach\\nwith two key components to tackle these two factors. First, we develop a noise\\nselection module to assess the quality of the random noise and determine\\nwhether the noise is suitable for the target text. A fast sampling strategy is\\nutilized to ensure efficiency in the noise selection stage. Second, we\\nintroduce a referring mask module to generate pixel-level masks and to\\nprecisely modulate the cross-attention maps. The referring mask is applied to\\nthe standard diffusion process to guide the reasonable interaction between text\\nand image features. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the\\neffectiveness of PiCo in liberating users from the tedious process of random\\ngeneration and in enhancing the text-image alignment for diverse text\\ndescriptions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T05:38:13Z\"}"}
