{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20433v1\", \"title\": \"Fiber to the Room: Key Technologies, Challenges, and Prospects\", \"summary\": \"Fiber to the Room (FTTR) is a next-generation access network designed to\\ndeliver high bandwidth, low latency, and room-level optical coverage. This\\npaper presents a comprehensive analysis of the FTTR system architecture and\\nprotocol stack, focusing on three key technical aspects: centralized scheduling\\nand control, integrated management and maintenance, and green energy-saving\\nmechanisms. A simplified FTTR architecture based on the convergence of the\\nmedium access control (MAC) and physical (PHY) layers is introduced to enhance\\ncoordination and scheduling efficiency. An extended remote management scheme,\\nbased on the optical network unit management and control interface (OMCI), is\\ndescribed to enable unified control across main fiber units (MFUs) and\\nsub-fiber units (SFUs). Furthermore, a service-aware energy-saving framework is\\ndiscussed for dynamic power optimization. The paper also explores the\\nintegration of artificial intelligence (AI) and passive sensing into FTTR\\nsystems to support intelligent scheduling, energy management, and\\nenvironment-aware optimization. These insights provide technical guidance for\\nthe scalable deployment and future evolution of FTTR networks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T05:12:53Z\"}"}
