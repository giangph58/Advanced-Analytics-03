Here, we demonstrate how the SCE can spoil the\\naccuracy of MLIPs trained on these data, taking high-pressure hydrogen as test\\ncase. We then apply a recently introduced SCE correction [ Phys. Rev. B 109,\\n205151 (2024)] to generate unbiased VMC training sets based on a\\nJastrow-correlated single determinant WF with frozen Kohn-Sham orbitals. The\\nMLIPs generated within this framework are significantly improved and can\\napproach in quality those trained on datasets built with fully optimized WFs.\\nOur conclusions are further supported by MD simulations, which show how MLIPs\\ntrained on SCE-corrected datasets systematically yield more reliable physical\\nobservables. Our framework opens the possibility of constructing extended\\nhigh-quality training sets with VMC.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.dis-nn,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T07:22:31Z\"}"}
