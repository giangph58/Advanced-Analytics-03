In this\\npaper, we propose a novel Multi-Omics Factor-Adjusted Cox (MOFA-Cox) model to\\nhandle multi-omics survival data, addressing the intricate correlation\\nstructures across different omics layers. Building upon this model, we\\nintroduce a decorrelated score test for the Cox model in high-dimensional\\nsurvival analysis. We establish the theoretical properties of our test\\nstatistic, which show that it admits a closed-form asymptotic distribution,\\neliminating the need for resampling. We further analyze its local power under\\nlocal alternatives. Importantly, our test statistic does not require a sparsity\\nassumption on the covariates of interest, broadening its applicability.\\nNumerical studies and an applaication to the TCGA breast cancer dataset\\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T05:20:36Z\"}"}
