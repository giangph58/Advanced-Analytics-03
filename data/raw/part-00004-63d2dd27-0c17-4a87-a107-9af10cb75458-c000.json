{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09941v1\", \"title\": \"FedRecon: Missing Modality Reconstruction in Distributed Heterogeneous\\n  Environments\", \"summary\": \"Multimodal data are often incomplete and exhibit Non-Independent and\\nIdentically Distributed (Non-IID) characteristics in real-world scenarios.\\nThese inherent limitations lead to both modality heterogeneity through partial\\nmodality absence and data heterogeneity from distribution divergence, creating\\nfundamental challenges for effective federated learning (FL). To address these\\ncoupled challenges, we propose FedRecon, the first method targeting\\nsimultaneous missing modality reconstruction and Non-IID adaptation in\\nmultimodal FL. Our approach first employs a lightweight Multimodal Variational\\nAutoencoder (MVAE) to reconstruct missing modalities while preserving\\ncross-modal consistency. Distinct from conventional imputation methods, we\\nachieve sample-level alignment through a novel distribution mapping mechanism\\nthat guarantees both data consistency and completeness. Additionally, we\\nintroduce a strategy employing global generator freezing to prevent\\ncatastrophic forgetting, which in turn mitigates Non-IID fluctuations.\\nExtensive evaluations on multimodal datasets demonstrate FedRecon's superior\\nperformance in modality reconstruction under Non-IID conditions, surpassing\\nstate-of-the-art methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T07:04:10Z\"}"}
