Most databases thus constructed rely on the generalized\\ngradient approximation (GGA) for electron exchange and correlation. This limits\\nthe reliability of these databases, as well as the artificial intelligence (AI)\\nmodels trained on them, for certain classes of materials and properties which\\nare not well described by GGA. In this paper, we describe a database of 7,024\\ninorganic materials presenting diverse structures and compositions generated\\nusing hybrid functional calculations enabled by their efficient implementation\\nin the all-electron code FHI-aims. The database is used to evaluate the\\nthermodynamic and electrochemical stability of oxides relevant to catalysis and\\nenergy related applications. We illustrate how the database can be used to\\ntrain AI models for material properties using the sure-independence screening\\nand sparsifying operator (SISSO) approach.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:24:27Z\"}"}
