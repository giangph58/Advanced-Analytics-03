To this\\nend, we propose a fast sign retrieval method on the basis of binary\\nclassification machine learning. We first introduce 3D representations of the\\namplitudes and signs, where we pack amplitudes/signs belonging to the same\\nfrequency band into a 2D slice, referred to as the sub-band block. We then\\nretrieve the signs from the 3D amplitudes via binary classification, where each\\nsign is regarded as a binary label. We implement a binary classification\\nalgorithm using convolutional neural networks, which are advantageous for\\nefficiently extracting features in the 3D amplitudes. Experimental results\\ndemonstrate that our method achieves accurate sign retrieval with an\\noverwhelmingly low computation cost.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,eess.IV,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T13:34:06Z\"}"}
