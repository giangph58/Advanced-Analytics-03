This might be of interest for the general theory of post-Hopf\\nalgebras. Using a magmatic approach, we explore post-Lie algebras connected to\\nmultiple zeta values and their $q$-analogues. For multiple zeta values, this\\nframework yields an algebraic interpretation of the Goncharov coproduct.\\nAssuming that the Bernoulli numbers satisfy the so called threshold shuffle\\nidentities, we present a post-Lie structure, whose induced Lie bracket we\\nexpect to restrict to the dual of indecomposables of multiple $q$-zeta values.\\nOur post-Lie algebras align with Ecalle's theory of bimoulds: we explicitly\\nidentify the ari bracket with a post-Lie structure on a free Lie algebra, and\\nconjecture a correspondence for the uri bracket.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT,math-ph,math.CO,math.MP,math.RA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T10:21:07Z\"}"}
