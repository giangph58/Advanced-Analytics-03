{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19994v1\", \"title\": \"Semi-parametric bulk and tail regression using spline-based neural\\n  networks\", \"summary\": \"Semi-parametric quantile regression (SPQR) is a flexible approach to density\\nregression that learns a spline-based representation of conditional density\\nfunctions using neural networks. As it makes no parametric assumptions about\\nthe underlying density, SPQR performs well for in-sample testing and\\ninterpolation. However, it can perform poorly when modelling heavy-tailed data\\nor when asked to extrapolate beyond the range of observations, as it fails to\\nsatisfy any of the asymptotic guarantees provided by extreme value theory\\n(EVT). To build semi-parametric density regression models that can be used for\\nreliable tail extrapolation, we create the blended generalised Pareto (GP)\\ndistribution, which i) provides a model for the entire range of data and, via a\\nsmooth and continuous transition, ii) benefits from exact GP upper-tails\\nwithout the need for intermediate threshold selection. We combine SPQR with our\\nblended GP to create extremal semi-parametric quantile regression (xSPQR),\\nwhich provides a flexible semi-parametric approach to density regression that\\nis compliant with traditional EVT. We handle interpretability of xSPQR through\\nthe use of model-agnostic variable importance scores, which provide the\\nrelative importance of a covariate for separately determining the bulk and tail\\nof the conditional density. The efficacy of xSPQR is illustrated on simulated\\ndata, and an application to U.S. wildfire burnt areas.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:15:03Z\"}"}
