Dielectrons are emitted during the entire evolution of the medium\\ncreated in such collisions, allowing the extraction of the real direct photon\\nfraction at vanishing mass and providing access to thermal radiation from the\\nearly hot stages of the collision. The measurement of dielectron and\\ndirect-photon production in minimum-bias pp collisions serves as a crucial\\nbaseline for the studies in heavy-ion collisions, whereas pp collisions with\\nhigh charged-particle multiplicities allow the search for the possible presence\\nof QGP in small systems. An overview of the final results of dielectron\\nproduction in pp at $\\\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV and in central \\\\PbPb collisions at\\n\\\\fivenn measured by ALICE is presented, together with their implications for\\nthe production of thermal radiation. Finally, an outlook on future measurements\\nis given with the first performance studies from Run 3.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-ex\", \"categories\": \"nucl-ex,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T16:09:58Z\"}"}
