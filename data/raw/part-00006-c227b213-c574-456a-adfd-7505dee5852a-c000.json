Inspired by previous studies, we\\npropose a method to efficiently screen these models using likelihood\\nreweighting based on the fiducial model. In order to alleviate the well-known\\nunstable weight estimates in vanilla importance sampling, we implement\\nreweighting for the second time making use of the kernel density estimation of\\nthe previously reweighted samples. We tested this method by analyzing three\\nsimulated datasets with an injected sinusoid signal applied to all pulsars. It\\nis found that likelihood reweighting not only gives results compatible with\\nthose from full Bayesian analyses when the signal is subdominant, but is also\\nable to recover the signal posterior to a reasonable accuracy in the presence\\nof a rather strong signal. Given samples from the fiducial model, this method\\ncould bring an at least $\\\\mathcal{O}(10)$-time speedup in analyzing new models.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T02:50:28Z\"}"}
