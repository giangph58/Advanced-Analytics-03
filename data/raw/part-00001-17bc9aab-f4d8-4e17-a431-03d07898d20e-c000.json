{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17765v1\", \"title\": \"Extended Scalar Particle Solutions in Black String Spacetimes with\\n  Anisotropic Quintessence\", \"summary\": \"We present new solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation for a scalar particle\\nin a black string spacetime immersed in an anisotropic quintessence fluid\\nsurrounded by a cloud of strings, extending the analysis presented in our\\nprevious work. These novel solutions are dependent on the quintessence state\\nparameter, $\\\\alpha_{Q}$, and are now valid for a much larger domain of the\\nradial coordinate. We investigate the cases when $\\\\alpha_{Q} = 0,\\\\,1/2,\\\\,1$,\\nencompassing both black hole and horizonless scenarios. We express the\\nresulting radial wave functions using the confluent and biconfluent Heun\\nfunctions, with special cases represented by Bessel functions. We derive\\nrestrictions on the allowed quantum energy levels by imposing constraints on\\nthe Heun parameters to ensure polynomial solutions. Furthermore, we investigate\\nthe emergence of \\\"dark phases\\\" associated with the radial wave function,\\nfocusing on the interesting case of $\\\\alpha_{Q} = 1$. Our findings provide\\ninsights into the dynamics of scalar particles in this complex spacetime and\\nthe potential impact of dark energy on quantum systems.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T17:34:07Z\"}"}
