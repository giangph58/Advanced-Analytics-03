It estimates the a posteriori reliability\\nbased on the space explored by a list decoder, i.e., the set of vectors for\\nwhich the list decoder knows whether they are codewords. This approach enables\\na more accurate calculation of the a posteriori reliability and results in\\ngains of up to 0.25$\\\\,$dB for turbo product decoding with SOCS decoding\\ncompared to Chase-Pyndiah decoding.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T16:20:13Z\"}"}
