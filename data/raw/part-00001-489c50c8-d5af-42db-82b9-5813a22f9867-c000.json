{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23717v1\", \"title\": \"Effective Cloud Removal for Remote Sensing Images by an Improved\\n  Mean-Reverting Denoising Model with Elucidated Design Space\", \"summary\": \"Cloud removal (CR) remains a challenging task in remote sensing image\\nprocessing. Although diffusion models (DM) exhibit strong generative\\ncapabilities, their direct applications to CR are suboptimal, as they generate\\ncloudless images from random noise, ignoring inherent information in cloudy\\ninputs. To overcome this drawback, we develop a new CR model EMRDM based on\\nmean-reverting diffusion models (MRDMs) to establish a direct diffusion process\\nbetween cloudy and cloudless images. Compared to current MRDMs, EMRDM offers a\\nmodular framework with updatable modules and an elucidated design space, based\\non a reformulated forward process and a new ordinary differential equation\\n(ODE)-based backward process. Leveraging our framework, we redesign key MRDM\\nmodules to boost CR performance, including restructuring the denoiser via a\\npreconditioning technique, reorganizing the training process, and improving the\\nsampling process by introducing deterministic and stochastic samplers. To\\nachieve multi-temporal CR, we further develop a denoising network for\\nsimultaneously denoising sequential images. Experiments on mono-temporal and\\nmulti-temporal datasets demonstrate the superior performance of EMRDM.
