Our approach unifies decision-making and rhythmic\\npattern generation within a simple yet powerful network architecture that\\nemploys all-to-all inhibitory connections enhanced by designable excitatory\\ninteractions. This design offers significant advantages regarding ease of\\nimplementation, adaptability, and robustness. We demonstrate its efficacy\\nthrough a ring oscillator model, which exhibits adaptive phase and frequency\\nmodulation, making the framework particularly promising for applications in\\nneuromorphic systems and robotics.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.AI,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:40:37Z\"}"}
