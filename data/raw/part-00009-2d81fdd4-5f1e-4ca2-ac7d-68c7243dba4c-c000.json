{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19948v1\", \"title\": \"Tendon-Actuated Concentric Tube Endonasal Robot (TACTER)\", \"summary\": \"Endoscopic endonasal approaches (EEA) have become more prevalent for\\nminimally invasive skull base and sinus surgeries. However, rigid scopes and\\ntools significantly decrease the surgeon's ability to operate in tight\\nanatomical spaces and avoid critical structures such as the internal carotid\\nartery and cranial nerves. This paper proposes a novel tendon-actuated\\nconcentric tube endonasal robot (TACTER) design in which two tendon-actuated\\nrobots are concentric to each other, resulting in an outer and inner robot that\\ncan bend independently. The outer robot is a unidirectionally asymmetric notch\\n(UAN) nickel-titanium robot, and the inner robot is a 3D-printed bidirectional\\nrobot, with a nickel-titanium bending member. In addition, the inner robot can\\ntranslate axially within the outer robot, allowing the tool to traverse through\\nstructures while bending, thereby executing follow-the-leader motion. A\\nCosserat-rod based mechanical model is proposed that uses tendon tension of\\nboth tendon-actuated robots and the relative translation between the robots as\\ninputs and predicts the TACTER tip position for varying input parameters. The\\nmodel is validated with experiments, and a human cadaver experiment is\\npresented to demonstrate maneuverability from the nostril to the sphenoid\\nsinus. This work presents the first tendon-actuated concentric tube (TACT)\\ndexterous robotic tool capable of performing follow-the-leader motion within\\nnatural nasal orifices to cover workspaces typically required for a successful\\nEEA.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:19:50Z\"}"}
