An explicit formula is derived for the rate of\\nbaryogenesis in these spacetimes, which depends on the mass $m$ of the\\nparticles, the conformal factor $\\\\Omega$ and a future directed timelike vector\\nfield $u$ (dubbed the regularizing vector field). Our analysis covers\\nFriedmann-Lema{\\\\^i}tre-Robertson-Walker, Milne and Milne-like spacetimes. It\\nsets the ground for concrete, quantitative predictions for specific\\ncosmological spacetimes.\", \"main_category\": \"math-ph\", \"categories\": \"math-ph,gr-qc,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T10:53:31Z\"}"}
