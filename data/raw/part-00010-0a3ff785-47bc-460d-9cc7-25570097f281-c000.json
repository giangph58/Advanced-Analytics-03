First, using the new values of reddening $E(B-V)$\\nand distance modulus $(m-M)_V$, and bolometric corrections from Kurucz model\\natmospheres, we determine the effective temperatures and luminosities of all SX\\nPhe variables in $\\\\omega$ Cen with available $(B-V)$ colours. Next, we\\ncarefully select SX Phe stars that have a frequency ratio strongly suggesting\\nexcitation of two radial modes, and, in addition, their preliminary pulsational\\nmodels have the values of $(T_{\\\\rm eff},~ L)$ consistent with observational\\ndeterminations. For five double-mode radial pulsators, we perform an extensive\\nseismic modeling using the Bayesian analysis based on Monte Carlo simulations.\\nWe study the effect of opacity tables and helium abundance. With the OPAL data\\nand $Y=0.30$, we obtained masses in the range (1.0,~1.2) M$_{\\\\odot}$,\\nmetallicity $Z\\\\in(0.0007,~0.0029)$ and the age of about (1.9,~3.8) Gyr. The OP\\nand OPLIB seismic models have always higher metallicites, sometimes outside the\\nallowed range for $\\\\omega$ Cen. In the case of three stars, we find seismic\\nmodels within the observed range of $(T_{\\\\rm eff},~L)$ with all three opacity\\ntables. In the case of two stars, with the highest metallicity, seismic models\\ncomputed with the OP and OPLIB tables are located far outside the observed\\nerror box. The OPAL seismic models follow the age$-$metallicity relation known\\nfor $\\\\omega$ Cen from the literature.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T16:50:15Z\"}"}
