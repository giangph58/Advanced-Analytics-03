Despite growing global interest,\\nlittle is known about the factors influencing travel mode choice of children\\nfor school journeys in Switzerland. This study addresses this gap by applying a\\nrandom forest classifier - a machine learning algorithm - to data from the\\nSwiss Mobility and Transport Microcensus, in order to identify key predictors\\nof children's travel mode choice for school journeys. Distance consistently\\nemerges as the most important predictor across all models, for instance when\\ndistinguishing between active vs. non-active travel or car vs. non-car usage.\\nThe models show relatively high performance, with overall classification\\naccuracy of 87.27% (active vs. non-active) and 78.97% (car vs. non-car),\\nrespectively. The study offers empirically grounded insights that can support\\nschool mobility policies and demonstrates the potential of machine learning in\\nuncovering behavioral patterns in complex transport datasets.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T07:18:23Z\"}"}
