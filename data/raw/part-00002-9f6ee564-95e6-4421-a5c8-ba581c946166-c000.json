{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16523v1\", \"title\": \"Alternately-optimized SNN method for acoustic scattering problem in\\n  unbounded domain\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning-based method to solve the\\nacoustic scattering problem in unbounded domain. We first employ the\\nDirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operator to truncate the physically unbounded domain\\ninto a computable bounded domain. This transformation reduces the original\\nscattering problem in the unbounded domain to a boundary value problem within\\nthe bounded domain. To solve this boundary value problem, we design a neural\\nnetwork with a subspace layer, where each neuron in this layer represents a\\nbasis function. Consequently, the approximate solution can be expressed by a\\nlinear combination of these basis functions. Furthermore, we introduce an\\ninnovative alternating optimization technique which alternately updates the\\nbasis functions and their linear combination coefficients respectively by\\ntraining and least squares methods. In our method, we set the coefficients of\\nbasis functions to 1 and use a new loss function each time train the subspace.\\nThese innovations ensure that the subspace formed by these basis functions is\\ntruly optimized. We refer to this method as the alternately-optimized subspace\\nmethod based on neural networks (AO-SNN). Extensive numerical experiments\\ndemonstrate that our new method can significantly reduce the relative $l^2$\\nerror to $10^{-7}$ or lower, outperforming existing machine learning-based\\nmethods to the best of our knowledge.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T08:46:22Z\"}"}
