In this work, we\\npresent possible evidence for the first detection of the $^7$Be line at 478\\nkeV, observed with the INTEGRAL satellite. The emission is temporally and\\nspatially coincident with the outburst of the bright nova V1369 Cen, and line\\nsignificance ranges from 2.5$\\\\sigma$ to $\\\\sim$1.9$\\\\sigma$, depending on the\\ndetection methodology. A bootstrap analysis, assuming a fixed FWHM of 8 keV,\\nprovides a flux of $(4.9 \\\\pm 2.0) \\\\times 10^{-4}$ ph/cm$^2$/s centered at 479.0\\n$\\\\pm$ 2.5 keV, with a 2.5$\\\\sigma$ significant excess. This flux implies a total\\n$^7$Be mass of $M_{^7Be} = (1.2^{+2.0}_{-0.6})$ $\\\\times 10^{-8}$ M$_{\\\\odot}$ at\\nthe distance determined using several indicators including the {\\\\em Gaia}\\nsatellite. For a nova ejected mass estimated from radio observations, this\\nresult implies a $^7$Be=Li yield corresponding to $A(Li) = 7.1^{+0.7}_{-0.3}$.\\nThis value is comparable to those measured in a dozen novae through optical\\nobservations. Crucially, we confirm optically derived $^7$Li yields and\\ndemonstrate the groundbreaking potential of using gamma-ray data to measure Li\\nabundances.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T15:42:02Z\"}"}
