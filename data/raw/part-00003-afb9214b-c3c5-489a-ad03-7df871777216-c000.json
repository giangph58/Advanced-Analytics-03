{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05350v1\", \"title\": \"Magnetic ground states of highly doped two-leg Hubbard ladders with a\\n  particle bath\", \"summary\": \"We investigate the ground-state magnetism of a Hubbard model in a system\\nconsisting of a main frame (subsystem) and a particle bath (center sites). The\\nhole doping in the main frame is controlled by adjusting the chemical potential\\nof the particle bath. In the weakly doped region, the saturated ferromagnetic\\nstate emerges due to the Nagaoka mechanism [Phys. Rev. B 90, 224426 (2014)].\\nHowever, in the highly doped region, a variety of intriguing magnetic states\\nare observed, including partially polarized states and nonmagnetic states. To\\nunderstand these states, we analyze the state of the subsystem by comparing its\\nproperties with those of a two-leg ladder system, which corresponds to the\\nsubsystem with the center sites removed. Furthermore, to gain insight into the\\nmicroscopic origin of the magnetic phase diagram, we study the ground state of\\nthe corresponding effective t-J model, derived from the Hubbard model by\\nconsidering the second-order processes of the electron hopping. The phase\\ndiagram is well reproduced by the effective t-J model, which includes the\\nthree-site pair-hopping term. To elucidate the competition among different\\nenergy contributions, such as potential, kinetic, and magnetic energies, we\\nclassify the energies within the effective t-J model.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:40:23Z\"}"}
