{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00311v1\", \"title\": \"PDCS: A Primal-Dual Large-Scale Conic Programming Solver with GPU\\n  Enhancements\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we introduce the \\\"Primal-Dual Conic Programming Solver\\\"\\n(PDCS), a large-scale conic programming solver with GPU enhancements. Problems\\nthat PDCS currently supports include linear programs, second-order cone\\nprograms, convex quadratic programs, and exponential cone programs. PDCS\\nachieves scalability to large-scale problems by leveraging sparse matrix-vector\\nmultiplication as its core computational operation, which is both\\nmemory-efficient and well-suited for GPU acceleration. The solver is based on\\nthe restarted primal-dual hybrid gradient method but further incorporates\\nseveral enhancements, including adaptive reflected Halpern restarts, adaptive\\nstep-size selection, adaptive weight adjustment, and diagonal rescaling.\\nAdditionally, PDCS employs a bijection-based method to compute projections onto\\nrescaled cones. Furthermore, cuPDCS is a GPU implementation of PDCS and it\\nimplements customized computational schemes that utilize different levels of\\nGPU architecture to handle cones of different types and sizes. Numerical\\nexperiments demonstrate that cuPDCS is generally more efficient than\\nstate-of-the-art commercial solvers and other first-order methods on\\nlarge-scale conic program applications, including Fisher market equilibrium\\nproblems, Lasso regression, and multi-period portfolio optimization.\\nFurthermore, cuPDCS also exhibits better scalability, efficiency, and\\nrobustness compared to other first-order methods on the conic program benchmark\\ndataset CBLIB. These advantages are more pronounced in large-scale,\\nlower-accuracy settings.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.MS\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T05:13:48Z\"}"}
