Using Atacama Large\\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 7 observations in spectral scanning\\nmode, we carried out a deep search for COMs within the disk of V883 Ori,\\ncovering frequency ranges of $\\\\sim$ 348 - 366 GHz. V883 Ori is an FUor object\\ncurrently undergoing an accretion burst, which increases its luminosity and\\nconsequently increases the temperature of the surrounding protoplanetary disk,\\nfacilitating the detection of COMs in the gas phase. We identified 26\\nmolecules, including 14 COMs and 12 other molecules, with first detection in\\nthis source of the molecules: CH3OD, H2C17O, and H213CO. We searched for\\nmultiple nitrogen-bearing COMs, as CH3CN had been the only nitrogen-bearing COM\\nthat has been identified so far in this source. We also detected CH3CN, and\\ntentatively detect CH3CH2CN, CH2CHCN, CH3OCN, CH3NCO, and NH2CHO. We compared\\nthe abundances relative to CH3OH with those in the handful of objects with\\nprevious detections of these species: the Class 0 protostars IRAS 16293-2422 A,\\nIRAS 16293-2422 B and B1-c, the high-mass star-forming region Sagittarius B2\\n(North), the Solar System comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and the\\nprotoplanetary disk of Oph-IRS 48. We report $\\\\sim$ 1 to 3 orders of magnitude\\nhigher abundances compared to Class 0 protostars and $\\\\sim$ 1 to 3 orders of\\nmagnitude lower abundances compared to the protoplanetary disk, Sagittarius B2\\n(North), and 67P/C-G. These results indicate that the protoplanetary disk phase\\ncould contribute to build up of COMs.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:15:46Z\"}"}
