{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10233v1\", \"title\": \"Bingo: Radix-based Bias Factorization for Random Walk on Dynamic Graphs\", \"summary\": \"Random walks are a primary means for extracting information from large-scale\\ngraphs. While most real-world graphs are inherently dynamic, state-of-the-art\\nrandom walk engines failed to efficiently support such a critical use case.\\nThis paper takes the initiative to build a general random walk engine for\\ndynamically changing graphs with two key principles: (i) This system should\\nsupport both low-latency streaming updates and high-throughput batched updates.\\n(ii) This system should achieve fast sampling speed while maintaining\\nacceptable space consumption to support dynamic graph updates. Upholding both\\nstandards, we introduce Bingo, a GPU-based random walk engine for dynamically\\nchanging graphs. First, we propose a novel radix-based bias factorization\\nalgorithm to support constant time sampling complexity while supporting fast\\nstreaming updates. Second, we present a group-adaption design to reduce space\\nconsumption dramatically. Third, we incorporate GPU-aware designs to support\\nhigh-throughput batched graph updates on massively parallel platforms.\\nTogether, Bingo outperforms existing efforts across various applications,\\nsettings, and datasets, achieving up to a 271.11x speedup compared to the\\nstate-of-the-art efforts.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T13:53:58Z\"}"}
