{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13105v1\", \"title\": \"A Bad Example for Jain's Iterative Rounding Theorem for the Cover Small\\n  Cuts Problem\", \"summary\": \"Jain's iterative rounding theorem is a well-known result in the area of\\napproximation algorithms and, more broadly, in combinatorial optimization. The\\ntheorem asserts that LP relaxations of several problems in network design and\\ncombinatorial optimization have the following key property: for every basic\\nsolution $x$ there exists a variable $x_e$ that has value at least a constant\\n(e.g., $x_e\\\\geq\\\\frac12$).\\n  We construct an example showing that this property fails to hold for the\\nCover Small Cuts problem. In this problem, we are given an undirected,\\ncapacitated graph $G=(V,E),u$ and a threshold value $\\\\lambda$, as well as a set\\nof links $L$ with end-nodes in $V$ and a non-negative cost for each link\\n$\\\\ell\\\\in L$; the goal is to find a minimum-cost set of links such that each\\nnon-trivial cut of capacity less than $\\\\lambda$ is covered by a link.\\n  This indicates that the polyhedron of feasible solutions to the LP relaxation\\n(of Cover Small Cuts) differs in an essential way from the polyhedrons\\nassociated with several problems in combinatorial optimization. Moreover, our\\nexample shows that a direct application of Jain's iterative rounding algorithm\\ndoes not give an $O(1)$ approximation algorithm for Cover Small Cuts. We\\nmention that Bansal et al. (Algorithmica 2024) present an $O(1)$ approximation\\nalgorithm for Cover Small Cuts based on the primal-dual method of Williamson et\\nal. (Combinatorica 1995).\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:19:02Z\"}"}
