This\\npaper presents StayLTC, a multimodal deep learning framework developed to\\nforecast real-time hospital LOS using Liquid Time-Constant Networks (LTCs).\\nLTCs, with their continuous-time recurrent dynamics, are evaluated against\\ntraditional models using structured data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs)\\nand clinical notes. Our evaluation, conducted on the MIMIC-III dataset,\\ndemonstrated that LTCs significantly outperform most of the other time series\\nmodels, offering enhanced accuracy, robustness, and efficiency in resource\\nutilization. Additionally, LTCs demonstrate a comparable performance in LOS\\nprediction compared to time series large language models, while requiring\\nsignificantly less computational power and memory, underscoring their potential\\nto advance Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks in healthcare.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T05:27:53Z\"}"}
