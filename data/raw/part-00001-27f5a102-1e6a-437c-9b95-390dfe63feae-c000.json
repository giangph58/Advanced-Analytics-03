In FL, cross-silo data providers often hesitate to share their\\nhigh-quality dataset unless their data value can be fairly assessed. Shapley\\nvalue (SV) has been advocated as the standard metric for data valuation in FL\\ndue to its desirable properties. However, the computational overhead of SV is\\nprohibitive in practice, as it inherently requires training and evaluating an\\nFL model across an exponential number of dataset combinations. Furthermore,\\nexisting solutions fail to achieve high accuracy and efficiency, making\\npractical use of SV still out of reach, because they ignore choosing suitable\\ncomputation scheme for approximation framework and overlook the property of\\nutility function in FL. We first propose a unified stratified-sampling\\nframework for two widely-used schemes. Then, we analyze and choose the more\\npromising scheme under the FL linear regression assumption. After that, we\\nidentify a phenomenon termed key combinations, where only limited dataset\\ncombinations have a high-impact on final data value. Building on these\\ninsights, we propose a practical approximation algorithm, IPSS, which\\nstrategically selects high-impact dataset combinations rather than evaluating\\nall possible combinations, thus substantially reducing time cost with minor\\napproximation error. Furthermore, we conduct extensive evaluations on the FL\\nbenchmark datasets to demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms a\\nseries of representative baselines in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.DB\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T12:36:20Z\"}"}
