{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05110v1\", \"title\": \"p-complete square-free Word-representation of Word-representable Graphs\", \"summary\": \"A graph $G = (V,E)$ is word-representable, if there exists a word $w$ over\\nthe alphabet $V$ such that for letters ${x,y} \\\\in V$ , $x$ and $y$ alternate in\\n$w$ if and only if $xy$ is an edge in the graph $G$. In this paper, we\\nintroduce the concept of $p$-complete square-free word-representable graph\\n$G(V,E)$. A word $w$ defined over alphabet $V$ is called $p$-complete\\nsquare-free word if there does not exist any subset $S\\\\subseteq \\\\Sigma$ such\\nthat the word $w_{S}$ contains a square $XX$ where $|X| \\\\ge p$ and $1\\\\le p \\\\le\\n|w|/2$. A word-representable graph is considered $p$-complete square-free\\nword-representable if there exists a $p$-complete square-free word-representant\\nof that graph. This pattern is significant as it proves the existence of\\npatterns that do not depend on graph labelling and cannot be avoided by certain\\nclasses of word-representable graphs. The class of word-representable graphs\\nincludes both $p$-complete square-free word-representable graphs and\\nnon-$p$-complete square-free word-representable graphs. Additionally, this\\nconcept generalises the square pattern found in the words. A word-representable\\ngraph is $p$-complete square-free uniform word-representable if its\\n$p$-complete square-free word-representant is a uniform word. We analyse the\\nproperties of $p$-complete square-free uniform words and find that the graphs\\nrepresented by these words avoid having $K_p$ (the complete graph on $p$\\nvertices) as an induced subgraph. We provide classifications for small values\\nof $p$: for $p=1$, only complete graphs and for $p=2$, only complete and\\nedgeless graphs satisfy the condition. We find that $K_3$-free circle graphs\\nare 3-complete square-free uniform word-representable. Furthermore, we\\nestablish that only graphs with representation number at most 3 can be\\n3-complete square-free uniform word-representable and provide a constructive\\nmethod to generate such graphs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DM\", \"categories\": \"cs.DM,math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T10:21:12Z\"}"}
