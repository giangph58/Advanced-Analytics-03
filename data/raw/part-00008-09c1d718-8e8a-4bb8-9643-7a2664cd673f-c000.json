This work presents a new\\nmethodology for approximating Bayesian inference by sums of uniform\\ndistributions on convex polytopes. The methodology presented herein is\\ndeveloped from the simplest convex polytope filter that takes advantage of\\nuniform prior and measurement uncertainty, to an operationally viable ensemble\\nfilter with Kalmanized approximations to updating convex polytopes. Numerical\\nresults on the Ikeda map show the viability of this methodology in the\\nlow-dimensional setting, and numerical results on the Lorenz '96 equations\\nsimilarly show viability in the high-dimensional setting.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,math.PR,stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T17:56:58Z\"}"}
