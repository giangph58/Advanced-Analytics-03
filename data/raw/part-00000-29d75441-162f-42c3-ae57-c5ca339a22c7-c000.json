{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16606v1\", \"title\": \"HUG: Hierarchical Urban Gaussian Splatting with Block-Based\\n  Reconstruction\", \"summary\": \"As urban 3D scenes become increasingly complex and the demand for\\nhigh-quality rendering grows, efficient scene reconstruction and rendering\\ntechniques become crucial. We present HUG, a novel approach to address\\ninefficiencies in handling large-scale urban environments and intricate details\\nbased on 3D Gaussian splatting. Our method optimizes data partitioning and the\\nreconstruction pipeline by incorporating a hierarchical neural Gaussian\\nrepresentation. We employ an enhanced block-based reconstruction pipeline\\nfocusing on improving reconstruction quality within each block and reducing the\\nneed for redundant training regions around block boundaries. By integrating\\nneural Gaussian representation with a hierarchical architecture, we achieve\\nhigh-quality scene rendering at a low computational cost. This is demonstrated\\nby our state-of-the-art results on public benchmarks, which prove the\\neffectiveness and advantages in large-scale urban scene representation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GR\", \"categories\": \"cs.GR,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T10:40:40Z\"}"}
