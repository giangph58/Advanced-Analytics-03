Main applications include: (i) a pointwise lower estimate of the\\ngraphing radius of a properly embedded hypersurface; (ii) the construction of\\nmetrics of bounded geometry on arbitrary manifolds with boundary; (iii) the\\nequivalence of the classical (topological) notion of orientation with that of\\nthe geometric notion (in the sense of metric measure spaces) on arbitrary\\nRiemannian manifolds with boundary. In addition, we prove that every manifold\\nwith boundary admits a metric with bounded geometry such that the boundary\\nbecomes convex. This result strengthens the justification of a recent notion of\\norientation on finite dimensional RCD spaces.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:27:49Z\"}"}
