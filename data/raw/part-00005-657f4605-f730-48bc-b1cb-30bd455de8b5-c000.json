It is known that the nonlinear\\nSchr{\\\\\\\"o}dinger (NLS) equation on periodic metric graphs can be reduced\\nasymptotically on long but finite time intervals to the homogeneous NLS\\nequation, which admits traveling solitary wave solutions. In order to address\\npersistence of such traveling waves beyond finite time intervals, we formulate\\nthe existence problem for traveling waves via spatial dynamics. There exist no\\nspatially decaying (solitary) waves because of an infinite-dimensional center\\nmanifold in the spatial dynamics formulation. Existence of traveling modulating\\npulse solutions which are solitary waves with small oscillatory tails at very\\nlong distances from the pulse core is proven by using a local center-saddle\\nmanifold. We show that the variational formulation fails to capture existence\\nof such modulating pulse solutions even in the singular limit of zero wave\\nspeeds where true (standing) solitary waves exist. Propagation of a traveling\\nsolitary wave and formation of a small oscillatory tail outside the pulse core\\nis shown in numerical simulations of the NLS equation on the periodic graph.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T07:59:41Z\"}"}
