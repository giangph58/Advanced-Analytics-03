It is shown that\\nevery randomized streaming algorithm for this problem needs space $\\\\Omega(\\\\log\\nn + \\\\log b - \\\\log \\\\epsilon) - \\\\mathcal{O}(1)$, where $n$ is length of the input\\nstream and $b$ is the bit length of the input numbers. This matches an upper\\nbound from Alur et al.~up to a constant multiplicative factor. Moreover, we\\nconsider the threshold problem, where it is asked whether the product of the\\ninput probabilities is below a given threshold. It is shown that every\\nrandomized streaming algorithm for this problem needs space $\\\\Omega(n \\\\cdot\\nb)$.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T08:34:04Z\"}"}
