{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12249v1\", \"title\": \"Comparative Evaluation of Radiomics and Deep Learning Models for Disease\\n  Detection in Chest Radiography\", \"summary\": \"The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging has\\nrevolutionized diagnostic practices, enabling advanced analysis and\\ninterpretation of radiological data. This study presents a comprehensive\\nevaluation of radiomics-based and deep learning-based approaches for disease\\ndetection in chest radiography, focusing on COVID-19, lung opacity, and viral\\npneumonia. While deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural\\nnetworks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), learn directly from image data,\\nradiomics-based models extract and analyze quantitative features, potentially\\nproviding advantages in data-limited scenarios. This study systematically\\ncompares the diagnostic accuracy and robustness of various AI models, including\\nDecision Trees, Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines\\n(SVM), and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) for radiomics, against\\nstate-of-the-art computer vision deep learning architectures. Performance\\nmetrics across varying sample sizes reveal insights into each model's efficacy,\\nhighlighting the contexts in which specific AI approaches may offer enhanced\\ndiagnostic capabilities. The results aim to inform the integration of AI-driven\\ndiagnostic tools in clinical practice, particularly in automated and\\nhigh-throughput environments where timely, reliable diagnosis is critical. This\\ncomparative study addresses an essential gap, establishing guidance for the\\nselection of AI models based on clinical and operational needs.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T16:54:37Z\"}"}
