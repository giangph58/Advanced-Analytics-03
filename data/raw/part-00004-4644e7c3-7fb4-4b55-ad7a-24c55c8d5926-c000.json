Such dynamics does not preserve the excitation\\nnumber and leads to mixing multiple-quantum coherence matrices of orders having\\nthe same parities. Depending on the initial state, this results in\\n  generating ether all possible or only even-order multiple-quantum coherence\\nmatrices. Restoring is established via the special unitary transformation\\napplied to the receiver side of the chain (extended receiver). An example of\\nrestoring $\\\\pm1$ and $\\\\pm 2$-order coherence matrices in two-qubit state\\ntransfer is considered. Entanglement transfer in such process is also studied\\nand possibility of its amplification is demonstrated.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T12:25:01Z\"}"}
