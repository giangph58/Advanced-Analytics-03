{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14852v1\", \"title\": \"APIRAT: Integrating Multi-source API Knowledge for Enhanced Code\\n  Translation with LLMs\", \"summary\": \"Code translation is an essential task in software migration, multilingual\\ndevelopment, and system refactoring. Recent advancements in large language\\nmodels (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in this task. However,\\nprior studies have highlighted that LLMs often struggle with domain-specific\\ncode, particularly in resolving cross-lingual API mappings. To tackle this\\nchallenge, we propose APIRAT, a novel code translation method that integrates\\nmulti-source API knowledge. APIRAT employs three API knowledge augmentation\\ntechniques, including API sequence retrieval, API sequence back-translation,\\nand API mapping, to guide LLMs to translating code, ensuring both the correct\\nstructure of API sequences and the accurate usage of individual APIs. Extensive\\nexperiments on two public datasets, CodeNet and AVATAR, indicate that APIRAT\\nsignificantly surpasses existing LLM-based methods, achieving improvements in\\ncomputational accuracy ranging from 4% to 15.1%. Additionally, our evaluation\\nacross different LLMs showcases the generalizability of APIRAT. An ablation\\nstudy further confirms the individual contributions of each API knowledge\\ncomponent, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T04:24:49Z\"}"}
