These findings can also be interpreted as hidden regular variation\\nof the cluster processes' functionals, extending the results in Dombry et al.\\n(2022) to cluster processes with heavy-tailed characteristics, including mixed\\nBinomial Poisson cluster processes and Hawkes processes. Notably, by\\nrestricting to the adequate subspace of measures on D([0, 1], R+), and applying\\nthe correct normalization and scaling to the paths of the centered cumulative\\nfunctional, the limit measure concentrates on paths with multiple large jumps.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T08:26:45Z\"}"}
