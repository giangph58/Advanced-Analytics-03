Based on these discoveries, this study investigates retrograde\\nco-orbital resonances within the Earth-Moon system, focusing on both optimal\\nand sub-optimal orbital transfers to such configurations. The paper provides a\\ncomprehensive analysis of retrograde co-orbital resonances, optimization\\ntechniques to evaluate and enhance the performance of bi-impulsive transfers to\\nthese configurations. The results reveal the feasibility of low-cost transfers,\\nwhich could support a range of future missions, including space exploration and\\nsatellite deployment. Combining advanced optimization processes, we obtained\\nsolutions for orbital transfers for different arrival points in retrograde\\nco-orbitals improving mission efficiency and offering a cost-effective approach\\nto interplanetary exploration.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:10:05Z\"}"}
