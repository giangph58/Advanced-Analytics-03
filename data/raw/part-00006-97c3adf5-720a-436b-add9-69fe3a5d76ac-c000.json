{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03515v1\", \"title\": \"Clarification of the Spontaneous Polarization Direction in Crystals with\\n  Wurtzite Structure\", \"summary\": \"The wurtzite structure is one of the most frequently found crystal structures\\nin modern semiconductors and its inherent spontaneous polarization is a\\ndefining materials property. Despite this significance, confusion has been\\nrampant in the literature with respect to the orientation of the spontaneous\\npolarization inside the unit cell of the wurtzite structure, especially for the\\ntechnologically very relevant III-N compounds (AlN, GaN, InN). In particular,\\nthe spontaneous polarization has been reported to either point up or down for\\nthe same unit cell orientation, depending on the literature source - with\\nimportant implications for, e.g., the carrier type and density expected at\\ninterfaces of heterostructures involving materials with wurtzite-structure.\\nThis perspective aims to resolve this ambiguity by reviewing available reports\\non the direction of the energetically preferred polarization direction in the\\npresence of external electric fields, as well as atomically resolved scanning\\ntransmission electron microscopy images. While we use ferroelectric wurtzite\\nAlScN as a key example, our conclusions are generalizable to other compounds\\nwith the same crystal structure. We demonstrate that a metal-polar unit cell\\nmust be associated with an upward polarization vector - which is contrary to\\nlong-standing conventional wisdom.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T13:23:46Z\"}"}
