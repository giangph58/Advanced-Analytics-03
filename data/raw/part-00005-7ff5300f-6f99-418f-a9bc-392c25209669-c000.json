{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17248v1\", \"title\": \"How Jungian Cognitive Functions Explain MBTI Type Prevalence in Computer\\n  Industry Careers\", \"summary\": \"This study investigates the relationship between Carl Jung's cognitive\\nfunctions and success in computer industry careers by analyzing the\\ndistribution of Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) types among professionals in\\nthe field. Building on Carl Jung's theory of psychological types, which\\ncategorizes human cognition into four primary functions, Sensing, Intuition,\\nThinking, and Feeling, this study investigates how these functions, when\\ncombined with the attitudes of Extraversion and Introversion, influence\\npersonality types and career choices in the tech sector. Through a\\ncomprehensive analysis of data from 30 studies spanning multiple countries and\\ndecades, encompassing 18,264 individuals in computer-related professions, we\\nidentified the most prevalent cognitive functions and their combinations. After\\nnormalizing the data against general population distributions, our findings\\nshowed that individual Jungian functions (Te, Ni, Ti, Ne), dual function\\ncombinations (Ni-Te, Ti-Ne, Si-Te, Ni-Fe), and MBTI types (INTJ, ENTJ, INTP,\\nENTP, ISTJ, INFJ, ESTJ, ESTP) had significantly higher representation compared\\nto general population norms. The paper addresses gaps in the existing\\nliterature by providing a more nuanced understanding of how cognitive functions\\nimpact job performance and team dynamics, offering insights for career\\nguidance, team composition, and professional development in the computer\\nindustry, and a deeper understanding of how cognitive preferences influence\\ncareer success in technology-related fields.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T04:57:13Z\"}"}
