{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17759v1\", \"title\": \"Identity Control Plane: The Unifying Layer for Zero Trust Infrastructure\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces the Identity Control Plane (ICP), an architectural\\nframework for enforcing identity-aware Zero Trust access across human users,\\nworkloads, and automation systems. The ICP model unifies SPIFFE-based workload\\nidentity, OIDC/SAML user identity, and scoped automation credentials via\\nbroker-issued transaction tokens. We propose a composable enforcement layer\\nusing ABAC policy engines (e.g., OPA, Cedar), aligned with IETF WIMSE drafts\\nand OAuth transaction tokens. The paper includes architectural components,\\nintegration patterns, use cases, a comparative analysis with current models,\\nand theorized performance metrics. A FedRAMP and SLSA compliance mapping is\\nalso presented. This is a theoretical infrastructure architecture paper\\nintended for security researchers and platform architects. No prior version of\\nthis work has been published.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T17:21:00Z\"}"}
