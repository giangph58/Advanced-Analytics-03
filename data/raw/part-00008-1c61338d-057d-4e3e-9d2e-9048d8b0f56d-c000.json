Using the\\ntensor deconfinement technique we provide some proofs of results previously\\nclaimed in the literature about confining dualities for $SU(N)$ with two\\nantisymmetric tensors. Furthermore we study 3d confining dualities with\\nsymmetric tensors and linear monopole superpotentials. These confining\\ndualities have been obtained by applying the duplication formula for the\\nhyperbolic Gamma functions on effective dualities on $\\\\mathbb{R}^{1,2} \\\\times\\nS^1$ with $SU(N)$ gauge groups and antisymmetric tensors. We conclude the\\nanalysis providing an alternative derivation, again using the tensor\\ndeconfinement technique.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T13:56:55Z\"}"}
