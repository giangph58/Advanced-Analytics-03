Although traditional\\ndeep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have been shown to be promising,\\ntheir effectiveness is hindered by a reliance on manually designed reward\\nfunctions and inefficiencies in dynamic environments. In this paper, an inverse\\nreinforcement learning (IRL)-based framework is proposed, in which multi-head\\nself-attention (MHSA) and graph attention mechanisms are incorporated to\\nenhance reward function learning and task execution efficiency. Expert\\ndemonstrations are utilized to infer optimal reward densities, allowing\\ndependence on handcrafted designs to be reduced and adaptability to be\\nimproved. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the proposed method\\nover widely used multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms in terms\\nof both cumulative rewards and task execution efficiency.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.MA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:14:45Z\"}"}
