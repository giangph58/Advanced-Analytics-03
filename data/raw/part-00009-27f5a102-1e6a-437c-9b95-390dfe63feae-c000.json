After establishing the foundational properties of\\nthis intersection product, we investigate finite-dimensional subalgebras that\\narise naturally from this construction. These subalgebras can be regarded as\\nvolumetric analogues of the graded M\\\\\\\"obius algebra, which appears in the\\ncontext of the Dowling-Wilson conjecture. We conjecture that they also satisfy\\nthe injective hard Lefschetz property and the Hodge-Riemann relations, and we\\nprove these in degree one.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,math.MG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T12:54:07Z\"}"}
