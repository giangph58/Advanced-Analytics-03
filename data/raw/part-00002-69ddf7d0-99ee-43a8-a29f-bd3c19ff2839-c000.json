We compare our results for these three cases, showing how\\nthe hypotheses change according to the space that we are treating. Finally, we\\nprovide applications of our results to difference equations with\\nstate-dependent delays for the cases of continuous and regulated function\\nspaces, as well as to transport equations in one space dimension with\\ntime-dependent velocity.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:31:32Z\"}"}
