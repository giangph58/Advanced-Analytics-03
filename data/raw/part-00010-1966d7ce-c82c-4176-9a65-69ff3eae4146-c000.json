{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05047v1\", \"title\": \"Neural Pathways to Program Success: Hopfield Networks for PERT Analysis\", \"summary\": \"Project and task scheduling under uncertainty remains a fundamental challenge\\nin program and project management, where accurate estimation of task durations\\nand dependencies is critical for delivering complex, multi project systems. The\\nProgram Evaluation and Review Technique provides a probabilistic framework to\\nmodel task variability and critical paths. In this paper, the author presents a\\nnovel formulation of PERT scheduling as an energy minimization problem within a\\nHopfield neural network architecture. By mapping task start times and\\nprecedence constraints into a neural computation framework, the networks\\ninherent optimization dynamics is exploited to approximate globally consistent\\nschedules. The author addresses key theoretical issues related to energy\\nfunction differentiability, constraint encoding, and convergence, and extends\\nthe Hopfield model for structured precedence graphs. Numerical simulations on\\nsynthetic project networks comprising up to 1000 tasks demonstrate the\\nviability of this approach, achieving near optimal makespans with minimal\\nconstraint violations. The findings suggest that neural optimization models\\noffer a promising direction for scalable and adaptive project tasks scheduling\\nunder uncertainty in areas such as the agentic AI workflows, microservice based\\napplications that the modern AI systems are being built upon.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T08:34:16Z\"}"}
