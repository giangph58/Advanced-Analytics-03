In quantum adaptive optics, biphoton aberration correction has been\\nachieved by using classical beams to detect the aberration source or scanning\\nthe correction phase on biphotons if the source is unreachable. Here, we\\nintroduce position-correlated biphoton Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensing, where\\nthe phase pattern added on photon pairs with a strong position correlation is\\nreconstructed from their position centroid distribution at the focal plane of a\\nmicrolens array. We experimentally demonstrate this method by performing phase\\nmeasurement and adaptive imaging against the disturbance of a plastic film. Our\\nmethod involves only one measurement step, so it is a more direct approach to\\nbiphoton phase measurement with a greatly improved efficiency, suitable for\\nintegration into quantum microscopy and communication.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T12:25:26Z\"}"}
