During the first outburst episode, a detailed analysis of the\\noptical photometry shows a periodicity that evolves over time and stabilises at\\na frequency of $1.4517(1)$ $1/d$ ($\\\\sim0.5\\\\%$ longer than the orbital period).\\nThis super-orbital modulation is also seen in the X-rays for a few days soon\\nafter the transition to the high-soft state. We also observed optical\\nQuasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs), which correspond to some of the QPOs\\nobserved in X-rays at three different epochs when the source was in the\\nlow-hard state. In two epochs, optical QPOs with a centroid consistent with\\nhalf the frequency of the most prominent X-ray QPO can be seen. If the lowest\\nmodulation frequency is the one observed in the optical, the characteristic\\nprecession frequency of MAXI J1820+070 is lower than that inferred from the\\n`fundamental' QPO in the X-rays. Assuming that QPOs can be generated by\\nLense-Thirring precession, we calculate the spin of the black hole in the case\\nwhere the fundamental precession frequency is tracked by the optical emission.\\nWe find a relatively slowly spinning black hole with a spin parameter $\\\\lesssim\\n0.15$. The super-orbital optical and X-ray modulations observed after the\\ndisappearance of the QPOs may be triggered by the self-irradiation of the outer\\ndisc by a standard inner disc truncated at a few gravitational radii.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:09:56Z\"}"}
