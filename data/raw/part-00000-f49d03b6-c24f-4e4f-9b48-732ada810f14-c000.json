{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05302v1\", \"title\": \"Ionomeric extracellular matrices for dynamic soft robotic tissue\\n  engineering devices through protein sulfonation\", \"summary\": \"Conventional tissue engineering methodologies frequently depend on\\npharmacological strategies to induce or expedite tissue repair. However,\\nbioengineered strategies incorporating biophysical stimulation have emerged as\\npromising alternatives. Electroactive materials facilitate the provision of\\ncontrolled electrical, mechanical, and electromechanical stimuli, which support\\ncell proliferation and tissue remodelling. Despite their ability to supply\\nexternal electrical and mechanical stimuli to the tissue microenvironment, the\\nelectroactive polymers in use today often lack critical biochemical signals\\nessential for native-like cell-cell and cell-scaffold interactions, thereby\\nconstraining their regenerative capabilities. To address the demand for\\nbiomimetic materials that possess enhanced capabilities in promoting cell and\\ntissue stimulation, we present the development of a novel class of polymers\\ncalled ionomeric extracellular matrices (iECMs). By utilising the\\nlinker-mediated conjugation of sulfonic acid biomolecules (taurine) to the\\nbackbone of an extracellular matrix protein (collagen), we illustrate the\\npotential of iECMs as the first electromechanical actuating material platform\\nderived entirely from ECM materials, paving the way for dynamic and\\nsoft-robotic platforms for a wide range of tissue engineering applications.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.med-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.med-ph,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,q-bio.CB\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T17:59:11Z\"}"}
