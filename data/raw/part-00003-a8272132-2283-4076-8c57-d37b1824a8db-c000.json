{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14967v1\", \"title\": \"3D Gaussian Head Avatars with Expressive Dynamic Appearances by Compact\\n  Tensorial Representations\", \"summary\": \"Recent studies have combined 3D Gaussian and 3D Morphable Models (3DMM) to\\nconstruct high-quality 3D head avatars. In this line of research, existing\\nmethods either fail to capture the dynamic textures or incur significant\\noverhead in terms of runtime speed or storage space. To this end, we propose a\\nnovel method that addresses all the aforementioned demands. In specific, we\\nintroduce an expressive and compact representation that encodes texture-related\\nattributes of the 3D Gaussians in the tensorial format. We store appearance of\\nneutral expression in static tri-planes, and represents dynamic texture details\\nfor different expressions using lightweight 1D feature lines, which are then\\ndecoded into opacity offset relative to the neutral face. We further propose\\nadaptive truncated opacity penalty and class-balanced sampling to improve\\ngeneralization across different expressions. Experiments show this design\\nenables accurate face dynamic details capturing while maintains real-time\\nrendering and significantly reduces storage costs, thus broadening the\\napplicability to more scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T08:50:12Z\"}"}
