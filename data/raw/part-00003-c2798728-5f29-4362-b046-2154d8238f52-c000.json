Although\\nvarious methods have been developed, template fitting is still adopted as one\\nof the most popular approaches. Its accuracy strongly depends on the quality of\\nthe Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) templates, which can be calibrated using\\nbroadband photometric data from galaxies with known spectroscopic redshifts.\\nSuch calibration is expected to improve photometric redshift accuracy, as the\\ncalibrated templates will align with observed photometric data more closely.\\nThe upcoming China Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) is one of the Stage IV\\nsurveys, which aiming for high precision cosmological studies. To improve the\\naccuracy of photometric redshift estimation for CSST, we calibrated the CWW+KIN\\ntemplates using a perturbation algorithm with broadband photometric data from\\nthe CSST mock catalog. This calibration used a training set consisting of\\napproximately 4,500 galaxies, which is 10% of the total galaxy sample. The\\noutlier fraction and scatter of the photometric redshifts derived from the\\ncalibrated templates are 2.55% and 0.036, respectively. Compared to the CWW+KIN\\ntemplates, these values are reduced by 34% and 23%, respectively. This\\ndemonstrates that SED templates calibrated with a small training set can\\neffectively optimize photometric redshift accuracy for future large-scale\\nsurveys like CSST, especially with limited spectral training data.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T12:13:55Z\"}"}
