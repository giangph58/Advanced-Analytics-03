{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05700v1\", \"title\": \"Pose-Aware Weakly-Supervised Action Segmentation\", \"summary\": \"Understanding human behavior is an important problem in the pursuit of visual\\nintelligence. A challenge in this endeavor is the extensive and costly effort\\nrequired to accurately label action segments. To address this issue, we\\nconsider learning methods that demand minimal supervision for segmentation of\\nhuman actions in long instructional videos. Specifically, we introduce a\\nweakly-supervised framework that uniquely incorporates pose knowledge during\\ntraining while omitting its use during inference, thereby distilling pose\\nknowledge pertinent to each action component. We propose a pose-inspired\\ncontrastive loss as a part of the whole weakly-supervised framework which is\\ntrained to distinguish action boundaries more effectively. Our approach,\\nvalidated through extensive experiments on representative datasets, outperforms\\nprevious state-of-the-art (SOTA) in segmenting long instructional videos under\\nboth online and offline settings. Additionally, we demonstrate the framework's\\nadaptability to various segmentation backbones and pose extractors across\\ndifferent datasets.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T05:42:55Z\"}"}
