{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07025v1\", \"title\": \"Glossy Object Reconstruction with Cost-effective Polarized Acquisition\", \"summary\": \"The challenge of image-based 3D reconstruction for glossy objects lies in\\nseparating diffuse and specular components on glossy surfaces from captured\\nimages, a task complicated by the ambiguity in discerning lighting conditions\\nand material properties using RGB data alone. While state-of-the-art methods\\nrely on tailored and/or high-end equipment for data acquisition, which can be\\ncumbersome and time-consuming, this work introduces a scalable\\npolarization-aided approach that employs cost-effective acquisition tools. By\\nattaching a linear polarizer to readily available RGB cameras, multi-view\\npolarization images can be captured without the need for advance calibration or\\nprecise measurements of the polarizer angle, substantially reducing system\\nconstruction costs. The proposed approach represents polarimetric BRDF, Stokes\\nvectors, and polarization states of object surfaces as neural implicit fields.\\nThese fields, combined with the polarizer angle, are retrieved by optimizing\\nthe rendering loss of input polarized images. By leveraging fundamental\\nphysical principles for the implicit representation of polarization rendering,\\nour method demonstrates superiority over existing techniques through\\nexperiments in public datasets and real captured images on both reconstruction\\nand novel view synthesis.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T16:38:51Z\"}"}
