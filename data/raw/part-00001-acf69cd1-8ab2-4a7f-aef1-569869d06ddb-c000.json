Moreover, there is a lack of effective\\nTD methods that preserve both reputation and data privacy. To address these\\nissues, a Reputation and Data Privacy-Preserving based Truth Discovery\\n(RDPP-TD) scheme is proposed to obtain high-quality data for MCS. The RDPP-TD\\nscheme consists of two key approaches: a Reputation-based Truth Discovery (RTD)\\napproach, which integrates the weight of current-round data with workers'\\nreputation values to estimate the truth, thereby achieving more accurate\\nresults, and a Reputation and Data Privacy-Preserving (RDPP) approach, which\\nensures privacy preservation for sensing data and reputation values. First, the\\nRDPP approach, when seamlessly integrated with RTD, can effectively evaluate\\nthe reliability of workers and their sensing data in a privacy-preserving\\nmanner. Second, the RDPP scheme supports reputation-based worker recruitment\\nand rewards, ensuring high-quality data collection while incentivizing workers\\nto provide accurate information. Comprehensive theoretical analysis and\\nextensive experiments based on real-world datasets demonstrate that the\\nproposed RDPP-TD scheme provides strong privacy protection and improves data\\nquality by up to 33.3%.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CE\", \"categories\": \"cs.CE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T12:20:55Z\"}"}
