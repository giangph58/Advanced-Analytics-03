{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06083v1\", \"title\": \"Security Analysis of Thumbnail-Preserving Image Encryption and a New\\n  Framework\", \"summary\": \"As a primary encryption primitive balancing the privacy and searchability of\\ncloud storage images, thumbnail preserving encryption (TPE) enables users to\\nquickly identify the privacy personal image on the cloud and request this image\\nfrom the owner through a secure channel. In this paper, we have found that two\\ndifferent plaintext images may produce the same thumbnail. It results in the\\nfailure of search strategy because the collision of thumbnail occurs. To\\naddress this serious security issues, we conduct an in-depth analysis on the\\ncollision probabilities of thumbnails, and then propose a new TPE framework,\\ncalled multi-factor thumbnail preserving encryption (MFTPE). It starts from the\\ncollision probability of two blocks, extend to the probabilities of two images\\nand ultimately to N images. Then, we in detail describe three specific MFTPE\\nconstructions preserving different combinations of factors, i.e., the sum and\\nthe geometric mean, the sum and the range, and the sum and the weighted mean.\\nThe theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MFTPE\\nreduces the probability of thumbnails, exhibits strong robustness, and also\\neffectively resists face detection and noise attacks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.MM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:24:43Z\"}"}
