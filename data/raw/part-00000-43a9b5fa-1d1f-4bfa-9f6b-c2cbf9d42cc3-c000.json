Using template\\nimage matching with differential evolution optimization, we identify the most\\nsimilar 2D plane in 3D. The method is validated on a synthetic porous medium,\\nachieving exact registration, and applied to Berea sandstone, where it achieves\\na structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.990. With the registered images, we\\nexplore upscaling properties based on paired multimodal images, focusing on\\npore characteristics and effective elastic moduli. The thin-section image\\nreveals 50 % more porosity and submicron pores than the registered CT plane. In\\naddition, bulk and shear moduli from thin sections are 25 % and 30 % lower,\\nrespectively, than those derived from CT images. Beyond numerical comparisons,\\nthin sections provide additional geological insights, including cementation,\\nmineral phases, and weathering effects, which are not clear in CT images. This\\nstudy demonstrates the potential of multimodal image registration to improve\\ncomputed rock properties in digital rock physics by integrating complementary\\nimaging modalities.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.geo-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.geo-ph,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T06:01:43Z\"}"}
