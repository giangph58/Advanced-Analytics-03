One CDW state that breaks time-reversal symmetry\\nwas proposed in this compound, while the exact nature of the putative magnetic\\nstate remains elusive. To examine the thermodynamic state of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and\\nassess the character of the associated magnetism, we conducted tuning fork\\nresonator measurements of magnetotropic susceptibility over a broad range of\\nangles, magnetic fields, and temperature. We found a cascade of phase\\ntransition in the CDW phase. Of particular interest is a highly anisotropic\\nmagnetic structure that arises below about 30~K, with a magnetic moment along\\nthe $c$-axis that has an extremely small magnitude. This magnetic state\\ndemonstrates extremely slow dynamics and small saturate field, all suggest that\\nelectronic phase below 30~K breaks time reversal symmetry and has an\\nunconventional origin.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T11:42:27Z\"}"}
