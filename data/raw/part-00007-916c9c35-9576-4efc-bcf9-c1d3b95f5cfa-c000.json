The phases (and accompanying CFTs) we consider come\\nin two types - bosonic phases that are defined on unorientable manifolds and\\nfermionic phases that are sensitive to a $\\\\text{Pin}^-$ structure. In both\\ncases, our analysis leads to eight phase diagrams, with the two sets of eight\\nconnected by fermionization/bosonization. Starting from a seed CFT, we obtain\\nthe CFT that governs each transition. Many of these exhibit symmetry enriched\\ncriticality. In addition to showing many symmetry enriched CFTs in their\\nnatural habitats, our work discusses the fermionic analogs of the\\n$\\\\mathbb{Z}_2$ bosonic operations, which we have not seen discussed in the\\nliterature.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:45:14Z\"}"}
