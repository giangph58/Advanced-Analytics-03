{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00602v1\", \"title\": \"Irregularity and Topological Indices in Fibonacci Word Trees and\\n  Modified Fibonacci Word Index\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces the concept of the Fibonacci Word Index\\n$\\\\operatorname{FWI}$, a novel topological index derived from the Albertson\\nindex, applied to trees constructed from Fibonacci words. Building upon the\\nclassical Fibonacci sequence and its generalizations, we explore the structural\\nproperties of Fibonacci word trees and their degree-based irregularity\\nmeasures. We define the $\\\\operatorname{FWI}$ and its variants, including the\\ntotal irregularity and modified Fibonacci Word Index where it defined as \\\\[\\n\\\\operatorname{FWI}^*(T)=\\\\sum_{n,m\\\\in E(\\\\mathscr{T})}[deg F_n^2-deg F_m^2], \\\\]\\nand establish foundational inequalities relating these indices to the maximum\\ndegree of the underlying trees. Our results extend known graph invariants to\\nthe combinatorial setting of Fibonacci words, providing new insights into their\\nalgebraic and topological characteristics.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T15:34:48Z\"}"}
