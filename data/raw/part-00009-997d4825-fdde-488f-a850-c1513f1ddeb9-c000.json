{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04208v1\", \"title\": \"Diffusion in a wedge geometry: First-Passage Statistics under Stochastic\\n  Resetting\", \"summary\": \"We study the diffusion process in the presence of stochastic resetting inside\\na two-dimensional wedge of top angle $\\\\alpha$, bounded by two infinite\\nabsorbing edges. In the absence of resetting, the second moment of the\\nfirst-passage time diverges for $\\\\alpha>\\\\pi/4$ while it remains finite for\\n$\\\\alpha<\\\\pi/4$, resulting in an unbounded or bounded coefficient of variation\\nin the respective angular regimes. Upon introducing stochastic resetting, we\\nanalyze the first-passage properties in both cases and identify the geometric\\nconfigurations in which resetting consistently enhances the rate of absorption\\nor escape through the boundaries. By deriving the expressions for the\\nprobability currents and conditional first-passage quantities such as splitting\\nprobabilities and conditional mean first-passage times, we demonstrate how\\nresetting can be employed to bias the escape pathway through the favorable\\nboundary. Our theoretical predictions are verified through Langevin-type\\nnumerical simulations, showing excellent agreement.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:01:54Z\"}"}
