Three specialized agents collaborate\\nin sequence: Agent1 uses an LLM to craft coherent, culturally grounded\\nscripts;Agent2 employs visual generation models to render contextually accurate\\nstage scenes; and Agent3 leverages TTS to produce synchronized, emotionally\\nexpressive vocal performances. In a case study on Dou E Yuan, the system\\nachieved expert ratings of 3.8 for script fidelity, 3.5 for visual coherence,\\nand 3.8 for speech accuracy-culminating in an overall score of 3.6, a 0.3 point\\nimprovement over a Single Agent baseline. Ablation experiments demonstrate that\\nremoving Agent2 or Agent3 leads to drops of 0.4 and 0.5 points, respectively,\\nunderscoring the value of modular collaboration. This work showcases how AI\\ndriven pipelines can streamline and scale the preservation of traditional\\nperforming arts, and points toward future enhancements in cross modal\\nalignment, richer emotional nuance, and support for additional opera genres.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T03:14:29Z\"}"}
