To this end, we first estimate a\\nsubspace based on all received symbols (pilot and payload) to provide\\nadditional information for subsequent channel estimation. We show how this\\nadditional information enhances minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel\\nestimation. Two variants of the linear MMSE (LMMSE) estimator are formulated,\\nwhere the first one solves the estimation within the subspace, and the second\\none uses a subspace projection as a preprocessing step. Theoretical derivations\\nshow the superior estimation performance of the latter method in terms of mean\\nsquare error for uncorrelated Rayleigh fading. Subsequently, we introduce\\nparameterizations of this semi-blind LMMSE estimator based on two different\\nconditional Gaussian latent models, i.e., the Gaussian mixture model and the\\nvariational autoencoder. Both models learn the underlying channel distribution\\nof the propagation environment based on training data and serve as generative\\npriors for semi-blind channel estimation. Extensive simulations for real-world\\nmeasurement data and spatial channel models show the superior performance of\\nthe proposed methods compared to state-of-the-art semi-blind channel estimators\\nwith respect to the MSE.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:01:27Z\"}"}
