{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17465v1\", \"title\": \"On soliton resolution to Cauchy problem of the spin-1 Gross-Pitaevskii\\n  equation\", \"summary\": \"We investigate the Cauchy problem for the spin-1 Gross-Pitaevskii(GP)\\nequation, which is a model instrumental in characterizing the soliton dynamics\\nwithin spinor Bose-Einstein condensates. Recently, Geng $etal.$ (Commun. Math.\\nPhys. 382, 585-611 (2021)) reported the long-time asymptotic result with error\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\frac{\\\\log t}t)$ for the spin-1 GP equation that only exists in\\nthe continuous spectrum. The main purpose of our work is to further generalize\\nand improve Geng's work. Compared with the previous work, our asymptotic error\\naccuracy has been improved from $\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\frac{\\\\log t}t)$ to\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}(t^{-3/4})$. More importantly, by establishing two matrix valued\\nfunctions, we obtained effective asymptotic errors and successfully constructed\\nasymptotic analysis of the spin-1 GP equation based on the characteristics of\\nthe spectral problem, including two cases: (i)coexistence of discrete and\\ncontinuous spectrum; (ii)only continuous spectrum which considered by Geng's\\nwork with error $\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\frac{\\\\log t}t)$. For the case (i), the\\ncorresponding asymptotic approximations can be characterized with an\\n$N$-soliton as well as an interaction term between soliton solutions and the\\ndispersion term with diverse residual error order $\\\\mathcal{O}(t^{-3/4})$. For\\nthe case (ii), the corresponding asymptotic approximations can be characterized\\nwith the leading term on the continuous spectrum and the residual error order\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}(t^{-3/4})$. Finally, our results confirm the soliton resolution\\nconjecture for the spin-1 GP equation.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math-ph,math.MP,nlin.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T11:57:49Z\"}"}
