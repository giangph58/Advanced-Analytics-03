In enterprise environments like SAP HANA Cloud\\nsystems, this task often involves monitoring high-dimensional, multivariate\\ntime series (MTS) derived from telemetry and log data. With the advent of\\nquantum machine learning offering efficient calculations in high-dimensional\\nlatent spaces, many avenues open for dealing with such complex data. One\\napproach is the Quantum Autoencoder (QAE), an emerging and promising method\\nwith potential for application in both data compression and AD. However, prior\\napplications of QAEs to time series AD have been restricted to univariate data,\\nlimiting their relevance for real-world enterprise systems. In this work, we\\nintroduce a novel QAE-based framework designed specifically for MTS AD towards\\nenterprise scale. We theoretically develop and experimentally validate the\\narchitecture, demonstrating that our QAE achieves performance competitive with\\nneural-network-based autoencoders while requiring fewer trainable parameters.\\nWe evaluate our model on datasets that closely reflect SAP system telemetry and\\nshow that the proposed QAE is a viable and efficient alternative for\\nsemisupervised AD in real-world enterprise settings.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.CR,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T13:40:06Z\"}"}
