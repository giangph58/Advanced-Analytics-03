{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05200v1\", \"title\": \"Affine hypersurfaces and superintegrable systems\", \"summary\": \"It was recently shown that under mild assumptions second-order conformally\\nsuperintegrable systems can be encoded in a $(0,3)$-tensor, called structure\\ntensor. For abundant systems, this approach led to algebraic integrability\\nconditions that essentially allow one to restore a system from the knowledge of\\nits structure tensor in a point on the manifold. Here we study the geometric\\nstructure formalising such systems, which we call an abundant manifold. The\\nunderlying Riemannian manifold is necessarily conformally flat. We establish a\\ncorrespondence between these superintegrable systems and the geometry of affine\\nhypersurfaces. More precisely, we show that abundant manifolds correspond to\\ncertain non-degenerate relative affine hypersurfaces normalisations in $\\\\mathbb\\nR^{n+1}$ ($n\\\\ge 2$). We also formulate the necessary and sufficient conditions\\nnon-degenerate relative affine hypersurface normalisations in $\\\\mathbb R^{n+1}$\\nneed to satisfy, if they arise from abundant manifolds. These relative affine\\nhypersurface normalisations are called abundant hypersurface normalisations.\\nBoth for abundant manifolds and for relative affine hypersurface normalisations\\na natural concept of conformal equivalence can be defined. We prove that they\\nare compatible, permitting us to identify conformal classes of abundant\\nmanifolds with abundant hypersurface immersions (without specified\\nnormalisation).\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T15:50:26Z\"}"}
