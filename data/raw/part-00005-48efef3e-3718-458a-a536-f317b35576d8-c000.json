{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09909v1\", \"title\": \"Quantum Natural Language Processing: A Comprehensive Review of Models,\\n  Methods, and Applications\", \"summary\": \"In recent developments, deep learning methodologies applied to Natural\\nLanguage Processing (NLP) have revealed a paradox: They improve performance but\\ndemand considerable data and resources for their training. Alternatively,\\nquantum computing exploits the principles of quantum mechanics to overcome the\\ncomputational limitations of current methodologies, thereby establishing an\\nemerging field known as quantum natural language processing (QNLP). This domain\\nholds the potential to attain a quantum advantage in the processing of\\nlinguistic structures, surpassing classical models in both efficiency and\\naccuracy. In this paper, it is proposed to categorise QNLP models based on\\nquantum computing principles, architecture, and computational approaches. This\\npaper attempts to provide a survey on how quantum meets language by mapping\\nstate-of-the-art in this area, embracing quantum encoding techniques for\\nclassical data, QNLP models for prevalent NLP tasks, and quantum optimisation\\ntechniques for hyper parameter tuning. The landscape of quantum computing\\napproaches applied to various NLP tasks is summarised by showcasing the\\nspecific QNLP methods used, and the popularity of these methods is indicated by\\ntheir count. From the findings, it is observed that QNLP approaches are still\\nlimited to small data sets, with only a few models explored extensively, and\\nthere is increasing interest in the application of quantum computing to natural\\nlanguage processing tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T06:09:26Z\"}"}
