{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07923v1\", \"title\": \"Trading Graph Neural Network\", \"summary\": \"This paper proposes a new algorithm -- Trading Graph Neural Network (TGNN)\\nthat can structurally estimate the impact of asset features, dealer features\\nand relationship features on asset prices in trading networks. It combines the\\nstrength of the traditional simulated method of moments (SMM) and recent\\nmachine learning techniques -- Graph Neural Network (GNN). It outperforms\\nexisting reduced-form methods with network centrality measures in prediction\\naccuracy. The method can be used on networks with any structure, allowing for\\nheterogeneity among both traders and assets.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.TR\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.TR,cs.LG,econ.GN,q-fin.EC,q-fin.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:40:31Z\"}"}
