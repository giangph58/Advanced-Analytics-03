{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06806v1\", \"title\": \"Mass Balance Approximation of Unfolding Improves Potential-Like Methods\\n  for Protein Stability Predictions\", \"summary\": \"The prediction of protein stability changes following single-point mutations\\nplays a pivotal role in computational biology, particularly in areas like drug\\ndiscovery, enzyme reengineering, and genetic disease analysis. Although\\ndeep-learning strategies have pushed the field forward, their use in standard\\nworkflows remains limited due to resource demands. Conversely, potential-like\\nmethods are fast, intuitive, and efficient. Yet, these typically estimate Gibbs\\nfree energy shifts without considering the free-energy variations in the\\nunfolded protein state, an omission that may breach mass balance and diminish\\naccuracy. This study shows that incorporating a mass-balance correction (MBC)\\nto account for the unfolded state significantly enhances these methods. While\\nmany machine learning models partially model this balance, our analysis\\nsuggests that a refined representation of the unfolded state may improve the\\npredictive performance.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.QM\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.QM,cs.LG,physics.bio-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T11:53:02Z\"}"}
