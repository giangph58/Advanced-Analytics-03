However, parameter\\nestimation in ODE models is challenging due to the multimodal nature of the\\nlikelihood function, which can lead to local optima and unstable inference. In\\nthis paper, we propose particle data cloning (PDC), a novel approach that\\nenhances global optimization by leveraging data cloning and annealed sequential\\nMonte Carlo (ASMC). PDC mitigates multimodality by refining the likelihood\\nthrough data clones and progressively extracting information from the sharpened\\nposterior. Compared to standard data cloning, PDC provides more reliable\\nfrequentist inference and demonstrates superior global optimization\\nperformance. We offer practical guidelines for efficient implementation and\\nillustrate the method through simulation studies and an application to a\\nprey-predator ODE model. Our implementation is available at\\nhttps://github.com/SONDONGHUI/PDC.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.CO\", \"categories\": \"stat.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T07:46:08Z\"}"}
