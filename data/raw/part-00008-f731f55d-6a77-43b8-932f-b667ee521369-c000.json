In this paper, we introduce a\\nmixed-initiative framework for AI assisted decision making that is grounded in\\nthe data-frame theory of sensemaking and the evaluative AI paradigm. Our\\napproach enables both humans and AI to collaboratively construct, validate, and\\nadapt hypotheses. We demonstrate our framework with an AI-assisted skin cancer\\ndiagnosis prototype that leverages a concept bottleneck model to facilitate\\ninterpretable interactions and dynamic updates to diagnostic hypotheses.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T13:36:06Z\"}"}
