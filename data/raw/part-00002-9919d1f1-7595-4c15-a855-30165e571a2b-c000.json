We find that currents in the\\nboundary have combinatorial restrictions on self-intersection which depend on\\n$n$. We define a notion of dual space to an oriented geodesic current, and show\\nthat the dual space of a discrete boundary current of the\\n$\\\\text{SL}_n\\\\mathbb{R}$ Hitchin component is a polyhedral complex of dimension\\nat most $n-1$. For endpoints of cubic differential rays in the\\n$\\\\text{SL}_3\\\\mathbb{R}$ Hitchin component, the dual space is the universal\\ncover of $S$, equipped with an asymmetric Finsler metric which records growth\\nrates of trace functions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GT\", \"categories\": \"math.GT,math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T17:56:19Z\"}"}
