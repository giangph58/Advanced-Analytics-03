{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05964v1\", \"title\": \"Context-aware Rate Adaptation for Predictive Flying Networks using\\n  Contextual Bandits\", \"summary\": \"The increasing complexity of wireless technologies, such as Wi-Fi, presents\\nsignificant challenges for Rate Adaptation (RA) due to the large configuration\\nspace of transmission parameters. While extensive research has been conducted\\non RA for low-mobility networks, existing solutions fail to adapt in flying\\nnetworks, where high mobility and dynamic wireless conditions introduce\\nadditional uncertainty.\\n  We propose Linear Upper Confidence Bound for RA (LinRA), a novel Contextual\\nBandit-based approach that leverages real-time link context to optimize\\ntransmission rates. Designed for predictive flying networks, where future\\ntrajectories are known, LinRA proactively adapts to obstacles affecting channel\\nquality. Simulation results demonstrate that LinRA converges\\n$\\\\mathbf{5.2\\\\times}$ faster than state-of-the-art benchmarks and improves\\nthroughput by 80\\\\% in Non Line-of-Sight (NLoS) conditions, matching the\\nperformance of ideal algorithms. With low time complexity, LinRA is a scalable\\nand efficient RA solution for predictive flying networks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:23:20Z\"}"}
