{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15139v1\", \"title\": \"GIFDL: Generated Image Fluctuation Distortion Learning for Enhancing\\n  Steganographic Security\", \"summary\": \"Minimum distortion steganography is currently the mainstream method for\\nmodification-based steganography. A key issue in this method is how to define\\nsteganographic distortion. With the rapid development of deep learning\\ntechnology, the definition of distortion has evolved from manual design to deep\\nlearning design. Concurrently, rapid advancements in image generation have made\\ngenerated images viable as cover media. However, existing distortion design\\nmethods based on machine learning do not fully leverage the advantages of\\ngenerated cover media, resulting in suboptimal security performance. To address\\nthis issue, we propose GIFDL (Generated Image Fluctuation Distortion Learning),\\na steganographic distortion learning method based on the fluctuations in\\ngenerated images. Inspired by the idea of natural steganography, we take a\\nseries of highly similar fluctuation images as the input to the steganographic\\ndistortion generator and introduce a new GAN training strategy to disguise\\nstego images as fluctuation images. Experimental results demonstrate that\\nGIFDL, compared with state-of-the-art GAN-based distortion learning methods,\\nexhibits superior resistance to steganalysis, increasing the detection error\\nrates by an average of 3.30% across three steganalyzers.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T14:43:00Z\"}"}
