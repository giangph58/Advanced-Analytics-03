Using fully kinetic 2D and 3D particle-in-cell\\nsimulations, we show that interesting optical phenomena emerge, including the\\ngeneration of harmonic beams that are anomalously polarized orthongal to the\\ndriver, harmonic spectrum variation depending on the incident laser\\npolarization, and a deflection of transmitted lights that leads to a tilted\\nharmonic intensity pattern. It is shown these anomalous effects are associated\\nwith complex peripheral electron dynamics on the plasma vacuum interface. To\\naccount for these effects, a new theoretical model is developed to calculate\\nharmonic fields from arbitrary 2D electron motion within the diffraction plane,\\nthe results agree well with the simulations. Our model indicates that the\\noptical properties of the harmonic beams are determined by the 2D in-plane\\nelectron motion, which can be leveraged to provide immense opportunities for\\nmanipulating light-matter interaction at relativistic intensities.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T05:35:05Z\"}"}
