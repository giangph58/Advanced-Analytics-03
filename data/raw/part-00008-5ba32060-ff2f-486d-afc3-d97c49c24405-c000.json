Arai et al. (2017) derived a\\nmathematical expression for LRM strategies in BNS models using Malliavin\\ncalculus for L\\\\'evy processes and presented some numerical results only for the\\ncase where the asset price process is a martingale. Subsequently, Arai and Imai\\n(2024) developed the first Monte Carlo (MC) method available for non-martingale\\nBNS models with infinite active jumps. Here, we modify the expression obtained\\nby Arai et al. (2017) into a numerically tractable form, and, using the MC\\nmethod developed by Arai and Imai (2024), propose a numerical method of LRM\\nstrategies available for non-martingale BNS models with infinite active jumps.\\nIn the final part of this paper, we will conduct some numerical experiments.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.CP\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.CP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T02:41:11Z\"}"}
