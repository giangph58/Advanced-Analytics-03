{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19562v1\", \"title\": \"CGM cloud sizes from refractive FRB scattering\", \"summary\": \"We explore constraints on the size of cool gas clouds in the circumgalactic\\nmedium (CGM) obtainable from the presence, or lack thereof, of refractive\\nscattering in fast radio bursts (FRBs). Our refractive analysis sets the most\\nconservative bounds on parsec-scale CGM clumpiness as it does not make\\nassumptions about the turbulent density cascade. We find that the bulk of\\nlow-redshift cool CGM gas, constrained to have densities of $n_{\\\\rm e} \\\\lesssim\\n10^{-2}\\\\,{\\\\rm cm^{-3}}$, likely cannot produce two refractive images and,\\nhence, scattering. It is only for extremely small cloud sizes $\\\\lesssim 0.1$ pc\\n(about a hundred times smaller than the so-called shattering scale) that such\\ndensities could result in detectable scattering. Dense $n_{\\\\rm e} \\\\gtrsim\\n0.1\\\\,{\\\\rm cm^{-3}}$ gas with shattering-scale cloud sizes is more likely to\\ninhabit the inner several kiloparsecs of the low-redshift CGM: such clouds\\nwould result in multiple refractive images and large scattering times $\\\\gtrsim\\n1 - 10$ ms, but a small fraction FRB sightlines are likely to be affected. We\\nargue that such large scattering times from an intervening CGM would be a\\nsignature of sub-parsec clouds, even if diffractive scattering from turbulence\\ncontributes to the overall scattering. At redshift $z\\\\sim 3$, we estimate $\\\\sim\\n0.1\\\\%$ of FRBs to intersect massive proto-clusters, which may be the most\\nlikely place to see scattering owing to their ubiquitous $n_{\\\\rm e} \\\\approx\\n1\\\\,{\\\\rm cm^{-3}}$ cold gas. While much of our discussion assumes a single cloud\\nsize, we show similar results hold for a CGM cloud-size distribution motivated\\nby hydrodynamic simulations.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T08:15:48Z\"}"}
