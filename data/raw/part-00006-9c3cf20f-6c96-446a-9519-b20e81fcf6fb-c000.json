{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07857v1\", \"title\": \"$B$ meson semileptonic decays from lattice QCD\", \"summary\": \"$B$ processes are a rich source of potential anomalies that could lead to the\\ndiscovery of BSM physics. The long-standing tension between the inclusive and\\nthe exclusive determinations of the CKM matrix elements $|V_{xb}|$, or the\\ncurrent tensions in the $R(D)$-$R(D^\\\\ast)$ plane are some examples of active\\nareas of research where we might find signals of new physics. Heavy-to-heavy\\n$B$ semileptonic decays, $B_{(s)}\\\\to D^{(\\\\ast)}_{(s)}\\\\ell\\\\nu$, and in\\nparticular, decays with a vector product ($D^\\\\ast_{(s)}$) are especially\\ninteresting from an experimental point of view, but experiment and theory must\\nwalk together in order to reach conclusions in the intensity frontier. In this\\nreview I talk about the current status of the lattice-QCD calculations of the\\n$B\\\\to D^{\\\\ast}\\\\ell\\\\nu$ form factors at non-zero recoil, I discuss the\\nimplications they have for the determination of $B$ anomalies, and finally I\\ngive some hints of what we can expect from future calculations.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-lat\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:32:23Z\"}"}
