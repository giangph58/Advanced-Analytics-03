{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20536v1\", \"title\": \"Starfish: Rebalancing Multi-Party Off-Chain Payment Channels\", \"summary\": \"Blockchain technology has revolutionized the way transactions are executed,\\nbut scalability remains a major challenge. Payment Channel Network (PCN), as a\\nLayer-2 scaling solution, has been proposed to address this issue. However,\\nskewed payments can deplete the balance of one party within a channel,\\nrestricting the ability of PCNs to transact through a path and subsequently\\nreducing the transaction success rate. To address this issue, the technology of\\nrebalancing has been proposed. However, existing rebalancing strategies in PCNs\\nare limited in their capacity and efficiency. Cycle-based approaches only\\naddress rebalancing within groups of nodes that form a cycle network, while\\nnon-cycle-based approaches face high complexity of on-chain operations and\\nlimitations on rebalancing capacity. In this study, we propose Starfish, a\\nrebalancing approach that captures the star-shaped network structure to provide\\nhigh rebalancing efficiency and large channel capacity. Starfish requires only\\n$N$-time on-chain operations to connect independent channels and aggregate the\\ntotal budget of all channels. To demonstrate the correctness and advantages of\\nour method, we provide a formal security proof of the Starfish protocol and\\nconduct comparative experiments with existing rebalancing techniques.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T08:30:33Z\"}"}
