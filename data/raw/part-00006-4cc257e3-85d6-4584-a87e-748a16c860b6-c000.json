{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02650v1\", \"title\": \"Investigating Simple Drawings of $K_n$ using SAT\", \"summary\": \"We present a SAT framework which allows to investigate properties of simple\\ndrawings of the complete graph $K_n$ using the power of AI. In contrast to\\nclassic imperative programming, where a program is operated step by step, our\\nframework models mathematical questions as Boolean formulas which are then\\nsolved using modern SAT solvers. Our framework for simple drawings is based on\\na characterization via rotation systems and finite forbidden substructures. We\\nshowcase its universality by addressing various open problems, reproving\\nprevious computational results and deriving several new computational results.\\nIn particular, we test and progress on several unavoidable configurations such\\nas variants of Rafla's conjecture on plane Hamiltonian cycles, Harborth's\\nconjecture on empty triangles, and crossing families for general simple\\ndrawings as well as for various subclasses. Moreover, based our computational\\nresults we propose some new challenging conjectures.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CG\", \"categories\": \"cs.CG,cs.DM,math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:48:47Z\"}"}
