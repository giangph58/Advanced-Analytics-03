We\\nintroduce its virtual group algebra, a completion of the conventional group\\nalgebra $\\\\mathbb C[S(\\\\infty)]$. The virtual group algebra is obtained by taking\\nlarge-$n$ limits of the finite-dimensional group algebras $\\\\mathbb C[S(n)]$ in\\nthe so-called tame representations of $S(\\\\infty)$. We establish a connection\\nwith the centralizer construction of Molev-Olshanski [J. Algebra, 237 (2001),\\n302-341; arXiv:math/0002165] and Drinfeld-Lusztig degenerate affine Hecke\\nalgebras. This makes it possible to describe the structure of the virtual group\\nalgebra. Then we extend the results to wreath products $G\\\\wr S(\\\\infty)$ with\\narbitrary finite groups $G$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RT\", \"categories\": \"math.RT,math.RA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T09:00:58Z\"}"}
