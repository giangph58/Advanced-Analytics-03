Current databases show limitations in enabling\\nsuch task. This paper discusses the architecture of Siren Federate, a system\\nthat efficiently supports exploratory graph analysis by bridging\\ndocument-oriented, relational and graph models. Technical contributions include\\ndistributed join algorithms, adaptive query planning, query plan folding,\\nsemantic caching, and semi-join decomposition for path query. Semi-join\\ndecomposition addresses the exponential growth of intermediate results in\\npath-based queries. Experiments show that Siren Federate exhibits low latency\\nand scales well with the amount of data, the number of users, and the number of\\ncomputing nodes.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:52:03Z\"}"}
