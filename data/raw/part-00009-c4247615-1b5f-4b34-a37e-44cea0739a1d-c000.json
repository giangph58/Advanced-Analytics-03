{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00407v1\", \"title\": \"Multiple generation star formation in Cepheus Flare\", \"summary\": \"We present an analysis of the young stellar moving group ASCC 127 using Gaia\\nDR3 data, significantly expanding its membership to 3,971 stars -- double the\\nnumber identified in previous studies. Using kinematic and distance criteria,\\nASCC 127 is divided into five subgroups (Groups 1-5) with ages spanning from 15\\nto 32 Myr. Groups 1-5 are spatially linked to the Cepheus Flare star-forming\\nregion, revealing potential evidence of four sequential star formation episodes\\nat approximately 32 Myr, 20 Myr, 15 Myr, and 7 Myr. Through dust and gas\\nmapping, we identify a spatial cavity extending several tens of parsecs, which\\nmay have resulted from feedback processes such as supernovae associated with\\nearlier generations of stars in the region. This structure, along with the\\nlarger Loop III feature, indicates that feedback from massive stars likely\\ninfluenced the interstellar medium (ISM). By integrating young stellar\\npopulations with ISM studies, we provide a detailed picture of the\\nfeedback-driven star formation history in the Cepheus Flare region.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T08:57:34Z\"}"}
