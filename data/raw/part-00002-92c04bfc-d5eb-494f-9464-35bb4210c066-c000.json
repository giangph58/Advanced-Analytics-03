As with most of these challenges, there is a harsh dilemma\\nbetween the expressive power of the language used, and the tractability of the\\ncomputational problem posed by reasoning. Inspired by human reasoning, we\\nintroduce a method of first-order relational probabilistic inference that\\nsatisfies both criteria, and can handle hybrid (discrete and continuous)\\nvariables. Specifically, we extend sum-of-squares logic of expectation to\\nrelational settings, demonstrating that lifted reasoning in the bounded-degree\\nfragment for knowledge bases of bounded quantifier rank can be performed in\\npolynomial time, even with an a priori unknown and/or countably infinite set of\\nobjects. Crucially, our notion of tractability is framed in proof-theoretic\\nterms, which extends beyond the syntactic properties of the language or\\nqueries. We are able to derive the tightest bounds provable by proofs of a\\ngiven degree and size and establish completeness in our sum-of-squares\\nrefutations for fixed degrees.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T04:14:03Z\"}"}
