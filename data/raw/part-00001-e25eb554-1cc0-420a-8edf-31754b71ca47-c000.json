These functions provide a unified\\nframework for defining topology, uniformity, and diffeology. The framework is\\nbased on a family of metric-like functions originally introduced for spaces of\\nsubmanifolds. We show that the topologies, uniformities, and diffeologies of\\nthese spaces can be systematically derived from the proposed axioms.\\nFurthermore, the framework covers examples such as spaces with compact-open\\ntopologies, tiling spaces, and spaces of graphs, which have appeared in\\ndifferent contexts. These results support the study of spaces with metric-like\\nstructures from both topological and diffeological perspectives.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GN\", \"categories\": \"math.GN,math.MG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T14:02:25Z\"}"}
