In this paper, we investigate light propagation in a spin-degenerate\\nmedium using a field-theoretical approach and introduce an effective gauge\\nfield A_s that emerges from the localization of dual symmetry. Within the\\ngeometric optics approximation, we show that the helical trajectory of light\\nrays reveals this gauge field as a manifestation of spin-orbit coupling.\\nAlthough orbital-orbit coupling also arises in such systems, the spin-orbit\\ninteraction possesses deeper physical significance, as it originates from the\\nintrinsic dual symmetry embedded in Maxwell's equations.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T05:43:36Z\"}"}
