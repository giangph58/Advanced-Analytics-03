However, many popular methods are prone to random walk behavior,\\ni.e., diffusion-like exploration of the sample space, leading to slow mixing\\nthat requires intricate tuning to alleviate. Non-reversible samplers can\\nresolve some of these issues. We introduce a device that turns jump processes\\nthat satisfy a skew-detailed balance condition for a reference measure into a\\nprocess that samples a target measure that is absolutely continuous with\\nrespect to the reference measure. The resulting sampler is rejection-free,\\nnon-reversible, and continuous-time. As an example, we apply the device to\\nHamiltonian dynamics discretized by the leapfrog integrator, resulting in a\\nrejection-free non-reversible continuous-time version of Hamiltonian Monte\\nCarlo (HMC). We prove the geometric ergodicity of the resulting sampler under\\ncertain convexity conditions, and demonstrate its qualitatively different\\nbehavior to HMC through numerical examples.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.CO,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T15:45:04Z\"}"}
