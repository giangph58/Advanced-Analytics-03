{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19844v1\", \"title\": \"Tunable Topological Superconductivity by Fully Compensated Ferrimagnets\", \"summary\": \"We propose a platform based on a fully compensated ferrimagnet (fFIM) for\\nrealizing and controlling topological superconductivity with Majorana bound\\nstates across multiple dimensions. Through symmetry analysis and microscopic\\nmodeling, we demonstrate that fFIM-based heterostructures host (i) Majorana\\nzero modes localized at the ends of one-dimensional nanowires, (ii) chiral\\nMajorana edge states along two-dimensional boundaries, and (iii) tunable\\nMajorana corner modes in higher-order topological phases. The unique properties\\nof fFIMs enable an electric field to drive topological superconductivity phase\\ntransitions and N\\\\'eel vector orientation to control the spatial distribution\\nof Majorana modes, without external magnetic fields. Crucially, the absence of\\nnet magnetization in fFIM-based heterostructures preserves superconductivity,\\ncircumventing the usual trade-off between tunability and superconducting\\ncoherence in magnetized systems. Our results establish fFIM-based\\nheterostructures as a versatile platform for tunable topological\\nsuperconductivity.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:43:05Z\"}"}
