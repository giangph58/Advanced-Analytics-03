Over the\\nyears, several different type systems for concurrent processes that ensure\\ndeadlock freedom have been proposed; this diversity raises the question of how\\nthey compare. This paper addresses this question, considering two type systems\\nnot covered in prior work: Kokke et al.'s HCP, a type system based on a linear\\nlogic with hypersequents, and Padovani's priority-based type system for\\nasynchronous processes, dubbed P. Their distinctive features make formal\\ncomparisons relevant and challenging. Our findings are two-fold: (1) the\\nhypersequent setting does not drastically change the class of deadlock-free\\nprocesses induced by linear logic, and (2) we precisely relate the classes of\\ndeadlock-free processes induced by HCP and P. We also prove that our results\\nhold in an asynchronous setting. Our results provide new insights into the\\nessential mechanisms involved in statically avoiding deadlocks in concurrency.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.PL\", \"categories\": \"cs.PL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T12:42:37Z\"}"}
