{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01431v1\", \"title\": \"Multi-convex Programming for Discrete Latent Factor Models Prototyping\", \"summary\": \"Discrete latent factor models (DLFMs) are widely used in various domains such\\nas machine learning, economics, neuroscience, psychology, etc. Currently,\\nfitting a DLFM to some dataset relies on a customized solver for individual\\nmodels, which requires lots of effort to implement and is limited to the\\ntargeted specific instance of DLFMs. In this paper, we propose a generic\\nframework based on CVXPY, which allows users to specify and solve the fitting\\nproblem of a wide range of DLFMs, including both regression and classification\\nmodels, within a very short script. Our framework is flexible and inherently\\nsupports the integration of regularization terms and constraints on the DLFM\\nparameters and latent factors, such that the users can easily prototype the\\nDLFM structure according to their dataset and application scenario. We\\nintroduce our open-source Python implementation and illustrate the framework in\\nseveral examples.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.CE,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T07:33:54Z\"}"}
