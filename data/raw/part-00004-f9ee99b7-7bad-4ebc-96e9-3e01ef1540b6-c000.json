However, their application and usage has not grown. They can\\neven be labeled as failures, if compared to the very successful and common\\nrecommender systems (RSs) used on all the major ecommerce and social platforms.\\nAs a result, the RSs that we all use now, are only targeted for individual\\nusers, aiming at choosing an item exclusively for themselves; no choice support\\nis provided to groups trying to select a service, a product, an experience, a\\nperson, serving equally well all the group members. In this opinion article we\\ndiscuss why the success of group recommender systems is lagging and we propose\\na research program unfolding on the analysis and development of new forms of\\ncollaboration between humans and intelligent systems. We define a set of roles,\\nnamed CAJO, that GRSs should play in order to become more useful tools for\\ngroup decision making.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T11:47:40Z\"}"}
