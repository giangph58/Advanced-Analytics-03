{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21585v1\", \"title\": \"Multi-Goal Dexterous Hand Manipulation using Probabilistic Model-based\\n  Reinforcement Learning\", \"summary\": \"This paper tackles the challenge of learning multi-goal dexterous hand\\nmanipulation tasks using model-based Reinforcement Learning. We propose\\nGoal-Conditioned Probabilistic Model Predictive Control (GC-PMPC) by designing\\nprobabilistic neural network ensembles to describe the high-dimensional\\ndexterous hand dynamics and introducing an asynchronous MPC policy to meet the\\ncontrol frequency requirements in real-world dexterous hand systems. Extensive\\nevaluations on four simulated Shadow Hand manipulation scenarios with randomly\\ngenerated goals demonstrate GC-PMPC's superior performance over\\nstate-of-the-art baselines. It successfully drives a cable-driven Dexterous\\nhand, DexHand 021 with 12 Active DOFs and 5 tactile sensors, to learn\\nmanipulating a cubic die to three goal poses within approximately 80 minutes of\\ninteractions, demonstrating exceptional learning efficiency and control\\nperformance on a cost-effective dexterous hand platform.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T12:44:38Z\"}"}
