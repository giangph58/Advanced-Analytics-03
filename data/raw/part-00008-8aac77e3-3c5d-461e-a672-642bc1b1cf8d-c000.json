{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07602v1\", \"title\": \"Parameter extraction of the stochastic gravitational wave background\\n  with peak-like templates in millihertz\", \"summary\": \"We investigate a framework for extracting parameters of stochastic\\ngravitational wave background (SGWB) with peak-like templates in the millihertz\\nfrequency band, and analyzing transient contamination effects on parameter\\nreconstruction. We present the spectrum and spectrogram under different\\nconditions and provide the results of parameter reconstruction. Using templates\\nfrom the early universe, we demonstrate that the peak-like templates outperform\\nthe broken power law (BPL) templates in power-law exponents recovery and peak\\nfrequency localization. The reconstruction results obtained using data from\\nFast Fourier Transform (FFT) are better than those obtained using data from\\nShort-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) which is based on the spectrogram. For the\\nsingle-peak template, the estimation accuracy of the exponent and peak\\nfrequency surpasses that of the BPL template by an order of magnitude, but\\ndemonstrates less precision in amplitude estimation compared to BPL. Regarding\\nthe double-peak template, parameter estimation results derived from the FFT\\nmethodology consistently outperform those obtained using STFT. Nevertheless,\\ntransient signals exhibit a detrimental impact on parameter estimation\\nprecision, causing errors to increase by an order of magnitude, particularly in\\nmulti-peak scenarios. This framework provides an example for using templates to\\nanalyze data from space-based gravitational wave detectors.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T09:54:38Z\"}"}
