Our results suggest\\nthat, in practice, the collective measurement strategy is at least as good as\\nthe best local approach, and it achieves a higher average fidelity when\\naccounting for systematic errors. This photonic implementation uses a recently\\ndeveloped universal two-photon projective measurement based on Hong-Ou-Mandel\\ninterference, polarization-dependent loss, and unitary operations. We compare\\nthe performance to the case where the entangling component of the measurement\\nis suppressed. We further apply the collective measurement to quantum state\\ntomography, observing a near-optimal scaling of the infidelity with the total\\nnumber of samples.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T17:53:25Z\"}"}
