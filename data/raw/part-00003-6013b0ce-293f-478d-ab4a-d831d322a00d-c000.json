{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00500v1\", \"title\": \"Implicit Neural-Representation Learning for Elastic Deformable-Object\\n  Manipulations\", \"summary\": \"We aim to solve the problem of manipulating deformable objects, particularly\\nelastic bands, in real-world scenarios. However, deformable object manipulation\\n(DOM) requires a policy that works on a large state space due to the unlimited\\ndegree of freedom (DoF) of deformable objects. Further, their dense but partial\\nobservations (e.g., images or point clouds) may increase the sampling\\ncomplexity and uncertainty in policy learning. To figure it out, we propose a\\nnovel implicit neural-representation (INR) learning for elastic DOMs, called\\nINR-DOM. Our method learns consistent state representations associated with\\npartially observable elastic objects reconstructing a complete and implicit\\nsurface represented as a signed distance function. Furthermore, we perform\\nexploratory representation fine-tuning through reinforcement learning (RL) that\\nenables RL algorithms to effectively learn exploitable representations while\\nefficiently obtaining a DOM policy. We perform quantitative and qualitative\\nanalyses building three simulated environments and real-world manipulation\\nstudies with a Franka Emika Panda arm.
