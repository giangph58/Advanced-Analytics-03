A classical\\nknot mosaic is formed on a square grid. In this work, we identify opposite\\nedges of the square to form mosaics on the surface of a torus. We provide two\\nalgorithms for efficiently constructing toric mosaics of torus knots, providing\\nupper bounds for the toric mosaic number. Using these results and a computer\\nsearch, we provide a census of known toric mosaic numbers.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GT\", \"categories\": \"math.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T04:24:21Z\"}"}
