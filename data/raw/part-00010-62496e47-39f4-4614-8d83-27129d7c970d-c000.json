Current cryogenic readout and\\ncontrol typically requires microwave pulses of specific frequencies to travel\\nbetween the room temperature control electronics and the cryogenic setup.\\nLatency in control and readout can be improved by generating pulses within the\\ndilution refrigerator. In this work, we consider a protocol for generating\\ngigahertz frequency microwave tones from trains of DC-centered fluxons and\\nfluxoids in Josephson transmission lines using the dynamics of breather\\nformation, without room temperature synthesis or shunt / bias resistors.\\nSimulations show that pulses with frequencies in the range of 15.2 to 21.5 GHz\\ncan be generated with maximal energy efficiency of 97% and bandwidth from 40 to\\n365 MHz. This protocol can also be used to generate gigahertz frequency\\nGaussian pulses. We detail metrics relevant to the control and readout of\\nquantum systems such as input power, output power, and footprint.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T16:52:50Z\"}"}
