A key obstacle is that neural networks often fail to learn\\nrobust principles for identifying universal patterns and deriving optimal\\nsolutions from diverse instances. In this paper, we first uncover Purity Law\\n(PuLa), a fundamental structural principle for optimal TSP solutions, defining\\nthat edge prevalence grows exponentially with the sparsity of surrounding\\nvertices. Statistically validated across diverse instances, PuLa reveals a\\nconsistent bias toward local sparsity in global optima. Building on this\\ninsight, we propose Purity Policy Optimization~(PUPO), a novel training\\nparadigm that explicitly aligns characteristics of neural solutions with PuLa\\nduring the solution construction process to enhance generalization. Extensive\\nexperiments demonstrate that PUPO can be seamlessly integrated with popular\\nneural solvers, significantly enhancing their generalization performance\\nwithout incurring additional computational overhead during inference.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T16:46:48Z\"}"}
