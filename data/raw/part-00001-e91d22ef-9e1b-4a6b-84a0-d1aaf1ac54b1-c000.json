Past research in this field focuses on compiled\\nlanguage ecosystems, mostly analysing Linux distribution packages. However, the\\npopular scripting language ecosystems potentially face unique issues given the\\nsystematic difference in distributed artifacts. This SoK provides an overview\\nof existing research, aiming to highlight future directions, as well as chances\\nto transfer existing knowledge from compiled language ecosystems. To that end,\\nwe work out key aspects in current research, systematize identified challenges\\nfor software reproducibility, and map them between the ecosystems. We find that\\nthe literature is sparse, focusing on few individual problems and ecosystems.\\nThis allows us to effectively identify next steps to improve reproducibility in\\nthis field.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE,cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:10:38Z\"}"}
