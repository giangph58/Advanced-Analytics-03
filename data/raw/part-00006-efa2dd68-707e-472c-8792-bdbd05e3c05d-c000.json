{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16390v1\", \"title\": \"Probing Bulk Band Topology from Time Boundary Effect in Synthetic\\n  Dimension\", \"summary\": \"An incident wave at a temporal interface, created by an abrupt change in\\nsystem parameters, generates time-refracted and time-reflected waves. We find\\ntopological characteristics associated with the temporal interface that\\nseparates distinct spatial topologies and report a novel bulk-boundary\\ncorrespondence for the temporal interface. The vanishing of either time\\nrefraction or time reflection records a topological phase transition across the\\ntemporal interface, and the difference of bulk band topology predicts\\nnontrivial braiding hidden in the time refraction and time reflection\\ncoefficients. These findings, which are insensitive to spatial boundary\\nconditions and robust against disorder, are demonstrated in a synthetic\\nfrequency lattice with rich topological phases engendered by long-range\\ncouplings. Our work reveals the topological aspect of temporal interface and\\npaves the way for using the time boundary effect to probe topological phase\\ntransitions and topological invariants.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T03:35:12Z\"}"}
