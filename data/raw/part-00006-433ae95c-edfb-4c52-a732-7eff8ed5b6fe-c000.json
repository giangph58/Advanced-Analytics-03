{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01688v1\", \"title\": \"Enhancing European Cooperation in the Search for Dark Matter\", \"summary\": \"The search for dark matter is an exciting topic that is pursued in different\\ncommunities over a wide range of masses and using a variety of experimental\\napproaches. The result is a strongly correlated matrix of activities across\\nEurope and beyond, both on the experimental and the theoretical side. We\\nsuggest to encourage and foster the collaboration of the involved institutions\\non technical, scientific and organisational level, in order to realise the\\nsynergies that are required to increase the impact of dark matter research and\\nto cope with the increasing experiment sizes. The suggested network -- loosely\\ntitled \\\"DMInfraNet\\\" -- could be realised as a new initiative of the European\\nstrategy or be based on existing structures like iDMEu or DRD. The network can\\nalso serve as a nucleus for future joint funding proposals.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:36:28Z\"}"}
