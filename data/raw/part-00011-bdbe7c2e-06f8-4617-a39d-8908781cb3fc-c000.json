{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10335v1\", \"title\": \"MorphTok: Morphologically Grounded Tokenization for Indian Languages\", \"summary\": \"Tokenization is a crucial step in NLP, especially with the rise of large\\nlanguage models (LLMs), impacting downstream performance, computational cost,\\nand efficiency. Existing LLMs rely on the classical Byte-pair Encoding (BPE)\\nalgorithm for subword tokenization that greedily merges frequent character\\nbigrams. This often leads to segmentation that does not align with\\nlinguistically meaningful units. To address this, we propose morphology-aware\\nsegmentation as a pre-tokenization step prior to applying BPE. To facilitate\\nmorphology-aware segmentation, we create a novel dataset for Hindi and Marathi,\\nincorporating sandhi splitting to enhance the subword tokenization. Experiments\\non downstream tasks show that morphologically grounded tokenization improves\\nperformance for machine translation and language modeling. Additionally, to\\nhandle the ambiguity in the Unicode characters for diacritics, particularly\\ndependent vowels in syllable-based writing systems, we introduce Constrained\\nBPE (CBPE), an extension to the traditional BPE algorithm that incorporates\\nscript-specific constraints. Specifically, CBPE handles dependent vowels. Our\\nresults show that CBPE achieves a 1.68\\\\% reduction in fertility scores while\\nmaintaining comparable or improved downstream performance in machine\\ntranslation, offering a computationally efficient alternative to standard BPE.\\nMoreover, to evaluate segmentation across different tokenization algorithms, we\\nintroduce a new human evaluation metric, \\\\textit{EvalTok}, enabling more\\nhuman-grounded assessment.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T15:44:45Z\"}"}
