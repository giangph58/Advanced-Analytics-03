{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23970v1\", \"title\": \"A predator-prey model with Allee effect for a type of predator\", \"summary\": \"This paper investigates the dynamical behaviors of a Holling type I\\nLeslie-Gower predator-prey model where the predator exhibits an Allee effect\\nand is subjected to constant harvesting. The model demonstrates three types of\\nequilibrium points under different parameter conditions, which could be either\\nstable or unstable nodes (foci), saddle nodes, weak centers, or cusps. The\\nsystem exhibits a saddle-node bifurcation near the saddle-node point and a Hopf\\nbifurcation near the weak center. By calculating the first Lyapunov\\ncoefficient, the conditions for the occurrence of both supercritical and\\nsubcritical Hopf bifurcations are derived. Finally, it is proven that when the\\npredator growth rate and the prey capture coefficient vary within a specific\\nsmall neighborhood, the system undergoes a codimension-2 Bogdanov-Takens\\nbifurcation near the cusp point.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T11:34:48Z\"}"}
