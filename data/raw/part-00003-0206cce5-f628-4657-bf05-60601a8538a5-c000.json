{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16075v1\", \"title\": \"Explainable Unsupervised Anomaly Detection with Random Forest\", \"summary\": \"We describe the use of an unsupervised Random Forest for similarity learning\\nand improved unsupervised anomaly detection. By training a Random Forest to\\ndiscriminate between real data and synthetic data sampled from a uniform\\ndistribution over the real data bounds, a distance measure is obtained that\\nanisometrically transforms the data, expanding distances at the boundary of the\\ndata manifold. We show that using distances recovered from this transformation\\nimproves the accuracy of unsupervised anomaly detection, compared to other\\ncommonly used detectors, demonstrated over a large number of benchmark\\ndatasets. As well as improved performance, this method has advantages over\\nother unsupervised anomaly detection methods, including minimal requirements\\nfor data preprocessing, native handling of missing data, and potential for\\nvisualizations. By relating outlier scores to partitions of the Random Forest,\\nwe develop a method for locally explainable anomaly predictions in terms of\\nfeature importance.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ML\", \"categories\": \"stat.ML,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T17:54:44Z\"}"}
