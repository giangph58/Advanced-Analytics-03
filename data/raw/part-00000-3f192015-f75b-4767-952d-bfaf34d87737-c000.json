While most existing works on underwater\\nscene representation focus on a static homogeneous illumination, limited\\nattention has been paid to scenarios such as when a robot explores water deeper\\nthan a few tens of meters, where sunlight becomes insufficient. To address\\nthis, we propose a novel illumination field locally attached to the camera,\\nenabling the capture of uneven lighting effects within the viewing frustum. We\\ncombine this with a volumetric medium representation to an overall method that\\neffectively handles interaction between dynamic illumination field and static\\nscattering medium. Evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness and\\nflexibility of our approach.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:28:04Z\"}"}
