Notably, our study identifies the critical role of\\ndispersive interaction strength and environmental temperature, showing that\\nmagnon blockade remains observable under experimentally achievable cryogenic\\nconditions.This work extends the magnon blockade effect into the dispersive\\nregime, offering a robust platform for single-magnon manipulation and advancing\\napplications in quantum sensing and information processing.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T03:28:50Z\"}"}
