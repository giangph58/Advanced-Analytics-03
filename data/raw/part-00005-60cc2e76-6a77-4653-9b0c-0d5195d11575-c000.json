{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07911v1\", \"title\": \"The Urban Impact of AI: Modeling Feedback Loops in Next-Venue\\n  Recommendation\", \"summary\": \"Next-venue recommender systems are increasingly embedded in location-based\\nservices, shaping individual mobility decisions in urban environments. While\\ntheir predictive accuracy has been extensively studied, less attention has been\\npaid to their systemic impact on urban dynamics. In this work, we introduce a\\nsimulation framework to model the human-AI feedback loop underpinning\\nnext-venue recommendation, capturing how algorithmic suggestions influence\\nindividual behavior, which in turn reshapes the data used to retrain the\\nmodels. Our simulations, grounded in real-world mobility data, systematically\\nexplore the effects of algorithmic adoption across a range of recommendation\\nstrategies. We find that while recommender systems consistently increase\\nindividual-level diversity in visited venues, they may simultaneously amplify\\ncollective inequality by concentrating visits on a limited subset of popular\\nplaces. This divergence extends to the structure of social co-location\\nnetworks, revealing broader implications for urban accessibility and spatial\\nsegregation. Our framework operationalizes the feedback loop in next-venue\\nrecommendation and offers a novel lens through which to assess the societal\\nimpact of AI-assisted mobility-providing a computational tool to anticipate\\nfuture risks, evaluate regulatory interventions, and inform the design of ethic\\nalgorithmic systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:15:50Z\"}"}
