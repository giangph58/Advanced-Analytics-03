Still, it has not always been clear what is their relation with the posted\\ntext or even if there is any at all. In this work, we explore how multilingual\\nvision-language models tackle the task of image-text relation prediction in\\ndifferent languages, and construct a dedicated balanced benchmark data set from\\nTwitter posts in Latvian along with their manual translations into English. We\\ncompare our results to previous work and show that the more recently released\\nvision-language model checkpoints are becoming increasingly capable at this\\ntask, but there is still much room for further improvement.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T08:23:20Z\"}"}
