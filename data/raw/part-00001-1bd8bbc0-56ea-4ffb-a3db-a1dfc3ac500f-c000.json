Analogously, we\\npropose a frequency super-resolution method, which beats conventional spectral\\nresolution limit often approximated by full width half maximum of the spectral\\npeak, {\\\\Gamma}. This method utilizes recently developed quantum environment\\nengineering technique. With numerical simulations and experiments, we\\ndemonstrate the frequency super-resolution method in a three-nuclear-spin\\nsystem (Trifluoroiodoethylene), by successfully decomposing a thermal state\\nspectrum of the spin F3 into four peaks of engineered pseudo-pure states of the\\nquantum environment. The ultimate frequency resolution reaches {\\\\sim} 0.005\\n{\\\\Gamma}. This method is potentially useful in spectral decomposition of weakly\\ncoupled nuclear spin systems and might be improved further to acquire finer\\nfrequency super-resolution by employing more advanced quantum techniques..\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T03:05:26Z\"}"}
