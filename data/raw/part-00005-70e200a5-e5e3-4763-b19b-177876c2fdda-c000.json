{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19969v1\", \"title\": \"Holographic Consequences of Heterotic String Theory beyond its\\n  Supergravity Approximation\", \"summary\": \"In this work, we study the effects of stringy corrections on the low energy\\neffective action derived from heterotic string theory beyond its supergravity\\napproximation. Compactifying the ten dimensional theory with these stringy\\ncorrections produces an effective action for a scalar field whose higher\\nderivative term is governed by a single coefficient that depends on the\\ninternal volume, average curvature, and flux of the compactification manifold.\\nThe higher derivative coupling imported from compactification shifts the\\nBreitenlohner Freedman stability bound by an amount set by the relative\\nstrengths of internal flux and curvature, relaxing it in flux dominated vacua\\nand tightening it in curvature dominated ones. Furthermore, we analyze how the\\nstringy corrections shift the scaling dimensions of the dual operators, track\\nthe resulting renormalization group flow, and investigate the higher derivative\\nterm using a holographic Lee Wick regulator. In holographic superconductors,\\nstringy corrections lower the effective bulk mass and raise the critical\\ntemperature when flux dominates, but have the opposite effect when curvature\\ndominates.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:40:25Z\"}"}
