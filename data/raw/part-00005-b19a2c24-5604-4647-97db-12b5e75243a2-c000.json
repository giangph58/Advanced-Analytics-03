The two particles are\\ninitially prepared in a maximally entangled state and evolve independently.\\nUsing numerically exact calculations of position probability densities, average\\ninterparticle distance, entanglement entropy, and concurrence, we examine how\\ndissipation and particle-exchange symmetry of the state (symmetric or\\nantisymmetric) influence the resulting correlations. Notably, we find that the\\nentanglement entropy of the antisymmetric state decays slower than that of the\\nsymmetric state at the exceptional point of the model. We also show that, in\\nthe antisymmetric state, the concurrence measured on the one-particle reduced\\ndensity operator is unaffected by dissipation. Furthermore, we discuss how\\nthese correlations indicate quantum-to-classical transitions through the\\nappearance of Gaussian position probability densities, sub-linear growth of\\naverage interparticle distance after a few steps, and decay of the entanglement\\nentropy. On the other hand, the robustness of the qubit entanglement entropy\\ncan differentiate the model's topological phases better than in the\\none-particle quantum walk scenario.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T06:20:43Z\"}"}
