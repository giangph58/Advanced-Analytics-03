For a group of `n' heterogeneous pursuers,\\nthe proposed guidance law establishes the necessary conditions on static graphs\\nthat ensure simultaneous target interception, regardless of the initial\\nconditions of the pursuers. Building on these results, we also establish the\\nnecessary conditions for achieving simultaneous interception in switching graph\\ntopologies as well. The major highlight of the work is that the target\\ninterception occurs in finite time for both static and switching graph\\ntopologies. We demonstrate all of these results through numerical simulations.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T11:36:51Z\"}"}
