This research addresses these issues by proposing a hybrid AI\\nframework that integrates supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and\\nParticle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for intelligent task offloading and resource\\nallocation. The framework leverages supervised models for predicting optimal\\noffloading strategies, reinforcement learning for adaptive decision-making, and\\nPSO for optimizing latency and energy consumption. Extensive simulations\\ndemonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significant reductions in\\nlatency and energy usage while improving task success rates and network\\nthroughput. By offering an efficient, and scalable solution, this framework\\nsets the foundation for enhancing real-time applications in dynamic vehicular\\nenvironments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:20:02Z\"}"}
