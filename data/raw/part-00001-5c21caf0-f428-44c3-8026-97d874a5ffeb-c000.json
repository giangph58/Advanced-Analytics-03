To address\\nthis gap, we enhance the KoLLA Korean learner corpus by adding multiple\\ngrammatical error correction (GEC) references, thereby enabling more nuanced\\nand flexible evaluation of GEC systems, and reflects the variability of human\\nlanguage. Additionally, we enrich the corpus with rubric-based scores aligned\\nwith guidelines from the Korean National Language Institute, capturing\\ngrammatical accuracy, coherence, and lexical diversity. These enhancements make\\nKoLLA a robust and standardized resource for research in Korean L2 education,\\nsupporting advancements in language learning, assessment, and automated error\\ncorrection.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T03:04:07Z\"}"}
