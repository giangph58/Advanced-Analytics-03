{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19545v1\", \"title\": \"Point2Quad: Generating Quad Meshes from Point Clouds via Face Prediction\", \"summary\": \"Quad meshes are essential in geometric modeling and computational mechanics.\\nAlthough learning-based methods for triangle mesh demonstrate considerable\\nadvancements, quad mesh generation remains less explored due to the challenge\\nof ensuring coplanarity, convexity, and quad-only meshes. In this paper, we\\npresent Point2Quad, the first learning-based method for quad-only mesh\\ngeneration from point clouds. The key idea is learning to identify quad mesh\\nwith fused pointwise and facewise features. Specifically, Point2Quad begins\\nwith a k-NN-based candidate generation considering the coplanarity and\\nsquareness. Then, two encoders are followed to extract geometric and\\ntopological features that address the challenge of quad-related constraints,\\nespecially by combining in-depth quadrilaterals-specific characteristics.\\nSubsequently, the extracted features are fused to train the classifier with a\\ndesigned compound loss. The final results are derived after the refinement by a\\nquad-specific post-processing. Extensive experiments on both clear and noise\\ndata demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of Point2Quad, compared to\\nbaseline methods under comprehensive metrics.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T07:48:17Z\"}"}
