To interpret such data, we\\nupdate the public simulation code, 21cmFASTv4, to include a discrete source\\nmodel based on stochastic sampling of conditional mass functions and\\nsemi-empirical galaxy relations. We demonstrate that our new galaxy model,\\nwhich parametrizes the means and scatters of well-established scaling\\nrelations, is flexible enough to characterize very different predictions from\\nhydrodynamic cosmological simulations of high-redshift galaxies. Combining a\\ndiscrete galaxy population with approximate, efficient radiative transfer\\nallows us to self-consistently forward-model galaxy surveys, line intensity\\nmaps (LIMs), and observations of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Not only does\\neach observable probe different scales and physical processes, but\\ncross-correlation will maximise the information gained from each measurement by\\nprobing the galaxy-IGM connection at high-redshift. We find that a stochastic\\nsource field produces significant shot-noise in 21cm and LIM power spectra.\\nScatter in galaxy properties can be constrained using UV luminosity functions\\nand/or 21cm power spectra, especially if astrophysical scatter is higher than\\nexpected (as might be needed to explain recent JWST observations). Our\\nmodelling pipeline is both flexible and computationally efficient, facilitating\\nhigh-dimensional, multi-tracer, field-level Bayesian inference of cosmology and\\nastrophysics during the first billion years.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T05:18:08Z\"}"}
