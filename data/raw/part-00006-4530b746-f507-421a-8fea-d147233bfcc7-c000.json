However, standard BSMs based on linear optics (LO-BSMs) require\\nidentical photons and are susceptible to errors from multiphoton emissions,\\nleading to reduced fidelity of protocols, particularly in the absence of\\npostselection. To overcome these challenges, Bell state measurements based on\\nnonlinear optics (NLO-BSMs) have been proposed and implemented, leveraging\\nsum-frequency generation (SFG) to filter out multiphoton emissions and improve\\nthe fidelity without postselection. Here we analyze the fidelity of LO-BSM and\\nNLO-BSM heralded entanglement swapping in lossy channels and compare their\\nperformance under realistic conditions. We also explore the impact of\\nstate-of-the-art nonlinear photonics platforms on SFG efficiency and highlight\\nhow advances in nanophotonics will enable practical, high-fidelity\\nNLO-BSM-based quantum networking applications.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T17:43:45Z\"}"}
