{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01557v1\", \"title\": \"FastER: Fast On-Demand Entity Resolution in Property Graphs\", \"summary\": \"Entity resolution (ER) is the problem of identifying and linking database\\nrecords that refer to the same real-world entity. Traditional ER methods use\\nbatch processing, which becomes impractical with growing data volumes due to\\nhigh computational costs and lack of real-time capabilities. In many\\napplications, users need to resolve entities for only a small portion of their\\ndata, making full data processing unnecessary -- a scenario known as\\n\\\"ER-on-demand\\\". This paper proposes FastER, an efficient ER-on-demand framework\\nfor property graphs. Our approach uses graph differential dependencies (GDDs)\\nas a knowledge encoding language to design effective filtering mechanisms that\\nleverage both structural and attribute semantics of graphs. We construct a\\nblocking graph from filtered subgraphs to reduce the number of candidate entity\\npairs requiring comparison. Additionally, FastER incorporates Progressive\\nProfile Scheduling (PPS), allowing the system to incrementally produce results\\nthroughout the resolution process. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmark\\ndatasets demonstrate that FastER significantly outperforms state-of-the-art ER\\nmethods in computational efficiency and real-time processing for on-demand\\ntasks while ensuring reliability.
