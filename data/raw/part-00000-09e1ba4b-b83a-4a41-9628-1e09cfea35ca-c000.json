We show that the non-reality of the\\nclassical Zernike Hamiltonian is an insignificant artifact of imaginary gauge\\nand can be eliminated with a canonical transformation. The quantum counterpart\\nof this canonical transformation is a similarity transformation mapping the\\nsystem to the quantum Higgs oscillator with integration measure depending on\\n$\\\\alpha,\\\\beta$ parameters. When $\\\\alpha=2 \\\\beta$ it results in the Hermitian\\nHamiltonian describing a free particle on (pseudo)sphere, while deviation from\\nthis point leads to a pseudo-Hermitian system.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,math-ph,math.MP,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T08:55:07Z\"}"}
