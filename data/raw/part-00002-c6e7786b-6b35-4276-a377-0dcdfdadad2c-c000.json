{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11079v1\", \"title\": \"Scalability and Maintainability Challenges and Solutions in Machine\\n  Learning: Systematic Literature Review\", \"summary\": \"This systematic literature review examines the critical challenges and\\nsolutions related to scalability and maintainability in Machine Learning (ML)\\nsystems. As ML applications become increasingly complex and widespread across\\nindustries, the need to balance system scalability with long-term\\nmaintainability has emerged as a significant concern. This review synthesizes\\ncurrent research and practices addressing these dual challenges across the\\nentire ML life-cycle, from data engineering to model deployment in production.\\nWe analyzed 124 papers to identify and categorize 41 maintainability challenges\\nand 13 scalability challenges, along with their corresponding solutions. Our\\nfindings reveal intricate inter dependencies between scalability and\\nmaintainability, where improvements in one often impact the other.\\n  The review is structured around six primary research questions, examining\\nmaintainability and scalability challenges in data engineering, model\\nengineering, and ML system development. We explore how these challenges\\nmanifest differently across various stages of the ML life-cycle.\\n  This comprehensive overview offers valuable insights for both researchers and\\npractitioners in the field of ML systems. It aims to guide future research\\ndirections, inform best practices, and contribute to the development of more\\nrobust, efficient, and sustainable ML applications across various domains.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T11:24:43Z\"}"}
