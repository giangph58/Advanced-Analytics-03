As a source of\\nenergetic electrons, the shock drift acceleration mechanism at a\\nquasi-perpendicular shock is proposed. Electrons reflected and accelerated by\\nthe shock propagate through the relatively dense stellar wind plasma and excite\\nplasma waves; therefore, a plasma emission mechanism is considered as the\\nsource of the resulting radio waves. Using the bow shock of the hot Jupiter HD\\n189733b as a case study, the properties of the energetic electron beam, the\\nexcited plasma waves, and the resulting radio frequencies are estimated. An\\nenergy-based analysis is carried out to identify the range of stellar wind\\nparameters for which radio emission from the bow shock of the exoplanet HD\\n189733b could be detectable by modern astronomical instruments.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T10:59:58Z\"}"}
