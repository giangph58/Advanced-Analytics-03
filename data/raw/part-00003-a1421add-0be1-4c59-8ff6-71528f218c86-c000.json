The current experimental data for\\ntheir decay rates and angular observables show tensions with the theoretical\\npredictions that may be indications of New Physics. We present a strategy to\\nextract the relevant short-distance coefficients in the presence of new sources\\nof CP violation, utilizing a synergy with $B\\\\to K\\\\mu^+\\\\mu^-$ decays. Using the\\ncurrent data as a guideline, we illustrate the new method to determine the\\ncomplex coefficients $C_9^{(\\\\prime)}$ and $C_{10}^{(\\\\prime)}$ using only four\\nangular observables. Interestingly, the current experimental picture leaves\\nsignificant room for CP-violating New Physics. We discuss also the link to\\nleptonic $B^0_s\\\\to\\\\mu^+\\\\mu^-$ decays. We are looking forward to the\\nimplementation of these strategies at the future high-precision frontier of\\nflavour physics.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T16:26:17Z\"}"}
