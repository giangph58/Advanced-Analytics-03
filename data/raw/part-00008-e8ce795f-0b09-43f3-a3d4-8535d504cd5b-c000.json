We verify\\nthat the energy of the total system is decreasing with time. By adding two\\nstabilization terms, we have constructed a first-order temporal accuracy\\nnumerical scheme, which is linear and energy stable. Then we prove that the\\nscheme is of first-order in time by the error estimates. At last we carry out\\nenough numerical results to validate the the temporal convergence and the\\nenergy stability of such scheme. Moreover, we have present the differences of\\nthe numerical results with and without the hyperbolic terms, which show that\\nthe hyperbolic terms can help the total energy decreasing slowly.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T14:16:42Z\"}"}
