{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17277v1\", \"title\": \"ExOSITO: Explainable Off-Policy Learning with Side Information for\\n  Intensive Care Unit Blood Test Orders\", \"summary\": \"Ordering a minimal subset of lab tests for patients in the intensive care\\nunit (ICU) can be challenging. Care teams must balance between ensuring the\\navailability of the right information and reducing the clinical burden and\\ncosts associated with each lab test order. Most in-patient settings experience\\nfrequent over-ordering of lab tests, but are now aiming to reduce this burden\\non both hospital resources and the environment. This paper develops a novel\\nmethod that combines off-policy learning with privileged information to\\nidentify the optimal set of ICU lab tests to order. Our approach, EXplainable\\nOff-policy learning with Side Information for ICU blood Test Orders (ExOSITO)\\ncreates an interpretable assistive tool for clinicians to order lab tests by\\nconsidering both the observed and predicted future status of each patient. We\\npose this problem as a causal bandit trained using offline data and a reward\\nfunction derived from clinically-approved rules; we introduce a novel learning\\nframework that integrates clinical knowledge with observational data to bridge\\nthe gap between the optimal and logging policies. The learned policy function\\nprovides interpretable clinical information and reduces costs without omitting\\nany vital lab orders, outperforming both a physician's policy and prior\\napproaches to this practical problem.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T06:07:14Z\"}"}
