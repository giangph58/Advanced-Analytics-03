{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20654v1\", \"title\": \"Quantum-Assisted Tomographic Image Refinement with Limited Qubits for\\n  High-Resolution Imaging\", \"summary\": \"We propose a quantum-assisted reconstruction framework for high-resolution\\ntomographic imaging that significantly reduces both qubit requirements and\\nradiation exposure. Conventional quantum reconstruction methods require solving\\nQUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) problems over\\nfull-resolution image grids, which limits scalability under current hardware\\nconstraints. Our method addresses this by combining sinogram downscaling with\\nregion-wise iterative refinement, allowing reconstruction to begin from a\\nreduced-resolution sinogram and image, then progressively upscaled and\\noptimized region by region. Experimental validation on binary and\\ninteger-valued Shepp-Logan phantoms demonstrates accurate reconstructions under\\nboth dense and sparsely sampled projection conditions using significantly fewer\\nqubits. We observed that nearest-neighbor interpolation may cause edge\\nartifacts that hinder convergence, which can be mitigated by smoother\\ninterpolation and Gaussian filtering. Notably, reconstructing a 500 by 500\\nimage from a 50 by 50 initialization demonstrates the potential for up to 90%\\nreduction in projection data, corresponding to a similar reduction in radiation\\ndose. These findings highlight the practicality and scalability of the proposed\\nmethod for quantum-enhanced tomographic reconstruction, offering a promising\\ndirection for low-dose, high-fidelity imaging with current-generation quantum\\ndevices.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T11:25:59Z\"}"}
