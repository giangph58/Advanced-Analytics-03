However,\\nimplementing separate stabilization systems for each laser increases the\\ncomplexity and size of the setup, limiting its use to laboratory conditions. An\\nalternative approach is the use of a femtosecond optical frequency comb, which\\ntransfers the noise characteristics of a single stabilized frequency reference\\nto other wavelengths in the optical and microwave ranges. In this work, we\\ndemonstrate a scheme for transferring frequency stability from an ultrastable\\nlaser at 871 nm to a laser at 1550 nm. Measurements using the three-cornered\\nhat method show that the stabilized laser exhibits a fractional frequency\\ninstability of less than 4e-15 for averaging times between 0.4 and 2 s, and\\nbelow 1e-14 for intervals ranging from 0.2 to 500 s. The femtosecond optical\\nfrequency comb and the cavity-stabilized laser were designed to meet\\ncompactness and portability requirements to enable field and onboard\\napplications.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T11:52:40Z\"}"}
