A graph is\\nIC-planar if it can be drawn in the plane so that no two crossed edges have a\\ncommon endpoint, and is NIC-planar graphs if it can be embedded in the plane in\\nsuch a way that no two pairs of crossed edges share two endpoints. Zhang proved\\nthat every IC-planar graph with maximum degree $\\\\Delta\\\\geq 12$ and every\\nNIC-planar graph with maximum degree $\\\\Delta\\\\geq 13$ have equitable\\n$\\\\Delta$-colorings. In this paper, we reduce the threshold from 12 to 10 for\\nIC-planar graphs and from 13 to 11 for NIC-planar graphs.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T05:18:23Z\"}"}
