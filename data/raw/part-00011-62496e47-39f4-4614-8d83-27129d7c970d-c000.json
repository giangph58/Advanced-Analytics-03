We study the\\nasymptotic behaviors of ground state energies for the Dirichlet Laplacian, the\\nNeumann Laplacian, and the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator, as the field strength\\nparameter $\\\\beta$ goes to infinite. Assume that the magnetic field does not\\nvanish to infinite order, we establish the leading orders of $\\\\beta$. We also\\nobtain the first terms in the asymptotic expansions with remainder estimates\\nunder additional assumptions on an invariant subspace for a Taylor polynomial\\nof the magnetic field. Our aim is to provide a unified approach to all three\\ncases.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T16:53:41Z\"}"}
