They learn 3D Gaussians from 2D RGB images generated from\\npre-trained multi-view diffusion (MVD) models, and have shown a promising\\navenue for 3D generation through a single image. Despite the current progress,\\nthese methods still suffer from the inconsistency jointly caused by the\\ngeometric ambiguity in the 2D images, and the lack of structure of 3D\\nGaussians, leading to distorted and blurry 3D object generation. In this paper,\\nwe propose to fix these issues by GS-RGBN, a new RGBN-volume Gaussian\\nReconstruction Model designed to generate high-fidelity 3D objects from\\nsingle-view images. Our key insight is a structured 3D representation can\\nsimultaneously mitigate the afore-mentioned two issues. To this end, we propose\\na novel hybrid Voxel-Gaussian representation, where a 3D voxel representation\\ncontains explicit 3D geometric information, eliminating the geometric ambiguity\\nfrom 2D images. It also structures Gaussians during learning so that the\\noptimization tends to find better local optima. Our 3D voxel representation is\\nobtained by a fusion module that aligns RGB features and surface normal\\nfeatures, both of which can be estimated from 2D images. Extensive experiments\\ndemonstrate the superiority of our methods over prior works in terms of\\nhigh-quality reconstruction results, robust generalization, and good\\nefficiency.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:58:34Z\"}"}
