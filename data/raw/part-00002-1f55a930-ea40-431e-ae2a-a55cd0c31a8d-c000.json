An equilibrium networking formalism which\\nutilises Gaussian fields is adapted to model the dynamics of particles that can\\nbind and unbind from one another. Here, \\\\textit{networking} refers to the\\nintroduction of instantaneous co-localisation constraints and does not\\nnecessitate the formation of a well-defined transient or persistent network. By\\ncombining this formalism with Martin-Siggia-Rose generating functionals, a\\nweighted generating functional for the networked system is obtained. The\\nnetworking formalism introduces spatial and temporal constraints into the\\nLangevin dynamics, via statistical weights, thereby accounting for all possible\\nconfigurations in which particles can be networked to one another. A simple\\nexample of Brownian particles which can bind and unbind from one another\\ndemonstrates the tool and that this leads to results for physical quantities in\\na collective description. Applying the networking formalism to model the\\ndynamics of cross-linking polymers in a mixture, we can calculate the average\\nnumber of networking instances. As expected, the dynamic structure factors for\\neach type of polymer show that the system collapses once networking is\\nintroduced, but that the addition of a repulsive time-dependent potential above\\na minimum strength prevents this. The examples presented in this paper indicate\\nthat this novel approach towards modelling dynamic networking could be applied\\nto a range of synthetic and biological systems to obtain theoretical\\npredictions for experimentally verifiable quantities.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T10:25:26Z\"}"}
