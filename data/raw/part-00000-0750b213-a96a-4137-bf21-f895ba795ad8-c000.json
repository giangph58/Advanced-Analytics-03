{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20757v1\", \"title\": \"Refined Predictions for Starobinsky Inflation and Post-inflationary\\n  Constraints in Light of ACT\", \"summary\": \"Recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), combined with\\nPlanck and DESI data, suggest a higher value for the spectral index $n_s$. This\\nplaces Starobinsky inflation at the edge of the $2\\\\sigma$ constraints for a\\nnumber of e-folds $N_\\\\star$ around $60$ when using the usual analytical\\napproximations. We present refined predictions for Starobinsky inflation that\\ngo beyond the commonly used analytical approximations. By evaluating the model\\nwith these improved expressions, we show that for $N_\\\\star \\\\gtrsim 60$ it\\nremains consistent with current observational constraints at the $2\\\\sigma$\\nlevel. Additionally, we examine the implications of the ACT results for\\npost-inflationary reheating parameters. Specifically, we find a lower bound on\\nthe effective equation of state parameter during reheating of approximately\\n$\\\\omega \\\\gtrsim 0.462$; this excludes purely perturbative reheating, which\\nleads to $\\\\omega \\\\simeq 0$. We also show that the reheating temperature is\\nconstrained to be $T_{\\\\text{rh}} \\\\lesssim 2 \\\\times 10^{12}~\\\\text{GeV}$,\\nassuming $\\\\omega \\\\leq 1$. Furthermore, we find that the predictions for the\\nspectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio can lie within $1\\\\sigma$ of the\\nrecent ACT constraints if the reheating temperature satisfies $4~\\\\text{MeV}\\n\\\\lesssim T_{\\\\text{rh}} \\\\lesssim 10~\\\\text{GeV}$ for $0.8 \\\\lesssim \\\\omega \\\\leq\\n1$.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:36:14Z\"}"}
