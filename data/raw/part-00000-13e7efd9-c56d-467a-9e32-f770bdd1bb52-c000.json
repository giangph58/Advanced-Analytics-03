We use new light curves from the\\nTransiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and spectroscopic orbits from Gaia\\nDR3 to measure the physical properties of the component stars. We obtain masses\\nof 1.488 +/- 0.011 Msun and 1.482 +/- 0.011 Msun, and radii of 2.150 +/- 0.006\\nRsun and 2.271 +/- 0.006 Rsun. An orbital ephemeris from the TESS data does not\\nmatch published times of mid-eclipse from the 1970s, suggesting the period is\\nnot constant. We measure a distance to the system of 176.7 +/- 3.7 pc, which\\nagrees with the Gaia DR3 value. A comparison with theoretical models finds\\nagreement for metal abundances of Z = 0.014 and Z = 0.017 and an age of 2.3\\nGyr. No evidence for pulsations was found in the light curves. Future data from\\nTESS and Gaia will provide more precise masses and constraints on any changes\\nin orbital period.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:37:27Z\"}"}
