A fundamental limitation on clock precision is the\\nStandard Quantum Limit (SQL), which stems from the uncorrelated projection\\nnoise of each atom. State-of-the-art optical lattice clocks interrogate large\\nensembles to minimize the SQL, but density-dependent frequency shifts pose\\nchallenges to scaling the atom number. The SQL can be surpassed, however, by\\nleveraging entanglement, though it remains an open problem to achieve quantum\\nadvantage from spin squeezing at state-of-the-art stability levels. Here we\\ndemonstrate clock performance beyond the SQL, achieving a fractional frequency\\nprecision of 1.1 $\\\\times 10^{-18}$ for a single spin-squeezed clock. With\\ncavity-based quantum nondemolition (QND) measurements, we prepare two\\nspin-squeezed ensembles of $\\\\sim$30,000 strontium atoms confined in a\\ntwo-dimensional optical lattice. A synchronous clock comparison with an\\ninterrogation time of 61 ms achieves a metrological improvement of 2.0(2) dB\\nbeyond the SQL, after correcting for state preparation and measurement errors.\\nThese results establish the most precise entanglement-enhanced clock to date\\nand offer a powerful platform for exploring the interplay of gravity and\\nquantum entanglement.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T16:15:25Z\"}"}
