We discovered that\\nvarying interaction strengths and spin tunneling significantly influence the\\nproperties of correlated edge states in the energy spectrum obtained through\\nexact diagonalization. We observe that stronger interactions lead to longer\\ndecay lengths of these states. Conversely, the decay length decreases as the\\ndifference in intracell or intercell tunneling increases. Importantly, the\\ndecay length is strongly correlated with the dynamical behavior of two\\nparticles; specifically, an increase in decay length corresponds to a decrease\\nin motion frequency. This conclusion is supported by the observation of the\\nexpectation value of coordinate operators of the particles.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T07:50:06Z\"}"}
