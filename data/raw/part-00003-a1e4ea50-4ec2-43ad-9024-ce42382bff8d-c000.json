{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00672v1\", \"title\": \"On Minimal Generating Sets of Splitting Field and Cluster Towers\", \"summary\": \"The concept of cluster towers was introduced by the second author and\\nKrithika in [4] along with a question which was answered by the first author\\nand Bhagwat in [1]. In this article we introduce the concept of minimal\\ngenerating sets of splitting field and connect it to the concept of cluster\\ntowers. We establish that there exist infinitely many irreducible polynomials\\nover rationals for which the splitting field has two extreme minimal generating\\nsets (one of given cardinality and other of minimum cardinality) and for which\\nwe have two extreme cluster towers (one of given length and other of minimum\\nlength). We prove interesting properties of cluster tower associated with\\nminimal generating set that we constructed in proof of the theorem and as a\\nconsequence get that degree sequence depends on the ordering even when we work\\nwith minimal generating set. We also establish an equivalent condition for a\\nset to be minimum minimal generating set for a certain family of polynomials\\nover rationals and count the total number of minimum minimal generating sets.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT,math.AC,math.CO,math.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T17:24:51Z\"}"}
