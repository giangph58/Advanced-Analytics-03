However, these models take only one data\\ntype as input. We introduce dynamic token adaptation and demonstrate how it\\ncombines these models to predict gene regulation at the single-cell level in\\ndifferent genetic contexts. Although the method is generalisable, we focus on\\nan illustrative example by training an adapter from DNA-sequence embeddings to\\na single-cell foundation model's token embedding space. As a qualitative\\nevaluation, we assess the impact of DNA sequence changes on the model's learned\\ngene regulatory networks by mutating the transcriptional start site of the\\ntranscription factor GATA4 in silico, observing predicted expression changes in\\nits target genes in fetal cardiomyocytes.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.GN\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.GN\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T16:05:59Z\"}"}
