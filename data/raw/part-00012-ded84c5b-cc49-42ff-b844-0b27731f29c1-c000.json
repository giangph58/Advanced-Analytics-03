In this system a multicritical point is present, where the global\\nsymmetry O(2)$\\\\oplus$O(3) gets enlarged to O(5). Such a symmetry enlargement is\\nhindered for generic systems by the instability of the O(5) multicritical\\npoint, but the SU(2) gauge symmetry prevents the appearance of the term\\ntriggering the instability. All the numerical results obtained in this lattice\\ngauge model fully support the expectations coming from the O(2)$\\\\oplus$O(3)\\nmulticritical Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson $\\\\phi^4$ theory, and we discuss possible\\nimplications of these results for some models of deconfined quantum\\ncriticality.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-lat\", \"categories\": \"hep-lat,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T11:34:07Z\"}"}
