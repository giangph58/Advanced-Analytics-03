Through structured tables and\\ncomparative summaries, I map core assumptions, tasks, and analytical choices\\nfrom multiple causal frameworks, highlighting their connections and\\ndifferences. The synthesis provides practical guidance for researchers\\ndesigning causal studies, especially in settings where observational or\\nexperimental constraints challenge standard approaches. This guide spans all\\nphases of causal analysis, including question formulation, formalization of\\nbackground knowledge, selection of appropriate frameworks, choice of study\\ndesign or algorithm, and interpretation. It is intended as a tool to support\\nrigorous causal reasoning across diverse empirical domains.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,q-bio.QM,stat.AP,stat.OT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T09:58:06Z\"}"}
