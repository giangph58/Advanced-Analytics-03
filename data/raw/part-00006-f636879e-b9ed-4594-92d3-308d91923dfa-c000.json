{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20750v1\", \"title\": \"Limits of absolute vector magnetometry with NV centers in diamond\", \"summary\": \"The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has become a widely used platform\\nfor quantum sensing. The four NV axes in mono-crystalline diamond specifically\\nallow for vector magnetometry, with magnetic-field sensitivities reaching down\\nto $\\\\mathrm{fT}/ \\\\sqrt{\\\\mathrm{Hz}}$. The current literature primarily focuses\\non improving the precision of NV-based magnetometers. Here, we study the\\nexperimental accuracy of determining the magnetic field from measured\\nspin-resonance frequencies via solving the NV Hamiltonian. We derive exact,\\nanalytical, and fast-to-compute formulas for calculating resonance frequencies\\nfrom a known magnetic-field vector, and vice versa, formulas for calculating\\nthe magnetic-field vector from measured resonance frequencies. Additionally,\\nthe accuracy of often-used approximations is assessed. Finally, we promote\\nusing the Voigt profile as a fit model to determine the linewidth of measured\\nresonances accurately. An open-source Python package accompanies our analysis.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.data-an\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:32:09Z\"}"}
