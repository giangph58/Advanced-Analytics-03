{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06857v1\", \"title\": \"Machine Learning-Assisted Unfolding for Neutrino Cross-section\\n  Measurements\", \"summary\": \"The choice of unfolding method for a cross-section measurement is tightly\\ncoupled to the model dependence of the efficiency correction and the overall\\nimpact of cross-section modeling uncertainties in the analysis. A key issue is\\nthe dimensionality used in unfolding, as the kinematics of all outgoing\\nparticles in an event typically affect the reconstruction performance in a\\nneutrino detector. OmniFold is an unfolding method that iteratively reweights a\\nsimulated dataset, using machine learning to utilize arbitrarily\\nhigh-dimensional information, that has previously been applied to proton-proton\\nand proton-electron datasets. This paper demonstrates OmniFold's application to\\na neutrino cross-section measurement for the first time using a public T2K near\\ndetector simulated dataset, comparing its performance with traditional\\napproaches using a mock data study.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex,hep-ph,physics.data-an\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:08:35Z\"}"}
