{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11769v1\", \"title\": \"Sliding Block Martingale based Multi-hop Delay QoS Analysis\", \"summary\": \"With the growing density of wireless networks and demand for multi-hop\\ntransmissions, precise delay Quality of Service (QoS) analysis has become a\\ncritical challenge. This paper introduces a multi-hop delay QoS analysis\\nframework based on the sliding block martingale, addressing the loose boundary\\nissue of prior methods that rely on service process martingales and min-plus\\ntransformations. By constructing a sliding block martingale with a window, we\\ncapture both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations in the backlog,\\neliminating the reliance on the generalized incremental property. The framework\\nredefines delay unreliability events using cascading attributes, deriving a\\nmore compact Delay Unreliability Probability Boundary (DUPB). To improve the\\nefficiency of solving the key parameter $\\\\theta$, we propose a Micrometric\\nIntervals based Supermartingale Upcrossing Estimate Theorem, quantifying the\\nupper bound of event occurrence frequency to constrain the solution space of\\n$\\\\theta$. Simulations based on the 3GPP UMa/UMi channel model validate the\\nframework's effectiveness. Results show that in 2-7 hop scenarios, the maximum\\ndeviation between theoretical boundaries and Monte Carlo simulations is $4.116\\n\\\\times 10^{-5}$, with a lower RMSE than existing methods. Iteration count and\\nCPU time for solving $\\\\theta$ are reduced by $59\\\\%-72\\\\%$ and $60.6\\\\%-70.5\\\\%$,\\nrespectively, improving analysis efficiency. Furthermore, the derived minimum\\nservice rate for multi-hop queues offers a valuable reference for resource\\nallocation. The framework demonstrates high accuracy, scalability, and\\npracticality in complex multi-hop networks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T05:13:53Z\"}"}
