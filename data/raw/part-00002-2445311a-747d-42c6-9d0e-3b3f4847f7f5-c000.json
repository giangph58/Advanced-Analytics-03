Lots of studies have proposed\\nmethods and interfaces for controlling insects and obtaining feedback. However,\\nthere have been less research on the use of insects for interaction with third\\nparties. In this paper, we propose a method in which cicadas are used as\\nspeakers triggered by using Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS). We explored\\nand investigated the suitable waveform of chirp to be controlled, the\\nappropriate voltage range, and the maximum pitch at which cicadas can chirp.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.AR,cs.ET,cs.RO,cs.SD\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T07:04:37Z\"}"}
