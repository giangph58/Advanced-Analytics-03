{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16555v1\", \"title\": \"Confidence Sequences for Generalized Linear Models via Regret Analysis\", \"summary\": \"We develop a methodology for constructing confidence sets for parameters of\\nstatistical models via a reduction to sequential prediction. Our key\\nobservation is that for any generalized linear model (GLM), one can construct\\nan associated game of sequential probability assignment such that achieving low\\nregret in the game implies a high-probability upper bound on the excess\\nlikelihood of the true parameter of the GLM. This allows us to develop a scheme\\nthat we call online-to-confidence-set conversions, which effectively reduces\\nthe problem of proving the desired statistical claim to an algorithmic\\nquestion. We study two varieties of this conversion scheme: 1) analytical\\nconversions that only require proving the existence of algorithms with low\\nregret and provide confidence sets centered at the maximum-likelihood estimator\\n2) algorithmic conversions that actively leverage the output of the online\\nalgorithm to construct confidence sets (and may be centered at other,\\nadaptively constructed point estimators). The resulting methodology recovers\\nall state-of-the-art confidence set constructions within a single framework,\\nand also provides several new types of confidence sets that were previously\\nunknown in the literature.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,cs.LG,stat.ML,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T09:32:40Z\"}"}
