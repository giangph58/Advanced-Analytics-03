A hole is odd if it\\nhas an odd number of vertices. A dart is a graph which vertices $a, b, c, d, e$\\nand edges $ab, bc, bd, be, cd, de$. Dart-free graphs have been actively studied\\nin the literature. We prove that a (dart, odd hole)-free graph is perfect, or\\ndoes not contain a stable set on three vertices, or is the join or co-join of\\ntwo smaller graphs. Using this structure result, we design a polynomial-time\\nalgorithm for finding an optimal colouring of (dart, odd hole)-free graphs. A\\ngraph $G$ is perfectly divisible if every induced subgraph $H$ of $G$ contains\\na set $X$ of vertices such that $X$ meets all largest cliques of $H$, and $X$\\ninduces a perfect graph. The chromatic number of a perfectly divisible graph\\n$G$ is bounded by $\\\\omega^2$ where $\\\\omega$ denotes the number of vertices in a\\nlargest clique of $G$. We prove that (dart, odd hole)-free graphs are perfectly\\ndivisible.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,cs.DM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T04:33:46Z\"}"}
