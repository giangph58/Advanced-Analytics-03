{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05938v1\", \"title\": \"Umbral oscillations in the photosphere. A comprehensive statistical\\n  study\", \"summary\": \"It is well-known that the global acoustic oscillations of the Sun's\\natmosphere can excite resonance modes within large-scale magnetic\\nconcentrations. These structures are conduits of energy between the different\\nlayers of the solar atmosphere, and understanding their dynamics can explain\\nthe processes behind coronal heating and solar wind acceleration. In this work,\\nwe studied the Doppler velocity spectrum of more than a thousand large-scale\\nmagnetic structures (i.e., sunspots) in the solar photosphere that crossed near\\nthe disk centre of the Sun. We exploited the excellent stability and\\nseeing-free conditions of the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) instrument\\nonboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) to cover nearly seven years of\\nobservations, providing the most comprehensive statistical analysis of its\\nkind. Here, we show that the power spectra of the umbra of sunspots in the\\nphotosphere is remarkably different from the one of quiet-Sun regions, with\\nboth exhibiting a primary peak at 3.3 mHz, but the sunspot umbrae also\\ndisplaying a closely packed series of secondary peaks in the $4-6$~mHz band.\\nUnderstanding the origin of such peaks is a challenging task. Here, we explore\\nseveral possible explanations for the observed oscillations, all pointing\\ntoward a potential resonant interaction within these structures and an unknown\\ndriver. Our observational result provides further insight into the magnetic\\nconnectivity between the different layers of the dynamic atmosphere of the Sun.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T11:53:49Z\"}"}
