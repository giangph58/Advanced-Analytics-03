{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11763v1\", \"title\": \"Extended Short- and Long-Range Mesh Learning for Fast and Generalized\\n  Garment Simulation\", \"summary\": \"3D garment simulation is a critical component for producing cloth-based\\ngraphics. Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) offer a promising\\napproach for efficient garment simulation. However, GNNs require extensive\\nmessage-passing to propagate information such as physical forces and maintain\\ncontact awareness across the entire garment mesh, which becomes computationally\\ninefficient at higher resolutions. To address this, we devise a novel GNN-based\\nmesh learning framework with two key components to extend the message-passing\\nrange with minimal overhead, namely the Laplacian-Smoothed Dual Message-Passing\\n(LSDMP) and the Geodesic Self-Attention (GSA) modules. LSDMP enhances\\nmessage-passing with a Laplacian features smoothing process, which efficiently\\npropagates the impact of each vertex to nearby vertices. Concurrently, GSA\\nintroduces geodesic distance embeddings to represent the spatial relationship\\nbetween vertices and utilises attention mechanisms to capture global mesh\\ninformation. The two modules operate in parallel to ensure both short- and\\nlong-range mesh modelling. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\\nstate-of-the-art performance of our method, requiring fewer layers and lower\\ninference latency.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T04:56:01Z\"}"}
