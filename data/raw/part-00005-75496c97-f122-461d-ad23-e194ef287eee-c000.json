{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03659v1\", \"title\": \"Meta-Learning the Optimal Mixture of Strategies for Online Portfolio\\n  Selection\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents an innovative online portfolio selection model, situated\\nwithin a meta-learning framework, that leverages a mixture policies strategy.\\nThe core idea is to simulate a fund that employs multiple fund managers, each\\nskilled in handling different market environments, and dynamically allocate our\\nfunding to these fund managers for investment. To address the non-stationary\\nnature of financial markets, we divide the long-term process into multiple\\nshort-term processes to adapt to changing environments. We use a clustering\\nmethod to identify a set of historically high-performing policies,\\ncharacterized by low similarity, as candidate policies. Additionally, we employ\\na meta-learning method to search for initial parameters that can quickly adapt\\nto upcoming target investment tasks, effectively providing a set of well-suited\\ninitial strategies. Subsequently, we update the initial parameters using the\\ntarget tasks and determine the optimal mixture weights for these candidate\\npolicies. Empirical tests show that our algorithm excels in terms of training\\ntime and data requirements, making it particularly suitable for high-frequency\\nalgorithmic trading. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct\\nnumerical tests on cross-training datasets, demonstrating its excellent\\ntransferability and robustness.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T16:05:03Z\"}"}
