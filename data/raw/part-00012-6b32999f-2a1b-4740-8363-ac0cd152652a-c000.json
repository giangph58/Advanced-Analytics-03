Although generally used for qubits, the\\nexisting superconducting transmon architecture can naturally be extended to\\nthree levels, which allows the exploration of the entire qutrit Hilbert space.\\nRealizing a maximally entangling two-qutrit gate is necessary for universal\\nquantum computation using three-level systems. Our work extends the\\nstate-of-the-art approach by providing a theoretical framework for realizing a\\nhigh-fidelity two-qutrit generalized CR gate using the cross-resonance\\nframework. Using our framework, we experimentally demonstrate two-qutrit\\ngeneralized controlled-$\\\\sqrt{X}$ gates through simulations on QISKIT dynamics,\\nwhich in turn allow us to obtain a maximum extracted concurrence of\\n$97.2\\\\pm0.1\\\\%$, thereby demonstrating that entanglement has been achieved on\\nall three levels. Using the above gates, we also prepare a two-qutrit Bell\\nstate with a fidelity of $96.9\\\\pm 0.1\\\\%$.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T17:47:16Z\"}"}
