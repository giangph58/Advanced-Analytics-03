{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10390v1\", \"title\": \"Teacher Motion Priors: Enhancing Robot Locomotion over Challenging\\n  Terrain\", \"summary\": \"Achieving robust locomotion on complex terrains remains a challenge due to\\nhigh dimensional control and environmental uncertainties. This paper introduces\\na teacher prior framework based on the teacher student paradigm, integrating\\nimitation and auxiliary task learning to improve learning efficiency and\\ngeneralization. Unlike traditional paradigms that strongly rely on\\nencoder-based state embeddings, our framework decouples the network design,\\nsimplifying the policy network and deployment. A high performance teacher\\npolicy is first trained using privileged information to acquire generalizable\\nmotion skills. The teacher's motion distribution is transferred to the student\\npolicy, which relies only on noisy proprioceptive data, via a generative\\nadversarial mechanism to mitigate performance degradation caused by\\ndistributional shifts. Additionally, auxiliary task learning enhances the\\nstudent policy's feature representation, speeding up convergence and improving\\nadaptability to varying terrains. The framework is validated on a humanoid\\nrobot, showing a great improvement in locomotion stability on dynamic terrains\\nand significant reductions in development costs. This work provides a practical\\nsolution for deploying robust locomotion strategies in humanoid robots.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:36:56Z\"}"}
