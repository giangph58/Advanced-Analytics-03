{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15706v1\", \"title\": \"Distributed Compression for Computation and Bounds on the Optimal Rate\", \"summary\": \"We address the problem of distributed computation of arbitrary functions of\\ntwo correlated sources $X_1$ and $X_2$, residing in two distributed source\\nnodes, respectively. We exploit the structure of a computation task by coding\\nsource characteristic graphs (and multiple instances using the $n$-fold OR\\nproduct of this graph with itself). For regular graphs and general graphs, we\\nestablish bounds on the optimal rate -- characterized by the chromatic entropy\\nfor the $n$-fold graph products -- that allows a receiver for asymptotically\\nlossless computation of arbitrary functions over finite fields. For the special\\nclass of cycle graphs (i.e., $2$-regular graphs), we establish an exact\\ncharacterization of chromatic numbers and derive bounds on the required rates.\\nNext, focusing on the more general class of $d$-regular graphs, we establish\\nconnections between $d$-regular graphs and expansion rates for $n$-fold graph\\npowers using graph spectra. Finally, for general graphs, we leverage the\\nGershgorin Circle Theorem (GCT) to provide a characterization of the spectra,\\nwhich allows us to build new bounds on the optimal rate. Our codes leverage the\\nspectra of the computation and provide a graph expansion-based characterization\\nto efficiently/succinctly capture the computation structure, providing new\\ninsights into the problem of distributed computation of arbitrary functions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T08:47:40Z\"}"}
