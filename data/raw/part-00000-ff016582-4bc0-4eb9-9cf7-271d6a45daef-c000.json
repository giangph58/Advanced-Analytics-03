Here,\\nwe investigate the statistical properties of observables in the eigenbasis of\\nthe Lindbladian operator of a Markovian open quantum system. We demonstrate the\\nvalidity of a Lindbladian ETH ansatz through extensive numerical simulations of\\nseveral physical models. To highlight the robustness of Lindbladian ETH, we\\nconsider what we dub the dilute-click regime of the model, in which one\\npostselects only quantum trajectories with a finite fraction of quantum jumps.\\nThe average dynamics are generated by a non-trace-preserving Liouvillian, and\\nwe show that the Lindbladian ETH ansatz still holds in this case. On the other\\nhand, the no-click limit is a singular point at which the Lindbladian reduces\\nto a doubled non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and Lindbladian ETH breaks down.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech,cond-mat.dis-nn,nlin.CD,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T14:25:11Z\"}"}
