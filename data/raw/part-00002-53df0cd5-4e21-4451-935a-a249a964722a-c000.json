{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05310v1\", \"title\": \"A comparative analysis of GNSS-inferred precipitable water vapour at the\\n  potential sites for the Africa Millimetre Telescope\", \"summary\": \"The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is a network of antennas across the globe\\ncurrently used to image super-massive black holes (SMBHs) at a frequency of 230\\nGHz. Since the release of the image of M87$^\\\\ast$ in 2019 and, subsequently,\\nthat of Sgr A$^\\\\ast$ in 2022 by the EHT collaboration, the focus has shifted to\\ndynamically imaging SMBHs. This has led to a search for potential sites to\\nextend and fill in the gaps within the EHT network. The Gamsberg Mountain and\\nthe H.E.S.S. site are both located within the Khomas highlands and have been\\nidentified as potential sites for the Africa Millimetre Telescope (AMT).\\nPrecipitable water vapour (PWV) in the atmosphere is the main source of opacity\\nand noise from atmospheric emissions when observing at millimetre to\\nsub-millimetre wavelengths. This study aims to establish the PWV content and\\nthe atmospheric transmission at 86, 230, and 345 GHz at the AMT potential sites\\nusing Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) derived PWV data. Results show\\nboth sites have potential for observations at 86 and 230 GHz, with 345 GHz\\npossible at the Gamsberg Mountain during winter. The overall median PWV of\\n14.27 mm and 9.25 mm was calculated at the H.E.S.S. site and the Gamsberg\\nMountain, respectively. The EHT window had PWV medians of 16.62 mm and 11.20 mm\\nat the H.E.S.S. site and Gamsberg Mountain, respectively. Among the two sites,\\nthe Gamsberg Mountain had the lowest PWV conditions, therefore making it the\\nmost suitable site for the AMT.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM,physics.data-an\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:59:40Z\"}"}
