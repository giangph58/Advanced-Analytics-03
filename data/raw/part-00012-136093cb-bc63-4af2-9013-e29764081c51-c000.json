{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15600v1\", \"title\": \"Research on Navigation Methods Based on LLMs\", \"summary\": \"In recent years, the field of indoor navigation has witnessed groundbreaking\\nadvancements through the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs).\\nTraditional navigation approaches relying on pre-built maps or reinforcement\\nlearning exhibit limitations such as poor generalization and limited\\nadaptability to dynamic environments. In contrast, LLMs offer a novel paradigm\\nfor complex indoor navigation tasks by leveraging their exceptional semantic\\ncomprehension, reasoning capabilities, and zero-shot generalization properties.\\nWe propose an LLM-based navigation framework that leverages function calling\\ncapabilities, positioning the LLM as the central controller. Our methodology\\ninvolves modular decomposition of conventional navigation functions into\\nreusable LLM tools with expandable configurations. This is complemented by a\\nsystematically designed, transferable system prompt template and interaction\\nworkflow that can be easily adapted across different implementations.\\nExperimental validation in PyBullet simulation environments across diverse\\nscenarios demonstrates the substantial potential and effectiveness of our\\napproach, particularly in achieving context-aware navigation through dynamic\\ntool composition.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T05:40:59Z\"}"}
