N. Hindman and D.\\nStrauss established that if $u,v \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}$, $A$ is a $u \\\\times v$ matrix\\nwith entries from $\\\\mathbb{Q}$ and $\\\\psi$ is a notion of a large set in\\n$\\\\mathbb{N}$, then $\\\\{\\\\vec{x} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}^v: A\\\\vec{x} \\\\in \\\\psi^u \\\\}$ is\\nlarge in $\\\\mathbb{N}^v$. Among the several notions of largeness, C sets\\noccupies an important place of study because they exhibit strong combinatorial\\nproperties. The analogous notion of C set appears for a dense subsemigroup $S$\\nof $((0, \\\\infty),+)$ called a C-set near zero. These sets also have very rich\\ncombinatorial structure. In this article, we investigate the above result for C\\nsets near zero in $\\\\mathbb{R}^+$ when the matrix has real entries. We also\\ndevelop a new characterisation of C-sets near zero in $\\\\mathbb{R}^+$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T10:19:57Z\"}"}
