Numerical simulations of the 2D and 1D\\nGross-Pitaevskii equations show that the difference of the topological\\ncharges(vorticities) $\\\\Delta n$ of the condensate and the quasi-resonant\\ncoherent drive plays a crucial role in the synchronization dynamics. It is\\nshown that in an axially symmetric system, synchronization can only occur if\\n$|\\\\Delta n| = 0$, whereas in the other cases the phase of the condensate cannot\\nbe locked to the phase of the coherent drive. To explain this effect observed\\nin the numerical simulations a perturbation theory is developed. The theory\\nshows that the phase slip between the condensate and the coherent drive can be\\nunderstood in terms of the motion of 2$\\\\pi$ kinks. It is shown that the\\nbreaking of the axial symmetry can stop the motion of the kinks, allowing the\\nphase locking of the condensate to the coherent drive.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:16:22Z\"}"}
