{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04461v1\", \"title\": \"A Survey on Temporal Interaction Graph Representation Learning:\\n  Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities\", \"summary\": \"Temporal interaction graphs (TIGs), defined by sequences of timestamped\\ninteraction events, have become ubiquitous in real-world applications due to\\ntheir capability to model complex dynamic system behaviors. As a result,\\ntemporal interaction graph representation learning (TIGRL) has garnered\\nsignificant attention in recent years. TIGRL aims to embed nodes in TIGs into\\nlow-dimensional representations that effectively preserve both structural and\\ntemporal information, thereby enhancing the performance of downstream tasks\\nsuch as classification, prediction, and clustering within constantly evolving\\ndata environments. In this paper, we begin by introducing the foundational\\nconcepts of TIGs and emphasize the critical role of temporal dependencies. We\\nthen propose a comprehensive taxonomy of state-of-the-art TIGRL methods,\\nsystematically categorizing them based on the types of information utilized\\nduring the learning process to address the unique challenges inherent to TIGs.\\nTo facilitate further research and practical applications, we curate the source\\nof datasets and benchmarks, providing valuable resources for empirical\\ninvestigations. Finally, we examine key open challenges and explore promising\\nresearch directions in TIGRL, laying the groundwork for future advancements\\nthat have the potential to shape the evolution of this field.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:31:10Z\"}"}
