Traditional approaches often rely\\non static snapshots of network states, which can obscure the underlying\\ndynamics of opinion evolution. In this study, we introduce a dynamic framework\\nthat quantifies the unpredictability of opinion trajectories using the\\nnormalized Lempel-Ziv (nLZ) complexity. Our approach leverages an adaptive\\nsocial network model where each node is characterized by three behavioral\\nparameters - homophily, neophily, and social conformity - and where opinions\\nevolve continuously according to a system of ordinary differential equations.\\nThe results reveal distinct nLZ complexity signatures for each node type:\\nhomophilic nodes exhibit consistently rising complexity, reflecting\\nincreasingly unpredictable opinion shifts that are counterintuitive given their\\ntendency for similarity; neophilic nodes maintain low and stable complexity,\\nsuggesting that openness to novelty can, surprisingly, lead to stable opinion\\ndynamics; and conformic nodes display a U-shaped complexity trend,\\ntransitioning from early opinion stagnation to later unpredictability. In fully\\nheterogeneous networks, modest interaction effects emerge, with slight shifts\\nin the unpredictability of each faction's trajectories. These findings\\nunderscore the importance of temporal analysis in uncovering hidden dynamical\\npatterns, offering novel insights into the mechanisms underlying social\\nadaptation and polarization.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SI\", \"categories\": \"cs.SI,physics.soc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:27:06Z\"}"}
