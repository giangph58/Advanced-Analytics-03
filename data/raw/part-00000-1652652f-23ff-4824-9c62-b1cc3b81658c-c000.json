{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13160v1\", \"title\": \"Discovery and Dynamics of the Nontransiting Planet Kepler-139f\", \"summary\": \"Among the ways that an outer giant planet can alter the architecture of an\\ninner planetary system is by tilting the orbits of the inner planets and\\nreducing their mutual transit probabilities. Here, we report on an example of\\nthis phenomenon: we show that the Kepler-139 system contains a nontransiting\\nplanet just exterior to three transiting planets, and interior to a giant\\nplanet. This newly discovered planet, Kepler-139f, has an orbital period of\\n$355 \\\\pm 2$ days and a mass of $36 \\\\pm 10 M_\\\\oplus$ based on transit-timing and\\nradial-velocity data. Through dynamical simulations, we show that gravitational\\nperturbations on planet f's orbit from the outer giant planet reduce the\\nprobability for a randomly located observer to see transits of all four inner\\nplanets. Thus, Kepler-139 illustrates the role that outer giant planets can\\nplay in the apparent truncation of compact systems of multiple transiting\\nplanets.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:57:59Z\"}"}
