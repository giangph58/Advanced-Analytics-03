To align audio embeddings between speakers, we employ discrete\\noptimal transport mapping. Our evaluation results demonstrate the high quality\\nand effectiveness of this method. Additionally, we show that applying discrete\\noptimal transport as a post-processing step in audio generation can lead to the\\nincorrect classification of synthetic audio as real.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.AS\", \"categories\": \"eess.AS,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T13:04:29Z\"}"}
