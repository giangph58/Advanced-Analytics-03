Models based\\non these mechanisms consider the lack of interactions as the main cause of\\npolarization. Given the increasing connectivity in modern society, this\\nexplanation of polarization may be insufficient. We aim to show that in\\ninvolvement-based models, society becomes more polarized as its connectedness\\nincreases. To this end, we propose a minimal voter-type model (called I-voter)\\nthat incorporates involvement as a key mechanism in opinion formation and study\\nits dependence on network connectivity. We describe the steady-state behaviour\\nof the model analytically, at the mean-field and the moment-hierarchy levels.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:52:27Z\"}"}
