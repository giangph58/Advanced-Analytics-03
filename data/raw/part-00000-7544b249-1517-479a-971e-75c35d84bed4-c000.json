{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24166v1\", \"title\": \"Foundation Models For Seismic Data Processing: An Extensive Review\", \"summary\": \"Seismic processing plays a crucial role in transforming raw data into\\nhigh-quality subsurface images, pivotal for various geoscience applications.\\nDespite its importance, traditional seismic processing techniques face\\nchallenges such as noisy and damaged data and the reliance on manual,\\ntime-consuming workflows. The emergence of deep learning approaches has\\nintroduced effective and user-friendly alternatives, yet many of these deep\\nlearning approaches rely on synthetic datasets and specialized neural networks.\\nRecently, foundation models have gained traction in the seismic domain, due to\\ntheir success in natural imaging. This paper investigates the application of\\nfoundation models in seismic processing on the tasks: demultiple,\\ninterpolation, and denoising. It evaluates the impact of different model\\ncharacteristics, such as pre-training technique and neural network\\narchitecture, on performance and efficiency. Rather than proposing a single\\nseismic foundation model, this paper critically examines various natural image\\nfoundation models and suggest some promising candidates for future exploration.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:48:31Z\"}"}
