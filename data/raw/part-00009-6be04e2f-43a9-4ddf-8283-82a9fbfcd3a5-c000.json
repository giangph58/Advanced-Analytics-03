We find the line-of-sight velocity\\ndispersions in those regions to be sigma_z=208+-12 km/s and 202+-24 km/s,\\nrespectively. The central value corresponds to a 3D Mach number of\\nM=0.24+-0.015 and the ratio of the kinetic pressure of small-scale motions to\\nthermal pressure in the intracluster plasma of only 3.1+-0.4%, at the lower end\\nof predictions from cosmological simulations for merging clusters like Coma,\\nand similar to that observed in the cool core of the relaxed cluster A2029.\\nMeanwhile, the gas in both regions exhibits high line-of-sight velocity\\ndifferences from the mean velocity of the cluster galaxies, Delta v_z=450+-15\\nkm/s and 730+-30 km/s, respectively. A small contribution from an additional\\ngas velocity component, consistent with the cluster optical mean, is detected\\nalong a sightline near the cluster center. The combination of the observed\\nvelocity dispersions and bulk velocities is not described by a Kolmogorov\\nvelocity power spectrum of steady-state turbulence; instead, the data imply a\\nmuch steeper effective slope (i.e., relatively more power at larger linear\\nscales). This may indicate either a very large dissipation scale resulting in\\nthe suppression of small-scale motions, or a transient dynamic state of the\\ncluster, where large-scale gas flows generated by an ongoing merger have not\\nyet cascaded down to small scales.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T16:47:34Z\"}"}
