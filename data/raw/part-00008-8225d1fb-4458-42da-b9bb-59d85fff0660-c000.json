The novelty is that we view the differential operator\\n$\\\\Box+\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{t}\\\\partial_t$ as $n+1+\\\\mu$ dimensional operator, then a\\nwell-matched multiplier is introduced. As an application, a sharp global\\nexistence result for the small data Cauchy problem of the semilinear wave\\nequation \\\\[ \\\\partial_t^2u-\\\\Delta u+\\\\frac{\\\\partial_tu}{t}=|u|^p,~~~t>t_0\\\\geq 0\\n\\\\] is obtained in $\\\\mathbb{R}^n (n\\\\geq 4)$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:14:43Z\"}"}
