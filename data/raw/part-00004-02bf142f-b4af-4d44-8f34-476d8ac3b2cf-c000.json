Most previous works are limited by small-scale labeled dataset, which\\nhinders the real-world application of object placement. In this work, we devise\\na semi-supervised framework which can exploit large-scale unlabeled dataset to\\npromote the generalization ability of discriminative object placement models.\\nThe discriminative models predict the rationality label for each foreground\\nplacement given a foreground-background pair. To better leverage the labeled\\ndata, under the semi-supervised framework, we further propose to transfer the\\nknowledge of rationality variation, \\\\emph{i.e.}, whether the change of\\nforeground placement would result in the change of rationality label, from\\nlabeled data to unlabeled data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\\nframework can effectively enhance the generalization ability of discriminative\\nobject placement models.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T12:39:00Z\"}"}
