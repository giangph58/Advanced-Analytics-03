{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12825v1\", \"title\": \"TwoSquared: 4D Generation from 2D Image Pairs\", \"summary\": \"Despite the astonishing progress in generative AI, 4D dynamic object\\ngeneration remains an open challenge. With limited high-quality training data\\nand heavy computing requirements, the combination of hallucinating unseen\\ngeometry together with unseen movement poses great challenges to generative\\nmodels. In this work, we propose TwoSquared as a method to obtain a 4D\\nphysically plausible sequence starting from only two 2D RGB images\\ncorresponding to the beginning and end of the action. Instead of directly\\nsolving the 4D generation problem, TwoSquared decomposes the problem into two\\nsteps: 1) an image-to-3D module generation based on the existing generative\\nmodel trained on high-quality 3D assets, and 2) a physically inspired\\ndeformation module to predict intermediate movements. To this end, our method\\ndoes not require templates or object-class-specific prior knowledge and can\\ntake in-the-wild images as input. In our experiments, we demonstrate that\\nTwoSquared is capable of producing texture-consistent and geometry-consistent\\n4D sequences only given 2D images.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T10:39:52Z\"}"}
