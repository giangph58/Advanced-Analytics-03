Both macroscopic (based on number of languages\\nby family) and microscopic (based on numbers of speakers by language on a\\nfamily) aspects of these classifications are examined. Particularly noteworthy\\nis the discovery of a distinct division among the fourteen largest contemporary\\nlanguage families, excluding Afro-Asiatic and Nilo-Saharan languages. These\\nfamilies are found to be distributed across three language family quadruplets,\\neach characterized by significantly different exponents in the Zipf graphs.\\nThis finding sheds light on the underlying structure and organization of major\\nlanguage families, revealing intriguing insights into the nature of linguistic\\ndiversity and distribution.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph,cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:28:59Z\"}"}
