In\\nfuture high energy physics experiments, silicon detectors will be exposed to\\nextremely high fluence environment, which can significantly affect their\\nperformance. It is important to understand the electrical behavior of detectors\\nafter irradiation. In this study, an irradiation simulation framework is\\nconstructed in RASER to simulate leakage current and charge collection\\neffciency. The defect parameters are obtained from the Hamburg penta trap model\\n(HPTM). Based on this work, we predict the similar silicon inner tracker which\\nunder a ten-year CEPC Higgs mode run can still maintain over 90% charge\\ncollection efficiency.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T06:52:32Z\"}"}
