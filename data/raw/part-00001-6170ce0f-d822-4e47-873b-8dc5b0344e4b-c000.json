{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23886v1\", \"title\": \"SchemaAgent: A Multi-Agents Framework for Generating Relational Database\\n  Schema\", \"summary\": \"The relational database design would output a schema based on user's\\nrequirements, which defines table structures and their interrelated relations.\\nTranslating requirements into accurate schema involves several non-trivial\\nsubtasks demanding both database expertise and domain-specific knowledge. This\\nposes unique challenges for automated design of relational databases. Existing\\nefforts are mostly based on customized rules or conventional deep learning\\nmodels, often producing suboptimal schema. Recently, large language models\\n(LLMs) have significantly advanced intelligent application development across\\nvarious domains. In this paper, we propose SchemaAgent, a unified LLM-based\\nmulti-agent framework for the automated generation of high-quality database\\nschema. SchemaAgent is the first to apply LLMs for schema generation, which\\nemulates the workflow of manual schema design by assigning specialized roles to\\nagents and enabling effective collaboration to refine their respective\\nsubtasks. Schema generation is a streamlined workflow, where directly applying\\nthe multi-agent framework may cause compounding impact of errors. To address\\nthis, we incorporate dedicated roles for reflection and inspection, alongside\\nan innovative error detection and correction mechanism to identify and rectify\\nissues across various phases. For evaluation, we present a benchmark named\\n\\\\textit{RSchema}, which contains more than 500 pairs of requirement description\\nand schema. Experimental results on this benchmark demonstrate the superiority\\nof our approach over mainstream LLMs for relational database schema generation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DB\", \"categories\": \"cs.DB,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T09:39:19Z\"}"}
