The protocol relies on a quadratic coupling between the oscillator\\nand a qubit, and is conceptually similar to methods used for preparing cat\\nstates in qubit-oscillator systems. We numerically evaluate the robustness of\\nthe state-preparation scheme in the presence of decoherence, considering\\nenvironmental coupling for both the harmonic oscillator and the qubit. As a\\npotential application, we introduce a quantum error-correcting code based on\\nconditionally-squeezed states and analyze its error-mitigation properties.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:15:08Z\"}"}
