{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01906v1\", \"title\": \"Gaze-Hand Steering for Travel and Multitasking in Virtual Environments\", \"summary\": \"As head-mounted displays (HMDs) with eye-tracking become increasingly\\naccessible, the need for effective gaze-based interfaces in virtual reality\\n(VR) grows. Traditional gaze- or hand-based navigation often limits user\\nprecision or impairs free viewing, making multitasking difficult. We present a\\ngaze-hand steering technique that combines eye-tracking with hand-pointing:\\nusers steer only when gaze aligns with a hand-defined target, reducing\\nunintended actions and enabling free look. Speed is controlled via either a\\njoystick or a waist-level speed circle. We evaluated our method in a user study\\n(N=20) across multitasking and single-task scenarios, comparing it to a similar\\ntechnique. Results show that gaze-hand steering maintains performance and\\nenhances user comfort and spatial awareness during multitasking. Our findings\\nsupport the use of gaze-hand steering in gaze-dominant VR applications\\nrequiring precision and simultaneous interaction. Our method significantly\\nimproves VR navigation in gaze-dominant, multitasking-intensive applications,\\nsupporting immersion and efficient control.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T17:07:01Z\"}"}
