To tackle this issue, past\\nresearch has explored the applicability of traffic correlation techniques to\\nperform attack attribution, i.e., to identify an attacker's true network\\nlocation. However, current traffic correlation approaches rely on\\nwell-provisioned and centralized systems that ingest flows from multiple\\nnetwork probes to compute correlation scores. Unfortunately, this makes\\ncorrelation efforts scale poorly for large high-speed networks.\\n  In this paper, we propose RevealNet, a decentralized framework for attack\\nattribution that orchestrates a fleet of P4-programmable switches to perform\\ntraffic correlation. RevealNet builds on a set of correlation primitives\\ninspired by prior work on computing and comparing flow sketches -- compact\\nsummaries of flows' key characteristics -- to enable efficient, distributed,\\nin-network traffic correlation. Our evaluation suggests that RevealNet achieves\\ncomparable accuracy to centralized attack attribution systems while\\nsignificantly reducing both the computational complexity and bandwidth\\noverheads imposed by correlation tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T15:48:35Z\"}"}
