However, data\\nvisualisations of algorithmic systems in education and other social fields tend\\nto visualise certainty, thus invisibilising the underlying approximations and\\nuncertainties of the algorithmic systems and the social settings in which these\\nsystems operate. This paper draws on a critical speculative approach to first\\nanalyse data visualisations from predictive analytics platforms for education.\\nIt demonstrates that visualisations of uncertainty in education are rare.\\nSecond, the paper explores uncertainty visualisations in other fields (defence,\\nclimate change and healthcare). The paper concludes by reflecting on the role\\nof data visualisations and un/certainty in shaping educational futures.
