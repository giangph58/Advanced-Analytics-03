Liquid crystals (LCs) represent soft\\nmatter with a remarkable combination of fluidity and anisotropic properties.\\nTopological defects may appear in confined LCs under external stimuli. Recently\\ndiscovered ferroelectric nematics (NF) opened exceptional opportunities in\\ntechnologies owing to high permittivity and polarisation. Polar properties of\\nNF supply more variability to topological structures. In this research, we\\npresent tunable 2D topological defect arrays in NF compound, induced by an\\nalternating (AC) electric field in simple sandwich cells without\\npre-patterning. The observed arrays of defects form pseudo-square lattices,\\nwhich character and periodicity depend on the frequency of the applied field\\nand partially on the cell thickness. The observed effect is explained to occur\\ndue to the competition between elastic and electrical forces. The proposed\\nsystem can be useful to create reconfigurable spatially periodic polarisation\\nstructures.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:53:41Z\"}"}
