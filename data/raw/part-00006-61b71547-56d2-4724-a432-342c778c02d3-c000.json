Here, we propose a QPT approach based on\\nuniversal compilation, which systematically decomposes quantum processes into\\noptimized Kraus operators and Choi matrices. This method utilizes efficient\\nalgorithms to improve accuracy while reducing resource requirements. We\\nbenchmark our approach through numerical simulations of random unitary gates,\\ndemonstrating highly accurate quantum process characterization. Additionally,\\nwe apply it to dephasing processes with time-homogeneous and time-inhomogeneous\\nnoise, achieving improved fidelity and robustness. Our work further enables\\nbroader applications in quantum error correction and device validation.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T08:34:33Z\"}"}
