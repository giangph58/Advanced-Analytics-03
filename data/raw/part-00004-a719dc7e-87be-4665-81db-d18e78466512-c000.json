{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20514v1\", \"title\": \"Distributed U6G ELAA Communication Systems: Channel Measurement and\\n  Small-Scale Fading Characterization\", \"summary\": \"The distributed upper 6 GHz (U6G) extra-large scale antenna array (ELAA) is a\\nkey enabler for future wireless communication systems, offering higher\\nthroughput and wider coverage, similar to existing ELAA systems, while\\neffectively mitigating unaffordable complexity and hardware overhead. Uncertain\\nchannel characteristics, however, present significant bottleneck problems that\\nhinder the hardware structure and algorithm design of the distributed U6G ELAA\\nsystem. In response, we construct a U6G channel sounder and carry out extensive\\nmeasurement campaigns across various typical scenarios. Initially, U6G channel\\ncharacteristics, particularly small-scale fading characteristics, are unveiled\\nand compared across different scenarios. Subsequently, the U6G ELAA channel\\ncharacteristics are analyzed using a virtual array comprising 64 elements.\\nFurthermore, inspired by the potential for distributed processing, we\\ninvestigate U6G ELAA channel characteristics from the perspectives of subarrays\\nand sub-bands, including subarray-wise nonstationarities, consistencies,\\nfar-field approximations, and sub-band characteristics. Through a combination\\nof analysis and measurement validation, several insights and benefits,\\nparticularly suitable for distributed processing in U6G ELAA systems, are\\nrevealed, which provides practical validation for the deployment of U6G ELAA\\nsystems.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T07:57:08Z\"}"}
