However, the multi-tiered and\\nglobal-scale nature of SAGSINs also amplifies the security vulnerabilities,\\nparticularly due to the hidden, passive eavesdroppers distributed throughout\\nthe network. In this paper, we introduce a joint optimization framework for\\nmulti-hop relaying in SAGSINs that maximizes the minimum user throughput while\\nensuring a minimum strictly positive secure connection (SPSC) probability. We\\nfirst derive a closed-form expression for the SPSC probability and incorporate\\nthis into a cross-layer optimization framework that jointly optimizes radio\\nresources and relay routes. Specifically, we propose an $\\\\mathcal{O}(1)$\\noptimal frequency allocation and power splitting strategy-dividing power levels\\nof data transmission and cooperative jamming. We then introduce a Monte-Carlo\\nrelay routing algorithm that closely approaches the performance of the\\nnumerical upper-bound method. We validate our framework on testbeds built with\\nreal-world dataset. All source code and data for reproducing the numerical\\nexperiments will be open-sourced.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T14:59:47Z\"}"}
