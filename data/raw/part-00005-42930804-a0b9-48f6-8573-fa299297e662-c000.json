{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04267v1\", \"title\": \"Lattice tilings of Hilbert spaces\", \"summary\": \"We construct a bounded and symmetric convex body in $\\\\ell_2(\\\\Gamma)$ (for\\ncertain cardinals $\\\\Gamma$) whose translates yield a tiling of\\n$\\\\ell_2(\\\\Gamma)$. This answers a question due to Fonf and Lindenstrauss. As a\\nconsequence, we obtain the first example of an infinite-dimensional reflexive\\nBanach space that admits a tiling with balls (of radius $1$). Further, our\\ntiling has the property of being point-countable and lattice (in the sense that\\nthe set of translates forms a group). The same construction performed in\\n$\\\\ell_1(\\\\Gamma)$ yields a point-$2$-finite lattice tiling by balls of radius\\n$1$ for $\\\\ell_1(\\\\Gamma)$, which compares to a celebrated construction due to\\nKlee. We also prove that lattice tilings by balls are never disjoint and, more\\ngenerally, each tile intersects as many tiles as the cardinality of the tiling.\\nFinally, we prove some results concerning discrete subgroups of normed spaces.\\nBy a simplification of the proof of our main result, we prove that every\\ninfinite-dimensional normed space contains a subgroup that is $1$-separated and\\n$(1+\\\\varepsilon)$-dense, for every $\\\\varepsilon>0$; further, the subgroup\\nadmits a set of generators of norm at most $2+\\\\varepsilon$. This solves a\\nproblem due to Swanepoel and yields a simpler proof of a result of Dilworth,\\nOdell, Schlumprecht, and Zs\\\\'ak. We also give an alternative elementary proof\\nof Stepr\\\\={a}ns' result that discrete subgroups of normed spaces are free.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T09:18:56Z\"}"}
