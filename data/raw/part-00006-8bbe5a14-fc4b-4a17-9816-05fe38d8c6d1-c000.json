Due to a lack of complete data, Bayesian\\ninference for these models often relies on data-augmentation techniques. These\\ntechniques are often inefficient or time consuming to implement. We introduce a\\nnovel data-augmentation Markov chain Monte Carlo method for discrete-time\\nindividual-based epidemic models, which we call the Rippler algorithm. This\\nmethod uses the transmission model in the proposal step of the\\nMetropolis-Hastings algorithm, rather than in the accept-reject step. We test\\nthe Rippler algorithm on simulated data and apply it to data on\\nextended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli collected in\\nBlantyre, Malawi. We compare the Rippler algorithm to two other commonly used\\nBayesian inference methods for partially observed epidemic data, and find that\\nit has a good balance between mixing speed and computational complexity.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T07:46:46Z\"}"}
