To explore how this relation behaves under dynamical\\nprocesses, we consider covariant gravitational phase space enhanced with bulk\\nconformal symmetry. As is well known, the Noether-Wald entropy has an explicit\\nform in terms of the Abbott-Deser-Tekin conserved surface charges of gauge\\ntheories. We find a new vector contribution to the Abbott-Deser-Tekin charges\\nthat arises for conformal symmetries. In applying this to the causal diamond,\\nwe derive a general relation for surface gravity, based on the conformal\\ninvariance of horizons, that allows us to find slices where the zeroth law\\nholds, as well as the degree to which a first law arises on the phase space.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T10:43:37Z\"}"}
