In\\neach period, each agent learns about an unknown state by observing a private\\nsignal and her neighbors' actions in the previous period before taking an\\naction herself. Our main result shows that the learning rate of the slowest\\nlearning agent is bounded from above independently of the number of agents, the\\nnetwork structure, and the agents' strategies. Applying this result to\\nequilibrium learning with rational agents shows that the learning rate of all\\nagents in any equilibrium is bounded under general conditions. This extends\\nrecent findings on equilibrium learning and demonstrates that the limitation\\nstems from an inherent tradeoff between optimal action choices and information\\nrevelation rather than strategic considerations.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.TH\", \"categories\": \"econ.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T14:50:22Z\"}"}
