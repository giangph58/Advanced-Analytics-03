Bhaskara, Higashitani, and Shibu Deepthi recently computed the\\n$h$-polynomial for the quotient ring $R/I_G$, where $I_G$ is the toric ideal of\\n$G$, in terms of the number and sizes of odd cycles in the graph. The purpose\\nof this note is to prove the stronger result that these toric ideals are\\ngeometrically vertex decomposable, which allows us to deduce the result of\\nBhaskara, Higashitani, and Shibu Deepthi about the $h$-polyhomial as a\\ncorollary.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AC\", \"categories\": \"math.AC,math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T16:55:17Z\"}"}
