Having the\\ns*-compressibility at hand, one can design adaptive wavelet algorithms which\\nare asymptotically optimal, meaning that any target accuracy can be achieved at\\na computational expense that stays proportional to the number of degrees of\\nfreedom (within the setting determined by an underlying wavelet basis) that\\nwould ideally be necessary for realising that target accuracy if full knowledge\\nabout the unknown solution were given. As we consider here anisotropic wavelet\\ncoordinates, we can achieve higher convergence rates compared to the standard,\\nisotropic setting. Especially, edge singularities of anisotropic nature can be\\nresolved.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:42:01Z\"}"}
