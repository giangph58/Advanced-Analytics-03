{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20822v1\", \"title\": \"An approach to melodic segmentation and classification based on\\n  filtering with the Haar-wavelet\", \"summary\": \"We present a novel method of classification and segmentation of melodies in\\nsymbolic representation. The method is based on filtering pitch as a signal\\nover time with the Haar-wavelet, and we evaluate it on two tasks. The filtered\\nsignal corresponds to a single-scale signal ws from the continuous Haar wavelet\\ntransform. The melodies are first segmented using local maxima or\\nzero-crossings of w_s. The segments of w_s are then classified using the\\nk-nearest neighbour algorithm with Euclidian and city-block distances. The\\nmethod proves more effective than using unfiltered pitch signals and\\nGestalt-based segmentation when used to recognize the parent works of segments\\nfrom Bach's Two-Part Inventions (BWV 772-786). When used to classify 360 Dutch\\nfolk tunes into 26 tune families, the performance of the method is comparable\\nto the use of pitch signals, but not as good as that of string-matching methods\\nbased on multiple features.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:41:03Z\"}"}
