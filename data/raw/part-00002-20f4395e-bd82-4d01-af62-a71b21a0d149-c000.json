To address this challenge, this paper explores the\\nuse of reputation systems as a remedy. We propose RepuNet, a dynamic,\\ndual-level reputation framework that models both agent-level reputation\\ndynamics and system-level network evolution. Specifically, driven by direct\\ninteractions and indirect gossip, agents form reputations for both themselves\\nand their peers, and decide whether to connect or disconnect other agents for\\nfuture interactions. Through two distinct scenarios, we show that RepuNet\\neffectively mitigates the 'tragedy of the commons', promoting and sustaining\\ncooperation in generative MASs. Moreover, we find that reputation systems can\\ngive rise to rich emergent behaviors in generative MASs, such as the formation\\nof cooperative clusters, the social isolation of exploitative agents, and the\\npreference for sharing positive gossip rather than negative ones.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.MA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T08:02:20Z\"}"}
