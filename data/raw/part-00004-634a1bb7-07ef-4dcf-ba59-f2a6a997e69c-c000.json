{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04611v1\", \"title\": \"Particle Gibbs without the Gibbs bit\", \"summary\": \"Exact parameter and trajectory inference in state-space models is typically\\nachieved by one of two methods: particle marginal Metropolis-Hastings (PMMH) or\\nparticle Gibbs (PGibbs). PMMH is a pseudo-marginal algorithm which jointly\\nproposes a new trajectory and parameter, and accepts or rejects both at once.\\nPGibbs instead alternates between sampling from the trajectory, using an\\nalgorithm known as conditional sequential Monte Carlo (CSMC) and the parameter\\nin a Hastings-within-Gibbs fashion. While particle independent Metropolis\\nHastings (PIMH), the parameter-free version of PMMH, is known to be\\nstatistically worse than CSMC, PGibbs can induce a slow mixing if the parameter\\nand the state trajectory are very correlated. This has made PMMH the method of\\nchoice for many practitioners, despite theory and experiments favouring CSMC\\nover PIMH for the parameter-free problem. In this article, we describe a\\nformulation of PGibbs which bypasses the Gibbs step, essentially marginalizing\\nover the trajectory distribution in a fashion similar to PMMH. This is achieved\\nby considering the implementation of a CSMC algortihm for the state-space model\\nintegrated over the joint distribution of the current parameter and the\\nparameter proposal. We illustrate the benefits of method on a simple example\\nknown to be challenging for PMMH.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.CO\", \"categories\": \"stat.CO,eess.SP,stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T17:55:32Z\"}"}
