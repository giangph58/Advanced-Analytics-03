The result\\nis an exact series expansion whose terms, for a perturbation of the form\\n$\\\\delta V=\\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{r^{s}}$, are calculated in closed form. To validate the\\nmethod, the series is applied to the specific case of s=3, and the results are\\ncompared with those presented in literature, which are relate to the\\nSchwarzschild metric. As a further test, a numerical simulation was carried out\\nfor the case where s=4. The algebraic calculations and numerical simulations\\nwere carried out via software with symbolic capabilities.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T12:22:34Z\"}"}
