As an application, we prove a mass concentration theorem\\nfor the quarternionic plurisubharmonic envelope.\\n  In the study of complex Monge-Amp\\\\`ere equation, characterization of finite\\nenergy range of complex Monge-Amp\\\\`ere operator was a central problem which\\naroused the interest of experts in the subject. As a quaternionic analogue, we\\nprove a theorem which explicitly characterizes the finite energy range of\\n\\\\emph{quaternionic} Monge-Amp\\\\`ere operator in the end.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CV\", \"categories\": \"math.CV,math.AP,math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T09:27:39Z\"}"}
