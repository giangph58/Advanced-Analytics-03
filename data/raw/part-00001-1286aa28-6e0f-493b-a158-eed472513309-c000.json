A new set of constraints exploits a quasi-periodic\\nstructure of RMBPs to guarantee passive safety. Particularly, this can be\\nexpressed as simple geometric constraints by solving optimal control in Local\\nToroidal Coordinates, which is based on a local eigenspace of a quasi-periodic\\nmotion around the corresponding periodic orbit. The proposed formulation\\nenables a significant simplification of problem structure, which is highly\\napplicable to large-scale swarm reconfiguration in cislunar orbits. The method\\nis demonstrated in various models of RMBPs (Elliptical Restricted Three-Body\\nProblem and Bi-Circular Restricted Four-Body Problem) and also validated in the\\nfull-ephemeris dynamics. By extending and generalizing well-known concepts from\\nthe two- to the three- and four-body problems, this paper lays the foundation\\nfor the practical control schemes of relative motion in cislunar space.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.SY,eess.SY,math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T03:13:28Z\"}"}
