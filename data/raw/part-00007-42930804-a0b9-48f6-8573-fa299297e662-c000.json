{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04269v1\", \"title\": \"Accelerating Triangle Counting with Real Processing-in-Memory Systems\", \"summary\": \"Triangle Counting (TC) is a procedure that involves enumerating the number of\\ntriangles within a graph. It has important applications in numerous fields,\\nsuch as social or biological network analysis and network security. TC is a\\nmemory-bound workload that does not scale efficiently in conventional\\nprocessor-centric systems due to several memory accesses across large memory\\nregions and low data reuse. However, recent Processing-in-Memory (PIM)\\narchitectures present a promising solution to alleviate these bottlenecks. Our\\nwork presents the first TC algorithm that leverages the capabilities of the\\nUPMEM system, the first commercially available PIM architecture, while at the\\nsame time addressing its limitations. We use a vertex coloring technique to\\navoid expensive communication between PIM cores and employ reservoir sampling\\nto address the limited amount of memory available in the PIM cores' DRAM banks.\\nIn addition, our work makes use of the Misra-Gries summary to speed up counting\\ntriangles on graphs with high-degree nodes and uniform sampling of the graph\\nedges for quicker approximate results. Our PIM implementation surpasses\\nstate-of-the-art CPU-based TC implementations when processing dynamic graphs in\\nCoordinate List format, showcasing the effectiveness of the UPMEM architecture\\nin addressing TC's memory-bound challenges.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AR\", \"categories\": \"cs.AR,cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T09:20:03Z\"}"}
