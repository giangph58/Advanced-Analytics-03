Following voice conversion using a HiFi-GAN\\nvocoder, we compare information leakage for a range speaker characteristics;\\nassuming a \\\"worst-case\\\" white-box scenario, we quantify our confidence to\\nperform inference and narrow the pool of likely source speakers, reinforcing\\nthe regulatory obligation and moral duty that providers of synthetic voices\\nhave to ensure the privacy of their speakers' data.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SD\", \"categories\": \"cs.SD,cs.CR,eess.AS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T12:09:03Z\"}"}
