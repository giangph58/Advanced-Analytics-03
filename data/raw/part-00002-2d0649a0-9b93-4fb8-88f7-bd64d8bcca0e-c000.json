That is, it has infinitely many twisted conjugacy classes for any\\ntwisting automorphism. We deduce that having property $R_{\\\\infty}$ is\\nundecidable amongst finitely presented groups.\\n  We also show that the same is true for a wide class of relatively hyperbolic\\ngroups, filling in some of the gaps in the literature. Specifically, we show\\nthat a non-elementary, finitely presented relatively hyperbolic group with\\nfinitely generated peripheral subgroups which are not themselves relatively\\nhyperbolic, has property $R_{\\\\infty}$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GR\", \"categories\": \"math.GR,math.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T11:55:40Z\"}"}
