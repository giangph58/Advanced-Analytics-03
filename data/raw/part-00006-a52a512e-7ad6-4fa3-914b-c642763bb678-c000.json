{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07675v1\", \"title\": \"Low-Complexity Optimization of Antenna Switching Schemes for Dynamic\\n  Channel Sounding\", \"summary\": \"Understanding wireless channels is crucial for the design of wireless\\nsystems. For mobile communication, sounders and antenna arrays with short\\nmeasurement times are required to simultaneously capture the dynamic and\\nspatial channel characteristics. Switched antenna arrays are an attractive\\noption that can overcome the high cost of real arrays and the long measurement\\ntimes of virtual arrays. Optimization of the switching sequences is then\\nessential to avoid aliasing and increase the accuracy of channel parameter\\nestimates. This paper provides a novel and comprehensive analysis of the design\\nof switching sequences. We first review the conventional spatio-temporal\\nambiguity function, extend it to dual-polarized antenna arrays, and analyze its\\nprohibitive complexity when designing for ultra-massive antenna arrays. We thus\\npropose a new method that uses the Fisher information matrix to tackle the\\nestimation accuracy. We also propose to minimize the ambiguity by choosing a\\nswitching sequence that minimizes side lobes in its Fourier spectrum. In this\\nsense, we divide the sequence design problem into Fourier-based ambiguity\\nreduction and Fisher-based accuracy improvement, and coin the resulting design\\napproach as Fourier-Fisher. Simulations and measurements show that the\\nFourier-Fisher approach achieves identical performance and significantly lower\\ncomputational complexity than that of the conventional ambiguity-based\\napproach.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T11:56:37Z\"}"}
