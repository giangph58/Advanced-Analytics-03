{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07498v1\", \"title\": \"Learning Joint Source-Channel Encoding in IRS-assisted Multi-User\\n  Semantic Communications\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we investigate a joint source-channel encoding (JSCE) scheme\\nin an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted multi-user semantic\\ncommunication system. Semantic encoding not only compresses redundant\\ninformation, but also enhances information orthogonality in a semantic feature\\nspace. Meanwhile, the IRS can adjust the spatial orthogonality, enabling\\nconcurrent multi-user semantic communication in densely deployed wireless\\nnetworks to improve spectrum efficiency. We aim to maximize the users' semantic\\nthroughput by jointly optimizing the users' scheduling, the IRS's passive\\nbeamforming, and the semantic encoding strategies. To tackle this non-convex\\nproblem, we propose an explainable deep neural network-driven deep\\nreinforcement learning (XD-DRL) framework. Specifically, we employ a deep\\nneural network (DNN) to serve as a joint source-channel semantic encoder,\\nenabling transmitters to extract semantic features from raw images. By\\nleveraging structural similarity, we assign some DNN weight coefficients as the\\nIRS's phase shifts, allowing simultaneous optimization of IRS's passive\\nbeamforming and DNN training. Given the IRS's passive beamforming and semantic\\nencoding strategies, user scheduling is optimized using the DRL method.\\nNumerical results validate that our JSCE scheme achieves superior semantic\\nthroughput compared to the conventional schemes and efficiently reduces the\\nsemantic encoder's mode size in multi-user scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T06:53:48Z\"}"}
