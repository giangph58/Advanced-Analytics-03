{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03422v1\", \"title\": \"LiftFeat: 3D Geometry-Aware Local Feature Matching\", \"summary\": \"Robust and efficient local feature matching plays a crucial role in\\napplications such as SLAM and visual localization for robotics. Despite great\\nprogress, it is still very challenging to extract robust and discriminative\\nvisual features in scenarios with drastic lighting changes, low texture areas,\\nor repetitive patterns. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight network\\ncalled \\\\textit{LiftFeat}, which lifts the robustness of raw descriptor by\\naggregating 3D geometric feature. Specifically, we first adopt a pre-trained\\nmonocular depth estimation model to generate pseudo surface normal label,\\nsupervising the extraction of 3D geometric feature in terms of predicted\\nsurface normal. We then design a 3D geometry-aware feature lifting module to\\nfuse surface normal feature with raw 2D descriptor feature. Integrating such 3D\\ngeometric feature enhances the discriminative ability of 2D feature description\\nin extreme conditions. Extensive experimental results on relative pose\\nestimation, homography estimation, and visual localization tasks, demonstrate\\nthat our LiftFeat outperforms some lightweight state-of-the-art methods.
