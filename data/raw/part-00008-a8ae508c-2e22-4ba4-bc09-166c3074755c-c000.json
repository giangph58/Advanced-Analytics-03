{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13050v1\", \"title\": \"Radiative properties of a nonsingular black hole: Hawking radiation and\\n  gray-body factor\", \"summary\": \"We study the radiative properties of a spherical and singularity-free\\nblack-hole geometry recently proposed in the literature. Contrary to the\\nSchwarzschild spacetime, this geometry is geodesically complete and regular,\\nand, instead of the singularity, it presents a minimal surface that connects a\\ntrapped (black-hole) with an antitrapped (white-hole) region. The geometry is\\ncharacterized by two parameters: the Schwarzschild radius and another parameter\\nthat measures the area of the minimal surface. This parameter is related to\\ncertain corrections expected in the context of loop quantum gravity to the\\nclassical general-relativistic dynamics. We explicitly compute the spectrum of\\nthe Hawking radiation and the gray-body factor. Since the gravitational\\npotential is shallower than in Schwarzschild, the emission spectrum turns out\\nbe colder and purer (less gray). From this, we sketch the evaporation history\\nof this geometry and conclude that, instead of completely evaporating, it\\nnaturally leads to a remnant, which provides a possible resolution of the\\ninformation loss issue.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T16:07:11Z\"}"}
