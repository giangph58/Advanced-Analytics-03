In this paper we study graded free resolutions of $R/I$ as\\n$A$-module whenever $A :=\\\\Bbbk[x_{n-d+1},\\\\ldots,x_n]$ is a Noether\\nnormalization of $R/I$. We exhibit a Schreyer-like method to compute a\\n(non-necessarily minimal) graded free resolution of $R/I$ as $A$-module. When\\n$R/I$ is a $3$-dimensional simplicial toric ring, we describe how to prune the\\nprevious resolution to obtain a minimal one. We finally provide an example of a\\n$6$-dimensional simplicial toric ring whose Betti numbers, both as $R$-module\\nand as $A$-module, depend on the characteristic of $\\\\Bbbk$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AC\", \"categories\": \"math.AC,math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T12:23:06Z\"}"}
