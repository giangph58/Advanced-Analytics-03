{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15587v1\", \"title\": \"MetaMolGen: A Neural Graph Motif Generation Model for De Novo Molecular\\n  Design\", \"summary\": \"Molecular generation plays an important role in drug discovery and materials\\nscience, especially in data-scarce scenarios where traditional generative\\nmodels often struggle to achieve satisfactory conditional generalization. To\\naddress this challenge, we propose MetaMolGen, a first-order\\nmeta-learning-based molecular generator designed for few-shot and\\nproperty-conditioned molecular generation. MetaMolGen standardizes the\\ndistribution of graph motifs by mapping them to a normalized latent space, and\\nemploys a lightweight autoregressive sequence model to generate SMILES\\nsequences that faithfully reflect the underlying molecular structure. In\\naddition, it supports conditional generation of molecules with target\\nproperties through a learnable property projector integrated into the\\ngenerative process.Experimental results demonstrate that MetaMolGen\\nconsistently generates valid and diverse SMILES sequences under low-data\\nregimes, outperforming conventional baselines. This highlights its advantage in\\nfast adaptation and efficient conditional generation for practical molecular\\ndesign.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T05:04:33Z\"}"}
