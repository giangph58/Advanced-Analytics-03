{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03627v1\", \"title\": \"Revisiting Lower Bounds for Two-Step Consensus\", \"summary\": \"A seminal result by Lamport shows that at least $\\\\max\\\\{2e+f+1,2f+1\\\\}$\\nprocesses are required to implement partially synchronous consensus that\\ntolerates $f$ process failures and can furthermore decide in two message delays\\nunder $e$ failures. This lower bound is matched by the classical Fast Paxos\\nprotocol. However, more recent practical protocols, such as Egalitarian Paxos,\\nprovide two-step decisions with fewer processes, seemingly contradicting the\\nlower bound. We show that this discrepancy arises because the classical bound\\nrequires two-step decisions under a wide range of scenarios, not all of which\\nare relevant in practice. We propose a more pragmatic condition for which we\\nestablish tight bounds on the number of processes required. Interestingly,\\nthese bounds depend on whether consensus is implemented as an atomic object or\\na decision task. For consensus as an object, $\\\\max\\\\{2e+f-1,2f+1\\\\}$ processes\\nare necessary and sufficient for two-step decisions, while for a task the tight\\nbound is $\\\\max\\\\{2e+f, 2f+1\\\\}$.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:28:05Z\"}"}
