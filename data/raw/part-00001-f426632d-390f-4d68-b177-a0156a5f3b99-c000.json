It is grounded on an\\nExtended Feature Model that models a general fairness benchmarking workflow as\\na Software Product Line. The constraints defined among the features guide users\\nin creating experiments that do not lead to execution errors. We describe the\\narchitecture and implementation of MANILA and evaluate it in terms of\\nexpressiveness and correctness.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T16:24:48Z\"}"}
