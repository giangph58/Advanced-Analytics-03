{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14836v1\", \"title\": \"Systematic search for blue hyper-velocity stars from LAMOST survey\", \"summary\": \"Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) represent a unique class of objects capable of\\nescaping the gravitational pull of the Milky Way due to extreme acceleration\\nevents, such as close encounters with the supermassive black hole at the\\nGalactic center (GC), supernova explosions in binary systems, or multi-body\\ndynamical interactions. Finding and studying HVSs are crucial to exploring\\nthese ejection mechanisms, characterizing central black holes, probing the GC\\nenvironment, and revealing the distribution of dark matter in our galaxy. The\\nLarge Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST)\\nspectroscopic surveys have so far identified four B-type unbound HVSs. To\\nexpand this sample with the second-phase LAMOST survey that started in 2018, we\\nconducted a systematic search for early-type HVSs using the LAMOST Data Release\\n10. We identified 125 early-type high-velocity candidates with total velocities\\nexceeding 300 km\\\\,s$^{-1}$. Among them, we report ten new unbound B- and A-type\\nhypervelocity star (HVS) candidates (designated LAMOST-HVS5 through\\nLAMOST-HVS14), tripling the number of unbound HVSs previously identified by\\nLAMOST. Kinematic analyses suggest that these newly discovered HVS candidates\\nlikely originated either from the Galactic Center or via dynamical\\ninteractions. Future high-resolution follow-up observations promise to refine\\nthe stellar parameters, distances, and elemental abundances of these\\ncandidates, thereby providing deeper insights into their origins and broadening\\ntheir potential applications across astrophysics.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T03:34:00Z\"}"}
