A key capability\\nis the integration of long-term memory capabilities, enabling these agents to\\ndraw upon historical interactions and knowledge. However, the growing memory\\nsize and need for semantic structuring pose significant challenges. In this\\nwork, we propose an autonomous memory augmentation approach, MemInsight, to\\nenhance semantic data representation and retrieval mechanisms. By leveraging\\nautonomous augmentation to historical interactions, LLM agents are shown to\\ndeliver more accurate and contextualized responses. We empirically validate the\\nefficacy of our proposed approach in three task scenarios; conversational\\nrecommendation, question answering and event summarization. On the LLM-REDIAL\\ndataset, MemInsight boosts persuasiveness of recommendations by up to 14%.\\nMoreover, it outperforms a RAG baseline by 34% in recall for LoCoMo retrieval.\\nOur empirical results show the potential of MemInsight to enhance the\\ncontextual performance of LLM agents across multiple tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:57:28Z\"}"}
