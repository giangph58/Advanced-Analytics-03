The bittide system addresses this by providing logical\\nsynchronization through a decentralized control mechanism that observes local\\nbuffer occupancies and controls the frequency of an oscillator at each node. A\\ncritical aspect of bittide's stability and performance is ensuring that these\\nelastic buffers operate around a desired equilibrium point, preventing data\\nloss due to overflow or underflow. This paper introduces a novel method for\\ncentering buffer occupancies in a bittide network using a technique we term\\nframe rotation. We propose a control strategy utilizing a directed spanning\\ntree of the network graph. By adjusting the frequencies of nodes in a specific\\norder dictated by this tree, and employing a pulsed feedback controller that\\ntargets the buffer occupancy of edges within the spanning tree, we prove that\\nall elastic buffers in the network can be driven to their desired equilibrium.\\nThis ordered adjustment approach ensures that prior centering efforts are not\\ndisrupted, providing a robust mechanism for managing buffer occupancy in\\nbittide synchronized systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T17:02:27Z\"}"}
