Classically, the UFDs are (completely)\\nintegrally closed and tend to behave well in standard ring extensions, with the\\nnotable exception of power series extension. The half-factorial property is not\\nas robust; HFDs need not be integrally closed and the half-factorial property\\nis not necessarily preserved in integral extensions or even localizations. Here\\nwe exhibit classes of HFDs that behave well in (almost) integral extensions,\\nresolve an open question on the behavior of the boundary map, and give a\\nsqueeze theorem for elasticity in certain domains.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AC\", \"categories\": \"math.AC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T17:05:28Z\"}"}
