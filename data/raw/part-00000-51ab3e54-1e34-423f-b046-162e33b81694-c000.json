{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03484v1\", \"title\": \"STAR-Rec: Making Peace with Length Variance and Pattern Diversity in\\n  Sequential Recommendation\", \"summary\": \"Recent deep sequential recommendation models often struggle to effectively\\nmodel key characteristics of user behaviors, particularly in handling sequence\\nlength variations and capturing diverse interaction patterns. We propose\\nSTAR-Rec, a novel architecture that synergistically combines preference-aware\\nattention and state-space modeling through a sequence-level mixture-of-experts\\nframework. STAR-Rec addresses these challenges by: (1) employing\\npreference-aware attention to capture both inherently similar item\\nrelationships and diverse preferences, (2) utilizing state-space modeling to\\nefficiently process variable-length sequences with linear complexity, and (3)\\nincorporating a mixture-of-experts component that adaptively routes different\\nbehavioral patterns to specialized experts, handling both focused\\ncategory-specific browsing and diverse category exploration patterns. We\\ntheoretically demonstrate how the state space model and attention mechanisms\\ncan be naturally unified in recommendation scenarios, where SSM captures\\ntemporal dynamics through state compression while attention models both similar\\nand diverse item relationships. Extensive experiments on four real-world\\ndatasets demonstrate that STAR-Rec consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\\nsequential recommendation methods, particularly in scenarios involving diverse\\nuser behaviors and varying sequence lengths.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T12:40:38Z\"}"}
