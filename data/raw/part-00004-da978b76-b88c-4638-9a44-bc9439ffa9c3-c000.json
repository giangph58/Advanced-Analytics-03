SOT\\nswitching of perpendicularly magnetized ferromagnet in the heavy\\nmetal/ferromagnet bilayer of SOT-MRAM unit cell requires an additional external\\nmagnetic field to support the spin-orbit torque generated by heavy metal to\\ncause deterministic switching. This complexity can be overcome if an internal\\nfield can be generated to break the switching symmetry. We experimentally\\ndemonstrate that by engineering the shape of ferromagnet, an internal magnetic\\nfield capable of breaking the switching symmetry can be generated, which allows\\nfor deterministic switching by spin-orbit torques. We fabricated nanomagnets of\\nCobalt with triangular shape on top of Platinum and showed external magnetic\\nfield free switching between the two stable states of magnetization by\\napplication of nano-second voltage pulses. The experimental findings are\\nconsistent with the micro-magnetic simulation results of the proposed geometry.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:40:10Z\"}"}
