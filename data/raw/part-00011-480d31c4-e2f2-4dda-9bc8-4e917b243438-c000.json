It is shown that for every static, spherically symmetric, vacuum\\nblack hole space-time, a corresponding black hole solution can be derived,\\nwhere the Hawking temperature is identical with the R\\\\'enyi temperature, i.e.\\nthe one obtained from the R\\\\'enyi entropy of the black hole via the 1st law of\\nthermodynamics. In order to have this Hawking-R\\\\'enyi type thermodynamic\\nproperty, the black holes must be surrounded by an anisotropic fluid in the\\nform of a Kiselev metric, where the properties of the fluid are uniquely\\ndetermined by the mass of the black hole, $M$, and the R\\\\'enyi parameter,\\n{\\\\lambda}. In the simplest Schwarzschild scenario, the system is found to be\\nthermodynamically unstable, and the 3rd law of thermodynamics seems to play the\\nrole of a cosmic censor via placing an upper bound on the black hole's mass, by\\nwhich preventing the black hole from loosing its horizon(s).\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,cond-mat.stat-mech,hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T13:37:41Z\"}"}
