{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11885v1\", \"title\": \"HyperSAT: Unsupervised Hypergraph Neural Networks for Weighted MaxSAT\\n  Problems\", \"summary\": \"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising performance in solving both\\nBoolean satisfiability (SAT) and Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) problems due\\nto their ability to efficiently model and capture the structural dependencies\\nbetween literals and clauses. However, GNN methods for solving Weighted MaxSAT\\nproblems remain underdeveloped. The challenges arise from the non-linear\\ndependency and sensitive objective function, which are caused by the\\nnon-uniform distribution of weights across clauses. In this paper, we present\\nHyperSAT, a novel neural approach that employs an unsupervised hypergraph\\nneural network model to solve Weighted MaxSAT problems. We propose a hypergraph\\nrepresentation for Weighted MaxSAT instances and design a cross-attention\\nmechanism along with a shared representation constraint loss function to\\ncapture the logical interactions between positive and negative literal nodes in\\nthe hypergraph. Extensive experiments on various Weighted MaxSAT datasets\\ndemonstrate that HyperSAT achieves better performance than state-of-the-art\\ncompetitors.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T09:11:16Z\"}"}
