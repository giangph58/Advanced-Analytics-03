{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21408v1\", \"title\": \"The maximum mass and rotational kinetic energy of rapidly rotating\\n  neutron stars\", \"summary\": \"Rapid uniformly-rotating neutron stars are expected to be formed for instance\\nin the collapse of some massive stars, the accretion of some compact object\\nbinaries, and some double neutron star mergers. The huge amount of the\\nrotational energy has been widely believed to be the source of some cosmic\\ngamma-ray bursts and superluminous supernovae. Benefited from the tight\\nconstraints on the equation of state of the neutron star matter set by the\\nlatest multi-messenger data, the chiral effective field theory ($\\\\chi$EFT) and\\nperturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD), here we present the maximum\\ngravitational mass as well as the kinetic rotational energy for a neutron star\\nat a given spin period. Our nonparametric EOS analysis reveals that the\\ncritical Keplerian configurations ($\\\\Omega_{\\\\rm kep}^{\\\\rm\\ncrit}=1.00\\\\pm0.07\\\\times 10^{4}~ {\\\\rm rad/s}$) can sustain maximum gravitational\\nmasses of $M_{\\\\rm kep}^{\\\\rm crit}=2.76^{+0.11}_{-0.09} M_\\\\odot$ with\\ncorresponding rotational energy reaching $E_{\\\\rm rot,kep}^{\\\\rm\\ncrit}=2.38^{+0.25}_{-0.24}\\\\times 10^{53}$. However, the maximum rotational\\nenergy that can be feasibly extracted from a neutron star is limited to\\n$1.40^{+0.15}_{-0.13}\\\\times 10^{53}$ erg, which holds for a baryon mass of\\n$2.68^{+0.10}_{-0.09}M_\\\\odot$. All these parameters, obtained via the\\nnonparametric reconstruction of the equation of state, are at the $68.3\\\\%$\\nconfidence level and the adoption of a quarkonic model yields rather similar\\nresults. These findings are found to have already set some intriguing\\nconstraints on the millisecond magnetar interpretation of some exciting data.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T08:08:20Z\"}"}
