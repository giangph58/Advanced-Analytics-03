{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17501v1\", \"title\": \"Surface morphology and thickness variation estimation of zeolites via\\n  electron ptychography\", \"summary\": \"Zeolites, as representative porous materials, possess intricate\\nthree-dimensional frameworks that endow them with high surface areas and\\nremarkable catalytic properties. There are a few factors that give a huge\\ninfluence on the catalytic properties, including the size and connectivity of\\nthese three-dimensional channels and atomic level defects. In additional to\\nthat, the surface morphology and thickness variation of zeolites particles are\\nessential to their catalytic performances as well. However, it is a significant\\nchallenge to characterize these macroscopic properties of zeolites using\\nconventional techniques due to their sensitivity to electron beams. In this\\nstudy, we introduce surface-adaptive electron ptychography, an advanced\\napproach based on multi-slice electron ptychography, which enables\\nhigh-precision reconstruction of both local atomic configurations and global\\nstructural features in zeolite nanoparticles. By adaptively optimizing probe\\ndefocus and slice thickness during the reconstruction process, SAEP\\nsuccessfully resolves surface morphology, thickness variations and atomic\\nstructure simultaneously. This integrated framework facilitates a direct and\\nintuitive correlation between zeolite channel structures and particle\\nthickness. Our findings open new pathways for large-scale, comprehensive\\nstructure property analysis of beam-sensitive porous materials, deepening the\\nunderstanding of their catalytic behavior.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T12:42:55Z\"}"}
