We present\\na detailed analysis focuses on understanding the influence of dyonic charges on\\nthe oscillatory properties of these BHs. The quasinormal modes are calculated\\nto explore the interplay between the dyonic charge and the characteristic\\nfrequencies of perturbations. The results are then systematically compared with\\nthose of black holes possessing purely electric or purely magnetic charges in\\nthe Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg framework. This comparison highlights the unique\\nsignatures and dynamic behavior introduced by the presence of dyonic charges,\\noffering deeper insights into the properties of black holes in nonlinear\\nelectrodynamics theories.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T09:44:48Z\"}"}
