In this regard, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a\\nhighly promising tool for defensive and offensive cybersecurity-related\\nstrategies. While existing literature has focused much on the defensive use of\\nLLMs, when it comes to their offensive utilization, very little has been\\nreported-namely, concerning Vulnerability Assessment (VA) report validation.\\nConsequentially, this paper tries to fill that gap by investigating the\\ncapabilities of LLMs in automating and improving the validation process of the\\nreport of the VA. From the critical review of the related literature, this\\npaper hereby proposes a new approach to using the LLMs in the automation of the\\nanalysis and within the validation process of the report of the VA that could\\npotentially reduce the number of false positives and generally enhance\\nefficiency. These results are promising for LLM automatization for improving\\nvalidation on reports coming from VA in order to improve accuracy while\\nreducing human effort and security postures. The contribution of this paper\\nprovides further evidence about the offensive and defensive LLM capabilities\\nand therefor helps in devising more appropriate cybersecurity strategies and\\ntools accordingly.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T09:14:55Z\"}"}
