Allocating systemic risk measures\", \"summary\": \"Systemic risk measures aggregate the risks from multiple financial\\ninstitutions to find system-wide capital requirements. Though much attention\\nhas been given to assessing the level of systemic risk, less has been given to\\nallocating that risk to the constituent institutions. Within this work, we\\npropose a Nash allocation rule that is inspired by game theory. Intuitively, to\\nconstruct these capital allocations, the banks compete in a game to reduce\\ntheir own capital requirements while, simultaneously, maintaining system-level\\nacceptability. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence and\\nuniqueness of Nash allocation rules, and apply our results to the prominent\\nstructures used for systemic risk measures in the literature. We demonstrate\\nthe efficacy of Nash allocations with numerical case studies using the\\nEisenberg-Noe aggregation mechanism.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.RM\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.RM,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T04:22:02Z\"}"}
