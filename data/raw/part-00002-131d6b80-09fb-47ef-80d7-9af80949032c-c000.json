{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20584v1\", \"title\": \"Hydra: Marker-Free RGB-D Hand-Eye Calibration\", \"summary\": \"This work presents an RGB-D imaging-based approach to marker-free hand-eye\\ncalibration using a novel implementation of the iterative closest point (ICP)\\nalgorithm with a robust point-to-plane (PTP) objective formulated on a Lie\\nalgebra. Its applicability is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments\\nusing three well known serial manipulators and two RGB-D cameras. With only\\nthree randomly chosen robot configurations, our approach achieves approximately\\n90% successful calibrations, demonstrating 2-3x higher convergence rates to the\\nglobal optimum compared to both marker-based and marker-free baselines. We also\\nreport 2 orders of magnitude faster convergence time (0.8 +/- 0.4 s) for 9\\nrobot configurations over other marker-free methods. Our method exhibits\\nsignificantly improved accuracy (5 mm in task space) over classical approaches\\n(7 mm in task space) whilst being marker-free. The benchmarking dataset and\\ncode are open sourced under Apache 2.0 License, and a ROS 2 integration with\\nrobot abstraction is provided to facilitate deployment.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T09:39:59Z\"}"}
