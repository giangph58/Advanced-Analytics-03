In this\\npaper we discover properties implied by the real rootedness of f(t) in terms of\\nthe binomial representation $f_i = \\\\binom{x_{i+1}}{i+1}, i \\\\geq 0$. We use\\nthese to provide a sufficient criterion for a positive answer to the question\\nby Bell and Skandera. We also describe two further approaches to the conjecture\\nand use one to verify that some well studied real rooted classical polynomials\\nare f-polynomials. Finally, we provide a series of results showing that the set\\nof f-vectors of simplicial complexes is closed under constructions also\\npreserving real rootedness of their generating polynomials.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:31:37Z\"}"}
