Our approach investigates the continuity and convergence\\nproperties of the solutions with respect to the underlying distribution $\\\\mu$.\\nWe establish that, under weak convergence of a sequence of probability measures\\n$(\\\\mu_n)$ with bounded support, the corresponding sequence of $\\\\mu_n$-domains\\nconverges to the domain associated with $\\\\mu$, limit of $(\\\\mu_n)$. We derive\\nexplicit convergence results in the $L^1$ norm, supported by a generalization\\nusing the concept of $\\\\alpha_p$-convergence. Furthermore, we provide practical\\nimplementation techniques, convergence rate estimates, and numerical\\nsimulations using various distributions. The method proves robust and\\nadaptable, offering a concrete computational pathway for approximating\\n$\\\\mu$-domains in the PSEP.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T11:27:23Z\"}"}
