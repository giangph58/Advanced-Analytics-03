There are different ways to generate them, often\\nrestricted to a wavelength range. Likewise, characterization techniques\\nfrequently possess similar limitations. In this work, we first generate\\nultrashort optical vortices in the near infrared from Ti:sapphire laser pulses\\nby means of structured waveplates and beam manipulation. Then, we produce the\\nvisible vortices through up-conversion using a second-harmonic generation\\ncrystal. The resulting beams require spatiotemporal characterization, which are\\nperformed by bulk lateral shearing interferometry. The reference pulse is\\ntemporally characterized with the amplitude swing technique. In this manner, we\\npresent the generation of these pulses in the visible range, which are\\nexperimentally validated, and demonstrate that bulk lateral shearing\\ninterferometry can be used for pulsed beams across widely different spectral\\nregions with the same setup. This finding is significant for future\\napplications of the technique with various sources.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,physics.ins-det\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:36:13Z\"}"}
