This framework extends the standard Hilbert space\\ndescription, offering a natural interpretation of standard quantum gates on the\\nRiemann sphere that is examined through their Mobius action on holomorphic\\nwavefunction. These wavefunctions emerge via a quantization process, with the\\nRiemann sphere serving as the classical phase space of qubit geometry. We\\nquantize this space using canonical group quantization with holomorphic\\npolarization, yielding holomorphic wavefunctions and spin angular momentum\\noperators that recover the standard $SU(2)$ algebra with interesting geometric\\nproperties. Such properties reveal how geometric transformations induce quantum\\nlogic gates on the Riemann sphere, providing a novel perspective in quantum\\ninformation processing. This result provides a new direction for exploring\\nquantum computation through Isham's canonical group quantization and its\\nholomorphic polarization method.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T05:24:43Z\"}"}
