This study presents\\na comprehensive evaluation of FuXi-SHTM, a hybrid ML-physics model, using all\\n2024 western North Pacific typhoon cases. The FuXi-SHTM hybrid demonstrates\\nclear improvements in both track and intensity forecasts compared to the\\nstandalone SHTM, FuXi, and ECMWF HRES models. Compared to FuXi alone, FuXi-SHTM\\nreduces typhoon track forecast errors by 16.5% and 5.2% at lead times of 72 h\\nand 120 h, respectively, and reduces intensity forecast errors by 59.7% and\\n47.6%. Furthermore, FuXi-SHTM simulates cloud structures more realistically\\ncompared to SHTM, and achieves superior representation of the 10-m wind fields\\nin both intensity and spatial structure compared to FuXi and SHTM. Increasing\\nthe resolution of FuXi-SHTM from 9 km to 3 km further enhances intensity\\nforecasts, highlighting the critical role of the resolution of the physical\\nmodel in advancing hybrid forecasting capabilities.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T15:21:07Z\"}"}
