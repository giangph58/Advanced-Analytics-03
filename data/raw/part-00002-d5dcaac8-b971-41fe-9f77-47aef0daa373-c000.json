{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15006v1\", \"title\": \"Sum-Rate Maximization for NOMA-Assisted Pinching-Antenna Systems\", \"summary\": \"In this letter, we investigate a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)\\nassisted downlink pinching-antenna system. Leveraging the ability of pinching\\nantennas to flexibly adjust users' wireless channel conditions, we formulate an\\noptimization problem to maximize the sum rate by optimizing both the users'\\npower allocation coefficients and the positions of pinching antennas. The\\noptimal power allocation coefficients are obtained in closed-form by using the\\nKarush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. The optimization problem of pinching\\nantenna placements is more challenging than the power allocation problem, and\\nis solved by a bisection-based search algorithm. In particular, the algorithm\\nfirst optimizes the antenna placements to create favorable channel disparities\\nbetween users, followed by fine-tuning the antenna positions to ensure the\\nphase alignment for users, thus maximizing the sum rate. Simulation results\\ndemonstrate that, compared to conventional-antenna systems, pinching antennas\\ncan significantly enhance the sum rate in NOMA scenarios, and the proposed\\nbisection-based search algorithm can achieve a sum rate nearly equivalent to\\nthat of an exhaustive search.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T10:12:00Z\"}"}
