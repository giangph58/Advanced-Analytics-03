Expectations of ratio-type estimators are often difficult to\\ncompute due to the nature that they are constructed by combining two separate\\nestimators. With the aid of Lukacs' Theorem and the gamma-beta\\n(gamma-Dirichlet) relationship, we provide alternative proofs for the expected\\nvalues of some common ratio-type estimators, including the sample Gini index,\\nthe sample Theil index, and the sample Atkinson index, under the gamma\\ndistribution. Our proofs using the distributional properties of the gamma\\ndistribution are much simpler than the existing ones. In addition, we also\\nderive the expected value of the sample variance-to-mean ratio under the gamma\\ndistribution.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T09:23:28Z\"}"}
