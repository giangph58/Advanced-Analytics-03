In one-dimensional chains with alternating couplings, known as\\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) systems, this includes the formation of\\ntopologically protected mid-gap modes whose intensities localize at the chain's\\nends. This subwavelength localization at optical frequencies is crucial for\\nachieving strong coupling of mid-gap modes to two-level systems under ambient\\nconditions, extending topological protection to hybrid light-matter states.\\nHere, we have fabricated SSH chains from plasmonic nanoslit resonators with\\nstrong inter-resonator coupling. The alternating distance between the nanoslit\\nresonators is controlled with sub-nanometer precision, enabling accurate\\nprediction and experimental observation of topologically protected mid-gap\\nmodes via photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM). Our results open the path\\ntowards experimental realizations of two-dimensional photonic metasurfaces\\nexhibiting higher-order topological modes that can be strongly coupled to\\nsingle emitters and quantum materials at ambient conditions.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:05:17Z\"}"}
