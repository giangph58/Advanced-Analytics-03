Addressing this need, the present study investigates the\\nspectroscopic properties of as a function of temperature. A thermally induced\\nstructural transition from the low-temperature orthorhombic phase to the\\nhigh-temperature trigonal phase, occurring at approximately 430 K,\\nsignificantly alters the spectroscopic properties of Eu3 ions. Specifically, a\\nreduction in the number of Stark lines due to changes in the point symmetry of\\nEu3 ions enables the development of a ratiometric luminescence thermometer with\\nsensitivity as high as K. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that increasing the\\nconcentration of Eu3 ions shifts the phase transition temperature, allowing for\\nmodulation of the thermometric performance of this luminescence thermometer.\\nThe findings presented here not only expand the repertoire of phase\\ntransition-based luminescence thermometers but also illustrate how the\\nluminescence properties of Eu3 ions can be employed to accurately monitor\\nstructural changes in the host material.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:05:57Z\"}"}
