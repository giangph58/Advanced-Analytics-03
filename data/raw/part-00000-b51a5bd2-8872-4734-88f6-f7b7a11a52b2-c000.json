{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24239v1\", \"title\": \"An alternative approach in the generalized Chaplygin gas model in higher\\n  dimensional space-time\", \"summary\": \"In the paper, we have presented a higher-dimensional cosmological model with\\na generalized Chaplygin-type gas to explain the recent acceleration of the\\nuniverse. Dimensional reduction is feasible in this model, and our solutions\\nare general, as they recover all known results of $4D$ Chaplygin-driven\\ncosmology when $d =0$. Using Hubble-$57$ data obtained through the differential\\nage method (DA), the best fit curves are drawn and estimated observational\\nconstraints of the model parameters. A note worthy aspect of the model is that\\nthe resulting field equation is highly nonlinear with respect to the scale\\nfactor. This nonlinearity allows us to describe both dust-dominated and\\naccelerating universes, though only in extremal cases. We obtain solutions of\\nthe non-linear field equations which are new and interesting. We have adopted a\\nfirst-order approximation of the key equation, which enabled us to derive an\\nexact, time-dependent solution for the scale factor. The higher dimensional\\ncosmological model is found to converge to a $\\\\Lambda$CDM model for a\\nlarge-scale factor, capturing the desired feature of an acceleration flip. We\\nalso explore the evolution of the deceleration parameter, effective EoS, jerk\\nparameter, etc., both analytically and graphically. The Chaplygin gas parameter\\n$\\\\alpha$ being significantly less than unity, apparently the present model does\\nnot support pure Chaplygin gas model ($\\\\alpha = 1$). However, the lower value\\nis consistent with our analysis, suggesting that smaller values of $\\\\alpha$ are\\nexpected at the later stage of the universe.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:53:24Z\"}"}
