They are believed to be formed from gas\\npolluted by the first generation of stars after the Big Bang and are important\\nobjects for studying the early universe, galaxy evolution, and nucleosynthesis.\\nDue to their rarity, the search for metal-poor stars and CEMP stars is a\\nvaluable task. This study investigates the search for CEMP stars based on the\\nlow-resolution stellar spectra from LAMOST DR8, and proposes a deep learning\\nscheme. From the LAMOST DR8 spectral library, this work discovered 12,766 CEMP\\nstar candidates. For ease of reference and use, we provide the estimated\\nparameters $T_\\\\texttt{eff}$, $\\\\log~g$, [Fe/H] and [C/H] for them.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T07:56:33Z\"}"}
