The problem aims\\nto answer two questions: \\\"How durable should a satellite be?\\\" and \\\"How much\\npropellant should be loaded into the satellite at launch?\\\" We formulate the\\nproblem as a mathematical optimization by adopting the design lifetime and\\npropellant mass as design variables and considering two objective functions to\\nbalance the returns and risks. A surrogate model-based framework, grounded in a\\nsatellite lifecycle simulation, is developed to address this problem. The\\ndeveloped framework considers various uncertainties and operational flexibility\\nand integrates a modified satellite sizing and cost model by adjusting\\ntraditional models with OOR. A design case study of a geosynchronous equatorial\\norbit communication satellite considering the OOR highlights the effectiveness\\nof the developed framework.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T04:07:58Z\"}"}
