{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00416v1\", \"title\": \"ScaleTrack: Scaling and back-tracking Automated GUI Agents\", \"summary\": \"Automated GUI agents aims to facilitate user interaction by automatically\\nperforming complex tasks in digital environments, such as web, mobile, desktop\\ndevices. It receives textual task instruction and GUI description to generate\\nexecutable actions (\\\\emph{e.g.}, click) and operation boxes step by step.\\nTraining a GUI agent mainly involves grounding and planning stages, in which\\nthe GUI grounding focuses on finding the execution coordinates according to the\\ntask, while the planning stage aims to predict the next action based on\\nhistorical actions. However, previous work suffers from the limitations of\\ninsufficient training data for GUI grounding, as well as the ignorance of\\nbacktracking historical behaviors for GUI planning. To handle the above\\nchallenges, we propose ScaleTrack, a training framework by scaling grounding\\nand backtracking planning for automated GUI agents. We carefully collected GUI\\nsamples of different synthesis criterions from a wide range of sources, and\\nunified them into the same template for training GUI grounding models.\\nMoreover, we design a novel training strategy that predicts the next action\\nfrom the current GUI image, while also backtracking the historical actions that\\nled to the GUI image. In this way, ScaleTrack explains the correspondence\\nbetween GUI images and actions, which effectively describes the evolution rules\\nof the GUI environment. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the\\neffectiveness of ScaleTrack. Data and code will be available at url.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T09:27:13Z\"}"}
