However, existing NeRV-based methods do not fully exploit\\ntemporal redundancy, as they rely on uniform sampling along the temporal axis,\\nleading to suboptimal rate-distortion (RD) performance. To address this\\nlimitation, we propose Tree-NeRV, a novel tree-structured feature\\nrepresentation for efficient and adaptive video encoding. Unlike conventional\\napproaches, Tree-NeRV organizes feature representations within a Binary Search\\nTree (BST), enabling non-uniform sampling along the temporal axis.\\nAdditionally, we introduce an optimization-driven sampling strategy,\\ndynamically allocating higher sampling density to regions with greater temporal\\nvariation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Tree-NeRV achieves superior\\ncompression efficiency and reconstruction quality, outperforming prior uniform\\nsampling-based methods. Code will be released.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T12:40:33Z\"}"}
