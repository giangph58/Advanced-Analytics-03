{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19509v1\", \"title\": \"Spatially Resolved Star Formation Rate and Dust Attenuation of Nearby\\n  Galaxies from CALIFA, GALEX, and WISE Data\", \"summary\": \"We study star formation rate (SFR) indicators and dust attenuation of 74\\nnearby star-forming galaxies on kiloparsec scales, based on GALEX\\nfar-ultraviolet (FUV) and WISE mid-infrared (MIR) images with CALIFA optical\\nintegral field spectroscopic data. We obtain hybrid SFR indicators by combining\\nthe observed FUV and MIR luminosities and calibrate them using the\\ndust-corrected H$\\\\alpha$ luminosity as a reference SFR. The simple linear\\ncombination appears to follow well the reference SFR, but the calibration\\nresidual shows a significant dependence on the specific SFR (sSFR), which can\\nbe removed by employing the combination coefficient or conversion offset that\\nvaries with the sSFR. In the plane of gas versus stellar attenuation, the\\nmedian trend line's slope ($\\\\approx$ stellar-to-gas attenuation ratio) changes\\nfrom 0.44 to 1.0 with increasing attenuation. The differential attenuation,\\ndefined as the deviation of stellar attenuation from the median trend line, is\\nstrongly correlated with the SFR surface density and sSFR, compatible with the\\ntwo-component dust model. The differential attenuation seems to be affected by\\nboth local and global factors.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T06:17:50Z\"}"}
