We classify the derived category of\\nprismatic crystals on the absolute prismatic site of $Y$ by studying\\nquasi-coherent complexes on the prismatization of $Y$ via $q$-prism charts. We\\nalso develop a Galois descent mechanism to remove the assumption on\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}_K$. As an application, we classify quasi-coherent complexes on the\\nCartier-Witt stack and give a purely algebraic calculation of the cohomology of\\nthe structure sheaf on the absolute prismatic site of $\\\\mathbb{Z}_p$. Along the\\nway, for $Y$ a locally complete intersection over $\\\\overline{A}$ with $A$ lying\\nover a $q$-prism, we classify quasi-coherent complexes on the relative\\nprismatization of $Y$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG,math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T16:24:51Z\"}"}
