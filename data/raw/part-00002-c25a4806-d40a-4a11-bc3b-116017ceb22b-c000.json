{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12191v1\", \"title\": \"Spin stiffnesses and stability of magnetic order in the lightly doped\\n  two-dimensional Hubbard model\", \"summary\": \"We analyze the density dependence of the spin stiffnesses and the stability\\nof magnetic order with respect to quantum fluctuations in the two-dimensional\\nHubbard model close to half-filling. The stiffnesses are computed from the spin\\nsusceptibility obtained from a random phase approximation in a magnetically\\nordered state. For a sizable next-to-nearest neighbor hopping amplitude and a\\nmoderate Hubbard interaction, the mean-field ground state is a N\\\\'eel\\nantiferromagnet in the electron doped regime at and above half-filling, and a\\nplanar circular spiral state in the hole doped regime below half-filling. Upon\\nelectron doping, the N\\\\'eel stiffness decreases smoothly and not very steeply.\\nBy contrast, the in-plane and out-of-plane stiffnesses in the spiral state drop\\nabruptly at half-filling. The out-of-plane stiffness even drops to zero, and\\nthen increases again very slowly upon increasing hole doping. At finite\\ntemperatures, the N\\\\'eel-to-spiral transition is shifted into the hole doped\\nregime, the stiffnesses are continuous functions of the density, and they\\nvanish at the transition. For small hole doping, the spin stiffnesses describe\\nthe quantum fluctuations only in a small momentum range, which shrinks to zero\\nupon approaching half-filling. Using the above results, we show that the\\nquantum ground state of the lightly electron doped Hubbard model remains N\\\\'eel\\nordered, while quantum fluctuations probably destroy the spiral long-range\\norder in the hole doped regime, giving rise to a quantum disordered state with\\na spin gap.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T15:45:20Z\"}"}
