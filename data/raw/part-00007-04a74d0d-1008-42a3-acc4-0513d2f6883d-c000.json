Previous studies on range decreasing group\\nhomomorphisms have primarily focused on specific subsets of mapping groups. In\\nthis paper, we provide a characterization of a general range decreasing group\\nhomomorphism applicable to the entire mapping group. As applications, we\\ncompute a particular class of homomorphisms between mapping groups and identify\\nall range decreasing group homomorphisms defined on specific mapping groups.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GR\", \"categories\": \"math.GR,math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T11:44:36Z\"}"}
