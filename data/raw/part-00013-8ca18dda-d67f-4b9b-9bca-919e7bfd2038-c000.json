{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04915v1\", \"title\": \"GlyphMastero: A Glyph Encoder for High-Fidelity Scene Text Editing\", \"summary\": \"Scene text editing, a subfield of image editing, requires modifying texts in\\nimages while preserving style consistency and visual coherence with the\\nsurrounding environment. While diffusion-based methods have shown promise in\\ntext generation, they still struggle to produce high-quality results. These\\nmethods often generate distorted or unrecognizable characters, particularly\\nwhen dealing with complex characters like Chinese. In such systems, characters\\nare composed of intricate stroke patterns and spatial relationships that must\\nbe precisely maintained. We present GlyphMastero, a specialized glyph encoder\\ndesigned to guide the latent diffusion model for generating texts with\\nstroke-level precision. Our key insight is that existing methods, despite using\\npretrained OCR models for feature extraction, fail to capture the hierarchical\\nnature of text structures - from individual strokes to stroke-level\\ninteractions to overall character-level structure. To address this, our glyph\\nencoder explicitly models and captures the cross-level interactions between\\nlocal-level individual characters and global-level text lines through our novel\\nglyph attention module. Meanwhile, our model implements a feature pyramid\\nnetwork to fuse the multi-scale OCR backbone features at the global-level.\\nThrough these cross-level and multi-scale fusions, we obtain more detailed\\nglyph-aware guidance, enabling precise control over the scene text generation\\nprocess. Our method achieves an 18.02\\\\% improvement in sentence accuracy over\\nthe state-of-the-art multi-lingual scene text editing baseline, while\\nsimultaneously reducing the text-region Fr\\\\'echet inception distance by\\n53.28\\\\%.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T03:11:58Z\"}"}
