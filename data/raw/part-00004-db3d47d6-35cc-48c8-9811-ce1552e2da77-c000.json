{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02805v1\", \"title\": \"The M31-M33 Interaction: Impact on M31's Center of Mass Motion and\\n  Satellite Orbits\", \"summary\": \"Inspired by recent studies of the Milky Way--LMC interaction and its\\nimplications for the Milky Way's global dynamical history, we investigate how\\nthe massive satellite galaxy M33 influences Andromeda's (M31) center of mass\\n(COM) position and velocity as it passes through M31's halo. Using recent\\n6-dimensional phase space measurements for both galaxies, we use backward\\nintegration to revisit M33's orbital history in a massive M31 potential\\n($3\\\\times10^{12}\\\\,M_{\\\\odot}$) for the first time. As previously concluded, we\\nfind that a first infall orbit is still the most statistically significant\\n($\\\\gtrsim$ 90%) orbital solution for M33, except for a high mass M31 combined\\nwith M31 proper motions from HST (as opposed to Gaia), where there is a greater\\nlikelihood (~65%) of a previous encounter. However, the minimum distance\\nbetween M33 and M31 during this passage is typically $\\\\geq$ 100 kpc, two to\\nthree times larger than the distance required to explain M33's warped stellar\\nand gaseous disks. We quantify the magnitude and direction of M31's evolving\\nCOM position ($R_{COM}$) and velocity ($V_{COM}$) owing to M33, finding\\n$R_{COM}\\\\approx$100-150 kpc at maximum and $V_{COM}\\\\approx$20-40 km s$^{-1}$.\\nFurthermore, we explore the implications of this phenomenon for the M31\\nsatellite system, specifically whether M33's gravitational influence is linked\\nto the lopsided distribution of M31 satellites and whether M33 significantly\\nperturbs the orbits of other M31 satellites. While M33 alone may not explain\\nthe lopsided nature of M31's satellite system, its dynamical impact is\\nnon-negligible and must be accounted for in future dynamical studies of the M31\\nsystem.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T17:51:15Z\"}"}
