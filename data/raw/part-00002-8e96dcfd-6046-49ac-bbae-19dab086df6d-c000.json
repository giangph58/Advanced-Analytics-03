These solar spectra\\nwere obtained in full Stokes polarimetry (I, Q/I, U/I, V/I) in the quiet Sun at\\nvarious distances from the limb, and at disk centre for comparison, with the\\nground based CNRS THEMIS telescope. Polarization rates Q/I up to 7% are\\nobtained in CaI 4227 {\\\\AA} line at $\\\\mu$ = cos$\\\\theta$ = 0, while 2% is reached\\nin SrI 4607 {\\\\AA} line and 1.4% in BaII 4554 {\\\\AA}. The spectra shown here are\\nfreely available in FITS format to the research community.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:45:27Z\"}"}
