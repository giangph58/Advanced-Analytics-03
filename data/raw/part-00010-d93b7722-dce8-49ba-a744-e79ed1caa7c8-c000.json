We\\nthen introduce a new approach for studying D-spaces and covering properties in\\ngeneral. We start by defining a topology on the family of all principal\\nultrafilters of a set $X$ called the principal ultrafilter topology. We show\\nthat each open neighborhood assignment could be transformed uniquely to a\\nspecial continuous map using the principal ultrafilter topology. We study some\\nstructures related to this special continuous map in the category Top, then we\\nobtain a characterization of D-spaces via this map. Finally, we prove some\\nresults on Lindel\\\\\\\"of, paracompact, and metacompact spaces that are related to\\nthe property D.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GN\", \"categories\": \"math.GN\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T17:35:51Z\"}"}
