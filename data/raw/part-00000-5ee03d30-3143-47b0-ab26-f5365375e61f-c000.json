{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24086v1\", \"title\": \"Distributed AC Optimal Power Flow: A Scalable Solution for Large-Scale\\n  Problems\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces a novel distributed optimization framework for\\nlarge-scale AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems, offering both theoretical\\nconvergence guarantees and rapid convergence in practice. By integrating\\nsmoothing techniques and the Schur complement, the proposed approach addresses\\nthe scalability challenges and reduces communication overhead in distributed AC\\nOPF. Additionally, optimal network decomposition enables efficient parallel\\nprocessing under the single program multiple data (SPMD) paradigm. Extensive\\nsimulations on large-scale benchmarks across various operating scenarios\\nindicate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art\\ncentralized solver IPOPT on modest hardware. This paves the way for more\\nscalable and efficient distributed optimization in future power system\\napplications.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:40:12Z\"}"}
