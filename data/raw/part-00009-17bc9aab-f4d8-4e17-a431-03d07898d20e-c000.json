This explains the ``coincidence'' that\\nno counterexample is known to Grabowski and Mathieu's long-standing conjecture\\ndespite the folklore that the conservation of local charges of order higher\\nthan 4 imposes additional constraints not implied by the conservation of the\\nthree-local charge.\", \"main_category\": \"math-ph\", \"categories\": \"math-ph,cond-mat.stat-mech,hep-th,math.MP,nlin.SI,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T17:48:03Z\"}"}
