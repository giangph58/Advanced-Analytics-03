While\\nnumerous extensions beyond image and video generation exist, few of such\\napproaches address the issue of explicit constraints in the samples generated.\\nIn this paper, we study the problem of generating paths in a layered graph (a\\nvariant of a directed acyclic graph) using discrete diffusion models, while\\nguaranteeing that our generated samples are indeed paths. Our approach utilizes\\na simple yet effective representation for paths which we call the padded\\nadjacency-list matrix (PALM). In addition, we show how to effectively perform\\nclassifier guidance, which helps steer the sampled paths to specific preferred\\nedges without any retraining of the diffusion model. Our preliminary results\\nshow that empirically, our method outperforms alternatives which do not\\nexplicitly account for path constraints.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:34:17Z\"}"}
