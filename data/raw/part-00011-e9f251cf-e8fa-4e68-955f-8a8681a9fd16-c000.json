Synchronization requires driven constituents, and in\\nsuch systems, the coupling can be designed to be nonreciprocal.\\nNonreciprocally-coupled oscillators exhibit a rich variety of behavior\\nincluding active traveling-wave type states. In this work, we study the\\ninterplay of three competing synchronization mechanisms in a setup of two\\nnonreciprocally-coupled quantum van der Pol oscillators. One of the oscillators\\nis driven externally which induces phase locking. A dissipative interaction\\nleads to anti-phase locking, whereas a coherent interaction nurtures bistable\\nphase locking and active states. We approximate the phase diagram of the\\nquantum case by evaluating the synchronization measure of a perturbation\\nexpansion of the steady state. Furthermore, we study the phase diagrams of two\\nand three oscillators in the mean-field limit and find highly nontrivial active\\nstates.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,nlin.PS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T16:29:32Z\"}"}
