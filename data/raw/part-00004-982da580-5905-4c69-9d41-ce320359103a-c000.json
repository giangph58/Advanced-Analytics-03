We introduce an alternative approach\\nto solving advection equations, specifically in an application to solving the\\nsix-dimensional Vlasov equation for modelling space plasmas. Communicating\\nlarger ghost domains around the partition assigned to each MPI task and\\ncomputing on these ghost cells allows for coalescing several discrete\\ncommunication calls into one. This approach needs more overall data\\ncommunication and computation, but provides interesting new avenues for the\\nbalancing of computational load between MPI tasks. We discuss this trade-off,\\nhow it may assist in developing other algorithmic improvements, and how the\\ntransition to heterogeneous CPU-GPU architectures may impact its usefulness.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.comp-ph,physics.plasm-ph,physics.space-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T09:13:44Z\"}"}
