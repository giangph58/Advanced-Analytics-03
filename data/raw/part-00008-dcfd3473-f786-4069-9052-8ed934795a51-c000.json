{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04528v1\", \"title\": \"Beyond Theorem Proving: Formulation, Framework and Benchmark for Formal\\n  Problem-Solving\", \"summary\": \"As a seemingly self-explanatory task, problem-solving has been a significant\\ncomponent of science and engineering. However, a general yet concrete\\nformulation of problem-solving itself is missing. With the recent development\\nof AI-based problem-solving agents, the demand for process-level verifiability\\nis rapidly increasing yet underexplored. To fill these gaps, we present a\\nprincipled formulation of problem-solving as a deterministic Markov decision\\nprocess; a novel framework, FPS (Formal Problem-Solving), which utilizes\\nexisting FTP (formal theorem proving) environments to perform process-verified\\nproblem-solving; and D-FPS (Deductive FPS), decoupling solving and answer\\nverification for better human-alignment. The expressiveness, soundness and\\ncompleteness of the frameworks are proven. We construct three benchmarks on\\nproblem-solving: FormalMath500, a formalization of a subset of the MATH500\\nbenchmark; MiniF2F-Solving and PutnamBench-Solving, adaptations of FTP\\nbenchmarks MiniF2F and PutnamBench. For faithful, interpretable, and\\nhuman-aligned evaluation, we propose RPE (Restricted Propositional\\nEquivalence), a symbolic approach to determine the correctness of answers by\\nformal verification. We evaluate four prevalent FTP models and two prompting\\nmethods as baselines, solving at most 23.77% of FormalMath500, 27.47% of\\nMiniF2F-Solving, and 0.31% of PutnamBench-Solving.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.CL,cs.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T16:02:14Z\"}"}
