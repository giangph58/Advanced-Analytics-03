{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17408v1\", \"title\": \"Introducing Combined Effects of Filtering and ASE Noise in Optical Links\\n  Supposing Different Equalization Algorithms\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents a comprehensive analytical framework for evaluating\\nfiltering penalties in ASE-noise-limited coherent optical links. The model\\naccounts for the cumulative effects of cascaded optical filters,\\namplifier-induced ASE noise, and transceiver noise, alongside digital\\nequalization at the receiver. By developing a generalized channel\\nrepresentation, we derive closed-form expressions for signal-to-noise ratio\\ndegradation under various equalization strategies, including Zero-Forcing\\nEqualizer, Minimum Mean Square Error Equalizer, and Fractionally Spaced\\nEqualizer. These models capture the impact of colored noise resulting from\\nlinear filtering and provide both time and frequency-domain insights. The\\nproposed framework is validated through experimental comparisons using\\naccurately modeled optical filters, demonstrating close agreement between\\ntheory and practice and offering a robust foundation for system-level\\nperformance evaluation in metro-access networks.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T10:01:02Z\"}"}
