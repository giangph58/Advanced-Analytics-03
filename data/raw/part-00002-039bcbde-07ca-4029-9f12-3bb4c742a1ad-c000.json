{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12992v1\", \"title\": \"Enhancing Cocoa Pod Disease Classification via Transfer Learning and\\n  Ensemble Methods: Toward Robust Predictive Modeling\", \"summary\": \"This study presents an ensemble-based approach for cocoa pod disease\\nclassification by integrating transfer learning with three ensemble learning\\nstrategies: Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking. Pre-trained convolutional neural\\nnetworks, including VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, ResNet101, InceptionV3, and\\nXception, were fine-tuned and employed as base learners to detect three disease\\ncategories: Black Pod Rot, Pod Borer, and Healthy. A balanced dataset of 6,000\\ncocoa pod images was curated and augmented to ensure robustness against\\nvariations in lighting, orientation, and disease severity. The performance of\\neach ensemble method was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and\\nF1-score. Experimental results show that Bagging consistently achieved superior\\nclassification performance with a test accuracy of 100%, outperforming Boosting\\n(97%) and Stacking (92%). The findings confirm that combining transfer learning\\nwith ensemble techniques improves model generalization and reliability, making\\nit a promising direction for precision agriculture and automated crop disease\\nmanagement.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T15:02:27Z\"}"}
