However, utilizing a fixed transmission rate in\\nenvironments with dynamic signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) often results in\\ninefficient use of communication resources. To address this challenge, this\\nletter proposes an importance-aware rate control semantic communication (IRCSC)\\nscheme, which dynamically adjusts transmission rates in response to both\\nchannel conditions and semantic importance. The scheme employs a\\ncontribution-based importance analyzer to rank semantic importance.\\nAdditionaly, a novel metric, the semantic transmission integrity index (STII),\\nis proposed to quantify the amount of correctly transmitted information and to\\ncorrelate it with inference performance. Simulations indicate that, with low\\ncomputational complexity, IRCSC guarantees a controllable trade-off between\\nperformance and rate, delivering higher compression efficiency and improved\\ntask performance in high-SNR scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T05:32:18Z\"}"}
