As AI's influence grows, it is essential for physicists\\n$\\\\unicode{x2013}$ as both researchers and informed citizens $\\\\unicode{x2013}$\\nto critically examine its foundations, misconceptions, and impact. This paper\\nexplores AI definitions, examines how ML differs from traditional programming,\\nand provides a brief review of AI/ML applications in HEP, highlighting\\npromising trends such as Simulation-Based Inference, uncertainty-aware machine\\nlearning, and Fast ML for anomaly detection. Beyond physics, it also addresses\\nthe broader societal harms of AI systems, underscoring the need for responsible\\nengagement. Finally, it stresses the importance of adapting research practices\\nto an evolving AI landscape, ensuring that physicists not only benefit from the\\nlatest tools but also remain at the forefront of innovation.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph,cs.LG,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:35:43Z\"}"}
