We show that this flexibility leads to a considerable\\nreduction in the error probability compared to a fixed number of reads, not\\nonly in terms of constants in the error exponent but also in the scaling laws.\\nThis is shown via an achievability result for a suitably-designed protocol, and\\nin certain parameter regimes we additionally establish a matching converse that\\nholds for all protocols within a broader concatenated coding based class.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T07:56:21Z\"}"}
