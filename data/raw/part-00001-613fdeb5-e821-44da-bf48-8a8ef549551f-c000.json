{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06615v1\", \"title\": \"Reliability Assessment of Low-Cost PM Sensors under High Humidity and\\n  High PM Level Outdoor Conditions\", \"summary\": \"Low-cost particulate matter (PM) sensors have become increasingly popular due\\nto their compact size, low power consumption, and cost-effective installation\\nand maintenance. While several studies have explored the effects of\\nmeteorological conditions and pollution exposure on low-cost sensor (LCS)\\nperformance, few have addressed the combined impact of high PM concentration\\nand high humidity levels. In contrast to most evaluation studies, which\\ngenerally report $\\\\text{PM}_{2.5}$ levels below $150~\\\\mu\\\\text{g/m}^3$, our\\nstudy observed hourly average $\\\\text{PM}_{2.5}$ concentrations ranging from\\n$6-611~\\\\mu\\\\text{g/m}^3$ (mean value of $137~\\\\mu\\\\text{g/m}^3$), with relative\\nhumidity between $25-95\\\\%$ (mean value of $72\\\\%$), and temperature varying from\\n$6-29^\\\\circ$C (mean value of $16^\\\\circ$C). We evaluate three LCS models (SPS30,\\nPMS7003, HPMA115C0-004) in outdoor conditions during the winter season in New\\nDelhi, India, deployed alongside a reference-grade beta attenuation monitor\\n(BAM). The results indicate a strong correlation between LCS and BAM\\nmeasurements (${R^2} > 90\\\\%$). The RMSE increases with increasing PM\\nconcentration and humidity levels but the narrow $95\\\\%$ confidence interval\\nrange of LCS as a function of the reference BAM suggests the importance of LCS\\nin air pollution monitoring. Among the evaluated LCS models, SPS30 showed the\\nhighest overall accuracy. Overall, the study demonstrates that LCS can\\neffectively monitor air quality in regions with high PM and high humidity\\nlevels, provided appropriate correction models are applied.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T06:21:24Z\"}"}
