{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05657v1\", \"title\": \"Nes2Net: A Lightweight Nested Architecture for Foundation Model Driven\\n  Speech Anti-spoofing\", \"summary\": \"Speech foundation models have significantly advanced various speech-related\\ntasks by providing exceptional representation capabilities. However, their\\nhigh-dimensional output features often create a mismatch with downstream task\\nmodels, which typically require lower-dimensional inputs. A common solution is\\nto apply a dimensionality reduction (DR) layer, but this approach increases\\nparameter overhead, computational costs, and risks losing valuable information.\\nTo address these issues, we propose Nested Res2Net (Nes2Net), a lightweight\\nback-end architecture designed to directly process high-dimensional features\\nwithout DR layers. The nested structure enhances multi-scale feature\\nextraction, improves feature interaction, and preserves high-dimensional\\ninformation. We first validate Nes2Net on CtrSVDD, a singing voice deepfake\\ndetection dataset, and report a 22% performance improvement and an 87% back-end\\ncomputational cost reduction over the state-of-the-art baseline. Additionally,\\nextensive testing across four diverse datasets: ASVspoof 2021, ASVspoof 5,\\nPartialSpoof, and In-the-Wild, covering fully spoofed speech, adversarial\\nattacks, partial spoofing, and real-world scenarios, consistently highlights\\nNes2Net's superior robustness and generalization capabilities. The code package\\nand pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/Liu-Tianchi/Nes2Net.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.AS\", \"categories\": \"eess.AS,cs.AI,cs.SD\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T04:11:28Z\"}"}
