This is a sequel of the known\\n$SO(D)$ gauged $O(D+1)$ Skyrmions on $\\\\mathbb{R}^D$ in $D=2$ and in $D=3$, with\\nboth of which its properties are compared. Two families of solutions are found,\\nof these only one possessing a gauge decoupling limit. The curvatures of both\\nof these solutions decay as $r^{-3}$, are bounded below by the topological\\ncharge, and are localised to an absolute scale. As such, they may have the\\npotential of being interpreted as instantons.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T16:28:10Z\"}"}
