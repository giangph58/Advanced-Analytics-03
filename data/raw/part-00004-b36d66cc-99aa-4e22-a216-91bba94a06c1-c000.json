{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20848v1\", \"title\": \"Mitigating the Structural Bias in Graph Adversarial Defenses\", \"summary\": \"In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great potential in\\naddressing various graph structure-related downstream tasks. However, recent\\nstudies have found that current GNNs are susceptible to malicious adversarial\\nattacks. Given the inevitable presence of adversarial attacks in the real\\nworld, a variety of defense methods have been proposed to counter these attacks\\nand enhance the robustness of GNNs. Despite the commendable performance of\\nthese defense methods, we have observed that they tend to exhibit a structural\\nbias in terms of their defense capability on nodes with low degree (i.e., tail\\nnodes), which is similar to the structural bias of traditional GNNs on nodes\\nwith low degree in the clean graph. Therefore, in this work, we propose a\\ndefense strategy by including hetero-homo augmented graph construction, $k$NN\\naugmented graph construction, and multi-view node-wise attention modules to\\nmitigate the structural bias of GNNs against adversarial attacks. Notably, the\\nhetero-homo augmented graph consists of removing heterophilic links (i.e.,\\nlinks connecting nodes with dissimilar features) globally and adding homophilic\\nlinks (i.e., links connecting nodes with similar features) for nodes with low\\ndegree. To further enhance the defense capability, an attention mechanism is\\nadopted to adaptively combine the representations from the above two kinds of\\ngraph views. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the defense and\\ndebiasing effect of the proposed strategy on benchmark datasets.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T15:19:05Z\"}"}
