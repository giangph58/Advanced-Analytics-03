{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04294v1\", \"title\": \"Massive MIMO: Instantaneous versus Statistical CSI-Based Power\\n  Allocation\", \"summary\": \"The deployment of instantaneous CSI-based power control schemes necessitates\\ncomputationally intensive signal processing operations, requiring substantial\\nresources to handle real-time CSI updates and the associated overhead.\\nConversely, statistical CSIbased schemes enable efficient implementation of\\nadvanced power allocation algorithms within large-scale massive MIMO (mMIMO)\\nsystems, where the algorithms are updated much less frequently. Nevertheless,\\nthese schemes may deviate from optimal results in certain practical mMIMO\\nconfigurations, necessitating the adoption of instantaneous CSI-based schemes.\\nIn addition, they may be limited in practical implementation where\\ninstantaneous CSI-based resource allocation and management schemes are widely\\nadopted. This lecture provides a comprehensive comparison between the\\nstatistical CSI-based power allocation and instantaneous CSI-based power\\nallocation designs for mMIMO systems from performance, complexity, and\\npractical implementation aspects.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T10:05:23Z\"}"}
