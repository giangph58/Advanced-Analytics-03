{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00443v1\", \"title\": \"Distributed Retrieval-Augmented Generation\", \"summary\": \"As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly adopted on edge devices,\\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is gaining prominence as a solution to\\naddress factual deficiencies and hallucinations by integrating external\\nknowledge. However, centralized RAG architectures face significant challenges\\nin data privacy and scalability. For instance, smart healthcare services often\\nrely on collecting sensitive patient data and building a centralized knowledge\\nbase to provide better diagnosis and treatment advice, while privacy concerns\\nsignificantly impede this process. Besides, maintaining a comprehensive and\\ncontinuously updated knowledge base is costly, particularly in response to\\nregional epidemics and rapidly mutating viruses. To address these challenges,\\nthis paper introduces Distributed Retrieval-Augmented Generation (DRAG), a\\nnovel framework that improves data privacy by eliminating the need for a\\ncentralized knowledge base and restoring data control to owners. DRAG\\nincorporates a Topic-Aware Random Walk (TARW) algorithm that leverages LLMs to\\nextract query topics and facilitate targeted peer discovery within a\\npeer-to-peer network, enabling efficient knowledge retrieval in decentralized\\nenvironments. Extensive experiments across three diverse datasets and LLMs\\ndemonstrate that DRAG with TARW achieves near-centralized RAG performance by\\nusing half as many messages as flooding.
