{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15574v1\", \"title\": \"Vielbein Lattice Boltzmann approach for fluid flows on spherical\\n  surfaces\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we develop a lattice Boltzmann scheme based on the vielbein\\nformalism for the study of fluid flows on spherical surfaces. The vielbein\\nvector field encodes all details related to the geometry of the underlying\\nspherical surface, allowing the velocity space to be treated as on the\\nCartesian space. The resulting Boltzmann equation exhibits inertial (geometric)\\nforces, that ensure that fluid particles follow paths that remain on the\\nspherical manifold, which we compute by projection onto the space of Hermite\\npolynomials.\\n  Due to the point-dependent nature of the advection velocity in the polar\\ncoordinate $\\\\theta$, exact streaming is not feasible, and we instead employ\\nfinite-difference schemes. We provide a detailed formulation of the lattice\\nBoltzmann algorithm, with particular attention to boundary conditions at the\\nnorth and south poles.\\n  We validate our numerical implementation against two analytical solutions of\\nthe Navier-Stokes equations derived in this work: the propagation of sound and\\nshear waves. Additionally, we assess the robustness of the scheme by simulating\\nthe compressible flow of an axisymmetric shockwave and analyzing vortex\\ndynamics on the spherical surface.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn,math-ph,math.MP,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T04:19:11Z\"}"}
