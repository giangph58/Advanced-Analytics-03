{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04919v1\", \"title\": \"Distorted Sounds: Unlocking the Physics of Modern Music\", \"summary\": \"In the production of modern music, the musical characteristics of the guitar\\nor keyboard amplifier play an integral role in the creative process. This\\narticle explores the physics of music with an emphasis on the role of\\ndistortion in the amplification. In particular, we derive and illustrate how a\\ndistorted amplifier creates new musical notes that are not played by the\\nmusician, greatly simplifying the playing technique. In providing a\\ncomprehensive understanding, we commence with a discussion of the physics of\\nmusic, highlighting the harmonic series and its relation to pleasing harmonies.\\nThis is placed in the context of the standard music notation of intervals and\\ntheir relation to note frequency ratios. We then discuss the problems of tuning\\nan instrument and why the equal temperament of standard guitar tuners is\\nincompatible with good sounding music when amplifier distortion is involved.\\nDrawing on the basic trigonometric identities for angle sums and differences,\\nwe show how the nonlinear amplification of a distorted amplifier, generates new\\nnotes not played by the musician. Here the importance of setting your guitar\\ntuner aside and using your ear to tune is emphasised. We close with a\\ndiscussion of how humans decipher musical notes and why some highly distorted\\nguitar chords give the impression of low notes that are not actually there.\\nThis article will be of assistance to students interested in the physics of\\nmusic and lecturers seeking fascinating and relevant applications of\\nmathematical trigonometric relations and physics to capture the attention of\\ntheir students.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.pop-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.pop-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:01:46Z\"}"}
