{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16573v1\", \"title\": \"PsyCounAssist: A Full-Cycle AI-Powered Psychological Counseling\\n  Assistant System\", \"summary\": \"Psychological counseling is a highly personalized and dynamic process that\\nrequires therapists to continuously monitor emotional changes, document session\\ninsights, and maintain therapeutic continuity. In this paper, we introduce\\nPsyCounAssist, a comprehensive AI-powered counseling assistant system\\nspecifically designed to augment psychological counseling practices.\\nPsyCounAssist integrates multimodal emotion recognition combining speech and\\nphotoplethysmography (PPG) signals for accurate real-time affective analysis,\\nautomated structured session reporting using large language models (LLMs), and\\npersonalized AI-generated follow-up support. Deployed on Android-based tablet\\ndevices, the system demonstrates practical applicability and flexibility in\\nreal-world counseling scenarios. Experimental evaluation confirms the\\nreliability of PPG-based emotional classification and highlights the system's\\npotential for non-intrusive, privacy-aware emotional support. PsyCounAssist\\nrepresents a novel approach to ethically and effectively integrating AI into\\npsychological counseling workflows.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T09:49:05Z\"}"}
