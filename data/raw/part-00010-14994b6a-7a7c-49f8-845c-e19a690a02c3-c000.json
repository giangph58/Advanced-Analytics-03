I will explain some basics of the\\nrepresentation theory underlying Spin(10) and SU(5) Grand Unified Theories. I\\nwill also explain the characterisation of the Standard Model gauge group G_SM\\nas a subgroup of Spin(10) that was developed in [1]. Thus, the symmetry\\nbreaking required to obtain G_SM can be seen to rely on two suitably aligned\\ncommuting complex structures on R10. The required complex structures can in\\nturn be encoded in a pair of pure spinors of Spin(10). The condition that the\\ncomplex structures are commuting and suitably aligned translates into the\\nrequirement that the respective pure spinors are orthogonal and that their sum\\nis again a pure spinor. The most efficient description of spinors, and in\\nparticular pure spinors of Spin(10) is via the octonionic model of the latter,\\nand this is how octonions enter the story.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T07:23:58Z\"}"}
