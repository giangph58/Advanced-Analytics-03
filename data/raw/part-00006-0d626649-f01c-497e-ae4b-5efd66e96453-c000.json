{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04144v1\", \"title\": \"Independent mutual-visibility coloring and related concepts\", \"summary\": \"Given a graph $G$, a subset $M\\\\subseteq V(G)$ is a mutual-visibility (MV) set\\nif for every $u,v\\\\in M$, there exists a $u,v$-geodesic whose internal vertices\\nare not in $M$. We investigate proper vertex colorings of graphs whose color\\nclasses are mutual-visibility sets. The main concepts that arise in this\\ninvestigation are independent mutual-visibility (IMV) sets and vertex\\npartitions into these sets (IMV colorings). The IMV number $\\\\mu_{i}$ and the\\nIMV chromatic number $\\\\chi_{\\\\mu_{i}}$ are defined as maximum and minimum\\ncardinality taken over all IMV sets and IMV colorings, respectively. Along the\\nway, we also continue with the study of MV chromatic number $\\\\chi_{\\\\mu}$ (as\\nthe smallest number of sets in a vertex partition into MV sets), which was\\ninitiated in an earlier paper.\\n  We establish a close connection between the (I)MV chromatic numbers of\\nsubdivisions of complete graphs and Ramsey numbers $R(4^k;2)$. From the\\ncomputational point of view, we prove that the problems of computing\\n$\\\\chi_{\\\\mu_{i}}$ and $\\\\mu_{i}$ are NP-complete, and that it is NP-hard to\\ndecide whether a graph $G$ satisfies $\\\\imv(G)=\\\\alpha(G)$ where $\\\\alpha(G)$ is\\nthe independence number of $G$. Several tight bounds on $\\\\chi_{\\\\mu_{i}}$,\\n$\\\\chi_{\\\\mu}$ and $\\\\mu_{i}$ are given. Exact values/formulas for these\\nparameters in some classical families of graphs are proved. In particular, we\\nprove that $\\\\chi_{\\\\mu_{i}}(T)=\\\\chi_{\\\\mu}(T)$ holds for any tree $T$ of order at\\nleast $3$, and determine their exact formulas in the case of lexicographic\\nproduct graphs. Finally, we give tight bounds on the (I)MV chromatic numbers\\nfor the Cartesian and strong product graphs, which lead to exact values in some\\nimportant families of product graphs.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T05:49:27Z\"}"}
