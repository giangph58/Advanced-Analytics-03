The probing tip is included through a single tip apex atom, and\\nits electronic structure can be modeled as a linear combination of electron\\norbitals of various symmetries, or can be directly transferred from\\nfirst-principles electronic structure calculations. By taking pristine and\\nboron- or nitrogen-doped graphene sheets as sample surfaces, the reliability of\\nour implementation is demonstrated by comparing its results to those obtained\\nby the Tersoff-Hamann and Bardeen's electron tunneling models. It is\\nhighlighted that the energy-resolved direct and interference contributions to\\ndI/dV arising from the tip's electron orbitals result in a fingerprint of the\\nparticular combined surface-tip system. The significant difference between the\\nelectron acceptor boron and donor nitrogen dopants in graphene is reflected in\\ntheir dI/dV fingerprints. The presented theoretical method allows for an\\nunprecedented physical understanding of the electron tunneling process in terms\\nof tip-orbital-resolved energy-dependent dI/dV maps, that is anticipated to be\\nextremely useful for investigating the local electronic properties of novel\\nmaterial surfaces in the future.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:45:41Z\"}"}
