{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12807v1\", \"title\": \"Hybrid Dense-UNet201 Optimization for Pap Smear Image Segmentation Using\\n  Spider Monkey Optimization\", \"summary\": \"Pap smear image segmentation is crucial for cervical cancer diagnosis.\\nHowever, traditional segmentation models often struggle with complex cellular\\nstructures and variations in pap smear images. This study proposes a hybrid\\nDense-UNet201 optimization approach that integrates a pretrained DenseNet201 as\\nthe encoder for the U-Net architecture and optimizes it using the spider monkey\\noptimization (SMO) algorithm. The Dense-UNet201 model excelled at feature\\nextraction. The SMO was modified to handle categorical and discrete parameters.\\nThe SIPaKMeD dataset was used in this study and evaluated using key performance\\nmetrics, including loss, accuracy, Intersection over Union (IoU), and Dice\\ncoefficient. The experimental results showed that Dense-UNet201 outperformed\\nU-Net, Res-UNet50, and Efficient-UNetB0. SMO Dense-UNet201 achieved a\\nsegmentation accuracy of 96.16%, an IoU of 91.63%, and a Dice coefficient score\\nof 95.63%. These findings underscore the effectiveness of image preprocessing,\\npretrained models, and metaheuristic optimization in improving medical image\\nanalysis and provide new insights into cervical cell segmentation methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T10:14:05Z\"}"}
