{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06927v1\", \"title\": \"RO-FIGS: Efficient and Expressive Tree-Based Ensembles for Tabular Data\", \"summary\": \"Tree-based models are often robust to uninformative features and can\\naccurately capture non-smooth, complex decision boundaries. Consequently, they\\noften outperform neural network-based models on tabular datasets at a\\nsignificantly lower computational cost. Nevertheless, the capability of\\ntraditional tree-based ensembles to express complex relationships efficiently\\nis limited by using a single feature to make splits. To improve the efficiency\\nand expressiveness of tree-based methods, we propose Random Oblique Fast\\nInterpretable Greedy-Tree Sums (RO-FIGS). RO-FIGS builds on Fast Interpretable\\nGreedy-Tree Sums, and extends it by learning trees with oblique or multivariate\\nsplits, where each split consists of a linear combination learnt from random\\nsubsets of features. This helps uncover interactions between features and\\nimproves performance. The proposed method is suitable for tabular datasets with\\nboth numerical and categorical features. We evaluate RO-FIGS on 22 real-world\\ntabular datasets, demonstrating superior performance and much smaller models\\nover other tree- and neural network-based methods. Additionally, we analyse\\ntheir splits to reveal valuable insights into feature interactions, enriching\\nthe information learnt from SHAP summary plots, and thereby demonstrating the\\nenhanced interpretability of RO-FIGS models. The proposed method is well-suited\\nfor applications, where balance between accuracy and interpretability is\\nessential.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:35:24Z\"}"}
