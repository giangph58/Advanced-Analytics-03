This paper introduces a transformation-based method for exact synthesis\\nof reversible circuits. The proposed approach utilizes a modified\\nQuine-McCluskey algorithm to eliminate input-output discrepancies in the truth\\ntable, transforming the permutation matrix into an identity matrix.\\nFurthermore, a novel search space reduction technique is presented which,\\ncombined with the primary method, enables the synthesis algorithm to handle\\nhigh-input reversible functions. This approach combines the influence of\\nmultiple control qubits on a target qubit, evaluating their collective impact.\\nThis aggregation can decrease the control qubit count within quantum gates.\\nConsequently, it proves beneficial for applications like surface code error\\ncorrection architectures as well as current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum\\n(NISQ) hardwares. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements\\nover the state-of-the-art exact synthesis methods, achieving up to 99%\\nimprovements in terms of the number of levels of T-gates.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.ET,cs.PF\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:29:33Z\"}"}
