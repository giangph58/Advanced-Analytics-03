While we are not the first to consider this question, our treatment\\nis more general and more physical than those in the literature. Indeed, it\\napplies to a broad class of systems, including ones that possess mechanisms;\\nand we discuss how the degeneracy that plagues prior work in this area can be\\navoided by penalizing change of orientation. A key motivation for this work is\\nits relevance to mechanism-based mechanical metamaterials. Such systems often\\nhave ``soft modes'', achieved in typical examples by modulating mechanisms. Our\\nresults permit the following more general definition of a soft mode: it is a\\nmacroscopic deformation whose effective energy vanishes -- in other words, one\\nwhose spatially-averaged elastic energy tends to zero in the continuum limit.\", \"main_category\": \"math-ph\", \"categories\": \"math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T17:24:25Z\"}"}
