{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10965v1\", \"title\": \"Investigating the light curve variation of magnetic white dwarfs induced\\n  by the axion-photon conversion\", \"summary\": \"Axion-photon oscillation refers to the process of mutual conversion between\\nphotons and axions when they propagate in a magnetic field. This process\\ndepends on the strength of the background magnetic field, and magnetic white\\ndwarfs provide a natural laboratory for testing this process. In this work, we\\nstudy the behavior of axion-photon oscillation near magnetic white dwarfs: as\\nthe magnetic white dwarf rotates, its magnetic field structure rotates\\naccordingly, causing a periodic change of the magnetic field along the path of\\nphotons. These variations affect the axion-photon oscillation process\\nexperienced by the photons emitted from the white dwarf, thereby inducing a\\nperiodic modulation in the intensity and polarization of the white dwarf's\\nthermal emission that we observe. Our study focuses on the impact of axion\\neffects on the observed light curve variation and conducts a detailed\\ninvestigation through numerical calculations. Using the light curve data of the\\nwhite dwarf PG1015+014 obtained from the observations by the Jacobus Kapteyn\\nTelescope, which has a photometric precision of $\\\\sim1\\\\%$, we derive the\\nconstraints on axion parameters. In the axion mass range of\\n$\\\\lesssim10^{-8}\\\\,{\\\\rm eV}$, the 95\\\\% credible interval upper limit of the\\naxion-photon coupling $g_{a\\\\gamma\\\\gamma}$ is constrained to $<8.1 \\\\times\\n10^{-12} \\\\mathrm{GeV^{-1}}$.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T08:17:41Z\"}"}
