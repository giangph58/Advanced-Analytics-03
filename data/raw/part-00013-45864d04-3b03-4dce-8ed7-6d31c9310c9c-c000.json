We\\nhave systematically searched approximately 100 million image cutouts from the\\nentire Hubble Legacy Archive using the recently developed AnomalyMatch method,\\nwhich combines semi-supervised and active learning techniques for the efficient\\ndetection of astrophysical anomalies. This comprehensive search rapidly\\nuncovered a multitude of astrophysical anomalies presented here that\\nsignificantly expand the inventory of known rare objects. Among our discoveries\\nare 138 new candidate gravitational lenses, 18 jellyfish galaxies, and 417\\nmergers or interacting galaxes. The efficiency and accuracy of our iterative\\ndetection strategy allows us to trawl the complete archive within just 2-3\\ndays, highlighting its potential for large-scale astronomical surveys. We\\npresent a detailed overview of these newly identified objects, discuss their\\nastrophysical significance, and demonstrate the considerable potential of\\nAnomalyMatch to efficiently explore extensive astronomical datasets, e.g.,\\nupcoming Euclid data releases.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T13:19:14Z\"}"}
