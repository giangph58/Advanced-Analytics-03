Although chemical functionalization of alpha-quartz\\n(alpha-SiO2) with hydroxyl (OH) and methyl (CH3) groups has been extensively\\nstudied, the impact of their spatial distribution at the atomic scale remains\\nlargely uncharted. In this work, we integrate density functional theory (DFT),\\nab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), and on-the-fly machine-learned force\\nfields (MLFFs) to systematically investigate how different arrangements of\\nOH/CH3 groups modulate surface properties. Our results reveal that spatial\\npatterning governs the formation of hydrogen-bonding networks, alters\\nvibrational signatures, and has a significant influence on the thermodynamic\\nstability of the functionalized surfaces. The MLFF framework enables\\nhigh-fidelity simulations at unprecedented scales, bridging the gap between\\nquantum accuracy and statistical sampling. By uncovering structure-property\\nrelationships inaccessible to conventional approaches, this study establishes\\nspatial arrangement of functionalized groups as a critical and tunable design\\naxis, paving the way for the predictive engineering of silica-based materials\\nwith optimized interfacial performance.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T16:47:37Z\"}"}
