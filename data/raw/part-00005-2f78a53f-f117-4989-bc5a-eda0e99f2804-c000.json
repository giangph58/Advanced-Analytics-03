Quantifying the complexity of the\\nentanglement within these models enhances the characterisation of these\\nstructures. In this paper, we introduce a new measure of entanglement\\ncomplexity through the untangling number, reminiscent of the unknotting number\\nin knot theory. The untangling number quantifies the minimum distance between a\\ngiven 3-periodic structure and its least tangled version, called ground state,\\nthrough a sequence of operations in a diagrammatic representation of the\\nstructure. For entanglements that consist of only infinite open curves, we show\\nthat the generic ground states of these structures are crystallographic rod\\npackings, well-known in structural chemistry.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GT\", \"categories\": \"math.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T14:00:14Z\"}"}
