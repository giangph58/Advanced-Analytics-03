{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12658v1\", \"title\": \"Rare-Event-Induced Ergodicity Breaking in Logarithmic Aging Systems\", \"summary\": \"Ergodicity breaking and aging effects are fundamental challenges in\\nout-of-equilibrium systems. Various mechanisms have been proposed to understand\\nthe non-ergodic and aging phenomena, possibly related to observations in\\nsystems ranging from structural glass and Anderson glasses to biological\\nsystems and mechanical systems. While anomalous diffusion described by Levy\\nstatistics efficiently captures ergodicity breaking, the origin of aging and\\nergodicity breaking in systems with ultraslow dynamics remain unclear. Here, we\\nreport a novel mechanism of ergodicity breaking in systems exhibiting log-aging\\ndiffusion. This mechanism, characterized by increasingly infrequent rare events\\nwith aging, yields statistics deviating significantly from Levy distribution,\\nbreaking ergodicity as shown by unequal time- and ensemble-averaged mean\\nsquared displacements and two distinct asymptotic probability distribution\\nfunctions. Notably, although these rare events contribute negligibly to\\nstatistical averages, they dramatically change the system's characteristic\\ntime. This work lays the groundwork for microscopic understanding of\\nout-of-equilibrium systems and provides new perspectives on glasses and\\nGriffiths-McCoy singularities.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn,cond-mat.soft,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T05:37:07Z\"}"}
