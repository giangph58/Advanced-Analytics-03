{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00342v1\", \"title\": \"LLMPrism: Black-box Performance Diagnosis for Production LLM Training\\n  Platforms\", \"summary\": \"Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought about revolutionary changes in\\ndiverse fields, rendering LLM training of utmost importance for modern\\nenterprises. To meet this demand, multi-tenant large-scale LLM training\\nplatforms have been built to offer LLM training services. Nevertheless, due to\\nthe complexity and synchronous nature of LLM training process, performance\\nissues occur frequently and can result in substantial resource wastage. The\\nlimited visibility from the perspective of platform providers impedes existing\\nprofiling methods and poses challenges to the monitoring and diagnosis of the\\nperformance of LLM training jobs. For the first time, this paper proposes the\\nutilization of underlying network flow data to reconstruct the training\\ntimelines of jobs based on the distinct characteristics in the LLM training\\nprocedure. We design LLMPrism, the first black-box performance diagnosis system\\nfor LLM training platforms. By progressively recognizing LLM training jobs,\\nidentifying their parallelism strategies, and reconstructing the training\\ntimelines, LLMPrism achieves non-intrusive, lightweight, and continuous\\nmonitoring of LLM training systems. Leveraging this monitoring capability, it\\nfurther effectively diagnoses potential performance issues. Since Oct. 2024,\\nLLMPrism has been deployed on our large-scale production Platform-X, in which\\nthe evaluations and deployment experiences demonstrate that LLMPrism can\\nachieve accurate timeline reconstruction with an error within 0.3% and\\neffectively diagnose various performance issues.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T06:38:52Z\"}"}
