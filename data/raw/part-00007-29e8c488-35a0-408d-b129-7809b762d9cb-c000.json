{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00343v1\", \"title\": \"Compressing fluid flows with nonlinear machine learning: mode\\n  decomposition, latent modeling, and flow control\", \"summary\": \"An autoencoder is a self-supervised machine-learning network trained to\\noutput a quantity identical to the input. Owing to its structure possessing a\\nbottleneck with a lower dimension, an autoencoder works to achieve data\\ncompression, extracting the essence of the high-dimensional data into the\\nresulting latent space. We review the fundamentals of flow field compression\\nusing convolutional neural network-based autoencoder (CNN-AE) and its\\napplications to various fluid dynamics problems. We cover the structure and the\\nworking principle of CNN-AE with an example of unsteady flows while examining\\nthe theoretical similarities between linear and nonlinear compression\\ntechniques. Representative applications of CNN-AE to various flow problems,\\nsuch as mode decomposition, latent modeling, and flow control, are discussed.\\nThroughout the present review, we show how the outcomes from the nonlinear\\nmachine-learning-based compression may support modeling and understanding a\\nrange of fluid mechanics problems.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T06:39:35Z\"}"}
