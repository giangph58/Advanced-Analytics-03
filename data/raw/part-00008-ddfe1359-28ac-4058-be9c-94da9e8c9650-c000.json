It is well-known that classical methods, such as\\nthe finite volume method, suffer from the curse of dimensionality, and that\\ntheir time step is constrained by a stability condition. The semi-Lagrangian\\nmethod is known to overcome the stability issue, while recent time-discrete\\nneural network-based approaches overcome the curse of dimensionality. In this\\nwork, we propose a novel neural semi-Lagrangian method that combines these last\\ntwo approaches. It relies on projecting the initial condition onto a\\nfinite-dimensional neural space, and then solving an optimization problem,\\ninvolving the backwards characteristic equation, at each time step. It is\\nparticularly well-suited for implementation on GPUs, as it is fully\\nparallelizable and does not require a mesh. We provide rough error estimates,\\nand present several high-dimensional numerical experiments to assess the\\nperformance of our approach, and compare it to other neural methods.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T12:52:55Z\"}"}
