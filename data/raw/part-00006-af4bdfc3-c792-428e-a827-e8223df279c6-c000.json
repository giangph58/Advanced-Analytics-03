{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17298v1\", \"title\": \"Three new 2+2 quadruple systems with changing inclination\", \"summary\": \"We present a unique discovery of three new detected systems showing two\\ndifferent phenomena together. These are 2+2 quadruple stellar systems showing\\ntwo eclipsing binaries as the inner pairs. And besides that, these systems were\\nalso found to exhibit the precession of the inner orbits causing the\\ninclination changes manifesting themselves through the eclipse depth\\nvariations. We are not aware of any similar known system on the sky nowadays,\\nhence our discovery is really unique. In particular these systems are: CzeV4315\\n= HD 228777 (periods 6.7391 d and 0.91932 d, inclination change of pair B of\\nabout 1.4deg/yr); ASASSN-V J075203.23-323102.7 = GDS_J0752031-323102 (8.86916 d\\n+ 2.6817 d, inclination change of pair B of about 1.03deg/yr, now only\\nellipsoidal variations); ASASSN-V J105824.33-611347.6 = TIC 465899856 (2.3304 d\\n+ 13.0033 d, inclination change of pair B, now undetectable). These systems\\nprovide us unique insight into the quadruple-star dynamics, including the\\norbit-orbit interaction, Kozai-Lidov cycles, and testing the stellar formation\\ntheories of these higher order multiples.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T06:46:38Z\"}"}
