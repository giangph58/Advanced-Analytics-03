Existing\\nworks have explored the effects of V2V communication impairments on perception\\nprecision, but they lack generalization to different levels of impairments. In\\nthis work, we propose a joint weighting and denoising framework, Coop-WD, to\\nenhance cooperative perception subject to V2V channel impairments. In this\\nframework, the self-supervised contrastive model and the conditional diffusion\\nprobabilistic model are adopted hierarchically for vehicle-level and\\npixel-level feature enhancement. An efficient variant model, Coop-WD-eco, is\\nproposed to selectively deactivate denoising to reduce processing overhead.\\nRician fading, non-stationarity, and time-varying distortion are considered.\\nSimulation results demonstrate that the proposed Coop-WD outperforms\\nconventional benchmarks in all types of channels. Qualitative analysis with\\nvisual examples further proves the superiority of our proposed method. The\\nproposed Coop-WD-eco achieves up to 50% reduction in computational cost under\\nsevere distortion while maintaining comparable accuracy as channel conditions\\nimprove.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T13:38:35Z\"}"}
