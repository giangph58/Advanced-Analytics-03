These issues introduce challenges for imitation\\nlearning. To tackle these problems, we introduce CAFE-AD, a Cross-Scenario\\nAdaptive Feature Enhancement for Trajectory Planning in Autonomous Driving\\nmethod, designed to enhance feature representation across various scenario\\ntypes. We develop an adaptive feature pruning module that ranks feature\\nimportance to capture the most relevant information while reducing the\\ninterference of noisy information during training. Moreover, we propose a\\ncross-scenario feature interpolation module that enhances scenario information\\nto introduce diversity, enabling the network to alleviate over-fitting in\\ndominant scenarios. We evaluate our method CAFE-AD on the challenging public\\nnuPlan Test14-Hard closed-loop simulation benchmark. The results demonstrate\\nthat CAFE-AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods including rule-based and\\nhybrid planners, and exhibits the potential in mitigating the impact of\\nlong-tail distribution within the dataset. Additionally, we further validate\\nits effectiveness in real-world environments. The code and models will be made\\navailable at https://github.com/AlniyatRui/CAFE-AD.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T05:16:29Z\"}"}
