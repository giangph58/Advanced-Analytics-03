{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17634v1\", \"title\": \"Sparsity-Exploiting Channel Estimation For Unsourced Random Access With\\n  Fluid Antenna\", \"summary\": \"This work explores the channel estimation (CE) problem in uplink transmission\\nfor unsourced random access (URA) with a fluid antenna receiver. The additional\\nspatial diversity in a fluid antenna system (FAS) addresses the needs of URA\\ndesign in multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems. We present two CE\\nstrategies based on the activation of different FAS ports, namely alternate\\nports and partial ports CE. Both strategies facilitate the estimation of\\nchannel coefficients and angles of arrival (AoAs). Additionally, we discuss how\\nto refine channel estimation by leveraging the sparsity of finite scatterers.\\nSpecifically, the proposed partial ports CE strategy is implemented using a\\nregularized estimator, and we optimize the estimator's parameter to achieve the\\ndesired AoA precision and refinement. Extensive numerical results demonstrate\\nthe feasibility of the proposed strategies, and a comparison with a\\nconventional receiver using half-wavelength antennas highlights the promising\\nfuture of integrating URA and FAS.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:07:12Z\"}"}
