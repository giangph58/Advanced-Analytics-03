To address the high computational overhead, fiber-wise sampled\\nsubtensors that preserve the original tensor rank are often used in designing\\nefficient and scalable tensor dimensionality reduction. However, the theory of\\nproperty inheritance for subtensors is still underdevelopment, that is, how the\\nessential properties of the original tensor will be passed to its subtensors.\\nThis paper theoretically studies the property inheritance of the two key tensor\\nproperties, namely incoherence and condition number, under the tensor train\\nsetting. We also show how tensor train rank is preserved through fiber-wise\\nsampling. The key parameters introduced in theorems are numerically evaluated\\nunder various settings. The results show that the properties of interest can be\\nwell preserved to the subtensors formed via fiber-wise sampling. Overall, this\\npaper provides several handy analytic tools for developing efficient tensor\\nanalysis\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T17:10:38Z\"}"}
