{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15030v1\", \"title\": \"Height-Dependent Slow Magnetoacoustic Wave Amplitude and Energy Flux in\\n  Sunspot Atmospheres\", \"summary\": \"Slow magnetoacoustic waves (SMAWs) have been considered in the past as a\\npossible candidate for chromospheric heating. This study analyzes 20 active\\nregions observed between 2012 and 2016 to examine the amplitude and energy flux\\nvariation of SMAWs in the umbral atmosphere. Six different wavelength channels\\nfrom the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory,\\ncovering regions from the photosphere to the low corona, were utilized for this\\npurpose. The wave amplitude estimations show a gradual increase in 3-minute\\noscillation amplitude, peaking between 700--900 km, followed by a steady\\ndecrease; at altitudes greater than 1800 km, the amplitude appears to increase\\nand then decrease again. The corresponding energy flux, on the other hand,\\ndisplays a steady and monotonous decrease with a significant reduction in value\\nfrom approximately $3.32 \\\\pm 0.50~\\\\mathrm{kW,m^{-2}}$ near the photosphere to\\nabout $(6.47 \\\\pm 3.16) \\\\times 10^{-4}~\\\\mathrm{W,m^{-2}}$ at an altitude of 2585\\nkm. This decay may be attributed to radiative damping and shock dissipation in\\nthe lower altitudes, and thermal conduction and viscosity in the higher\\naltitudes. The missing flux is a factor of 3--15 lower than that required to\\ncounterbalance the chromospheric radiative losses.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T11:35:41Z\"}"}
