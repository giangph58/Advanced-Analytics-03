We prove that the error\\nof the reduced Nitsche solution converges optimally with respect to the\\napproximation order of the finite element spaces and linearly with respect to\\nthe dimension reduction parameter $\\\\epsilon$. Numerical tests with nontrivial\\ntetrahedral meshes using second-degree polynomial bases support the theoretical\\nresults.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:57:06Z\"}"}
