In this work, we have fabricated a\\nLaAlO3/KTaO3 interface superconductor patterned with a nanohoneycomb array of\\ninsulating islands. Little-Parks-like magnetoresistance oscillations have been\\nobserved, which are dictated by the superconducting flux quantum h/2e.\\nMoreover, an anomalous negative magnetoresistance (ANMR) appears under a weak\\nmagnetic field, suggesting magnetic-field-enhanced superconductivity. By\\nexamining their dependences on temperature, measurement current, and electrical\\ngating, we conclude that both phenomena are associated with superconducting\\norder parameter: The h/2e oscillations provide direct evidence of Cooper pair\\ntransport; the ANMR is interpreted as a consequence of multiple connected\\nnarrow superconducting paths with strong fluctuations.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T06:49:00Z\"}"}
