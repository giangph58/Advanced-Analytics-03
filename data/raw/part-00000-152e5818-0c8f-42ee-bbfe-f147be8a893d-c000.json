We generalize the results of\\nGauduchon and Moroianu, 2020, by showing that a symmetric space of rank 1 has\\ndiagonal coordinates if and only if it has constant sectional curvature. This\\nimplies that orthogonal separation of variables on a symmetric space of rank 1\\nis possible only in the constant sectional curvature case. We show that on the\\ncomplex projective space $\\\\mathbb{C}P^n$ and on complex hyperbolic space\\n$\\\\mathbb{C}H^n$, with $n\\\\ge 2$, separating coordinates necessarily have\\nprecisely $n$ ignorable coordinates.\\n  In view of results of Boyer et al, 1983 and 1985, and later results of\\nWinternitz et al, 1994, this completes the description of separation of\\nvariables on $\\\\mathbb{C}P^n$ for all $n$ and on $\\\\mathbb{C}H^n$ for $n=2,3$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG,math-ph,math.DS,math.MP,nlin.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:26:51Z\"}"}
