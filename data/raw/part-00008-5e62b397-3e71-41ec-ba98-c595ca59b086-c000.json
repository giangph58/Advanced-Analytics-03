The type-\\\\uppercase\\\\expandafter{\\\\romannumeral1} seesaw mechanism\\ngives rise to the Dirac and Majorana mass terms of neutrinos by introducing the\\ngauge-singlet right-handed neutrinos, which are usually called sterile\\nneutrinos. Using chiral perturbation theory, the transition amplitudes in the\\ncase of the light and heavy sterile neutrinos are calculated up to\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}(Q^2/\\\\Lambda^2_\\\\chi)$ respectively, where $Q$ is the typical\\nlow-energy scale in this process and $\\\\Lambda_\\\\chi$ the chiral symmetry\\nbreaking scale. We then adopt a naive interpolation formula of mass dependence\\nto obtain the amplitude in the full mass range and briefly discuss its\\nvalidity.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T08:47:31Z\"}"}
