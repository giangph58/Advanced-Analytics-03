{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17788v1\", \"title\": \"Dynamic Camera Poses and Where to Find Them\", \"summary\": \"Annotating camera poses on dynamic Internet videos at scale is critical for\\nadvancing fields like realistic video generation and simulation. However,\\ncollecting such a dataset is difficult, as most Internet videos are unsuitable\\nfor pose estimation. Furthermore, annotating dynamic Internet videos present\\nsignificant challenges even for state-of-theart methods. In this paper, we\\nintroduce DynPose-100K, a large-scale dataset of dynamic Internet videos\\nannotated with camera poses. Our collection pipeline addresses filtering using\\na carefully combined set of task-specific and generalist models. For pose\\nestimation, we combine the latest techniques of point tracking, dynamic\\nmasking, and structure-from-motion to achieve improvements over the\\nstate-of-the-art approaches. Our analysis and experiments demonstrate that\\nDynPose-100K is both large-scale and diverse across several key attributes,\\nopening up avenues for advancements in various downstream applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T17:59:56Z\"}"}
