The approach utilizes composite pulse sequences by effectively mapping\\nthe three-state system onto an equivalent two-level system. This transformation\\nallows the use of broadband composite pulses designed initially for\\nconventional two-state quantum systems. Unlike traditional implementations, the\\ncomposite pulses in the three-level system are not controlled through phase\\nadjustments; instead, they are realized via the amplitude ratio of the Rabi\\nfrequencies.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T07:32:00Z\"}"}
