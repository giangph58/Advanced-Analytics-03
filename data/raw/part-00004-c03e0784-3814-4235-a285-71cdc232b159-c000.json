{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04968v1\", \"title\": \"Dynamic Precoding for Near-Field Secure Communications: Implementation\\n  and Performance Analysis\", \"summary\": \"The increase in antenna apertures and transmission frequencies in\\nnext-generation wireless networks is catalyzing advancements in near-field\\ncommunications (NFC). In this paper, we investigate secure transmission in\\nnear-field multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) scenarios.\\nSpecifically, with the advent of extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAA)\\napplied in the NFC regime, the spatial degrees of freedom in the channel matrix\\nare significantly enhanced. This creates an expanded null space that can be\\nexploited for designing secure communication schemes. Motivated by this\\nobservation, we propose a near-field dynamic hybrid beamforming architecture\\nincorporating artificial noise, which effectively disrupts eavesdroppers at any\\nundesired positions, even in the absence of their channel state information\\n(CSI). Furthermore, we comprehensively analyze the dynamic precoder's\\nperformance in terms of the average signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio,\\nachievable rate, secrecy capacity, secrecy outage probability, and the size of\\nthe secrecy zone. In contrast to far-field secure transmission techniques that\\nonly enhance security in the angular dimension, the proposed algorithm exploits\\nthe unique properties of spherical wave characteristics in NFC to achieve\\nsecure transmission in both the angular and distance dimensions. Remarkably,\\nthe proposed algorithm is applicable to arbitrary modulation types and array\\nconfigurations. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves\\napproximately 20\\\\% higher rate capacity compared to zero-forcing and the\\nweighted minimum mean squared error precoders.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,eess.SP,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T05:59:57Z\"}"}
