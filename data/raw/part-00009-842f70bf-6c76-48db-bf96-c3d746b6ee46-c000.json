Let $I$ be a support-2 monomial ideal such that its\\nirreducible primary decomposition is minimal. We prove that $I$ is a Simis\\nideal if and only if $\\\\sqrt{I}$ is Simis and $I$ has standard linear weights.\\nThis result thereby proves a recent conjecture for the class of support-2\\nmonomial ideals proposed by Mendez, Pinto, and Villarreal. Furthermore, we give\\na complete characterization of the Cohen-Macaulay property for support-2\\nmonomial ideals whose radical is the edge ideal of a whiskered graph. Finally,\\nwe classify when these ideals are Simis in degree 2.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AC\", \"categories\": \"math.AC,math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T17:03:08Z\"}"}
