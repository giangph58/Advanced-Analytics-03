In this paper, to\\nachieve high accuracy with acceptable computational workload, we propose a\\ncost-effective regions of interest (RoIs) extraction and adaptive inference\\nscheme based on the informative encoding metadata. Specifically, to achieve\\nefficient RoI-based analytics, we explore motion vectors from encoding metadata\\nto identify RoIs in non-reference frames through morphological opening\\noperation. Furthermore, considering the content variation of RoIs, which calls\\nfor inference by models with distinct size, we measure RoI complexity based on\\nthe bitrate allocation information from encoding metadata. Finally, we design\\nan algorithm that prioritizes scheduling RoIs to models of the appropriate\\ncomplexity, balancing accuracy and latency. Extensive experimental results show\\nthat our proposed scheme reduces latency by nearly 40% and improves 2.2% on\\naverage in accuracy, outperforming the latest benchmarks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MM\", \"categories\": \"cs.MM\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:12:02Z\"}"}
