This study proposes a novel Building-Guided Pseudo-Label Learning\\nFramework to address the challenges of mapping building damage from\\npre-disaster optical and post-disaster SAR images. First, we train a series of\\nbuilding extraction models using pre-disaster optical images and building\\nlabels. To enhance building segmentation, we employ multi-model fusion and\\ntest-time augmentation strategies to generate pseudo-probabilities, followed by\\na low-uncertainty pseudo-label training method for further refinement. Next, a\\nchange detection model is trained on bi-temporal cross-modal images and damaged\\nbuilding labels. To improve damage classification accuracy, we introduce a\\nbuilding-guided low-uncertainty pseudo-label refinement strategy, which\\nleverages building priors from the previous step to guide pseudo-label\\ngeneration for damaged buildings, reducing uncertainty and enhancing\\nreliability. Experimental results on the 2025 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest\\ndataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which achieved the\\nhighest mIoU score (54.28%) and secured first place in the competition.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T04:37:12Z\"}"}
