All the masses of the Higgs bosons are purely determined by the vacuum\\nexpectation value of the Higgs fields, and are thus constrained to be smaller\\nthan ${\\\\cal O}(500)$ GeV by the perturbative unitarity bound. Such a\\nnon-decoupling nature predicts sizable deviations from the standard model\\nexpectations in the observables of the discovered Higgs boson ($h$). We find\\nthat the magnitude of deviations in ${\\\\cal B}_{h \\\\to \\\\gamma\\\\gamma}$ (${\\\\cal\\nB}_{h \\\\to Z\\\\gamma}$) are larger than $\\\\sim 10\\\\%~(4\\\\%)$ in the Higgs alignment\\nlimit. Moreover, we show that a robust correlation emerges between the\\ndeviations in the one-loop corrected $hhh$ coupling and ${\\\\cal B}_{h \\\\to\\n\\\\gamma\\\\gamma}$ to be, e.g., $200~(50)\\\\%$ and $-10.3$ ($-10.8)\\\\%$, respectively,\\nunder the constraints from theoretical bounds and current experimental data.\\nUsing a few benchmark points, we highlight that flavor-violating decays of the\\nadditional Higgs bosons can be sizable due to the constrained structure of the\\nYukawa interactions.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T10:07:13Z\"}"}
