{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15566v1\", \"title\": \"Minimization of Curve Length through Energy Minimization using Finite\\n  Difference and Numerical Integration in Real Coordinate Space\", \"summary\": \"The problem of determining the minimal length is garnering attention in\\nvarious fields such as computer vision, robotics, and machine learning. One\\nsolution to this problem involves linearly interpolating the solution of a\\nnonlinear optimization problem that approximates the curve's energy\\nminimization problem using finite differences and numerical integration. This\\nmethod tends to be easier to implement compared to others. However, it was\\npreviously unknown whether this approach successfully minimizes the curve's\\nlength under the Riemannian metric in real coordinate spaces. In this paper, we\\nprove that the length of a curve obtained by linear interpolation of the\\nsolution to an optimization problem, where the energy of the curve is\\napproximated using finite differences and the trapezoidal rule, converges to\\nthe minimal curve length at a rate of $1/2$ in terms of the number of points\\nused in the numerical integration. Similarly, we prove that when using the\\nleft-point rule, the approximated curve's length likewise converges to the\\nminimal curve length at a rate of $1/2$ in terms of the number of points used\\nin the numerical integration.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA,math.DG,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T03:35:08Z\"}"}
