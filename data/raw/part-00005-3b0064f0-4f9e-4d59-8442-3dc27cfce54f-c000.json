They reported the\\narithmetic mean of the three most stable tracers (Cepheids, tip of the red\\ngiant branch, and surface brightness fluctuations). The arithmetic mean is one\\nof the measures of central tendency of a distribution; others are the median\\nand mode. The three do not align for asymmetric distributions, which is the\\ncase for the distance moduli $\\\\mu_0$ to M87. I construct a kernel density\\ndistribution of the set of $\\\\mu_0$ and estimate the recommended distance to M87\\nas its mode, obtaining $\\\\mu_0 =\\n\\\\left(31.06~\\\\pm~0.001\\\\,\\\\textrm{(statistical)}\\\\,^{+0.04}_{-0.06}\\\\,\\\\textrm{(systematic)}\\\\right)$~mag,\\ncorresponding to \\\\linebreak $D=16.29^{+0.30}_{-0.45}$~Mpc, which yields\\nuncertainties smaller than those associated with the mean and median.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:35:55Z\"}"}
