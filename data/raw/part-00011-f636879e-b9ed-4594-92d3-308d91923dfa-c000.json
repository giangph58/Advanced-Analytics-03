{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20755v1\", \"title\": \"Low dose gamma irradiation study of ATLAS ITk MD8 diodes\", \"summary\": \"Silicon strip detectors developed for the Inner Tracker (ITk) of the ATLAS\\nexperiment will operate in a harsh radiation environment of the HL-LHC\\naccelerator. The ITk is thus designed to endure a total fluence of 1.6E15 1MeV\\nn_eq/cm2 and a total ionizing dose (TID) of 66 Mrad in the strip detector\\nregion. A radiation-hard n^+-in-p technology is implemented in the ITk strip\\nsensors. To achieve the required radiation hardness, extensive irradiation\\nstudies were conducted during sensor development, primarily performed up to the\\nmaximal expected total fluence and TID to ensure a full functionality of the\\ndetector at its end-of-life. These studies included irradiations of sensors\\nwith various particle types and energies, including the Co60 gamma-rays. Our\\nprevious results obtained for gamma-irradiated diodes and strip sensors\\nindicate a linear increase of bulk current with TID, while the surface current\\nsaturates at the lowest TID levels checked (66 Mrad), preventing a\\ndetermination of the exact TID for which the observed saturation occurs. This\\nwork presents the results coming from irradiations by Co60 gamma-rays to\\nmultiple low TIDs, ranging from 0.5 to 100 krad. The detailed study of total,\\nbulk, and surface currents of diodes explores an unknown dependence of surface\\ncurrent on the TID, annealing, and temperature. Additionally, the effect of the\\np-stop implant between the bias and the guard ring of measured samples is\\nshown. The observations are relevant for the initial operations of the new\\nATLAS tracker.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:34:38Z\"}"}
