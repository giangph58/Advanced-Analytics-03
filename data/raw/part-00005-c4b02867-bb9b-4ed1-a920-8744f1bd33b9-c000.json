{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12719v1\", \"title\": \"B*: Efficient and Optimal Base Placement for Fixed-Base Manipulators\", \"summary\": \"B* is a novel optimization framework that addresses a critical challenge in\\nfixed-base manipulator robotics: optimal base placement. Current methods rely\\non pre-computed kinematics databases generated through sampling to search for\\nsolutions. However, they face an inherent trade-off between solution optimality\\nand computational efficiency when determining sampling resolution. To address\\nthese limitations, B* unifies multiple objectives without database dependence.\\nThe framework employs a two-layer hierarchical approach. The outer layer\\nsystematically manages terminal constraints through progressive tightening,\\nparticularly for base mobility, enabling feasible initialization and broad\\nsolution exploration. The inner layer addresses non-convexities in each\\nouter-layer subproblem through sequential local linearization, converting the\\noriginal problem into tractable sequential linear programming (SLP). Testing\\nacross multiple robot platforms demonstrates B*'s effectiveness. The framework\\nachieves solution optimality five orders of magnitude better than\\nsampling-based approaches while maintaining perfect success rates and reduced\\ncomputational overhead. Operating directly in configuration space, B* enables\\nsimultaneous path planning with customizable optimization criteria. B* serves\\nas a crucial initialization tool that bridges the gap between theoretical\\nmotion planning and practical deployment, where feasible trajectory existence\\nis fundamental.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T07:48:50Z\"}"}
