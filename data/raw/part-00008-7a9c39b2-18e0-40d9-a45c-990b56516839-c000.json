{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20890v1\", \"title\": \"Thermodynamic interpretation to Stochastic Fisher Information and\\n  Single-Trajectory Speed Limits\", \"summary\": \"The Fisher information (FI) metric is a Riemannian metric that allows a\\ngeometric treatment of stochastic thermodynamics, introducing the possibility\\nof computing thermodynamic lengths and deviations from equilibrium. At the\\ntrajectory level, a related quantity can be introduced, the stochastic Fisher\\ninformation (SFI), which on average, is equivalent to the FI. In this work, we\\ndiscuss two fundamental questions regarding the SFI; namely, (i) what is the\\nthermodynamic interpretation of the SFI is and (ii) whether there are any\\ntrajectory-level thermodynamic bounds due to the SFI. We find that, contrary to\\nprevious results in the literature for the FI, the thermodynamic interpretation\\nof the SFI depends only on the entropy produced by the system and on the\\nthermodynamic force. Moreover, we find that the SFI allows one to derive\\nsingle-trajectory speed limits, which we demonstrate to hold for a Brownian\\nparticle under a saturating drive force and a Brownian particle under a\\ndecreasing drive force. From the ensemble of single-trajectory bounds one can\\nderive a hierarchy of average speed limits that are always less tight than the\\none derived from the FI. We test our results for speed limits on the adopted\\nmodels and find that the hierarchy of average speed limits is respected and\\nthat the single-trajectory speed limits behave qualitatively similarly to the\\naverage and stochastic speed limits, with some trajectories achieving\\nvelocities higher than the tightest average bound whenever it does not\\nsaturate. Our results open avenues for the exploration of uncertainty relations\\nat the trajectory level.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T16:07:31Z\"}"}
