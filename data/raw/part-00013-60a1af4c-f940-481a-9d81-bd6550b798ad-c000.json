Fuchs et al. and by the author, we study\\nrational and integral points on Markoff-type K3 (MK3) surfaces, i.e., Wehler K3\\nsurfaces of Markoff type. In particular, we construct a family of MK3 surfaces\\nwhich have a Zariski dense set of rational points but fail the integral Hasse\\nprinciple due to the Brauer-Manin obstruction and provide some counting results\\nfor this family. We also give some remarks on Brauer groups, Picard groups, and\\nfailure of strong approximation on MK3 surfaces.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT,math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T09:08:55Z\"}"}
