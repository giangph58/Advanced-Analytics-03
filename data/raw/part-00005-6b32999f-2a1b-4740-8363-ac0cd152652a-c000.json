Here we present the application of\\ntime-domain Fourier transform spectroscopy, based on a compact and stable\\nbirefringent interferometer coupled to low-dark-count superconducting\\nsingle-photon detectors, to the study of quantum emitters. We experimentally\\ndemonstrate that the system enables spectroscopy of quantum emitters over a\\nbroad wavelength interval from the near-infrared to the telecom range, where\\ngrating-based spectrometers coupled to InGaAs cameras are typically noisy and\\ninefficient. We further show that the high temporal resolution of single-photon\\ndetectors, which can be on the order of tens of picoseconds, enables the\\nmonitoring of spin-dependent spectral changes on sub-nanosecond timescales.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.mes-hall,physics.chem-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T17:38:20Z\"}"}
