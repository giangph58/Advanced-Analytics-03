Currently, most approaches integrate perception, prediction,\\nand planning modules into a fully differentiable network, promising great\\nscalability. However, these methods typically rely on deterministic modeling of\\nonline maps in the perception module for guiding or constraining vehicle\\nplanning, which may incorporate erroneous perception information and further\\ncompromise planning safety. To address this issue, we delve into the importance\\nof online map uncertainty for enhancing autonomous driving safety and propose a\\nnovel paradigm named UncAD. Specifically, UncAD first estimates the uncertainty\\nof the online map in the perception module. It then leverages the uncertainty\\nto guide motion prediction and planning modules to produce multi-modal\\ntrajectories. Finally, to achieve safer autonomous driving, UncAD proposes an\\nuncertainty-collision-aware planning selection strategy according to the online\\nmap uncertainty to evaluate and select the best trajectory. In this study, we\\nincorporate UncAD into various state-of-the-art (SOTA) end-to-end methods.\\nExperiments on the nuScenes dataset show that integrating UncAD, with only a\\n1.9% increase in parameters, can reduce collision rates by up to 26% and\\ndrivable area conflict rate by up to 42%.
