{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11372v1\", \"title\": \"A Review of Traffic Wave Suppression Strategies: Variable Speed Limit\\n  vs. Jam-Absorption Driving\", \"summary\": \"The main form of freeway traffic congestion is the familiar stop-and-go wave,\\ncharacterized by wide moving jams that propagate indefinitely upstream provided\\nenough traffic demand. They cause severe, long-lasting adverse effects, such as\\nreduced traffic efficiency, increased driving risks, and higher vehicle\\nemissions. This underscores the crucial importance of artificial intervention\\nin the propagation of stop-and-go waves. Over the past two decades, two\\nprominent strategies for stop-and-go wave suppression have emerged: variable\\nspeed limit (VSL) and jam-absorption driving (JAD). Although they share similar\\nresearch motivations, objectives, and theoretical foundations, the development\\nof these strategies has remained relatively disconnected. To synthesize\\nfragmented advances and drive the field forward, this paper first provides a\\ncomprehensive review of the achievements in the stop-and-go wave\\nsuppression-oriented VSL and JAD, respectively. It then focuses on bridging the\\ntwo areas and identifying research opportunities from the following\\nperspectives: fundamental diagrams, traffic dynamics modeling, traffic state\\nestimation and prediction, stochasticity, scenarios for strategy validation,\\nand field tests and practical deployment. We expect that through this review,\\none area can effectively address its limitations by identifying and leveraging\\nthe strengths of the other, thus promoting the overall research goal of freeway\\nstop-and-go wave suppression.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph,cs.SY,eess.SY,stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:37:23Z\"}"}
