The observations reveal a remarkably close match between the\\norientation of the [CII] and thermal dust emission mapped by ALMA, and radio\\nsynchrotron emission of a radio jet previously mapped by the VLBA. This narrow\\nalignment extends over ~4kpc, reminiscent of the well-studied 'alignment\\neffect' in lower-redshift radio galaxies. The [CII] kinematics show a linear\\nincrease in velocity with galactocentric radii up to ~200 km/s at r=2kpc,\\nconsistent with bulk motions within the galaxy potential, and not relativistic\\njet motions. The kinematics and respective morphologies are consistent with a\\npicture in which the relativistic jet injects energy into the interstellar\\nmedium (potentially leading to subsequent star formation), giving rise to the\\nobserved alignment and significant (> 100 km/s) [CII] velocity dispersion\\nwithin the host galaxy on kiloparsec scales. Indeed, the astonishingly close\\nalignment and narrow linearity of the radio jet with the [CII] and dust\\nemission are hard to conceive without some fundamental relationship between the\\ntwo.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T07:19:54Z\"}"}
