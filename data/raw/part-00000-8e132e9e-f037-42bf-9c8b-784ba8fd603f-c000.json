Our derivation of the optimal\\nparticipation rate reveals its pronounced sensitivity to the contract duration\\nand the associated tax rate. Moreover, the asset substitution effect, which\\ndescribes the tendency of equity holders to increase the riskiness of a\\ncompany's investment decisions, decreases when adding surplus participation.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.MF\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.MF\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T11:19:17Z\"}"}
