Beyond the experimental point-to-point\\ndemonstrations of the past few years, efforts are now underway to integrate QKD\\nat the network level: developing interfaces with the software-defined-network\\necosystem; but also network planning tools that satisfy physical-layer\\ncontraints jointly on the classical and quantum signals. We have found that in\\ncertain situations, na\\\\\\\"ive network planning prioritizing quantum traffic\\ndrastically degrades classical capacity, whereas a quantum-aware wavelength\\nassignment heuristic allows coexistence with minimal impact on both capacities.\\nMore such techniques will be required to enable widespread deployment of QKD\\nand other future quantum functionalities.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:41:34Z\"}"}
