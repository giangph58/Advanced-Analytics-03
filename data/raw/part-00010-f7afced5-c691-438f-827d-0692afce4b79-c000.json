{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11233v1\", \"title\": \"AutoRAN: Automated and Zero-Touch Open RAN Systems\", \"summary\": \"[...] This paper presents AutoRAN, an automated, intent-driven framework for\\nzero-touch provisioning of open, programmable cellular networks. Leveraging\\ncloud-native principles, AutoRAN employs virtualization, declarative\\ninfrastructure-as-code templates, and disaggregated micro-services to abstract\\nphysical resources and protocol stacks. Its orchestration engine integrates\\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to translate high-level intents into machine-readable\\nconfigurations, enabling closed-loop control via telemetry-driven\\nobservability. Implemented on a multi-architecture OpenShift cluster with\\nheterogeneous compute (x86/ARM CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs) and multi-vendor Radio Access\\nNetwork (RAN) hardware (Foxconn, NI), AutoRAN automates deployment of\\nO-RAN-compliant stacks-including OpenAirInterface, NVIDIA ARC RAN, Open5GS\\ncore, and O-RAN Software Community (OSC) RIC components-using CI/CD pipelines.\\nExperimental results demonstrate that AutoRAN is capable of deploying an\\nend-to-end Private 5G network in less than 60 seconds with 1.6 Gbps throughput,\\nvalidating its ability to streamline configuration, accelerate testing, and\\nreduce manual intervention with similar performance than non cloud-based\\nimplementations. With its novel LLM-assisted intent translation mechanism, and\\nperformance-optimized automation workflow for multi-vendor environments,\\nAutoRAN has the potential of advancing the robustness of next-generation\\ncellular supply chains through reproducible, intent-based provisioning across\\npublic and private deployments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:36:08Z\"}"}
