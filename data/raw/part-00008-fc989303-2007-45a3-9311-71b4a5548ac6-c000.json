{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03589v1\", \"title\": \"Affine Filter Bank Modulation: A New Waveform for High Mobility\\n  Communications\", \"summary\": \"We propose a new waveform suitable for integrated sensing and communications\\n(ISAC) systems facing doubly-dispersive (DD) channel conditions, as typically\\nencountered in high mobility scenarios. Dubbed Affine Filter Bank Modulation\\n(AFBM), this novel waveform is designed based on a filter-bank structure, known\\nfor its ability to suppress out-of-band emissions (OOBE), while integrating a\\ndiscrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT) precoding stage which yields low\\npeak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and robustness to DD distortion, as well as\\nother features desirable for ISAC. Analytical and simulation results\\ndemonstrate that AFBM maintains quasi-orthogonality similar to that of affine\\nfrequency division multiplexing (AFDM) in DD channels, while achieving PAPR\\nlevels 3 dB lower, in addition to OOBE as low as -100 dB when implemented with\\nPHYDYAS prototype filters.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T14:49:37Z\"}"}
