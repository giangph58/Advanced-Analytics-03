This paper introduces a methodologically developed taxonomy\\nderived from the analysis of 390 scientific papers and expert discussions.\\n  The resulting framework consists of 22 dimensions with 113 characteristics,\\norganized into three groups: trust anchor implementations, identity\\narchitectures (identifiers and credentials), and ledger specifications. This\\ntaxonomy facilitates the systematic analysis, comparison, and design of\\ndistributed-ledger-based identity solutions, as demonstrated through its\\napplication to two distinct architectures.\\n  As the first methodology-driven taxonomy in this field, this work advances\\nstandardization and enhances understanding of distributed-ledger-based identity\\narchitectures. It provides researchers and practitioners with a structured\\nframework for evaluating design decisions and implementation approaches.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T09:57:17Z\"}"}
