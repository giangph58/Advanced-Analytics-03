Building upon traditional control theory's foundation in individual\\nsystems, we introduce tools designed to address the unique challenges of\\ncoordinating networks that exhibit emergent phenomena, including consensus,\\nsynchronization, and pattern formation. We analyze how local agent interactions\\ngenerate macroscopic behaviors and investigate the fundamental role of network\\ntopology in determining system dynamics. Inspired by natural systems, we\\nemphasize control strategies that achieve global coordination through localized\\ninterventions while considering practical implementation challenges. The\\nchapter concludes by presenting novel frameworks for managing very large agent\\nensembles and leveraging interacting networks for control purposes.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T09:21:09Z\"}"}
