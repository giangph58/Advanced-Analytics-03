{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10871v1\", \"title\": \"DAAF:Degradation-Aware Adaptive Fusion Framework for Robust Infrared and\\n  Visible Images Fusion\", \"summary\": \"Existing infrared and visible image fusion(IVIF) algorithms often prioritize\\nhigh-quality images, neglecting image degradation such as low light and noise,\\nwhich limits the practical potential. This paper propose Degradation-Aware\\nAdaptive image Fusion (DAAF), which achieves unified modeling of adaptive\\ndegradation optimization and image fusion. Specifically, DAAF comprises an\\nauxiliary Adaptive Degradation Optimization Network (ADON) and a Feature\\nInteractive Local-Global Fusion (FILGF) Network. Firstly, ADON includes\\ninfrared and visible-light branches. Within the infrared branch,\\nfrequency-domain feature decomposition and extraction are employed to isolate\\nGaussian and stripe noise. In the visible-light branch, Retinex decomposition\\nis applied to extract illumination and reflectance components, enabling\\ncomplementary enhancement of detail and illumination distribution.\\nSubsequently, FILGF performs interactive multi-scale local-global feature\\nfusion. Local feature fusion consists of intra-inter model feature complement,\\nwhile global feature fusion is achieved through a interactive cross-model\\nattention. Extensive experiments have shown that DAAF outperforms current IVIF\\nalgorithms in normal and complex degradation scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T05:02:49Z\"}"}
