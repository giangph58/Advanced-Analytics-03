Traditional parameter identification methods often require\\nextensive data collection experiments and lack adaptability in dynamic\\nenvironments. This paper describes a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based approach\\nthat dynamically tailors the current profile applied to a LiB cell to optimize\\nthe parameters identifiability of the electrochemical model. The proposed\\nframework is implemented in real-time using a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) setup,\\nwhich serves as a reliable testbed for evaluating the RL-based design strategy.\\nThe HIL validation confirms that the RL-based experimental design outperforms\\nconventional test protocols used for parameter identification in terms of both\\nreducing the modeling errors on a verification test and minimizing the duration\\nof the experiment used for parameter identification.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.LG,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T04:25:50Z\"}"}
