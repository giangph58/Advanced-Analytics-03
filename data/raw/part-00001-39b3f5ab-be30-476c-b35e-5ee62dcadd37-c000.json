{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12038v1\", \"title\": \"Periodic Potential for Point Defects in a 2D Hexagonal Colloidal Lattice\", \"summary\": \"We explore the statistical nature of point defects in a two-dimensional\\nhexagonal colloidal crystal from the perspective of stochastic dynamics.\\nStarting from the experimentally recorded trajectories of time series, the\\nunderlying drifting forces along with the diffusion matrix from thermal\\nfluctuations are extracted. We then employ a deposition in which the\\ndeterministic terms are split into diffusive and transverse components under a\\nstochastic potential with the lattice periodicity to uncover the dynamic\\nlandscape as well as the transverse matrix, two key structures from limited\\nranges of measurements. The analysis elucidates some fundamental dichotomy\\nbetween mono-point and di-point defects of paired vacancies or interstitials.\\nHaving large transverse magnitude, the second class of defects are likely to\\nbreak the detailed balance, Such a scenario was attributed to the root cause of\\nlattice melting by experimental observations. The constructed potential can in\\nturn facilitate large-scale simulation for the ongoing research.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T12:53:51Z\"}"}
