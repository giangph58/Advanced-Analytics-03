However, dry etching of PPLNOI waveguides often generates rough\\nsidewalls and variations in the etching rates of oppositely poled lithium\\nniobate ferroelectric domains, leading a relatively high propagation losses\\n(0.25 - 1 dB/cm), which significantly limits net conversion efficiency and\\nhinders scalable photonic integration. In this work, a low-loss PPLNOI ridge\\nwaveguide with a length of 7 mm was fabricated using ultra-smooth sidewalls\\nthrough photolithography-assisted chemo-mechanical etching followed by\\nhigh-voltage pulse poling. The average surface roughness was measured at just\\n0.27 nm, resulting in significantly lower propagation loss compared to\\ndry-etched counterparts. Highly efficient second-harmonic generation was\\ndemonstrated with a normalized efficiency of 1742%/(W*cm^2) and an overall\\nefficiency of 750.1%/W (without accounting for propagation loss). The absolute\\nconversion efficiency reached 15.8%, representing a six-fold improvement over\\nthe best previously reported values in single-period PPLNOI waveguides without\\nmagnesium oxide doping.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T08:16:41Z\"}"}
