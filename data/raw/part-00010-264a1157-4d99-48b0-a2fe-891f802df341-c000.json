In particular, bilayer\\ngraphene is known to be susceptible to quantum interference corrections of the\\nconductivity, presenting weak localization at all electronic densities, and\\ndependent on different scattering mechanisms as well as on the trigonal warping\\nof the electron dispersion near the K and K' valleys. Proximity effects with a\\nmolecular thin film influence these scattering mechanisms, which can be\\nquantified through the known theory of magnetoconductance for bilayer graphene.\\nHere, we present weak localization measurements in a copper-phthalocyanine /\\nbilayer graphene / h-BN heterostructure that suggest an important suppression\\nof trigonal warping effects in bilayer graphene (BLG), restoring the\\nmanifestation of the chirality of the charge carriers in the localization\\nproperties of BLG. Additionally, we observe a charge transfer of\\n3.6$\\\\times$10$^{12}$cm$^{-2}$ from the BLG to the molecules, as well as a very\\nsmall degradation of the mobility of the BLG/h-BN heterostructure upon the\\ndeposition of copper phthalocyanine (CuPc). The molecular arrangement of the\\nCuPc thin film is characterized in a control sample through transmission\\nelectron microscopy, that we relate to the electronic transport results.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:57:24Z\"}"}
