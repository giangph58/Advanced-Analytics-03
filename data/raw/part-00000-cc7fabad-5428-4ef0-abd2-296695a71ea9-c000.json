Via a dimensional-reduction approach, we derive a new\\naxion-electromagnetic coupling term involving three axion fields. This term\\nyields a topological current in the bulk and, under specific conditions of the\\naxions, real-space topological defects such as magnetic-like monopoles and\\nhopfions. Moreover, once one the axions acquires a constant value, a nontrivial\\nboundary theory realizes a (2+1)-dimensional analog of the Witten effect, which\\nshows that point-like vortices on the gapped boundary of the system acquire\\nhalf-integer electric charge. Our findings reveal rich topological structures\\nemerging from multi-axion theories, suggesting new avenues in the study of\\ntopological phases and defects.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,hep-th,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T17:45:36Z\"}"}
