The current approach to UK CDC can be described as shared-indexation,\\nwhere the nominal benefit of every member in a scheme receives the same level\\nof indexation each year. The design of such schemes rely on the use of\\napproximate discounting methodologies to value liabilities, and this leads to\\nintergenerational cross-subsidies which can be large and unpredictable. We\\npresent an alternative approach which we call Collective-Drawdown CDC. This\\napproach does not result in intergenerational cross-subsidies since all pooling\\nis performed by explicit insurance contracts. It is therefore completely fair.\\nMoreover, this scheme results in better pension outcomes when compared to\\nshared-indexation CDC under the same model parameters.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.PM\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.PM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T17:15:35Z\"}"}
