We study the endpoints of Wilson lines in large\\n$N$ bosonic QED$_3$. at its critical point. We first study the stability of an\\ninfinite Wilson line in the $\\\\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ model by computing the\\nappropriate functional determinant at large $N$. We also compute the conformal\\ndimension of the lowest-dimension endpoint of the line to first order in\\n$N^{-1}$. Along the way we calculate the field-strength tensor $F_{\\\\mu\\\\nu}$ in\\nthe presence of the line with endpoint and discuss a state-operator\\ncorrespondence for the endpoints, as well as the existence of an OPE that\\nallows two open-ended Wilson lines to be glued together into a single line.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T16:28:46Z\"}"}
