We outline the\\ndesign of the experimental cell and magnet, and show that the performance of\\nthe magnet is consistent with simulations, including the capability to\\nproducing the high field gradient required for generating a bubble. Future\\nplans include the investigation of possible intrinsic mechanisms underpinning\\nthe A-B transition, with potential implications for early-universe cosmological\\nphase transitions.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.other\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.other\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:35:56Z\"}"}
