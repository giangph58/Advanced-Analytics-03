{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21772v1\", \"title\": \"LOCORE: Image Re-ranking with Long-Context Sequence Modeling\", \"summary\": \"We introduce LOCORE, Long-Context Re-ranker, a model that takes as input\\nlocal descriptors corresponding to an image query and a list of gallery images\\nand outputs similarity scores between the query and each gallery image. This\\nmodel is used for image retrieval, where typically a first ranking is performed\\nwith an efficient similarity measure, and then a shortlist of top-ranked images\\nis re-ranked based on a more fine-grained similarity measure. Compared to\\nexisting methods that perform pair-wise similarity estimation with local\\ndescriptors or list-wise re-ranking with global descriptors, LOCORE is the\\nfirst method to perform list-wise re-ranking with local descriptors. To achieve\\nthis, we leverage efficient long-context sequence models to effectively capture\\nthe dependencies between query and gallery images at the local-descriptor\\nlevel. During testing, we process long shortlists with a sliding window\\nstrategy that is tailored to overcome the context size limitations of sequence\\nmodels. Our approach achieves superior performance compared with other\\nre-rankers on established image retrieval benchmarks of landmarks (ROxf and\\nRPar), products (SOP), fashion items (In-Shop), and bird species (CUB-200)\\nwhile having comparable latency to the pair-wise local descriptor re-rankers.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:59:44Z\"}"}
