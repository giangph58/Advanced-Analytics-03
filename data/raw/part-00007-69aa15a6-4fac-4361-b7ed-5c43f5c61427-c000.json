Compared to the \\\"tunnel vision\\\" of standard cameras, their\\nborderless field of view offers a more complete perspective of our\\nsurroundings. While existing video models excel at producing standard videos,\\ntheir ability to generate full panoramic videos remains elusive. In this paper,\\nwe investigate the task of video-to-360{\\\\deg} generation: given a perspective\\nvideo as input, our goal is to generate a full panoramic video that is\\nconsistent with the original video. Unlike conventional video generation tasks,\\nthe output's field of view is significantly larger, and the model is required\\nto have a deep understanding of both the spatial layout of the scene and the\\ndynamics of objects to maintain spatio-temporal consistency. To address these\\nchallenges, we first leverage the abundant 360{\\\\deg} videos available online\\nand develop a high-quality data filtering pipeline to curate pairwise training\\ndata. We then carefully design a series of geometry- and motion-aware\\noperations to facilitate the learning process and improve the quality of\\n360{\\\\deg} video generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can\\ngenerate realistic and coherent 360{\\\\deg} videos from in-the-wild perspective\\nvideo. In addition, we showcase its potential applications, including video\\nstabilization, camera viewpoint control, and interactive visual question\\nanswering.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:51:38Z\"}"}
