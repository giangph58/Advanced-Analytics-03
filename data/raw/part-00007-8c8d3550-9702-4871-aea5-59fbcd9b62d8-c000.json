Our results\\noverall showcase how LLM behavior varies interestingly across models, but also\\ngeneral failings of these models in correctly capturing human-like preferences.\\nIn light of these results, we argue that RC attachment is the ideal benchmark\\nfor cross-linguistic investigations of LLMs' linguistic knowledge and biases.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T05:19:23Z\"}"}
