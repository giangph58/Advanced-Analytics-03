{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12042v1\", \"title\": \"Diverse regular spacetimes using a parametrised density profile\", \"summary\": \"We explore the construction of diverse regular spacetimes (black holes and\\ndefects) in General Relativity (GR) using a generic parametrised density\\nprofile (the Dekel-Zhao profile), which includes, for specific parameter\\nchoices, various well-known examples usually studied in the context of dark\\nmatter halos. Our solutions, in the Schwarzschild gauge, include new regular\\nblack holes as well as non-singular solutions representing spacetime defects.\\nFor a sub-class of metrics, a TOV equation approach with a chosen equation of\\nstate works. The status of the energy conditions and the issue of geodesic\\ncompleteness are explored in detail. We also provide possible Lagrangian\\ndensity constructions for the matter energy-momentum tensors. Further, we study\\nthe shadow radius of the new regular black holes, and compare our findings with\\navailable observational results from the EHT collaboration. Finally, for the\\ndefect solution, we present a model for a stable star (a gravastar) by explicit\\nuse of the junction conditions and obtain relevant consequences highlighting\\nits characteristic features.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T12:56:31Z\"}"}
