However, LST\\nretrieval is an ill-posed inverse problem, which becomes particularly severe\\nwhen only a single band is available. In this paper, we propose a deeply\\ncoupled framework integrating mechanistic modeling and machine learning to\\nenhance the accuracy and generalizability of single-channel LST retrieval.\\nTraining samples are generated using a physically-based radiative transfer\\nmodel and a global collection of 5810 atmospheric profiles. A physics-informed\\nmachine learning framework is proposed to systematically incorporate the first\\nprinciples from classical physical inversion models into the learning workflow,\\nwith optimization constrained by radiative transfer equations. Global\\nvalidation demonstrated a 30% reduction in root-mean-square error versus\\nstandalone methods. Under extreme humidity, the mean absolute error decreased\\nfrom 4.87 K to 2.29 K (53% improvement). Continental-scale tests across five\\ncontinents confirmed the superior generalizability of this model.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ao-ph,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T06:19:01Z\"}"}
