{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20981v1\", \"title\": \"Optical Activity of Group III-V Quantum Dots Directly Embedded in\\n  Silicon\", \"summary\": \"Optically active III-V group semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are the leading\\nelement of the upcoming safe quantum communication. However, the entire\\nelectronic and IT infrastructure relies on silicon-based devices, with silicon\\nalso providing a natural platform for photonic integration. Combining\\nsemiconductor optics with silicon electronics is thus a major technological\\nchallenge. This obstacle cannot be directly solved because silicon is optically\\ninactive. Interfacing III-V quantum dots with silicon is thus a sought-after\\nsolution. A radical approach is to embed III-V material grains directly into\\nsilicon. The first realization of such technology was developed, and it gave\\nInAs and core-shell InAs/GaAs QDs embedded in Si with bright and narrow\\nsingle-QD emission lines. No theory has been given, though, and, as we show\\nhere, it is not even obvious if and how such QDs can be optically active. We\\nfirst use general arguments, also supported by atomistic calculations, that\\nInAs/Si QDs cannot confine both carrier types unless the structural strain is\\nmostly relaxed, meaning many defects at the interface. This explains the lack\\nof light emission from those dots. Then we show that the InAs/GaAs/Si QDs can\\nconfine both carrier types. Their electron states are, however, highly\\ninfluenced by $k$-space valley mixing, which impacts emission spectra and\\ndeteriorates optical properties. We propose to overcome this by adding an\\nadditional wider-bandgap material layer.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:50:46Z\"}"}
