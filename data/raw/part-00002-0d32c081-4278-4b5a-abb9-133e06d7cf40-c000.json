{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15942v1\", \"title\": \"Adversarial Observations in Weather Forecasting\", \"summary\": \"AI-based systems, such as Google's GenCast, have recently redefined the state\\nof the art in weather forecasting, offering more accurate and timely\\npredictions of both everyday weather and extreme events. While these systems\\nare on the verge of replacing traditional meteorological methods, they also\\nintroduce new vulnerabilities into the forecasting process. In this paper, we\\ninvestigate this threat and present a novel attack on autoregressive diffusion\\nmodels, such as those used in GenCast, capable of manipulating weather\\nforecasts and fabricating extreme events, including hurricanes, heat waves, and\\nintense rainfall. The attack introduces subtle perturbations into weather\\nobservations that are statistically indistinguishable from natural noise and\\nchange less than 0.1% of the measurements - comparable to tampering with data\\nfrom a single meteorological satellite. As modern forecasting integrates data\\nfrom nearly a hundred satellites and many other sources operated by different\\ncountries, our findings highlight a critical security risk with the potential\\nto cause large-scale disruptions and undermine public trust in weather\\nprediction.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T14:38:13Z\"}"}
