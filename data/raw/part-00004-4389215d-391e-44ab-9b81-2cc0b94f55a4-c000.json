{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10893v1\", \"title\": \"ARise: Towards Knowledge-Augmented Reasoning via Risk-Adaptive Search\", \"summary\": \"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities and\\nare receiving increasing attention to enhance their reasoning through scaling\\ntest--time compute. However, their application in open--ended,\\nknowledge--intensive, complex reasoning scenarios is still limited.\\nReasoning--oriented methods struggle to generalize to open--ended scenarios due\\nto implicit assumptions of complete world knowledge. Meanwhile,\\nknowledge--augmented reasoning (KAR) methods fail to address two core\\nchallenges: 1) error propagation, where errors in early steps cascade through\\nthe chain, and 2) verification bottleneck, where the explore--exploit tradeoff\\narises in multi--branch decision processes. To overcome these limitations, we\\nintroduce ARise, a novel framework that integrates risk assessment of\\nintermediate reasoning states with dynamic retrieval--augmented generation\\n(RAG) within a Monte Carlo tree search paradigm. This approach enables\\neffective construction and optimization of reasoning plans across multiple\\nmaintained hypothesis branches. Experimental results show that ARise\\nsignificantly outperforms the state--of--the--art KAR methods by up to 23.10%,\\nand the latest RAG-equipped large reasoning models by up to 25.37%.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T06:06:50Z\"}"}
