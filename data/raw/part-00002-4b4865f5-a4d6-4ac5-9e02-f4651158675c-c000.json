{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19991v1\", \"title\": \"Mapping of Weed Management Methods in Orchards using Sentinel-2 and\\n  PlanetScope Data\", \"summary\": \"Effective weed management is crucial for improving agricultural productivity,\\nas weeds compete with crops for vital resources like nutrients and water.\\nAccurate maps of weed management methods are essential for policymakers to\\nassess farmer practices, evaluate impacts on vegetation health, biodiversity,\\nand climate, as well as ensure compliance with policies and subsidies. However,\\nmonitoring weed management methods is challenging as commonly rely on on-ground\\nfield surveys, which are often costly, time-consuming and subject to delays. In\\norder to tackle this problem, we leverage Earth Observation (EO) data and\\nMachine Learning (ML). Specifically, we developed an ML approach for mapping\\nfour distinct weed management methods (Mowing, Tillage, Chemical-spraying, and\\nNo practice) in orchards using satellite image time series (SITS) data from two\\ndifferent sources: Sentinel-2 (S2) and PlanetScope (PS). The findings\\ndemonstrate the potential of ML-driven remote sensing to enhance the efficiency\\nand accuracy of weed management mapping in orchards.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:09:10Z\"}"}
