In this work, we design a dual-function reconfigurable\\nintelligent surface (RIS), integrating both active and passive elements,\\nreferred to as the reconfigurable intelligent sensing surface (RISS), to\\nenhance communication. By leveraging sensing results from the active elements,\\nwe propose communication enhancement and robust interference suppression\\nschemes for both near-field and far-field models, implemented through the\\npassive elements. These schemes remove the need for base station (BS) feedback\\nfor RISS control, simplifying the communication process by replacing\\ntraditional channel state information (CSI) feedback with real-time sensing\\nfrom the active elements. The proposed schemes are theoretically analyzed and\\nthen validated using software-defined radio (SDR). Experimental results\\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the sensing algorithms in real-world\\nscenarios, such as direction of arrival (DOA) estimation and radio frequency\\n(RF) identification recognition. Moreover, the RISS-assisted communication\\nsystem shows strong performance in communication enhancement and interference\\nsuppression, particularly in near-field models.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T09:36:15Z\"}"}
