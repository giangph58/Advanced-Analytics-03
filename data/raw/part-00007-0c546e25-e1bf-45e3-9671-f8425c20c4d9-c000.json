However, the\\nwidespread adoption of autonomous ships necessitates a robust regulatory\\nframework and rigorous certification processes to address the unique challenges\\nposed by these advanced technologies. This paper proposes a gradual,\\nmulti-stage approach to the certification and integration of MASS, beginning\\nwith small-scale trials in controlled environments and progressing to\\nlarge-scale international operations. Key considerations include the\\ndevelopment of reliable control systems, cybersecurity measures, sensor\\ntechnologies, and redundancy mechanisms to ensure safe and efficient\\nnavigation. Additionally, the paper explores the economic and environmental\\nimplications of autonomous shipping, as well as the evolving legal frameworks\\nfor liability and compensation in the event of collisions. By adopting a\\ncautious and methodical approach, the maritime industry can mitigate risks and\\npave the way for the safe and sustainable integration of autonomous ships into\\nglobal trade.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T06:19:21Z\"}"}
