In\\ndetail, with regarding to McKean-Vlasov SDEs driven by pure jump L\\\\'{e}vy\\nprocesses, we principally (i) explore the existence of stationary distributions\\nvia Schauder's fixed point theorem under an appropriate Lyapunov condition;\\n(ii) tackle the uniqueness of stationary distributions and the convergence to\\nthe equilibria as long as the underlying drifts are continuous with respect to\\nthe measure variables under the weighted total variation distance and the\\n$L^1$-Wasserstein distance, respectively; (iii) demonstrate the multiplicity of\\nstationary distributions under a locally dissipative condition. In addition,\\nsome illustrative examples are provided to show that the associated\\nMcKean-Vlasov SDEs possess a unique, two and three stationary distributions,\\nrespectively.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T13:40:19Z\"}"}
