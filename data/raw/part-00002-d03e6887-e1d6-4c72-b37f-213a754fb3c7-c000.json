We focus on quantum emitters created in monolayer transition-metal\\ndichalcogenide semiconductors, which provide spectrally sharp single-photon\\nemission at cryogenic temperatures, and the ones in insulating hBN, which\\nprovide bright and stable single-photon emission up to room temperature. After\\nintroducing the different classes of quantum emitters in terms of\\nband-structure properties, we review the defect creation methods based on\\nelectron and ion irradiation as well as local strain engineering and plasma\\ntreatments. A main focus of the review is put on discussing the microscopic\\norigin of the quantum emitters as revealed by various experimental platforms,\\nincluding optical and scanning probe methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:12:45Z\"}"}
