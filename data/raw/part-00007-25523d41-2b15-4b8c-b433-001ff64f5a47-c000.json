These problems are inherently nonconvex, since the system\\ndynamics involves bilinear products between the discretization time step and\\nthe system state and controls. The proposed relaxation is closely related to\\nthe standard second-order semidefinite relaxation for quadratic constraints,\\nbut we carefully select a subset of the possible bilinear terms and apply a\\nchange of variables to achieve empirically tight relaxations while keeping the\\ncomputational load light. We further extend our method to handle\\npiecewise-affine (PWA) systems by formulating the PWA optimal-control problem\\nas a shortest-path problem in a graph of convex sets (GCS). In this GCS,\\ndifferent paths represent different mode sequences for the PWA system, and the\\nconvex sets model the relaxed dynamics within each mode. By combining a tight\\nconvex relaxation of the GCS problem with our semidefinite relaxation with time\\nscaling, we can solve PWA optimal-control problems through a single\\nsemidefinite program.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:59:23Z\"}"}
