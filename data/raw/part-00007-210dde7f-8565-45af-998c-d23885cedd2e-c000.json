Traditional\\noptimization practices rely on human specialists for problem formulation,\\nalgorithm selection, and hyperparameter tuning, creating bottlenecks that\\nimpede industrial adoption of cutting-edge methods. We contend that an\\nevolutionary agentic workflow, powered by foundation models and evolutionary\\nsearch, can autonomously navigate the optimization space, comprising problem,\\nformulation, algorithm, and hyperparameter spaces. Through case studies in\\ncloud resource scheduling and ADMM parameter adaptation, we demonstrate how\\nthis approach can bridge the gap between academic innovation and industrial\\nimplementation. Our position challenges the status quo of human-centric\\noptimization workflows and advocates for a more scalable, adaptive approach to\\nsolving real-world optimization problems.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T12:07:49Z\"}"}
