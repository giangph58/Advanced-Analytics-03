As some\\nof the ``metrics'' do not fulfill all properties of a metric (e.g. some lack\\nthe triangle inequality or the definiteness), we call them ``distances'' here.\\nTo the best of our knowledge, such distances are treated for the first time\\nhere. The present article shall serve as a starting point of further research\\n(see e.g. arXiv:2412.13165).\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA,math-ph,math.MP,math.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:39:21Z\"}"}
