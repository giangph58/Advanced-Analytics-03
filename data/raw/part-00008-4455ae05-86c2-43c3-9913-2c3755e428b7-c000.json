Here we study global patterns in the\\ncontext of signed permutations, with both characterizing and enumerative\\nresults. Surprisingly, many properties of signed permutations may be\\ncharacterized by avoidance of the same set of patterns as the corresponding\\nproperties in the symmetric group. We also extend previous enumerative work of\\nEgge, and our work has connections to the Garfinkle--Barbasch--Vogan\\ncorrespondence, the Erd\\\\H{o}s--Szekeres theorem, and well-known integer\\nsequences.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:22:46Z\"}"}
