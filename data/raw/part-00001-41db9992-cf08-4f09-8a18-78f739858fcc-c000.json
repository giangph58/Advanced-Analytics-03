Given the practical utility of using shared indexes, researchers\\nhave resorted to self-hosting these resources or performing ad hoc file\\ntransfers upon request, ultimately limiting the artifacts' discoverability and\\nreuse. This demonstration introduces a flexible and interoperable way to share\\nartifacts for Information Retrieval research, improving both their\\naccessibility and usability.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T17:23:32Z\"}"}
