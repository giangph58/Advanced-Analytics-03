Despite significant progress\\nin the field, implementing and using ZKPs via \\\\emph{ZKP circuits} remains\\nchallenging, leading to numerous bugs that affect ZKP circuits in practice, and\\n\\\\emph{fuzzing} remains largely unexplored as a method to detect bugs in ZKP\\ncircuits. We discuss the unique challenges of applying fuzzing to ZKP circuits,\\nexamine the oracle problem and its potential solutions, and propose techniques\\nfor input generation and test harness construction. We demonstrate that fuzzing\\ncan be effective in this domain by implementing a fuzzer for \\\\texttt{zk-regex},\\na cornerstone library in modern ZKP applications. In our case study, we\\ndiscovered \\\\textit{$10$} new bugs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T06:19:06Z\"}"}
