{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03362v1\", \"title\": \"3D Surface Reconstruction with Enhanced High-Frequency Details\", \"summary\": \"Neural implicit 3D reconstruction can reproduce shapes without 3D\\nsupervision, and it learns the 3D scene through volume rendering methods and\\nneural implicit representations. Current neural surface reconstruction methods\\ntend to randomly sample the entire image, making it difficult to learn\\nhigh-frequency details on the surface, and thus the reconstruction results tend\\nto be too smooth. We designed a method (FreNeuS) based on high-frequency\\ninformation to solve the problem of insufficient surface detail. Specifically,\\nFreNeuS uses pixel gradient changes to easily acquire high-frequency regions in\\nan image and uses the obtained high-frequency information to guide surface\\ndetail reconstruction. High-frequency information is first used to guide the\\ndynamic sampling of rays, applying different sampling strategies according to\\nvariations in high-frequency regions. To further enhance the focus on surface\\ndetails, we have designed a high-frequency weighting method that constrains the\\nrepresentation of high-frequency details during the reconstruction process.\\nQualitative and quantitative results show that our method can reconstruct fine\\nsurface details and obtain better surface reconstruction quality compared to\\nexisting methods. In addition, our method is more applicable and can be\\ngeneralized to any NeuS-based work.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T09:37:04Z\"}"}
