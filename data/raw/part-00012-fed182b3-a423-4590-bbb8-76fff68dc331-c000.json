Aiming at selecting important covariates while accounting for\\nmissing information in the response data, we apply the expectation-maximization\\nalgorithm to compute maximum likelihood estimators subject to LASSO\\npenalization. Subsequent to variable selection, we make inferences on the\\nselected covariate effects by extending post-selection inference methodology\\nbased on the polyhedral lemma. Empirical evidence from our extensive simulation\\nstudy suggests that our post-selection inference results are more reliable than\\nthose from naive inference methods that use the same data to perform variable\\nselection and inference without adjusting for variable selection.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T05:08:57Z\"}"}
