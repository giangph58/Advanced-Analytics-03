{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11193v1\", \"title\": \"Time-Resolved Stokes Analysis of Single Photon Emitters in Hexagonal\\n  Boron Nitride\", \"summary\": \"Solid-state quantum emitters play a vital role in advancing quantum\\ntechnologies, particularly in quantum computation and communication, where\\nsingle-photon polarization acts as a fundamental information carrier. Precise\\npolarization characterization is essential for understanding the mechanisms\\nunderlying polarization dynamics, which is critical for developing quantum\\nemitters with minimized polarization-related errors. In this study, we employ\\nthe Rotating Quarter-Wave Plate (RQWP) method to comprehensively characterize\\nthe polarization state of quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). By\\nexamining both time-averaged and dynamic polarization features, we demonstrate\\nthe time-resolved evolution of Stokes parameters from a solid-state\\nsingle-photon emitter using the RQWP technique. This approach provides more\\ncomplete polarization information than conventional micro-photoluminescence\\nmethods, without requiring modifications to the experimental setup. Our results\\nuncover intricate polarization dynamics in hBN emitters, offering insights that\\nwere previously inaccessible. The techniques presented here can be broadly\\napplied to polarization analysis of solid-state quantum emitters across various\\nmaterial platforms.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,cond-mat.mes-hall,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T13:49:14Z\"}"}
