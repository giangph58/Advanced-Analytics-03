{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11444v1\", \"title\": \"Fault Tolerant Quantum Simulation via Symplectic Transvections\", \"summary\": \"Conventional approaches to fault-tolerant quantum computing realize logical\\ncircuits gate-by-gate, synthesizing each gate independently on one or more code\\nblocks. This incurs excess overhead and doesn't leverage common structures in\\nquantum algorithms. In contrast, we propose a framework that enables the\\nexecution of entire logical circuit blocks at once, preserving their global\\nstructure. This whole-block approach allows for the direct implementation of\\nlogical Trotter circuits - of arbitrary rotation angles - on any stabilizer\\ncode, providing a powerful new method for fault tolerant Hamiltonian simulation\\nwithin a single code block. At the heart of our approach lies a deep structural\\ncorrespondence between symplectic transvections and Trotter circuits. This\\nconnection enables both logical and physical circuits to share the Trotter\\nstructure while preserving stabilizer centralization and circuit symmetry even\\nin the presence of non-Clifford rotations. We discuss potential approaches to\\nfault tolerance via biased noise and code concatenation. While we illustrate\\nthe key principles using a $[[8,3,3]]$ code, our simulations show that the\\nframework applies to Hamiltonian simulation on even good quantum LDPC codes.\\nThese results open the door to new algorithm-tailored, block-level strategies\\nfor fault tolerant circuit design, especially in quantum simulation.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T17:56:07Z\"}"}
