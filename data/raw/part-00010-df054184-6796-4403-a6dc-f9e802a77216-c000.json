The surface energy is calculated thermodynamically on the\\nsurface of a mathematical layer with no thickness. The surface energy concept\\nis certainly practical and elegant, but it doesn't seem entirely satisfactory\\nto us. In an earlier article 1 , we proposed a thought experiment in which\\nsurface tension is replaced with an equivalent force per unit area according to\\nthe principles of fluid mechanics. This theoretical tool can be used to rewrite\\nthe classical static equations in terms of surface stress gradient and propose\\na new way of calculating known phenomena such as meniscus, capillary tube,\\nwater drops, etc. In this article, we propose a new thought experiment assuming\\nthat beyond the classical interaction forces acting at short distance,\\nmolecules at liquid interfaces statistically reorganize according to a\\nstationary process of creation/destruction at long distance. The process is\\nsuch that the degree of statistical molecular organization decreases with a\\ngradient from the surface to the bulk, where the molecules recover the natural\\ndisorder of Brownian motion. Assuming that this reorganization process follows\\nan Avrami-type law, we will reinterpret the effects of surface tension in terms\\nof energy per unit volume, which will allow us to retrieve the previous\\nequations of force gradient per unit area.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T07:41:47Z\"}"}
