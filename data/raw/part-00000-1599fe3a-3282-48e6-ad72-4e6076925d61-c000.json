TNFs, owing to their subwavelength\\ndiameters and intense evanescent fields, offer a unique platform for enhanced\\nlight matter interactions at the nanoscale. However, their mechanical fragility\\nhas thus far hindered the integration of plasmonic structures using\\nconventional high energy deposition methods. BEBID addresses this limitation by\\ndeliberately defocusing the electron beam to reduce local mechanical stress,\\nminimize vibration, and prevent fiber damage during deposition, thereby\\nenabling the one-step growth of platinum nanopillars with sub 20 nm spatial\\nprecision and high structural fidelity directly on suspended TNFs. The\\nfabricated structures were characterized using SEM, EDX, and their optical\\nproperties were investigated through broadband scattering spectra and\\npolarization resolved measurements, showing strong agreement with Finite\\nDifference Time Domain (FDTD) simulations. Numerical modeling further reveals\\nthat ordered arrays of nanopillars can shape and direct the scattered field\\nalong the fiber axis, enabling directional emission. This work establishes\\nBEBID as a versatile bottom up nanofabrication approach for functional photonic\\narchitectures on fragile substrates, with direct applications in quantum\\nphotonics, nano optics, and on fiber plasmonic sensing.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T10:06:58Z\"}"}
