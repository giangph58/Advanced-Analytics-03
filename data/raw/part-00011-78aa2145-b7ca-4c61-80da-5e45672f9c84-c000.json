These include critical\\npoints that are not scale-invariant but rather exhibit hyperscaling violation.\\nAll of our examples are mildly non-Lagrangian, in that they arise from suitable\\n$N\\\\to 0$ limits of Carrollian theories with $N$-component fields, including\\nlimits of Carrollian vector models and non-abelian gauge theories. We discuss\\nimplications for flat space holography, highlighting challenges in realizing\\nCarrollian duals to gravitational theories.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T17:52:57Z\"}"}
