Utilizing the reductive perturbation\\nmethod and a specific transformation, we analyze the influence of different\\ntime-dependent linear potentials on these nonlinear wave structures. The\\nanalysis is conducted for three representative cases: (i) a constant potential,\\nwhich modifies the orientation and amplitude of breathers and positons, (ii) a\\nperiodically modulated potential, which transforms them into crescent-shaped\\nstructures with unique spatial characteristics, and (iii) an exponentially\\nvarying potential, which induces asymmetric crescent-shaped waveforms.\\nAdditionally, we show that linear potentials significantly influence breather\\nand positon dynamics in the modified electrical transmission line by altering\\ntheir position and positon amplitude-constant potentials maintain peaks at the\\norigin, periodic potentials shift breathers forward and positons backward,\\nwhile exponential potentials move breathers backward and positons forward. Our\\nfindings highlight the critical role of external modulation in shaping wave\\npropagation, localizing waves, and altering their amplitude, demonstrating its\\npotential for controlling wave dynamics in nonlinear transmission lines. Unlike\\nprevious studies that focused on rogue waves, this work provides new insights\\ninto the evolution of breathers and positons under external perturbations. The\\nresults may have significant implications for applications in electrical\\ntransmission networks.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.PS\", \"categories\": \"nlin.PS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T09:16:52Z\"}"}
