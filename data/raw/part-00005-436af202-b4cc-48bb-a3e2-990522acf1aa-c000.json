Since then, the Lindblad (GKLS) form of a\\nquantum master equation, its most general mathematical representation, became\\nan established staple in the open quantum systems toolbox. It allows to\\ndescribe a multitude of quantum phenomena, however, its universality comes at a\\ncost -- without additional constraints, the resultant dynamics are not\\nnecessarily thermodynamically consistent, and the equation itself lacks an\\nintuitive interpretation.\\n  We present a mathematically equivalent form of the Lindblad master equation\\nunder a single constraint of strict energy conservation. The ``elemental\\nBloch'' equation separates the system dynamics into its elemental parts, making\\nan explicit distinction between thermal mixing, dephasing, and energy\\nrelaxation, and thus reinstating the physical intuition in the equation. We\\nderive the equation for a many-level system by accounting for all relevant\\ntransitions between pairs of levels.\\n  Finally, the formalism is illustrated by calculating the fixed point of the\\ndynamics and exploring the conditions for canonical invariance in quantum\\nsystems.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:29:47Z\"}"}
