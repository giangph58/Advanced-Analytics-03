In this study, we propose a weak\\nsupervision framework that estimates parking lot occupancy using 3m resolution\\nsatellite imagery. By leveraging coarse temporal labels -- based on the\\nassumption that parking lots of major supermarkets and hardware stores in\\nGermany are typically full on Saturdays and empty on Sundays -- we train a\\npairwise comparison model that achieves an AUC of 0.92 on large parking lots.\\nThe proposed approach minimizes the reliance on expensive high-resolution\\nimages and holds promise for scalable urban mobility analysis. Moreover, the\\nmethod can be adapted to assess transit patterns and resource allocation in\\nvulnerable communities, providing a data-driven basis to improve the well-being\\nof those most in need.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:27:18Z\"}"}
