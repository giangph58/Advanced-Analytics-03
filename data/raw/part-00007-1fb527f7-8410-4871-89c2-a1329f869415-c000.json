{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02714v1\", \"title\": \"Impact of a Blockchain-based Universal Basic Income Pilot: The case of\\n  Circles UBI currency\", \"summary\": \"Circles UBI is a blockchain-based Community Currency System (CCS) that has\\nbeen active in Berlin (Germany) since October 2021. The Circles Coop, which\\nlaunched the project in 2021, was shut down in December 2023. In this paper, we\\nshow the results of a survey carried out between October and November 2023. The\\nrespondents were twenty-five individuals involved in various ways in the\\nCircles' network. The main emerging narrative points out how their\\nparticipation was deeply motivated by their identification with the values and\\nideals of the Circles community. Among them, we selected five profiles that\\nstood for their difference in type and degree of involvement. Finally, we\\nreport some stories of economic linkages that suggest a positive externality in\\nadopting a local community currency. To our knowledge, this is the first\\nqualitative study of a universal basic income designed as a community currency\\nand adopting blockchain technology. This pilot project was a remarkable\\nexperiment for its adopted advanced technological and social innovations. In\\nfact, as far as we know, the integration of basic income and local currency\\nfeatures has been experimented with only in two other cases (Maric\\\\'a, Brazil\\nand Barcelona, Spain) and none of them adopted a decentralized ledger system.\\nIn this work, we try to outline strengths and weaknesses that emerged after\\nabout two years of activity. For this reason, future researchers and activists\\ninterested in this field will find valuable information.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:53:37Z\"}"}
