{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11977v1\", \"title\": \"Leveraging Machine Learning Models to Predict the Outcome of Digital\\n  Medical Triage Interviews\", \"summary\": \"Many existing digital triage systems are questionnaire-based, guiding\\npatients to appropriate care levels based on information (e.g., symptoms,\\nmedical history, and urgency) provided by the patients answering\\nquestionnaires. Such a system often uses a deterministic model with predefined\\nrules to determine care levels. It faces challenges with incomplete triage\\ninterviews since it can only assist patients who finish the process. In this\\nstudy, we explore the use of machine learning (ML) to predict outcomes of\\nunfinished interviews, aiming to enhance patient care and service quality.\\nPredicting triage outcomes from incomplete data is crucial for patient safety\\nand healthcare efficiency. Our findings show that decision-tree models,\\nparticularly LGBMClassifier and CatBoostClassifier, achieve over 80\\\\% accuracy\\nin predicting outcomes from complete interviews while having a linear\\ncorrelation between the prediction accuracy and interview completeness degree.\\nFor example, LGBMClassifier achieves 88,2\\\\% prediction accuracy for interviews\\nwith 100\\\\% completeness, 79,6\\\\% accuracy for interviews with 80\\\\% completeness,\\n58,9\\\\% accuracy for 60\\\\% completeness, and 45,7\\\\% accuracy for 40\\\\%\\ncompleteness. The TabTransformer model demonstrated exceptional accuracy of\\nover 80\\\\% for all degrees of completeness but required extensive training time,\\nindicating a need for more powerful computational resources. The study\\nhighlights the linear correlation between interview completeness and predictive\\npower of the decision-tree models.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T11:17:23Z\"}"}
