The DM distribution is modeled via an empirical\\ndensity profile calibrated to observations of the elliptical galaxy NGC 4649\\n(M60), incorporating Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, stellar velocity\\ndispersion data, and globular cluster dynamics. The resultant spacetime metric\\ndepends on three independent parameters: the black hole mass $M$, the\\nasymptotic circular velocity $V_c$, and the halo scale radius $a$, and smoothly\\nreduces to the Schwarzschild limit as $V_c \\\\to 0$ and $a \\\\to 0$. We analyze the\\ninfluence of the halo on key geometric and physical quantities, including the\\nevent horizon radius, photon sphere, shadow size, and curvature invariants. The\\nKretschmann scalar exhibits an enhanced sensitivity to halo-induced\\nmodifications, particularly in the near-horizon regime. Thermodynamic\\nproperties of the solution are also examined. In the extremal limit,\\ncharacterized by a vanishing surface gravity, the model supports a finite\\ntangential pressure, implying a non-trivial extension of standard black hole\\nthermodynamics. These results highlight the relevance of incorporating\\nastrophysical environments into BH modeling and offer new avenues for testing\\nstrong-field gravity through precision observational data.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.HE,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:20:12Z\"}"}
