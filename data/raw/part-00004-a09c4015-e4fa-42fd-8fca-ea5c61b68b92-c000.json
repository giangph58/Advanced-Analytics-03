Using this result as a\\nprototypical example, we chart a course for the systematic study of\\nmulti-nucleon structure by building on techniques developed to optimise the\\ncomputation of the factorially increasing number of Wick contraction terms\\nrequired to calculate multi-nucleon matrix elements via lattice QCD.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-lat\", \"categories\": \"hep-lat\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T04:52:17Z\"}"}
