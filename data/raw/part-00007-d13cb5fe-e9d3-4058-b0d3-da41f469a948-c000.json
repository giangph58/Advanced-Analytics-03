{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11229v1\", \"title\": \"The Forward-Forward Algorithm: Characterizing Training Behavior\", \"summary\": \"The Forward-Forward algorithm is an alternative learning method which\\nconsists of two forward passes rather than a forward and backward pass employed\\nby backpropagation. Forward-Forward networks employ layer local loss functions\\nwhich are optimized based on the layer activation for each forward pass rather\\nthan a single global objective function. This work explores the dynamics of\\nmodel and layer accuracy changes in Forward-Forward networks as training\\nprogresses in pursuit of a mechanistic understanding of their internal\\nbehavior. Treatments to various system characteristics are applied to\\ninvestigate changes in layer and overall model accuracy as training progresses,\\nhow accuracy is impacted by layer depth, and how strongly individual layer\\naccuracy is correlated with overall model accuracy. The empirical results\\npresented suggest that layers deeper within Forward-Forward networks experience\\na delay in accuracy improvement relative to shallower layers and that shallower\\nlayer accuracy is strongly correlated with overall model accuracy.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:30:18Z\"}"}
