{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16703v1\", \"title\": \"Decidability Problems for Micro-Stipula\", \"summary\": \"Micro-Stipula is a stateful calculus in which clauses can be activated either\\nthrough interactions with the external environment or by the evaluation of time\\nexpressions. Despite the apparent simplicity of its syntax and operational\\nmodel, the combination of state evolution, time reasoning, and nondeterminism\\ngives rise to significant analytical challenges. In particular, we show that\\ndetermining whether a clause is never executed is undecidable. We formally\\nprove that this undecidability result holds even for syntactically restricted\\nfragments: namely, the time-ahead fragment, where all time expressions are\\nstrictly positive, and the instantaneous fragment, where all time expressions\\nevaluate to zero. On the other hand, we identify a decidable subfragment:\\nwithin the instantaneous fragment, reachability becomes decidable when the\\ninitial states of functions and events are disjoint.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LO\", \"categories\": \"cs.LO,cs.FL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T13:32:41Z\"}"}
