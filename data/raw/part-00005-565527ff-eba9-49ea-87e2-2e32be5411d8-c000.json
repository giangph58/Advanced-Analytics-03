{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20686v1\", \"title\": \"Inference of high-dimensional weak instrumental variable regression\\n  models without ridge-regularization\", \"summary\": \"Inference of instrumental variable regression models with many weak\\ninstruments attracts many attentions recently. To extend the classical\\nAnderson-Rubin test to high-dimensional setting, many procedures adopt\\nridge-regularization. However, we show that it is not necessary to consider\\nridge-regularization. Actually we propose a new quadratic-type test statistic\\nwhich does not involve tuning parameters. Our quadratic-type test exhibits high\\npower against dense alternatives. While for sparse alternatives, we derive the\\nasymptotic distribution of an existing maximum-type test, enabling the use of\\nless conservative critical values. To achieve strong performance across a wide\\nrange of scenarios, we further introduce a combined test procedure that\\nintegrates the strengths of both approaches. This combined procedure is\\npowerful without requiring prior knowledge of the underlying sparsity of the\\nfirst-stage model. Compared to existing methods, our proposed tests are easy to\\nimplement, free of tuning parameters, and robust to arbitrarily weak\\ninstruments as well as heteroskedastic errors. Simulation studies and empirical\\napplications demonstrate the advantages of our methods over existing\\napproaches.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T12:10:26Z\"}"}
