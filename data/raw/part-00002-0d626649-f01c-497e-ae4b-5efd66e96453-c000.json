{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04140v1\", \"title\": \"Disentangling Complex Systems: IdopNetwork Meets GLMY Homology Theory\", \"summary\": \"The study of complex systems has captured widespread attention in recent\\nyears, emphasizing the exploration of interactions and emergent properties\\namong system units. Network analysis based on graph theory has emerged as a\\npowerful approach for analyzing network topology and functions, making them\\nwidely adopted in complex systems. IdopNetwork is an advanced statistical\\nphysics framework that constructs the interaction within complex systems by\\nintegrating large-scale omics data. By combining GLMY theory, the structural\\ncharacteristics of the network topology can be traced, providing deeper\\ninsights into the dynamic evolution of the network. This combination not only\\noffers a novel perspective for dissecting the internal regulation of complex\\nsystems from a holistic standpoint but also provides significant support for\\napplied fields such as data science, complex disease, and materials science.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T05:38:03Z\"}"}
