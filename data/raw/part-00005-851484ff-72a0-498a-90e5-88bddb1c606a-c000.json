Existing\\nsolutions often rely on a pre-alignment strategy to normalize data, which can\\ndistort intrinsic patterns and escalate computational and memory demands.\\nAddressing these limitations, we introduce STRGCN, a Spatio-Temporal Relational\\nGraph Convolutional Network that avoids pre-alignment and directly captures the\\ncomplex interdependencies in IMTS by representing them as a fully connected\\ngraph. Each observation is represented as a node, allowing the model to\\neffectively handle misaligned timestamps by mapping all inter-node\\nrelationships, thus faithfully preserving the asynchronous nature of the data.\\nMoreover, we enhance this model with a hierarchical ``Sandwich'' structure that\\nstrategically aggregates nodes to optimize graph embeddings, reducing\\ncomputational overhead while maintaining detailed local and global context.\\nExtensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that STRGCN achieves\\nstate-of-the-art accuracy, competitive memory usage and training speed.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T06:41:33Z\"}"}
