[8] generalized graphic matroids to\\nhypergraphic matroids. In [8], the authors introduced hypertrees as a\\ngeneralization of spanning trees and proved a form of the theorem of Tutte [18]\\nand Nash-Williams [14]. In [3, 15, 17], the authors explored the modulus of the\\nfamily of spanning trees in graphs and of the family of bases of matroids, and\\nprovided connections to the notions of strength and fractional arboricity. They\\nalso established Fulkerson duality for these families. In this paper, we extend\\nthese results to hypertrees, and show that the modulus of hypertrees uncovers a\\nhierarchical structure within arbitrary hypergraphs.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T05:38:09Z\"}"}
