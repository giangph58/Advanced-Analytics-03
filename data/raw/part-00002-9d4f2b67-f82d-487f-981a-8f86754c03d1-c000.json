As research\\ninterest and investment grow, the SSL design space continues to expand. The\\nPlatonic view of SSL, following the Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH),\\nsuggests that despite different methods and engineering approaches, all\\nrepresentations converge to the same Platonic ideal. However, this phenomenon\\nlacks precise theoretical explanation. By synthesizing evidence from\\nIdentifiability Theory (IT), we show that the PRH can emerge in SSL. However,\\ncurrent IT cannot explain SSL's empirical success. To bridge the gap between\\ntheory and practice, we propose expanding IT into what we term Singular\\nIdentifiability Theory (SITh), a broader theoretical framework encompassing the\\nentire SSL pipeline. SITh would allow deeper insights into the implicit data\\nassumptions in SSL and advance the field towards learning more interpretable\\nand generalizable representations. We highlight three critical directions for\\nfuture research: 1) training dynamics and convergence properties of SSL; 2) the\\nimpact of finite samples, batch size, and data diversity; and 3) the role of\\ninductive biases in architecture, augmentations, initialization schemes, and\\noptimizers.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:10:33Z\"}"}
