We\\npresent a distributed primal-dual accelerated mirror-descent algorithm that\\nguarantees convergence. However, we demonstrate that this time-varying\\nalgorithm is not robust, as it fails to converge under even the slightest\\ndisturbances. To address this limitation, we introduce a distributed\\naccelerated algorithm that employs a coordinated restarting mechanism. We model\\nthis new algorithm as a hybrid dynamical system and establish that it possesses\\nstructural robustness.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:56:39Z\"}"}
