{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10258v1\", \"title\": \"XY-Cut++: Advanced Layout Ordering via Hierarchical Mask Mechanism on a\\n  Novel Benchmark\", \"summary\": \"Document Reading Order Recovery is a fundamental task in document image\\nunderstanding, playing a pivotal role in enhancing Retrieval-Augmented\\nGeneration (RAG) and serving as a critical preprocessing step for large\\nlanguage models (LLMs). Existing methods often struggle with complex\\nlayouts(e.g., multi-column newspapers), high-overhead interactions between\\ncross-modal elements (visual regions and textual semantics), and a lack of\\nrobust evaluation benchmarks. We introduce XY-Cut++, an advanced layout\\nordering method that integrates pre-mask processing, multi-granularity\\nsegmentation, and cross-modal matching to address these challenges. Our method\\nsignificantly enhances layout ordering accuracy compared to traditional XY-Cut\\ntechniques. Specifically, XY-Cut++ achieves state-of-the-art performance (98.8\\nBLEU overall) while maintaining simplicity and efficiency. It outperforms\\nexisting baselines by up to 24\\\\% and demonstrates consistent accuracy across\\nsimple and complex layouts on the newly introduced DocBench-100 dataset. This\\nadvancement establishes a reliable foundation for document structure recovery,\\nsetting a new standard for layout ordering tasks and facilitating more\\neffective RAG and LLM preprocessing.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.MM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T14:19:57Z\"}"}
