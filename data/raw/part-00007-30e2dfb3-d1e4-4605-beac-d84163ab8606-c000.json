Our approach leverages bilingual data during training, employing\\nnegative sampling and a margin-based retrieval objective. We demonstrate that a\\ndimension-as-token self-attention mechanism designed with significantly reduced\\ninternal dimensions can effectively encode sentence embeddings for subject\\nretrieval. In quantitative evaluation, our system achieved an average recall\\nrate of 32.24% in the general quantitative setting (all subjects), 43.16% and\\n31.53% of the general qualitative evaluation methods with minimal GPU usage,\\nhighlighting their competitive performance. Our results demonstrate that our\\napproach is effective in capturing relevant subject information under resource\\nconstraints, although there is still room for improvement.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T17:33:46Z\"}"}
