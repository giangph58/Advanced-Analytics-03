{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04755v1\", \"title\": \"Effects of Surface Corrugation on Gas-Surface Scattering and Macroscopic\\n  Flows\", \"summary\": \"Gas-surface scattering exhibits a transition from thermal to structure\\nscattering regime as incident energy increases, characterized by changes in\\nangular and energy distributions. Capturing scattering behavior across\\ndifferent regimes is essential for modeling momentum and energy exchange at the\\ngas-surface interface. This study presents a corrugated Cercignani-Lampis-Lord\\n(CLL) model to account for surface corrugation in scattering. It extends the\\nwashboard-CLL hybrid approach by incorporating tangential momentum\\naccommodation in local collisions. The model is validated against molecular\\nbeam scattering experiments, focusing on its ability to reproduce the variation\\nin scattering behavior with increasing incident energy. Compared to the\\nconventional CLL model, the proposed model qualitatively improves the\\nrepresentation of key features across the scattering regimes. In particular, it\\ncaptures broader angular distributions and increasing reflected energy with\\nreflected angle at higher incident energy. It is further applied to Direct\\nSimulation Monte-Carlo (DSMC) analysis of rarefied flows over a cylinder and\\nwithin an intake to examine the influence of surface corrugation on macroscopic\\nflow behavior. The results show that surface corrugation has limited impact on\\ntotal drag, while decreasing pressure drag and increasing friction drag. In the\\nintake, enhanced tangential accommodation reduces capture efficiency and\\nincreases compression ratio. These findings highlight the importance of\\nincorporating surface corrugation in rarefied flow simulations under VLEO\\nconditions.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T06:08:13Z\"}"}
