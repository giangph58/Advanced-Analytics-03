{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05083v1\", \"title\": \"Hybrid Personalization Using Declarative and Procedural Memory Modules\\n  of the Cognitive Architecture ACT-R\", \"summary\": \"Recommender systems often rely on sub-symbolic machine learning approaches\\nthat operate as opaque black boxes. These approaches typically fail to account\\nfor the cognitive processes that shape user preferences and decision-making. In\\nthis vision paper, we propose a hybrid user modeling framework based on the\\ncognitive architecture ACT-R that integrates symbolic and sub-symbolic\\nrepresentations of human memory. Our goal is to combine ACT-R's declarative\\nmemory, which is responsible for storing symbolic chunks along sub-symbolic\\nactivations, with its procedural memory, which contains symbolic production\\nrules. This integration will help simulate how users retrieve past experiences\\nand apply decision-making strategies. With this approach, we aim to provide\\nmore transparent recommendations, enable rule-based explanations, and\\nfacilitate the modeling of cognitive biases. We argue that our approach has the\\npotential to inform the design of a new generation of human-centered,\\npsychology-informed recommender systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T09:32:04Z\"}"}
