{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15560v1\", \"title\": \"Antenna Technology Readiness for the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) Mission\", \"summary\": \"The Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) will be the first sub-mm wavelength Space\\nVery-Long-Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) mission. It targets astronomical\\nimaging with the highest ever spatial resolution to enable detection of the\\nphoton ring of a supermassive black hole. BHEX is being proposed for launch in\\n2031 as a NASA Small Explorers mission. BHEX science goals and mission\\nopportunity require a high precision lightweight spaceborne antenna. A survey\\nof the technology landscape for realizing such an antenna is presented.\\nTechnology readiness (TRL) for the antenna is discussed and assessed to be at\\nTRL 5. An update on our technology maturation efforts is provided. Design\\nstudies leading to the conceptual design of a metallized carbon fiber\\nreinforced plastic (CFRP) technology based antenna with a mass of only $\\\\dim\\n50$ kg, incorporating a 3.4 m primary reflector with a surface precision of <\\n40 $\\\\mu$m to allow efficient operation up to 320 GHz are outlined. Current\\nplans anticipate attaining TRL6 in 2026 for the BHEX antenna. Completed design\\nstudies point to a large margin in surface precision which opens up\\nopportunities for applications beyond BHEX, at significantly higher THz\\nfrequencies.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T03:30:32Z\"}"}
