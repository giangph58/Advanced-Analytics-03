Using near-forward\\nRaman scattering, the PP of the cubic Zn(1-x)MgxTe (x<0.09) semiconductor alloy\\ncould be measured. While the PP-coupling hardly develops in pure ZnTe, minor\\nMg-alloying suffices to stabilize a long-lifetime PP strongly bound to the\\nlattice, i.e., with a pronounced phonon character, and yet a fast one\\noriginating from the highly dispersive photon-like bottleneck of the\\nPP-dispersion. By combining the advantages of a phonon and of a photon, the\\nlong-lifetime PP generated by minor Mg-alloying of ZnTe marks an improvement\\nover the PP of pristine ZnTe, that, from the Raman cross section calculation,\\ncan only achieve a balanced compromise between the two kinds of advantages,\\nintensity and speed. The discussion of the PP-related lattice dynamics of\\nZn(1-x)MgxTe (x<0.09) is grounded in a preliminary study of the lattice macro-\\nand microstructure using X-ray diffraction and solid-state nuclear magnetic\\nresonance, respectively, and further relies on ab initio calculations of the\\nnative phonon modes behind the PP in the Mg-dilute limit of Zn(1-x)MgxTe (x~0),\\nconsidering various Mg-isotopes.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.other,J.2\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T08:38:23Z\"}"}
