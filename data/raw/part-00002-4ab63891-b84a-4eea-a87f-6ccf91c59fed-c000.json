{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12881v1\", \"title\": \"Photoinduced magnetic phase transitions in the cubic Kondo-lattice model\", \"summary\": \"We theoretically study photoinduced magnetic phase transitions and their\\ndynamical processes in the Kondo-lattice model on a cubic lattice. It is\\ndemonstrated that light irradiation gives rise to magnetic phase transitions\\nfrom the ground-state ferromagnetic state to a three-dimensional\\nantiferromagnetic state as a nonequilibrium steady state in the photodriven\\nsystem. This phase transition occurs as a consequence of the formation of\\npseudo half-filling band occupation via the photoexcitation and relaxation of\\nelectrons, where all the electron states constituting the lower band separated\\nfrom the upper band by an exchange gap are partially but nearly uniformly\\noccupied. We also find that several types of antiferromagnetic correlations,\\ne.g., A-type and C-type antiferromagnetic correlations, appear in a transient\\nstate of the dynamical phase transition. By calculating magnon spectra for the\\nphotodriven system, we argue that the instability to the A-type or C-type\\nantiferromagnetic state occurs in the ferromagnetic ground state as a softening\\nof the magnon band dispersion at corresponding momentum points depending on the\\nlight polarization. Our findings provide important insights into the\\nunderstanding of photoinduced magnetic phase transitions in the\\nthree-dimensional Kondo-lattice magnets.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T12:14:20Z\"}"}
