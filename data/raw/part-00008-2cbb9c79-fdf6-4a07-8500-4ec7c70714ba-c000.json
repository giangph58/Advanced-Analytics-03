{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17387v1\", \"title\": \"Graph covers and semi-covers: Who is stronger?\", \"summary\": \"The notion of graph cover, also known as locally bijective homomorphism, is a\\ndiscretization of covering spaces known from general topology. It is a pair of\\nincidence-preserving vertex- and edge-mappings between two graphs, the\\nedge-component being bijective on the edge-neighborhoods of every vertex and\\nits image. In line with the current trends in topological graph theory and its\\napplications in mathematical physics, graphs are considered in the most relaxed\\nform and as such they may contain multiple edges, loops and semi-edges.\\n  Nevertheless, simple graphs (binary structures without multiple edges, loops,\\nor semi-edges) play an important role. It has been conjectured in [Bok et al.:\\nList covering of regular multigraphs, Proceedings IWOCA 2022, LNCS 13270, pp.\\n228--242] that for every fixed graph $H$, deciding if a graph covers $H$ is\\neither polynomial time solvable for arbitrary input graphs, or NP-complete for\\nsimple ones. A graph $A$ is called stronger than a graph $B$ if every simple\\ngraph that covers $A$ also covers $B$. This notion was defined and found useful\\nfor NP-hardness reductions for disconnected graphs in [Bok et al.:\\nComputational complexity of covering disconnected multigraphs, Proceedings FCT\\n2022, LNCS 12867, pp. 85--99]. It was conjectured in [Kratochv\\\\'{\\\\i}l: Towards\\nstrong dichotomy of graphs covers, GROW 2022 - Book of open problems, p. 10,\\n{\\\\tt https://grow.famnit.upr.si/GROW-BOP.pdf}] that if $A$ has no semi-edges,\\nthen $A$ is stronger than $B$ if and only if $A$ covers $B$. We prove this\\nconjecture for cubic one-vertex graphs, and we also justify it for all cubic\\ngraphs $A$ with at most 4 vertices.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,G.2.2\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T09:13:18Z\"}"}
