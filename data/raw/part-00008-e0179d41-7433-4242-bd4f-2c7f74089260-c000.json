{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04553v1\", \"title\": \"Risk-sensitive Reinforcement Learning Based on Convex Scoring Functions\", \"summary\": \"We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework under a broad class of\\nrisk objectives, characterized by convex scoring functions. This class covers\\nmany common risk measures, such as variance, Expected Shortfall, entropic\\nValue-at-Risk, and mean-risk utility. To resolve the time-inconsistency issue,\\nwe consider an augmented state space and an auxiliary variable and recast the\\nproblem as a two-state optimization problem. We propose a customized\\nActor-Critic algorithm and establish some theoretical approximation guarantees.\\nA key theoretical contribution is that our results do not require the Markov\\ndecision process to be continuous. Additionally, we propose an auxiliary\\nvariable sampling method inspired by the alternating minimization algorithm,\\nwhich is convergent under certain conditions. We validate our approach in\\nsimulation experiments with a financial application in statistical arbitrage\\ntrading, demonstrating the effectiveness of the algorithm.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.MF\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.MF,cs.AI,q-fin.RM\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T16:31:42Z\"}"}
