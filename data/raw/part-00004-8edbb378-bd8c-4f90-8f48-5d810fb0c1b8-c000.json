Using the {\\\\it\\nJames Webb} Space Telescope (JWST) in combination with the {\\\\it Hubble} Space\\nTelescope (HST), we outline here an analytical framework that is applied to the\\nWarhol arc (at $z=0.94$) in the MACS 0416 galaxy cluster (at $z=0.396)$ where\\nover a dozen microlensed stars have been detected to date. This method is\\ngeneral and can be applied to other lensed arcs. Within this lensed galaxy we\\nfit the spatially resolved SED spanned by eight JWST-NIRCam filters combined\\nwith three ACS filters, for accurate lensed star predictions in 2D. With this\\ntool we can generate 2D maps of microlensed stars for well resolved arcs in\\ngeneral, including dependence on wavelength and limiting apparent magnitude,\\nfor comparison with with planned cadenced campaigns for JWST and Hubble, for\\nconstraining directly the IMF and the level of dark matter substructure.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T16:54:22Z\"}"}
