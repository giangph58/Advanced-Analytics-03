{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17493v1\", \"title\": \"Goal-Oriented Time-Series Forecasting: Foundation Framework Design\", \"summary\": \"Traditional time-series forecasting often focuses only on minimizing\\nprediction errors, ignoring the specific requirements of real-world\\napplications that employ them. This paper presents a new training methodology,\\nwhich allows a forecasting model to dynamically adjust its focus based on the\\nimportance of forecast ranges specified by the end application. Unlike previous\\nmethods that fix these ranges beforehand, our training approach breaks down\\npredictions over the entire signal range into smaller segments, which are then\\ndynamically weighted and combined to produce accurate forecasts. We tested our\\nmethod on standard datasets, including a new dataset from wireless\\ncommunication, and found that not only it improves prediction accuracy but also\\nimproves the performance of end application employing the forecasting model.\\nThis research provides a basis for creating forecasting systems that better\\nconnect prediction and decision-making in various practical applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T12:34:43Z\"}"}
