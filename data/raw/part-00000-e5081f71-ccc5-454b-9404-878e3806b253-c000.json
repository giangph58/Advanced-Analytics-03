{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10892v1\", \"title\": \"Multiple points of view: The simultaneous crossing number for knots with\\n  doubly transvergent diagrams\", \"summary\": \"The simultaneous crossing number is a new knot invariant which is defined for\\nstrongly invertible knots having diagrams with two orthogonal transvergent axes\\nof strong inversions. Because the composition of the two inversions gives a\\ncyclic period of order 2 with an axis orthogonal to the two axes of strong\\ninversion, knot diagrams with this property have three characteristic\\northogonal directions. We define the simultaneous crossing number,\\n$\\\\operatorname{sim}(K)$, as the minimum of the sum of the numbers of crossings\\nof projections in the 3 directions, where the minimum is taken over all\\nembeddings of $K$ satisfying the symmetry condition. Dividing the simultaneous\\ncrossing number by the usual crossing number, $\\\\operatorname{cr}(K)$, of a knot\\ngives a number $\\\\ge 3$, because each of the 3 diagrams is a knot diagram of the\\nknot in question. We show that $\\\\liminf_{\\\\operatorname{cr}(K) \\\\to \\\\infty}\\n\\\\operatorname{sim}(K)/\\\\operatorname{cr}(K) \\\\le 8$, when the minimum over all\\nknots and the limit over increasing crossing numbers is considered.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GT\", \"categories\": \"math.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T06:05:41Z\"}"}
