In literature, the model was extended to represent the effects of\\ninflation and also the speculative money flow. Based on the inflationary model,\\nwe take into account a time delay in the inflation term which stands for the\\nperiod before the effects of inflation are seen. We observe that, the delayed\\nsystem may experience a Hopf bifurcation and exhibit cyclic behavior around an\\nequilibrium point, although the non-delayed model is stable under the same\\nconditions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T12:05:27Z\"}"}
