This paper introduces BCause, a\\ndiscussion system leveraging generative AI and human-machine collaboration to\\ntransform unstructured dialogue around public issues (such as urban living,\\npolicy changes, and current socio-economic transformations) into structured,\\nactionable democratic processes. We present three innovations: (i) importing\\nand transforming unstructured transcripts into argumentative discussions, (ii)\\ngeo-deliberated problem-sensing via a Telegram bot for local issue reporting,\\nand (iii) smart reporting with customizable widgets (e.g., summaries, topic\\nmodelling, policy recommendations, clustered arguments). The system's human-AI\\npartnership preserves critical human participation to ensure ethical oversight,\\ncontextual relevance, and creative synthesis.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.AI,cs.CY,I.2\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T14:43:49Z\"}"}
