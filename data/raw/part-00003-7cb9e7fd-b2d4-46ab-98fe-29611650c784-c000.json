While\\nclassical Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are renowned for their scalability and\\nrobustness, existing QGNNs often lack flexibility due to graph-specific quantum\\ncircuit designs, limiting their applicability to a narrower range of\\ngraph-structured problems, falling short of real-world scenarios. To address\\nthese limitations, we propose a versatile QGNN framework inspired by the\\nclassical GraphSAGE approach, utilizing quantum models as aggregators. In this\\nwork, we integrate established techniques for inductive representation learning\\non graphs with parametrized quantum convolutional and pooling layers,\\neffectively bridging classical and quantum paradigms. The convolutional layer\\nis flexible, enabling tailored designs for specific problems. Benchmarked on a\\nnode regression task with the QM9 dataset, we demonstrate that our framework\\nsuccessfully models a non-trivial molecular dataset, achieving performance\\ncomparable to classical GNNs. In particular, we show that our quantum approach\\nexhibits robust generalization across molecules with varying numbers of atoms\\nwithout requiring circuit modifications, slightly outperforming classical GNNs.\\nFurthermore, we numerically investigate the scalability of the QGNN framework.\\nSpecifically, we demonstrate the absence of barren plateaus in our architecture\\nas the number of qubits increases, suggesting that the proposed quantum model\\ncan be extended to handle larger and more complex graph-based problems\\neffectively.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:04:08Z\"}"}
