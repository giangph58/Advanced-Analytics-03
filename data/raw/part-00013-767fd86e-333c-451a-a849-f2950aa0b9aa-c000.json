{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15802v1\", \"title\": \"Cosmic ray neutrons in magnetized astrophysical structures\", \"summary\": \"Cosmic rays are often modeled as charged particles. This allows their\\nnon-ballistic propagation in magnetized structures to be captured. In certain\\nsituations, a neutral cosmic ray component can arise. For example, cosmic ray\\nneutrons are produced in considerable numbers through hadronic pp and p$\\\\gamma$\\ninteractions. At ultrahigh energies, the decay timescales of these neutrons is\\ndilated, allowing them to traverse distances on the scale of galactic and\\ncosmological structures. Unlike charged cosmic rays, neutrons are not deflected\\nby magnetic fields. They propagate ballistically at the speed of light in\\nstraight lines. The presence of a neutral baryonic cosmic ray component formed\\nin galaxies, clusters and cosmological filaments can facilitate the escape and\\nleakage of cosmic rays from magnetic structures that would otherwise confine\\nthem. We show that, by allowing confinement breaking, the formation of\\ncosmic-ray neutrons by high-energy hadronic interactions in large scale\\nastrophysical structures can modify the exchange of ultra high-energy particles\\nacross magnetic interfaces between galaxies, clusters, cosmological filaments\\nand voids.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T11:33:57Z\"}"}
