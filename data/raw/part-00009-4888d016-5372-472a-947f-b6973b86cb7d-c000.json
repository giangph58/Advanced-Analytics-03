{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05011v1\", \"title\": \"Reality-infused Deep Learning Framework via Angle-resolved Metasurfaces\", \"summary\": \"Metasurfaces and optical Fourier surfaces (OFSs), featuring patterned\\nnanostructures and profiled diffractive elements, offer versatile platforms for\\nlight field manipulation. Compared to tuning structural parameters, adjusting\\nincident light angles provides greater design flexibility. However,\\nangle-resolved light behaviors are often complex due to diverse mode\\nexcitations and couplings, posing challenges for simulations and\\nnanofabrication. Here, we present a reality-infused deep learning framework\\naugmented by angle-resolved measuring technology, enabling precise and\\nreal-time predictions of angular dispersion characteristics for metasurfaces\\nand OFSs. This approach captures critical fabrication and measurement\\nimperfections typically missed by conventional simulations. We demonstrate a\\n900-fold acceleration in the design process and accomplish near-perfect\\nprediction consistency to experimental results, with an impressive accuracy up\\nto 99.8%. Our study not only supports valuable insights into the development of\\nmeta-devices but also represents a paradigm shift from simulation-driven to\\nreality-infused methods, paving the way for advancements in extensive optical\\ndesign applications.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T07:31:25Z\"}"}
