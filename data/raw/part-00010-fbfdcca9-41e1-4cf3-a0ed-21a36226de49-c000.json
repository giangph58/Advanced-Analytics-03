That is, U-Net inference can be performed solely using\\nhomomorphic encryption techniques. To our knowledge, this is the first work to\\nachieve support perform implement enable U-Net inference entirely based on\\nhomomorphic encryption ?.\\n  The primary technical challenge lies in data encoding. To address this, we\\nemploy a flexible encoding scheme, termed Double Volley Revolver, which enables\\neffective support for skip connections and upsampling operations within the\\nU-Net architecture.\\n  We adopt a tailored HE-friendly U-Net design incorporating square activation\\nfunctions, mean pooling layers, and transposed convolution layers (implemented\\nas ConvTranspose2d in PyTorch) with a kernel size of 2 and stride of 2. After\\ntraining the model in plaintext, we deploy the resulting parameters using the\\nHEAAN homomorphic encryption library to perform encrypted U-Net inference.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T11:37:22Z\"}"}
