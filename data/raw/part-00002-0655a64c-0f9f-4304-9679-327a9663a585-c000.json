Still, existing deep learning-based methods often\\nrequire significant computational costs to generate diverse stylized results.\\nMotivated by this, we propose a novel reinforcement learning-based framework\\nfor arbitrary style transfer RLMiniStyler. This framework leverages a unified\\nreinforcement learning policy to iteratively guide the style transfer process\\nby exploring and exploiting stylization feedback, generating smooth sequences\\nof stylized results while achieving model lightweight. Furthermore, we\\nintroduce an uncertainty-aware multi-task learning strategy that automatically\\nadjusts loss weights to adapt to the content and style balance requirements at\\ndifferent training stages, thereby accelerating model convergence. Through a\\nseries of experiments across image various resolutions, we have validated the\\nadvantages of RLMiniStyler over other state-of-the-art methods in generating\\nhigh-quality, diverse artistic image sequences at a lower cost.
