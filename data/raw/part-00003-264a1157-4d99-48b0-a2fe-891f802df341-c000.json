{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20983v1\", \"title\": \"LTLf Adaptive Synthesis for Multi-Tier Goals in Nondeterministic Domains\", \"summary\": \"We study a variant of LTLf synthesis that synthesizes adaptive strategies for\\nachieving a multi-tier goal, consisting of multiple increasingly challenging\\nLTLf objectives in nondeterministic planning domains. Adaptive strategies are\\nstrategies that at any point of their execution (i) enforce the satisfaction of\\nas many objectives as possible in the multi-tier goal, and (ii) exploit\\npossible cooperation from the environment to satisfy as many as possible of the\\nremaining ones. This happens dynamically: if the environment cooperates (ii)\\nand an objective becomes enforceable (i), then our strategies will enforce it.\\nWe provide a game-theoretic technique to compute adaptive strategies that is\\nsound and complete. Notably, our technique is polynomial, in fact quadratic, in\\nthe number of objectives. In other words, it handles multi-tier goals with only\\na minor overhead compared to standard LTLf synthesis.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:53:16Z\"}"}
