The non-negative weights\\nneed only be $L^\\\\infty$ convergent to a bounded and uniformly continuous limit.\\nWe apply the BBM formula to show a Poincar\\\\'e-type inequality and the stability\\nof the first eigenvalues relative to the energies. Finally, we discuss a\\nnon-local analogue of the weighted BBM formula.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T09:48:20Z\"}"}
