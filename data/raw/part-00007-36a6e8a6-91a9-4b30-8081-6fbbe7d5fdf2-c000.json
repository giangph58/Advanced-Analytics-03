Early identification is necessary to prompt intervention, but it\\nremains a challenging task. This study aims to address this challenge by\\ncombining joint graph learning with network analysis. Motivated by this\\ndiscovery, we develop a Conjoint Graph Representation Learning (CGRL) framework\\nthat: a) constructs two networks based on disease coding, including the patient\\nnetwork and the disease difference network. Three comorbidity network features\\nwere generated based on the basic difference network to capture the potential\\nrelationship between comorbidities and risk diseases; b) incorporates\\ncomputational structure intervention and learning feature representation, CGRL\\nwas developed to predict the risks of diabetes and coronary heart disease in\\npatients; and c) analysis the comorbidity patterns and exploring the pathways\\nof disease progression, the pathological pathogenesis of diabetes and coronary\\nheart disease may be revealed. The results show that the network features\\nextracted based on the difference network are important, and the framework we\\nproposed provides more accurate predictions than other strong models in terms\\nof accuracy.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T09:47:51Z\"}"}
