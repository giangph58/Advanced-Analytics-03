A Review of 12 Years of Research at the Frontier of\\n  Human Computation and Crowdsourcing\", \"summary\": \"The field of human computation and crowdsourcing has historically studied how\\ntasks can be outsourced to humans. However, many tasks previously distributed\\nto human crowds can today be completed by generative AI with human-level\\nabilities, and concerns about crowdworkers increasingly using language models\\nto complete tasks are surfacing. These developments undermine core premises of\\nthe field. In this paper, we examine the evolution of the Conference on Human\\nComputation and Crowdsourcing (HCOMP) - a representative example of the field\\nas one of its key venues - through the lens of Kuhn's paradigm shifts. We\\nreview 12 years of research at HCOMP, mapping the evolution of HCOMP's research\\ntopics and identifying significant shifts over time. Reflecting on the findings\\nthrough the lens of Kuhn's paradigm shifts, we suggest that these shifts do not\\nconstitute a paradigm shift. Ultimately, our analysis of gradual topic shifts\\nover time, combined with data on the evident overlap with related venues,\\ncontributes a data-driven perspective to the broader discussion about the\\nfuture of HCOMP and the field as a whole.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T04:51:57Z\"}"}
