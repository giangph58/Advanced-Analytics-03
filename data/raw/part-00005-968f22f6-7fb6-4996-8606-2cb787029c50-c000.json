{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02674v1\", \"title\": \"Limitations of Religious Data and the Importance of the Target Domain:\\n  Towards Machine Translation for Guinea-Bissau Creole\", \"summary\": \"We introduce a new dataset for machine translation of Guinea-Bissau Creole\\n(Kiriol), comprising around 40 thousand parallel sentences to English and\\nPortuguese. This dataset is made up of predominantly religious data (from the\\nBible and texts from the Jehovah's Witnesses), but also a small amount of\\ngeneral domain data (from a dictionary). This mirrors the typical resource\\navailability of many low resource languages. We train a number of\\ntransformer-based models to investigate how to improve domain transfer from\\nreligious data to a more general domain. We find that adding even 300 sentences\\nfrom the target domain when training substantially improves the translation\\nperformance, highlighting the importance and need for data collection for\\nlow-resource languages, even on a small-scale. We additionally find that\\nPortuguese-to-Kiriol translation models perform better on average than other\\nsource and target language pairs, and investigate how this relates to the\\nmorphological complexity of the languages involved and the degree of lexical\\noverlap between creoles and lexifiers. Overall, we hope our work will stimulate\\nresearch into Kiriol and into how machine translation might better support\\ncreole languages in general.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:14:19Z\"}"}
