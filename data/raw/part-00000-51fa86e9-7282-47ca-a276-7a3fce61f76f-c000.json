In this\\nwork, we demonstrate that flavin-based cryptochrome proteins, which generate\\nradical pairs upon optical excitation, also exhibit optically detected magnetic\\nresonance. We further show that this optical spin interface is tunable by the\\nprotein structure. These findings establish radical pairs in proteins as a\\nnovel platform for optically addressable spin systems and magnetic field\\nsensors. Additionally, the ability to control spin transitions introduces a new\\nclass of biophysical tools that hold promise for enabling multiplexed\\nfluorescence microscopy. Importantly, due to the spin-selective nature of\\nradical pair chemistry, the results lay the groundwork for radiofrequency-based\\nmanipulation of biological systems.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T09:45:30Z\"}"}
