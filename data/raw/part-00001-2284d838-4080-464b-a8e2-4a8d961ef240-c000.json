{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05105v1\", \"title\": \"Brezis-Nirenberg type problems associated with nonlinear superposition\\n  operators of mixed fractional order\", \"summary\": \"This paper aims to study the Brezis-Nirenberg type problem driven by the\\nnonlinear superposition of operators of the form $$A_{\\\\mu,\\np}u:=\\\\int_{[0,1]}(-\\\\Delta)_{p}^{s} u\\\\,\\\\, d \\\\mu(s),$$ where $\\\\mu$ denotes the\\nsigned measure over $[0, 1]$.\\n  We consider nonlinear nonlocal equations associated with $A_{\\\\mu, p}$,\\ninvolving critical nonlinearity and lower-order perturbation. Using variational\\ntechniques, we establish existence results for the critical problem by\\nemploying weak lower semicontinuity arguments under general assumptions on the\\nperturbation term. We discuss the multiplicity results when the perturbation\\nterm vanishes at the origin. Additionally, when the lower-order term is a pure\\npower function, we examine the Brezis-Nirenberg-type problem using the mountain\\npass technique. Furthermore, we address the existence of solutions to\\nsubcritical problems associated with $A_{\\\\mu, p}.$\\n  Our findings are novel, even in the case of the sum of two distinct\\nfractional $p$-Laplacians or a combination of a fractional $p$-Laplacian with a\\nclassical $p$-Laplacian. More generally, our framework is sufficiently broad to\\naccommodate finite sums of different fractional $p$-Laplacians as well as cases\\ninvolving fractional Laplacians with ``wrong\\\" signs.\\n  A key contribution of this study is the development of a unified approach\\nthat systematically addresses these problems by incorporating a broad class of\\noperators and lower-order perturbation terms within a common theoretical\\nframework. The results remain new even in the case of linear superposition of\\nfractional operators of different orders.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:12:36Z\"}"}
