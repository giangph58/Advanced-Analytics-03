{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15156v1\", \"title\": \"Advanced posterior analyses of hidden Markov models: finite Markov chain\\n  imbedding and hybrid decoding\", \"summary\": \"Two major tasks in applications of hidden Markov models are to (i) compute\\ndistributions of summary statistics of the hidden state sequence, and (ii)\\ndecode the hidden state sequence. We describe finite Markov chain imbedding\\n(FMCI) and hybrid decoding to solve each of these two tasks. In the first part\\nof our paper we use FMCI to compute posterior distributions of summary\\nstatistics such as the number of visits to a hidden state, the total time spent\\nin a hidden state, the dwell time in a hidden state, and the longest run\\nlength. We use simulations from the hidden state sequence, conditional on the\\nobserved sequence, to establish the FMCI framework. In the second part of our\\npaper we apply hybrid segmentation for improved decoding of a HMM. We\\ndemonstrate that hybrid decoding shows increased performance compared to\\nViterbi or Posterior decoding (often also referred to as global or local\\ndecoding), and we introduce a novel procedure for choosing the tuning parameter\\nin the hybrid procedure. Furthermore, we provide an alternative derivation of\\nthe hybrid loss function based on weighted geometric means. We demonstrate and\\napply FMCI and hybrid decoding on various classical data sets, and supply\\naccompanying code for reproducibility.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ML\", \"categories\": \"stat.ML,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T14:58:35Z\"}"}
