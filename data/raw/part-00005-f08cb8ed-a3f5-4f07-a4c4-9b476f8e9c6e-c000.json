We solve the Schr\\\\\\\"odinger\\nequation for the system-bath model without the Born-Markov approximation to\\nderive the non-Markovian reduced dynamics of the qubit. We further construct an\\nexact Lindblad-type master equation for it. Similar to the quantum Otto cycle,\\nwe construct a non- Markovian quasi-cyclic process based on the atom-cavity\\ninteractions, which we call the quasi-Otto cycle. For judicious choices of\\ninput state and parameters, the quasi-cycle can be more efficient as a quantum\\nengine than the Otto cycle. We also showed that if the quasi-cycle is repeated\\nmultiple times, the efficiency of the quasi-Otto engine asymptotically\\napproaches that of the Otto engine.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T03:48:27Z\"}"}
