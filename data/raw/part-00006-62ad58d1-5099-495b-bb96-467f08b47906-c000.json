We propose a scheme inducing a non-trivial\\nAharonov-Anandan geometric phase in pairs of atoms interacting via\\ndipole-dipole potential. Our protocol relies on mobile optical trap technology\\nand consists of steering a single atom along a closed loop. The trajectory of\\nthe atom is controlled by a mobile optical trap, and the shape of the path is\\ndesigned by applying an optimal control procedure. The geometric phase is\\ngenerated as a residual of the two-atom entanglement induced by the\\ndipole-dipole interaction. The stability of our scheme in the presence of noise\\nor experimental imperfections is discussed.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:06:40Z\"}"}
