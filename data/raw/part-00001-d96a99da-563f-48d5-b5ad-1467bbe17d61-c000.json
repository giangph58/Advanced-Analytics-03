However, their limited timescale of a few microseconds is a significant\\nobstacle in describing phenomena such as conformational transitions of\\nbiomolecules and polymorphism in molecular crystals. Recently, stochastic\\nresetting, i.e., randomly stopping and restarting the simulations, emerged as a\\npowerful enhanced sampling approach, which is collective variable-free, highly\\nparallelized, and easily implemented in existing molecular dynamics codes.\\nResetting expedites sampling rare events while enabling the inference of\\nkinetic observables of the underlying process. It can be employed as a\\nstandalone tool or in combination with other enhanced sampling methods, such as\\nMetadynamics, with each technique compensating for the drawbacks of the other.\\nHere, we comprehensively describe resetting and its theoretical background,\\nreview recent developments in stochastic resetting for enhanced sampling, and\\nprovide instructive guidelines for practitioners.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:39:14Z\"}"}
