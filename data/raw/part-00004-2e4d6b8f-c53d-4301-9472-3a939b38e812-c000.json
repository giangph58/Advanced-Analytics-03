Our results show that the attraction between a nucleon and\\n$\\\\bar{\\\\Omega}$ is slightly stronger than that between a nucleon and $\\\\Omega$,\\nsuggesting that the $p \\\\bar{\\\\Omega}$ system is more likely to form bound\\nstates. The dynamic calculations indicate that the $p \\\\bar{\\\\Omega}$ systems\\nwith both $J^{P}=1^{-}$ and $2^{-}$ can form bound states, with binding\\nenergies deeper than those of the $p \\\\Omega$ systems with $J^{P}=2^{+}$. The\\nscattering phase shift and scattering parameter calculations also support the\\nexistence of $p \\\\bar{\\\\Omega}$ states. Additionally, we discuss the behavior of\\nthe femtoscopic correlation function for the $p \\\\bar{\\\\Omega}$ pairs for the\\nfirst time. Considering the significant progress in experimental measurements\\nof the correlation function of the $p \\\\Omega$ system, the further study of the\\n$p \\\\bar{\\\\Omega}$ systems using femtoscopic techniques will be a very valuable\\nwork.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex,hep-lat,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T07:22:38Z\"}"}
