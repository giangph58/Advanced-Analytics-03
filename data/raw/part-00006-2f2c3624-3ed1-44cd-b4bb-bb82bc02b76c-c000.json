We show that the uniqueness holds in\\nnon-homogeneous Besov spaces without any additional assumption which is\\nsupposed to constract solutions. When the power of the fractional Laplacian is\\nclose to 2, we prove that the uniqueness with the regularity index $s=-1/2$. We\\nextract the least regularity $s=-1/2$ for the well-definedness of the nonlinear\\nterm of the equation.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T02:12:20Z\"}"}
