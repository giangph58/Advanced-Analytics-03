In this article, we resolve the smooth, metric, and complex\\ncyclic Nielsen realization problem for certain \\\"irreducible\\\" mapping classes on\\nthe family of smooth 4-manifolds underlying del Pezzo surfaces. Both positive\\nand negative examples of realizability are provided in various settings. Our\\ntechniques are varied, synthesizing results from reflection group theory and\\n4-manifold topology.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GT\", \"categories\": \"math.GT,math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T04:11:04Z\"}"}
