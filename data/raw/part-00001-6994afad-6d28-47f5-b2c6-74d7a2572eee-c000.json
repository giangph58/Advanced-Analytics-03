Our approach is based on transforming the system into a partial\\ndifferential equation with random, time- and space-dependent coefficients. A\\nkey challenge arises from the fact that these coefficients are\\nnon-differentiable in time, rendering standard compactness arguments for the\\nidentification of the pressure inapplicable. To overcome this difficulty, we\\ndevelop a novel multi-layer approximation scheme and introduce a precise\\nlocalization strategy with respect to both the sample space and time variable.\\nThe limit pressure is then identified via the corresponding effective viscous\\nflux identity. By means of stochastic compactness methods, particularly\\nSkorokhod's representation theorem and its generalization by Jakubowski, we\\nensure the progressive measurability required to return to the original system.\\nOur results broaden the applicability of transport noise models in fluid\\ndynamics and offer new insights into the interaction between stochastic effects\\nand compressibility.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T14:17:25Z\"}"}
