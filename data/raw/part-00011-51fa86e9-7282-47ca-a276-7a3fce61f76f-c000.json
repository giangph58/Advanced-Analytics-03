Two sum-rate\\nmaximization problems are formulated under minimum mean square error (MMSE)\\ndecoding, with and without successive interference cancellation (SIC). To\\naddress the joint optimization of pinching antenna locations and user transmit\\npowers, a fractional programming-based approach is proposed. Numerical results\\nvalidate the effectiveness of the proposed method and show that PASS can\\nsignificantly enhance uplink sum-rate performance compared to conventional\\nfixed-antenna designs.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP,cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T09:59:45Z\"}"}
