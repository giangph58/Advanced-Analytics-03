{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01847v1\", \"title\": \"Confluence of Conditional Rewriting Modulo\", \"summary\": \"Sets of equations E play an important computational role in rewriting-based\\nsystems R by defining an equivalence relation =E inducing a partition of terms\\ninto E-equivalence classes on which rewriting computations, denoted ->R/E and\\ncalled *rewriting modulo E*, are issued. This paper investigates *confluence of\\n->R/E*, usually called *E-confluence*, for *conditional* rewriting-based\\nsystems, where rewriting steps are determined by conditional rules. We rely on\\nJouannaud and Kirchner's framework to investigate confluence of an abstract\\nrelation R modulo an abstract equivalence relation E on a set A. We show how to\\nparticularize the framework to be used with conditional systems. Then, we show\\nhow to define appropriate finite sets of *conditional pairs* to prove and\\ndisprove E-confluence. In particular, we introduce *Logic-based Conditional\\nCritical Pairs* which do not require the use of (often infinitely many)\\nE-unifiers to provide a finite representation of the *local peaks* considered\\nin the abstract framework. We also introduce *parametric Conditional Variable\\nPairs* which are essential to deal with conditional rules in the analysis of\\nE-confluence. Our results apply to well-known classes of rewriting-based\\nsystems. In particular, to *Equational (Conditional) Term Rewriting Systems*.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LO\", \"categories\": \"cs.LO,cs.PL,cs.SC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:55:06Z\"}"}
