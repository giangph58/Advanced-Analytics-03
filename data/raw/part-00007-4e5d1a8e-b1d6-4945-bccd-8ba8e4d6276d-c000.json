{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04914v1\", \"title\": \"Nonparametric modal regression with missing response observations\", \"summary\": \"Modal regression has emerged as a flexible alternative to classical\\nregression models when the conditional mean or median are unable to adequately\\ncapture the underlying relation between a response and a predictor variable.\\nThis approach is particularly useful when the conditional distribution of the\\nresponse given the covariate presents several modes, so the suitable regression\\nfunction is a multifunction. In recent years, some proposals have addressed\\nmodal (smooth) regression estimation using kernel methods. In addition, some\\nremarkable extensions to deal with censored, dependent or circular data have\\nbeen also introduced. However, the case of incomplete samples due to\\nmissingness has not been studied in the literature. This paper adapts the\\nnonparametric modal regression tools to handle missing observations in the\\nresponse, investigating several imputation approaches through an extensive\\nsimulation study. The performance in practice of our proposals are also\\nillustrated with two real--data examples.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T10:49:28Z\"}"}
