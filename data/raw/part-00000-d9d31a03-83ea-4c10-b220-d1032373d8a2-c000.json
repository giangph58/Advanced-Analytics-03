{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23746v1\", \"title\": \"Short-video Propagation Influence Rating: A New Real-world Dataset and A\\n  New Large Graph Model\", \"summary\": \"Short-video platforms have gained immense popularity, captivating the\\ninterest of millions, if not billions, of users globally. Recently, researchers\\nhave highlighted the significance of analyzing the propagation of short-videos,\\nwhich typically involves discovering commercial values, public opinions, user\\nbehaviors, etc. This paper proposes a new Short-video Propagation Influence\\nRating (SPIR) task and aims to promote SPIR from both the dataset and method\\nperspectives. First, we propose a new Cross-platform Short-Video (XS-Video)\\ndataset, which aims to provide a large-scale and real-world short-video\\npropagation network across various platforms to facilitate the research on\\nshort-video propagation. Our XS-Video dataset includes 117,720 videos, 381,926\\nsamples, and 535 topics across 5 biggest Chinese platforms, annotated with the\\npropagation influence from level 0 to 9. To the best of our knowledge, this is\\nthe first large-scale short-video dataset that contains cross-platform data or\\nprovides all of the views, likes, shares, collects, fans, comments, and comment\\ncontent. Second, we propose a Large Graph Model (LGM) named NetGPT, based on a\\nnovel three-stage training mechanism, to bridge heterogeneous graph-structured\\ndata with the powerful reasoning ability and knowledge of Large Language Models\\n(LLMs). Our NetGPT can comprehend and analyze the short-video propagation\\ngraph, enabling it to predict the long-term propagation influence of\\nshort-videos. Comprehensive experimental results evaluated by both\\nclassification and regression metrics on our XS-Video dataset indicate the\\nsuperiority of our method for SPIR.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.CL,cs.LG,cs.MM,cs.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T05:53:15Z\"}"}
