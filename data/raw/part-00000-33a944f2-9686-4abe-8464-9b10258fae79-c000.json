{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10451v1\", \"title\": \"Minimizing Functions of Age of Incorrect Information for Remote\\n  Estimation\", \"summary\": \"The age of incorrect information (AoII) process which keeps track of the time\\nsince the source and monitor processes are in sync, has been extensively used\\nin remote estimation problems. In this paper, we consider a push-based remote\\nestimation system with a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) information source\\ntransmitting status update packets towards the monitor once the AoII process\\nexceeds a certain estimation-based threshold. In this paper, the time average\\nof an arbitrary function of AoII is taken as the AoII cost, as opposed to using\\nthe average AoII as the mismatch metric, whereas this function is also allowed\\nto depend on the estimation value. In this very general setting, our goal is to\\nminimize a weighted sum of AoII and transmission costs. For this purpose, we\\nformulate a discrete-time semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) regarding the\\nmulti-threshold status update policy. We propose a novel tool in discrete-time\\ncalled 'dual-regime absorbing Markov chain' (DR-AMC) and its corresponding\\nabsorption time distribution named as 'dual-regime phase-type' (DR-PH)\\ndistribution, to obtain the characterizing parameters of the SMDP, which allows\\nus to obtain the distribution of the AoII process for a given policy, and hence\\nthe average of any function of AoII. The proposed method is validated with\\nnumerical results by which we compare our proposed method against other\\npolicies obtained by exhaustive-search, and also various benchmark policies.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:39:06Z\"}"}
