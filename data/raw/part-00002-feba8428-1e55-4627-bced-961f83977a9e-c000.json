In the case of an electrically insulating wall and an electric field\\napplied tangentially to the wall, the interaction of the drop with its\\nelectrostatic image gives rise to repulsion by the wall. However, the\\nelectrohydrodynamic flow causes either repulsion for a drop with\\n$\\\\mathrm{R/P}<1$, where $\\\\mathrm{R}$ and $\\\\mathrm{P}$ are the drop-to-medium\\nratios of conductivity and permittivity, respectively, or attraction for\\n$\\\\mathrm{R/P}>1$. We experimentally measure droplet trajectories and quantify\\nthe wall-induced electrohydrodynamic lift in the case $\\\\mathrm{R/P}<1$.\\nNumerical simulations using the boundary integral method agree well with the\\nexperiment and also explore the $\\\\mathrm{R/P}>1$ case. The results show that\\nthe lateral migration of a drop in a uniform electric field applied parallel to\\nan insulating wall is dominated by the long-range flow due to the image\\nstresslet.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T05:28:44Z\"}"}
