{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06082v1\", \"title\": \"New concept to measure the Poiseuille coefficient of rarefied gas flow\\n  driven by a large pressure drop\", \"summary\": \"The Poiseuille coefficient, which relates the mass flow rate through a long\\ncapillary to the local pressure gradient, is an important characteristic in\\ndesigning various technological processes that include vacuum systems as part.\\nThis quantity is usually calculated by solving numerically the linearized\\nBoltzmann equation assuming a small pressure gradient and, therefore, the mass\\nflow rate is small too. As a result, to extract accurately this coefficient\\nfrom experimental measurements, the mass flow rate must remain small. The\\npresent paper proposes a novel approach to extract the Poiseuille coefficient\\nfrom a measurement of mass flow rate driven by a large pressure drop. Under\\nthese conditions, the flow rate increases significantly and, hence, the\\nexperimental error is reduced. The proposed method will help experimentalists\\nin designing measurement devices to determine the Poiseuille coefficient with a\\nhigher accuracy.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:21:55Z\"}"}
