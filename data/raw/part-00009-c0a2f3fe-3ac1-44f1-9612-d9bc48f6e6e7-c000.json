{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10073v1\", \"title\": \"Quantum-Classical Comparison of B-cell Epitope Prediction Using QSVM and\\n  VQC\", \"summary\": \"Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a classical and widely applied supervised\\nmachine learning algorithm for binary classification. Utilizing the kernel\\ntrick enables embedding data into higher-dimensional feature spaces to address\\nnon-linear classification tasks effectively.\\n  This study investigates the classical SVM and its quantum counterpart, the\\nQuantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM), which leverages quantum feature maps to\\nembed data into high-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Additionally, we explore the\\nVariational Quantum Classifier (VQC), a fully quantum model based on\\nparameterized quantum circuits.\\n  We apply these quantum and classical models to the task of B-cell epitope\\nprediction, a critical problem in immunoinformatics relevant to vaccine design.\\nUsing curated data from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB), we examine\\nclassification performance under varying feature dimensionality and sample\\nsizes. Dimensionality reduction is performed using Principal Component Analysis\\n(PCA), and experiments include both QSVM and VQC under multiple training\\nconditions.\\n  Our findings show that VQC generally performs better on larger,\\nhigh-dimensional datasets, while QSVM maintains more stable accuracy on small,\\nnoise-free datasets. This study also highlights the resource trade-offs between\\nthe two models: QSVM demands extensive kernel evaluations, while VQC benefits\\nfrom shallow circuits and sample-wise training, making it suitable for\\nnear-term quantum hardware. These results contribute to understanding how\\ndifferent quantum machine learning models perform under practical constraints\\nin biomedical sequence classification.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T10:19:33Z\"}"}
