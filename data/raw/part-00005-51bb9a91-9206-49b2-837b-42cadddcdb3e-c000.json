Using this strategy, it is\\npossible to assess the validity of such models without specifying the\\ndistribution of the estimators of the angular power spectrum being used. This\\nholds under general conditions, ensuring the applicability of the method across\\ndiverse scenarios. Moreover, the proposed solution overcomes the need for\\ncase-by-case simulations when testing different models -- leading to notable\\ncomputational advantages.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.data-an\", \"categories\": \"physics.data-an,astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T17:57:37Z\"}"}
