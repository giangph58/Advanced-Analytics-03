In this paper, we attempt to investigate the relations between\\nconjugacy classes of the group $F$ and the links being constructed. For each\\nunoriented link $L$, we find a sequence of elements of $F$ from distinct\\nconjugacy classes which yield $L$ via Jones's construction. We also show that a\\nsequence of $2$-bridge links can be constructed from elements in the conjugacy\\nclass of $x_0$ (resp. $x_1$).\", \"main_category\": \"math.GT\", \"categories\": \"math.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T13:22:23Z\"}"}
