Conventional thermal comfort models, such\\nas the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV), rely on both environmental and personal\\nvariables. However, the use of fixed-location sensors limits the ability to\\ncapture spatial variability, which reduces the accuracy of occupant-specific\\ncomfort estimation. To address this limitation, this study proposes a new PMV\\nestimation method that incorporates spatial environmental data reconstructed\\nusing the Gappy Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (Gappy POD) algorithm. In\\naddition, a group PMV-based control framework is developed to account for the\\nthermal comfort of multiple occupants. The Gappy POD method enables fast and\\naccurate reconstruction of indoor temperature fields from sparse sensor\\nmeasurements. Using these reconstructed fields and occupant location data,\\nspatially resolved PMV values are calculated. Group-level thermal conditions\\nare then derived through statistical aggregation methods and used to control\\nindoor temperature in a multi-occupant living lab environment. Experimental\\nresults show that the Gappy POD algorithm achieves an average relative error\\nbelow 3\\\\% in temperature reconstruction. PMV distributions varied by up to 1.26\\nscale units depending on occupant location. Moreover, thermal satisfaction\\noutcomes varied depending on the group PMV method employed. These findings\\nunderscore the importance for adaptive thermal control strategies that\\nincorporate both spatial and individual variability, offering valuable insights\\nfor future occupant-centric building operations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CE\", \"categories\": \"cs.CE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T11:43:28Z\"}"}
