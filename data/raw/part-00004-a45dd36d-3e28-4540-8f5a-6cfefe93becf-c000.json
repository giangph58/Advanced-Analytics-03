{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01486v1\", \"title\": \"Generalized Assignment and Knapsack Problems in the Random-Order Model\", \"summary\": \"We study different online optimization problems in the random-order model.\\nThere is a finite set of bins with known capacity and a finite set of items\\narriving in a random order. Upon arrival of an item, its size and its value for\\neach of the bins is revealed and it has to be decided immediately and\\nirrevocably to which bin the item is assigned, or to not assign the item at\\nall. In this setting, an algorithm is $\\\\alpha$-competitive if the total value\\nof all items assigned to the bins is at least an $\\\\alpha$-fraction of the total\\nvalue of an optimal assignment that knows all items beforehand. We give an\\nalgorithm that is $\\\\alpha$-competitive with $\\\\alpha = (1-\\\\ln(2))/2 \\\\approx\\n1/6.52$ improving upon the previous best algorithm with $\\\\alpha \\\\approx 1/6.99$\\nfor the generalized assignment problem and the previous best algorithm with\\n$\\\\alpha \\\\approx 1/6.65$ for the integral knapsack problem. We then study the\\nfractional knapsack problem where we have a single bin and it is also allowed\\nto pack items fractionally. For that case, we obtain an algorithm that is\\n$\\\\alpha$-competitive with $\\\\alpha = 1/e \\\\approx 1/2.71$ improving on the\\nprevious best algorithm with $\\\\alpha = 1/4.39$. We further show that this\\ncompetitive ratio is the best-possible for deterministic algorithms in this\\nmodel.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:38:41Z\"}"}
