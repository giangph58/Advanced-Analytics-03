{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04474v1\", \"title\": \"Portal Matter Models of Kinetic Mixing with Two Light Dark Gauge Bosons\", \"summary\": \"The kinetic mixing (KM) portal mandates the existence of at least one new\\ngauge boson, the dark photon (DP) based on the group $U(1)_D$, which mixes with\\nthe Standard Model (SM) photon via loops of other new heavy particles carrying\\nboth SM and dark charges called portal matter (PM). Arguments exist based on\\nthe RGE running of the $U(1)_D$ gauge coupling suggesting that at higher scales\\n$U(1)_D$ becomes part of a more complex non-Abelian group, a simple example\\nbeing just the SM-like $G_D=SU(2)_I \\\\times U(1)_{Y_I}$. In our past analyses it\\nwas always assumed that $G_D$ broke in a SM-like manner directly to the DP's\\n$U(1)_D$ which then subsequently broke at low energies $\\\\lsim 1$ GeV. However,\\nthis need not be the case and $G_D$ can instead break to $U(1)_{T_{3I}}\\\\times\\nU(1)_{Y_I}$, with $T_{3I}$ being the diagonal generator of $SU(2)_I$, now\\nproducing two light gauge bosons which obtain masses at the $\\\\lsim 1$ GeV\\nscale. In this paper we will explore the phenomenology of a very simple\\nrealization of this kind of alternative setup employing non-abelian KM and\\nhaving a minimal, lepton-like PM sector, demonstrating its distinctive nature\\nin comparison to the previously examined symmetry breaking path. The effects of\\ninterference between these gauge bosons on thermal dark matter annihilation,\\nthe production of new heavy gauge, Higgs and PM states at colliders, as well as\\nthe corresponding signatures for the light dark gauge bosons are examined.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:43:15Z\"}"}
