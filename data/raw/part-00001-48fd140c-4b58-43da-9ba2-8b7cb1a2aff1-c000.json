This paper introduces a five-dimensional audit\\nmodel -- assessing Analytic Quality, Breadth of Ethical Considerations, Depth\\nof Explanation, Consistency, and Decisiveness -- to evaluate the ethical logic\\nof leading large language models (LLMs). Drawing on traditions from applied\\nethics and higher-order thinking, we present a multi-battery prompt approach,\\nincluding novel ethical dilemmas, to probe the models' reasoning across diverse\\ncontexts. We benchmark seven major LLMs finding that while models generally\\nconverge on ethical decisions, they vary in explanatory rigor and moral\\nprioritization. Chain-of-Thought prompting and reasoning-optimized models\\nsignificantly enhance performance on our audit metrics. This study introduces a\\nscalable methodology for ethical benchmarking of AI systems and highlights the\\npotential for AI to complement human moral reasoning in complex decision-making\\ncontexts.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T13:32:30Z\"}"}
