Thanks to the high acoustic velocity and low-loss diamond\\nsubstrate, the prototype resonator at 12.9 GHz achieves a high phase velocity\\n($v_p$) of 8671 m/s, a maximum Bode-$Q$ of 408, and coupling coefficient\\n($k_{\\\\mathrm{eff}}^2$) of 2.1%, outperforming high-velocity substrates such as\\nSiC and sapphire by more than 20% in velocity. Resonators spanning 8-18 GHz are\\npresented. The platform's high power handling above 12.5 dBm is also\\nexperimentally validated.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:08:55Z\"}"}
