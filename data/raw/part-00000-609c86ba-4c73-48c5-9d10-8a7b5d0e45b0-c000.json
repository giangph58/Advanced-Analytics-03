{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04211v1\", \"title\": \"Omnigenous umbilic stellarators\", \"summary\": \"To better understand the dependence of the magnetic field structure in the\\nplasma edge due to plasma boundary shape, we define and develop umbilic\\nstellarators. These equilibria are characterized by a single continuous\\nhigh-curvature edge on the plasma boundary that goes around multiple times\\ntoroidally before meeting itself. We develop a technique that allows us to\\nsimultaneously optimize the plasma boundary along with a curve lying on the\\nboundary on which we impose a high curvature while imposing omnigenity -- a\\nproperty of the magnetic field that ensures trapped particle confinement\\nthroughout the plasma volume. After generating omnigenous umbilic stellarators,\\nwe design coil sets for some of these equilibria and calculate and understand\\nthe field line structure in the edge. Finally, we propose an experiment to\\nmodify an existing tokamak to a stellarator using this technique and explore a\\npotential way to convert a limited tokamak into a diverted stellarator.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:05:50Z\"}"}
