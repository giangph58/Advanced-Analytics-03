However, limited onboard computational resources and data downlink\\nconstraints necessitate robust methods for identifying regions of interest in\\nreal time. This work presents an adaptive outlier detection algorithm based on\\nthe reconstruction error of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature\\nreduction, designed explicitly for space mission applications. The algorithm\\nadapts dynamically to evolving data distributions by using Incremental PCA,\\nenabling deployment without a predefined model for all possible conditions. A\\npre-scaling process normalizes each feature's magnitude while preserving\\nrelative variance within feature types. We demonstrate the algorithm's\\neffectiveness in detecting space plasma events, such as distinct space\\nenvironments, dayside and nightside transients phenomena, and transition layers\\nthrough NASA's MMS mission observations. Additionally, we apply the method to\\nNASA's THEMIS data, successfully identifying a dayside transient using\\nonboard-available measurements.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,physics.space-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T12:42:38Z\"}"}
