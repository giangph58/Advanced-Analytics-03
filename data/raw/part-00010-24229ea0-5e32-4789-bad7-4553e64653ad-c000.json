{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10922v1\", \"title\": \"Equivalence of germs (of mappings and sets) over k vs that over K\", \"summary\": \"Consider real-analytic mapping-germs, (R^n,o)-> (R^m,o). They can be\\nequivalent (by coordinate changes) complex-analytically, but not\\nreal-analytically. However, if the transformation of complex-equivalence is\\nidentity modulo higher order terms, then it implies the real-equivalence.\\n  On the other hand, starting from complex-analytic map-germs (C^n,o)->(C^m,o),\\nand taking any field extension, C to K, one has: if two maps are equivalent\\nover K, then they are equivalent over C.\\n  These (quite useful) properties seem to be not well known. We prove slightly\\nstronger properties in a more general form:\\n  * for Maps(X,Y) where X,Y are (formal/analytic/Nash) scheme-germs, with\\narbitrary singularities, over a base ring k;\\n  * for the classical groups of (right/left-right/contact) equivalence of\\nSingularity Theory;\\n  * for faithfully-flat extensions of rings k -> K. In particular, for\\narbitrary extension of fields, in any characteristic.\\n  The case ``k is a ring\\\" is important for the study of\\ndeformations/unfoldings. E.g. it implies the statement for fields: if a family\\nof maps {f_t} is trivial over K, then it is also trivial over k.\\n  Similar statements for scheme-germs (``isomorphism over K vs isomorphism over\\nk\\\") follow by the standard reduction ``Two maps are contact equivalent iff\\ntheir zero sets are ambient isomorphic\\\".\\n  This study involves the contact equivalence of maps with singular targets,\\nwhich seems to be not well-established. We write down the relevant part of this\\ntheory.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG,math.AC,math.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T07:09:27Z\"}"}
