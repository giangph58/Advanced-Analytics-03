{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17638v1\", \"title\": \"Testing Quintessence Axion Dark Energy with Recent Cosmological Results\", \"summary\": \"We investigate a quintessence axion model for dynamical dark energy,\\nmotivated in part by recent results from the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO)\\nmeasurements of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Cosmic\\nMicrowave Background (CMB) observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope\\n(ACT). By carefully treating the initial conditions and parameter sampling, we\\nidentify a preferred parameter space featuring a sub-Planckian axion decay\\nconstant and a relatively large axion mass, which naturally avoids the quality\\nproblem and remains consistent with the perturbative string conjecture. Our\\nparameter scan also uncovers a trans-Planckian regime of theoretical interest,\\nwhich is only mildly disfavored by observations. The results remain robust when\\nDESI BAO data are combined with CMB and supernova observations. Finally, we\\ndiscuss the possible connection between this model and the recently reported\\nnon-zero rotation of the CMB linear polarization angle, emphasizing the broader\\ncosmological implications and the promising prospects for testing this\\nscenario. We show that an $\\\\mathcal{O}(1)$ electromagnetic anomaly coefficient\\nis preferred by the strongest constraint, which is in full agreement with the\\nminimal quintessence axion model.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:09:38Z\"}"}
