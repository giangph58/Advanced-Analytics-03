We assume that both the observer and the light source are located at a\\nfinite distance from the lens object, and calculate the gravitational\\ndeflection angle of light ray by such a black hole based on Gauss-Bonnet\\ntheorem. Furthermore, we derive the angular radius of Einstein rings associated\\nwith black holes in dRGT massive gravity, thereby facilitating a comprehensive\\ndiscussion on the ramifications of the graviton mass. Notably, our findings\\nreveal pronounced impacts of the graviton mass on both light deflection angles\\nand Einstein ring characteristics, underscoring its significance in dRGT\\nmassive gravity and enhancing the detectability of black holes in gravitational\\nlensing observations, thereby opening new avenues for future research.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T10:08:51Z\"}"}
