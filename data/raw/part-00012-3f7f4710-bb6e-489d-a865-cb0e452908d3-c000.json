Building on a foundational result by Ryu, we fully characterize all\\nmethods that use only individual resolvent evaluations, direct evaluations of\\ncocoercive operators, and minimal memory resources while ensuring convergence\\nvia averaged fixed-point iterations. We show that all such methods are captured\\nby a unified framework, which includes known schemes and enables new ones with\\npromising features. Systematic numerical experiments lead us to propose three\\ndesign heuristics to achieve excellent performances in practice, yielding\\nsignificant gains over existing methods.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T09:15:58Z\"}"}
