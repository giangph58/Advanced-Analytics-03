The model describes a long-range mean-field system in\\nwhich N unit-mass particles move on a unit circle. Each particle theta_i\\ninteracts with any three other particles through an infinite-range cosine\\npotential with an attractive interaction (epsilon > 0). By applying a method\\nthat remaps the average phase of global particle pairs onto a new unit circle,\\nand using the saddle-point technique, the partition function is solved\\nanalytically after introducing four-body interactions, yielding expressions for\\nthe free energy f and the energy per particle U. These results were further\\nvalidated through numerical simulations. The results show that the system\\nundergoes a second-order phase transition at the critical energy U_c.\\nSpecifically, the critical energy corresponds to U_c = 0.32 when the coupling\\nconstant epsilon = 5, and U_c = 0.63 when epsilon = 10. Finally, we calculated\\nthe system's largest Lyapunov exponent lambda and kinetic energy fluctuations\\nSigma through numerical simulations. It is found that the peak of the largest\\nLyapunov exponent lambda occurs slightly below the critical energy U_c, which\\nis consistent with the point of maximum kinetic energy fluctuations Sigma. And\\nthere is a scaling law of Sigma / N^(1/2) proportional to lambda between them.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:53:33Z\"}"}
