While recent advances in 3D Gaussian\\nSplatting (3DGS) have enabled fast and high-quality scene reconstruction,\\nresearch has also explored incorporating open-vocabulary understanding into\\n3DGS. However, most existing methods require iterative optimization over\\nper-view 2D semantic feature maps, which not only results in inefficiencies but\\nalso leads to inconsistent 3D semantics across views. To address these\\nlimitations, we introduce a training-free framework that constructs a\\nsuperpoint graph directly from Gaussian primitives. The superpoint graph\\npartitions the scene into spatially compact and semantically coherent regions,\\nforming view-consistent 3D entities and providing a structured foundation for\\nopen-vocabulary understanding. Based on the graph structure, we design an\\nefficient reprojection strategy that lifts 2D semantic features onto the\\nsuperpoints, avoiding costly multi-view iterative training. The resulting\\nrepresentation ensures strong 3D semantic coherence and naturally supports\\nhierarchical understanding, enabling both coarse- and fine-grained\\nopen-vocabulary perception within a unified semantic field. Extensive\\nexperiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art\\nopen-vocabulary segmentation performance, with semantic field reconstruction\\ncompleted over $30\\\\times$ faster.
