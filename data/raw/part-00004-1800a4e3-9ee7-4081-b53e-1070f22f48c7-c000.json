A Cross-Sectional Study\\n  on the Prevalence of Community Smells\", \"summary\": \"Effective software development relies on managing both collaboration and\\ntechnology, but sociotechnical challenges can harm team dynamics and increase\\ntechnical debt. Although teams working on ML enabled systems are\\ninterdisciplinary, research has largely focused on technical issues, leaving\\ntheir socio-technical dynamics underexplored. This study aims to address this\\ngap by examining the prevalence, evolution, and interrelations of community\\nsmells, in open-source ML projects. We conducted an empirical study on 188\\nrepositories from the NICHE dataset using the CADOCS tool to identify and\\nanalyze community smells. Our analysis focused on their prevalence,\\ninterrelations, and temporal variations. We found that certain smells, such as\\nPrima Donna Effects and Sharing Villainy, are more prevalent and fluctuate over\\ntime compared to others like Radio Silence or Organizational Skirmish. These\\ninsights might provide valuable support for ML project managers in addressing\\nsocio-technical issues and improving team coordination.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T10:23:37Z\"}"}
