{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01508v1\", \"title\": \"UAKNN: Label Distribution Learning via Uncertainty-Aware KNN\", \"summary\": \"Label Distribution Learning (LDL) aims to characterize the polysemy of an\\ninstance by building a set of descriptive degrees corresponding to the\\ninstance. In recent years, researchers seek to model to obtain an accurate\\nlabel distribution by using low-rank, label relations, expert experiences, and\\nlabel uncertainty estimation. In general, these methods are based on algorithms\\nwith parameter learning in a linear (including kernel functions) or deep\\nlearning framework. However, these methods are difficult to deploy and update\\nonline due to high training costs, limited scalability, and outlier\\nsensitivity. To address this problem, we design a novel LDL method called\\nUAKNN, which has the advantages of the KNN algorithm with the benefits of\\nuncertainty modeling. In addition, we provide solutions to the dilemma of\\nexisting work on extremely label distribution spaces. Extensive experiments\\ndemonstrate that our method is significantly competitive on 12 benchmarks and\\nthat the inference speed of the model is well-suited for industrial-level\\napplications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:57:23Z\"}"}
