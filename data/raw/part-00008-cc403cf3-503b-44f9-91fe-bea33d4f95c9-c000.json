The accuracy of the data to within 5%\\nand its consistency across the energy range investigated, shows significant\\ndiscrepancies from previous works as to the major resonance features and\\nmagnitude of the TCS. Within the shape of the TCS, we have identified nine\\nfeatures which have been assigned to electron attachment resonances, most of\\nthem reported for the first time, while a comprehensive analysis of those\\npeaking at 7.0, 7.8, and 8.8 eV has led to solve the controversy about\\ndissociative electron attachment (DEA) cross-section that persisted for more\\nthan 50 years.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:10:39Z\"}"}
