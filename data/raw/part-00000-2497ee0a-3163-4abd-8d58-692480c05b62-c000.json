{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07490v1\", \"title\": \"Geological Inference from Textual Data using Word Embeddings\", \"summary\": \"This research explores the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP)\\ntechniques to locate geological resources, with a specific focus on industrial\\nminerals. By using word embeddings trained with the GloVe model, we extract\\nsemantic relationships between target keywords and a corpus of geological\\ntexts. The text is filtered to retain only words with geographical\\nsignificance, such as city names, which are then ranked by their cosine\\nsimilarity to the target keyword. Dimensional reduction techniques, including\\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA), Autoencoder, Variational Autoencoder (VAE),\\nand VAE with Long Short-Term Memory (VAE-LSTM), are applied to enhance feature\\nextraction and improve the accuracy of semantic relations.\\n  For benchmarking, we calculate the proximity between the ten cities most\\nsemantically related to the target keyword and identified mine locations using\\nthe haversine equation. The results demonstrate that combining NLP with\\ndimensional reduction techniques provides meaningful insights into the spatial\\ndistribution of natural resources. Although the result shows to be in the same\\nregion as the supposed location, the accuracy has room for improvement.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T06:46:38Z\"}"}
