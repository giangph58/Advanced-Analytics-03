{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03316v1\", \"title\": \"Shifted twisted Yangians and finite $W$-algebras of classical type\", \"summary\": \"We introduce parabolic presentations of twisted Yangians of types AI and AII,\\ninterpolating between the R-matrix presentation and the Drinfeld presentation.\\nThen we formulate and provide parabolic presentations for the shifted twisted\\nYangians. We define quotient algebras known as truncated shifted twisted\\nYangians and equip them with baby comultiplications, generalizing the work of\\nBrundan and Kleshchev. PBW bases for all (truncated) shifted twisted Yangians\\nof type AI and AII are established along the way. Applying the theory of\\nuniversal equivariant quantizations of conic symplectic singularities we show\\nthat the truncated twisted shifted Yangian is isomorphic to the finite\\n$W$-algebra which quantizes a suitable Slodowy slice. This provides a\\npresentation of the finite $W$-algebra associated with every even nilpotent\\nelement in type {\\\\sf B} and {\\\\sf C}, as well as every nilpotent element with\\ntwo Jordan blocks in type {\\\\sf D}. Finally we make a conjecture which would\\nsupply presentations in the remaining even cases in type {\\\\sf D}.\", \"main_category\": \"math.QA\", \"categories\": \"math.QA,math.RA,math.RT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:46:05Z\"}"}
