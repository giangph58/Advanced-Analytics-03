{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04278v1\", \"title\": \"Non-stationary Diffusion For Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting\", \"summary\": \"Due to the dynamics of underlying physics and external influences, the\\nuncertainty of time series often varies over time. However, existing Denoising\\nDiffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) often fail to capture this\\nnon-stationary nature, constrained by their constant variance assumption from\\nthe additive noise model (ANM). In this paper, we innovatively utilize the\\nLocation-Scale Noise Model (LSNM) to relax the fixed uncertainty assumption of\\nANM. A diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting framework, termed\\nNon-stationary Diffusion (NsDiff), is designed based on LSNM that is capable of\\nmodeling the changing pattern of uncertainty. Specifically, NsDiff combines a\\ndenoising diffusion-based conditional generative model with a pre-trained\\nconditional mean and variance estimator, enabling adaptive endpoint\\ndistribution modeling. Furthermore, we propose an uncertainty-aware noise\\nschedule, which dynamically adjusts the noise levels to accurately reflect the\\ndata uncertainty at each step and integrates the time-varying variances into\\nthe diffusion process. Extensive experiments conducted on nine real-world and\\nsynthetic datasets demonstrate the superior performance of NsDiff compared to\\nexisting approaches.
