We consider both expansions on countable Borel\\nequivalence relations and on countable groups, in the Borel, measure and\\ncategory settings, and establish some basic correspondences between the two\\nnotions. We also prove some general structure theorems for measure and\\ncategory. We then explore in detail many examples, including finding spanning\\ntrees in graphs, finding monochromatic sets in Ramsey's Theorem, and\\nlinearizing partial orders.\", \"main_category\": \"math.LO\", \"categories\": \"math.LO,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T05:01:02Z\"}"}
