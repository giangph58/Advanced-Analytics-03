Here, we introduce and investigate a scenario for the simultaneous\\nelectrical switching of electronic spin and magnonic chirality splitting in\\ntwo-dimensional FEAMs. Based on the C2DB database, employing symmetry analysis\\nand first-principles calculations, we study prototypical candidates CrPS$_3$\\nand V$_2$I$_2$O$_2$BrCl. We identify the mechanism: ferroelectricity arises\\nfrom asymmetric displacements (P along $z$ in CrPS$_3$, V along the\\n$xy$-direction in V$_2$I$_2$O$_2$BrCl), which inherently couples electric\\npolarization to both electronic and magnonic degrees of freedom by retaining\\n[C$_2$$||$M] symmetry. Our calculations explicitly demonstrate that reversing\\nthe ferroelectric polarization concurrently switches the sign of the electronic\\nspin splitting and chirality of magnonic modes. This shows these materials as\\ndual-switchable FEAMs, enabling unified electrical manipulation of electron and\\nmagnon properties. A potentially experimentally detectable method via the\\nmagneto-optical Kerr effect was derived. This work provides a\\nmaterials-specific realization and theoretical basis for designing novel\\nelectrically controlled multifunctional spintronic, spin caloritronic, and\\nmagnonic devices.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T08:46:19Z\"}"}
