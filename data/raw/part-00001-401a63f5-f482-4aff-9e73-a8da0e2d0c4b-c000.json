In\\nrescue applications, several studies have investigated the design of operator\\ninterfaces based on observations during major robotics competitions or field\\ndeployments. Based on this research, guidelines for good interface design were\\nempirically identified. The investigations on the UIs of teams participating in\\ncompetitions are often based on external observations during UI application,\\nwhich may miss some relevant requirements for UI flexibility. In this work, we\\npresent an open-source and flexibly configurable user interface based on\\nestablished guidelines and its exemplary use for wheeled, tracked, and walking\\nrobots. We explain the design decisions and cover the insights we have gained\\nduring its highly successful applications in multiple robotics competitions and\\nevaluations. The presented UI can also be adapted for other robots with little\\neffort and is available as open source.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T12:28:39Z\"}"}
