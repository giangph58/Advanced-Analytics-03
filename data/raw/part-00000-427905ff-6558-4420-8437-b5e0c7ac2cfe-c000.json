{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04533v1\", \"title\": \"Tipping in an adaptive climate network model\", \"summary\": \"With rising global temperatures Earth's tipping elements are becoming\\nincreasingly more vulnerable to crossing their critical thresholds. The\\nreaching of such tipping points does not only impact other tipping elements\\nthrough their connections, but can also have further effect on the global mean\\nsurface temperature (GMT) itself, either increasing or decreasing the\\nprobability of further tipping points being reached. Recently, a numerical\\nstudy analyzing the risk of tipping cascades has been conducted, using a\\nconceptual model describing the dynamics of a tipping element with its\\ninteractions with other tipping elements taken into account [1]. Here, we\\nextend the model substantially by including adaptation, so that the\\nGMT-feedback induced by the crossing of a tipping point is incorporated as\\nwell. We find that although the adaptive mechanism does not impact the risk for\\nthe occurrence of tipping events, large tipping cascades are less probable due\\nto the negative GMT-feedback of the ocean circulation systems. Furthermore,\\nseveral tipping elements can play a different role in cascades in the adaptive\\nmodel. In particular, the Amazon rainforest could be a trigger in a tipping\\ncascade. Overall, the adaptation mechanism tends to slightly stabilize the\\nnetwork.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.AO\", \"categories\": \"nlin.AO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T16:07:33Z\"}"}
