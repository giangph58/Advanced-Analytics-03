While the results may be familiar to experts in complex\\nanalysis and Riemann surface theory, we contend that this work offers a clear\\nand insightful perspective on the conformal properties of these geometrically\\ndistinct appearing tori.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T17:35:14Z\"}"}
