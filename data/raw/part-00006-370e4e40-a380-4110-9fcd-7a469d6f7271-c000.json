The system we consider is in non-standard\\nform. We completely characterize its dynamics, providing explicit threshold\\nquantities to distinguish between a rich variety of possible asymptotic\\nbehaviors. Moreover, we propose numerical results to illustrate our findings.\\nLastly, we comment on the real-world interpretation of these results, in an\\neconomic framework and in the context of predator-prey models.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS,q-bio.PE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:04:03Z\"}"}
