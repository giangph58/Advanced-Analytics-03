{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16412v1\", \"title\": \"Superconductivity and Electron Correlations in Kagome Metal LuOs3B2\", \"summary\": \"We report a comprehensive investigation of the physical properties of\\nLuOs3B2, characterized by an ideal Os-based kagome lattice. Resistivity and\\nmagnetization measurements confirm the emergence of type-II bulk\\nsuperconductivity with a critical temperature Tc=4.63 K. The specific heat jump\\nand the calculated electron-phonon coupling parameter support a moderately\\ncoupled superconducting state. Electron correlation effects are supported by\\nthe enhanced Wilson ratios. First-principles calculations reveal hallmark\\nfeatures of kagome band structure, including Dirac points, van Hove\\nsingularities, and quasi-flat bands, primarily derived from the Os d orbitals.\\nThe inclusion of spin-orbit coupling opens a gap at the Dirac points,\\nsignificantly altering the electronic properties. Furthermore, the\\nsuperconductivity and electronic properties of isomorphic compounds are\\ndiscussed. This work provides a thorough exploration of the superconducting and\\nnormal states of LuOs3B2, deepening the understanding of kagome\\nsuperconductors.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T04:28:50Z\"}"}
