The approach iteratively refines the\\nparameter estimates using set membership estimation. Performance enhancement\\nover iterations is achieved by learning the terminal cost from data. Safety is\\nenforced using a terminal set, which is also learned iteratively. The proposed\\nmethod guarantees recursive feasibility, constraint satisfaction, and a robust\\nbound on the closed-loop cost. Numerical simulations on a mass-spring-damper\\nsystem demonstrate improved computational efficiency and control performance\\ncompared to an existing robust adaptive MPC approach.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:00:34Z\"}"}
