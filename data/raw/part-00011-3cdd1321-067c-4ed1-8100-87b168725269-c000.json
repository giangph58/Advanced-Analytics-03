{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03407v1\", \"title\": \"CB-cPIR: Code-Based Computational Private Information Retrieval\", \"summary\": \"A private information retrieval (PIR) scheme is a protocol that allows a user\\nto retrieve a file from a database without revealing the identity of the\\ndesired file to a curious database. Given a distributed data storage system,\\nefficient PIR can be achieved by making assumptions about the colluding\\ncapabilities of the storage servers holding the database. If these assumptions\\nturn out to be incorrect, privacy is lost. In this work, we focus on the\\nworst-case assumption: full collusion or, equivalently, viewing the storage\\nsystem virtually as a single honest-but-curious server. We present CB-cPIR, a\\nsingle-server code-based computational private information retrieval (cPIR)\\nscheme that derives security from code-based cryptography. Specifically, the\\nqueries are protected by the hardness of decoding a random linear code. The\\nscheme is heavily inspired by the pioneering code-based cPIR scheme proposed by\\nHolzbaur, Hollanti, and Wachter-Zeh in [Holzbaur et al., \\\"Computational\\nCode-Based Single-Server Private Information Retrieval\\\", 2020 IEEE ISIT] and\\nfixes the vulnerabilities of the original scheme arising from highly probable\\nrank differences in submatrices of the user's query. For further validation, we\\ndraw comparisons to the state-of-the-art lattice-based cPIR schemes.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR,cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T10:34:44Z\"}"}
