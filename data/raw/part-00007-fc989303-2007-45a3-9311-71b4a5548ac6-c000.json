In this\\nwork, we investigate the transport properties of quark matter under finite\\nrotation, focusing specifically on electrical conductivity and shear viscosity\\nby using a two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. The chiral condensate in\\nthe NJL model decreases under rotation, leading to enhanced transport\\nproperties. Moreover, rotation induces anisotropy in the transport\\ncoefficients, which are calculated within the kinetic theory framework using\\nthe Boltzmann transport equation. The Coriolis force is introduced in the force\\nterm of the Boltzmann transport equation, like the Lorentz force, which is\\nconsidered for finite magnetic fields. By using a phenomenological\\ntemperature-dependent angular velocity, we observe that the variation of\\nanisotropic components with temperature preserves the traditional valley-shaped\\npattern. However, the magnitude of the anisotropic components is suppressed\\ncompared to the usual component one finds in the absence of rotation.\\nInterestingly, at zero net quark density, Hall-like transport phenomena emerge\\nas significant non-dissipative contributions under rotation, which is not\\nexpected under finite magnetic fields due to the cancellation of quark and\\nanti-quark Hall currents.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T14:48:51Z\"}"}
