{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17688v1\", \"title\": \"The Hubble Image Similarity Project\", \"summary\": \"We have created a large database of similarity information between\\nsub-regions of Hubble Space Telescope images. These data can be used to assess\\nthe accuracy of image search algorithms based on computer vision methods. The\\nimages were compared by humans in a citizen science project, where they were\\nasked to select similar images from a comparison sample. We utilized the Amazon\\nMechanical Turk system to pay our reviewers a fair wage for their work. Nearly\\n850,000 comparison measurements have been analyzed to construct a similarity\\ndistance matrix between all the pairs of images. We describe the algorithm used\\nto extract a robust distance matrix from the (sometimes noisy) user reviews.\\nThe results are very impressive: the data capture similarity between images\\nbased on morphology, texture, and other details that are sometimes difficult\\neven to describe in words (e.g., dusty absorption bands with sharp edges). The\\ncollective visual wisdom of our citizen scientists matches the accuracy of the\\ntrained eye, with even subtle differences among images faithfully reflected in\\nthe distances.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:58:00Z\"}"}
