{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12734v1\", \"title\": \"Pandora: A Code-Driven Large Language Model Agent for Unified Reasoning\\n  Across Diverse Structured Knowledge\", \"summary\": \"Unified Structured Knowledge Reasoning (USKR) aims to answer natural language\\nquestions (NLQs) by using structured sources such as tables, databases, and\\nknowledge graphs in a unified way. Existing USKR methods either rely on\\nemploying task-specific strategies or custom-defined representations, which\\nstruggle to leverage the knowledge transfer between different SKR tasks or\\nalign with the prior of LLMs, thereby limiting their performance. This paper\\nproposes a novel USKR framework named \\\\textsc{Pandora}, which takes advantage\\nof \\\\textsc{Python}'s \\\\textsc{Pandas} API to construct a unified knowledge\\nrepresentation for alignment with LLM pre-training. It employs an LLM to\\ngenerate textual reasoning steps and executable Python code for each question.\\nDemonstrations are drawn from a memory of training examples that cover various\\nSKR tasks, facilitating knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on four\\nbenchmarks involving three SKR tasks demonstrate that \\\\textsc{Pandora}\\noutperforms existing unified frameworks and competes effectively with\\ntask-specific methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T08:18:09Z\"}"}
