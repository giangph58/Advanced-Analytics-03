We explicitly\\nconstruct a generating set for the corresponding modular matrix invariant ring,\\ndemonstrating that this ring is a hypersurface. Using a recent result on\\n$a$-invariants of Cohen-Macaulay algebras, we determine the Hilbert series of\\nthis invariant ring, and our method avoids seeking the generating relation.\\nAdditionally, we prove that the modular matrix invariant ring of the group of\\nupper triangular $2 \\\\times 2$-matrices is also a hypersurface.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AC\", \"categories\": \"math.AC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T15:34:50Z\"}"}
