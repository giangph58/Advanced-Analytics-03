{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00326v1\", \"title\": \"Optimal Vector Compressed Sensing Using James Stein Shrinkage\", \"summary\": \"The trend in modern science and technology is to take vector measurements\\nrather than scalars, ruthlessly scaling to ever higher dimensional vectors. For\\nabout two decades now, traditional scalar Compressed Sensing has been\\nsynonymous with a Convex Optimization based procedure called Basis Pursuit. In\\nthe vector recovery case, the natural tendency is to return to a\\nstraightforward vector extension of Basis Pursuit, also based on Convex\\nOptimization. However, Convex Optimization is provably suboptimal, particularly\\nwhen $B$ is large. In this paper, we propose SteinSense, a lightweight\\niterative algorithm, which is provably optimal when $B$ is large. It does not\\nhave any tuning parameter, does not need any training data, requires zero\\nknowledge of sparsity, is embarrassingly simple to implement, and all of this\\nmakes it easily scalable to high vector dimensions. We conduct a massive volume\\nof both real and synthetic experiments that confirm the efficacy of SteinSense,\\nand also provide theoretical justification based on ideas from Approximate\\nMessage Passing. Fascinatingly, we discover that SteinSense is quite robust,\\ndelivering the same quality of performance on real data, and even under\\nsubstantial departures from conditions under which existing theory holds.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,eess.IV,eess.SP,stat.CO,stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T05:55:01Z\"}"}
