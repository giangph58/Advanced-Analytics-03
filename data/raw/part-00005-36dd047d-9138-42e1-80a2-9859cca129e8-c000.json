This variability is explained by radiative transfer\\nand magnetic properties of the molecule. To investigate this phenomenon, a 3D\\nmaser simulation is employed to study the SiO masers based on Zeeman splitting.\\nWe demonstrate that the magnetic field direction affects maser polarization\\nwithin small tubular domains with isotropic pumping, and yields results that\\nare similar to those obtained from 1D modelling. This work also studies larger\\nclouds with different shapes. We use finite-element domains with internal node\\ndistributions to represent the maser-supporting clouds. We calculate solutions\\nfor the population inversions in all transitions and at every node. These\\nsolutions show that saturation begins near the middle of a domain, moving\\ntowards the edges and particularly the ends of long axes, as saturation\\nprogresses, influencing polarization. When the observer's view of the domain\\nchanges, the plane of linear polarization responds to the projected shape and\\nthe projected magnetic field axis. The angle between the observer's line of\\nsight and the magnetic field may cause jumps in the plane of polarization.\\nTherefore, we can conclude that polarization is influenced by both the cloud's\\nmajor axis orientation and magnetic field direction. We have investigated the\\npossibility of explaining observed polarization plane rotations, apparently\\nwithin a single cloud, by the mechanism of line-of-sight overlap of two\\nmagnetized maser clouds.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T10:07:50Z\"}"}
