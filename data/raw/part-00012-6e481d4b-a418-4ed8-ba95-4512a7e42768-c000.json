{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11113v1\", \"title\": \"Generation of Relativistic Structured Spin-Polarized Lepton Beams\", \"summary\": \"Relativistic structured spin-polarized (SSP) particle beams, characterized by\\npolarization structures, are of critical importance in a wide range of\\napplications, such as material properties investigation, imaging, and\\ninformation storage. However, generation of relativistic SSP beams faces\\nsignificant challenges. Here, we put forward a novel method for generating\\nrelativistic SSP lepton beams via employing a moderate-intensity terahertz\\n(THz) wave. Building upon our foundational work on velocity-matched spin\\nrotation in dielectric-lined waveguides [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 075001 (2025)],\\nwe present the first demonstration of spin-polarization mode matching - a novel\\nmechanism that establishes a direct relation between waveguide modes and beam\\npolarization states. This breakthrough enables precise spatial control over\\nspin structures at relativistic energies, generating customizable\\nspin-polarization configurations such as spider-like, azimuthal, and helical\\nstructures, etc. Such SSP beams have the potential to generate high-energy\\nstructured photon beams and open a new avenue for research on relativistic\\nstructured particle beams, especially in nuclear physics, high-energy physics,\\nmaterials science and atomic physics.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T12:01:45Z\"}"}
