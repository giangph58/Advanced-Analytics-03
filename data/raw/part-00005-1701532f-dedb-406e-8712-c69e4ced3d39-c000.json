{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11329v1\", \"title\": \"Hunting for Maxwell's Demon in the Wild\", \"summary\": \"The apparent paradox of Maxwell's demon motivated the development of\\ninformation thermodynamics and, more recently, engineering advances enabling\\nthe creation of nanoscale information engines. From these advances, it is now\\nunderstood that nanoscale machines like the molecular motors within cells can\\nin principle operate as Maxwell demons. This motivates the question: does\\ninformation help power molecular motors? Answering this would seemingly require\\nsimultaneous measurement of all system degrees of freedom, which is generally\\nintractable in single-molecule experiments. To overcome this limitation, we\\nderive a statistical estimator to infer both the direction and magnitude of\\nsubsystem heat flows, and thus to determine whether -- and how strongly -- a\\nmotor operates as a Maxwell demon. The estimator uses only trajectory\\nmeasurements for a single degree of freedom. We demonstrate the estimator by\\napplying it to simulations of an experimental realization of an information\\nengine and a kinesin molecular motor. Our results show that kinesin transitions\\nto a Maxwell-demon mechanism in the presence of nonequilibrium noise, with a\\ncorresponding increase in velocity consistent with experiments. These findings\\nsuggest that molecular motors may have evolved to leverage active fluctuations\\nwithin cells.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech,physics.bio-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:03:10Z\"}"}
