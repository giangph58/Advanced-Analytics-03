{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17545v1\", \"title\": \"When Gaussian Meets Surfel: Ultra-fast High-fidelity Radiance Field\\n  Rendering\", \"summary\": \"We introduce Gaussian-enhanced Surfels (GESs), a bi-scale representation for\\nradiance field rendering, wherein a set of 2D opaque surfels with\\nview-dependent colors represent the coarse-scale geometry and appearance of\\nscenes, and a few 3D Gaussians surrounding the surfels supplement fine-scale\\nappearance details. The rendering with GESs consists of two passes -- surfels\\nare first rasterized through a standard graphics pipeline to produce depth and\\ncolor maps, and then Gaussians are splatted with depth testing and color\\naccumulation on each pixel order independently. The optimization of GESs from\\nmulti-view images is performed through an elaborate coarse-to-fine procedure,\\nfaithfully capturing rich scene appearance. The entirely sorting-free rendering\\nof GESs not only achieves very fast rates, but also produces view-consistent\\nimages, successfully avoiding popping artifacts under view changes. The basic\\nGES representation can be easily extended to achieve anti-aliasing in rendering\\n(Mip-GES), boosted rendering speeds (Speedy-GES) and compact storage\\n(Compact-GES), and reconstruct better scene geometries by replacing 3D\\nGaussians with 2D Gaussians (2D-GES). Experimental results show that GESs\\nadvance the state-of-the-arts as a compelling representation for ultra-fast\\nhigh-fidelity radiance field rendering.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T13:32:58Z\"}"}
