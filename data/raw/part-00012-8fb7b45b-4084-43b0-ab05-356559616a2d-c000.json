{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11366v1\", \"title\": \"A Decade of Wheat Mapping for Lebanon\", \"summary\": \"Wheat accounts for approximately 20% of the world's caloric intake, making it\\na vital component of global food security. Given this importance, mapping wheat\\nfields plays a crucial role in enabling various stakeholders, including policy\\nmakers, researchers, and agricultural organizations, to make informed decisions\\nregarding food security, supply chain management, and resource allocation. In\\nthis paper, we tackle the problem of accurately mapping wheat fields out of\\nsatellite images by introducing an improved pipeline for winter wheat\\nsegmentation, as well as presenting a case study on a decade-long analysis of\\nwheat mapping in Lebanon. We integrate a Temporal Spatial Vision Transformer\\n(TSViT) with Parameter-Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT) and a novel post-processing\\npipeline based on the Fields of The World (FTW) framework. Our proposed\\npipeline addresses key challenges encountered in existing approaches, such as\\nthe clustering of small agricultural parcels in a single large field. By\\nmerging wheat segmentation with precise field boundary extraction, our method\\nproduces geometrically coherent and semantically rich maps that enable us to\\nperform in-depth analysis such as tracking crop rotation pattern over years.\\nExtensive evaluations demonstrate improved boundary delineation and field-level\\nprecision, establishing the potential of the proposed framework in operational\\nagricultural monitoring and historical trend analysis. By allowing for accurate\\nmapping of wheat fields, this work lays the foundation for a range of critical\\nstudies and future advances, including crop monitoring and yield estimation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:31:54Z\"}"}
