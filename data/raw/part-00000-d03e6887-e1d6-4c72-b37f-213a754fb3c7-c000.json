{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19813v1\", \"title\": \"OmicsQ: A User-Friendly Platform for Interactive Quantitative Omics Data\\n  Analysis\", \"summary\": \"Motivation: High-throughput omics technologies generate complex datasets with\\nthousands of features that are quantified across multiple experimental\\nconditions, but often suffer from incomplete measurements, missing values and\\nindividually fluctuating variances. This requires sophisticated analytical\\nmethods for accurate, deep and insightful biological interpretations, capable\\nof dealing with a large variety of data properties and different amounts of\\ncompleteness. Software to handle such data complexity is rare and mostly relies\\non programming-based environments, limiting accessibility for researchers\\nwithout computational expertise. Results: We present OmicsQ, an interactive,\\nweb-based platform designed to streamline quantitative omics data analysis.\\nOmicsQ integrates established statistical processing tools with an intuitive,\\nbrowser-based visualization interface. It provides robust batch correction,\\nautomated experimental design annotation, and missing-data handling without\\nimputation, which ensures data integrity and avoids artifacts from a priori\\nassumptions. OmicsQ seamlessly interacts with external applications for\\nstatistical testing, clustering, analysis of protein complex behavior, and\\npathway enrichment, offering a comprehensive and flexible workflow from data\\nimport to biological interpretation that is broadly applicable tov data from\\ndifferent domains. Availability and Implementation: OmicsQ is implemented in R\\nand R Shiny and is available at\\nhttps://computproteomics.bmb.sdu.dk/app_direct/OmicsQ.
