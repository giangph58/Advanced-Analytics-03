Localized initial\\nconditions disperse if the strength of the nonlinear part drops below a\\nthreshold. Localized states are unstable in a noisy environment. As expected,\\nan infinite temperature state emerges when multiplicative noise is applied,\\nwhile additive noise yields unbounded dynamics since conservation of\\nnormalization is violated.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.PS\", \"categories\": \"nlin.PS,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T14:44:40Z\"}"}
