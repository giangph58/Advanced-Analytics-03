This paper proposes an\\nintegrated planner for automated vehicles (AVs) on ramps, utilizing an\\nunsatisfactory level metric for efficiency and arrow-cluster-based sampling for\\nsafety. The planner identifies optimal times for the AV to change lanes, taking\\ninto account the vehicle's velocity as a key factor in efficiency.\\nAdditionally, the integrated planner employs arrow-cluster-based sampling to\\nevaluate collision risks and select an optimal lane-changing curve. Extensive\\nsimulations were conducted in a ramp scenario to verify the planner's efficient\\nand safe performance. The results demonstrate that the proposed planner can\\neffectively select an appropriate lane-changing time point and a safe\\nlane-changing curve for AVs, without incurring any collisions during the\\nmaneuver.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.RO,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T06:09:54Z\"}"}
