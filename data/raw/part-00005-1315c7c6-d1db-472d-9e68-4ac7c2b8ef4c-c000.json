{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07919v1\", \"title\": \"Double White Dwarf Tides with Multi-messenger Measurements\", \"summary\": \"Short-period Galactic double white dwarf (DWD) systems will be observable\\nboth in visible light through photometric monitoring and in mHz-range\\ngravitational waves (GWs) with forthcoming space-based laser interferometry\\nsuch as LISA. When only photometric variability is used to measure DWD\\nintrinsic properties, there is a degeneracy between the chirp mass and binary\\ntidal interaction, as orbital frequency time derivative is set by both GW\\nradiation and tides. Without expensive radial velocity data from spectroscopic\\nmonitoring, this degeneracy may be lifted in principle by directly measuring\\nthe second time derivative of the orbital frequency through photometric\\nmonitoring over an ultra-long time baseline. Alternatively, the degeneracy can\\nbe removed by exploiting information in both photometric variability and the\\ncoherent GW waveform. Investigating both approaches, we find that direct\\nmeasurement of the second time derivative is likely infeasible for most DWDs,\\nwhile the multi-messenger method will disentangle measurements of the chirp\\nmass and the binary moments of inertia, for a large sample of tidally locked\\nsystems. The latter information will enable empirical tests of WD structure\\nmodels with finite temperature effects.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:33:52Z\"}"}
