Based on our previous work, we\\ndevelop non-perturbative methods to compute spectral sums and systematically\\nderive large-$n$ WKB expansion of the spectrum. Furthermore, we examine the\\nbehavior of these results in various asymptotic regimes, including the chiral,\\nheavy quark, and heavy-light limits, and establish a precise coincidence with\\nknown analytical and numerical results obtained through alternative approaches.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,hep-ph,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T13:42:10Z\"}"}
