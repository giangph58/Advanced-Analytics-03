We demonstrate that pre-shared entanglement using\\ntwo-mode squeezed vacuum states significantly reduces detection latency\\ncompared to classical and entanglement-augmented coherent-state probes. The\\nchange detection latency is inversely proportional to the quantum relative\\nentropy (QRE), which goes to infinity in the absence of thermal noise,\\nsuggesting idealized instantaneous detection. However, in realistic scenarios,\\nwe show that QRE scales logarithmically with the inverse of the thermal noise\\nmean photon number. We propose a receiver that achieves this scaling and\\nquantify its performance gains over existing methods. Additionally, we explore\\nthe fundamental trade-off between communication capacity and change detection\\nlatency, highlighting how pre-shared entanglement enhances both.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T04:17:55Z\"}"}
