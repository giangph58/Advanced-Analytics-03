{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00435v1\", \"title\": \"Modeling Metric Gyrosynchrotron Radio Emission From the Quiet Solar\\n  Corona\", \"summary\": \"The radio emission of the quiet Sun in the metric and decametric bands has\\nnot been well studied historically due to limitations of existing instruments.\\nIt is nominally dominated by thermal brehmsstrahlung of the solar corona, but\\nmay also include significant gyrosynchrotron emission, usually assumed to be\\nweak under quiet conditions. In this work, we investigate the expected\\ngyrosynchrotron contribution to solar radio emission in the lowest radio\\nfrequencies observable by ground instruments, for different regions of the low\\nand middle corona. We approximate the coronal conditions by a synoptic\\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model. The thermal emission is estimated from a\\nforward model based on the simulated corona. We calculate the expected\\ngyrosynchrotron emission with the Fast Gyrosynchrotron Codes framework by\\nFleishman & Kuznetsov (2010). The model emissions of different coronal regions\\nare compared with quiet-time observations between 20-90 MHz by the LOw\\nFrequency ARray (LOFAR) radio telescope. The contribution of gyrosynchrotron\\nradiation to low frequency solar radio emission may shed light on effects such\\nas the hitherto unexplained brightness variation observed in decametric coronal\\nhole emission, and help constrain measurements of the coronal magnetic fields.\\nIt can also improve our understanding of electron populations in the middle\\ncorona and their relation to the formation of the solar wind.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T10:17:31Z\"}"}
