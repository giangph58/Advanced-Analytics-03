{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04176v1\", \"title\": \"Developing Assessment Methods for Evaluating Learning Experience\", \"summary\": \"This research aims to investigate the gender-based learning experiences of\\nengineering students enrolled in the Probability and Statistics course,\\nfocusing on the four different assessment methods employed namely direct\\nconceptual learning (DCL), symposium, applied deployment and collaborative\\nlearning. The study encompasses 299 engineering students, comprising 90 females\\nand 209 males. Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA), is used to gain\\ndeeper insights into the complex interplay between assessment methods and their\\ninfluence on student learning. The results of the statistical analysis reveal\\nthat there are significant differences in the learning outcomes between female\\nand male engineering students in the assessment methods of direct conceptual\\nlearning, symposium, and applied deployment. The findings suggest that there is\\nno significant difference in the learning outcomes between female and male\\nengineering students in the collaborative learning assessment method. The\\ngraphical representation visually confirms the significant differences in\\ndirect conceptual learning, symposium, and applied deployment, while\\nillustrating no significant difference in collaborative learning between female\\nand male engineering students.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.OT\", \"categories\": \"stat.OT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T07:08:10Z\"}"}
