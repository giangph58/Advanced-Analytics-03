We first derive the\\nlocal projection error of the prediction step of the continuous-discrete\\nprojection filter. We then derive the exact Bayesian update algorithm for a\\nclass of discrete measurement processes with additive Gaussian noise. Lastly,\\nwe present a numerical simulation of the stochastic van der Pol filtering\\nproblem with a nonlinear measurement process. The proposed projection filter\\nshows superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art parametric\\ncontinuous-discrete filtering methods.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T07:30:05Z\"}"}
