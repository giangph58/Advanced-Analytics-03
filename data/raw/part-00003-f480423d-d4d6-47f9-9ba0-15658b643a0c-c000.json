The intermediate regime of the field\\nhas exotic behaviours, some of which are claimed to originate from a Kitaev\\nspin liquid. In resolving debates surrounding these behaviours, the interlayer\\ninteractions in $\\\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ have been largely overlooked due to their\\nperceived weakness in van der Waals materials. However, near the transition,\\nthey may become significant as the field energy approaches the interlayer\\ncoupling scale. Here we investigate the effects of interlayer couplings in\\n$\\\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ with $R\\\\bar{3}$ and $C2/m$ structures. We first examine their\\neffects on the transition temperature ($T_N$) using classical Monte Carlo\\nsimulations. We found that the interlayer couplings have minimal effects on\\n$T_N$, and the different $T_N$ between the two structures are mainly due to the\\nanisotropy in the intralayer interactions. Focusing on the $R{\\\\bar 3}$\\nstructure, we show that the nearest neighbour interlayer interaction is\\nXXZ-type due to the symmetry, and the next nearest neighbor interaction of the\\nKitaev-type is crucial for the transition between two zigzag orders under an\\nin-plane field. Furthermore, an intermediate phase with a large unit cell\\nemerges due to the interlayer interactions. Our findings provide new insights\\ninto the exotic behaviours and sample dependence reported in $\\\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T17:59:59Z\"}"}
