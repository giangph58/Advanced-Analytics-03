Data\\nfrom the ABIDE-II repository and Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R)\\nmetrics are used to form two ASD groups with tightly controlled demographics;\\none comprises subjects with scores above threshold for the self-injurious\\nbehaviors (SIBs) subscale, and the other subjects with scores below threshold\\nfor SIBs, but above threshold for at least one of the other subscales\\n(stereotyped, compulsive, ritualistic, insistence on sameness, restricted\\ninterests). The dynamics of the coherence for FCs across distinct frequency\\nbands are compared against matched controls, using a novel volatility measure\\ncomputed in time-frequency space. We find statistically significant\\ndifferences, on average, in the volatility of a relatively small set of FCs,\\nmost mapping to either the default mode network or the cerebellum, in the mid-\\nand high-frequency bands, and yielding higher volatility in subjects with high\\nlevels of SIBs. Results suggest a distinct underlying profile for SIBs\\ninvolving multiple brain regions associated with rewards and emotions\\nprocessing. The work contributes to the identification of neural substrates\\npotentially underlying behavioral subtypes, and may help target interventions.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.NC\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.NC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T13:46:11Z\"}"}
