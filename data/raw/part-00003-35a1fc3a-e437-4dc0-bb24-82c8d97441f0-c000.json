We extend\\nthe existing design of TUMA, developed for an additive white Gaussian channel,\\nto a more realistic environment with fading and multiple antennas.\\nSpecifically, we consider a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output\\nsystem and exploit spatial diversity to estimate the set of transmitted\\nmessages and the number of users transmitting each message. Our solution relies\\non a location-based codeword partition and on the use at the receiver of a\\nmultisource approximate message passing algorithm in both centralized and\\ndistributed implementations. The proposed TUMA framework results in a robust\\nand scalable architecture for massive machine-type communications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:24:46Z\"}"}
