{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11920v1\", \"title\": \"Lagrangian finite elements in Sobolev-like spaces of order $3/2$\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces a Sobolev-like space of order $3/2$, denoted as\\n$\\\\widehat{H}^{3/2}$, for Lagrangian finite elements, especially for $C^0$\\nelements. It is motivated by the limitations of current stability analysis of\\nthe evolving surface finite element method (ESFEM), which relies exclusively on\\nan energy estimate framework. To establish a PDE-based analysis framework for\\nESFEM, we encounter a fundamental regularity mismatch: the ESFEM adopts the\\n$C^0$ elements, while the PDE regularity theory requires $H^{3/2}$ regularity\\nfor solutions. To overcome this difficulty, we first examine the properties of\\nthe continuous $H^{3/2}$ space, then introduce a Dirichlet lift and Scott-Zhang\\ntype interpolation operators to bridge to the discrete $\\\\widehat{H}^{3/2}$\\nspace. Our new $\\\\widehat{H}^{3/2}$ space is shown to be compatible with the\\nelliptic PDE regularity theory, the trace inequality, and the inverse\\ninequality. Notably, we extend the critical domain deformation estimate in\\nESFEM to the $\\\\widehat{H}^{3/2}$ setting. The $\\\\widehat{H}^{3/2}$ theory\\nprovides a foundation for establishing a PDE-based convergence analysis\\nframework of ESFEM.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T09:56:43Z\"}"}
