However, achieving high-fidelity entanglement demands high accuracy\\nin two-qubit operations, requiring complex calibration protocols. In this work,\\nwe use a minimally calibrated two-qubit iSwap-like gate, tuned via\\nstraightforward parameter optimization (flux pulse amplitude and duration), to\\nprepare Bell states and GHZ states experimentally in systems of two and three\\ntransmon qubits. By integrating this gate into a variational quantum algorithm\\n(VQA), we bypass the need for intricate calibration while maintaining high\\nfidelity. Our proposed methodology employs variational quantum algorithms\\n(VQAs) to create the target quantum state through imperfect multiqubit\\noperations. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate a violation of the\\nClauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality for Bell states, confirming their\\nhigh fidelity of preparation.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T14:09:26Z\"}"}
