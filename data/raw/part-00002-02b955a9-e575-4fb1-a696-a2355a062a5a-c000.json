The proposed approach addresses the\\nchallenges of chattering, unknown disturbances, and rotational motion tracking,\\nmaking it suited for high-DOF manipulators in dexterous manipulation tasks. A\\nrigorous boundedness proof is provided, offering gain selection guidelines for\\npractical implementation. Simulations and hardware experiments with external\\ndisturbances demonstrate the proposed controller's robust, accurate tracking\\nwith reduced control effort under unknown disturbances compared to other\\nNT-STSM and conventional controllers. The results demonstrated that the\\nproposed NT-STSM controller mitigates chattering and instability in complex\\nmotions, making it a viable solution for dexterous robotic manipulations and\\nvarious industrial applications.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.RO,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T16:11:33Z\"}"}
