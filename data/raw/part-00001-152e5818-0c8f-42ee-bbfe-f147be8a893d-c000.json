{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05000v1\", \"title\": \"Energy Gap Modulation in Proximitized Superconducting Puddles of\\n  Graphene\", \"summary\": \"We investigated proximity-induced superconductivity in a graphene-insulating\\nInO bilayer system through gate-controlled transport measurements. Distinct\\noscillations in the differential conductance are observed across both the\\nelectron and hole doping regimes, with oscillation amplitudes increasing as the\\nchemical potential moves away from the Dirac point. These findings are\\nexplained using a theoretical model of a normal-superconductor-normal (NSN)\\njunction, which addresses reflection and transmission probabilities at normal\\nincidence. From this model, we extract key parameters for the proximitized\\ngraphene, including the superconducting energy gap Delta and the effective\\nlength scale Ls of the superconducting regions. Near the Dirac point, we\\nobserve a minimal Ls and a maximal Delta, aligning with the theory that the gap\\nin strongly disordered superconductors increases as the coherence length of\\nlocalized pairs decreases. This suggests that spatial confinement in a\\nlow-density superconductor leads to an effective increase in the\\nsuperconducting gap.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.dis-nn,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:27:11Z\"}"}
