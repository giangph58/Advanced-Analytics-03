Given a hereditary Hovey triple $(\\\\mathcal{C},\\n\\\\mathcal{W}, \\\\mathcal{F})$ in a weakly idempotent complete exact category. If\\none of the cotorsion pairs, $(\\\\mathcal{C}\\\\cap\\\\mathcal{W}, \\\\mathcal{F})$ and\\n$(\\\\mathcal{C}, \\\\mathcal{W}\\\\cap\\\\mathcal{F})$, is extendable, then there is a\\nchain of hereditary Hovey triples whose corresponding homotopy categories\\ncoincide. As applications, we obtain a new description of the unbounded derived\\ncategory $\\\\mathbf{D}(R)$ over a ring $R$. Moreover, we can interpret the\\nKrause's recollement in terms of ``$n$-dimensional'' homotopy categories.\\nFinally, we have two approaches to get ``$n$-dimensional'' hereditary Hovey\\ntriples, which are proved to coincide, in the category Rep$(Q,\\\\mathcal{A})$ of\\nall representations of a rooted quiver $Q$ with values in an abelian category\\n$\\\\mathcal{A}$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CT\", \"categories\": \"math.CT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T08:41:16Z\"}"}
