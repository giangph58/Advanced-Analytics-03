This study focuses on core algorithms that\\nsolve optimisation problems through the quadratic Ising or quadratic\\nunconstrained binary optimisation model, specifically quantum annealing and the\\nQuantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA).\\n  In particular, we estimate runtimes and scalability for the task of particle\\ntrack reconstruction, a key computing challenge in NHEP, and investigate how\\nthe classical parameter space in QAOA, along with techniques like a\\nFourier-analysis based heuristic, can facilitate future quantum advantages. The\\nfindings indicate that lower frequency components in the parameter space are\\ncrucial for effective annealing schedules, suggesting that heuristics can\\nimprove resource efficiency while achieving near-optimal results. Overall, the\\nstudy highlights the potential of NISQ computers in NHEP and the significance\\nof co-design approaches and heuristic techniques in overcoming challenges in\\nquantum algorithms.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T08:59:37Z\"}"}
