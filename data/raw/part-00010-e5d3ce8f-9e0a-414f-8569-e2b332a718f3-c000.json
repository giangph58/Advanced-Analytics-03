{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15946v1\", \"title\": \"The e-Partitioning Principle of False Discovery Rate Control\", \"summary\": \"We present a novel necessary and sufficient principle for False Discovery\\nRate (FDR) control. This e-Partitioning Principle says that a procedure\\ncontrols FDR if and only if it is a special case of a general e-Partitioning\\nprocedure. By writing existing methods as special cases of this procedure, we\\ncan achieve uniform improvements of these methods, and we show this in\\nparticular for the eBH, BY and Su methods. We also show that methods developed\\nusing the $e$-Partitioning Principle have several valuable properties. They\\ngenerally control FDR not just for one rejected set, but simultaneously over\\nmany, allowing post hoc flexibility for the researcher in the final choice of\\nthe rejected hypotheses. Under some conditions, they also allow for post hoc\\nadjustment of the error rate, choosing the FDR level $\\\\alpha$ post hoc, or\\nswitching to familywise error control after seeing the data. In addition,\\ne-Partitioning allows FDR control methods to exploit logical relationships\\nbetween hypotheses to gain power.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T14:45:23Z\"}"}
