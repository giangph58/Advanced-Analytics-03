{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21602v1\", \"title\": \"Real Time Semantic Segmentation of High Resolution Automotive LiDAR\\n  Scans\", \"summary\": \"In recent studies, numerous previous works emphasize the importance of\\nsemantic segmentation of LiDAR data as a critical component to the development\\nof driver-assistance systems and autonomous vehicles. However, many\\nstate-of-the-art methods are tested on outdated, lower-resolution LiDAR sensors\\nand struggle with real-time constraints. This study introduces a novel semantic\\nsegmentation framework tailored for modern high-resolution LiDAR sensors that\\naddresses both accuracy and real-time processing demands. We propose a novel\\nLiDAR dataset collected by a cutting-edge automotive 128 layer LiDAR in urban\\ntraffic scenes. Furthermore, we propose a semantic segmentation method\\nutilizing surface normals as strong input features. Our approach is bridging\\nthe gap between cutting-edge research and practical automotive applications.\\nAdditionaly, we provide a Robot Operating System (ROS2) implementation that we\\noperate on our research vehicle. Our dataset and code are publicly available:\\nhttps://github.com/kav-institute/SemanticLiDAR.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T13:00:50Z\"}"}
