Gfrerer and J. V. Outrata. In the setting of Banach spaces,\\nwe analyse its stability under Lipschitz continuous perturbations and establish\\nits uniformity over compact sets. Our results ensure that the property is\\npreserved under small Lipschitz perturbations, which is crucial for maintaining\\nrobustness in variational analysis. Furthermore, we apply the developed theory\\nto parametric inclusion problems. The analysis demonstrates that the uniformity\\nof strong metric subregularity provides a theoretical foundation for addressing\\nstability issues in parametrized optimization and control applications.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:05:02Z\"}"}
