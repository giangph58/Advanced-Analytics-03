Next, we investigate critical maps of\\nthe partial\\n  energy functionals, which are referred to as $\\\\overline{\\\\partial\\n}_{b}$-harmonic maps and $\\\\partial _{b}$-harmonic maps. We give a foliated\\nresult\\n  for both $\\\\overline{\\\\partial }_{b}$- and $\\\\partial _{b}$-harmonic maps,\\n  generalizing a foliated result of Petit \\\\cite{Pet2002harmonic} for harmonic\\nmaps. Then we\\n  are able to generalize Siu's holomorphicity result for harmonic maps\\n\\\\cite{Siu1980rigid}\\n  to the case for $\\\\overline{\\\\partial }_{b}$- and $\\\\partial _{b}$-harmonic\\n  maps.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T07:49:49Z\"}"}
