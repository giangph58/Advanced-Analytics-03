On minimal hypersurfaces with boundary, Fraser-Li\\nestablished an inequality giving a lower bound of the first Steklov eigenvalue\\nas a counterpart of the Choi-Wang type inequality. These inequalities were\\nshown under lower bounds of the Ricci curvature. In this paper, under\\nnon-negative Ricci curvature associated with an affine connection introduced by\\nWylie-Yeroshkin, we give a generalization of Fraser-Li type inequality. Our\\nresults hold not only for weighted manifolds under non-negative $1$-weighted\\nRicci curvature but also for substatic triples.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T16:02:32Z\"}"}
