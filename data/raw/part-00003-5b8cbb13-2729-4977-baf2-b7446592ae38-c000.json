Specifically, we investigate the Hodge Laplacian and related first\\norder systems like the div-curl systems, Hodge-Dirac systems, and\\nBogovskii-type problems in the context of variable exponent spaces. Our\\napproach yields both existence theorems and elliptic estimates. These estimates\\nprovide key results such as the Hodge decomposition theorem, Gaffney\\ninequality, and gauge fixing. These findings are crucial for advancing the\\nnonlinear theory related to problems involving differential forms.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:52:56Z\"}"}
