However, the stability of quantum spin liquids (QSL) against\\nsingle ion anisotropy (SIA) in these materials and the global quantum phase\\ndiagram of the extended spin-3/2 Kitaev model with finite SIA remain unclear.\\nIn this study, we perform large-scale density matrix renormalization group\\n(DMRG) to explore the quantum phase diagram of the generalized spin-3/2\\nKitaev-Heisenberg (K-H) model accompanied with SIA $A_c$. In the $A_c=0$ limit,\\nthe spin-3/2 K-H model exhibits a quantum phase diagram similar to that of a\\nspin-1/2 system, including two QSLs around antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic\\nKitaev models. For models with finite $A_c$, we map out the quantum phase\\ndiagram around two Kitaev points and observe distinct types of in-plane vortex\\norders developed from these two QSL phases. Interestingly, series of nearly\\ndegenerate vortex configurations are discovered in each vortex phases. Using\\nlinear spin-wave theory, we demonstrate that these vortex configurations can be\\nunderstood as a consequence of the quantum correction on a continuous family of\\ndegenerate classical states.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:58:20Z\"}"}
