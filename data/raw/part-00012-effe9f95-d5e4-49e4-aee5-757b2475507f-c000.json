{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00310v1\", \"title\": \"Statistical Learning for Heterogeneous Treatment Effects: Pretraining,\\n  Prognosis, and Prediction\", \"summary\": \"Robust estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects is a fundamental\\nchallenge for optimal decision-making in domains ranging from personalized\\nmedicine to educational policy. In recent years, predictive machine learning\\nhas emerged as a valuable toolbox for causal estimation, enabling more flexible\\neffect estimation. However, accurately estimating conditional average treatment\\neffects (CATE) remains a major challenge, particularly in the presence of many\\ncovariates. In this article, we propose pretraining strategies that leverages a\\nphenomenon in real-world applications: factors that are prognostic of the\\noutcome are frequently also predictive of treatment effect heterogeneity. In\\nmedicine, for example, components of the same biological signaling pathways\\nfrequently influence both baseline risk and treatment response. Specifically,\\nwe demonstrate our approach within the R-learner framework, which estimates the\\nCATE by solving individual prediction problems based on a residualized loss. We\\nuse this structure to incorporate \\\"side information\\\" and develop models that\\ncan exploit synergies between risk prediction and causal effect estimation. In\\nsettings where these synergies are present, this cross-task learning enables\\nmore accurate signal detection: yields lower estimation error, reduced false\\ndiscovery rates, and higher power for detecting heterogeneity.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ML\", \"categories\": \"stat.ML,cs.LG,stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T05:12:14Z\"}"}
