Nevertheless, they often fail to capture critical non-linearities\\ninherent in real-world systems. In this work, we present a unified framework\\nfor solving discrete-time game problems with higher-order state and strategy\\ncosts involving power-law terms. We derive semi-explicit expressions for\\nequilibrium strategies, cost-to-go functions, and recursive coefficient\\ndynamics across deterministic, stochastic, and multi-agent system settings by\\nconvex-completion techniques. The contributions include variance-aware\\nsolutions under additive and multiplicative noise, extensions to\\nmean-field-type-dependent dynamics, and conditions that ensure the positivity\\nof recursive coefficients. Our results provide a foundational methodology for\\nanalyzing non linear multi-agent systems under higher-order penalization,\\nbridging classical game theory and mean-field-type game theory with modern\\ncomputational tools for engineering applications.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T06:48:35Z\"}"}
