We consider a\\nQNN architecture based on previous research and point out shortcomings in the\\nparametrization of the atomic environments, that limits its expressivity as an\\ninteratomic potential and precludes transferability between molecules. We\\npropose a revised QNN architecture that addresses these shortcomings. While\\nboth QNNs show promise in force prediction, with the revised architecture\\nshowing improved accuracy, they struggle with energy prediction. Further, both\\nQNNs architectures fail to demonstrate a meaningful scaling law of decreasing\\nerrors with increasing training data. These findings highlight the challenges\\nof scaling QNNs for complex molecular systems and emphasize the need for\\nimproved encoding strategies, regularization techniques, and hybrid\\nquantum-classical approaches.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T06:02:12Z\"}"}
