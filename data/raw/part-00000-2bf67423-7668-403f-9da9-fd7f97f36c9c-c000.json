We\\naddress this challenge under recursive maximum likelihood decoding (RMLD) using\\na rein-forcement learning approach based on the Gumbel AlphaZero algorithm. The\\nresulting method, PolarZero, consistently matches exhaustive search in\\nidentifying low-complexity kernels, and discovers a size-16 kernel with\\ncomplexity comparable to handcrafted designs. Our results suggest that\\nPolarZero is a scalable tool for large-kernel design, where brute-force search\\nis no longer feasible.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T04:48:26Z\"}"}
