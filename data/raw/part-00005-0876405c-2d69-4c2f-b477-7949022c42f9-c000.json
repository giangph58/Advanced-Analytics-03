{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24349v1\", \"title\": \"Faster Releases, Fewer Risks: A Study on Maven Artifact Vulnerabilities\\n  and Lifecycle Management\", \"summary\": \"In modern software ecosystems, dependency management plays a critical role in\\nensuring secure and maintainable applications. However, understanding the\\nrelationship between release practices and their impact on vulnerabilities and\\nupdate cycles remains a challenge. In this study, we analyze the release\\nhistories of 10,000 Maven artifacts, covering over 203,000 releases and 1.7\\nmillion dependencies. We evaluate how release speed affects software security\\nand lifecycle. Our results show an inverse relationship between release speed\\nand dependency outdatedness. Artifacts with more frequent releases maintain\\nsignificantly shorter outdated times. We also find that faster release cycles\\nare linked to fewer CVEs in dependency chains, indicating a strong negative\\ncorrelation. These findings emphasize the importance of accelerated release\\nstrategies in reducing security risks and ensuring timely updates. Our research\\nprovides valuable insights for software developers, maintainers, and ecosystem\\nmanagers.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:32:45Z\"}"}
