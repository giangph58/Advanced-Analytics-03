Its recent\\norganization under the Brazilian Network for High-Energy Physics (RENAFAE),\\nsince 2008, has further strengthened its scientific and technological goals,\\nparticularly in detector instrumentation, computing, and industry partnerships.\\nIn 2024, Brazil became an Associate Member State of CERN, opening new\\nopportunities for deeper engagement in accelerator and detector R&D. This input\\nto the 2026 update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics highlights\\nBrazil's current participation in LHC experiments as well as ongoing\\ndevelopments in detector and accelerator technology, and details the\\ncommunity's view towards future colliders. The potential for expanded\\nscientific and industrial collaborations between Brazil and CERN is also\\ndiscussed.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:41:38Z\"}"}
