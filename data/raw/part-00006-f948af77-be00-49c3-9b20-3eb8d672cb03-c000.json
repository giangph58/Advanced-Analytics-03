{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16886v1\", \"title\": \"Exploring zero-shot structure-based protein fitness prediction\", \"summary\": \"The ability to make zero-shot predictions about the fitness consequences of\\nprotein sequence changes with pre-trained machine learning models enables many\\npractical applications. Such models can be applied for downstream tasks like\\ngenetic variant interpretation and protein engineering without additional\\nlabeled data. The advent of capable protein structure prediction tools has led\\nto the availability of orders of magnitude more precomputed predicted\\nstructures, giving rise to powerful structure-based fitness prediction models.\\nThrough our experiments, we assess several modeling choices for structure-based\\nmodels and their effects on downstream fitness prediction. Zero-shot fitness\\nprediction models can struggle to assess the fitness landscape within\\ndisordered regions of proteins, those that lack a fixed 3D structure. We\\nconfirm the importance of matching protein structures to fitness assays and\\nfind that predicted structures for disordered regions can be misleading and\\naffect predictive performance. Lastly, we evaluate an additional\\nstructure-based model on the ProteinGym substitution benchmark and show that\\nsimple multi-modal ensembles are strong baselines.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.QM\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.QM,cs.LG,q-bio.BM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T17:01:09Z\"}"}
