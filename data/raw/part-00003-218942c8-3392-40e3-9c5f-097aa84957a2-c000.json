We prove that if for a subgroup\\n$\\\\mu_d$ of $d-$th roots of unity we have $A-A=\\\\mu_d\\\\cup\\\\{0\\\\}$, then $d=2$ or\\n$6$. We also establish the truth of S\\\\'ark\\\\\\\"ozy's conjecture on quadratic\\nresidues: for all primes $p$ the set $\\\\mathcal R_p$ of quadratic residues\\nmodulo $p$ cannot be represented as $A+B$ for sets $A,B$ with\\n$\\\\min(|A|,|B|)>1$. In a more general setting, we prove that if $d-$th roots of\\nunity $\\\\mu_d$ are represented non-trivially as $A+B$, then the sizes of\\nsummands are equal.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T13:11:20Z\"}"}
