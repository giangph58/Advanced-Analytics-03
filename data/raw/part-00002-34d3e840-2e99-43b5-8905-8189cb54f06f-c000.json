{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11932v1\", \"title\": \"Technological Complexity Based on Japanese Patent Data\", \"summary\": \"As international competition intensifies in technologies, nations need to\\nidentify key technologies to foster innovation. However, the identification is\\ndifficult because a technology is independent, therefore has complex nature.\\nHere, this study aims to assess patent technological fields by applying\\nTechnological Complexity Index from a corporate perspective, addressing its\\nunderutilization in Japan despite its potential. By utilizing carefully\\nprocessed patent data from fiscal years 1981 to 2010, we analyze the bipartite\\nnetwork which consists of 1,938 corporations and 35 or 124 technological\\nfields. Our findings provide quantitative characteristics of ubiquity and\\nsophistication for patent fields, the detailed technological trends that\\nreflect the social context, and methodological stability for policymakers and\\nresearchers, contributing to targeted innovation strategies in Japan.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SI\", \"categories\": \"cs.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T10:12:00Z\"}"}
