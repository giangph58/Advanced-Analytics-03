When it comes\\nto adverse effects in clinical trials, these are often most adequately handled\\nusing survival methods. A common-effect model that is able to process data in\\ncommonly quoted formats in terms of hazard ratios has been proposed for this\\npurpose by Holzhauer (Stat. Med. 2017; 36(5):723-737). In order to accommodate\\npotential heterogeneity between studies, we have extended the model by\\nHolzhauer to a random-effects approach. The Bayesian model is described in\\ndetail, and applications to realistic data sets are discussed along with\\nsensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations to support the conclusions.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T16:06:05Z\"}"}
