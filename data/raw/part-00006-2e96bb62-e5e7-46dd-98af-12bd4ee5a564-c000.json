This paper considers a\\nsecure gradient coding problem, where a user aims to compute the sum of the\\ngradients from $K$ datasets with the assistance of $N$ distributed servers. The\\nuser should recover the sum of gradients by receiving transmissions from any\\n$N_r$ servers, and each dataset is assigned to $N - N_r + m$ servers. The\\nsecurity constraint guarantees that even if the user receives transmissions\\nfrom all servers, it cannot obtain any additional information about the\\ndatasets beyond the sum of gradients.\\n  It has been shown in the literature that this security constraint does not\\nincrease the optimal communication cost of the gradient coding problem,\\nprovided enough source keys are shared among the servers. However, the minimum\\nrequired source key size that ensures security while maintaining this optimal\\ncommunication cost has only been studied for the special case $m = 1$. In this\\npaper, we focus on the more general case $m \\\\geq 1$ and aim to determine the\\nminimum required source key size for this purpose.\\n  We propose a new information-theoretic converse bound on the source key size,\\nas well as a new achievable scheme with carefully designed data assignments.\\nOur scheme outperforms the existing optimal scheme based on the widely used\\ncyclic data assignment and coincides with the converse bound under certain\\nsystem parameters.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T11:37:31Z\"}"}
