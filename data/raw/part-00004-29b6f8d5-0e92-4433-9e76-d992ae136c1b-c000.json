{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16787v1\", \"title\": \"Credible plan-driven RAG method for Multi-hop Question Answering\", \"summary\": \"Multi-hop question answering (QA) presents a considerable challenge for\\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), requiring the structured decomposition of\\ncomplex queries into logical reasoning paths and the generation of dependable\\nintermediate results. However, deviations in reasoning paths or errors in\\nintermediate results, which are common in current RAG methods, may propagate\\nand accumulate throughout the reasoning process, diminishing the accuracy of\\nthe answer to complex queries. To address this challenge, we propose the\\nPlan-then-Act-and-Review (PAR RAG) framework, which is organized into three key\\nstages: planning, act, and review, and aims to offer an interpretable and\\nincremental reasoning paradigm for accurate and reliable multi-hop question\\nanswering by mitigating error propagation.PAR RAG initially applies a top-down\\nproblem decomposition strategy, formulating a comprehensive plan that\\nintegrates multiple executable steps from a holistic viewpoint. This approach\\navoids the pitfalls of local optima common in traditional RAG methods, ensuring\\nthe accuracy of the entire reasoning path. Subsequently, PAR RAG incorporates a\\nplan execution mechanism based on multi-granularity verification. By utilizing\\nboth coarse-grained similarity information and fine-grained relevant data, the\\nframework thoroughly checks and adjusts intermediate results, ensuring process\\naccuracy while effectively managing error propagation and amplification.\\nExperimental results on multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that the PAR RAG\\nframework substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in key\\nmetrics, including EM and F1 scores.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI,I.2.0\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:03:17Z\"}"}
