{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06183v1\", \"title\": \"Primordial Features in light of the Effective Field Theory of Large\\n  Scale Structure\", \"summary\": \"While the simplest inflationary models predict a power-law form of the\\nprimordial power spectrum (PPS), various UV complete scenarios predict features\\non top of the standard power law that leave characteristic imprints in the\\nlate-time distribution of matter, encoded in the galaxy power spectrum. In this\\nwork, we assess the validity of the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale\\nStructure (EFTofLSS) and the IR-resummation scheme of PyBird in the context of\\nprimordial (oscillatory) features. We find an excellent agreement at the level\\nof the matter power spectrum between N-body simulations and the one-loop EFT\\npredictions, for models commonly studied in the literature. We then apply the\\nEFTofLSS to the galaxy power spectrum measurements from BOSS LRG and eBOSS QSO\\nto constrain specific global and local features in the PPS. We demonstrate that\\nwhile such features can improve the fit to cosmic microwave background (CMB)\\ndata, they may result in a poorer fit to clustering measurements at low\\nredshift. The resulting constraints on the amplitude of the primordial\\noscillations are competitive with those obtained from CMB data, despite the\\nwell-known damping of oscillations due to non-linear structure formation\\nprocesses. For the first time in this context, we jointly analyze the galaxy\\npower spectrum (monopole and quadrupole) in combination with Planck CMB data to\\nderive strong constraints on the amplitude of primordial features. This work\\nhighlights the EFTofLSS as a powerful tool for testing early universe scenarios\\non scales that complement CMB observations.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T16:23:36Z\"}"}
