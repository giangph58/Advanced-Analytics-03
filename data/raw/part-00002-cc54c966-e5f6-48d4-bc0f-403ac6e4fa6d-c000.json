By both symmetry analysis and\\nmicroscopic methods we show that there is an additional term - a rotary\\ninvariant - in the superconducting free energy which allows for magnetoelectric\\neffects even when the previously considered Lifshitz invariant vanishes. We\\nshow that the size, shape, and position of these vortices can be controlled by\\nmanipulating Rashba spin-orbit coupling in the weak link, via gates, and we\\nsuggest that these vortices could be detected via scanning magnetometry\\ntechniques. We also show that the transverse triplet components of the\\nsuperconducting correlations can form a texture.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T17:56:00Z\"}"}
