Our main result is a new sub-leading double soft pion theorem in\\ntheories with a spontaneously-broken continuous 2-group global symmetry, which\\nintertwines amplitudes with different numbers of pions and photons. We also\\nprovide a novel derivation of the leading soft photon theorem from the Ward\\nidentity of an emergent 1-form global symmetry in effective field theories\\nwhere antiparticles are integrated out. Our derivations of these soft theorems\\nuse the algebra of spacetime currents and do not rely on asymptotic symmetries\\nor diagrammatic arguments.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T14:22:23Z\"}"}
