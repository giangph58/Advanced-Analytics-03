{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14828v1\", \"title\": \"Variational quantum algorithm for the Poisson equation based on the\\n  banded Toeplitz systems\", \"summary\": \"For solving the Poisson equation it is usually possible to discretize it into\\nsolving the corresponding linear system $Ax=b$.Variational quantum algorithms\\n(VQAs) for the discreted Poisson equation have been studied before. We give a\\nVQA based on the banded Toeplitz systems for solving the Poisson equation with\\nrespect to the structural features of matrix $A$. In detail, we decompose the\\nmatrix $A$ and $A^2$ into a linear combination of the corresponding banded\\nToeplitz matrix and sparse matrices with only a few non-zero elements. For the\\none-dimensional Poisson equation with different boundary conditions and the\\n$d$-dimensional Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions, the number\\nof decomposition terms is less than the work in [Phys. Rev. A 108, 032418\\n(2023)]. Based on the decomposition of the matrix, we design quantum circuits\\nthat evaluate efficiently the cost function.Additionally, numerical simulation\\nverifies the feasibility of the proposed algorithm. In the end, the VQAs for\\nlinear systems of equations and matrix-vector multiplications with $K$-banded\\nTeoplitz matrix $T_n^K$ are given, where $T_n^K\\\\in R^{n\\\\times n}$ and $K\\\\in\\nO({\\\\rm ploy}\\\\log n)$.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T03:07:49Z\"}"}
