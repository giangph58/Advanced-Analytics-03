Due to the\\nappearance of the vacuum, the momentum equation are both degenerate in the time\\nevolution and spatial dissipation, which makes the study on the well-posedness\\nchallenged. By establishing some new singular-weighted (negative powers of the\\ndensity $\\\\rho$) estimates of the solution, we establish the local-in-time\\nwell-posedness of the regular solution with far-field vacuum in terms of\\n$\\\\rho$, the velocity $u$ and the entropy $S$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T10:58:53Z\"}"}
