{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01507v1\", \"title\": \"Grasping by Spiraling: Reproducing Elephant Movements with Rigid-Soft\\n  Robot Synergy\", \"summary\": \"The logarithmic spiral is observed as a common pattern in several living\\nbeings across kingdoms and species. Some examples include fern shoots,\\nprehensile tails, and soft limbs like octopus arms and elephant trunks. In the\\nlatter cases, spiraling is also used for grasping. Motivated by how this\\nstrategy simplifies behavior into kinematic primitives and combines them to\\ndevelop smart grasping movements, this work focuses on the elephant trunk,\\nwhich is more deeply investigated in the literature. We present a soft arm\\ncombined with a rigid robotic system to replicate elephant grasping\\ncapabilities based on the combination of a soft trunk with a solid body. In our\\nsystem, the rigid arm ensures positioning and orientation, mimicking the role\\nof the elephant's head, while the soft manipulator reproduces trunk motion\\nprimitives of bending and twisting under proper actuation patterns. This\\nsynergy replicates 9 distinct elephant grasping strategies reported in the\\nliterature, accommodating objects of varying shapes and sizes. The synergistic\\ninteraction between the rigid and soft components of the system minimizes the\\ncontrol complexity while maintaining a high degree of adaptability.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:57:10Z\"}"}
