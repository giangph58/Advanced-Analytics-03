We first study the\\nasymptotic behavior of the solution to the state equation and get a family of\\nperiodic measures depending on time variables within a period from the\\nconvergence of transition probabilities. Then, with the help of periodic\\nmeasures and periodic Riccati equations, we transform the ergodic cost\\nfunctional on infinite horizon into an equivalent cost functional on a single\\nperiodic interval without limit, and present the closed-loop optimal controls\\nfor our concerned control system. Finally, an example is given to demonstrate\\nthe applications of our theoretical results.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:36:32Z\"}"}
