{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03152v1\", \"title\": \"Observation of optical vortex generation via magnon-induced Brillouin\\n  light scattering\", \"summary\": \"Exploration of physics involving orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light,\\nfirst recognized in 1992, is essential for deepening our understanding of the\\ninteraction between light and matter and that opens up new applications. In\\nsystems with rotational symmetry, it is known that OAM can be exchanged between\\nlight and matter. One of the most common applications of such a phenomenon is\\nmanipulating the optical OAM through the exchange of OAM between light and a\\nnematic liquid crystal-based spatial light modulator (SLM). It is already being\\nused as a tool in many studies related to the optical OAM. However, the\\noperation bandwidth is limited by the response speed 100 Hz of the liquid\\ncrystal, which hinders the applications of the optical OAM to spatial division\\nmultiplexing, quantum communication, and optical microscopy. The generation of\\noptical vortex beams with the optical OAM in inelastic scattering by elementary\\nexcitations with gigahertz-order resonance may solve this problem, although it\\nhas not been studied so far. Here, we demonstrate the generation of the optical\\nvortex beams using magnon-induced Brillouin light scattering. We observe\\nscattering rules in the Brillouin light scattering which can be explained by\\nconservation of total angular momentum including spins and orbits with photons\\nand magnons. This work serves as a starting point for research into the\\ninteraction between optical vertices and magnons. It opens up devices with the\\nnovel mechanism of optical OAM generation together with high operation\\nbandwidth.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T03:57:24Z\"}"}
