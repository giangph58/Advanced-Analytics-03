A fully-mixed formulation of Biot's poroelasticity\\nproblem has the advantage of producing a better approximation of the Darcy\\nvelocity and stress field, as well as satisfying local mass and momentum\\nconservation. In this work, we focus on a novel four-fields Virtual Element\\ndiscretization of Biot's equations. The stress symmetry is strongly imposed in\\nthe definition of the discrete space, thus avoiding the use of an additional\\nLagrange multiplier. A complete a priori analysis is performed, showing the\\nrobustness of the proposed numerical method with respect to limiting material\\nproperties. The first order convergence of the lowest-order fully-discrete\\nnumerical method, which is obtained by coupling the spatial approximation with\\nthe backward Euler time-advancing scheme, is confirmed by a complete 3D\\nnumerical validation. A well known poroelasticity benchmark is also considered\\nto assess the robustness properties and computational performance.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T16:42:50Z\"}"}
