{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24095v1\", \"title\": \"Threats and Opportunities in AI-generated Images for Armed Forces\", \"summary\": \"Images of war are almost as old as war itself. From cave paintings to\\nphotographs of mobile devices on social media, humans always had the urge to\\ncapture particularly important events during a war. Images provide visual\\nevidence. For armed forces, they may serve as the output of a sensor (e.g. in\\naerial reconnaissance) or as an effector on cognition (e.g. in form of\\nphotographic propaganda). They can inform, influence, or even manipulate a\\ntarget audience. The recent advancements in the field of generative Artificial\\nIntelligence (AI) to synthesize photorealistic images give rise to several new\\nchallenges for armed forces. The objective of this report is to investigate the\\nrole of AI-generated images for armed forces and provide an overview on\\nopportunities and threats. When compared with traditional image generation\\n(e.g. photography), generative AI brings distinct conceptual advantages to\\nimplement new tactical tenets and concepts which so far have not been feasible:\\nmasses of AI-generated images can be used for deceptive purposes, to influence\\nthe pace of combat in the information environment, to cause surprise, sow\\nconfusion and shock. AI-generated images are a tool favoured for offensive\\nmanoeuvres in the information environment. To prepare for future challenges\\ninvolving AI-generated images and improve their resilience, recommendations are\\ngiven at the end of the report for all branches of the armed forces, who are\\nactive in cyber defense and/or exposed to the information environment.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:46:02Z\"}"}
