{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07871v1\", \"title\": \"Episodically adapted network-based controllers\", \"summary\": \"We consider the problem of distributing a control policy across a network of\\ninterconnected units. Distributing controllers in this way has a number of\\npotential advantages, especially in terms of robustness, as the failure of a\\nsingle unit can be compensated by the activity of others. However, it is not\\nobvious a priori how such network-based controllers should be constructed for\\nany given system and control objective. Here, we propose a synthesis procedure\\nfor obtaining dynamical networks that enact well-defined control policies in a\\nmodel-free manner. We specifically consider an augmented state space consisting\\nof both the plant state and the network states. Solution of an optimization\\nproblem in this augmented state space produces a desired objective and\\nspecification of the network dynamics. Because of the analytical tractability\\nof this method, we are able to provide convergence and robustness assessments\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:45:17Z\"}"}
