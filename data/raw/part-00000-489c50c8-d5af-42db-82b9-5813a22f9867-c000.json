The two models share the feature that the focusing and\\ndefocusing effects convert periodically. For the classical focusing NLS, it is\\nknown that the initial data $$ u_0(x)=T^{-\\\\frac{d}{2}}\\\\fe^{i\\\\frac{|x|^2}{4T}\\n-i\\\\frac{\\\\omega^2}{T}}Q_\\\\omega\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{T}\\\\right) $$ leads to a blowup\\nsolution $$(T-t)^{-\\\\frac{d}{2}}\\\\fe^{i\\\\frac{|x|^2}{4(T-t)}\\n-i\\\\frac{\\\\omega^2}{T-t}}Q_\\\\omega\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{T-t}\\\\right), $$ so when $T\\\\leq1$,\\nthis is also a blowup solution for DM-NLS and NM-NLS which blows up in the\\nfirst focusing layer.\\n  For DM-NLS, we prove that when $T>1$, the initial data $u_0$ above does not\\nlead to a finite-time blowup and the corresponding solution is globally\\nwell-posed. For NM-NLS, we prove the global well-posedness for $T\\\\in(1,2)$ and\\nwe construct solution that can blow up at any focusing layer. The theoretical\\nstudies are complemented by extensive numerical explorations towards\\nunderstanding the stabilization effects in the two models and addressing their\\ndifference.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,cs.NA,math.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T04:36:58Z\"}"}
