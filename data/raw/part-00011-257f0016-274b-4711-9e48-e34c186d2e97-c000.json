Traditional methods for tracking food intake rely on\\nself-reported data before or after the eating, which are prone to inaccuracies.\\nThis study proposes an approach to accurately monitor ingest behaviours by\\nleveraging 3D food models constructed from monocular 2D video. Using COLMAP and\\npose estimation algorithms, we generate detailed 3D representations of food,\\nallowing us to observe changes in food volume as it is consumed. Experiments\\nwith toy models and real food items demonstrate the approach's potential.\\nMeanwhile, we have proposed a new methodology for automated state recognition\\nchallenges to accurately detect state changes and maintain model fidelity. The\\n3D reconstruction approach shows promise in capturing comprehensive dietary\\nbehaviour insights, ultimately contributing to the development of automated and\\naccurate dietary monitoring tools.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T15:35:42Z\"}"}
