While retrieval-augmented generation\\n(RAG) improves accuracy by grounding LLMs in external data, it fails to address\\nthe core challenges of trustworthy analytics - especially when processing\\nnoisy, inconsistent, or multi-modal data (for example, text, tables, images).\\nWe propose DataMosaic, a framework designed to make LLM-powered analytics both\\nexplainable and verifiable. By dynamically extracting task-specific structures\\n(for example, tables, graphs, trees) from raw data, DataMosaic provides\\ntransparent, step-by-step reasoning traces and enables validation of\\nintermediate results. Built on a multi-agent framework, DataMosaic orchestrates\\nself-adaptive agents that align with downstream task requirements, enhancing\\nconsistency, completeness, and privacy. Through this approach, DataMosaic not\\nonly tackles the limitations of current LLM-powered analytics systems but also\\nlays the groundwork for a new paradigm of grounded, accurate, and explainable\\nmulti-modal data analytics.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:38:23Z\"}"}
