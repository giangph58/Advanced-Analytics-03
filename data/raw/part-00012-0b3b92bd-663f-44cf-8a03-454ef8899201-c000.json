Mixing the specific properties of matter excitations and light\\nmodes has proven to be an efficient strategy to alter a variety of molecular\\nprocesses ranging from chemical reactions to exciton transport. Here, we\\ninvestigate energy transfer in a plexcitonic system of zinc phthalocyanine\\n(ZnPc) molecules aggregated in the crystalline {\\\\alpha}-phase and an SPP on a\\nplain gold surface. By tuning the angle of incidence, we vary the degree of\\nmixing between excitonic and SPP character of the excited state. We apply our\\nrecently developed higher-order pump-probe spectroscopy to separate the\\nsystem's fifth-order signal describing the dynamics of two-particle\\ninteractions. The time it takes for two quasiparticles to meet and annihilate\\nis a measure of their movement and thus the transport of excitation energy in\\nthe system. We find that the transport extracted from the fifth-order signal is\\nsurprisingly unaffected by the mixing ratio of exciton and SPP contributions of\\nthe plexciton. Using a rate equation model, we explain this behavior by fast\\ntransition from the plexcitonic states to many localized excitonic dark states\\nthat do not have an SPP contribution. Our results give an indication of how\\nhybrid exciton-plasmon systems should be designed to exploit the delocalization\\nof the involved plasmon modes for improved transport.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph,cond-mat.mes-hall,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T09:21:23Z\"}"}
