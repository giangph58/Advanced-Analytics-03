This work demonstrates an\\nimproved scheme that enables this certification using only a maximally mixed\\nstate, rather than traversing over all states, making it experimental feasible.\\nIn this scheme, outcomes obtained from sequential measurements are used for the\\nevaluation of the worst result and its certification threshold, based on the\\ncharacteristics of maximally mixed state and a semi-definite program.\\nExperimentally, a group of projectors closely approximating the KS set Peres-24\\nis certified in an optical system, highlighting the feasibility of this scheme\\nin certifying KS set. Furthermore, a quantitative analysis is presented by\\nmanually adding errors to the optical system, demonstrating a strict level of\\nexperimental imperfection in achieving successful certification. These results\\noffer a new perspective on characterizing measurements from quantum devices.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T07:52:19Z\"}"}
