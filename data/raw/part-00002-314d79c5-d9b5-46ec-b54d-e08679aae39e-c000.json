{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19679v1\", \"title\": \"Non-Classical Spin-Phonon Correlations Induced by Rydberg Facilitation\\n  in a Lattice\", \"summary\": \"We investigate the interplay between mechanical forces and the internal-state\\ndynamics of a chain of Rydberg atoms trapped in tweezer arrays under the\\nfacilitation constraint. Dipole interactions between Rydberg atoms couple\\nelectronic (spin) degrees of freedom with excited motional (phonon) states. We\\nshow that this interaction leads to highly correlated and non-classical phonon\\nstates in the form of squeezed center of mass position states of the Rydberg\\natoms. Coupling with either a normal or an inverted Lennard-Jones-type\\npotential, resulting from an avoided crossing of Rydberg potential curves,\\nleads to in-phase or out-of-phase correlated oscillations in the atom positions\\nrespectively. Furthermore, the growth dynamics of a finite cluster of excited\\nRydberg atoms can be mapped to the dynamics of a single particle in a\\nsemi-infinite lattice subject to a linear potential gradient caused by\\nspin-phonon interactions. This results in Bloch oscillations in the spin\\ncluster size, which in turn localize spin excitations in the system.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T11:09:46Z\"}"}
