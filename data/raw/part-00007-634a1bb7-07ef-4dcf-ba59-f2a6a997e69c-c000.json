{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04614v1\", \"title\": \"Axion Dark Matter Archaeology with Primordial Gravitational Waves\", \"summary\": \"We investigate the complementary information to be gained from inflationary\\ngravitational wave (IGW) signals and searches for QCD axion dark matter. We\\nfocus on post-inflationary Peccei-Quinn (PQ) breaking axion models that are\\ncosmologically safe. Recent work has shown that a greater number of such models\\nexist. This is because the heavy quarks required for the colour anomaly can\\nprovoke a period of heavy quark domination (HQD), which, through decay, dilutes\\nthe axion abundance. In this work we show for the first time that the axion\\ndark matter mass can be as low as $m_a\\\\sim10^{-8}\\\\,{\\\\rm eV}$ for models where\\nthe heavy quarks decay via dimension 6 terms. This is achieved by allowing the\\nmass of the heavy quarks to differ from the axion decay constant, $m_Q\\\\neq\\nf_a$. Consequently, the observables that would distinguish between pre- and\\npost-inflationary PQ breaking, $m_a$ and the additional relativistic degrees of\\nfreedom $\\\\Delta N_{\\\\rm eff}$, now become indiscernible. To solve this, we\\npropose using blue-tilted IGWs to probe HQD. By leveraging the features of the\\nGW signal, future interferometers can probe $m_Q$ and $f_a$ complementing the\\nsensitivity of haloscope experiments, potentially pinning down all relevant\\nparameter that describe the physics. Specifically, we find that BBO and ET GW\\ndetectors will both be able to optimistically probe $f_a\\\\gtrsim 10^{14}\\\\,{\\\\rm\\nGeV}$.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T17:57:14Z\"}"}
