However, it is often the case that data in\\nspectroscopy is scarce, and this usually causes severe overfitting problems\\nwith deep learning methods. Traditional machine learning methods are viable\\nwhen datasets are smaller, but the accuracy and applicability of these methods\\nis generally more limited.\\n  We introduce a deep learning method for classification of molecular spectra\\nbased on learning integral operators via integral equations of the first kind,\\nwhich results in an algorithm that is less affected by overfitting issues on\\nsmall datasets, compared to other deep learning models.\\n  The problem formulation of the deep learning approach is based on inverse\\nproblems, which have traditionally found important applications in\\nspectroscopy. We perform experiments on real world data to showcase our\\nalgorithm. It is seen that the model outperforms traditional machine learning\\napproaches such as decision tree and support vector machine, and for small\\ndatasets it outperforms other deep learning models. Therefore, our methodology\\nleverages the power of deep learning, still maintaining the performance when\\nthe available data is very limited, which is one of the main issues that deep\\nlearning faces in spectroscopy, where datasets are often times of small size.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T16:22:46Z\"}"}
