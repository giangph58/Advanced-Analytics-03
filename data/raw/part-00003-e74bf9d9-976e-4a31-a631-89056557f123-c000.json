{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19581v1\", \"title\": \"SAMBLE: Shape-Specific Point Cloud Sampling for an Optimal Trade-Off\\n  Between Local Detail and Global Uniformity\", \"summary\": \"Driven by the increasing demand for accurate and efficient representation of\\n3D data in various domains, point cloud sampling has emerged as a pivotal\\nresearch topic in 3D computer vision. Recently, learning-to-sample methods have\\ngarnered growing interest from the community, particularly for their ability to\\nbe jointly trained with downstream tasks. However, previous learning-based\\nsampling methods either lead to unrecognizable sampling patterns by generating\\na new point cloud or biased sampled results by focusing excessively on sharp\\nedge details. Moreover, they all overlook the natural variations in point\\ndistribution across different shapes, applying a similar sampling strategy to\\nall point clouds. In this paper, we propose a Sparse Attention Map and\\nBin-based Learning method (termed SAMBLE) to learn shape-specific sampling\\nstrategies for point cloud shapes. SAMBLE effectively achieves an improved\\nbalance between sampling edge points for local details and preserving\\nuniformity in the global shape, resulting in superior performance across\\nmultiple common point cloud downstream tasks, even in scenarios with few-point\\nsampling.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T08:42:24Z\"}"}
