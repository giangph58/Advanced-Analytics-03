{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04316v1\", \"title\": \"On local fields invariant under the action of topological defects\", \"summary\": \"In the context of rational conformal field theories (RCFT) we look into the\\nproblem of constructing and classifying pairs consisting of a local operator\\nand a topological defect which commutes or anticommutes with it. We discuss the\\nbulk and boundary versions of the problem. In the latter one considers a\\nconformal boundary condition, a boundary operator on it and a junction with a\\ntopological defect. In the case of the charge conjugation modular invariant\\ncommuting configurations in each problem can be obtained when a certain\\nrestriction on the fusion rules in realised. We study the corresponding fusion\\nrule problems in detail. While in the bulk case it reduces to realising the\\n$a\\\\times b = c$ fusion rule which was studied in arXiv:2012.14689 [hep-th], in\\nthe boundary it leads to a new type of problem. We obtain a full solution to\\nthis problem for the $\\\\mathrm{SU(3)}$ WZW theory, thus constructing a class of\\ncommuting boundary operators and junctions in that theory, and suggest an\\napproach to general WZW theories.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T11:03:56Z\"}"}
