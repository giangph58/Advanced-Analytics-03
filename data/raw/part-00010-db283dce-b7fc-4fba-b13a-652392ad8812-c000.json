{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04804v1\", \"title\": \"DebGCD: Debiased Learning with Distribution Guidance for Generalized\\n  Category Discovery\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we tackle the problem of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD).\\nGiven a dataset containing both labelled and unlabelled images, the objective\\nis to categorize all images in the unlabelled subset, irrespective of whether\\nthey are from known or unknown classes. In GCD, an inherent label bias exists\\nbetween known and unknown classes due to the lack of ground-truth labels for\\nthe latter. State-of-the-art methods in GCD leverage parametric classifiers\\ntrained through self-distillation with soft labels, leaving the bias issue\\nunattended. Besides, they treat all unlabelled samples uniformly, neglecting\\nvariations in certainty levels and resulting in suboptimal learning. Moreover,\\nthe explicit identification of semantic distribution shifts between known and\\nunknown classes, a vital aspect for effective GCD, has been neglected. To\\naddress these challenges, we introduce DebGCD, a \\\\underline{Deb}iased learning\\nwith distribution guidance framework for \\\\underline{GCD}. Initially, DebGCD\\nco-trains an auxiliary debiased classifier in the same feature space as the GCD\\nclassifier, progressively enhancing the GCD features. Moreover, we introduce a\\nsemantic distribution detector in a separate feature space to implicitly boost\\nthe learning efficacy of GCD. Additionally, we employ a curriculum learning\\nstrategy based on semantic distribution certainty to steer the debiased\\nlearning at an optimized pace. Thorough evaluations on GCD benchmarks\\ndemonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art performance of our framework,\\nhighlighting its superiority.
