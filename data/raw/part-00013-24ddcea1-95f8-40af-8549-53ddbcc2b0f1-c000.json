To this end, we quantify the impact of\\nSMEFT operators modifying double Higgs production at the LHC and single Higgs\\nproduction, including loop corrections, at the FCC-ee, and include\\nRenormalisation Group Evolution throughout. We demonstrate that significantly\\nimproving on the legacy HL-LHC constraints on $\\\\kappa_3$ at the FCC-ee is not\\npossible without the $\\\\sqrt{s}=365$ GeV run; that individual and marginalised\\ndeterminations are similar at the HL-LHC while differing by up to a factor 3 at\\nthe FCC-ee; and that quadratic EFT corrections cannot be neglected. Overall,\\nthe combination of HL-LHC and FCC-ee data offers unique potential to pin down\\nthe Higgs self-coupling with $\\\\sim$$15\\\\%$ precision.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:30:44Z\"}"}
