To overcome this challenge, we consider\\nparallel repetitions of the recently proposed routed Bell experiments, where\\ntransmissions from the source are actively directed either to a nearby or a\\ndistant measurement device. We analytically show that the threshold detection\\nefficiency of the distant device--needed to certify non-jointly-measurable\\nmeasurements, a prerequisite of secure DIQKD--decreases exponentially,\\noptimally, and robustly, following $\\\\eta^*=1/2^N$, with the number $N$ of\\nparallel repetitions.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:44:41Z\"}"}
