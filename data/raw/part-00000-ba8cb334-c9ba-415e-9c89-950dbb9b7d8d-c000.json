{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10299v1\", \"title\": \"IRR-Based AS Type of Relationship Inference\", \"summary\": \"The Internet comprises tens of thousands of autonomous systems (ASes) whose\\ncommercial relationships are not publicly announced. The classification of the\\nType of Relationship (ToR) between ASes has been extensively studied over the\\npast two decades due to its relevance in network routing management and\\nsecurity.\\n  This paper presents a new approach to ToR classification, leveraging publicly\\navailable BGP data from the Internet Routing Registry (IRR). We show how the\\nIRR can be mined and the results refined to achieve a large and accurate ToR\\ndatabase. Using a ground truth database with hundreds of entries we show that\\nwe indeed manage to obtain high accuracy. About two-thirds of our ToRs are new,\\nnamely, they were not obtained by previous works, which means that we enrich\\nour ToR knowledge with links that are otherwise missed.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T15:08:42Z\"}"}
