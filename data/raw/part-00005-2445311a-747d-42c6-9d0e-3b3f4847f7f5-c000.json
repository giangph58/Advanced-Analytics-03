It is known that\\nthe system is stable below a critical mass, which depends on the gravitational\\nconstant, while it becomes unstable if the total mass exceeds the critical\\nmass. We prove that if the total mass is at the critical mass, then the HFB\\nminimizers do not exist for any gravitational constant, while the HF minimizers\\nexist for every gravitational constant except for a countable set, which is\\nfully characterized by the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality for orthonormal\\nsystems. Our results complement the existence results in the sub-critical mass\\ncase established in [E. Lenzmann and M. Lewin, Duke Math. J., 2010].\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T07:21:00Z\"}"}
