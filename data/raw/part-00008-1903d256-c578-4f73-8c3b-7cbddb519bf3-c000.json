However,\\nthe practical utility of NFs remains limited by their tendency to collapse to a\\nsingle mode of a multimodal distribution. In this study, we show that annealing\\nwith an adaptive schedule based on the effective sample size (ESS) can mitigate\\nmode collapse. We demonstrate that our approach can converge the marginal\\nlikelihood for a biochemical oscillator model fit to time-series data in\\nten-fold less computation time than a widely used ensemble Markov chain Monte\\nCarlo (MCMC) method. We show that the ESS can also be used to reduce variance\\nby pruning the samples. We expect these developments to be of general use for\\nsampling with NFs and discuss potential opportunities for further improvements.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,physics.comp-ph,physics.data-an,q-bio.QM,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:58:48Z\"}"}
