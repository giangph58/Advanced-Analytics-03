{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00465v1\", \"title\": \"HoneyWin: High-Interaction Windows Honeypot in Enterprise Environment\", \"summary\": \"Windows operating systems (OS) are ubiquitous in enterprise Information\\nTechnology (IT) and operational technology (OT) environments. Due to their\\nwidespread adoption and known vulnerabilities, they are often the primary\\ntargets of malware and ransomware attacks. With 93% of the ransomware targeting\\nWindows-based systems, there is an urgent need for advanced defensive\\nmechanisms to detect, analyze, and mitigate threats effectively. In this paper,\\nwe propose HoneyWin a high-interaction Windows honeypot that mimics an\\nenterprise IT environment. The HoneyWin consists of three Windows 11 endpoints\\nand an enterprise-grade gateway provisioned with comprehensive network traffic\\ncapturing, host-based logging, deceptive tokens, endpoint security and\\nreal-time alerts capabilities. The HoneyWin has been deployed live in the wild\\nfor 34 days and receives more than 5.79 million unsolicited connections, 1.24\\nmillion login attempts, 5 and 354 successful logins via remote desktop protocol\\n(RDP) and secure shell (SSH) respectively. The adversary interacted with the\\ndeceptive token in one of the RDP sessions and exploited the public-facing\\nendpoint to initiate the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) brute-force bot\\nattack via SSH sessions. The adversary successfully harvested 1,250 SMTP\\ncredentials after attempting 151,179 credentials during the attack.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T11:31:18Z\"}"}
