Using the\\nMisner-Sharp formalism with an excision technique, our simulations extend to\\nsignificantly later times than previous work and indicate that the\\nnear-critical perturbations produce a distinct compression wave featuring both\\noverdense and underdense shells, while significantly supercritical\\nperturbations yield only an underdense shell. We also show that a softer\\nequation of state suppresses the formation of compression waves. Furthermore,\\nthe comoving thickness of sound shells remains nearly constant during\\npropagation and scales with the Hubble radius at horizon re-entry, thereby\\nserving as a key link between the gravitational-wave peak frequency and PBH\\nmass in the companion letter. These results offer new insights into the\\ndynamics of PBH formation and suggest potential observational signatures of\\nPBHs in the gravitational wave spectrum from associated sound waves.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.CO,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T16:47:42Z\"}"}
