However, few studies on\\nfighting game agents have focused explicitly on enhancing player enjoyment, a\\ncritical factor for both developers and players. To address this gap and\\nestablish a practical baseline for designing enjoyability-focused agents, we\\npropose a two-tier agent (TTA) system and conducted experiments in the classic\\nfighting game Street Fighter II. The first tier of TTA employs a task-oriented\\nnetwork architecture, modularized reward functions, and hybrid training to\\nproduce diverse and skilled DRL agents. In the second tier of TTA, a Large\\nLanguage Model Hyper-Agent, leveraging players' playing data and feedback,\\ndynamically selects suitable DRL opponents. In addition, we investigate and\\nmodel several key factors that affect the enjoyability of the opponent. The\\nexperiments demonstrate improvements from 64. 36% to 156. 36% in the execution\\nof advanced skills over baseline methods. The trained agents also exhibit\\ndistinct game-playing styles. Additionally, we conducted a small-scale user\\nstudy, and the overall enjoyment in the player's feedback validates the\\neffectiveness of our TTA system.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T03:38:06Z\"}"}
