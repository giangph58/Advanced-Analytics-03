This decision aims to accommodate a set of agents\\nwith private positions in $[0,1]$ and approval preferences over the facilities;\\nthe agents act strategically and may misreport their private information to\\nmaximize their utility, which depends on the chosen facility and their distance\\nfrom it. We focus on strategyproof mechanisms that incentivize the agents to\\nact truthfully and bound the best possible approximation of the optimal social\\nwelfare (the total utility of the agents) they can achieve. We first show that\\ndeterministic mechanisms have unbounded approximation ratio, and then present a\\nrandomized mechanism with approximation ratio $k$, which is tight even when\\nagents may only misreport their positions. For the restricted setting where\\nagents may only misreport their approval preferences, we design a deterministic\\nmechanism with approximation ratio of roughly $2.325$, and establish lower\\nbounds of $3/2$ and $6/5$ for deterministic and randomized mechanisms,\\nrespectively.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GT\", \"categories\": \"cs.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T10:14:22Z\"}"}
