As a main corollary, we show that a compact\\nK\\\\\\\"{a}hler manifold $(X,g)$ with $k$-semi-positive Ricci curvature and\\n$\\\\mathrm{rd}(X)\\\\leq n-k$ actually has semi-positive Ricci curvature and\\n$\\\\mathrm{rd}(X)\\\\geq \\\\nu(-K_X)$. Of independent interest, we also confirm the\\nrational connectedness of compact K\\\\\\\"{a}hler manifolds with positive orthogonal\\nRicci curvature, among other results.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG,math.AG,math.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:56:57Z\"}"}
