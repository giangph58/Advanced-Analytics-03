In\\nthis study, we explore their behavior in a higher-dimensional environment,\\nwhich itself is non-trivial - a topological vacuum. In particular, we embed a\\none-dimensional topological wire within a two-dimensional Chern insulator,\\nallowing the zero-dimensional edge modes of the wire to interplay with the\\nsurrounding chiral boundary states created by the environment. In contrast to a\\ntrivial vacuum, we show depending on the nature of low energy modes, the\\ntopology of the environment selectively influences the topological phase\\ntransitions of the wire. Interestingly, such selectivity leads to scenarios\\nwhere the environment trivializes the wire and even induces topological\\ncharacter in an otherwise trivial phase - an example of `proximity-induced\\ntopology'. Using both numerical and analytical approaches, we establish the\\ngeneral framework of such embedding and uncover the role of symmetries in\\nshaping the fate of low-energy theories. Our findings will provide a deeper\\nunderstanding of heterostructural topological systems, paving the way for their\\nexperimental exploration.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.str-el,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T16:32:29Z\"}"}
