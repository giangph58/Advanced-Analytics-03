These\\nneighbour exchanges are irreversible rearrangements crossing an energy barrier.\\nHere, by an exact geometric construction, I determine this energy barrier for\\ngeneral, isolated T1 transitions dominated by line tensions. I show how\\ndeviations from regular cell packing reduce this energy barrier, but find that\\nline tension fluctuations increase it on average. By another exact\\nconstruction, I show how nonlinear tensions in vertex models of epithelial\\ntissues also resist T1 transitions. My results thus form the basis for\\ncoarse-grained descriptions of cell neighbour exchanges in continuum models of\\nepithelia.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,physics.bio-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T14:34:34Z\"}"}
