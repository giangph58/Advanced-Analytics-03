The shared task's objective is to evaluate\\nexplainable classification systems for classifying hazards and products in two\\nlevels of granularity from food recall incident reports. In this work, we\\npropose text augmentation techniques as a way to improve poor performance on\\nminority classes and compare their effect for each category on various\\ntransformer and machine learning models. We explore three word-level data\\naugmentation techniques, namely synonym replacement, random word swapping, and\\ncontextual word insertion. The results show that transformer models tend to\\nhave a better overall performance. None of the three augmentation techniques\\nconsistently improved overall performance for classifying hazards and products.\\nWe observed a statistically significant improvement (P < 0.05) in the\\nfine-grained categories when using the BERT model to compare the baseline with\\neach augmented model. Compared to the baseline, the contextual words insertion\\naugmentation improved the accuracy of predictions for the minority hazard\\nclasses by 6%. This suggests that targeted augmentation of minority classes can\\nimprove the performance of transformer models.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T12:34:28Z\"}"}
