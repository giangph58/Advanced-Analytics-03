We discuss unitarity bounds\\nfor $N \\\\to M$ (with $N,M \\\\geq 2$) scattering processes -- relevant for\\nhigh-energy future colliders -- and spin-2 or higher-spin theories -- relevant\\nfor effective field theories of gravity -- that are not approachable by\\nstandard methods. Moreover, we emphasize the power and complementarity of\\npositivity and partial wave unitarity bounds to constrain the parameter space\\nof effective field theories.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T11:22:34Z\"}"}
