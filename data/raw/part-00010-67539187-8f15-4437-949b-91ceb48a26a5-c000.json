{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21296v1\", \"title\": \"Fairness in Graph Learning Augmented with Machine Learning: A Survey\", \"summary\": \"Augmenting specialised machine learning techniques into traditional graph\\nlearning models has achieved notable success across various domains, including\\nfederated graph learning, dynamic graph learning, and graph transformers.\\nHowever, the intricate mechanisms of these specialised techniques introduce\\nsignificant challenges in maintaining model fairness, potentially resulting in\\ndiscriminatory outcomes in high-stakes applications such as recommendation\\nsystems, disaster response, criminal justice, and loan approval. This paper\\nsystematically examines the unique fairness challenges posed by Graph Learning\\naugmented with Machine Learning (GL-ML). It highlights the complex interplay\\nbetween graph learning mechanisms and machine learning techniques, emphasising\\nhow the augmentation of machine learning both enhances and complicates\\nfairness. Additionally, we explore four critical techniques frequently employed\\nto improve fairness in GL-ML methods. By thoroughly investigating the root\\ncauses and broader implications of fairness challenges in this rapidly evolving\\nfield, this work establishes a robust foundation for future research and\\ninnovation in GL-ML fairness.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T04:02:23Z\"}"}
