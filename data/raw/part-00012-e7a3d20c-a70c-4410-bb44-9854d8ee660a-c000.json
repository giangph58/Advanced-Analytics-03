We develop a new family of life-time distributions\\nusing a scale mixture of the generalized gamma distributions, where we propose\\na novel super heavy-tailed distribution as a mixing density. We theoretically\\nshow that, under some conditions, the proposed method satisfies the full\\nposterior robustness, which guarantees robustness of point estimation as well\\nas uncertainty quantification. For posterior computation, we employ an integral\\nexpression of the proposed heavy-tailed distribution to develop an efficient\\nposterior computation algorithm based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo. The\\nperformance of the proposed method is illustrated through numerical experiments\\nand real data example.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T12:48:23Z\"}"}
