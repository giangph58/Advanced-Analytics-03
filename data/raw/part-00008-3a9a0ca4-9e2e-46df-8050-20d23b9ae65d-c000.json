{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19514v1\", \"title\": \"FSBench: A Figure Skating Benchmark for Advancing Artistic Sports\\n  Understanding\", \"summary\": \"Figure skating, known as the \\\"Art on Ice,\\\" is among the most artistic sports,\\nchallenging to understand due to its blend of technical elements (like jumps\\nand spins) and overall artistic expression. Existing figure skating datasets\\nmainly focus on single tasks, such as action recognition or scoring, lacking\\ncomprehensive annotations for both technical and artistic evaluation. Current\\nsports research is largely centered on ball games, with limited relevance to\\nartistic sports like figure skating. To address this, we introduce FSAnno, a\\nlarge-scale dataset advancing artistic sports understanding through figure\\nskating. FSAnno includes an open-access training and test dataset, alongside a\\nbenchmark dataset, FSBench, for fair model evaluation. FSBench consists of\\nFSBench-Text, with multiple-choice questions and explanations, and\\nFSBench-Motion, containing multimodal data and Question and Answer (QA) pairs,\\nsupporting tasks from technical analysis to performance commentary. Initial\\ntests on FSBench reveal significant limitations in existing models'\\nunderstanding of artistic sports. We hope FSBench will become a key tool for\\nevaluating and enhancing model comprehension of figure skating.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T06:25:04Z\"}"}
