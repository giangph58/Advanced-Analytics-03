By tuning the\\ncontrol parameter, one transitions from uniformly distributed weights to an\\noptimal transport regime in which weights condense onto cost-favorable edges.\\nWe quantify this dense-to-sparse transition, showing with numerical analyses\\nthat the process does not hinge on specific assumptions about the node-strength\\nor cost distributions. Finite-size analysis confirms that the results persist\\nin the thermodynamic limit. Because the model offers explicit control over the\\ndegree of sub-optimality, this approach lends to practical applications in link\\nprediction, network reconstruction, and statistical validation, particularly in\\nsystems where partial optimization coexists with other noise-like factors.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:36:45Z\"}"}
