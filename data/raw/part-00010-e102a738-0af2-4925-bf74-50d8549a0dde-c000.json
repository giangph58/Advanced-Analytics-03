Our approach follows a two-stage strategy: a\\nreliable baseline retrieval system using a fine-tuned embedding model and an\\nLLM-based reranker. Our key contribution is demonstrating how LLM-based\\ntranslation can overcome the hurdles of multilingual information retrieval.\\nAdditionally, we focus on ensuring that the bulk of the pipeline can be\\nreplicated on a consumer GPU. Our final integrated system achieved a success@10\\nscore of 0.938 and 0.81025 on the monolingual and crosslingual test sets,\\nrespectively.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T11:34:35Z\"}"}
