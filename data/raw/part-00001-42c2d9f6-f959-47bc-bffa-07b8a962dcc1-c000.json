{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17429v1\", \"title\": \"Wide-angle Scanning Heterogeneous Element-Based Phased Array Using Novel\\n  Scanning Envelope Synthesis Method\", \"summary\": \"Two novel methods, including the scanning envelope synthesis (SES) method and\\nthe active reflection self-cancellation (ARC) method, are proposed to design\\nwide-angle scanning heterogeneous element phased arrays. Heterogeneous strategy\\nis efficient to extend scanning range but quantitatively characterization of\\nthe effect is critically needed to guide design for achieving desired\\nperformance. The proposed SES method derives theoretically the relationship\\nbetween scanning range and the 3dB-beamwidth of the pattern envelope of one\\nphased array, which is linear superposition of active radiation pattern (AEP)\\nmagnitude of each element. Therefore, the contribution of each kind of\\nheterogeneity can be quantitatively analyzed for further enhancing the scanning\\nrange. As we see, a high active reflection coefficient of the phased array can\\ndirectly reduce the realized gain. In this way, one ARC method is proposed to\\nreduce the active reflection coefficient by counteracting the reflection\\ncomponent of active reflection coefficient with its transmission component,\\nthereby keeping the realized gain efficiently even when the array scans at\\nlarge angels. For verification, one 24.5-29.5GHz 4x4 phased array scanning in\\nE-plane is designed and fabricated. Benefiting from the proposed SES method,\\nthe scanning range of the prototype is extended up to $\\\\pm74\\\\deg$, around\\n10{\\\\deg} improvement over one traditional heterogeneous array. Meanwhile, the\\nactive reflection coefficient is reduced from -4dB to lower than -7.5dB by\\napplying the ARC method.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T10:43:33Z\"}"}
