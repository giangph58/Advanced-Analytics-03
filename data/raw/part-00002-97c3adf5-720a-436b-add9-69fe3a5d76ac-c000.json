Dwarf\\ngalaxies, such as Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte (WLM) and Sextans A, provide valuable\\nlaboratories for testing distance scales across different stellar populations.\\nIn this work, we utilize the high sensitivity and spatial resolution of the\\nJames Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to measure the distances to WLM and Sextans A\\nusing the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) method. Adopting the TRGB absolute\\nmagnitude calibrated by NGC 4258, we determine distance moduli of\\n$\\\\mu_{\\\\mathrm{0,WLM}} = 24.977 \\\\pm 0.018 (\\\\mathrm{stat}) \\\\pm 0.056\\n(\\\\mathrm{sys})$ mag for WLM and $\\\\mu_{\\\\mathrm{0,SexA}} = 25.740 \\\\pm 0.011\\n(\\\\mathrm{stat}) \\\\pm 0.057 (\\\\mathrm{sys})$ mag for Sextans A. Our results are\\nconsistent within a 3% distance uncertainty with previous measurements based on\\nTRGB, Cepheids, and J-Region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) methods. With\\nimproved distance measurements in the future, these two galaxies have the\\npotential to serve as additional anchor points for TRGB calibration, aiming to\\nreduce the TRGB-based distance uncertainty to below 2%.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T13:21:29Z\"}"}
