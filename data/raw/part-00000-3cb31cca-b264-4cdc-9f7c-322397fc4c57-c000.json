To\\naddress this, a curvature-based knee identification method was proposed in our\\nprevious work [1]. Here, we further validate its effectiveness on a new battery\\naging dataset under a realistic driving profile and conduct spectral analysis\\nof the approximated capacity fade curvature. The curvature-based method shows\\nconsistent knee identification performance on this dataset and the approximated\\ncurvature is found to correlate with underlying degradation modes and a shift\\nof electrode material phase transition points. The method uses capacity data as\\nthe only input, which is easy to acquire in the lab and it is applicable in\\nbattery energy storage systems for grid applications.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T12:51:45Z\"}"}
