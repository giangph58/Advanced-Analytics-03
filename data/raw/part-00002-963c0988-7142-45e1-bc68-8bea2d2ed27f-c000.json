We study procurement problems in which\\nthe buyer's valuation of the supplied good depends directly on its quality,\\nwhich is unverifiable and unobservable to the buyer. For a broad class of\\nprocurement problems, we identify procurement mechanisms maximizing any\\nweighted average of the buyer's expected payoff and social surplus. The optimal\\nmechanism can be implemented by an auction that restricts sellers to submit\\nbids within specific intervals.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.TH\", \"categories\": \"econ.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T03:19:02Z\"}"}
