The close to 4:2:1 period\\ncommensurability of the planets, the available long-term monitoring of the\\nsystem and new very high-precision radial velocity measurements from ESPRESSO\\nenable the determination of masses from the planet-planet interaction. Using\\nnested sampling, we derived parameter distributions for a co-planar\\nconfiguration. The three planets (Mb =1.07 +- 0.11M_Earth, Pb =3.2073 +- 0.0003\\nd, Mc=1.76 +- 0.13M_Earth, Pc=6.6821 +- 0.0008 d, Md =1.55 +- 0.17M_Earth, Pd\\n=13.066 +- 0.002 d) are potentially all rocky with equilibrium temperatures\\nbetween 360 K and 240 K. This makes the GJ1061 system one of the prime targets\\nfor future ground or space based instruments suitable for a direct detection of\\nthe planetary atmospheres.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T07:12:03Z\"}"}
