This\\nanalysis uses dijets as a proxy for the parton-parton scattering configuration,\\ncorrelating it with event geometry estimators, namely the energy deposited in\\nthe Zero-Degree Calorimeter and the transverse energy recorded in the Forward\\nCalorimeter in the Pb-going direction. The analysis uses data recorded by the\\nATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider with a nucleon-nucleon\\ncenter-of-mass energy of 8.16 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of\\n56 nb$^{-1}$. The jets are measured within the pseudorapidity interval $-$2.8\\n$<$ $\\\\eta$ $<$ 4.5, where positive $\\\\eta$ values correspond to the direction of\\nthe proton beam. Results are presented as a function of the Bjorken-$x$ of the\\nparton originating from the proton, $x_{p}$. Both event geometry estimators are\\nfound to be dependent on $x_{p}$, with the energy deposited in the Zero-Degree\\nCalorimeter about six times less sensitive to $x_{p}$ compared with the\\ntransverse energy deposited in the Forward Calorimeter.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-ex\", \"categories\": \"nucl-ex,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:34:40Z\"}"}
