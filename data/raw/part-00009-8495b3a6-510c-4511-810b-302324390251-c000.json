The latter is determined via a closed-loop control and\\nis proven to yield exponential decay of the entropy of the particle system. The\\nanalysis is carried out through kinetic equations for interacting particle\\nsystems describing the simulated annealing method in an extended phase space.\\nDecay estimates are derived under the quasi-invariant scaling of the resulting\\nsystem of Boltzmann-type equations to assess the consistency with their\\nmean-field limit. Numerical results are provided to illustrate and support the\\ntheoretical findings.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,nlin.AO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T10:50:24Z\"}"}
