{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07406v1\", \"title\": \"Towards Generalizability to Tone and Content Variations in the\\n  Transcription of Amplifier Rendered Electric Guitar Audio\", \"summary\": \"Transcribing electric guitar recordings is challenging due to the scarcity of\\ndiverse datasets and the complex tone-related variations introduced by\\namplifiers, cabinets, and effect pedals. To address these issues, we introduce\\nEGDB-PG, a novel dataset designed to capture a wide range of tone-related\\ncharacteristics across various amplifier-cabinet configurations. In addition,\\nwe propose the Tone-informed Transformer (TIT), a Transformer-based\\ntranscription model enhanced with a tone embedding mechanism that leverages\\nlearned representations to improve the model's adaptability to tone-related\\nnuances. Experiments demonstrate that TIT, trained on EGDB-PG, outperforms\\nexisting baselines across diverse amplifier types, with transcription accuracy\\nimprovements driven by the dataset's diversity and the tone embedding\\ntechnique. Through detailed benchmarking and ablation studies, we evaluate the\\nimpact of tone augmentation, content augmentation, audio normalization, and\\ntone embedding on transcription performance. This work advances electric guitar\\ntranscription by overcoming limitations in dataset diversity and tone modeling,\\nproviding a robust foundation for future research.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SD\", \"categories\": \"cs.SD,eess.AS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T03:01:14Z\"}"}
