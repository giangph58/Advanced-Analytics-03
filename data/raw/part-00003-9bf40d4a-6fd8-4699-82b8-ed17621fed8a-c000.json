{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04276v1\", \"title\": \"HDiffTG: A Lightweight Hybrid Diffusion-Transformer-GCN Architecture for\\n  3D Human Pose Estimation\", \"summary\": \"We propose HDiffTG, a novel 3D Human Pose Estimation (3DHPE) method that\\nintegrates Transformer, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), and diffusion model\\ninto a unified framework. HDiffTG leverages the strengths of these techniques\\nto significantly improve pose estimation accuracy and robustness while\\nmaintaining a lightweight design. The Transformer captures global\\nspatiotemporal dependencies, the GCN models local skeletal structures, and the\\ndiffusion model provides step-by-step optimization for fine-tuning, achieving a\\ncomplementary balance between global and local features. This integration\\nenhances the model's ability to handle pose estimation under occlusions and in\\ncomplex scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce lightweight optimizations to the\\nintegrated model and refine the objective function design to reduce\\ncomputational overhead without compromising performance. Evaluation results on\\nthe Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets demonstrate that HDiffTG achieves\\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the MPI-INF-3DHP dataset while excelling\\nin both accuracy and computational efficiency. Additionally, the model exhibits\\nexceptional robustness in noisy and occluded environments.
