Our main contribution is a new continuous-time\\nformulation of sorting as a gradient flow on the permutohedron, yielding an\\nindependent proof of the classical $\\\\Omega(n \\\\log n)$ lower bound for\\ncomparison-based sorting. This formulation reveals how exponential contraction\\nof disorder occurs under simple geometric dynamics. In support of this\\nanalysis, we present algebraic, combinatorial, and geometric perspectives,\\nincluding decision-tree arguments and linear constraints on the permutohedron.\\nThe idea that efficient sorting arises from structure-guided logarithmic\\nreduction offers a unifying lens for how comparisons tame exponential spaces.\\nThese observations connect to broader questions in theoretical computer\\nscience, such as whether the existence of structure can explain why certain\\ncomputational problems permit efficient solutions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T13:38:00Z\"}"}
