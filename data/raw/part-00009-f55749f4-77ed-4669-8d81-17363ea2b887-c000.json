{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01416v1\", \"title\": \"DF-Calib: Targetless LiDAR-Camera Calibration via Depth Flow\", \"summary\": \"Precise LiDAR-camera calibration is crucial for integrating these two sensors\\ninto robotic systems to achieve robust perception. In applications like\\nautonomous driving, online targetless calibration enables a prompt sensor\\nmisalignment correction from mechanical vibrations without extra targets.\\nHowever, existing methods exhibit limitations in effectively extracting\\nconsistent features from LiDAR and camera data and fail to prioritize salient\\nregions, compromising cross-modal alignment robustness. To address these\\nissues, we propose DF-Calib, a LiDAR-camera calibration method that\\nreformulates calibration as an intra-modality depth flow estimation problem.\\nDF-Calib estimates a dense depth map from the camera image and completes the\\nsparse LiDAR projected depth map, using a shared feature encoder to extract\\nconsistent depth-to-depth features, effectively bridging the 2D-3D cross-modal\\ngap. Additionally, we introduce a reliability map to prioritize valid pixels\\nand propose a perceptually weighted sparse flow loss to enhance depth flow\\nestimation. Experimental results across multiple datasets validate its accuracy\\nand generalization,with DF-Calib achieving a mean translation error of 0.635cm\\nand rotation error of 0.045 degrees on the KITTI dataset.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T07:09:44Z\"}"}
