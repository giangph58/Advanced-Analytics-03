{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02520v1\", \"title\": \"Beyond Traditional Coherence Time: An Electromagnetic Perspective for\\n  Mobile Channels\", \"summary\": \"Channel coherence time has been widely regarded as a critical parameter in\\nthe design of mobile systems. However, a prominent challenge lies in\\nintegrating electromagnetic (EM) polarization effects into the derivation of\\nthe channel coherence time. In this paper, we develop a framework to analyze\\nthe impact of polarization mismatch on the channel coherence time.\\nSpecifically, we first establish an EM channel model to capture the essence of\\nEM wave propagation. Based on this model, we then derive the EM temporal\\ncorrelation function, incorporating the effects of polarization mismatch and\\nbeam misalignment. Further, considering the random orientation of the mobile\\nuser equipment (UE), we derive a closed-form solution for the EM coherence time\\nin the turning scenario. When the trajectory degenerates into a straight line,\\nwe also provide a closed-form lower bound on the EM coherence time. The\\nsimulation results validate our theoretical analysis and reveal that neglecting\\nthe EM polarization effects leads to overly optimistic estimates of the EM\\ncoherence time.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T12:17:30Z\"}"}
