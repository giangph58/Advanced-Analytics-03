The same for the maxima. It is natural to\\nask, are there any other times ``adapted'' to $X$ exhibiting this ``symmetric\\nsplitting'' property? It appears that the phenomenon is most conveniently\\ncouched in terms of the ``noise'' structure associated to $X$. At the level of\\ngenerality of the latter, an equivalent set-theoretic condition for the\\nsymmetric splitting property is provided, leading to the observation that the\\nanswer to the elucidated question is to the affirmative. While we do not deal\\nmuch with the obvious analog of the phenomenon in continuous time, the discrete\\nfindings do beg the question: does linear Brownian motion admit times of\\nsymmetric splitting other than the maxima and minima? This is left unresolved,\\nbut we do make some comments as to why it may be non-trivial/interesting.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:05:23Z\"}"}
