QGen Studio enables users to leverage large language\\nmodels (LLMs) to create custom question-answer datasets and fine-tune models on\\nthis synthetic data. It features a dataset viewer and model explorer to\\nstreamline this process. The dataset viewer provides key metrics and visualizes\\nthe context from which the QA pairs are generated, offering insights into data\\nquality. The model explorer supports model comparison, allowing users to\\ncontrast the performance of their trained LLMs against other models, supporting\\nperformance benchmarking and refinement. QGen Studio delivers an interactive,\\nend-to-end solution for generating QA datasets and training scalable,\\ndomain-adaptable models. The studio will be open-sourced soon, allowing users\\nto deploy it locally.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T15:32:09Z\"}"}
