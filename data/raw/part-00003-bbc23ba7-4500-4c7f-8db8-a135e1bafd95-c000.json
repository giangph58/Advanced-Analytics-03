Throughout the\\nconsultation process, AggregateEU has been mocked as `Tinder of the European\\ngas markets' as it helps consumers and suppliers to find partners, but leaves\\nit up to the matched partners to decide whether or not to contract on the\\npossible trade. The non-commitment nature leads to substantial overbidding and\\nmany non-realised matches.\\n  We propose a quantitative modelling framework to study the effect of\\noverbidding in the AggergateEU demand aggregation or joint purchasing\\nmechanism. We conclude that the mechanism is prone to overbidding and that\\noverbidding has ambiguous effects on trade. Depending on the parameters,\\noverbidding may facilitate trade, but may also result in highly inefficient\\noutcomes when overbidding is combined with a miscoordination over the delivery\\npoints.\\n  Suggested remedies include allowing for convex bids, restrictions on\\noverbidding, or giving up part of the non-binding character of the market.\\n%Ideally, the traditional mechanisms of gas exchanges should be augmented by\\nfeatures of AggregateEU.
