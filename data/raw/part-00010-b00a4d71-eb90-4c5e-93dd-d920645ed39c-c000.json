We also demonstrate that the vanishing of the growth rate of the volume\\nof extremal surfaces provides a sharp diagnostic of the black hole singularity.\\nIn static, uncharged, spherically symmetric spacetimes, this corresponds to the\\ngrowth rate of spacelike extremal surfaces going to zero at the singularity. In\\ncharged or rotating spacetimes, such as the Reissner-Nordstr\\\\\\\"om and Kerr black\\nholes, we identify novel timelike extremal surfaces that exhibit the same\\nbehavior at the timelike singularity.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T12:56:04Z\"}"}
