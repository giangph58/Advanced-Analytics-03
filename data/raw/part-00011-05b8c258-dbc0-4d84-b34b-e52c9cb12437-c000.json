In this paper, we initiate the investigation of the\\nspatial properties of the SHF. We prove that, as a random measure on\\n$\\\\mathbb{R}^2$, it is a.s. singular w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure. This is\\nobtained by probing a \\\"quasi-critical\\\" regime and showing the asymptotic\\nlog-normality of the mass assigned to vanishing balls, as the disorder strength\\nis sent to zero at a suitable rate, accompanied by similar results for critical\\n2D directed polymers. We also describe the regularity of the SHF, showing that\\nit is a.s. H\\\\\\\"older $C^{-\\\\epsilon}$ for any $\\\\epsilon>0$, implying the absence\\nof atoms, and we establish local convergence to zero in the long time limit.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T15:21:44Z\"}"}
