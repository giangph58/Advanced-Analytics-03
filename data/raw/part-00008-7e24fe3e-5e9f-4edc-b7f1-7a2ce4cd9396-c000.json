{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01940v1\", \"title\": \"Strengthening Multi-Robot Systems for SAR: Co-Designing Robotics and\\n  Communication Towards 6G\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents field-tested use cases from Search and Rescue (SAR)\\nmissions, highlighting the co-design of mobile robots and communication systems\\nto support Edge-Cloud architectures based on 5G Standalone (SA). The main goal\\nis to contribute to the effective cooperation of multiple robots and first\\nresponders. Our field experience includes the development of Hybrid Wireless\\nSensor Networks (H-WSNs) for risk and victim detection, smartphones integrated\\ninto the Robot Operating System (ROS) as Edge devices for mission requests and\\npath planning, real-time Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) via\\nMulti-Access Edge Computing (MEC), and implementation of Uncrewed Ground\\nVehicles (UGVs) for victim evacuation in different navigation modes. These\\nexperiments, conducted in collaboration with actual first responders,\\nunderscore the need for intelligent network resource management, balancing\\nlow-latency and high-bandwidth demands. Network slicing is key to ensuring\\ncritical emergency services are performed despite challenging communication\\nconditions. The paper identifies architectural needs, lessons learned, and\\nchallenges to be addressed by 6G technologies to enhance emergency response\\ncapabilities.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T17:47:11Z\"}"}
