Here, we consider Gaussian lossy\\nchannels varying from one use to another and we employ neural networks to\\nclassify, regress, and forecast the behavior of these channels from their\\nChoi-Jamiolkowski states. The networks achieve at least 87% of accuracy in\\ndistinguishing between non-Markovian, Markovian, memoryless, compound, and\\ndeterministic channels. In regression tasks, the model accurately reconstructs\\nthe loss parameter sequences, and in forecasting, it predicts future values,\\nwith improved performance as the memory parameter approaches 1 for Markovian\\nchannels. These results demonstrate the potential of neural networks in\\ncharacterizing and predicting the dynamics of quantum channels.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T10:15:47Z\"}"}
