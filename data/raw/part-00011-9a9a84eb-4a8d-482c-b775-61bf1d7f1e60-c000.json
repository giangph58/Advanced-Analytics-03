The\\nKlein-Gordon equation with generalized Coulomb potentials is analyzed in this\\nbackground. The effects of these topological defects on the equations of\\nmotion, phase shifts, and the S-matrix are examined in detail. Bound state\\nsolutions are derived from the poles of the S-matrix. We provide analytical\\nexpressions for the energy spectrum of bound states, with particular attention\\nto how the parameters of scalar and vector potentials affect the behavior of\\nthe system. Furthermore, we explore particular cases involving pure scalar,\\nvector, and mixed scalar-vector potentials, showing how these scenarios impose\\nparticular conditions on the existence of bound states. Our results indicate\\nthat the solutions obtained associated with scattering and bound states depend\\nsignificantly on the parameters of the topological defects.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T17:47:22Z\"}"}
