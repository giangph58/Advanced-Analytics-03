Our framework is validated through extensive exact numerical\\ncalculations and we use it to disentangle and understand the importance of\\ndimensionality and interaction range for the observation of glassy (i.e.,\\nsub-exponential) decay dynamics. Leveraging the deterministic control of qubit\\npositioning enabled by modern tweezer array architectures, we also introduce a\\nmethod (``J-mapping'') that can be used to emulate the relaxation dynamics of a\\ndisordered system with arbitrary dimensionality and interaction range in\\nbespoke one-dimensional arrays. Our approach paves the way towards tunable\\nrelaxation dynamics that can be explored in quantum simulators based on arrays\\nof neutral atoms and molecules.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas,cond-mat.dis-nn,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:29:33Z\"}"}
