{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06630v1\", \"title\": \"Two-Axis planar Hall magnetic field sensors with sub nanoTesla\\n  resolution\", \"summary\": \"Planar Hall effect (PHE) magnetic sensors are attractive for various\\napplications where the field resolution is required in the range of sub-nano\\nTesla or in Pico Tesla. Here we present a detailed noise study of the PHE\\nsensors consisting of two or three intersecting ellipses. It can be used to\\nmeasure two axes of the magnetic field in the sensor plane in particular along\\nthe two perpendicular easy axes in the overlapping region for two intersecting\\nellipses and three easy axes at an angle of 60 degrees for three crossing\\nellipses. Thus, for each remanent magnetic state in the overlap area, the\\nsensor can measure the vector component of the magnetic field perpendicular to\\nthe direction of the remanent magnetization. The two field components are\\nmeasured with a field resolution less than 200 pT/sqrt(Hz) at 10 Hz and 350\\npT/sqrt(Hz) at 1 Hz in the same region, while maintaining a similar size and\\nnoise level of a single-axis sensor. Furthermore, we discuss here the possible\\nroute for future improvement of the field resolution\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T07:07:27Z\"}"}
