{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21435v1\", \"title\": \"SeriesBench: A Benchmark for Narrative-Driven Drama Series Understanding\", \"summary\": \"With the rapid development of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), an\\nincreasing number of benchmarks have been established to evaluate the video\\nunderstanding capabilities of these models. However, these benchmarks focus on\\n\\\\textbf{standalone} videos and mainly assess ``visual elements'' like human\\nactions and object states. In reality, contemporary videos often encompass\\ncomplex and continuous narratives, typically presented as a \\\\textbf{series}. To\\naddress this challenge, we propose \\\\textbf{SeriesBench}, a benchmark consisting\\nof 105 carefully curated narrative-driven series, covering 28 specialized tasks\\nthat require deep narrative understanding. Specifically, we first select a\\ndiverse set of drama series spanning various genres. Then, we introduce a novel\\nlong-span narrative annotation method, combined with a full-information\\ntransformation approach to convert manual annotations into diverse task\\nformats. To further enhance model capacity for detailed analysis of plot\\nstructures and character relationships within series, we propose a novel\\nnarrative reasoning framework, \\\\textbf{PC-DCoT}. Extensive results on\\n\\\\textbf{SeriesBench} indicate that existing MLLMs still face significant\\nchallenges in understanding narrative-driven series, while \\\\textbf{PC-DCoT}\\nenables these MLLMs to achieve performance improvements. Overall, our\\n\\\\textbf{SeriesBench} and \\\\textbf{PC-DCoT} highlight the critical necessity of\\nadvancing model capabilities to understand narrative-driven series, guiding the\\nfuture development of MLLMs. SeriesBench is publicly available at\\nhttps://github.com/zackhxn/SeriesBench-CVPR2025.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI,cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T08:48:21Z\"}"}
