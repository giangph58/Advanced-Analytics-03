Beyond\\naddressing scalability in high-dimensional implementations, controller\\nsynthesis methodologies separating safety and reachability objectives may risk\\noptimization infeasibility due to conflicting constraints, thereby\\nsignificantly undermining their applicability in practical applications. In\\nthis paper, by leveraging feedback linearization and backstepping techniques,\\nwe present a novel framework for constructing provable reach-avoid formal\\ncertificates tailored to multi-input multi-output systems. Based on this, we\\ndeveloped a systematic synthesis approach for controllers with reach-avoid\\nguarantees, which ensures that the outputs of the system eventually enter the\\npredefined target set while staying within the required safe set. Finally, we\\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method through simulations.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:10:29Z\"}"}
