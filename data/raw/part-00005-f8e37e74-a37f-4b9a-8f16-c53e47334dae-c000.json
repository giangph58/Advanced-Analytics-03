First, we introduce a histogram reweighting scheme applicable to\\nQUBO-based sampling constrained to specific intervals of an order parameter,\\ne.g., physical energy. Next, we demonstrate that the scheme can accurately\\nrecover the density of states, which in turn allows for calculating expectation\\nvalues in the conjugate ensemble, e.g., at a fixed temperature. The method can\\nthus be used to advance the state-of-the-art characterization of physical\\nsystems that admit a QUBO-based representation and that are otherwise\\nintractable with real-space sampling methods. A case in point are space-filling\\nmelts of lattice ring polymers, recently mapped in QUBO form, for which our\\nmethod reveals that the ring catenation probability is non-monotonic with the\\nbending rigidity.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T17:59:32Z\"}"}
