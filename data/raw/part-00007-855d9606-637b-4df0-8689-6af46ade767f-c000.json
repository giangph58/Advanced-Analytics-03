{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05143v1\", \"title\": \"Taming Double-Spending in Offline Payments with Reputation-Weighted Loan\\n  Networks\", \"summary\": \"Blockchain solutions typically assume a synchronous network to ensure\\nconsistency and achieve consensus. In contrast, offline transaction systems aim\\nto enable users to agree on and execute transactions without assuming bounded\\ncommunication delays when interacting with the blockchain. Most existing\\noffline payment schemes depend on trusted hardware wallets that are assumed to\\nbe secure and tamper-proof. While this work introduces Overdraft, a novel\\noffline payment system that shifts the reliance from hardware to users\\nthemselves. Overdraft allows potential payment receivers to assess the\\nlikelihood of being paid, allowing them to accept transactions with confidence\\nor deny them. Overdraft achieves this by maintaining a loan network that is\\nweighted by online reputation. This loan network contains time-limited\\nagreements where users pledge to cover another user's payment if necessary. For\\nexample, when a payer lacks sufficient funds at the moment of commitment.\\nOffline users rely on the last known view of the loan network -- which they had\\naccess to when last online -- to determine whether to participate in an offline\\ntransaction. This view is used to estimate the probability of eventual payment,\\npossibly using multiple loans. Once online again, users commit their\\ntransactions to the blockchain with any conflicts being resolved\\ndeterministically. Overdraft incorporates incentives for users and is designed\\nto be resilient against Sybil attacks. As a proof of concept, we implemented\\nOverdraft as an Ethereum Solidity smart contract and deployed it on the Sepolia\\ntestnet to evaluate its performance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:48:19Z\"}"}
