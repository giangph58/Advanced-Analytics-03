{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23870v1\", \"title\": \"A SAT-centered XAI method for Deep Learning based Video Understanding\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces a novel formal SAT-based explanation model for deep\\nlearning in video understanding. The proposed method integrates SAT solving\\ntechniques with the principles of formal explainable AI to address the\\nlimitations of existing XAI techniques in this domain. By encoding deep\\nlearning models and video data into a logical framework and formulating\\nexplanation queries as satisfiability problems, the method aims to generate\\nlogic-based explanations with formal guarantees. The paper details the\\nconceptual framework, the process of encoding deep learning models and video\\ndata, the formulation of \\\"Why?\\\" and \\\"Why not?\\\" questions, and a novel\\narchitecture integrating a SAT solver with a deep learning video understanding\\nmodel. While challenges related to computational complexity and the\\nrepresentational power of propositional logic remain, the proposed approach\\noffers a promising direction for enhancing the explainability of deep learning\\nin the complex and critical domain of video understanding.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LO\", \"categories\": \"cs.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T09:20:06Z\"}"}
