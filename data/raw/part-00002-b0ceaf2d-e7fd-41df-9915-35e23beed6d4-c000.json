First\\n  millimetre spectral imaging with Concerto\", \"summary\": \"The millimetre spectrum of Galactic regions and galaxies is rich in continuum\\nand molecular lines. That diversity is mostly tackled by either broad-band\\nphotometry or high resolution heterodyne spectroscopy. We aim to map the\\nmillimetre continuum emission of Galactic regions with a spectral resolution\\nintermediate between broad-band photometry and heterodyne spectroscopy,\\nenabling us to quickly cover large sky areas with spectroscopy. We report\\nobservations of the Orion Nebula with the CONCERTO instrument, which was\\ninstalled at the APEX telescope focal plane from April 2021 to December 2023.\\nWe find that the spectrum of Orion is dominated by dust emission with an\\nemissivity index from 1.3 to 2.0 along with the strong CO(2-1) and H$_2$O lines\\nwhich are naturally separated from the continuum, thanks to CONCERTO spectral\\ncapabilities. Many regions show a strong free-free emission as well, at lower\\nfrequencies. We demonstrate the spectral capabilities of CONCERTO at\\nintermediate spectral resolution, with a frequency coverage from 130 to 310\\nGHz. A sensitivity of 200 mK is achieved in one second, for one beam and a 6\\nGHz frequency width, over an 18 arcmin diameter field-of-view, which is within\\na factor 3 of the expectations. We show that we can spectrally disentangle the\\ncontinuum from the CO line emission. The slope of the millimetre continuum is\\nline-free mapped for the first time in Orion.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T07:25:42Z\"}"}
