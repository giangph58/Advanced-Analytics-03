We use the Fisher-bias\\nformalism, recently adapted to examine perturbed recombination solutions to the\\nHubble tension, and extend its range of validity with an iterative method. We\\nfirst analyze the Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data,\\ndemonstrating the existence of modifications to the primordial power spectrum\\ncapable of fully resolving the tension between Planck and SH0ES. As a proof of\\nconcept, we interpret these solutions in terms of small, time-dependent\\nvariations in the first slow roll parameter or in the sound speed of curvature\\nperturbations during a stage of primordial inflation. However, these solutions\\nare associated with a low total matter density $\\\\Omega_m$, which makes them\\ninconsistent with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and uncalibrated\\nsupernovae (SNIa) data. When incorporating additional BOSS and PantheonPlus\\ndata, the solutions that reduce the Hubble tension tend to overfit Planck CMB\\ndata to compensate for the worsened fit to BAO and SNIa data, making them less\\ncompelling. These findings suggest that modifying the primordial power spectrum\\nalone is unlikely to provide a robust resolution to the tension and highlight\\nhow the viability of such data-driven solutions depends on the specific\\ndatasets considered, emphasizing the role of future high-precision observations\\nin further constraining possible resolutions to the tension.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:59:59Z\"}"}
