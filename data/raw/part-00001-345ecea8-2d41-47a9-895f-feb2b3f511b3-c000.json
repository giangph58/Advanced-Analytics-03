{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24292v1\", \"title\": \"Implicit Electric Field Conjugation with the Photonic Lantern Nuller\", \"summary\": \"The Photonic Lantern Nuller (PLN) is an instrument concept designed to\\ncharacterize exoplanets within a single beam-width from its host star. The PLN\\nleverages the spatial symmetry of a mode-selective photonic lantern (MSPL) to\\ncreate nulled ports, which cancel out on-axis starlight but allow off-axis\\nexoplanet light to couple. The null-depths are limited by wavefront aberrations\\nin the system as well as by imperfections in the lantern. We show that the\\nimplicit electric field conjugation algorithm can be used to reduce the stellar\\ncoupling through the PLN by orders of magnitude while maintaining the majority\\nof the off-axis light, leading to deeper null depths (~10^{-4}) and thus higher\\nsensitivity to potential planet signals. We discuss a theory for the tradeoff\\nwe observed between the different ports, where iEFC improves the nulls of some\\nports at the expense of others, and show that targeting one port alone can lead\\nto deeper starlight rejection through that port than when targeting all ports\\nat once. We also observe different levels of stability depending on the port\\nand discuss the implications for practically implementing this technique for\\nscience observations.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:38:18Z\"}"}
