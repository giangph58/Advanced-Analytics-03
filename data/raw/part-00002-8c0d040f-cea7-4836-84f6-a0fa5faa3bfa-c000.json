We employ analytical\\ncontinuation to compute the timelike entanglement entropy for a pure timelike\\ninterval in such CFTs. We find that, unlike the real part, the imaginary part\\nof the TEE displays an asymmetric dependence on the central charges of the left\\nand right moving modes. We propose that the asymmetric dependence on central\\ncharges of the imaginary part of the TEE can be used to probe the presence of\\ngravitational anomalies in chiral CFT. Furthermore, we propose a holographic\\nconstruction to obtain the timelike entanglement entropy from the bulk dual\\ngeometries involving topologically massive gravity in AdS$_3$. The holographic\\nresults obtained matches exactly with the dual field theory results.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T11:44:29Z\"}"}
