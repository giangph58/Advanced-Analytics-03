{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10952v1\", \"title\": \"A Signal Matrix-Based Local Flaw Detection Framework for Steel Wire\\n  Ropes Using Convolutional Neural Networks\", \"summary\": \"Steel wire ropes (SWRs) are critical load-bearing components in industrial\\napplications, yet their structural integrity is often compromised by local\\nflaws (LFs). Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL) is a widely used non-destructive\\ntesting method that detects defects by measuring perturbations in magnetic\\nfields. Traditional MFL detection methods suffer from critical limitations:\\none-dimensional approaches fail to capture spatial relationships across sensor\\nchannels, while multi-dimensional image-based techniques introduce\\ninterpolation artifacts and computational inefficiencies. This paper proposes a\\nnovel detection framework based on signal matrices, directly processing raw\\nmulti-channel MFL signals using a specialized Convolutional Neural Network for\\nsignal matrix as input (SM-CNN). The architecture incorporates stripe pooling\\nto preserve channel-wise features and symmetric padding to improve boundary\\ndefect detection. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance with 98.74%\\naccuracy and 97.85% recall. Additionally, it demonstrates exceptional\\ncomputational efficiency, processing at 87.72 frames per second (FPS) with a\\nlow inference latency of 2.6ms and preprocessing time of 8.8ms. With only 1.48\\nmillion parameters, this lightweight design supports real-time processing,\\nestablishing a new benchmark for SWR inspection in industrial settings.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T07:59:04Z\"}"}
