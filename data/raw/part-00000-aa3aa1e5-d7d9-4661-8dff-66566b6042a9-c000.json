A key\\nquestion is the influence of chemical disorder, which is ubiquitous but\\nexceedingly difficult to model. Using resonant x-ray scattering, we identified\\ntwo-dimensional charge order in stoichiometric YBa$_2$Cu$_4$O$_8$ ($T_c$ = 80\\nK), which is nearly free of chemical disorder. The charge order amplitude shows\\na concave temperature dependence and vanishes sharply at $T^*$ = 200 K, the\\nonset of a prominent pseudogap previously determined by spectroscopy,\\nsuggesting a causal link between these phenomena. The gradual onset of charge\\norder in other cuprates is thus likely attributable to an inhomogeneous\\ndistribution of charge ordering temperatures due to disorder induced by\\nchemical substitution. The relationship between the pseudogap and the\\ndisorder-induced gradual freeze-out of charge carriers remains a central issue\\nin research on high-$T_c$ superconductors.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T13:39:15Z\"}"}
