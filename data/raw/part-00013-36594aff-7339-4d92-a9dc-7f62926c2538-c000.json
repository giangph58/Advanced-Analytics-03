{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00657v1\", \"title\": \"Joint inference for gravitational wave signals and glitches using a\\n  data-informed glitch model\", \"summary\": \"Gravitational wave data are often contaminated by non-Gaussian noise\\ntransients, glitches, which can bias the inference of astrophysical signal\\nparameters. Traditional approaches either subtract glitches in a pre-processing\\nstep, or a glitch model can be included from an agnostic wavelet basis (e.g.\\nBayesWave). In this work, we introduce a machine-learning-based approach to\\nbuild a parameterised model of glitches. We train a normalising flow on known\\nglitches from the Gravity Spy catalogue, constructing an informative prior on\\nthe glitch model. By incorporating this model into the Bayesian inference\\nanalysis with Bilby, we estimate glitch and signal parameters simultaneously.\\nWe demonstrate the performance of our method through bias reduction, glitch\\nidentification and Bayesian model selection on real glitches. Our results show\\nthat this approach effectively removes glitches from the data, significantly\\nimproving source parameter estimation and reducing bias.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T16:59:36Z\"}"}
