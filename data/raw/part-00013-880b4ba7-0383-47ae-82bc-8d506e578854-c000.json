{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06813v1\", \"title\": \"Introducing the Arm-membench Throughput Benchmark\", \"summary\": \"Application performance of modern day processors is often limited by the\\nmemory subsystem rather than actual compute capabilities. Therefore, data\\nthroughput specifications play a key role in modeling application performance\\nand determining possible bottlenecks. However, while peak instruction\\nthroughputs and bandwidths for local caches are often documented, the\\nachievable throughput can also depend on the relation between memory access and\\ncompute instructions. In this paper, we present an Arm version of the well\\nestablished x86-membench throughput benchmark, which we have adapted to support\\nall current SIMD extensions of the Armv8 instruction set architecture. We\\ndescribe aspects of the Armv8 ISA that need to be considered in the portable\\ndesign of this benchmark. We use the benchmark to analyze the memory subsystem\\nat a fine spatial granularity and to unveil microarchitectural details of three\\nprocessors: Fujitsu A64FX, Ampere Altra and Cavium ThunderX2. Based on the\\nresulting performance information, we show that instruction fetch and decoder\\nwidths become a potential bottleneck for cache-bandwidth-sensitive workloads\\ndue to the load-store concept of the Arm ISA.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AR\", \"categories\": \"cs.AR,cs.PF\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T12:07:26Z\"}"}
