We analyze the friction kernel, revealing power-law tails in the weak\\ncoupling limit and exponential decay in the strong coupling regime. Due to the\\ninterplay between bath interactions, probe-bath coupling, and activity, the\\nmean squared displacement, velocity, and stationary velocity correlations\\nexhibit different dynamical regimes, which we characterize analytically. Under\\nharmonic confinement, we find that energy equipartition holds at low activity\\nbut breaks down at higher activity, with the kinetic energy exhibiting a\\nnon-monotonic dependence on the activity of the bath.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech,cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T17:27:41Z\"}"}
