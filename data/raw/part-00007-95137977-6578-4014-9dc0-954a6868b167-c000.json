However,\\nit is essential to recognize that while AI models have introduced remarkable\\nadvancements, they also present inherent challenges such as their vulnerability\\nto adversarial attacks. The current work proposes a novel defense mechanism\\nagainst one of the most significant attack vectors of AI models - the backdoor\\nattack via data poisoning of training datasets. In this defense technique, an\\nintegrated approach that combines chaos theory with manifold learning is\\nproposed. A novel metric - Precision Matrix Dependency Score (PDS) that is\\nbased on the conditional variance of Neurochaos features is formulated. The PDS\\nmetric has been successfully evaluated to distinguish poisoned samples from\\nnon-poisoned samples across diverse datasets.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T05:51:27Z\"}"}
