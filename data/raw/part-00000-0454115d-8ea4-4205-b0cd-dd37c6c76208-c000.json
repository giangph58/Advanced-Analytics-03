The use of\\nmulti-biometric systems combining multiple biometric modalities is usually\\nrecommended for high-security applications. However, the presentation of\\nmultiple biometric modalities can impair the user-friendliness of the overall\\nsystem and might not be necessary in all cases. In this work, we present a\\nsimple but flexible approach to increase the privacy protection of\\nhomomorphically encrypted multi-biometric reference templates while enabling\\nadaptation to security requirements at run-time: An adaptive multi-biometric\\nfusion with fully homomorphic encryption (AMB-FHE). AMB-FHE is benchmarked\\nagainst a bimodal biometric database consisting of the CASIA iris and MCYT\\nfingerprint datasets using deep neural networks for feature extraction. Our\\ncontribution is easy to implement and increases the flexibility of biometric\\nauthentication while offering increased privacy protection through joint\\nencryption of templates from multiple modalities.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T11:00:08Z\"}"}
