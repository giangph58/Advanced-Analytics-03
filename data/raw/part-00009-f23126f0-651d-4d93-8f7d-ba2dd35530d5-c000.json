The current battery electric\\ntruck technology poses several challenges to the operations of commercial\\nvehicles, such as limited driving range, sensitivity to climate conditions, and\\nlong recharging times. Estimating the energy consumption of heavy-duty electric\\ntrucks is crucial to assess the feasibility of the fleet electrification and\\nits impact on the electric grid. This paper focuses on developing a model-based\\nsimulation approach to predict and analyze the energy consumption of drayage\\ntrucks used in ports logistic operations, considering seasonal climate\\nvariations and geographical characteristics. The paper includes results for\\nthree major container ports within the United States, providing region-specific\\ninsights into driving range, payload capacity, and charging infrastructure\\nrequirements, which will inform decision-makers in integrating electric trucks\\ninto the existing drayage operations and plan investments for electric grid\\ndevelopment.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T13:39:21Z\"}"}
