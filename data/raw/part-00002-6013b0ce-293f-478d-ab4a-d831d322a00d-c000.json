We apply mmfX2C-DIP-EOMCC to several neutral\\natoms and diatomic molecules to obtain the ground and first few excited states\\nof the corresponding di-cation species, and we observe excellent agreement (to\\nwithin 0.001 eV) between double ionization potentials (IPs) obtained from\\nmmfX2C- and four-component DIP-EOMCC calculations that include\\n3-hole--1-particle ($3h1p$) excitations, with either the Dirac--Coulomb or\\nDirac--Coulomb--Gaunt Hamiltonians. We also compare double IPs for\\nmmfX2C-DIP-EOMCC calculations with the full Dirac--Coulomb--Breit (DCB)\\nHamiltonian to those from experiment. The mmfX2C-DIP-EOMCC with $3h1p$\\nexcitations leads to errors in absolute double IPs that are larger than 0.1 eV,\\nwhereas the addition of $4h2p$ excitations reduces these errors dramatically,\\noften by an order of magnitude or more.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T12:59:09Z\"}"}
