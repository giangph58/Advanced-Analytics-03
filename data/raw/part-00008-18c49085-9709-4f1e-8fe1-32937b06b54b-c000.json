We created and utilized a\\ndataset to perform a comparative analysis of search results generated by\\nleading AI-based solutions, LinkedIn Recruiter, and our proprietary system,\\nPearch.ai. Human experts assessed the relevance of the returned candidates, and\\nan Elo rating system was applied to quantitatively measure each tool's\\ncomparative performance. Our findings indicate that AI-driven recruitment\\nsourcing tools consistently outperform LinkedIn Recruiter in candidate\\nrelevance, with Pearch.ai achieving the highest performance scores.\\nFurthermore, we found a strong alignment between AI-based evaluations and human\\njudgments, highlighting the potential for advanced AI technologies to\\nsubstantially enhance talent acquisition effectiveness.
