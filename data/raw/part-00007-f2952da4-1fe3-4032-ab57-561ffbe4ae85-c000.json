We show that holographically recorded gratings in\\nnanodiamond-polymer composites (nDPC) form ideal diffraction elements for very\\ncold neutrons. Their advantage of high diffraction efficiency, combined with\\nlow angular selectivity as a two-port beam splitter, meets the necessary\\nconditions for application in a very cold neutron interferometer. We provide an\\noverview of the latest achievements in the construction of such a triple Laue\\ninterferometer. A first operational test of the interferometer is planned\\nimmediately after this conference in May 2025.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T11:26:03Z\"}"}
