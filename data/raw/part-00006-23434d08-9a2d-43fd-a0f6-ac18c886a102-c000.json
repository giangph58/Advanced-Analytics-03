{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07862v1\", \"title\": \"Resummation of Universal Tails in Gravitational Waveforms\", \"summary\": \"We present a formula for the universal anomalous scaling of the multipole\\nmoments of a generic gravitating source in classical general relativity. We\\nderive this formula in two independent ways using effective field theory\\nmethods. First, we use the absorption of low frequency gravitational waves by a\\nblack hole to identify the total multipole scaling dimension as the\\nrenormalized angular momentum of black hole perturbation theory. More\\ngenerally, we show that the anomalous dimension is determined by phase shifts\\nof gravitational waves elastically scattering off generic source multipole\\nmoments, which reproduces the renormalized angular momentum in the particular\\ncase of black holes. The effective field theory approach thus clarifies the\\nrole of the renormalized angular momentum in the multipole expansion. The\\nuniversality of the point-particle effective description of compact gravitating\\nsystems further allows us to extract the universal part of the anomalous\\ndimension, which is the same for any object, including black holes, neutron\\nstars, and binary systems. As an application, we propose a novel resummation of\\nthe universal short-distance logarithms (``tails'') in the gravitational\\nwaveform of binary systems, which may improve the modeling of signals from\\ncurrent and future gravitational wave experiments.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,astro-ph.HE,gr-qc,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:39:05Z\"}"}
