We utilize recent advancements in 3D reconstruction based on Gaussian\\nSplatting for 3D object placement in driving scenes. Unlike existing\\ndiffusion-based methods that synthesize images conditioned on BEV layouts, our\\napproach places 3D objects directly in the reconstructed 3D space with\\nexplicitly imposed geometric transformations. This ensures both the physical\\nplausibility of object placement and highly accurate 3D pose and position\\nannotations.\\n  Our experiments demonstrate that even by integrating a limited number of\\nexternal 3D objects into real scenes, the augmented data significantly enhances\\n3D object detection performance and outperforms existing diffusion-based 3D\\naugmentation for object detection. Extensive testing on the nuScenes dataset\\nreveals that imposing high geometric diversity in object placement has a\\ngreater impact compared to the appearance diversity of objects. Additionally,\\nwe show that generating hard examples, either by maximizing detection loss or\\nimposing high visual occlusion in camera images, does not lead to more\\nefficient 3D data augmentation for camera-based 3D object detection in\\nautonomous driving.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T14:10:36Z\"}"}
