However, its deployment is\\nchallenged by link blockages that cause connectivity outages. Optical\\nreconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ORISs) have recently emerged as a solution\\nto mitigate these disruptions. This work considers a multi-user VLC system and\\ninvestigates the optimal association of ORISs to LEDs and users to minimize the\\noutage probability while limiting the number of ORISs used. Numerical results\\nfrom our proposed optimization algorithm demonstrate that using ORISs can\\nreduce the outage probability by up to 85% compared to a no-ORIS scenario.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T15:24:25Z\"}"}
