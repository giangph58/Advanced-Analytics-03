This study\\nexplores the impact of magnetic flux on thermoelectric transport, emphasizing\\nthe role of quantum interference induced by the flux. When the magnetic flux is\\nvaried from 0 to one quantum of flux $\\\\Phi = \\\\Phi_{0} = \\\\frac{h}{e}$, both the\\nelectrical conductance and the thermoelectric figure of merit ($ZT$)\\nsignificantly increase by two order of magnitude. Moreover, our investigation\\ninto the effects of onsite and inter-site Coulomb interactions in this\\nnanojunction indicates that an optimal $ZT$ is attained with moderate onsite\\nCoulomb interaction and minimal inter-site Coulomb interaction. We briefly\\ndiscussed the effects of asymmetric arrangements of triple QDs within an AB\\nring. However, within our parameter regime, a symmetric arrangement offers\\nsuperior thermoelectric performance compared to asymmetric configurations.\\nFurthermore, we explored how increasing the number of QDs in the ring enhances\\nthe thermoelectric properties, resulting in a potential $ZT$ value of around\\n$0.43$. This study shows that arranging multiple QDs symmetrically in an AB\\nring can result in significant thermoelectric performance in nanostructured\\nsystem at low temperatures.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T11:52:42Z\"}"}
