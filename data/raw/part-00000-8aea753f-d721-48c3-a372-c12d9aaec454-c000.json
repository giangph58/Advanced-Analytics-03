Despite its\\nsimple formulation, this problem turns out to be remarkably difficult. We\\nperform a systematic evaluation by considering three solution encodings and\\nfour problem instances, analyzing how well different types of evolutionary\\nalgorithms behave in finding a maximally nonlinear Boolean function. Our\\nresults show that genetic programming generally outperforms other evolutionary\\nalgorithms, although it falls short of the best-known results achieved by\\nad-hoc heuristics. Interestingly, by adding local search and restricting the\\nspace to rotation symmetric Boolean functions, we show that a genetic algorithm\\nwith the bitstring encoding manages to evolve a $9$-variable Boolean function\\nwith nonlinearity 241.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NE\", \"categories\": \"cs.NE,cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:35:53Z\"}"}
