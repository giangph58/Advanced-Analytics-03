This paper proposes SuoiAI, an end-to-end\\npipeline for building a dataset of aquatic invertebrates in Vietnam and\\nemploying machine learning (ML) techniques for species classification. We\\noutline the methods for data collection, annotation, and model training,\\nfocusing on reducing annotation effort through semi-supervised learning and\\nleveraging state-of-the-art object detection and classification models. Our\\napproach aims to overcome challenges such as data scarcity, fine-grained\\nclassification, and deployment in diverse environmental conditions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T17:33:02Z\"}"}
