However, the limited availability of detailed\\necological data, especially for complex ecological interactions creates\\nuncertainty in model predictions, often requiring adjustments to the\\nmathematical formulation of these interactions. Modifying the mathematical\\nrepresentation of components responsible for complex behaviors, such as\\npredation, can further contribute to this uncertainty, a phenomenon known as\\nstructural sensitivity. Structural sensitivity has been explored primarily in\\nnon-spatial systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and in\\na limited number of simple, spatially extended systems modeled by\\nnonhomogeneous parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), where\\nself-diffusion alone cannot produce spatial patterns. In this study, we broaden\\nthe scope of structural sensitivity analysis to include spatio-temporal\\necological systems in which spatial patterns can emerge due to diffusive\\ninstability. Through a combination of analytical techniques and supporting\\nnumerical simulations, we show that pattern formation can be highly sensitive\\nto how the system and its associated ecological interactions are mathematically\\nparameterized. In fact, some patterns observed in one version of the model may\\ncompletely disappear in another with a different parameterization, even though\\nthe underlying properties remain unchanged.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.PS\", \"categories\": \"nlin.PS,math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T13:28:08Z\"}"}
