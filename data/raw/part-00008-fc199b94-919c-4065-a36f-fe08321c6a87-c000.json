Here, we propose a bipartite-graph framework for studying\\nquantum excitation transfer in bosonic networks by diagonalizing the\\nintermediate sub-network between the sender and the receiver to construct a\\nbipartite-graph configuration. We examine the statistical properties of the\\nbosonic networks in both the original and bipartite-graph representations. In\\nparticular, we investigate quantum excitation transfer in both the finite and\\ninfinite intermediate-normal-mode cases, and show the dependence of the\\ntransfer efficiency on the network configurations and system parameters. We\\nfind the bound of maximally transferred excitations for various network\\nconfigurations and reveal the underlying physical mechanisms. We also find that\\nthe dark-mode effect will degrade the excitation transfer efficiency. Our\\nfindings provide a new insight for the design and optimization of quantum\\nnetworks.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T10:13:24Z\"}"}
