These photonic sensors\\nuse lasers to prepare and read out the atomic response to a radio frequency\\nelectromagnetic field. Most work on Rydberg atom sensors centers on radio\\nfrequency electric field strength because the sensor functions as a square law\\ndetector, unless an external radio frequency heterodyning field is used. A\\nheterodyning field acts as a local oscillator and enables phase read out at the\\nexpense of the radio frequency equipment necessary to generate it. In order to\\novercome the disadvantages of a radio frequency local oscillator, we\\ninvestigate all-optical phase-sensitive detection using a five-level\\nclosed-loop excitation scheme. We show that under finite detuning of the loop\\nfields, the atomic response oscillates at the frequency of the detuning. The\\noscillation is transferred to a probe laser absorption signal. The phase,\\nfrequency and amplitude of the radio frequency signal are imprinted on the\\noscillatory dynamics and can be determined using demodulation and matched\\nfilter techniques applied to the probe laser transmission signal.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T15:30:24Z\"}"}
