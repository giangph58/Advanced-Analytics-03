{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11939v1\", \"title\": \"Assessing WGC Compatibility in ModMax Black Holes via Photon Spheres\\n  Analysis and WCCC Validation\", \"summary\": \"It seems that the regime of Hawking radiation and evaporation ultimately\\ndrives charged black holes toward super-extremality of the charge parameter and\\nthe dominance of extremal conditions. This progression, in turn, lays the\\ngroundwork for satisfying the necessary conditions for the Weak Gravity\\nConjecture (WGC). Preliminary studies indicate that black holes such as the\\nReissner-Nordstr$\\\\\\\"o$m (RN) model, in their initial form, lack the capacity to\\nsustain super-extremality of the charge parameter. If such conditions arise,\\nthese black holes transition into naked singularities-a scenario that is highly\\nundesirable due to the loss of causality and the breakdown of space-time\\ngeometry. This raises whether the inability to sustain super-extremality is an\\ninherent property of the model or a consequence of the approximations and\\nprecision limitations employed in its construction. To address this, we turned\\nto the ModMax model, which represents an extension of the RN model. Our\\nanalysis revealed that the ModMax model not only accommodates super-extremality\\nof the charge parameter but also, under certain conditions, emerges as a\\npromising candidate for investigating the WGC. Furthermore, we independently\\nobserved how the inclusion of the de Sitter radius ($\\\\ell$) in the AdS model\\nand $f(R)$ gravitational corrections-both of which enhance and complicate the\\nmodel-can have a direct impact on the range of super-extremal charge tolerance\\nwhich, in turn, provides the realization of the conditions necessary for the\\nWGC.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T10:17:15Z\"}"}
