Investigations based on nonlinear Lagrangians, such as Euler-Heisenberg\\nand Born-Infeld, are instrumental in exploring the limits of classical and\\nquantum field theories, providing valuable insights into strong-field\\nphenomena. In this context, this work considers how light propagates in\\nstrong-field environments, where such nonlinearities play significant roles,\\noffering a way to investigate events in high-energy astrophysics, quantum\\noptics, and fundamental physics beyond classical Maxwell's framework. Here,\\nseveral aspects of light propagation in nonlinear electrodynamics are\\ndiscussed. Phase and group velocities are derived and several interesting\\nbehaviors are unveiled, such as birefringence, non-reciprocal propagation, and\\nasymmetries between phase and group velocities in special configurations.\\nSpecific solutions based on commonly studied nonlinear theories are also\\ninvestigated, and phenomena like slow-light and one-way propagation are\\ndiscussed.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.gen-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.gen-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:49:51Z\"}"}
