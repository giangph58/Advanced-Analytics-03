Under a mild restriction of the characteristic of the\\ncoefficient field, we prove a torsion vanishing result for Shimura varieties of\\nabelian type, confirming a conjecture by Hamann--Lee. Our proofs utilize the\\nunipotent categorical local Langlands correspondence and, in contrast to\\nprevious works, do not rely on the endoscopic classification of representations\\nor on other results established through trace formula techniques.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT,math.AG,math.RT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T11:25:03Z\"}"}
