They are isomorphic classes of finite discrete-time\\ndynamical systems. Endowed with the direct sum and product, functional digraphs\\nform a semiring with an interesting multiplicative structure. For instance, we\\ndo not know if the following division problem can be solved in polynomial time:\\ngiven two functional digraphs $A$ and $B$, does $A$ divide $B$? That $A$\\ndivides $B$ means that there exists a functional digraph $X$ such that $AX$ is\\nisomorphic to $B$, and many such $X$ can exist. We can thus ask for the number\\nof solutions $X$. In this paper, we focus on the case where $B$ is a sum of\\ncycles (a disjoint union of cycles, corresponding to the limit behavior of\\nfinite discrete-time dynamical systems). There is then a na\\\\\\\"ive\\nsub-exponential algorithm to compute the non-isomorphic solutions $X$, and our\\nmain result is an improvement of this algorithm which has the property to be\\npolynomial when $A$ is fixed. It uses a divide-and-conquer technique that\\nshould be useful for further developments on the division problem.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,cs.DM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T10:22:56Z\"}"}
