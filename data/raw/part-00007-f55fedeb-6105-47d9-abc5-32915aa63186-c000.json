Recent studies\\nsuggest that promoting \\\\{beta}-arrestin-biased signaling in NTSR1 may diminish\\ndrugs of abuse, such as psychostimulants, thereby offering a potential avenue\\nfor treating human addiction-related disorders. In this study, we utilized a\\nnovel computational and experimental approach that combined nudged elastic\\nband-based molecular dynamics simulations, Markov state models, temporal\\ncommunication network analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, and conformational\\nbiosensors, to explore the intricate mechanisms underlying NTSR1 activation and\\nbiased signaling. Our study reveals a dynamic stepwise transition mechanism and\\nactivated transmission network associated with NTSR1 activation. It also yields\\nvaluable insights into the complex interplay between the unique polar network,\\nnon-conserved ion locks, and aromatic clusters in NTSR1 signaling. Moreover, we\\nidentified a cryptic allosteric site located in the intracellular region of the\\nreceptor that exists in an intermediate state within the activation pathway.\\nCollectively, these findings contribute to a more profound understanding of\\nNTSR1 activation and biased signaling at the atomic level, thereby providing a\\npotential strategy for the development of NTSR1 allosteric modulators in the\\nrealm of G protein-coupled receptor biology, biophysics, and medicine.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.BM\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.BM,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:46:20Z\"}"}
