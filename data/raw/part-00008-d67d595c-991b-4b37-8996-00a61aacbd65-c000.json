In particular, we focus on problems\\ncommonly found in mathematical competitions, such as the International\\nMathematical Olympiad (IMO), where the task is to determine all solutions to\\nconstraints on an uninterpreted function. Although these problems require only\\nhigh-school-level mathematics, state-of-the-art SMT solvers often struggle with\\nthem.
