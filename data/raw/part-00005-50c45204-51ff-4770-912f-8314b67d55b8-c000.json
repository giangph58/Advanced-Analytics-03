Our system relies on prompting a selection of\\nLLMs with varying examples of intellectually annotated records and asking the\\nLLMs to similarly suggest keywords for new records. This few-shot prompting\\ntechnique is combined with a series of post-processing steps that map the\\ngenerated keywords to the target vocabulary, aggregate the resulting subject\\nterms to an ensemble vote and, finally, rank them as to their relevance to the\\nrecord. Our system is fourth in the quantitative ranking in the all-subjects\\ntrack, but achieves the best result in the qualitative ranking conducted by\\nsubject indexing experts.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI,cs.DL,I.2.7\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T12:47:09Z\"}"}
