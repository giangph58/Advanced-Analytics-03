The study includes deriving\\nthe model as a geodesic equation for a weak Riemannian metric, demonstrating\\nsmooth dependence on the initial data, and establishing global-in-time\\nexistence and uniqueness of solutions. We also prove that the Lamb parameter in\\nthe model has a stabilizing effect on the dynamics: if it is large enough, the\\nsectional curvature along the trade-wind current is positive, implying\\nconjugate points.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T13:45:40Z\"}"}
