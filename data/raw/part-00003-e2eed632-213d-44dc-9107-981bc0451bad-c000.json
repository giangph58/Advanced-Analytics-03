The feature space of\\norientation and position is naturally enhanced via its oriented prolongation,\\nyielding a 4-dimensional manifold endowed with a canonical Engel structure.\\nThis structure encodes position, orientation, signed curvature, and scale. We\\nassociate an open submanifold of the prolongation with the quasi-regular\\nrepresentation of the similitude group SIM (2), and find left-invariant\\ngenerators for the Engel structure. Finally, we use the generators of the Engel\\nstructure to characterize curvature-sensitive receptive profiles .\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.NC\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.NC,math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T16:44:25Z\"}"}
