{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00598v1\", \"title\": \"Fast and Low-Cost Genomic Foundation Models via Outlier Removal\", \"summary\": \"We propose the first unified adversarial attack benchmark for Genomic\\nFoundation Models (GFMs), named GERM. Unlike existing GFM benchmarks, GERM\\noffers the first comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess\\nthe vulnerability of GFMs to adversarial attacks. Methodologically, we evaluate\\nthe adversarial robustness of five state-of-the-art GFMs using four widely\\nadopted attack algorithms and three defense strategies. Importantly, our\\nbenchmark provides an accessible and comprehensive framework to analyze GFM\\nvulnerabilities with respect to model architecture, quantization schemes, and\\ntraining datasets. Empirically, transformer-based models exhibit greater\\nrobustness to adversarial perturbations compared to HyenaDNA, highlighting the\\nimpact of architectural design on vulnerability. Moreover, adversarial attacks\\nfrequently target biologically significant genomic regions, suggesting that\\nthese models effectively capture meaningful sequence features.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T15:31:09Z\"}"}
