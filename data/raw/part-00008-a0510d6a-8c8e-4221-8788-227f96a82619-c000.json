This paper\\nproposes OSML+, a new ML-based resource scheduling mechanism for co-located\\ncloud services. OSML+ intelligently schedules the cache and main memory\\nbandwidth resources at the memory hierarchy and the computing core resources\\nsimultaneously. OSML+ uses a multi-model collaborative learning approach during\\nits scheduling and thus can handle complicated cases, e.g., avoiding resource\\ncliffs, sharing resources among applications, enabling different scheduling\\npolicies for applications with different priorities, etc. OSML+ can converge\\nfaster using ML models than previous studies. Moreover, OSML+ can automatically\\nlearn on the fly and handle dynamically changing workloads accordingly. Using\\ntransfer learning technologies, we show our design can work well across various\\ncloud servers, including the latest off-the-shelf large-scale servers. Our\\nexperimental results show that OSML+ supports higher loads and meets QoS\\ntargets with lower overheads than previous studies.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC,cs.LG,cs.PF\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T11:09:43Z\"}"}
