While this phenomenon is\\nthoroughly understood in the context of finite-dimensional Hamiltonian systems,\\nmuch less is known in the context of Hamiltonian PDEs. In this work we provide\\nthe first dimension-independent backward error analysis for a Runge-Kutta-type\\nmethod, the midpoint rule, which shows the existence of a modified energy for\\nthis method when applied to nonlinear Schroedinger equations regardless of the\\nlevel of spatial discretisation. We use this to establish long-time stability\\nof the numerical flow for the midpoint rule.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,cs.NA,math.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:02:07Z\"}"}
