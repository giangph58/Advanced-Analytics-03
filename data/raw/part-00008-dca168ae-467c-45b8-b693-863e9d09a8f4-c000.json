Specifically, we improve the error term in the estimate for this\\ncounting function to $\\\\mathcal{O}\\\\big(X^{2/3+\\\\epsilon}\\\\big)$, which matches the\\nbest-known result, due to Bhargava, Taniguchi and Thorne, over $\\\\mathbb{Q}$.\\nFurthermore, we obtain estimates for the refined counting function, where one\\nspecifies the splitting behaviour of finitely many primes. Also in this case,\\nour error term matches what is known for number fields. However, in the\\nfunction field setting, the secondary term becomes more difficult to write down\\nexplicitly.\\n  Our proof uses geometry of numbers methods, which are especially effective\\nfor function fields. In particular, we obtain an exact formula for the number\\nof orbits of cubic forms with fixed absolute discriminant. Moreover, by\\nstudying the one-level density of a family of Artin $L$-functions associated to\\nthese cubic fields, we prove an unconditional lower bound on the error term in\\nthe estimate for the refined counting function. This generalises a conditional\\nresult over $\\\\mathbb{Q}$, due to Cho, Fiorilli, Lee and S\\\\\\\"odergren.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T15:09:28Z\"}"}
