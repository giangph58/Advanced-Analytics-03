{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04180v1\", \"title\": \"Towards Large-scale Generative Ranking\", \"summary\": \"Generative recommendation has recently emerged as a promising paradigm in\\ninformation retrieval. However, generative ranking systems are still\\nunderstudied, particularly with respect to their effectiveness and feasibility\\nin large-scale industrial settings. This paper investigates this topic at the\\nranking stage of Xiaohongshu's Explore Feed, a recommender system that serves\\nhundreds of millions of users. Specifically, we first examine how generative\\nranking outperforms current industrial recommenders. Through theoretical and\\nempirical analyses, we find that the primary improvement in effectiveness stems\\nfrom the generative architecture, rather than the training paradigm. To\\nfacilitate efficient deployment of generative ranking, we introduce RankGPT, a\\nnovel generative architecture for ranking. We validate the effectiveness and\\nefficiency of our solution through online A/B experiments. The results show\\nthat RankGPT achieves significant improvements in user satisfaction with nearly\\nequivalent computational resources compared to the existing production system.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T07:25:46Z\"}"}
