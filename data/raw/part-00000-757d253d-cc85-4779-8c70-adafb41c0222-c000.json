{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21741v1\", \"title\": \"Adiabatic quantum state preparation in integrable models\", \"summary\": \"We propose applying the adiabatic algorithm to prepare high-energy\\neigenstates of integrable models on a quantum computer. We first review the\\nstandard adiabatic algorithm to prepare ground states in each magnetization\\nsector of the prototypical XXZ Heisenberg chain. Based on the thermodynamic\\nBethe ansatz, we show that the algorithm circuit depth is polynomial in the\\nnumber of qubits $N$, outperforming previous methods explicitly relying on\\nintegrability. Next, we propose a protocol to prepare arbitrary eigenstates of\\nintegrable models that satisfy certain conditions. For a given target\\neigenstate, we construct a suitable parent Hamiltonian written in terms of a\\ncomplete set of local conserved quantities. We propose using such Hamiltonian\\nas an input for an adiabatic algorithm. After benchmarking this construction in\\nthe case of the non-interacting XY spin chain, where we can rigorously prove\\nits efficiency, we apply it to prepare arbitrary eigenstates of the\\nRichardson-Gaudin models. In this case, we provide numerical evidence that the\\ncircuit depth of our algorithm is polynomial in $N$ for all eigenstates,\\ndespite the models being interacting.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.stat-mech,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:51:20Z\"}"}
