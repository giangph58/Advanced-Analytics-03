In this\\nwork, we investigate how conversational UIs powered by LLMs drive these\\npsychological factors and psychological ownership, the sense of possession a\\nuser may come to feel towards an entity or object they may not legally own. We\\ndesigned four SAV UIs with varying levels of anthropomorphic characteristics\\nand psychological ownership triggers. Quantitative measures of psychological\\nownership, anthropomorphism, quality of service, disclosure tendency, sentiment\\nof SAV responses, and overall acceptance were collected after participants\\ninteracted with each SAV. Qualitative feedback was also gathered regarding the\\nexperience of psychological ownership during the interactions. The results\\nindicate that an SAV conversational UI designed to be more anthropomorphic and\\nto induce psychological ownership improved users' perceptions of the SAV's\\nhuman-like qualities and improved the sentiment of responses compared to a\\ncontrol condition. These findings provide practical guidance for designing\\nLLM-based conversational UIs that enhance user experience and adoption of SAVs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.AI,cs.ET\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T09:25:22Z\"}"}
