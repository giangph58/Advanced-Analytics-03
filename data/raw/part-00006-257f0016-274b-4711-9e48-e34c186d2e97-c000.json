To this end, we\\nintroduce a parametric approach and consider a piecewise deterministic Markov\\nprocess modeling both the evolution of the parameter, also called the trait,\\nand the age of infection of individuals over time. At each new infection, a new\\ntrait is randomly chosen for the infected individual according to a Markov\\nkernel, and their age is reset to zero. In the large population limit, we\\nderive a partial differential equation (PDE) that describes the density of\\ntraits and ages. The main goal is to study the conditions under which endemic\\nequilibria exist for the deterministic PDE model and to establish an endemicity\\nthreshold that depends on the model parameters. The local stability of these\\nequilibria is also analyzed. The endemicity threshold is computed for several\\nexamples, including models that incorporate a vaccination policy, and a local\\nstability result is obtained for a memory-free SIS-type model.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,q-bio.PE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T15:32:48Z\"}"}
