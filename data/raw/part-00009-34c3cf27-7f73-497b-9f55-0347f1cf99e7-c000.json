{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19798v1\", \"title\": \"Stainless steel in an electronically excited state\", \"summary\": \"Austenitic stainless steel\\n(Fe$_{0.5875}$Cr$_{0.25}$Mn$_{0.09}$Ni$_{0.07}$C$_{0.0025}$) is modeled with\\nthe XTANT-3 simulation toolkit to evaluate its properties in an electronically\\nexcited state produced by ultrafast laser irradiation. The model relies on\\ndensity-functional tight binding to obtain the electronic Hamiltonian,\\nproducing the electronic energy levels and wave functions. They are used to\\ncalculate the electron heat capacity, electron heat conductivity, and\\nelectron-phonon coupling parameter at the electronic temperatures up to 25,000\\nK. It is revealed that stainless steel nonthermally melts at sub-picosecond\\ntimescales at the deposited dose of ~1.4 eV/atom (the electronic temperature\\n$T_e \\\\sim 10,000$ K): the atomic lattice disorders due to modifications of the\\ninteratomic potential induced by the excitation of electrons, even without\\nelectron-phonon coupling (Born-Oppenheimer approximation). Including the\\nelectron-phonon coupling (non-Born-Oppenheimer simulation) lowers the damage\\nthreshold dose to ~0.45 eV/atom, triggering atomic disorder at picosecond\\ntimescales via thermal melting, predicated on the atomic heating by electrons.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T13:40:21Z\"}"}
