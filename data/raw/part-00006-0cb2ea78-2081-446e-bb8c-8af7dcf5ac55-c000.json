{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19482v1\", \"title\": \"Dynamic r-index: An Updatable Self-Index for Highly Repetitive Strings\", \"summary\": \"A self-index is a compressed data structure that supports locate\\nqueries-reporting all positions where a given pattern occurs in a string. While\\nmany self-indexes have been proposed, developing dynamically updatable ones\\nsupporting string insertions and deletions remains a challenge. The r-index\\n(Gagie et al., SODA'18) is a representative static self-index based on the\\nrun-length Burrows-Wheeler transform (RLBWT), designed for highly repetitive\\nstrings - those with many repeated substrings. We present the dynamic r-index,\\nan extension of the r-index that supports locate queries in $\\\\mathcal{O}((m +\\n\\\\occ) \\\\log n)$ time using $\\\\mathcal{O}(r)$ words, where $n$ is the length of\\nthe string $T$, $m$ is the pattern length, $\\\\occ$ is the number of occurrences,\\nand $r$ is the number of runs in the RLBWT of $T$. It supports string\\ninsertions and deletions in $\\\\mathcal{O}((m + L_{\\\\max}) \\\\log n)$ time, where\\n$L_{\\\\max}$ is the maximum value in the LCP array of $T$. The average running\\ntime is $\\\\mathcal{O}((m + L_{\\\\avg}) \\\\log n)$, where $L_{\\\\avg}$ is the average\\nLCP value. We experimentally evaluated the dynamic r-index on various highly\\nrepetitive strings and demonstrated its practicality.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T04:54:50Z\"}"}
