This enables provision for alternative methodology for poverty\\nmeasurement and analysis along with some new results that are difficult to\\nobtain in the existing framework. Several flexible quantile function models\\nthat can enrich the existing ones are proposed and their utility is\\ndemonstrated for real data.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T06:15:17Z\"}"}
