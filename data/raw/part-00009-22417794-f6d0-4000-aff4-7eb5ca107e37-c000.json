We find that the integration of\\ngate dielectrics and field plates greatly improves the breakdown field in these\\ndevices, with state-of-art average breakdown field of 5.3 MV/cm (breakdown\\nvoltage > 260 V) with an associated maximum current density of 342 mA/mm, and\\ncut-off frequency of 9.1 GHz. Furthermore, low trap-related impact was observed\\nfrom minimal gate and drain lag estimated from pulsed I-V characteristics. The\\nreported results provide the potential of UWBG AlGaN HEFTs for the next\\ngeneration high-power radio frequency applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T06:23:06Z\"}"}
