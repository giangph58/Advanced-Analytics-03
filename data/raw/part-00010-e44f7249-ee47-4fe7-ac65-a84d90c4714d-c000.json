Here, for the first time,\\nwe set up a computational protocol to assess the peak broadening induced for\\nboth core and valence levels by solid-state effects in four amorphous polymers\\nby using a combination of density functional theory, many-body perturbation\\ntheory, and classical polarizable embedding. We show that intrinsic local\\ninhomogeneities in the electrostatic environment induce a Gaussian broadening\\nof $0.2$-$0.7$~eV in the binding energies of both core and semi-valence\\nelectrons, corresponding to a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of\\n$0.5$-$1.7$~eV for the investigated systems. The induced broadening is larger\\nin acrylate- than in styrene- based polymers, revealing the crucial role of\\npolar groups in controlling the roughness of the electrostatic landscape in the\\nsolid matrix.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.soft,physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T09:07:00Z\"}"}
