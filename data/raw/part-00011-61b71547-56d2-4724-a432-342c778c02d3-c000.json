Few\\napproaches have attempted to tackle the problem of identifying speakers solely\\nfrom text, and the existing ones have primarily relied on traditional methods.\\nIn this work, we explore the use of fuzzy fingerprints from large pre-trained\\nmodels to improve text-based speaker identification. We integrate\\nspeaker-specific tokens and context-aware modeling, demonstrating that\\nconversational context significantly boosts accuracy, reaching 70.6% on the\\nFriends dataset and 67.7% on the Big Bang Theory dataset. Additionally, we show\\nthat fuzzy fingerprints can approximate full fine-tuning performance with fewer\\nhidden units, offering improved interpretability. Finally, we analyze ambiguous\\nutterances and propose a mechanism to detect speaker-agnostic lines. Our\\nfindings highlight key challenges and provide insights for future improvements\\nin text-based speaker identification.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI,cs.CE,cs.LG,cs.NE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T08:44:33Z\"}"}
