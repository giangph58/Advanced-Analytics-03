{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05965v1\", \"title\": \"Generalized Parameter Lifting: Finer Abstractions for Parametric Markov\\n  Chains\", \"summary\": \"Parametric Markov chains (pMCs) are Markov chains (MCs) with symbolic\\nprobabilities. A pMC encodes a family of MCs, where each member is obtained by\\nreplacing parameters with constants. The parameters allow encoding dependencies\\nbetween transitions, which sets pMCs apart from interval MCs. The verification\\nproblem for pMCs asks whether each MC in the corresponding family satisfies a\\ngiven temporal specification. The state-of-the-art approach for this problem is\\nparameter lifting (PL) -- an abstraction-refinement loop that abstracts the pMC\\nto a non-parametric model analyzed with standard probabilistic model checking\\ntechniques. This paper presents two key improvements to tackle the main\\nlimitations of PL. First, we introduce generalized parameter lifting (GPL) to\\nlift various restrictive assumptions made by PL. Second, we present a big-step\\ntransformation algorithm that reduces parameter dependencies in pMCs and,\\ntherefore, results in tighter approximations. Experiments show that GPL is\\nwidely applicable and that the big-step transformation accelerates pMC\\nverification by up to orders of magnitude.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LO\", \"categories\": \"cs.LO,cs.FL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:23:43Z\"}"}
