These moduli generate additional massless adjoint fields, obstructing\\nthe realization of negative beta functions necessary for asymptotic freedom\\nunless they are decoupled around string scale. A viable solution involves\\nutilizing rigid cycles, which eliminate these unwanted adjoint fields. In this\\nwork, we for the first time present a class of consistent three-family\\nsupersymmetric Pati-Salam models from rigid intersecting D6-branes on the\\nfactorizable $\\\\mathbb{T}^6/(\\\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\\\times \\\\mathbb{Z}_2^\\\\prime)$\\norientifold with discrete torsion. These models satisfy all the known\\nconsistency conditions, including $\\\\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry, K-theory\\nconstraints, tadpole cancellation, and recent swampland bounds on the maximal\\ngauge group rank. We provide detailed particle spectra, analyze their\\nphenomenological implications, and discuss the decoupling of exotic states\\nthrough strong dynamics in the hidden sector.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T16:06:35Z\"}"}
