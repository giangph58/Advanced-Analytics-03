{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01410v1\", \"title\": \"The Interstellar Medium\", \"summary\": \"The interstellar medium (ISM) is the material that fills the space between\\nthe stars in all galaxies; it is a multi-phase medium in pressure equilibrium,\\nwith densities and temperatures covering over 6 orders of magnitude. Although\\naccounting for only a small fraction of the mass of any given galaxy, it is a\\nvital component, since it holds the material responsible for galaxy growth\\nthrough star formation. Studying the ISM requires careful observations at all\\nwavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. This article describes the\\nmulti-phase nature of the ISM, and then puts it in the context of galaxy\\nevolution models, emphasising the importance of the cycling of baryons in and\\nout of galaxies. Within this framework, the ISM plays a central role: it\\nconnects the physical processes operating on very large physical- and\\ntime-scales which control the accretion of gas onto galaxies, and the small\\nscale processes that regulate star formation.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T06:52:57Z\"}"}
