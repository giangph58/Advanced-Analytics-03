{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23753v1\", \"title\": \"Reputation in public goods cooperation under double Q-learning protocol\", \"summary\": \"Understanding and resolving cooperation dilemmas are key challenges in\\nevolutionary game theory, which have revealed several mechanisms to address\\nthem. This paper investigates the comprehensive influence of multiple\\nreputation-related components on public cooperation. In particular, cooperative\\ninvestments in public goods game are not fixed but simultaneously depend on the\\nreputation of group organizers and the population's cooperation willingness,\\nhence indirectly impacting on the players' income. Additionally, individual\\npayoff can also be directly affected by their reputation via a weighted\\napproach which effectively evaluates the actual income of players. Unlike\\nconventional models, the reputation change of players is non-monotonic, but may\\ntransform abruptly due to specific actions. Importantly, a theoretically\\nsupported double Q-learning algorithm is introduced to avoid overestimation\\nbias inherent from the classical Q-learning algorithm. Our simulations reveal a\\nsignificantly improved cooperation level, that is explained by a detailed\\nQ-value analysis. We also observe the lack of massive cooperative clusters in\\nthe absence of network reciprocity. At the same time, as an intriguing\\nphenomenon, some actors maintain moderate reputation and are continuously\\nflipping between cooperation and defection. The robustness of our results are\\nvalidated by mean-field approximation.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T06:03:26Z\"}"}
