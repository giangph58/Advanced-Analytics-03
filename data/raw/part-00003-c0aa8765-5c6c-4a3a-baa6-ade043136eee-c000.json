These phenomena materialise over very large scales. It would be\\ncomputationally infeasible to track them over a regular mesh. Yet, since the\\nphenomena are localised, adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) can be used to\\nconstruct meshes with a higher resolution close to the regions of interest.\\nExaHyPE is a software engine created to solve wave problems using AMR, and we\\nuse it as baseline to construct our numerical relativity application called\\nExaGRyPE. To advance the mesh in time, we have to interpolate and restrict\\nalong resolution transitions in each and every time step. ExaHyPE's vanilla\\ncode version uses a d-linear tensor-product approach. In benchmarks of a\\nstationary black hole this performs slowly and leads to errors in conserved\\nquantities near AMR boundaries. We therefore introduce a set of higher-order\\ninterpolation schemes where the derivatives are calculated at each coarse grid\\ncell to approximate the enclosed fine cells. The resulting methods run faster\\nthan the tensor-product approach. Most importantly, when running the stationary\\nblack hole simulation using the higher order methods the errors near the AMR\\nboundaries are removed.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CE\", \"categories\": \"cs.CE,cs.MS,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T11:52:58Z\"}"}
