{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19529v1\", \"title\": \"Adversarial Shallow Watermarking\", \"summary\": \"Recent advances in digital watermarking make use of deep neural networks for\\nmessage embedding and extraction. They typically follow the ``encoder-noise\\nlayer-decoder''-based architecture. By deliberately establishing a\\ndifferentiable noise layer to simulate the distortion of the watermarked\\nsignal, they jointly train the deep encoder and decoder to fit the noise layer\\nto guarantee robustness. As a result, they are usually weak against unknown\\ndistortions that are not used in their training pipeline. In this paper, we\\npropose a novel watermarking framework to resist unknown distortions, namely\\nAdversarial Shallow Watermarking (ASW). ASW utilizes only a shallow decoder\\nthat is randomly parameterized and designed to be insensitive to distortions\\nfor watermarking extraction. During the watermark embedding, ASW freezes the\\nshallow decoder and adversarially optimizes a host image until its updated\\nversion (i.e., the watermarked image) stably triggers the shallow decoder to\\noutput the watermark message. During the watermark extraction, it accurately\\nrecovers the message from the watermarked image by leveraging the insensitive\\nnature of the shallow decoder against arbitrary distortions. Our ASW is\\ntraining-free, encoder-free, and noise layer-free. Experiments indicate that\\nthe watermarked images created by ASW have strong robustness against various\\nunknown distortions. Compared to the existing ``encoder-noise layer-decoder''\\napproaches, ASW achieves comparable results on known distortions and better\\nrobustness on unknown distortions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.MM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T07:12:20Z\"}"}
