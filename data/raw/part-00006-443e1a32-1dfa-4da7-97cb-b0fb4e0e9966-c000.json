While there is a nice\\ncharacterization of free graphic arrangements, many interesting questions\\nbeyond the free case remain open. This paper introduces an explicit set of\\ngenerators for the module of logarithmic derivations of a general graphic\\narrangement based on graph separators. We obtain new insights in the derivation\\ndegree sequence in the non-free case and give bounds on the highest degree in\\nthe sequence. Moreover, this can broadly be used for future research in this\\narea.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,math.AC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:27:07Z\"}"}
