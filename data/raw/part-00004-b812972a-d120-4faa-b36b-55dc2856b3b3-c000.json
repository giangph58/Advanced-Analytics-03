The corresponding data samples\\nhave integrated luminosities of 980 and 428 fb${}^{-1}$, respectively. To infer\\nthe flavor of the $D^0$ meson, we exploit the correlation between the flavor of\\nthe reconstructed decay and the electric charges of particles reconstructed in\\nthe rest of the $e^+e^-\\\\to c{\\\\overline c}$ event. This results in a sample\\nwhich is independent from any other previously used at Belle or Belle II. The\\nresult, $A_{CP}(D^0 \\\\to K^0_{\\\\rm S} K^0_{\\\\rm S}) = (1.3 \\\\pm 2.0 \\\\pm 0.2)\\\\%$,\\nwhere the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic, is\\nconsistent with previous determinations and with $CP$ symmetry.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T13:25:40Z\"}"}
