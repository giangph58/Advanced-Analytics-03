To address this, we\\npropose a model-based approach that incorporates a transmission model to\\naccount for water-induced occlusion. We apply our method to video captured\\nunder different sea conditions. We estimate mass and volume, and compare our\\nresults to a manual 2D measurements-based method.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T10:47:29Z\"}"}
