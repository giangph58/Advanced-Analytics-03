{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19693v1\", \"title\": \"Emerging Photon Jets in the Hadronic Calorimeter: A Novel Signature of\\n  Neutral Long-Lived Particles at the LHC\", \"summary\": \"We propose a novel collider signature for neutral long-lived particles\\n(LLPs): the emerging photon jet in the hadronic calorimeter (HCAL). This\\nsignature arises when a neutral LLP decays into photons within the HCAL,\\nproducing an electromagnetic shower without associated charged tracks or energy\\ndeposits in the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL). To demonstrate the\\nviability of this approach, we consider the fermiophobic Higgs boson $h_{\\\\rm\\nf}$ in the Type-I two-Higgs-doublet model as a representative scenario. In the\\nultralight regime ($m_{h_{\\\\rm f}} < 1$ GeV), $h_{\\\\rm f}$ decays exclusively\\ninto a photon pair via loop-induced processes, resulting in a suppressed width\\nand consequently a long lifetime. Focusing on the golden channel $pp \\\\to H^\\\\pm\\nh_{\\\\rm f} \\\\to W^\\\\pm h_{\\\\rm f} h_{\\\\rm f}$, we analyze the exotic final state in\\nwhich one $h_{\\\\rm f}$ decays in the ECAL and appears as a highly collimated\\nphoton jet (reconstructed as a single photon), while the other decays within\\nthe HCAL, producing an emerging photon jet. Through a detailed\\nsignal-to-background analysis incorporating realistic detector effects via fast\\nsimulation, we demonstrate that this signature achieves discovery-level\\nsensitivity at the HL-LHC across a broad region of parameter space consistent\\nwith theoretical and experimental constraints. While our study focuses on the\\nfermiophobic Higgs, the emerging photon jet in the HCAL constitutes a broadly\\napplicable and previously unexplored strategy for detecting neutral LLPs\\ndecaying into photons, opening a new avenue in LLP searches at colliders.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T11:42:06Z\"}"}
