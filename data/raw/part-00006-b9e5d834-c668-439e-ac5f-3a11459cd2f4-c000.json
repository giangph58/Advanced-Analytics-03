In the context of four-dimensional causal dynamical\\ntriangulation simulations we investigate this possibility by measuring\\ncurvature-curvature correlators of different gravitational operators. We find a\\nbehavior consistent with a massive state, independent of the operators\\nconsidered, over a certain distance window. While at most a hint, this is\\ntantalizing due to its possible implications for dark matter or (primordial)\\nblack holes. We also find indications that the phase of rapid expansion of the\\nobtained de Sitter universe impacts the mass, and relates to quantum\\nfluctuations of space-time.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-lat\", \"categories\": \"hep-lat,gr-qc,hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T10:23:06Z\"}"}
