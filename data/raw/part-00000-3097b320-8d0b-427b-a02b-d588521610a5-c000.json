This problem is analysed using the\\nBrinkman-Debye-Bueche equations with an axisymmetric shielding (or\\npermeability) tensor. Using the exact Green's functions for this model fluid\\nwithin a single-layer boundary element formulation, we numerically compute the\\nfriction tensor for a translating sphere subjected to stick boundary\\nconditions. Furthermore, we derive approximate analytical expressions for small\\nanisotropy using the Lorentz reciprocal theorem. By benchmarking this result\\nagainst the numerical solutions, we find that a linear approximation is valid\\nin a broad parameter regime. Our results are important for studying\\nself-diffusion in general anisotropic porous media, but can also be applied to\\nsmall tracers in nematic fluids composed of disk- or rod-like crowders.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T06:34:51Z\"}"}
