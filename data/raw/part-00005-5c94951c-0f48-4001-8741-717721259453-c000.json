{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00525v1\", \"title\": \"A Methodological and Structural Review of Parkinsons Disease Detection\\n  Across Diverse Data Modalities\", \"summary\": \"Parkinsons Disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that primarily\\naffects motor functions and can lead to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and\\ndementia in its advanced stages. With approximately 10 million people diagnosed\\nglobally 1 to 1.8 per 1,000 individuals, according to reports by the Japan\\nTimes and the Parkinson Foundation early and accurate diagnosis of PD is\\ncrucial for improving patient outcomes. While numerous studies have utilized\\nmachine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques for PD recognition,\\nexisting surveys are limited in scope, often focusing on single data modalities\\nand failing to capture the potential of multimodal approaches. To address these\\ngaps, this study presents a comprehensive review of PD recognition systems\\nacross diverse data modalities, including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),\\ngait-based pose analysis, gait sensory data, handwriting analysis, speech test\\ndata, Electroencephalography (EEG), and multimodal fusion techniques. Based on\\nover 347 articles from leading scientific databases, this review examines key\\naspects such as data collection methods, settings, feature representations, and\\nsystem performance, with a focus on recognition accuracy and robustness. This\\nsurvey aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for researchers, providing\\nactionable guidance for the development of next generation PD recognition\\nsystems. By leveraging diverse data modalities and cutting-edge machine\\nlearning paradigms, this work contributes to advancing the state of PD\\ndiagnostics and improving patient care through innovative, multimodal\\napproaches.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T13:47:45Z\"}"}
