{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00622v1\", \"title\": \"Neural Network Verification for Gliding Drone Control: A Case Study\", \"summary\": \"As machine learning is increasingly deployed in autonomous systems,\\nverification of neural network controllers is becoming an active research\\ndomain. Existing tools and annual verification competitions suggest that soon\\nthis technology will become effective for real-world applications. Our\\napplication comes from the emerging field of microflyers that are passively\\ntransported by the wind, which may have various uses in weather or pollution\\nmonitoring. Specifically, we investigate centimetre-scale bio-inspired gliding\\ndrones that resemble Alsomitra macrocarpa diaspores. In this paper, we propose\\na new case study on verifying Alsomitra-inspired drones with neural network\\ncontrollers, with the aim of adhering closely to a target trajectory. We show\\nthat our system differs substantially from existing VNN and ARCH competition\\nbenchmarks, and show that a combination of tools holds promise for verifying\\nsuch systems in the future, if certain shortcomings can be overcome. We propose\\na novel method for robust training of regression networks, and investigate\\nformalisations of this case study in Vehicle and CORA. Our verification results\\nsuggest that the investigated training methods do improve performance and\\nrobustness of neural network controllers in this application, but are limited\\nin scope and usefulness. This is due to systematic limitations of both Vehicle\\nand CORA, and the complexity of our system reducing the scale of reachability,\\nwhich we investigate in detail. If these limitations can be overcome, it will\\nenable engineers to develop safe and robust technologies that improve people's\\nlives and reduce our impact on the environment.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T16:03:38Z\"}"}
