{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20701v1\", \"title\": \"Static black hole horizons in cosmology\", \"summary\": \"Despite previous results that rule out the possibility of a static black hole\\nhorizon in cosmology we present a black hole metric that has a static horizon\\nwhilst mimicking the cosmological behavior at large scales away from the black\\nhole horizon. By a suitable choice of coordinates, we show that it is possible\\nto have a static black hole horizon in cosmology that does not suffer from\\nissues like singularities in curvature invariants at the horizon. The resulting\\nmetric is consistent with the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric for constant\\nHubble parameter. It should be noted that this metric does not lead to\\nisotropic pressure, i.e. $p_\\\\perp\\\\neq p_r$ for radial distances comparable to\\nSchwarzschild radius, but for large $r$ the stress tensor (assuming general\\nrelativity) tends to the cosmological value. Turning to a more realistic\\nframework, we study the cases of black hole$+$cosmological matter and black\\nhole$+$matter$+$cosmological constant where we assume the pressure component\\ntakes its cosmological value and show that although the resulting metric does\\nnot have a static horizon, the physical radius of the apparent horizon can tend\\nto a constant value for large cosmological time. This metric does not suffer\\nfrom issues like a singular horizon for asymptotically vanishing Hubble\\nparameter.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.CO,hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T12:32:50Z\"}"}
