While human\\ncommunication naturally demonstrates this principle, state-of-the-art language\\nmodels struggle to maintain reliable consistency across different scenarios.\\nThis paper examines the landscape of consistency research in AI language\\nsystems, exploring both formal consistency (including logical rule adherence)\\nand informal consistency (such as moral and factual coherence). We analyze\\ncurrent approaches to measure aspects of consistency, identify critical\\nresearch gaps in standardization of definitions, multilingual assessment, and\\nmethods to improve consistency. Our findings point to an urgent need for robust\\nbenchmarks to measure and interdisciplinary approaches to ensure consistency in\\nthe application of language models on domain-specific tasks while preserving\\nthe utility and adaptability.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T03:25:25Z\"}"}
