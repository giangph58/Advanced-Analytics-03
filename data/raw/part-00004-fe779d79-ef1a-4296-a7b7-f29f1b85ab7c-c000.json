The formation of such higher-order\\nexceptional points does not require coupling among the subsystems. We determine\\nexplicitly the order and the spectral response strength of this exceptional\\npoint. Moreover, we observe that the energy eigenstates that do not merge are\\nentangled. Finally, we demonstrate that general initial states disentangle\\nduring time evolution due to the presence of the higher-order exceptional point\\nof the composite system.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:07:42Z\"}"}
