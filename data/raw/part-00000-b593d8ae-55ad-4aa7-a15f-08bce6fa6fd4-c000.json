This interaction,\\nresponsible for the Primakoff effect, is central to detecting axion-like\\nparticles in astrophysical settings and terrestrial experiments like\\nhelioscopes and haloscopes. Accurately predicting the interaction rate requires\\naccounting for quantum corrections. Our work tackles this by employing\\nmagnetically enhanced fermion propagators derived using Schwinger's proper time\\nmethod and a systematic Lorentz decomposition using the Ritus basis. We\\nevaluate the triangle loop diagram exactly, avoiding approximations on field\\nstrength or particle kinematics.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:46:10Z\"}"}
