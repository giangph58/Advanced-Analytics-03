Our study provides valuable\\ninsights into the underlying physics of magnetic (or spin-) polaron formation\\nin a doped antiferromagnet (AFM). For example, we find how the suppression of\\nspectral weight outside the magnetic Brillouin zone -- a precursor of Fermi arc\\nformation -- disappears with increasing temperature, revealing\\nnearly-deconfined spinon excitations of the undoped AFM. The pristine setting\\nwe consider can be directly explored using quantum simulators. Our calculations\\ndemonstrate that coherent quasiparticle peaks associated with magnetic polarons\\ncan be observed up to temperatures $T>J$ above the spin-exchange $J$, routinely\\nobtained in such experiments. This paves the way for future studies of the fate\\nof magnetic polarons in the pseudogap phase.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T12:38:45Z\"}"}
