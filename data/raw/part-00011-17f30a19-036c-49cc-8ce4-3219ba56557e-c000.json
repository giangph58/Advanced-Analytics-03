The energy-momentum tensor contains the\\ncontribution of a current related to the flow and the metric tensor does an\\noff-diagonal component to balance with the flow momentum. The presence of the\\noff-diagonal component of the metric implies the radial motion of the reference\\nframe, which gives rise to a problem how the relativistic effect is included in\\nthermodynamic observables for such a general relativistic system. This problem\\nis solved by taking an instantaneously rest frame in which geometric\\nthermodynamic observables read as previously and giving them the special\\nrelativistic effect emerged from the inverse transformation to the original\\nframe pointwise. The solution of the thermodynamic observables in accord with\\nthe laws of thermodynamics and the theory of relativity is presented. Finally\\nthe relativistic structure equations for the equilibrium are derived, from\\nwhich the general relativistic Poisson equation as well as the heat conduction\\none are developed exactly.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.SR,hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T08:42:20Z\"}"}
