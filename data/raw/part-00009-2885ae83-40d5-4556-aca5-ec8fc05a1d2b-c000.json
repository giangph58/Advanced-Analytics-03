{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06760v1\", \"title\": \"Applications of Poisson cohomology to the inducibility problems and\\n  study of deformation maps\", \"summary\": \"This paper provides some applications of the Poisson cohomology groups\\nintroduced by Flato, Gerstenhaber and Voronov. Given an abelian extension of a\\nPoisson algebra by a representation, we first investigate the inducibility of a\\npair of Poisson algebra automorphisms and show that the corresponding\\nobstruction lies in the second Poisson cohomology group. Consequently, we\\nobtain the Wells exact sequence connecting various automorphism groups and the\\nsecond Poisson cohomology group. Subsequently, we also consider the\\ninducibility for a pair of Poisson algebra derivations, obtain the obstruction\\nand construct the corresponding Wells-type exact sequence.\\n  To get another application, we introduce the notion of a `deformation map' in\\na proto-twilled Poisson algebra. A deformation map unifies various well-known\\noperators such as Poisson homomorphisms, Poisson derivations, crossed\\nhomomorphisms, Rota-Baxter operators of any weight, twisted Rota-Baxter\\noperators, Reynolds operators and modified Rota-Baxter operators on Poisson\\nalgebras. We show that a deformation map $r$ induces a new Poisson algebra\\nstructure and a suitable representation of it. The corresponding Poisson\\ncohomology is defined to be the cohomology of the deformation map $r$. Finally,\\nwe study the formal deformations of the operator $r$ in terms of the\\ncohomology.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RT\", \"categories\": \"math.RT,math.KT,math.RA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T10:26:22Z\"}"}
