{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14880v1\", \"title\": \"Stratification and Rectifiability of Harmonic Map Flows via Tangent\\n  Measures\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we investigate the stratification theory for suitable\\nsolutions of harmonic map flows based on the spatial symmetry of tangent\\nmeasures. Generally, suitable solutions are a category of solutions that\\nsatisfy both the localized energy inequality and the monotonicity formula.\\nBuilding on the modifications and adjustments of quantitative stratifications\\nand Reifenberg-rectifiable theory by Naber and Valtorta, we confirm that each\\nstratum in our model is rectifiable. We also establish an estimate for the\\nMinkowski content of the singular set at each time slice, demonstrating that\\nthe singular set is rectifiable and that our results strengthen previous\\nfindings, which were limited to almost every time slice. Furthermore, under\\ncertain assumptions about the target manifolds that exclude specific tangent\\nflows and measures, our analysis achieves substantial improvements in the\\nregularity of suitable solutions for harmonic map flows.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T06:16:09Z\"}"}
