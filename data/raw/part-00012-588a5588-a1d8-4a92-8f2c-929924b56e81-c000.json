A result about structural stability\\nrestricted to the space of PMTs is obtained using hyperbolic features for the\\ncomponent functions and the pre-singularities set, allowing a holomorphic\\nmotion. Is it defined and analyzed for PMTs the analogous concept of J-stabilty\\nfor rational maps, finding some relations with the general structural\\nstability. The notions of hyperbolic and expansive PMTs are defined, showing\\nthat they are not equivalent and none of them implies structural stability.\\nCombining the previous results and analyzes, sufficient conditions are given\\nfor structural stability. Finally, an example of structural stability in the\\ncomplexified tent maps family is shown.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS,math.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T03:42:08Z\"}"}
