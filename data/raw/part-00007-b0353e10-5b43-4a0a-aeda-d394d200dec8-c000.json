{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05876v1\", \"title\": \"Topological ignition of the stealth coronal mass ejections\", \"summary\": \"One of hot topics in the solar physics are the so-called 'stealth' coronal\\nmass ejections (CME), which are not associated with any appreciable energy\\nrelease events in the lower corona, such as the solar flares. It is sometimes\\nassumed that these phenomena might be produced by some specific physical\\nmechanism, but no particular suggestions were put forward. It is the aim of the\\npresent paper to show that a promising explanation of the stealth CMEs can be\\nbased on the so-called 'topological' ignition of the magnetic reconnection. As\\na theoretical basis, we employ the Gorbachev-Kel'ner-Somov-Shvarts (GKSS) model\\nof formation of the magnetic null point, which is produced by a specific\\nsuperposition of the remote sources (sunspots) rather than by the local current\\nsystems. As follows from our numerical simulations, the topological model\\nexplains very well all basic features of the stealth CMEs: (i) the plasma\\neruption develops without an appreciable heat release from the spot of\\nreconnection, i.e., without the solar flare; (ii) the spot of reconnection\\n(magnetic null point) can be formed far away from the location of the magnetic\\nfield sources; (iii) the trajectories of eruption are strongly curved, which\\ncan explain observability of CMEs generated behind the solar limb. Therefore,\\nthe topological ignition of magnetic reconnection should be interesting both by\\nitself, as a novel physical phenomenon, and as a prognostic tool for\\nforecasting the stealth CMEs and the resulting unexpected geomagnetic storms.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,physics.space-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T10:04:57Z\"}"}
