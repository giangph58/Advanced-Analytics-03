{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15586v1\", \"title\": \"Joint leave-group-out cross-validation in Bayesian spatial models\", \"summary\": \"Cross-validation (CV) is a widely-used method of predictive assessment based\\non repeated model fits to different subsets of the available data. CV is\\napplicable in a wide range of statistical settings. However, in cases where\\ndata are not exchangeable, the design of CV schemes should account for\\nsuspected correlation structures within the data. CV scheme designs include the\\nselection of left-out blocks and the choice of scoring function for evaluating\\npredictive performance.\\n  This paper focuses on the impact of two scoring strategies for block-wise CV\\napplied to spatial models with Gaussian covariance structures. We investigate,\\nthrough several experiments, whether evaluating the predictive performance of\\nblocks of left-out observations jointly, rather than aggregating individual\\n(pointwise) predictions, improves model selection performance. Extending recent\\nfindings for data with serial correlation (such as time-series data), our\\nexperiments suggest that joint scoring reduces the variability of CV estimates,\\nleading to more reliable model selection, particularly when spatial dependence\\nis strong and model differences are subtle.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T05:02:58Z\"}"}
