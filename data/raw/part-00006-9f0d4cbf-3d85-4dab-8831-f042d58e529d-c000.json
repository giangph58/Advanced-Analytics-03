{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03330v1\", \"title\": \"H\\u00f6rmander oscillatory integral operators: a revisit\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we present new proofs for both the sharp $L^p$ estimate and\\nthe decoupling theorem for the H\\\\\\\"ormander oscillatory integral operator. The\\nsharp $L^p$ estimate was previously obtained by Stein\\\\;\\\\cite{stein1} and\\nBourgain-Guth \\\\cite{BG} via the $TT^\\\\ast$ and multilinear methods,\\nrespectively. We provide a unified proof based on the bilinear method for both\\nodd and even dimensions. The strategy is inspired by Barron's work \\\\cite{Bar}\\non the restriction problem. The decoupling theorem for the H\\\\\\\"ormander\\noscillatory integral operator can be obtained by the approach in \\\\cite{BHS},\\nwhere the key observation can be roughly formulated as follows: in a physical\\nspace of sufficiently small scale, the variable setting can be essentially\\nviewed as translation-invariant. In contrast, we reprove the decoupling theorem\\nfor the H\\\\\\\"ormander oscillatory integral operator through the Pramanik-Seeger\\napproximation approach \\\\cite{PS}. Both proofs rely on a scale-dependent\\ninduction argument, which can be used to deal with perturbation terms in the\\nphase function.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T09:00:06Z\"}"}
