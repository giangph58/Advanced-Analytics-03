We introduce an \\\"Expert Index,\\\" comprising\\nseven linguistically informed features, integrated into a\\nSituation-Task-Action-Consequence (STAC) classification model. This hybrid\\nsystem, combining RoBERTa embeddings with the Expert Index, achieves superior\\nprecision in causal link identification compared to pure LLM-based approaches.\\nFinally, a structured five-iteration prompting process refines and constructs\\nconnected causal graphs. Experiments on 100 narrative chapters and short\\nstories demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms GPT-4o and\\nClaude 3.5 in causal graph quality, while maintaining readability. The\\nopen-source tool provides an interpretable, efficient solution for capturing\\nnuanced causal chains in narratives.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T05:09:07Z\"}"}
