Large language models (LLMs), with great\\ncustomization flexibility, hold promises to enable individuals to create their\\nown emotional support agents. In this work, we developed ChatLab, where users\\ncould construct LLM-powered chatbots with additional interaction features\\nincluding voices and avatars. Using a Research through Design approach, we\\nconducted a week-long field study followed by interviews and design activities\\n(N = 22), which uncovered how participants created diverse chatbot personas for\\nemotional reliance, confronting stressors, connecting to intellectual\\ndiscourse, reflecting mirrored selves, etc. We found that participants actively\\nenriched the personas they constructed, shaping the dynamics between themselves\\nand the chatbot to foster open and honest conversations. They also suggested\\nother customizable features, such as integrating online activities and\\nadjustable memory settings. Based on these findings, we discuss opportunities\\nfor enhancing personalized emotional support through emerging AI technologies.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T13:43:13Z\"}"}
