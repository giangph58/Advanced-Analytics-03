{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23961v1\", \"title\": \"Production of open and hidden charm in fixed-target experiments at the\\n  LHC\", \"summary\": \"We discuss the production of $D$ mesons and $J/\\\\psi$ quarkonia in\\nproton-nucleus collisions in the fixed-target LHCb experiment. We consider\\ngluon-gluon fusion within $k_t$-factorization, processes initiated by intrinsic\\ncharm in the nucleon and perturbative recombination mechanism. All the\\nmechanisms seem to be necessary to describe the LHCb experimental data. We get\\nan upper limit for the probability of the large-$x$ $c \\\\bar c$ Fock component\\nin the nucleon, which is slightly less than 1 \\\\%. The recombination mechanism\\nallows the description of $D^0$ and $\\\\bar D^0$ asymmetry observed by the LHCb\\ncollaboration.\\\\\\\\ We also discuss the production of $J/\\\\psi$ quarkonia,\\nincluding color singlet mechanisms. We include $g^* g^* \\\\to J/\\\\psi g$ and $g^*\\ng^* \\\\to \\\\chi_c(1^+,2^+)(\\\\to J/\\\\psi \\\\gamma)$ within $k_t$-factorization\\napproach. Different unintegrated gluon distributions from the literature are\\nused. A reasonable agreement is achieved with some distributions from the\\nliterature.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T11:20:54Z\"}"}
