{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03413v1\", \"title\": \"Normal $4$-pseudomanifolds with a relative 2-skeleton\", \"summary\": \"The study of face-number-related invariants in simplicial complexes is a\\ncentral topic in combinatorial topology. Among these, the invariant $g_2$ plays\\na significant role. For a normal $d$-pseudomanifold $K$ ($d \\\\geq 3$), it is\\nknown that $g_2(K) \\\\geq g_2(lk(v, K))$ for every vertex $v$. If $K$ has at most\\ntwo singularities and satisfies $g_2(K) = g_2(lk(t, K))$ for a singular vertex\\n$t$, then $g_3(K) \\\\geq g_3(lk(t,K))$ holds. A normal $d$-pseudomanifold $K$ is\\ncalled $g_2$- and $g_3$-optimal if $g_2(K) = g_2(lk (t,K))$ and $g_3(K) =\\ng_3(lk (t,K))$ for a singular vertex $t$.\\n  In this article, we establish structural results for normal\\n$4$-pseudomanifolds under $g_2$- and $g_3$-optimality conditions. We show that\\nif $K$ is a normal $4$-pseudomanifold with exactly one singular vertex $t$ and\\nis $g_2$- and $g_3$-optimal at $t$, then $K$ can be obtained from boundary\\ncomplexes of $5$-simplices through a sequence of operations of types vertex\\nfoldings and connected sums. When $K$ has exactly two singularities and is\\n$g_2$- and $g_3$-optimal at one singular vertex, it is derived from the\\nboundary complexes of $4$-simplices through a sequence of operations of types\\none-vertex suspensions, vertex foldings, and connected sums. Alternatively, we\\nprove that if $K$ has two singular vertices and is $g_2$- and $g_3$-optimal at\\none of them, then it arises from boundary complexes of $5$-simplices through a\\nsequence of operations of types vertex foldings, edge foldings, and connected\\nsums.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,math.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T10:39:39Z\"}"}
