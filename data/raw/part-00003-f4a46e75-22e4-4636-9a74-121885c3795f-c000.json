We derive a closed-form formula for\\nthe enumeration of such codewords. Furthermore, we introduce an enhanced\\npartial order based on weight contributions, offering refined tools for code\\ndesign. Our results extend previous work on Type II codewords to a full\\ndescription of Type I codewords and offer new insights into the algebraic\\nstructure underlying decreasing monomial codes, including polar and Reed-Muller\\ncodes.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T07:48:17Z\"}"}
