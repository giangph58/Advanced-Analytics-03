{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19518v1\", \"title\": \"Discrete-time Two-Layered Forgetting RLS Identification under Finite\\n  Excitation\", \"summary\": \"In recent years, adaptive identification methods that can achieve the true\\nvalue convergence of parameters without requiring persistent excitation (PE)\\nhave been widely studied, and concurrent learning has been intensively studied.\\nHowever, the parameter convergence rate is limited for the gradient-based\\nmethod owing to small parameter update gain, and even the introduction of\\nforgetting factors does not work sufficiently. To address this problem, this\\nstudy proposes a novel discrete-time recursive least squares method under\\nfinite excitation (FE) conditions using two forgetting factors (inner and\\nouter) and an augmented regressor matrix comprising a sum of regressor vectors.\\nThe proposed method ensures the PE condition of the augmented regressor matrix\\nunder FE conditions of the regressor vector and allows the properly design of\\nthe forgetting factor without estimator windup and/or destabilization of the\\nsystem. Numerical simulations demonstrate its effectiveness by comparing it\\nwith several conventional methods.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T06:36:59Z\"}"}
