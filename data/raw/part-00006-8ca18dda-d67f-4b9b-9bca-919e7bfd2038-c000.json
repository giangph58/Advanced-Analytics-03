These pulses\\noften arise from the formation of dissipative solitons, which emerge due to a\\nbalance between energy excitation and dissipation. Harnessing the concept of\\nparity-time (PT) symmetry to control this balance, we demonstrate a new type of\\nlaser dissipative solitons hosted in linearly coupled ring cavities. Our\\nexperiments are performed in a laser where the linear hybridized modes are in\\nthe PT-symmetric phase. We experimentally observe the formation of short\\npulses, stabilized by the selective breaking of the PT-symmetry by the Kerr\\nnonlinearity. Our results unlock new possibilities for passive mode-locking by\\nshowing spontaneous pulse formation in PT-symmetric lasers without the need for\\nadditional intricate components such as saturable absorber or non-reciprocal\\nand polarisation sensitive elements.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,nlin.PS\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T17:59:55Z\"}"}
