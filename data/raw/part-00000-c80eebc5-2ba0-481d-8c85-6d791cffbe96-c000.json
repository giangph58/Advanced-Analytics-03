{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10848v1\", \"title\": \"Ichiyo: Fragile and Transient Interaction in Neighborhood\", \"summary\": \"As the Internet develops, social networking and other communication tools\\nhave transformed people's relationships into something fast, visible, and\\ngeographically huge. However, these communication tools have not expanded\\nopportunities for acquainting oneself with neighbors outside one's social\\nnetwork; rather, they have comparatively diminished occasions for interacting\\nwith unfamiliar neighbors by prioritizing communication with existing friends.\\nTherefore, we invented the medium Ichiyo to increase the opportunities to think\\nof neighbors walking along the same street or in the same neighborhood and to\\nexpand the imagination of those who pass by and those who used to be there.\\nThus, users can engage in indirect interaction. We used commercially available\\nlaser cutters to engrave QR codes on leaves that are naturally found in our\\nliving space to prevent environmental invasion. The QR codes lead to a communal\\nspace on the web where users can freely leave messages. By engraving QR codes,\\ninformation can be virtually expanded to be presented. To get the feedback of\\nIchiyo, we let a total of several thousand people experience a new way of\\ncommunication as a part of the exhibition ''iii Exhibition 2022'', an art\\nexhibition at the University of Tokyo. A total of more than 1,000 leaves\\nengraved with QR codes were prepared and scattered at the exhibition site and\\nalong the road from the nearest station to the venue.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.MM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T04:16:48Z\"}"}
