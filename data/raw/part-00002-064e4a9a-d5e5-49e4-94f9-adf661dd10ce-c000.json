{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05249v1\", \"title\": \"Texture2LoD3: Enabling LoD3 Building Reconstruction With Panoramic\\n  Images\", \"summary\": \"Despite recent advancements in surface reconstruction, Level of Detail (LoD)\\n3 building reconstruction remains an unresolved challenge. The main issue\\npertains to the object-oriented modelling paradigm, which requires\\ngeoreferencing, watertight geometry, facade semantics, and low-poly\\nrepresentation -- Contrasting unstructured mesh-oriented models. In\\nTexture2LoD3, we introduce a novel method leveraging the ubiquity of 3D\\nbuilding model priors and panoramic street-level images, enabling the\\nreconstruction of LoD3 building models. We observe that prior low-detail\\nbuilding models can serve as valid planar targets for ortho-rectifying\\nstreet-level panoramic images. Moreover, deploying segmentation on accurately\\ntextured low-level building surfaces supports maintaining essential\\ngeoreferencing, watertight geometry, and low-poly representation for LoD3\\nreconstruction. In the absence of LoD3 validation data, we additionally\\nintroduce the ReLoD3 dataset, on which we experimentally demonstrate that our\\nmethod leads to improved facade segmentation accuracy by 11% and can replace\\ncostly manual projections. We believe that Texture2LoD3 can scale the adoption\\nof LoD3 models, opening applications in estimating building solar potential or\\nenhancing autonomous driving simulations.
