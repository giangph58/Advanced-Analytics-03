{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12769v1\", \"title\": \"On Error Classification from Physiological Signals within Airborne\\n  Environment\", \"summary\": \"Human error remains a critical concern in aviation safety, contributing to\\n70-80% of accidents despite technological advancements. While physiological\\nmeasures show promise for error detection in laboratory settings, their\\neffectiveness in dynamic flight environments remains underexplored. Through\\nlive flight trials with nine commercial pilots, we investigated whether\\nestablished error-detection approaches maintain accuracy during actual flight\\noperations. Participants completed standardized multi-tasking scenarios across\\nconditions ranging from laboratory settings to straight-and-level flight and 2G\\nmanoeuvres while we collected synchronized physiological data. Our findings\\ndemonstrate that EEG-based classification maintains high accuracy (87.83%)\\nduring complex flight manoeuvres, comparable to laboratory performance\\n(89.23%). Eye-tracking showed moderate performance (82.50\\\\%), while ECG\\nperformed near chance level (51.50%). Classification accuracy remained stable\\nacross flight conditions, with minimal degradation during 2G manoeuvres. These\\nresults provide the first evidence that physiological error detection can\\ntranslate effectively to operational aviation environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T09:08:21Z\"}"}
