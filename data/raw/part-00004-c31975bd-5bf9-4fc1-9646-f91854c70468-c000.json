Here, we provide full descriptions\\non the algorithm, and provide theoretical guarantee for the estimation\\nprecision in terms of the root mean squared error. Furthermore, we analyze the\\nperformance of the quantum amplitude estimation algorithm, another variant of\\nthe Heisenberg-limited scaling algorithm, and show how the estimation error is\\nminimized under the circuit structure that resembles the phase estimation\\nalgorithm. We finally describe the details for the numerical evaluation of the\\nquery complexity of the Heisenberg-limited algorithms and sampling-based\\nmethods to make a thorough comparison in the task of estimating fermionic\\n$k$-RDMs.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T17:57:27Z\"}"}
