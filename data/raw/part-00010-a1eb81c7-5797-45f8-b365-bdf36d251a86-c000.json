This work is a sequel to a previous paper, devoted to mathematical\\naspects of our model: construction of the space of coherent states and\\nproperties of elementary observables. We compute transition amplitudes\\ncorresponding to a free motion of a particle between two coherent states. These\\namplitudes are then used to model quantum random walks of free relativistic\\nparticles. Our quantization scheme allows us to recover interference patterns\\noccurring in a standard double-slit experiment, known from the classical\\napproach. This result is obtained by modeling the slits in terms of eigenstates\\nof the position operator and computing transition amplitudes between position\\nand coherent states. We design our model in a way which allows for a future\\ngeneralization to a semi-classical quantization of the geodesic motion in\\ncurved spacetimes.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T07:27:28Z\"}"}
