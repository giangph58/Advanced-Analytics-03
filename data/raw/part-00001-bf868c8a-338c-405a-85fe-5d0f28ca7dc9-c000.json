An ear of $H$ in $D$ is a path or a\\ncycle in $D$ whose ends lie in $H$ but whose internal vertices do not. An\\n\\\\emph{ear decomposition} of a strong digraph $D$ is a nested sequence\\n$(D_0,D_1,\\\\ldots , D_k)$ of strong subdigraphs of $D$ such that: 1) $D_0$ is a\\ncycle, 2) $D_{i+1} = D_i\\\\cup P_i$, where $P_i$ is an ear of $D_i$ in $D$, for\\nevery $i\\\\in \\\\{0,1,\\\\ldots,k-1\\\\}$, and 3) $D_k=D$.\\n  In this work, the $\\\\mathcal{LE}_i$ is defined as the family of strong\\ndigraphs, with an ear decomposition such that every ear has a length of at\\nleast $i\\\\geq 1$. It is proved that Seymour's second Neighborhood Conjecture and\\nthe Laborde, Payan, and Soung conjecture, are true in the family\\n$\\\\mathcal{LE}_2$, and the Small quasi-kernel conjecture is true for digraphs in\\n$\\\\mathcal{LE}_3$. Also, some sufficient conditions for a strong nonseparable\\ndigraph in $\\\\mathcal{LE}_2$ with a kernel to imply that the previous\\n(following) subdigraph in the ear decomposition has a kernel too, are\\npresented. It is proved that digraphs in $\\\\mathcal{LE}_2$ have a chromatic\\nnumber at most 3, and a dichromatic number 2 or 3. Finally, the oriented\\nchromatic number of asymmetrical digraphs in $\\\\mathcal{LE}_3$ is bounded by 6,\\nand it is shown that the oriented chromatic number of asymmetrical digraphs in\\n$\\\\mathcal{LE}_2$ is not bounded.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T17:22:44Z\"}"}
