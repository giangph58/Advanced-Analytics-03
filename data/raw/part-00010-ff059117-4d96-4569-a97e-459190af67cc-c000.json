Rigorous upscaling methods not only ensure efficient computation,\\nbut also maintains errors within a priori prescribed limits. This provides a\\nbalance between computational costs and accuracy. However, the most significant\\ndifficulties arise when the conditions under which upscaled models can be\\napplied cease to hold. To address this, we develop an automatic-detecting and\\nadaptive, nonintrusive two-sided hybrid method for multiscale heat transfer and\\napply it to thermal runaway in a battery pack. To allow adaptive hybrid\\nsimulations, two kernels are developed to dynamically map the values between\\nthe fine-scale and the upscaled subdomains in a single simulation. The accuracy\\nof the developed hybrid method is demonstrated through conducting a series of\\nthermal runaway test cases in a battery pack. Our results show that the maximum\\nspatial errors consistently remain below the threshold bounded by upscaling\\nerrors.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T11:28:27Z\"}"}
