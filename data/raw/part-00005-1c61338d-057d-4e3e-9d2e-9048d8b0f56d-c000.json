We have\\ncalculated from first principles the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$\\nunder the effect of pressure and epitaxial strain including correlations by the\\n$GW$ approximation to the many-body self-energy. We find that the Fermi surface\\nis composed of a characteristic cuprate-shape sheet $\\\\beta$ plus a\\nnickelate-specific cylinder $\\\\alpha$, both from Ni $e_g$ orbitals, with a\\nnon-negligible drop in the quasiparticle weight and an effective 1D character.\\nThis topology results from a delicate balance between the Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ hole\\npocket $\\\\gamma$, which is suppressed by correlations, and an emerging\\nLa-5$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electron pocket induced by both correlation and\\npressure/strain effects and whose role at low energy has been neglected so far.\\nUnlike cuprates, the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is already\\ncorrectly described from ab initio and in agreement with the experiment without\\nthe need to introduce Hubbard $U$ adjustable parameters or to invoke a strongly\\ncorrelated physics.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T13:55:45Z\"}"}
