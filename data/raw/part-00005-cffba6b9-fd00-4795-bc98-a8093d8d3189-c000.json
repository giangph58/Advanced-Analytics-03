{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11810v1\", \"title\": \"Light WIMPs and MeV Gamma-ray Detection with COSI\", \"summary\": \"Light weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), whose masses are in the\\nsub-GeV scale, have been attracting more attention due to the negative results\\nsearching for traditional WIMPs. The light WIMPs are expected to produce gamma\\nrays from annihilation in the MeV energy region. Advancements in technology\\nhave opened up possibilities to precisely detect MeV gamma rays, leading to the\\nupcoming space-based mission of the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI). We\\ncomprehensively and quantitatively study the phenomenology of light WIMPs to\\ndetermine if the COSI observations will probe their viable model parameter\\nregions. We first construct models to describe light WIMPs based on the\\nminimality and renormalizability of quantum field theory. Next, we impose\\nvarious constraints on the models obtained from cosmological observations (CMB,\\nBBN) and dark matter searches (accelerator, underground, astrophysical\\nexperiments, etc.). Finally, we identify viable parameter regions in each model\\nand discuss whether or not COSI will be sensitive to the parameter regions. We\\nfind that a velocity-dependent annihilation cross-section is predicted in some\\nregions, enabling COSI to detect the dark matter signal while avoiding severe\\nconstraints from cosmological observations.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T06:48:42Z\"}"}
