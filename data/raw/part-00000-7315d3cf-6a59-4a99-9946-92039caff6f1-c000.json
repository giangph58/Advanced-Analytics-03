To address this, we propose a\\nnovel framework that bridges embodied cognition theory and agent systems by\\nleveraging a formal characterization of image schemas, which are defined as\\nrecurring patterns of sensorimotor experience that structure human cognition.\\nBy customizing LLMs to translate natural language descriptions into formal\\nrepresentations based on these sensorimotor patterns, we will be able to create\\na neurosymbolic system that grounds the agent's understanding in fundamental\\nconceptual structures. We argue that such an approach enhances both efficiency\\nand interpretability while enabling more intuitive human-agent interactions\\nthrough shared embodied understanding.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:01:39Z\"}"}
