{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11774v1\", \"title\": \"PCDiff: Proactive Control for Ownership Protection in Diffusion Models\\n  with Watermark Compatibility\", \"summary\": \"With the growing demand for protecting the intellectual property (IP) of\\ntext-to-image diffusion models, we propose PCDiff -- a proactive access control\\nframework that redefines model authorization by regulating generation quality.\\nAt its core, PCDIFF integrates a trainable fuser module and hierarchical\\nauthentication layers into the decoder architecture, ensuring that only users\\nwith valid encrypted credentials can generate high-fidelity images. In the\\nabsence of valid keys, the system deliberately degrades output quality,\\neffectively preventing unauthorized exploitation.Importantly, while the primary\\nmechanism enforces active access control through architectural intervention,\\nits decoupled design retains compatibility with existing watermarking\\ntechniques. This satisfies the need of model owners to actively control model\\nownership while preserving the traceability capabilities provided by\\ntraditional watermarking approaches.Extensive experimental evaluations confirm\\na strong dependency between credential verification and image quality across\\nvarious attack scenarios. Moreover, when combined with typical post-processing\\noperations, PCDIFF demonstrates powerful performance alongside conventional\\nwatermarking methods. This work shifts the paradigm from passive detection to\\nproactive enforcement of authorization, laying the groundwork for IP management\\nof diffusion models.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T05:28:50Z\"}"}
