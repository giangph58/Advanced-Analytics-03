{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11024v1\", \"title\": \"Easy3D: A Simple Yet Effective Method for 3D Interactive Segmentation\", \"summary\": \"The increasing availability of digital 3D environments, whether through\\nimage-based 3D reconstruction, generation, or scans obtained by robots, is\\ndriving innovation across various applications. These come with a significant\\ndemand for 3D interaction, such as 3D Interactive Segmentation, which is useful\\nfor tasks like object selection and manipulation. Additionally, there is a\\npersistent need for solutions that are efficient, precise, and performing well\\nacross diverse settings, particularly in unseen environments and with\\nunfamiliar objects. In this work, we introduce a 3D interactive segmentation\\nmethod that consistently surpasses previous state-of-the-art techniques on both\\nin-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Our simple approach integrates a\\nvoxel-based sparse encoder with a lightweight transformer-based decoder that\\nimplements implicit click fusion, achieving superior performance and maximizing\\nefficiency. Our method demonstrates substantial improvements on benchmark\\ndatasets, including ScanNet, ScanNet++, S3DIS, and KITTI-360, and also on\\nunseen geometric distributions such as the ones obtained by Gaussian Splatting.\\nThe project web-page is available at https://simonelli-andrea.github.io/easy3d.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T09:49:51Z\"}"}
