{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16490v1\", \"title\": \"Microscopic theory of the inverse Faraday effect in a multiorbital\\n  model: Role of orbital magnetic moment and electric dipole\", \"summary\": \"We theoretically investigate the inverse Faraday effect (IFE), a phenomenon\\nwhere circularly-polarized light induces a magnetic moment, in a multiorbital\\nmetallic system. We demonstrate that the total magnetic moment can be\\ndecomposed into several contributions in multiorbital tight-binding models. In\\nparticular, we reveal that the electric dipole moment of Wannier orbitals also\\ncontributes to the orbital magnetic moment, which is not included in the\\nconventional expression for the orbital magnetic moment in lattice systems. To\\naccount for all possible contributions, we adopt an $s$-$p$ tight-binding\\nsystem as a minimal model for the IFE. Using an analytical approach based on\\nthe Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we clarify the physical origins of these\\ncontributions. Additionally, we quantitatively evaluate each contribution on an\\nequal footing through a numerical approach based on the Floquet formalism. Our\\nresults reveal that the orbital magnetic moment exhibits a significantly larger\\nresponse compared to the spin magnetic moment, with all contributions to the\\norbital magnetic moment being comparable in magnitude. These findings highlight\\nthe essential role of orbital degrees of freedom in the IFE.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T08:04:22Z\"}"}
