{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06815v1\", \"title\": \"SVG-IR: Spatially-Varying Gaussian Splatting for Inverse Rendering\", \"summary\": \"Reconstructing 3D assets from images, known as inverse rendering (IR),\\nremains a challenging task due to its ill-posed nature. 3D Gaussian Splatting\\n(3DGS) has demonstrated impressive capabilities for novel view synthesis (NVS)\\ntasks. Methods apply it to relighting by separating radiance into BRDF\\nparameters and lighting, yet produce inferior relighting quality with artifacts\\nand unnatural indirect illumination due to the limited capability of each\\nGaussian, which has constant material parameters and normal, alongside the\\nabsence of physical constraints for indirect lighting. In this paper, we\\npresent a novel framework called Spatially-vayring Gaussian Inverse Rendering\\n(SVG-IR), aimed at enhancing both NVS and relighting quality. To this end, we\\npropose a new representation-Spatially-varying Gaussian (SVG)-that allows\\nper-Gaussian spatially varying parameters. This enhanced representation is\\ncomplemented by a SVG splatting scheme akin to vertex/fragment shading in\\ntraditional graphics pipelines. Furthermore, we integrate a physically-based\\nindirect lighting model, enabling more realistic relighting. The proposed\\nSVG-IR framework significantly improves rendering quality, outperforming\\nstate-of-the-art NeRF-based methods by 2.5 dB in peak signal-to-noise ratio\\n(PSNR) and surpassing existing Gaussian-based techniques by 3.5 dB in\\nrelighting tasks, all while maintaining a real-time rendering speed.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T12:11:58Z\"}"}
