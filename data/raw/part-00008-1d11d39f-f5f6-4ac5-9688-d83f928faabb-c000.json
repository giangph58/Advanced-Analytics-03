The goal is discussing how\\nmaterials and devices of organic bioelectronics can be exploited and used at\\nthe interface with biology, but also how, and at what extent, they can be\\nadapted to mimicking nature-inspired properties, herein including\\nunconventional computing strategies. The idea is to provide new hints and solid\\nhypotheses for designing niche experiments that could benefit from a proper\\ninteraction, even at a basic communicative level, between materials science and\\nbiotechnology. The finale long-term vision goal being the vision of collecting\\nexperimental data that may help to made a step forward toward the\\nimplementation of the transition from inanimate objects to animated beings. The\\nmathematical model canonically considered in this work is the\\nNavier-Stokes-Nernst-Planck (NPNS) Model which is often used to model a charged\\ncontinuum system such as the organic electrochemical transistors.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn,physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T17:17:45Z\"}"}
