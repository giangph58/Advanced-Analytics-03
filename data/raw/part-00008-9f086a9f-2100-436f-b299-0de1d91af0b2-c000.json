{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04320v1\", \"title\": \"Multi-turn Consistent Image Editing\", \"summary\": \"Many real-world applications, such as interactive photo retouching, artistic\\ncontent creation, and product design, require flexible and iterative image\\nediting. However, existing image editing methods primarily focus on achieving\\nthe desired modifications in a single step, which often struggles with\\nambiguous user intent, complex transformations, or the need for progressive\\nrefinements. As a result, these methods frequently produce inconsistent\\noutcomes or fail to meet user expectations. To address these challenges, we\\npropose a multi-turn image editing framework that enables users to iteratively\\nrefine their edits, progressively achieving more satisfactory results. Our\\napproach leverages flow matching for accurate image inversion and a\\ndual-objective Linear Quadratic Regulators (LQR) for stable sampling,\\neffectively mitigating error accumulation. Additionally, by analyzing the\\nlayer-wise roles of transformers, we introduce a adaptive attention\\nhighlighting method that enhances editability while preserving multi-turn\\ncoherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly\\nimproves edit success rates and visual fidelity compared to existing methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T11:11:23Z\"}"}
