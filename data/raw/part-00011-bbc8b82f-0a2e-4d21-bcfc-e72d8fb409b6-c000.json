The rationale for employing the concept of radial epiderivatives is\\nthat they provide necessary and sufficient conditions for both identifying\\nglobal descent directions and achieving global minimum of nonconvex and\\nnondifferentiable functions. These properties of radial epiderivatives are\\ncombined with line search methods to develop iterative solution algorithms. The\\nproposed methods generate search directions at each iteration where global\\ndescent directions and stopping criteria are performed by using the abilities\\nof the radial epiderivatives. We use two line search methods, that is cyclic\\ncoordinate and particle swarm optimization techniques to generate search\\ndirections, selecting only those that exhibit descent, as determined by using\\napproximately computed radial epiderivatives at the current point. As a\\nparticular case, these methods are applied for minimizing concave functions. In\\nthe paper, two convergence theorems are proved. One of them deals with the\\ngeneral line search method and covers only the set of directions generated by\\nthe method. The second convergence theorem deals with minimizing concave\\nfunctions which deals not only with the generated set of directions but covers\\nthe whole set of feasible solutions. The performance of the proposed method is\\nevaluated by using well-known benchmark problems from the literature. The\\nresults demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach in generating\\noptimal or near-optimal solutions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:59:59Z\"}"}
