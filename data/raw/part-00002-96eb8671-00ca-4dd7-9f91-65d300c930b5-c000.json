In many of these cases, the treated and\\ncontrol units correspond to spatial units such as regions or neighborhoods. Our\\napproach addresses the challenge of understanding how an intervention applied\\nat specific locations influences the surrounding area. Traditional synthetic\\ncontrol applications may struggle with defining the effective area of impact,\\nthe extent of treatment propagation across space, and the variation of effects\\nwith distance from the treatment sites. To address these challenges, we\\nintroduce Spatial Vertical Regression (SVR) within the Bayesian paradigm. This\\ninnovative approach allows us to accurately predict the outcomes in varying\\nproximities to the treatment sites, while meticulously accounting for the\\nspatial structure inherent in the data. Specifically, rooted on the vertical\\nregression framework of the synthetic control method, SVR employs a Gaussian\\nprocess to ensure that the imputation of missing potential outcomes for areas\\nof different distance around the treatment sites is spatially coherent,\\nreflecting the expectation that nearby areas experience similar outcomes and\\nhave similar relationships to control areas. This approach is particularly\\npertinent to our study on the Florentine tramway's first line construction. We\\nstudy its influence on the local commercial landscape, focusing on how business\\nprevalence varies at different distances from the tram stops.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T10:52:51Z\"}"}
