Additionally, they are\\nextremely useful for designing components for neutron optical devices. We\\nprovide an overview on materials that have been tested and successfully used to\\ncontrol beams of cold and very cold neutrons based on diffractive elements.\\nArtificial gratings are generated and optimized for the specific application in\\nmind. We discuss the needs of the neutron optics community and highlight the\\nprogress obtained during the last decade. Materials that have been employed so\\nfar along with their properties are summarized, outlining the most promising\\ncandidates for the construction of an interferometer for very cold neutrons.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T12:25:41Z\"}"}
