{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21359v1\", \"title\": \"Ultra-discretization of Yang-Baxter maps, probability distributions and\\n  independence preserving property\", \"summary\": \"We study the relationship between Yang-Baxter maps and the independence\\npreserving (IP) property, motivated by their role in integrable systems, from\\nthe perspective of ultra-discretization. Yang-Baxter maps satisfy the\\nset-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation, while the IP property ensures independence\\nof transformed random variables. The relationship between these two seemingly\\nunrelated properties has recently started to be studied in arXiv:0911.2895 .\\nUltra-discretization is a concept primarily used in the context of integrable\\nsystems and is an area of active research, serving as a method for exploring\\nthe connections between different integrable systems. However, there are few\\nstudies on how the stationary distribution for integrable systems changes\\nthrough ultra-discretization. In this paper, we introduce the concept of\\nultra-discretization for probability distributions, and prove that the\\nproperties of being a Yang-Baxter map and having the IP property are both\\npreserved under ultra-discretization. Applying this to quadrirational\\nYang-Baxter maps, we confirm that their ultra-discrete versions retain these\\nproperties, yielding new examples of piecewise linear maps having the IP\\nproperty. We also explore implications of our results for stationary\\ndistributions of integrable systems and pose several open questions.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.SI\", \"categories\": \"nlin.SI,math-ph,math.MP,math.PR,math.QA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T06:37:21Z\"}"}
