For\\nthis class of spaces the self-dual Weyl tensor is type-[D] in the\\nPetrov-Penrose classification. The anti-self-dual Weyl tensor is algebraically\\ndegenerate, equivalently, there exists an anti-self-dual congruence of null\\nstrings. It is assumed that this congruence is parallely propagated. Thus, the\\nspaces are not only para-Hermite but also Walker. A classification of the\\nspaces according to three criteria is given.
