The major\\nchallenge for sub-micron Cu(In,Ga)Se2 cells is the recombination at the\\nbackside. In standard Cu(In,Ga)Se2 backside recombination is suppressed by a\\nbandgap gradient, acting as a back surface field. This gradient is difficult to\\nmaintain in sub-micron thick absorbers. In this study, a hole transport layer\\npassivates the back contact and enables efficient sub-micron Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar\\ncells without the need of a Ga gradient. The backside passivation by the hole\\ntransport layer is as effective as an optimized Ga gradient, resulting in a\\nsignificant increase in open-circuit voltage by 80 mV in comparison to the\\nreference sample without passivation. Moreover, the hole transport layer\\nexhibits good transport properties, leading to a fill factor as high as 77%.\\nPhotoluminescence quantum yield of 0.15% and solar cell efficiency above 18%\\nare demonstrated in sub-micron Cu(In,Ga)Se2 absorbers.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T07:29:29Z\"}"}
