These theoretical results are then applied to\\nmodel complex dynamical networks, with supporting numerical experiments. This\\nwork mainly makes two contributions: (i) generalization of existing results for\\ndiffusion equations on graphs to cases with nontrivial potentials, producing\\nricher analytical results; (ii) a new PDE approach to model complex dynamical\\nnetworks, with preliminary numerical experiments confirming its validity.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T04:06:12Z\"}"}
