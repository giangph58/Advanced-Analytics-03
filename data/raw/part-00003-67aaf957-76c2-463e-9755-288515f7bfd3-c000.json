Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have\\nemerged as key components for enhancing the LocTrack performance. This paper\\ninvestigates a multi-RIS-assisted multi-user (MRMU) LocTrack system, where\\nmultiple RISs collaboratively reflect the position-bearing signals for\\ninformation fusion at the base station, leveraging spatial-temporal\\ncorrelations in user positions. While studies have shown these correlations\\nimprove localization accuracy, their trade-offs with system complexity remain\\nunclear. To address this gap, we characterize the effectiveness of\\nspatial-temporal correlation priors (STPs) utilization in MRMU LocTrack systems\\nusing a metric, termed efficiency of correlation (EoC). To further elucidate\\ncorrelation propagation and RIS interactions, we provide a \\\"correlation\\ninformation routing\\\" interpretation of EoC through random walk theory. EoC\\nprovides a principled performance evaluation metric, that enables system\\ndesigners to balance localization accuracy enhancement against the increased\\ncomplexity. Additionally, we investigate the error propagation phenomenon,\\nanalyzing its convergence and asymptotic behavior in MRMU LocTrack systems.\\nFinally, we validate the theoretical results through extensive numerical\\nsimulations.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T07:35:41Z\"}"}
