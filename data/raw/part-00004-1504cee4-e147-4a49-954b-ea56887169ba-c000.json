{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05792v1\", \"title\": \"Pinching-Antenna Assisted ISAC: A CRLB Perspective\", \"summary\": \"Recently, pinching antennas have attracted significant research interest due\\nto their capability to reconfigure wireless channels as well as their array\\nconfiguration flexibility. This letter focuses on how these features can be\\nused to support integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) from the Cramer\\nRao lower bound (CRLB) perspective. In particular, the CRLB achieved by\\npinching antennas is first derived and then compared to that of conventional\\nantennas. The presented analytical and simulation results demonstrate that\\nusing pinching antennas can significantly reduce CRLB and, hence, enhance\\npositioning accuracy. In addition, this letter also reveals that the low-cost\\nand reconfigurability features of pinching antennas can be utilized to realize\\nflexible user-centric positioning.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,eess.SP,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T08:21:58Z\"}"}
