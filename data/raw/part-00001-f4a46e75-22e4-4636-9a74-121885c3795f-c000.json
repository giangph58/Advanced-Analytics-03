We\\nfirst prove that the cosection localized virtual cycle of a quasi-smooth\\nderived Deligne-Mumford stack with a $(-1)$-shifted closed $1$-form is equal to\\nthe virtual Lagrangian cycle of the degeneracy locus which is $(-2)$-shifted\\nsymplectic. We next establish a shifted analogue of the Lagrange multipliers\\nmethod which gives us the quantum Lefschetz theorems as immediate consequences\\nof the equality of virtual cycles. Lastly we study derived algebraic geometry\\nenhancements of gauged linear sigma models which lead us to the relative\\nvirtual cycles in a general and natural form.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T07:47:47Z\"}"}
