While this method has saved many lives, human error remains\\na significant challenge, as missing a polyp could have fatal consequences for\\nthe patient. Deep learning (DL) polyp detectors offer a promising solution.\\nHowever, existing DL polyp detectors often mistake white light reflections from\\nthe endoscope for polyps, which can lead to false positives.To address this\\nchallenge, in this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation approach that\\nartificially adds more white light reflections to create harder training\\nscenarios. Specifically, we first generate a bank of artificial lights using\\nthe training dataset. Then we find the regions of the training images that we\\nshould not add these artificial lights on. Finally, we propose a sliding window\\nmethod to add the artificial light to the areas that fit of the training\\nimages, resulting in augmented images. By providing the model with more\\nopportunities to make mistakes, we hypothesize that it will also have more\\nchances to learn from those mistakes, ultimately improving its performance in\\npolyp detection. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our new\\ndata augmentation method.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:51:00Z\"}"}
