A total of 137 XRT\\nobservations have been carried out, summing up to a total effective exposure\\ntime of 114 ks and covering a total of 66 orbital and 19 superorbital cycles of\\nthe source. The XRT data folded on the orbital period of the source confirmed\\nand improved the previously reported variability in intensity and absorption\\ncolumn density, which can be ascribed to the neutron star accreting from the\\nwind of its B supergiant companion across a fairly circular orbit. The XRT data\\nfolded on the superorbital period did not provide evidence of significant\\nvariations in either the absorption column density and/or the power-law photon\\nindex. This may be due to a significant weakening of the superorbital\\nmodulation during the times when the XRT observations were carried out, as\\nconfirmed by the BAT dynamic power spectrum. We discuss the implications of\\nthese findings within the corotating interaction region model proposed to\\ninterpret the superorbital variability in wind-fed supergiant X-ray binaries.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:21:15Z\"}"}
