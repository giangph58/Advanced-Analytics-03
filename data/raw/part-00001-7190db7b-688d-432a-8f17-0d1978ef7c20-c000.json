{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12788v1\", \"title\": \"ARAP-GS: Drag-driven As-Rigid-As-Possible 3D Gaussian Splatting Editing\\n  with Diffusion Prior\", \"summary\": \"Drag-driven editing has become popular among designers for its ability to\\nmodify complex geometric structures through simple and intuitive manipulation,\\nallowing users to adjust and reshape content with minimal technical skill. This\\ndrag operation has been incorporated into numerous methods to facilitate the\\nediting of 2D images and 3D meshes in design. However, few studies have\\nexplored drag-driven editing for the widely-used 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)\\nrepresentation, as deforming 3DGS while preserving shape coherence and visual\\ncontinuity remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce ARAP-GS, a\\ndrag-driven 3DGS editing framework based on As-Rigid-As-Possible (ARAP)\\ndeformation. Unlike previous 3DGS editing methods, we are the first to apply\\nARAP deformation directly to 3D Gaussians, enabling flexible, drag-driven\\ngeometric transformations. To preserve scene appearance after deformation, we\\nincorporate an advanced diffusion prior for image super-resolution within our\\niterative optimization process. This approach enhances visual quality while\\nmaintaining multi-view consistency in the edited results. Experiments show that\\nARAP-GS outperforms current methods across diverse 3D scenes, demonstrating its\\neffectiveness and superiority for drag-driven 3DGS editing. Additionally, our\\nmethod is highly efficient, requiring only 10 to 20 minutes to edit a scene on\\na single RTX 3090 GPU.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GR\", \"categories\": \"cs.GR,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T09:37:11Z\"}"}
