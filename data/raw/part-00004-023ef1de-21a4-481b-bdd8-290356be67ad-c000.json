{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11392v1\", \"title\": \"Probing General Relativity-Induced Decoherence Using an on-chip Sagnac\\n  Interferometer\", \"summary\": \"The intersection of quantum mechanics and general relativity remains an open\\nfrontier in fundamental physics, with few experimentally accessible phenomena\\nconnecting the two. Recent theoretical proposals suggest that relativistic\\nproper time can act as a source of decoherence in quantum systems, providing a\\ntestable overlap between the two theories. Here, we propose a chip-integrated\\nSagnac interferometer where rotation induces a proper time difference between\\nclockwise and counterclockwise single-photon paths. When this time delay\\nexceeds the photon's coherence time, interference visibility is predicted to\\ndecrease, offering a direct signature of relativistic time dilation-induced\\ndecoherence. We theoretically derive the proper time difference arising from\\nthe Sagnac effect and estimate that for a loop radius of 18.9 cm and a rotation\\nspeed of 1000 rad/s, decoherence should occur for single-photon wavepackets\\nwith a coherence time of 10 femtoseconds. We also present a practical chip\\ndesign that accommodates the required high-speed mechanical rotation and\\nincludes an all-optical readout scheme to eliminate wiring constraints. This\\napproach enables a stable, on-chip implementation using realistic parameters,\\nwith rotation speed serving as a continuously tunable knob to control\\ndecoherence. Our platform opens a new route for experimentally probing the\\ninterplay between quantum coherence and relativistic proper time in a scalable\\nand compact form.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T17:01:16Z\"}"}
