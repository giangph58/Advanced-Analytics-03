Evidence highlights the critical role of statistical learning an\\nimplicit cognitive process of the brain in musical creativity and\\nindividuality. Despite its significance, the precise neural and computational\\nmechanisms underpinning these dynamic and embodied cognitive processes re-main\\npoorly understood. This paper discusses how individuality and creativity emerge\\nwithin the framework of the brain's statistical learning, drawing on a series\\nof neural and computational studies. This work offers perspectives on the\\nmechanisms driving the heterogeneous nature of statistical learning abilities\\nand embodied mechanisms and provides a framework to explain the paradoxical\\nphenomenon where individuals with specific cognitive traits that limit certain\\nperceptual abilities excel in creative domains.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.NC\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.NC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T05:09:07Z\"}"}
