{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21785v1\", \"title\": \"Frozen Gaussian Grid-point Correction For Semi-classical Schr\\u00f6dinger\\n  Equation\", \"summary\": \"We propose an efficient reconstruction algorithm named the frozen Gaussian\\ngrid-point correction (FGGC) for computing the Schr\\\\\\\"odinger equation in the\\nsemi-classical regime using the frozen Gaussian approximation (FGA). The FGA\\nhas demonstrated its superior efficiency in dealing with semi-classical\\nproblems and high-frequency wave propagations. However, reconstructing the wave\\nfunction from a large number of Gaussian wave-packets is typically\\ncomputationally intensive. This difficulty arises because these wave-packets\\npropagate along the FGA trajectories to non-grid positions, making the\\napplication of the fast Fourier transform infeasible. In this work, we\\nintroduce the concept of ``on-grid correction'' and derive the formulas for the\\nleast squares approximation of Gaussian wave-packets, and also provide a\\ndetailed process of the FGGC algorithm. Furthermore, we rigorously prove that\\nthe error introduced by the least squares approximation on each Gaussian\\nwave-packet is independent of the semi-classical parameter $\\\\varepsilon$.\\nNumerical experiments show that the FGGC algorithm can significantly improve\\nreconstruction efficiency while introducing only negligible error, making it a\\npowerful tool for solving the semi-classical Schr\\\\\\\"odinger equation, especially\\nin applications requiring both accuracy and efficiency.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T16:43:28Z\"}"}
