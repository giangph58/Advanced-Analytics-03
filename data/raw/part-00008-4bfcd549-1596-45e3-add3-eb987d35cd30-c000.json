{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21504v1\", \"title\": \"Baryon asymmetry from higher-order matter contributions in gravity\", \"summary\": \"We investigate the observed asymmetry between matter and antimatter by\\nincorporating higher-order matter contributions in gravity, specifically\\nanalyzing gravitational baryogenesis within the framework of $\\nf(R,\\\\mathcal{T}^2) $ gravity, where $ R $ is the Ricci scalar and $\\n\\\\mathcal{T}^2 \\\\equiv T_{\\\\mu\\\\nu}T^{\\\\mu\\\\nu} $. We further explore the impact of\\nhigh-order matter contributions by considering an interaction term analogous to\\nthose in gravitational and spontaneous baryogenesis, constructed using $\\n\\\\mathcal{T}^2 $. The cutoff energy scale of the new interaction term is\\npresented and its implications to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) are discussed.\\nThe properties and implications of this term are analyzed within the frameworks\\nof General Relativity and $f(R, \\\\mathcal{T}^2)$ gravity. Furthermore, a\\nconnection to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) is established, providing an\\nobservational constraint on the functional form of $f(R, \\\\mathcal{T}^2)$. By\\nintroducing $\\\\mathcal{T}^2$ into the gravitational action, we propose that\\nthese modifications could significantly influence the early Universe's\\ndynamics, thereby altering the conditions necessary for baryogenesis to occur.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T10:47:40Z\"}"}
