It is\\nobserved that upon inclusion of the EPI, the system demonstrates emergent\\nFloquet QSH (FQSH) phases and several topological phase transitions therein,\\nmediated solely by the interaction strength. Quite intriguingly, the emergence\\nof topological zero ($\\\\pi$) modes in the bulk that remains otherwise gapless in\\nthe vicinity of the $\\\\pi$ (zero) energy sector is observed, thus serving as a\\nprime candidate of robust topology in gapless systems. With other invariants\\nbeing found to be deficient in characterizing such coexistent phases, a\\nspectral localizer (SL) is employed, which distinctly ascertains the nature of\\nthe (zero or $\\\\pi$) edge modes. Following the SL prescription, a real-space\\nChern marker computed by us further provides support to such \\\\textit{gapless}\\nFloquet topological scenario. Our results can be realized in advanced optical\\nsetups that may underscore the importance of EPI-induced Floquet features.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T12:42:27Z\"}"}
