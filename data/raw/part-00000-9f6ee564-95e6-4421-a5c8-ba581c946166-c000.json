However, modality gaps and limited annotations\\npresent significant challenges. We propose a few-shot metric learning method\\nwith a dual-channel attention mechanism and a pretrained vision transformer to\\nenable robust cross-modal neuron identification. The local and global channels\\nextract soma morphology and fiber context, respectively, and a gating mechanism\\nfuses their outputs. To enhance the model's fine-grained discrimination\\ncapability, we introduce a hard sample mining strategy based on the\\nMultiSimilarityMiner algorithm, along with the Circle Loss function.\\nExperiments on two-photon and fMOST datasets demonstrate superior Top-K\\naccuracy and recall compared to existing methods. Ablation studies and t-SNE\\nvisualizations validate the effectiveness of each module. The method also\\nachieves a favorable trade-off between accuracy and training efficiency under\\ndifferent fine-tuning strategies. These results suggest that the proposed\\napproach offers a promising technical solution for accurate single-cell level\\nmatching and multimodal neuroimaging integration.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,q-bio.NC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T08:45:23Z\"}"}
