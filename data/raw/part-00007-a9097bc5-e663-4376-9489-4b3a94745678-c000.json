{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16057v1\", \"title\": \"Automated Static Vulnerability Detection via a Holistic Neuro-symbolic\\n  Approach\", \"summary\": \"Static vulnerability detection is still a challenging problem and demands\\nexcessive human efforts, e.g., manual curation of good vulnerability patterns.\\nNone of prior works, including classic program analysis or Large Language Model\\n(LLM)-based approaches, have fully automated such vulnerability pattern\\ngenerations with reasonable detection accuracy. In this paper, we design and\\nimplement, MoCQ, a novel holistic neuro-symbolic framework that combines the\\ncomplementary strengths of LLMs and classical static analysis to enable\\nscalable vulnerability detection. The key insight is that MoCQ leverages an LLM\\nto automatically extract vulnerability patterns and translate them into\\ndetection queries, and then on static analysis to refine such queries in a\\nfeedback loop and eventually execute them for analyzing large codebases and\\nmining vulnerabilities. We evaluate MoCQ on seven types of vulnerabilities\\nspanning two programming languages. We found MoCQ-generated queries uncovered\\nat least 12 patterns that were missed by experts. On a ground truth dataset,\\nMoCQ achieved comparable precision and recall compared to expert-crafted\\nqueries. Moreover, MoCQ has identified seven previously unknown vulnerabilities\\nin real-world applications, demonstrating its practical effectiveness. We have\\nresponsibly disclosed them to the corresponding developers.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T17:33:53Z\"}"}
