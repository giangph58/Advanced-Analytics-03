{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16019v1\", \"title\": \"Cosmic Clues from Amaterasu: Blazar-Driven Ultrahigh-Energy Cosmic Rays?\", \"summary\": \"The detection of the 244 EeV Amaterasu event by the Telescope Array, one of\\nthe most energetic ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs; $E\\\\gtrsim0.1$ EeV)\\nobserved to date, invites scrutiny of its potential source. We investigate\\nwhether the nearby blazar PKS 1717+177, located within $2.5^\\\\circ$ of the\\nreconstructed arrival direction, could explain the event under a proton-primary\\nhypothesis. Using a one-zone jet model, we fit the multi-wavelength spectral\\nenergy distribution of the source, incorporating both leptonic and hadronic\\ncascade emission from photohadronic interactions. Our model supports a\\ncosmic-ray origin of the very-high-energy ($E\\\\gtrsim 100$ GeV) $\\\\gamma$-ray\\nflux and predicts a subdominant neutrino flux, an order of magnitude lower than\\nfrom TXS 0506+056. Under Lorentz invariance violation, protons above a specific\\nenergy can propagate over hundreds of Mpc without significant energy loss for\\ncertain parameter choices. In such a scenario, our analysis indicates\\nnegligible deflection in the Galactic magnetic field, implying a strong\\nextragalactic magnetic field, placing a lower bound on the field strength. Our\\nfindings provide a compelling multi-messenger framework linking UHECRs,\\n$\\\\gamma$ rays, and neutrinos and motivate targeted searches by current and\\nfuture high-energy neutrino telescopes during increased $\\\\gamma$-ray or X-ray\\nactivity of this blazar.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T16:29:32Z\"}"}
