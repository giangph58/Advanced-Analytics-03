{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10166v1\", \"title\": \"Fact-Checking with Contextual Narratives: Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented\\n  LLMs for Social Media Analysis\", \"summary\": \"We propose CRAVE (Cluster-based Retrieval Augmented Verification with\\nExplanation); a novel framework that integrates retrieval-augmented Large\\nLanguage Models (LLMs) with clustering techniques to address fact-checking\\nchallenges on social media. CRAVE automatically retrieves multimodal evidence\\nfrom diverse, often contradictory, sources. Evidence is clustered into coherent\\nnarratives, and evaluated via an LLM-based judge to deliver fact-checking\\nverdicts explained by evidence summaries. By synthesizing evidence from both\\ntext and image modalities and incorporating agent-based refinement, CRAVE\\nensures consistency and diversity in evidence representation. Comprehensive\\nexperiments demonstrate CRAVE's efficacy in retrieval precision, clustering\\nquality, and judgment accuracy, showcasing its potential as a robust\\ndecision-support tool for fact-checkers.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MM\", \"categories\": \"cs.MM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T12:21:27Z\"}"}
