{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01355v1\", \"title\": \"A Practical Guide to Estimating Conditional Marginal Effects: Modern\\n  Approaches\", \"summary\": \"This Element offers a practical guide to estimating conditional marginal\\neffects-how treatment effects vary with a moderating variable-using modern\\nstatistical methods. Commonly used approaches, such as linear interaction\\nmodels, often suffer from unclarified estimands, limited overlap, and\\nrestrictive functional forms. This guide begins by clearly defining the\\nestimand and presenting the main identification results. It then reviews and\\nimproves upon existing solutions, such as the semiparametric kernel estimator,\\nand introduces robust estimation strategies, including augmented inverse\\npropensity score weighting with Lasso selection (AIPW-Lasso) and double machine\\nlearning (DML) with modern algorithms. Each method is evaluated through\\nsimulations and empirical examples, with practical recommendations tailored to\\nsample size and research context. All tools are implemented in the accompanying\\ninterflex package for R.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,econ.EM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T05:00:14Z\"}"}
