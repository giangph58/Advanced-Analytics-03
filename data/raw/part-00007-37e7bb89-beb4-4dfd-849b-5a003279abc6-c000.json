In\\nthis paper, we introduce SlimSpeech, a lightweight and efficient speech\\nsynthesis system based on rectified flow. We have built upon the existing\\nspeech synthesis method utilizing the rectified flow model, modifying its\\nstructure to reduce parameters and serve as a teacher model. By refining the\\nreflow operation, we directly derive a smaller model with a more straight\\nsampling trajectory from the larger model, while utilizing distillation\\ntechniques to further enhance the model performance. Experimental results\\ndemonstrate that our proposed method, with significantly reduced model\\nparameters, achieves comparable performance to larger models through one-step\\nsampling.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SD\", \"categories\": \"cs.SD,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:15:18Z\"}"}
