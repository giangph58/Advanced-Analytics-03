The\\napplication of finite element mesh makes the neural network element space\\nsatisfy the boundary value conditions directly on the complex geometric\\ndomains. The use of neural networks allows the accuracy of the approximate\\nsolution to reach the high level of neural network approximation even for the\\nproblems with singularities. We also provide the error analysis of the proposed\\nmethod for the understanding. The proposed numerical method in this paper\\nprovides the way to enable neural network-based machine learning algorithms to\\nsolve a broader range of problems arising from engineering applications.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T16:32:30Z\"}"}
