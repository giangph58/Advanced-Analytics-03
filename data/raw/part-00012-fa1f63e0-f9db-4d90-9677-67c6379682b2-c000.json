To address this gap, we present ARWI, a new\\nwriting assistant that helps learners improve essay writing in Modern Standard\\nArabic. ARWI is the first publicly available Arabic writing assistant to\\ninclude a prompt database for different proficiency levels, an Arabic text\\neditor, state-of-the-art grammatical error detection and correction, and\\nautomated essay scoring aligned with the Common European Framework of Reference\\nstandards for language attainment. Moreover, ARWI can be used to gather a\\ngrowing auto-annotated corpus, facilitating further research on Arabic grammar\\ncorrection and essay scoring, as well as profiling patterns of errors made by\\nnative speakers and non-native learners. A preliminary user study shows that\\nARWI provides actionable feedback, helping learners identify grammatical gaps,\\nassess language proficiency, and guide improvement.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T07:00:47Z\"}"}
