{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07935v1\", \"title\": \"Stacking-induced ferroelectricity in tetralayer graphene\", \"summary\": \"Recent studies have reported emergent ferroelectric behavior in twisted or\\nmoir\\\\'e-engineered graphene-based van der Waals heterostructures, yet the\\nmicroscopic origin of this effect remains under debate. Pristine mono- or\\nfew-layer graphene lacks a permanent dipole due to its centrosymmetric lattice,\\nmaking the emergence of ferroelectricity unlikely. However, mixed-stacked\\ngraphene, such as the ABCB tetralayer configuration, breaks both inversion and\\nmirror symmetry and has been theoretically predicted to support electrically\\nswitchable dipoles. ABCB graphene represents the simplest natural graphene\\npolytype exhibiting intrinsic out-of-plane polarization, arising from\\nasymmetric charge carrier distribution across its layers. Here, we report\\nrobust ferroelectric behavior in dual-gated, non-aligned ABCB tetralayer\\ngraphene encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride. The device exhibits\\npronounced hysteresis in resistance under both top and bottom gate modulation,\\nwith the effect persisting up to room temperature. This hysteresis originates\\nfrom reversible layer-polarized charge reordering, driven by gate-induced\\ntransitions between ABCB and BCBA stacking configurations -- without requiring\\nmoir\\\\'e superlattices. Our findings establish stacking-order-induced symmetry\\nbreaking as a fundamental route to electronic ferroelectricity in graphene and\\nopen pathways for non-volatile memory applications based on naturally occurring\\nmixed-stacked multilayer graphene.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:49:10Z\"}"}
