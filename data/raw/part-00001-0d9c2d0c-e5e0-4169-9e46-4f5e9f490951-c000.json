{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05198v1\", \"title\": \"Polymorphic spin ordering in a single-crystalline cobalt-doped Fe3GaTe2\", \"summary\": \"A single crystalline system typically stabilizes a unique state for spin\\nordering below a critical temperature. Certain materials exhibit multiple\\nmagnetic states, driven by structural phase transitions under varying\\nthermodynamic conditions. Recently, van der Waals magnets have demonstrated\\nsubtle interlayer exchange interactions, offering a promising approach to\\nelectrically control spin states without structural transformation. Here, we\\nreport the emergence of three distinct magnetic states, ferromagnetic ordering\\nand both collinear and non-collinear antiferromagnetic orderings, in a layered\\nsingle crystalline magnet, cobalt-doped Fe3GaTe2 ((Co, Fe)3GaTe2). These three\\nmagnetic phases occur without structural phase transitions, a phenomenon we\\ndesignate as polymorphic spin ordering in the material. The introduction of 16%\\nCo-doping in Fe3GaTe2 modulates the interlayer magnetic interaction, enabling\\nmultiple spin orderings within the same lattice system with three critical\\ntemperatures: a Curie temperature for a ferromagnetic state (Tc=210 K) and two\\nNeel temperatures for the collinear (TN1=110 K) and non-collinear (TN2=30 K)\\nantiferromagnetic states. Our findings are supported by magnetic force\\nmicroscopy, first-principles calculations, and circular dichroism angular\\nphotoemission spectroscopy, which reveals varying spin ordering and changes in\\nthe topological band structure and Berry curvature at different temperatures\\nwithin the single-crystalline (Co, Fe)3GaTe2.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T12:55:16Z\"}"}
