Nonlinear electrodynamics\\n(NED) offers a mechanism for constructing regular BHs that evade singularities.\\nWe perform a geometrical and observational analysis of NED-inspired BHs,\\nconstraining the magnetic parameter via Bayesian inference using EHT data,\\nobtaining \\\\( q = 0.98^{+0.09}_{-0.08} \\\\) for M87* and \\\\( q = 1.10\\\\pm0.10 \\\\) for\\nSgr A*. Deviations from Schwarzschild BHs manifest in horizon structure, shadow\\nproperties, and lensing effects. We analyze BH shadows under plasma conditions,\\nidentifying imprints of NED on strong-field processes. Future observations from\\nLISA, next-generation X-ray telescopes, and EHT will further constrain these\\ndeviations and provide tests for alternative gravity theories.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:00:35Z\"}"}
