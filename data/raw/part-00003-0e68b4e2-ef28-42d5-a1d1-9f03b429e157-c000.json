{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16748v1\", \"title\": \"Simple Graph Contrastive Learning via Fractional-order Neural Diffusion\\n  Networks\", \"summary\": \"Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has recently made progress as an\\nunsupervised graph representation learning paradigm. GCL approaches can be\\ncategorized into augmentation-based and augmentation-free methods. The former\\nrelies on complex data augmentations, while the latter depends on encoders that\\ncan generate distinct views of the same input. Both approaches may require\\nnegative samples for training. In this paper, we introduce a novel\\naugmentation-free GCL framework based on graph neural diffusion models.\\nSpecifically, we utilize learnable encoders governed by Fractional Differential\\nEquations (FDE). Each FDE is characterized by an order parameter of the\\ndifferential operator. We demonstrate that varying these parameters allows us\\nto produce learnable encoders that generate diverse views, capturing either\\nlocal or global information, for contrastive learning. Our model does not\\nrequire negative samples for training and is applicable to both homophilic and\\nheterophilic datasets. We demonstrate its effectiveness across various\\ndatasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T14:17:28Z\"}"}
