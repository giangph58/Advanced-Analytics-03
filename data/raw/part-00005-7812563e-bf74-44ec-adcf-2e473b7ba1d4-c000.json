It is generally assumed that\\nproof techniques that do not relativize with respect to quantum oracles will\\nalso not relativize with respect to classical oracles. In this note, we show\\nthat this is not the case: specifically, we show that there is a quantum oracle\\nproblem that is contained in the class QMA, but not in a class we call\\npolyQCPH. The class polyQCPH is equal to PSPACE with respect to classical\\noracles, and it is a well-known result that QMA is contained in PSPACE (also\\nwith respect to classical oracles).\\n  We also show that the same separation holds relative to a distributional\\noracle, which is a model introduced by Natarajan and Nirkhe (2024). We believe\\nour findings show the need for some caution when using these non-standard\\noracle models, particularly when showing separations between quantum and\\nclassical resources.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.CC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T04:20:39Z\"}"}
