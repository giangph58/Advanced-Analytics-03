In this paper, we present\\nDRAWER, a novel framework that converts a video of a static indoor scene into a\\nphotorealistic and interactive digital environment. Our approach centers on two\\nmain contributions: (i) a reconstruction module based on a dual scene\\nrepresentation that reconstructs the scene with fine-grained geometric details,\\nand (ii) an articulation module that identifies articulation types and hinge\\npositions, reconstructs simulatable shapes and appearances and integrates them\\ninto the scene. The resulting virtual environment is photorealistic,\\ninteractive, and runs in real time, with compatibility for game engines and\\nrobotic simulation platforms. We demonstrate the potential of DRAWER by using\\nit to automatically create an interactive game in Unreal Engine and to enable\\nreal-to-sim-to-real transfer for robotics applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T17:59:49Z\"}"}
