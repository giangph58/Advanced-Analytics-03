The AMT is poised to observe at millimetre and possibly at submillimetre\\nwavelengths. At these wavelengths, precipitable water vapour (PWV) in the\\natmosphere is the main source of opacity during observations and therefore\\nneeds to be accurately assessed at the potential sites for the AMT. In order to\\ninvestigate the PWV conditions for the AMT, identical Global Navigation\\nSatellite System (GNSS) stations were installed and used to assess the PWV at\\nthe two potential sites. In this study, the accuracy of those PWV measurements\\nby the GNSS stations was assessed by comparing the H.E.S.S. installed GNSS\\nstation PWV measurements to that from a 210 GHz Water Vapour Radiometer (WVR)\\nalso installed at the H.E.S.S. site. A correlation of 98% and an offset of 0.34\\nmm was found between the GNSS station and the 210 GHz WVR PWV data when on-site\\npressure and the Nevada Geodetic Laboratory (NGL) weighted mean temperature\\n($\\\\mathrm{T_m}$) were used calculate the GNSS station PWV data. In comparison,\\nthe offset reduces to 0.15 mm when on-site derived $\\\\mathrm{T_m}$ and pressure\\nwere used to calculate the GNSS station PWV. The results show that the GNSS\\nstation with on-site meteorological data can be used with high accuracy to\\nreliably determine the PWV conditions at the H.E.S.S. site.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM,physics.ao-ph,physics.data-an\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:33:24Z\"}"}
