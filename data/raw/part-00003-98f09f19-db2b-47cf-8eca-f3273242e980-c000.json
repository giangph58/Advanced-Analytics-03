{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10405v1\", \"title\": \"Performance of Large Language Models in Supporting Medical Diagnosis and\\n  Treatment\", \"summary\": \"The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into healthcare holds\\nsignificant potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy and support medical\\ntreatment planning. These AI-driven systems can analyze vast datasets,\\nassisting clinicians in identifying diseases, recommending treatments, and\\npredicting patient outcomes. This study evaluates the performance of a range of\\ncontemporary LLMs, including both open-source and closed-source models, on the\\n2024 Portuguese National Exam for medical specialty access (PNA), a\\nstandardized medical knowledge assessment. Our results highlight considerable\\nvariation in accuracy and cost-effectiveness, with several models demonstrating\\nperformance exceeding human benchmarks for medical students on this specific\\ntask. We identify leading models based on a combined score of accuracy and\\ncost, discuss the implications of reasoning methodologies like\\nChain-of-Thought, and underscore the potential for LLMs to function as valuable\\ncomplementary tools aiding medical professionals in complex clinical\\ndecision-making.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI,cs.ET,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:53:59Z\"}"}
