{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03217v1\", \"title\": \"Accelerating Evolution: Integrating PSO Principles into Real-Coded\\n  Genetic Algorithm Crossover\", \"summary\": \"This study introduces an innovative crossover operator named Particle Swarm\\nOptimization-inspired Crossover (PSOX), which is specifically developed for\\nreal-coded genetic algorithms. Departing from conventional crossover approaches\\nthat only exchange information between individuals within the same generation,\\nPSOX uniquely incorporates guidance from both the current global best solution\\nand historical optimal solutions across multiple generations. This novel\\nmechanism enables the algorithm to maintain population diversity while\\nsimultaneously accelerating convergence toward promising regions of the search\\nspace. The effectiveness of PSOX is rigorously evaluated through comprehensive\\nexperiments on 15 benchmark test functions with diverse characteristics,\\nincluding unimodal, multimodal, and highly complex landscapes. Comparative\\nanalysis against five state-of-the-art crossover operators reveals that PSOX\\nconsistently delivers superior performance in terms of solution accuracy,\\nalgorithmic stability, and convergence speed, especially when combined with an\\nappropriate mutation strategy. Furthermore, the study provides an in-depth\\ninvestigation of how different mutation rates influence PSOX's performance,\\nyielding practical guidelines for parameter tuning when addressing optimization\\nproblems with varying landscape properties.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NE\", \"categories\": \"cs.NE,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T06:17:57Z\"}"}
