{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10929v1\", \"title\": \"Cross-Frequency Implicit Neural Representation with Self-Evolving\\n  Parameters\", \"summary\": \"Implicit neural representation (INR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for\\nvisual data representation. However, classical INR methods represent data in\\nthe original space mixed with different frequency components, and several\\nfeature encoding parameters (e.g., the frequency parameter $\\\\omega$ or the rank\\n$R$) need manual configurations. In this work, we propose a self-evolving\\ncross-frequency INR using the Haar wavelet transform (termed CF-INR), which\\ndecouples data into four frequency components and employs INRs in the wavelet\\nspace. CF-INR allows the characterization of different frequency components\\nseparately, thus enabling higher accuracy for data representation. To more\\nprecisely characterize cross-frequency components, we propose a cross-frequency\\ntensor decomposition paradigm for CF-INR with self-evolving parameters, which\\nautomatically updates the rank parameter $R$ and the frequency parameter\\n$\\\\omega$ for each frequency component through self-evolving optimization. This\\nself-evolution paradigm eliminates the laborious manual tuning of these\\nparameters, and learns a customized cross-frequency feature encoding\\nconfiguration for each dataset. We evaluate CF-INR on a variety of visual data\\nrepresentation and recovery tasks, including image regression, inpainting,\\ndenoising, and cloud removal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CF-INR\\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods in each case.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T07:14:35Z\"}"}
