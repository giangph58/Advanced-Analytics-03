{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17750v1\", \"title\": \"Pure Chromo-Natural Inflation: Signatures of Particle Production from\\n  Weak to Strong Backreaction\", \"summary\": \"We consider, in the context of axion-inflation, the \\\\textit{Pure Natural\\nInflation} (PNI) model coupled with an SU(2) gauge sector via a Chern-Simons\\nterm. As the axion rolls down its potential, it dissipates energy in the gauge\\nsector thus sourcing fluctuations of scalar and tensor degrees of freedom\\ntherein. Gauge field fluctuations will, in turn, feed primordial gravitational\\nwaves as well as curvature perturbations. Remarkably, we can use upcoming\\ncosmological probes to test this mechanism across a vast range of scales, from\\nthe CMB to laser interferometers. Due to their flat plateau at large field\\nvalues, we find that PNI potentials fare better vis-\\\\'{a}-vis CMB observations\\nthan the conventional sinusoidal potential of chromo-natural inflation (CNI).\\nWe show that, even when the dynamics begin in the weak backreaction regime, the\\nrolling of the axion leads to a build-up of the gauge-quanta production,\\ninvariably triggering the strong backreaction of the gauge sector tensors on\\nthe background dynamics. This transition results in the copious production of\\nboth scalar and tensor perturbations, which we study in detail. The\\ngravitational wave signatures include a rich peak structure with a\\ncharacteristic scale-dependent chirality, a compelling target for future\\ngravitational wave detectors. Additionally, the peak in scalar perturbations\\nmay lead to the formation of primordial black holes, potentially accounting for\\na significant fraction of the observed dark matter abundance.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T17:09:15Z\"}"}
