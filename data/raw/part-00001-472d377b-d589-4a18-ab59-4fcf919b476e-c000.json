{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16571v1\", \"title\": \"LaSDVS : A Post-Quantum Secure Compact Strong-Designated Verifier\\n  Signature\", \"summary\": \"Digital signatures are fundamental cryptographic primitives that ensure the\\nauthenticity and integrity of digital communication. However, in scenarios\\ninvolving sensitive interactions -- such as e-voting or e-cash -- there is a\\ngrowing need for more controlled signing mechanisms. Strong-Designated Verifier\\nSignature (SDVS) offers such control by allowing the signer to specify and\\nrestrict the verifier of a signature. The existing state-of-the-art SDVS are\\nmostly based on number-theoretic hardness assumptions. Thus, they are not\\nsecure against quantum attacks. Moreover, Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)-based\\nSDVS are inefficient and have large key and signature sizes. In this work, we\\naddress these challenges and propose an efficient post-quantum SDVS (namely,\\nLaSDVS) based on ideal lattices under the hardness assumptions of the Ring-SIS\\nand Ring-LWE problems. LaSDVS achieves advanced security properties including\\nstrong unforgeability under chosen-message attacks, non-transferability,\\nnon-delegatability, and signer anonymity. By employing the algebraic structure\\nof rings and the gadget trapdoor mechanism of Micciancio et al., we design\\nLaSDVS to minimize computational overhead and significantly reduce key and\\nsignature sizes. Notably, our scheme achieves a compact signature size of\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}(n\\\\log q)$, compared to $\\\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ size, where $n$ is the\\nsecurity parameter, in the existing state-of-the-art PQC designs. To the best\\nof our knowledge, LaSDVS offers the \\\\textit{smallest private key and signature\\nsize} among the existing PQC-based SDVS schemes.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T09:48:18Z\"}"}
