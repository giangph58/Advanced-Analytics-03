The complex wave\\nvectors and their corresponding complex angles of the incident, reflected and\\nrefracted waves are easily calculated from the tangential wave vector based on\\nthe phase matching condition and Snell's law. The relationship between two\\ndifferent schemes of electric field compositions is interpreted and the\\nelectric field magnitudes of the incident, reflected and refracted waves were\\ndeduced from the tangential electric field magnitude of the incident wave where\\nthe tangential boundary condition of electric fields is directly utilized. The\\ntime-averaged Poynting vectors and the surface Joule heat density at the\\ninterface are also given to demonstrate the validity of our proposed\\nmethodology by the energy balance condition together with a specific example.\\nIt is also found that the external surface charges with a practical surface\\ncharge density have little effect on the reflection and transmission of\\nelectromagnetic waves since the surface conductivity of interface is negligibly\\nsmall. Our work opens a new and fast route for calculating the reflected and\\ntransmitted waves at a charged and lossy planar interface without the need to\\nperform the traditional polarization decomposition of arbitrarily polarized\\nincident plane waves.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T03:26:14Z\"}"}
