{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03402v1\", \"title\": \"Fabrication-tolerant frequency conversion in thin film lithium niobate\\n  waveguide with layer-poled modal phase matching\", \"summary\": \"Thanks to its high quadratic nonlinear susceptibilty and low propagation\\nlosses, thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) on insulator is an ideal platform for\\nlaser frequency conversion and generation of quantum states of light. Frequency\\nconversion is usually achieved by quasi-phase matching (QPM) via electric-field\\npoling. However, this scheme shows very high sensitivity to the dimensions of\\nthe waveguide, poling period and duty cycle, resulting in a lack of\\nrepeatability of the phase matched wavelength and efficiency, which in turn\\nlimits the spread of TFLN frequency converters in complex circuits and hinders\\nwafer-scale production. Here we propose a layer-poled modal phase matching\\n(MPM) that is 5 to 10 times more robust towards fabrication uncertainties and\\ntheoretically more efficient than conventional QPM. By selectively poling the\\nbottom part of the waveguide all along its length, second harmonic is\\nefficiently generated on a higher order waveguide's mode. We validate this\\napproach by poling TFLN waveguides as a post-process after the fabrication in a\\nfoundry process. We perform a tolerance analysis and compare the experimental\\nresults with conventional QPM second harmonic generation process on the same\\nwaveguides. Then, we show how MPM can be exploited to obtain efficient\\nintraband frequency conversion processes at telecom wavelengths by leveraging\\nsimultaneous second harmonic and difference frequency generation in the same\\nwaveguide.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T10:29:36Z\"}"}
