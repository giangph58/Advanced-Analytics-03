{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07833v1\", \"title\": \"Operator growth in many-body systems of higher spins\", \"summary\": \"We study operator growth in many-body systems with on-site spins larger than\\n$1/2$, considering both non-integrable and integrable regimes. Specifically, we\\ncompute Lanczos coefficients in the one- and two-dimensional Ising models for\\nspin values $S=1/2$, $1$, and $3/2$, and observe asymptotically linear growth\\n$b_n \\\\sim n$. On the integrable side, we investigate the Potts model and find\\nsquare-root growth $b_n \\\\sim \\\\sqrt{n}$. Both results are consistent with the\\npredictions of the Universal Operator Growth Hypothesis. To analyze operator\\ndynamics in this setting, we employ a generalized operator basis constructed\\nfrom tensor products of shift and clock operators, extending the concept of\\nPauli strings to higher local dimensions. We further report that the recently\\nintroduced formalism of equivalence classes of Pauli strings can be naturally\\nextended to this setting. This formalism enables the study of simulable\\nHeisenberg dynamics by identifying dynamically isolated operator subspaces of\\nmoderate dimensionality. As an example, we introduce the Kitaev-Potts model\\nwith spin-$1$, where the identification of such a subspace allows for exact\\ntime evolution at a computational cost lower than that of exact\\ndiagonalization.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:10:28Z\"}"}
