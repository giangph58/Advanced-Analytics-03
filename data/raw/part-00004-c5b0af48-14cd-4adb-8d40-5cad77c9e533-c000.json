This study\\nemploys causal and counterfactual path-specific effects to quantify how various\\nfactors, including socioeconomic status, insurance access, health behaviors,\\nand health status, mediate these disparities. Using data from the Medical\\nExpenditures Panel Survey, we estimate how expenditures would differ under\\ncounterfactual scenarios in which the values of specific mediators were aligned\\nacross racial groups along selected causal pathways. A key challenge in this\\nanalysis is ensuring robustness against model misspecification while addressing\\nthe zero-inflation and right-skewness of healthcare expenditures. For reliable\\ninference, we derive asymptotically linear estimators by integrating influence\\nfunction-based techniques with flexible machine learning methods, including\\nsuper learners and a two-part model tailored to the zero-inflated, right-skewed\\nnature of healthcare expenditures.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP,stat.ME,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:23:50Z\"}"}
