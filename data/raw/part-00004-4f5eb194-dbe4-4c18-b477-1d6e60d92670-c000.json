More\\nand more attention has been paid to the qudit quantum systems with larger than\\ntwo dimensions to maximize the potential computing power of quantum\\ncomputation. Then, a natural problem arises: How do we implement quantum\\nalgorithms on qudit quantum systems? In this work, we propose a novel qudit\\nphase gadget method for synthesizing the qudit diagonal unitary matrices. This\\nmethod is suitable for the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) and\\nfault-tolerant eras due to its versatility in different connectivity\\narchitectures and the optimality of its resource consumption. The method can\\nwork on any connectivity architecture with asymptotic optimal circuit depth and\\nsize. For a 10-qutrit diagonal unitary, our algorithm reduces the circuit depth\\nform about 100000 to 500 with 300 ancillary qutrits. Further, this method can\\nbe promoted to different quantum circuit synthesis problems, such as quantum\\nstate preparation problems, general unitary synthesis problems, etc.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.ET\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T07:26:33Z\"}"}
