To this end, we introduce the concept of ideal decomposition\\nin a finite ranked meet-semilattice. Notably, it extends two celebrated\\nconcepts: modular element proposed by Stanley in 1971 and nice partition\\nproposed by Terao in 1992.\\n  The main results are as follows. An ideal decomposition of $L(\\\\mathcal{A})$\\nleads to a factorization of its characteristic polynomial\\n$\\\\chi_{\\\\mathcal{A}}(t)$, which is an extension of Terao's factorization under a\\nnice partition. A special type of two-part ideal decomposition, modular ideal,\\nis studied, which extends Stanley's factorization to affine hyperplane\\narrangements. We also show that any modular ideal of $L(\\\\mathcal{A})$ has a\\ngeometric realization. Moreover, we extend Terao's factorization of the\\nOrlik-Solomon algebra for central arrangements, originally induced by modular\\nelements, to arbitrary affine hyperplane arrangements via the modular ideals.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T16:20:43Z\"}"}
