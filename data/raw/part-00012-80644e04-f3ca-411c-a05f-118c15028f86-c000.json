This particular biasedness might not be desirable\\nin applications and can lead to severe challenges when $\\\\mathsf{A}$ is\\nnon-injective.\\n  We have therefore, in a series of papers, investigated how to \\\"remedy\\\" this\\nfact, relative to a chosen basis and in a certain mathematical sense: Based on\\na weighting procedure, it turns out that it is possible to modify both Tikhonov\\nand sparsity regularization such that each member of the chosen basis can be\\nalmost perfectly recovered from their image under $\\\\mathsf{A}$. In particular,\\nwe have studied this problem for the task of using boundary data to identify\\nthe source term in an elliptic PDE. However, this weighting procedure involves\\n$\\\\mathsf{A}^\\\\dagger \\\\mathsf{A}$, where $\\\\mathsf{A}^\\\\dagger$ denotes the pseudo\\ninverse of $\\\\mathsf{A}$, and can thus be CPU-demanding and lead to undesirable\\nerror amplification.\\n  We therefore, in this paper, study alternative weighting approaches and prove\\nthat some of the recovery results established for the methodology involving\\n$\\\\mathsf{A}$ hold for a broader class of weighting schemes. In fact, it turns\\nout that \\\"any\\\" linear operator $\\\\mathsf{B}$ has an associated proper weighting\\ndefined in terms of images under $\\\\mathsf{B}\\\\mathsf{A}$. We also present a\\nseries of numerical experiments, employing different choices of $\\\\mathsf{B}$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:29:30Z\"}"}
