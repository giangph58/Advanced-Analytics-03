This process, arising from quadratic curvature\\ncorrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action at high energies, circumvents the\\ninconsistencies associated with classical naked singularities. The onset of\\nghost-driven instability signals a phase transition that fundamentally alters\\nblack hole evaporation, rendering the information paradox moot as it merges\\nwith the singularity issue. Our findings suggest a new pathway for black hole\\nevolution at high-energy scales, offering insights that may bridge key gaps\\nuntil a full theory of quantum gravity is realized.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T08:01:28Z\"}"}
