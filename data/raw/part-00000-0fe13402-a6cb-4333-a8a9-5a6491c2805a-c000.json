Here, the\\nalgorithm leverages the unique ability of a neutral atom tweezer platform to\\nrealize arbitrary qubit position configurations. These configurations determine\\nthe degree of entanglement available to a variational quantum algorithm via the\\ninteratomic interactions. Good configurations will accelerate pulse\\noptimization convergence and help mitigate barren plateaus. As gradient-based\\napproaches are ineffective for position optimization due to the divergent\\n$R^{-6}$ nature of neutral atom interactions, we opt to use a consensus-based\\nalgorithm to optimize the qubit positions. By sampling the configuration space\\ninstead of using gradient information, the consensus-based algorithm is able to\\nsuccessfully optimize the positions, yielding adapted variational quantum\\nalgorithm ansatzes that lead to both faster convergence and lower errors. In\\nthis work, we show that these optimized configurations generally result in\\nlarge improvements in the system's ability to solve ground state minimization\\nproblems for both random Hamiltonians and small molecules.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T09:07:49Z\"}"}
