However, grids based on intermittent\\nrenewables are challenged by diurnal and seasonal mismatch between supply of\\nsun and wind and demand for electricity, including for heat pumps and electric\\ntwo and four wheelers. Load management and demand response measures promise to\\nadjust for this mismatch, utilizing information- and price-based approaches to\\nsteer demand towards times with high supply of intermittent renewables. Here,\\nwe systematically review the literature estimating CO2 savings from residential\\nload management in developing and developed nations. We find that load\\nmanagement holds high potential, locally differentiated with energy mix\\n(including the respective share of renewables and fossils), climate zone, and\\nthe regulatory environment and price mechanism. Most identified studies suggest\\na mitigation potential between 1 and 20%. Load management becomes more relevant\\nwith higher shares of intermittent renewables, and when electricity prices are\\nhigh. Importantly, load management aligns consumers' financial incentives with\\nclimate change mitigation, thus rendering accompanying strategies politically\\nfeasible. We summarize key regulatory steps to facilitate load management in\\neconomies and to realize relevant consumer surplus and mitigation potential.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T17:55:12Z\"}"}
