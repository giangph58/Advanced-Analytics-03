A merit function is considered, wherein\\nthe set of nonlinear inequality constraints is divided into two groups: one\\ntreated with a logarithmic barrier approach, and another, along with the\\nequality constraints, addressed using a penalization term. This strategy, is\\nadapted and incorporated into a direct search method, enabling the effective\\nhandling of general nonlinear constraints. Convergence to KKT-stationary points\\nis established under continuous differentiability assumptions, without\\nrequiring any kind of convexity. Using CUTEst test problems, numerical\\nexperiments demonstrate the robustness, efficiency, and overall effectiveness\\nof the proposed method, when compared with state-of-the-art solvers\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:54:01Z\"}"}
