{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16587v1\", \"title\": \"Spin polarization as a probe of the QCD critical point\", \"summary\": \"Spin polarization is a novel method for probing the rotational properties of\\nthe quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. In\\nthis work, we investigate the effective transport and thermodynamic\\ncoefficients in non-central O+O light-ion collisions, considering a parton\\ndistribution function that incorporates the spin polarization induced by\\nthermal vorticity during the collision. Using a kinetic theory approach, we\\nfind that while the speed of sound squared ($c_s^2$) remains largely unaffected\\nby spin polarization, the specific shear viscosity ($\\\\eta/s$), specific bulk\\nviscosity ($\\\\zeta/s$), and mean free path ($\\\\lambda$) are significantly\\nmodified.\\n  Notably, when spin polarization is taken into account, both $c_s^2 $ and\\n$\\\\zeta/s$ exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on collision energy, with an\\ninflection point around $\\\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 27 $~GeV, corresponding to an average\\nparton chemical potential of $\\\\langle\\\\mu_p\\\\rangle = 0.021 $~GeV. This\\nnon-monotonic behavior suggests that incorporating spin polarization into\\ntheoretical calculations could provide an effective probe for locating the\\ncritical point of the QCD phase transition.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T10:08:31Z\"}"}
