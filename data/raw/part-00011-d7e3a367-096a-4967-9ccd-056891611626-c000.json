{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15714v1\", \"title\": \"Autonomous Control of Redundant Hydraulic Manipulator Using\\n  Reinforcement Learning with Action Feedback\", \"summary\": \"This article presents an entirely data-driven approach for autonomous control\\nof redundant manipulators with hydraulic actuation. The approach only requires\\nminimal system information, which is inherited from a simulation model. The\\nnon-linear hydraulic actuation dynamics are modeled using actuator networks\\nfrom the data gathered during the manual operation of the manipulator to\\neffectively emulate the real system in a simulation environment. A neural\\nnetwork control policy for autonomous control, based on end-effector (EE)\\nposition tracking is then learned using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with\\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck process noise (OUNoise) for efficient exploration. The RL\\nagent also receives feedback based on supervised learning of the forward\\nkinematics which facilitates selecting the best suitable action from\\nexploration. The control policy directly provides the joint variables as\\noutputs based on provided target EE position while taking into account the\\nsystem dynamics. The joint variables are then mapped to the hydraulic valve\\ncommands, which are then fed to the system without further modifications. The\\nproposed approach is implemented on a scaled hydraulic forwarder crane with\\nthree revolute and one prismatic joint to track the desired position of the EE\\nin 3-Dimensional (3D) space. With the emulated dynamics and extensive learning\\nin simulation, the results demonstrate the feasibility of deploying the learned\\ncontroller directly on the real system.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T08:55:28Z\"}"}
