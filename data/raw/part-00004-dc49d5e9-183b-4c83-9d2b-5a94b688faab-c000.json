{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04941v1\", \"title\": \"The Kratos Framework for Heterogeneous Astrophysical Simulations: Ray\\n  Tracing, Reacting Flow and Thermochemistry\", \"summary\": \"Thermochemistry, ray-tracing radiation, and radiation-matter interactions are\\nimportant processes which are computationally difficult to model in\\nastrophysical simulations, addressed by introducing novel algorithms optimized\\nfor heterogeneous architectures in the Kratos framework. Key innovations\\ninclude a stoichiometry-compatible reconstruction scheme for consistent\\nchemical species advection, which ensures element conservation while avoiding\\nmatrix inversions, and a LU decomposition method specifically designed for\\nmulti-thread parallelization in order to solve stiff thermochemical ordinary\\ndifferential equations with high efficiency. The framework also implements\\nefficient ray-tracing techniques for radiation transport for radiation-matter\\ninteractions. Various verification tests, spanning from chemical advection,\\ncombustion, Str\\\\\\\"omgren spheres, and detonation dynamics, are conducted to\\ndemonstrate the accuracy and robustness of Kratos, with results closely\\nmatching semi-analytic solutions and benchmarks such as Cantera and the Shock\\nand Detonation Toolbox. The modular design and performance optimizations\\nposition it as a versatile tool for studying coupled microphysical processes in\\nthe diverse environments of contemporary astrophysical studies.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:28:48Z\"}"}
