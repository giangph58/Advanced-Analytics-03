{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19484v1\", \"title\": \"Morphological Feature Distances Among the Spectral Types of SDSS\\n  Galaxies\", \"summary\": \"This study investigates the morphological feature distances among various\\nspectral types of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), including\\nstrong and weak Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), Quasi-Stellar Objects (QSO),\\nquiescent, and star-forming galaxies. We evaluated the clustering and relative\\ndistances of these spectral types in the multidimensional morphological feature\\nspace. The results indicate that AGN and QSOs are more closely associated with\\nquiescent galaxies than with star-forming ones, indicating a potential\\nregulation of star formation by AGN activity. Furthermore, the analysis\\nunderlines the role of AGN feedback in the dwarf regime having $\\\\sim$10~50%\\ncloser distances from AGN types to the quiescent type than to the SF type in\\nthe dwarf regime $-18 > M_r > -20$, compared to $<$15% closer in the massive\\nregime $M_r < -21$. The continuous probability analysis for being Hubble types\\nof the spectral types upholds the distance analysis results having a range of\\nthe probability distribution of AGN types similar to quiescent type, especially\\nin dwarf galaxies.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T05:00:09Z\"}"}
