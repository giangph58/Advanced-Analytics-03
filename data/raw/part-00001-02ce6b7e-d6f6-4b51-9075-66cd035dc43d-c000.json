It has been shown that the appearance\\nof a significant temperature gradient during the quenching of a metallic melt\\nleads to thermodiffusion of defects and their outflow from the melt volume,\\nwhich manifests itself in a significant reduction in the number of free spaces\\nfor the diffusion transfer of the atoms of the melt. Due to the thermodiffusion\\nprocess, a significant restructuring of the microstructure of the medium\\noccurs, which leads to a significant increase in viscosity, a decrease in the\\ndiffusion coefficient and specific volume of the substance, and changes in the\\nmechanisms of deformation. The corresponding calculations of temperature\\ndistribution, thermodiffusion and distribution of the components of the melt\\nhave been carried out.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T07:22:41Z\"}"}
