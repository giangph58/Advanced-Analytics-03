{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03164v1\", \"title\": \"InfoVids: Reimagining the Viewer Experience with Alternative\\n  Visualization-Presenter Relationships\", \"summary\": \"Traditional data presentations typically separate the presenter and\\nvisualization into two separate spaces--the 3D world and a 2D screen--enforcing\\nvisualization-centric stories. To create a more human-centric viewing\\nexperience, we establish a more equitable relationship between the\\nvisualization and the presenter through our InfoVids. These\\ninfographics-inspired informational videos are crafted to redefine\\nrelationships between the presenter and visualizations. As we design InfoVids,\\nwe explore how the use of layout, form, and interactions affects the viewer\\nexperience. We compare InfoVids against their baseline 2D `slides' equivalents\\nacross 9 metrics with 30 participants and provide practical, long-term insights\\nfrom an autobiographical perspective. Our mixed methods analyses reveal that\\nthis paradigm reduced viewer attention splitting, shifted the focus from the\\nvisualization to the presenter, and led to more interactive, natural, and\\nengaging full-body data performances for viewers. Ultimately, InfoVids helped\\nviewers re-imagine traditional dynamics between the presenter and\\nvisualizations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T04:18:42Z\"}"}
