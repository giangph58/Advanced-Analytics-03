They serve as valuable tools for\\nresearchers across disciplines such as history, geography, and urban studies,\\nfacilitating the reconstruction of historical environments and the analysis of\\nspatial transformations over time. However, when constrained to analogue or\\nscanned formats, their interpretation is limited to humans and therefore not\\nscalable. Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly in computer\\nvision and large language models (LLMs), have opened new avenues for automating\\nthe recognition and classification of features and objects in historical maps.\\nIn this paper, we propose a novel distillation method that leverages LLMs and\\nattention mechanisms for the automatic annotation of historical maps. LLMs are\\nemployed to generate coarse classification labels for low-resolution historical\\nimage patches, while attention mechanisms are utilized to refine these labels\\nto higher resolutions. Experimental results demonstrate that the refined labels\\nachieve a high recall of more than 90%. Additionally, the intersection over\\nunion (IoU) scores--84.2% for Wood and 72.0% for Settlement--along with\\nprecision scores of 87.1% and 79.5%, respectively, indicate that most labels\\nare well-aligned with ground-truth annotations. Notably, these results were\\nachieved without the use of fine-grained manual labels during training,\\nunderscoring the potential of our approach for efficient and scalable\\nhistorical map analysis.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T10:34:23Z\"}"}
