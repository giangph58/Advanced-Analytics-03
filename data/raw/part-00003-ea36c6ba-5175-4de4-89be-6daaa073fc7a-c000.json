(2025), I show that\\nwithin their suite of research-engineering tasks the performance of AI agents\\non longer-duration tasks can be explained by an extremely simple mathematical\\nmodel -- a constant rate of failing during each minute a human would take to do\\nthe task. This implies an exponentially declining success rate with the length\\nof the task and that each agent could be characterised by its own half-life.\\nThis empirical regularity allows us to estimate the success rate for an agent\\nat different task lengths. And the fact that this model is a good fit for the\\ndata is suggestive of the underlying causes of failure on longer tasks -- that\\nthey involve increasingly large sets of subtasks where failing any one fails\\nthe task. Whether this model applies more generally on other suites of tasks is\\nunknown and an important subject for further work.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,I.2.8\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T10:31:03Z\"}"}
