We propose a novel gradient-free\\nsurrogate-driven framework combined with mid-circuit measurement and reset of\\nancillary qubits to induce effective nonunitarity. Our approach uses a\\nclassical neural surrogate to predict measurement outcomes from circuit\\nparameters to avoid direct gradients. Theoretical results prove that bypassing\\nquantum gradients mitigates plateau issues. Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and\\nCIFAR-100 with 15-qubit, 6-layer circuits using four resettable ancillas\\ndemonstrate superior accuracy compared to direct-gradient QNNs and classical\\nbaselines. Our method also serves as a potential for a generalized training\\nframework applicable to various QNN architectures beyond image classification.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:51:57Z\"}"}
