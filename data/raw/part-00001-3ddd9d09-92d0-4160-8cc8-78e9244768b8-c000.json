We\\nprove that as the intensity $\\\\lambda$ of the underlying Poisson point process\\ntends to infinity, both critical parameters $p_c(M,\\\\lambda)$ and\\n$p_u(M,\\\\lambda)$ converge to the Euclidean critical parameter\\n$p_c(\\\\mathbb{R}^d)$. This extends a recent result of Hansen & M\\\\\\\"uller in the\\nspecial case $M=\\\\mathbb{H}^2$ to a general class of manifolds of arbitrary\\ndimension. A crucial step in our proof, which may be of independent interest,\\nis to show that if $M$ is simply connected and one-ended, then embedded graphs\\ninduced by a general class of tessellations on $M$ have connected minimal\\ncutsets. In particular, this result applies to $\\\\varepsilon$-nets, allowing us\\nto implement a \\\"fine-graining\\\" argument. We also develop an annealed way of\\nexploring the Voronoi cells that we use to characterize the uniqueness phase.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:49:50Z\"}"}
