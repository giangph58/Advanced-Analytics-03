{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10027v1\", \"title\": \"Deconfined Quantum Critical Point: A Review of Progress\", \"summary\": \"Deconfined quantum critical points (DQCPs) have been proposed as a class of\\ncontinuous quantum phase transitions occurring between two ordered phases with\\ndistinct symmetry-breaking patterns, beyond the conventional framework of\\nLandau-Ginzburg-Wilson (LGW) theory. At the DQCP, the system exhibits emergent\\ngauge fields, fractionalized excitations, and enhanced symmetries. Here we\\nreview recent theoretical and experimental progress on exploring DQCPs in\\ncondensed matter systems. We first introduce theoretical advancements in the\\nstudy of DQCPs over the past twenty years, particularly in magnetic models on\\nsquare lattices, honeycomb lattices, kagome lattices, and one-dimensional spin\\nchains. We then discuss recent progress on experimental realization of DQCP in\\nquantum magnetic systems. Experimentally, the Shastry-Sutherland model,\\nrealized in SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$, offers a particularly promising platform for\\nrealizing DQCPs. The magnetic frustration inherent to this model drives phase\\ntransitions between two distinct symmetry-breaking states: a valence bond solid\\n(VBS) phase and a N\\\\'{e}el antiferromagnetic phase. Remarkably,\\nSrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ has provided the first experimental evidence of a\\nproximate DQCP through a field-induced Bose-Einstein condensation,\\ntransitioning from the VBS state to the N\\\\'{e}el state. Nevertheless, the\\ndirect experimental realization of a DQCP remains a significant challenge.\\nDespite this, it offers a promising platform for exploring emergent phenomena\\nthrough quantum phase transition in low-dimensional quantum systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:31:58Z\"}"}
