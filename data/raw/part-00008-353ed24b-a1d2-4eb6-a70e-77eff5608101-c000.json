In addition to advancing current IIE models, accurately\\nevaluating their output has become increasingly critical and challenging.\\nCurrent IIE evaluation methods and their evaluation procedures often fall short\\nof aligning with human judgment and often lack explainability. To address these\\nlimitations, we propose JUdgement through Routing of Expertise (JURE). Each\\nexpert in JURE is a pre-selected model assumed to be equipped with an atomic\\nexpertise that can provide useful feedback to judge output, and the router\\ndynamically routes the evaluation task of a given instruction and its output to\\nappropriate experts, aggregating their feedback into a final judge. JURE is\\ntrustworthy in two aspects. First, it can effortlessly provide explanations\\nabout its judge by examining the routed experts and their feedback. Second,\\nexperimental results demonstrate that JURE is reliable by achieving superior\\nalignment with human judgments, setting a new standard for automated IIE\\nevaluation. Moreover, JURE's flexible design is future-proof - modular experts\\ncan be seamlessly replaced or expanded to accommodate advancements in IIE,\\nmaintaining consistently high evaluation quality.
