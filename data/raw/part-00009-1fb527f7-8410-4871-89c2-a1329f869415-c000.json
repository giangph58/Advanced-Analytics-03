Assuming the porous medium has symmetric,\\nperiodic structure with a small period $\\\\varepsilon,$ we analyse the limit\\nbehavior of the problem as $\\\\varepsilon \\\\to 0.$ A crucial aspect of this study\\nis deriving correct coupling conditions at the common interface, which is\\nachieved using inner-layer asymptotics. For the flat interface, we construct\\nand justify a complete asymptotic expansion of the solution in the\\n$H^1$-Sobolev space. Furthermore, for the $\\\\varepsilon$-periodically\\noscillating interface of amplitude $\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\varepsilon),$ we provide an\\napproximation to the solution and establish the corresponding asymptotic\\nestimates in $H^1$-Sobolev spaces.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:59:45Z\"}"}
