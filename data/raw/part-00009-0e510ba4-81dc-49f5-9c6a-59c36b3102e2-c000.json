We propose to construct an asymptotic test\\nstatistic for the comparison of one quantile between two treatment groups, as\\nwell as for the comparison of a collection of quantiles. Under the null\\nhypothesis of equality of quantiles, the test statistic follows asymptotically\\na normal distribution in the univariate case and a chi-square with J degrees of\\nfreedom in the multivariate case, with J the number of quantiles compared.\\nDeriving the variance of the test statistic requires the estimation of the\\nprobability density function of the distribution of failure times at the\\nquantile being tested. A resampling method is presented as an alternative to\\nkernel density estimation to perform such task. Extensive simulation studies\\nare performed to show that the proposed approach provides reasonable type I\\nprobabilities and powers. We illustrate the proposed test in a phase III\\nrandomized clinical trial where the proportional hazards assumption between\\ntreatment arms does not hold.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T07:00:48Z\"}"}
