In this paper, we study the\\nelectron-TA phonon couplings in three-dimensional pentatellurides and explore\\nthe conditions under which the TA phonon condensation is stable. We analyze the\\nLindhard response function, phonon softening, mean-field parameters, and\\nrenormalized dispersions, on the basis of which the phase diagrams of the\\nelectron-phonon couplings in ZrTe$_5$ and HfTe$_5$ are calculated. The phase\\ndiagrams show that, if the chemical potential lies near the Weyl nodes, the TA\\nphonon condensation will dominate and lead to the shear strain wave phase. We\\nfurther reveal that when the wave vector of the particular phonon mode is\\nsmaller, the critical coupling strength will be weaker for the phonon\\ncondensation, which thus favors the condensation phase.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T11:44:40Z\"}"}
