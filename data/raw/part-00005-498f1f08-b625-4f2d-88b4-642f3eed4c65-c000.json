Existing perturbation mechanisms\\ntypically require perturbing the original values to ensure acceptable privacy,\\nwhich inevitably results in value distortion and utility deterioration. In this\\nwork, we propose an alternative approach -- instead of perturbing values, we\\napply randomization to indexes of values while ensuring rigorous LDP\\nguarantees. Inspired by the deniability of randomized indexes, we present CRIAD\\nfor answering subset counting queries on set-value data. By integrating a\\nmulti-dummy, multi-sample, and multi-group strategy, CRIAD serves as a fully\\nscalable solution that offers flexibility across various privacy requirements\\nand domain sizes, and achieves more accurate query results than any existing\\nmethods. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive experimental\\nevaluations, we validate the effectiveness of CRIAD and demonstrate its\\nsuperiority over traditional value-perturbation mechanisms.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DB\", \"categories\": \"cs.DB,cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T13:08:11Z\"}"}
