This paper\\nintroduces PRIME (PRoximal Iterative MarkEts), a novel OFO approach based on\\nproximal-point iterations. Unlike existing OFO solutions, PRIME admits a\\nmarket-based implementation, where self-interested actors are incentivized to\\nmake choices that result in a safe and efficient operation, without\\ncommunicating private costs or constraints. Furthermore, PRIME can cope with\\nnon-smooth objective functions, achieve fast convergence rates and rapid\\nconstraint satisfaction, and reject measurement noise. We demonstrate PRIME on\\nan AC optimal power flow problem, obtaining an efficient real-time nonlinear\\nlocal marginal pricing scheme.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T17:25:40Z\"}"}
