This capability enhances robust planning\\nand control in aerial communication networks, enabling more adaptive trajectory\\nplanning and precise antenna alignment without additional mechanical\\ncomponents. These features are particularly valuable in uncertain environments,\\nwhere disturbances such as wind and interference affect communication\\nstability. This paper examines o-MRAVs in the context of robust aerial network\\nplanning, comparing them with the more common under-actuated MRAVs (u-MRAVs).\\nKey applications, including physical layer security, optical communications,\\nand network densification, are highlighted, demonstrating the potential of\\no-MRAVs to improve reliability and efficiency in dynamic communication\\nscenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T13:23:48Z\"}"}
