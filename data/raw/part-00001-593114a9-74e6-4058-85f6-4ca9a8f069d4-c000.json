{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12091v1\", \"title\": \"Locality-aware Pauli-based computation for local magic state preparation\", \"summary\": \"Magic state distillation, a process for preparing magic states needed to\\nimplement non-Clifford gates fault-tolerantly, plays a crucial role in\\nfault-tolerant quantum computation. Historically, it has been a major\\nbottleneck, leading to the pursuit of computation schemes optimized for slow\\nmagic state preparation. Recent advances in magic state distillation have\\nsignificantly reduced the overhead, enabling the simultaneous preparation of\\nmany magic states. However, the magic state transfer cost prevents the\\nconventional layout from efficiently utilizing them, highlighting the need for\\nan alternative scheme optimized for highly parallel quantum algorithms. In this\\nstudy, we propose locality-aware Pauli-based computation, a novel compilation\\nscheme that distills magic states in the computation area, aiming to reduce\\nexecution time by minimizing magic state transfer costs and improving locality.\\nNumerical experiments on random circuit sampling and 2D Ising Hamiltonian\\nsimulation demonstrate that our scheme significantly reduces execution time,\\nwhile incurring little or no additional spatial overhead, compared to\\nsequential Pauli-based computation, a conventional computation scheme, and\\nscales favorably with increasing qubit count.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T13:54:03Z\"}"}
