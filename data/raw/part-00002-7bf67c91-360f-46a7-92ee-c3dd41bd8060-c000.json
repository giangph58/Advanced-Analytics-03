This document aims to provide technical guidance for\\nresearchers starting in the field of ultrastable lasers and to give an outlook\\ntoward the next generation of improved ultrastable lasers. These guidelines\\nhave arisen from the scope of the EMPIR project ``Next generation ultrastable\\nlasers'' ( https://www.ptb.de/empir2021/nextlasers ) with contributions from\\nthe European project partners.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,physics.ins-det\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T16:58:14Z\"}"}
