We believe this is the first reported\\nmethod for such fabrication, and our technique allows for complex, multilayer\\nelectron beam lithography to define metallized layers and structural Si layers\\non these substrates. The insulating underlayer may be removed by a\\nstraightforward wet processing step, leaving suspended single crystal Si\\nmechanical structures. We have fabricated and mechanically tested structures\\nsuch as beam resonators, tuning-fork resonators, and torsional oscillators, all\\nwith smallest dimensions of 0.1-0.2 microns and fundamental resonance\\nfrequencies above 10 MHz.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T17:11:17Z\"}"}
