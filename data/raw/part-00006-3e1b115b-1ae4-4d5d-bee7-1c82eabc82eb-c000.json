Recent interest\\nin qubit-CV hybrid models has revealed a simple, yet important gap in our\\nknowledge, namely, how to fully manipulate superpositions of Gaussian states.\\nIn this paper, we show how to faithfully represent a quadratic Gaussian state\\nin the Fock basis. Specifically, we evaluate the phase necessary to equate the\\nunitary representation of a zero-mean Gaussian state with its Fock\\nrepresentation. This allows for the coherent manipulation of superpositions of\\nGaussian states, especially the evaluation of expectation values from these\\nsuperposed states. We then use this method to model a simple quantum field\\ntheory communication protocol using quadratic detectors in a regime that has\\npreviously been impossible to solve. The result presented in this paper is\\nexpected to become increasingly relevant with hybrid-CV systems, especially in\\nthe strong-coupling regime.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T06:13:36Z\"}"}
