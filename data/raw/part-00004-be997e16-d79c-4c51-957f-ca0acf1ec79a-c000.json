This indicator depends solely on the cell-average data of\\nthe target cell and its immediate neighbours. Once the troubled-cells are\\nidentified, we apply the limiter only in these cells instead of applying in all\\ncomputational cells. We introduce a novel technique to quantify the quality of\\nthe solution in the neighbourhood of the shock by defining a monotonicity\\nparameter $\\\\mu$. Numerical results from various two-dimensional simulations on\\nthe hyperbolic systems of Euler equations using a finite volume solver\\nemploying MUSCL reconstruction validate the performance of the troubled-cell\\nindicator and the approach of limiting only in the troubled-cells. These\\nresults show that limiting only in the troubled-cells is preferable to limiting\\neverywhere as it improves convergence without compromising on the solution\\naccuracy.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.CE,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T10:44:16Z\"}"}
