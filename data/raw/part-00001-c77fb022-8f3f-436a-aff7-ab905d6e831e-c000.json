{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17478v1\", \"title\": \"Prospective sensitivity of CTA on detection of evaporating primordial\\n  black holes\", \"summary\": \"As the lifetime of a black hole decreases, the energy of the Hawking\\nradiation it emits increases, ultimately culminating in its disappearance\\nthrough a powerful burst of gamma rays. For primordial black holes (PBHs) with\\nan initial mass of $\\\\sim 5\\\\times10^{14}$ g, their lifespans are expected to end\\nin the present epoch. Detecting such PBH bursts would provide compelling\\nevidence of their existence. The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) has the\\npotential to observe these bursts at the high-energy end of the gamma-ray\\nspectrum. To investigate this possibility, we conduct a study to evaluate the\\nsensitivity of CTA to the local burst rate density of PBHs. Our results suggest\\nthat during a 5-year observational campaign, CTA could exclude a local burst\\nrate density exceeding $\\\\sim 36\\\\ \\\\mathrm{pc}^{-3}\\\\ \\\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, which\\nrepresents an improvement of one order of magnitude over the upper limit set by\\nthe Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). In addition, we\\npropose an observation strategy optimized for detecting PBH bursts.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T12:09:40Z\"}"}
