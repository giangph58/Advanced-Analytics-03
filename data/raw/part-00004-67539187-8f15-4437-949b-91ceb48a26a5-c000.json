However, in the current research, there are rare study\\nreports about achieving both high spatial quality and low sampling ratio below\\n5% without additional algorithms in the existing SPI architectures. To\\ncircumvent these challenges, here we demonstrate a novel Laguerre Gaussian\\nsingle-pixel imaging (LGSI) technique achieving ultra-low sampling ratio (3%)\\nand super-high spatial imaging quality (Structural Similarity (SSIM) of 0.739\\nand a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 20.762 dB). The fundamental\\nmethodology relies on the enhancement of the encoded patterns by the\\ndifferential modulation of discrete orthogonal physical LG moments, enabling\\nthe reconstruction of illuminated target object via a linear weighting of the\\nstructured light intensity. Leveraging this orthogonal mechanism, LGSI\\ndemonstrates superior imaging quality and computational efficiency, surpassing\\nthe capabilities of non-orthogonal moments. Comparative analyses of the power\\nspectra from reconstructed images highlight the enhanced efficacy of LGSI over\\nHadamard SPI (HSI) and Fourier SPI (FSI). Our results suggest the possibility\\nof encoding multi-dimensional structured light fields as a promising pathway\\nfor realizing low sampling ratio, universal, and physical-endow SPI.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T03:54:13Z\"}"}
