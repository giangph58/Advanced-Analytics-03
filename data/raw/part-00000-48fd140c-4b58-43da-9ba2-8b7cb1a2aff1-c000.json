This problem has applications in\\nstatistics, particularly in the detection of change-points in time series. In\\nthis paper, we propose a semidefinite programming approach for this problem,\\nincorporating compactness in constraints or in objective. We study and compare\\nthe different relaxations, and argue that our method provides high-quality\\nheuristics and tight bounds. In particular, the single hyperparameter of our\\npenalized semidefinite models naturally balances the trade-off between\\ncompactness and accuracy of the computed solutions. Numerical experiments\\nillustrate, on the hardest instances, the effectiveness and versatility of our\\napproach compared to the existing mixed-integer programming formulation.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T13:32:26Z\"}"}
