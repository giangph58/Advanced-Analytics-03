By employing a modified von Mises transformation,\\nwe rigorously prove the far-field convergence of Prandtl solutions to Blasius\\nflow. A weighted energy method is employed to establish the optimal convergence\\nrate assuming that the initial data constitutes a perturbation of the Blasius\\nprofile. Furthermore, a sharp maximum principle technique is applied to derive\\nthe optimal convergence rate for concave initial data. The critical weights and\\ncomparison functions depend on the first eigenfunction of the linearized\\noperator associated with the system.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T08:47:18Z\"}"}
