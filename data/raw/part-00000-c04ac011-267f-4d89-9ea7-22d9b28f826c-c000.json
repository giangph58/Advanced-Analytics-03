The paper, a contribution to the\\nongoing research on generalised regularity properties in generalised\\ndescriptive set theory at singular cardinals of countable cofinality, is aimed\\nat descriptive set theorists, and so it presents the main result in small\\nsteps, slowly increasing the consistency strength lower bound from the\\nexistence of an inner model with a measurable cardinal up to the already\\nmentioned one. For this, the inner model theory and covering properties of the\\nDodd-Jensen core model, $L[U]$ and Koepke's canonical model are used. By giving\\nas much detail as needed at any step, we intend to provide the community with\\nthe necessary tools to deal with consistency strength arguments at the\\ncorresponding levels.\", \"main_category\": \"math.LO\", \"categories\": \"math.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T07:57:02Z\"}"}
