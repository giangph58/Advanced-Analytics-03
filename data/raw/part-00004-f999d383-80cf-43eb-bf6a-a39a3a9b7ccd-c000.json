{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06832v1\", \"title\": \"On a Characterization of Spartan Graphs\", \"summary\": \"The eternal vertex cover game is played between an attacker and a defender on\\nan undirected graph $G$. The defender identifies $k$ vertices to position\\nguards on to begin with. The attacker, on their turn, attacks an edge $e$, and\\nthe defender must move a guard along $e$ to defend the attack. The defender may\\nmove other guards as well, under the constraint that every guard moves at most\\nonce and to a neighboring vertex. The smallest number of guards required to\\ndefend attacks forever is called the eternal vertex cover number of $G$,\\ndenoted $evc(G)$.\\n  For any graph $G$, $evc(G)$ is at least the vertex cover number of $G$,\\ndenoted $mvc(G)$. A graph is Spartan if $evc(G) = mvc(G)$. It is known that a\\nbipartite graph is Spartan if and only if every edge belongs to a perfect\\nmatching. We show that the only K\\\\\\\"onig graphs that are Spartan are the\\nbipartite Spartan graphs. We also give new lower bounds for $evc(G)$,\\ngeneralizing a known lower bound based on cut vertices. We finally show a new\\nmatching-based characterization of all Spartan graphs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DM\", \"categories\": \"cs.DM,math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T12:47:29Z\"}"}
