We first consider the case\\nwithout length penalization and investigate the role of global minimizers among\\ngraph curves in our minimization problem for planar curves. In addition, for\\nlarge values of the length-penalization parameter $\\\\lambda>0$, we expose an\\nexplicit threshold parameter above which minimizers touch the obstacle,\\nregardless of its shape. On contrary, for small values of $\\\\lambda>0$ we show\\nthat the minimizers do not touch the obstacle, and they are given by an\\nexplicit elastica.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T11:33:14Z\"}"}
