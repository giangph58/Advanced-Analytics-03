They called it the QSETH framework. In this paper, using a notion\\nof quantum natural proofs (built from natural proofs introduced by Razborov and\\nRudich), we show how part of the QSETH conjecture that requires properties to\\nbe `compression oblivious' can in many cases be replaced by assuming the\\nexistence of quantum-secure pseudorandom functions, a standard hardness\\nassumption. Combined with techniques from Fourier analysis of Boolean\\nfunctions, we show that properties such as PARITY and MAJORITY are compression\\noblivious for certain circuit class $\\\\Lambda$ if subexponentially secure\\nquantum pseudorandom functions exist in $\\\\Lambda$, answering an open question\\nin [Buhrman-Patro-Speelman 2021].\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.CC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:09:55Z\"}"}
