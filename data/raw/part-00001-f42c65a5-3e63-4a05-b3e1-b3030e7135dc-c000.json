{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03423v1\", \"title\": \"AI-Based Feedback in Counselling Competence Training of Prospective\\n  Teachers\", \"summary\": \"This study explores the use of AI-based feedback to enhance the counselling\\ncompetence of prospective teachers. An iterative block seminar was designed,\\nincorporating theoretical foundations, practical applications, and AI tools for\\nanalysing verbal, paraverbal, and nonverbal communication. The seminar included\\nrecorded simulated teacher-parent conversations, followed by AI-based feedback\\nand qualitative interviews with students. The study investigated correlations\\nbetween communication characteristics and conversation quality, student\\nperceptions of AI-based feedback, and the training of AI models to identify\\nconversation phases and techniques. Results indicated significant correlations\\nbetween nonverbal and paraverbal features and conversation quality, and\\nstudents positively perceived the AI feedback. The findings suggest that\\nAI-based feedback can provide objective, actionable insights to improve teacher\\ntraining programs. Future work will focus on refining verbal skill annotations,\\nexpanding the dataset, and exploring additional features to enhance the\\nfeedback system.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T11:02:56Z\"}"}
