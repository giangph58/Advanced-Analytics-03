The BIOREME\\nnetwork hosts events, including this study group, to bring together\\nmulti-disciplinary researchers, clinicians, companies and charities to catalyse\\nresearch in the applications of mathematical modelling for respiratory\\nmedicine. The goal of this study group was to provide an interface between\\ncompanies, clinicians, and mathematicians to develop mathematical tools to the\\nproblems presented. The study group was held at The University of Glasgow on\\nthe 17 - 21 June 2024 and was attended by 16 participants from 8 different\\ninstitutions. Below details the technical report of one of the challenges and\\nthe methods developed by the team of researchers who worked on this challenge.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.med-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.med-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:32:01Z\"}"}
