Since they cannot form from the stellar evolution, their\\ncreation requires exotic mechanisms. One such mechanism involves the capture of\\ndark matter particles by stellar objects and their thermalization. When the\\ncriterion for the collapse of these dark matter particles is satisfied, a tiny\\nendoparasitic black hole (EBH) forms and then it accretes matter from the host.\\nThe EBH may transmute the host into a black hole of nearly the same mass as the\\nhost or lesser, depending on the type of accretion. We examine this complex and\\npoorly explored accretion mechanism, considering the effects of rotation and\\nviscosity but ignoring some other effects, such as those of pressure and\\nmagnetic field, as the first step. Using a general framework to assess the\\neffects of rotation and viscosity on accretion, we show that the accretion\\ncould be stalled in some white dwarfs, but not in neutron stars. The stalled\\naccretion should cause an opening in the host's polar regions, the extent of\\nwhich depends on the mass and spin of the host.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:52:25Z\"}"}
