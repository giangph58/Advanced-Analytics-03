{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20471v1\", \"title\": \"The Estimation of Continual Causal Effect for Dataset Shifting Streams\", \"summary\": \"Causal effect estimation has been widely used in marketing optimization. The\\nframework of an uplift model followed by a constrained optimization algorithm\\nis popular in practice. To enhance performance in the online environment, the\\nframework needs to be improved to address the complexities caused by temporal\\ndataset shift. This paper focuses on capturing the dataset shift from user\\nbehavior and domain distribution changing over time. We propose an Incremental\\nCausal Effect with Proxy Knowledge Distillation (ICE-PKD) framework to tackle\\nthis challenge. The ICE-PKD framework includes two components: (i) a\\nmulti-treatment uplift network that eliminates confounding bias using\\ncounterfactual regression; (ii) an incremental training strategy that adapts to\\nthe temporal dataset shift by updating with the latest data and protects\\ngeneralization via replay-based knowledge distillation. We also revisit the\\nuplift modeling metrics and introduce a novel metric for more precise online\\nevaluation in multiple treatment scenarios. Extensive experiments on both\\nsimulated and online datasets show that the proposed framework achieves better\\nperformance. The ICE-PKD framework has been deployed in the marketing system of\\nHuaxiaozhu, a ride-hailing platform in China.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T07:13:28Z\"}"}
