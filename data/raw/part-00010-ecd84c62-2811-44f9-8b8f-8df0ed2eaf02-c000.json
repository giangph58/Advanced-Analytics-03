{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11452v1\", \"title\": \"The universal profile of the invariant factors of $({\\\\mathbb\\n  Z}/n{\\\\mathbb Z})^\\\\times$\", \"summary\": \"The structure of the multiplicative group $M_n = ({\\\\mathbb Z}/n{\\\\mathbb\\nZ})^\\\\times$ encodes a great deal of arithmetic information about the integer\\n$n$ (examples include $\\\\phi(n)$, the Carmichael function $\\\\lambda(n)$, and the\\nnumber $\\\\omega(n)$ of distinct prime factors of $n$). We examine the invariant\\nfactor structure of $M_n$ for typical integers $n$, that is, the decomposition\\n$M_n \\\\cong {\\\\mathbb Z}/d_1{\\\\mathbb Z} \\\\times {\\\\mathbb Z}/d_2{\\\\mathbb Z} \\\\times\\n\\\\cdots \\\\times {\\\\mathbb Z}/d_k{\\\\mathbb Z}$ where $d_1\\\\mid d_2\\\\mid\\\\cdots\\\\mid\\nd_k$. We show that almost all integers have asymptotically the same invariant\\nfactors for all but the largest factors; for example, asymptotically $1/2$ of\\nthe invariant factors equal ${\\\\mathbb Z}/2{\\\\mathbb Z}$, asymptotically $1/4$ of\\nthem equal ${\\\\mathbb Z}/12{\\\\mathbb Z}$, asymptotically $1/12$ of them equal\\n${\\\\mathbb Z}/120{\\\\mathbb Z}$, and so on. Furthermore, for positive integers\\n$k$, we establish a theorem of Erd\\\\H{o}s-Kac type for the number of invariant\\nfactors of $M_n$ that equal ${\\\\mathbb Z}/k{\\\\mathbb Z}$, except that the\\ndistribution is not a normal distribution but rather a skew-normal or related\\ndistribution.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T17:58:31Z\"}"}
