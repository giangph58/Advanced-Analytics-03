As a main consequence of our main results, we solve\\nan open problem posed by Grigorchuk by showing that in an automaton group where\\na co-accessible state acts as the identity, any self-similar subgroup acting\\ntransitively on the first level, or any subgroup acting level-transitively on\\nthe rooted tree, is either cyclic or non-free. This result partially extends\\nSidki's findings for automaton groups with polynomial activity. Additionally,\\nwe show that for a reversible automaton group to generate a free group, the\\ndual must necessarily contain a bireversible connected component.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GR\", \"categories\": \"math.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T10:24:10Z\"}"}
