{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04191v1\", \"title\": \"Heisenberg Uncertainty Inequality and Breaking of Isospin Symmetry in\\n  Atomic Nuclei\", \"summary\": \"The Heisenberg uncertainty inequality is used to derive a rigorous lower\\nbound to the amount of isospin impurities, caused by the violation of isospin\\nsymmetry in $N=Z$ atomic nuclei, in terms of the difference between the neutron\\nand proton radii and the sum of the charge exchange monopole strengths. We show\\nthat the inequality reduces to an identity if one employs a simplified mean\\nfield expression for the isovector component of the Coulomb force in first\\norder perturbation theory. The uncertainty inequality is also employed to\\nderive an upper bound to the isovector dipole moment in terms of the amount of\\nisospin impurities, thereby providing an insightful connection between the\\nviolation of parity and isospin symmetries.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,hep-ex,hep-th,nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T07:40:43Z\"}"}
