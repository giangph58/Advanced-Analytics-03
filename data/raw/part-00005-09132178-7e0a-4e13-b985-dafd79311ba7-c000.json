We prove analogues of\\nthe discrete isoperimetric inequality (involving circumradius or inradius) for\\ncyclic and tangential polygons in hyperbolic geometry, considering both single\\nand multiple polygons. Furthermore, we establish two versions of the\\nisoperimetric inequality for multiple polygons in hyperbolic geometry with some\\nrestriction on their area or perimeter.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GT\", \"categories\": \"math.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:37:48Z\"}"}
