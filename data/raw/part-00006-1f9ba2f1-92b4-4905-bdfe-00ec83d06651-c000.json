Over the past\\ntwo decades, a common method for mapping stand borders has involved delineation\\nthrough manual interpretation of stereographic aerial images. This is a\\ntime-consuming and subjective process, limiting operational efficiency and\\nintroducing inconsistencies. Substantial effort has been devoted to automating\\nthe process, using various algorithms together with aerial images and canopy\\nheight models constructed from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, but manual\\ninterpretation remains the preferred method. Deep learning (DL) methods have\\ndemonstrated great potential in computer vision, yet their application to\\nforest stand delineation remains unexplored in published research. This study\\npresents a novel approach, framing stand delineation as a multiclass\\nsegmentation problem and applying a U-Net based DL framework. The model was\\ntrained and evaluated using multispectral images, ALS data, and an existing\\nstand map created by an expert interpreter. Performance was assessed on\\nindependent data using overall accuracy, a standard metric for classification\\ntasks that measures the proportions of correctly classified pixels. The model\\nachieved an overall accuracy of 0.73. These results demonstrate strong\\npotential for DL in automated stand delineation. However, a few key challenges\\nwere noted, especially for complex forest environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T10:47:25Z\"}"}
