The as-dewetted\\nnanoparticles tested in compression exhibited all features of dislocation\\nnucleation-controlled plasticity, including the size effect on strength and\\nultrahigh compressive strength reaching up to 11 GPa. Hydrogen cycling of\\nas-dewetted Pd nanoparticles resulted in their drastic softening and in change\\nof the deformation mode. This softening effect was correlated with the high\\ndensity of glissile dislocations observed in the cycled particles. This work\\ndemonstrates that the nanomechanical behavior of hydride-forming metals can be\\nmanipulated by hydrogen cycling.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T07:09:10Z\"}"}
