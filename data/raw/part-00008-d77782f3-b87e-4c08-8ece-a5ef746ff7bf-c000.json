This principle of\\ncognitive mapping is universal to agents with limited resources. Living\\norganisms, people, and algorithms all face the problem of forming functional\\nrepresentations of their world under various computing constraints. In this\\nwork, we explore the hypothesis that human resource-efficient planning may\\narise from representing the world as predictably structured. Building on the\\nmetaphor of concepts as programs, we propose that cognitive maps can take the\\nform of generative programs that exploit predictability and redundancy, in\\ncontrast to directly encoding spatial layouts. We use a behavioral experiment\\nto show that people who navigate in structured spaces rely on modular planning\\nstrategies that align with programmatic map representations. We describe a\\ncomputational model that predicts human behavior in a variety of structured\\nscenarios. This model infers a small distribution over possible programmatic\\ncognitive maps conditioned on human prior knowledge of the world, and uses this\\ndistribution to generate resource-efficient plans. Our models leverages a Large\\nLanguage Model as an embedding of human priors, implicitly learned through\\ntraining on a vast corpus of human data. Our model demonstrates improved\\ncomputational efficiency, requires drastically less memory, and outperforms\\nunstructured planning algorithms with cognitive constraints at predicting human\\nbehavior, suggesting that human planning strategies rely on programmatic\\ncognitive maps.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.ET\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T10:55:40Z\"}"}
