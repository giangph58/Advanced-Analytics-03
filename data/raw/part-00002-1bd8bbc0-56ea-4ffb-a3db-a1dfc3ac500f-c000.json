Sudakov factors arising from the\\nresummation of the double logarithms for the contributions of the transverse\\nmomenta of partons can increase the applicability of perturbative calculations.\\nIn this work we find that infrared contributions cannot be fully suppressed by\\nSudakov factors alone when the $B$ meson wave function obtained by solving the\\nwave equation in the QCD-inspired relativistic potential model is used in the\\ncalculation of $B$ decays. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce a soft\\ncutoff scale $\\\\mu_c$ to separate the hard and soft contributions. Color-octet\\ncontributions for the intermediate quark-antiquark pairs are considered. Such\\ncontributions are crucial to deminish the discrepancies between the theoretical\\ncalculation and experiemntal data. Using the isospin symmetry, we do find the\\noptimal parameter space for the nonperturbative inputs, which can result in\\nexcellent agreement between the theoretical calculation and experimental data\\nof $B\\\\to\\\\pi\\\\rho$ and $B\\\\to\\\\pi\\\\omega$ decays.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T03:09:23Z\"}"}
