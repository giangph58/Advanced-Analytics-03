In this work, we determine the short range magnetic order\\nand quantify the local magnetic anisotropy through total neutron scattering and\\npolarized neutron powder diffraction (pNPD) measurements on polycrystalline\\nMn3Si2Te6. The real space local and long range spin structure was determined\\nthrough the application of magnetic pair distribution function (mPDF) analysis,\\nwith measurements from the low temperature ordered phase to the high\\ntemperature paramagnetic state. Short-range order over a frustrated trimer of\\nthree nearest neighbors was found to exist well above the long range\\nferrimagnetic transition. pNPD measurements in the spin polarized paramagnetic\\nstate were used to extract the local site susceptibility tensor of the Mn ions\\nto quantify the magnetic anisotropy. Our combined mPDF and pNPD results provide\\nquantitative information on the short-range order intrinsic to Mn3Si2Te6,\\nshowing strong in-plane anisotropy with the spins largely confined to the\\nab-plane in zero field and remain stable with increasing temperature through\\nthe long-range to short-range ordered transition.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:44:14Z\"}"}
