{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00438v1\", \"title\": \"A Temporal Broadening-Aware Pulse Width Adaptation Scheme for ISI\\n  Mitigation and Energy Efficiency in THz Communication\", \"summary\": \"Terahertz (THz) communication ensures the provision of ultra-high data rates\\nowing to its abundant bandwidth; however, its performance is impeded by complex\\npropagation mechanisms. In particular, molecular absorption induces a temporal\\nbroadening effect (TBE), which causes pulse spreading and inter-symbol\\ninterference (ISI), especially in ON-OFF keying-based systems. To address this,\\nwe propose an adaptive pulse-width transmission scheme that dynamically adjusts\\npulse durations based on the anticipated TBE. This approach suppresses ISI by\\nconfining energy within symbol durations while also exploiting TBE\\nconstructively to reduce pulse transmissions in specific bit patterns, leading\\nto improved energy efficiency (EE) as an additional advantage of the proposed\\nscheme. Analytical derivations and simulation results confirm that the proposed\\nscheme substantially improves EE and bit error rate under practical THz channel\\nconditions.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T10:30:45Z\"}"}
