{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06217v1\", \"title\": \"Chernoff Information Bottleneck for Covert Quantum Target Sensing\", \"summary\": \"Target sensing is a fundamental task with many practical applications,\\ne.g.~in LiDaR and radar systems. Quantum strategies with entangled states can\\nachieve better sensing accuracies with the same probe energy, yet it is often\\nsimpler to use classical probes with higher energy than to take advantage of\\nthe quantum regime. Recently, it has been shown that useful quantum advantage\\ncan be achieved in covert situations, where sensing has to be performed while\\nalso avoiding detection by an adversary: here increasing energy is not a viable\\nstratagem, as it facilitates the adversary. In this paper we introduce a\\ngeneral framework to assess and quantify quantum advantage in covert\\nsituations. This is based on extending the information bottleneck principle,\\noriginally developed for communication and machine learning applications, to\\ndecision problems via the Chernoff information, with the ultimate goal of\\nquantitatively optimizing the trade-off between covertness and sensing ability.\\nIn this context we show how quantum resources, namely entangled photonic probes\\npaired with photon counting, greatly outperform classical coherent transmitters\\nin target detection and ranging, while also maintaining a chosen level of\\ncovertness. Our work highlights the great potential of integrating quantum\\nsensing in LiDAR systems to enhance the covert performance.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T17:05:41Z\"}"}
