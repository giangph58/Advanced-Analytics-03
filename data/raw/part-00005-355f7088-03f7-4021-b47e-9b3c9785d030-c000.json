{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09930v1\", \"title\": \"Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization With Mixed-categorical Design\\n  Variables for Expensive-to-evaluate Aeronautical Applications\", \"summary\": \"This work aims at developing new methodologies to optimize computational\\ncostly complex systems (e.g., aeronautical engineering systems). The proposed\\nsurrogate-based method (often called Bayesian optimization) uses adaptive\\nsampling to promote a trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Our\\nin-house implementation, called SEGOMOE, handles a high number of design\\nvariables (continuous, discrete or categorical) and nonlinearities by combining\\nmixtures of experts for the objective and/or the constraints. Additionally, the\\nmethod handles multi-objective optimization settings, as it allows the\\nconstruction of accurate Pareto fronts with a minimal number of function\\nevaluations. Different infill criteria have been implemented to handle multiple\\nobjectives with or without constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed\\nmethod was tested on practical aeronautical applications within the context of\\nthe European Project AGILE 4.0 and demonstrated favorable results. A first\\nexample concerns a retrofitting problem where a comparison between two\\noptimizers have been made. A second example introduces hierarchical variables\\nto deal with architecture system in order to design an aircraft family. The\\nthird example increases drastically the number of categorical variables as it\\ncombines aircraft design, supply chain and manufacturing process. In this\\narticle, we show, on three different realistic problems, various aspects of our\\noptimization codes thanks to the diversity of the treated aircraft problems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,math.OC,stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T06:44:13Z\"}"}
