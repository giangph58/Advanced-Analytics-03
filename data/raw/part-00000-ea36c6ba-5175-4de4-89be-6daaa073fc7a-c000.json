However, previous studies have primarily focused on single\\nlow-dose PET denoising, neglecting two critical factors: discrepancies in dose\\nresponse caused by inter-patient variability, and complementary anatomical\\nconstraints derived from CT images. In this work, we propose a novel CT-Guided\\nMulti-dose Adaptive Attention Denoising Diffusion Model (MDAA-Diff) for\\nmulti-dose PET denoising. Our approach integrates anatomical guidance and\\ndose-level adaptation to achieve superior denoising performance under low-dose\\nconditions. Specifically, this approach incorporates a CT-Guided High-frequency\\nWavelet Attention (HWA) module, which uses wavelet transforms to separate\\nhigh-frequency anatomical boundary features from CT images. These extracted\\nfeatures are then incorporated into PET imaging through an adaptive weighted\\nfusion mechanism to enhance edge details. Additionally, we propose the\\nDose-Adaptive Attention (DAA) module, a dose-conditioned enhancement mechanism\\nthat dynamically integrates dose levels into channel-spatial attention weight\\ncalculation. Extensive experiments on 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI datasets\\ndemonstrate that MDAA-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in\\npreserving diagnostic quality under reduced-dose conditions. Our code is\\npublicly available.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T10:27:12Z\"}"}
