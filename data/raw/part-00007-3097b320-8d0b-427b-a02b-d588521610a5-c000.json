{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19524v1\", \"title\": \"LR-IAD:Mask-Free Industrial Anomaly Detection with Logical Reasoning\", \"summary\": \"Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) is critical for ensuring product quality\\nby identifying defects. Traditional methods such as feature embedding and\\nreconstruction-based approaches require large datasets and struggle with\\nscalability. Existing vision-language models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large\\nLanguage Models (MLLMs) address some limitations but rely on mask annotations,\\nleading to high implementation costs and false positives. Additionally,\\nindustrial datasets like MVTec-AD and VisA suffer from severe class imbalance,\\nwith defect samples constituting only 23.8% and 11.1% of total data\\nrespectively. To address these challenges, we propose a reward function that\\ndynamically prioritizes rare defect patterns during training to handle class\\nimbalance. We also introduce a mask-free reasoning framework using Chain of\\nThought (CoT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) mechanisms,\\nenabling anomaly detection directly from raw images without annotated masks.\\nThis approach generates interpretable step-by-step explanations for defect\\nlocalization. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming\\nprior approaches by 36% in accuracy on MVTec-AD and 16% on VisA. By eliminating\\nmask dependency and reducing costs while providing explainable outputs, this\\nwork advances industrial anomaly detection and supports scalable quality\\ncontrol in manufacturing. Code to reproduce the experiment is available at\\nhttps://github.com/LilaKen/LR-IAD.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T06:52:35Z\"}"}
