Already at first\\norder in perturbation theory, the dimension of certain single-cycle operators\\nis corrected, indicating that wrapping corrections from integrability must come\\ninto play earlier than expected. We also discuss a flaw in the original\\nderivation of the integrable structure of the perturbed orbifold. Together,\\nthese observations suggest that more needs to be done to correctly identify and\\nexploit the integrable structure of the perturbed orbifold CFT.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T16:58:34Z\"}"}
