{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02270v1\", \"title\": \"MinkOcc: Towards real-time label-efficient semantic occupancy prediction\", \"summary\": \"Developing 3D semantic occupancy prediction models often relies on dense 3D\\nannotations for supervised learning, a process that is both labor and\\nresource-intensive, underscoring the need for label-efficient or even\\nlabel-free approaches. To address this, we introduce MinkOcc, a multi-modal 3D\\nsemantic occupancy prediction framework for cameras and LiDARs that proposes a\\ntwo-step semi-supervised training procedure. Here, a small dataset of\\nexplicitly 3D annotations warm-starts the training process; then, the\\nsupervision is continued by simpler-to-annotate accumulated LiDAR sweeps and\\nimages -- semantically labelled through vision foundational models. MinkOcc\\neffectively utilizes these sensor-rich supervisory cues and reduces reliance on\\nmanual labeling by 90\\\\% while maintaining competitive accuracy. In addition,\\nthe proposed model incorporates information from LiDAR and camera data through\\nearly fusion and leverages sparse convolution networks for real-time\\nprediction. With its efficiency in both supervision and computation, we aim to\\nextend MinkOcc beyond curated datasets, enabling broader real-world deployment\\nof 3D semantic occupancy prediction in autonomous driving.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T04:31:56Z\"}"}
