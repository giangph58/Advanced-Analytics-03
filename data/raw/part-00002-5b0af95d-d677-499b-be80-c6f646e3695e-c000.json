Pavement surface profiles are obtained from 3D digital\\nsurface models created with Close-Range Orthogonal Photogrammetry. To\\ncharacterize the roughness features of analyzed profiles, selected texture\\nparameters were calculated from the profile's geometry. The parameters values\\nwere compared to the frictional performance obtained by numerical simulations.\\nContact simulations are performed according to a dedicated finite element\\nscheme where surface roughness is directly embedded into a special class of\\ninterface finite elements. Simulations were performed for different case\\nscenarios and the obtained results showed a notable trend between roughness\\ndescriptors and friction performance, indicating a promising potential for this\\nnumerical method to be consistently employed to predict the frictional\\nproperties of actual pavement surface profiles.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CE\", \"categories\": \"cs.CE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:58:31Z\"}"}
