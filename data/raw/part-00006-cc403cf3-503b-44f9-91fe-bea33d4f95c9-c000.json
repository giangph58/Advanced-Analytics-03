This study aims to design viscoelastic composite\\nmicrostructures that achieve both low acoustic reflection and high internal\\ndamping by simultaneously optimizing their effective acoustic impedance and\\nattenuation characteristics. Using homogenization theory and density-based\\ntopology optimization, viscoelastic and impedance-matching materials are\\ndistributed within a unit cell to manipulate these properties. Numerical\\nresults show that optimized microstructures with viscoelastic lattice embedded\\nin impedance-matching material outperform pure viscoelastic materials in\\nattenuation while maintaining low reflection. This demonstrates the potential\\nof microstructural engineering for effective low-frequency noise mitigation.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:10:31Z\"}"}
