Unlike previous\\napproaches, our method does not rely on code concatenation and instead arises\\nas the solution to a coloring game on a square grid. Under a uniform\\ncircuit-level noise model, we observe a threshold of approximately $0.3\\\\%$ when\\ndecoding with minimum weight perfect matching, and we conjecture that this\\ncould be improved using a more tailored decoder.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T16:36:03Z\"}"}
