In the case of toric\\nLagrangians contained in a toric component of the degeneration, an invariance\\nargument implies the existence of projective Maurer-Cartan solutions, which\\ngives an alternate proof of the unobstructedness result of Fukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono\\nfor toric manifolds. Our result also proves unobstructedness in more general\\ncases, such as for toric Lagrangians in almost toric four-manifolds.\", \"main_category\": \"math.SG\", \"categories\": \"math.SG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T04:56:17Z\"}"}
