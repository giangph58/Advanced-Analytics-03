{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07561v1\", \"title\": \"Regular Black Hole Models in the Transition from Baryonic Matter to\\n  Quark Matter\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we investigate gravitational collapse scenarios involving\\nbaryonic matter transitioning into quark-gluon plasma under extreme\\nastrophysical conditions, focusing on their implications for the formation of\\nregular black holes. Standard gravitational collapse models inevitably predict\\ncentral singularities, highlighting the limitations of classical general\\nrelativity in extreme density regimes. By introducing a physically motivated,\\ninhomogeneous transition rate between baryonic and quark matter, we demonstrate\\nanalytically and numerically that it is possible to construct regular black\\nhole solutions featuring a nonsingular de Sitter-like core. We further analyze\\nthe observable consequences of these models, particularly emphasizing\\nmodifications to the black hole shadow radius, which provide direct\\nobservational constraints accessible through Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)\\nmeasurements.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T08:46:40Z\"}"}
