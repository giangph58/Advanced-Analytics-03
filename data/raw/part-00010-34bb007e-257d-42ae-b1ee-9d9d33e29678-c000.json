We analyze the origin of this event under three scenarios, viz., a\\ntransient point source, a diffuse astrophysical emission, and line-of-sight\\ninteraction of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECR; $E \\\\gtrsim 0.1$~EeV). Our\\nanalysis includes the flux from both a KM3NeT-only fit and a joint fit,\\nincorporating data from KM3NeT, IceCube, and Pierre Auger Observatory. If the\\nneutrino event originates from transients, it requires a new population of\\ntransient that is energetic, gamma-ray dark, and more abundant than known ones.\\nIn the framework of diffuse astrophysical emission, we compare the required\\nlocal UHECR energy injection rate at $\\\\gtrsim4$ EeV, assuming a proton primary,\\nwith the rate derived from the flux measurements by Auger. This disfavors the\\nKM3NeT-only fit at all redshifts, while the joint fit remains viable for\\n$z\\\\gtrsim 1$, based on redshift evolution models of known source populations.\\nFor cosmogenic origin from point sources, our results suggest that the\\nluminosity obtained at redshifts $z \\\\lesssim 1$ from the joint fit is\\ncompatible with the Eddington luminosity of supermassive black holes in active\\ngalactic nuclei.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T04:07:13Z\"}"}
