The space $\\\\mathcal S$ can\\nbe identified with a quotient of the space of stability conditions on the\\nCY$_3$ category associated to $Q$. The space $\\\\mathcal L$ has a canonical map\\nto the complex cluster Poisson space $\\\\mathcal X_{\\\\mathbb C}$ which we prove to\\nbe a local homeomorphism. When $Q$ is of type $A$, we give a geometric\\ndescription of the spaces $\\\\mathcal S$ and $\\\\mathcal L$ as moduli spaces of\\nmeromorphic quadratic differentials and projective structures respectively. In\\nthe sequel paper we will introduce a space $Z\\\\to \\\\mathbb C$ whose fibre over\\nover a point $\\\\epsilon\\\\in \\\\mathbb C$ is isomorphic to $\\\\mathcal S$ when\\n$\\\\epsilon=0$ and to $\\\\mathcal L$ otherwise. The problem of constructing\\nsections of this map gives a geometric approach to the Riemann-Hilbert problems\\ndefined by the Donaldson-Thomas invariants.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG,math.RT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T11:17:45Z\"}"}
