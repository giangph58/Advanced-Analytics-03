{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14862v1\", \"title\": \"FERMI: Flexible Radio Mapping with a Hybrid Propagation Model and\\n  Scalable Autonomous Data Collection\", \"summary\": \"Communication is fundamental for multi-robot collaboration, with accurate\\nradio mapping playing a crucial role in predicting signal strength between\\nrobots. However, modeling radio signal propagation in large and occluded\\nenvironments is challenging due to complex interactions between signals and\\nobstacles. Existing methods face two key limitations: they struggle to predict\\nsignal strength for transmitter-receiver pairs not present in the training set,\\nwhile also requiring extensive manual data collection for modeling, making them\\nimpractical for large, obstacle-rich scenarios. To overcome these limitations,\\nwe propose FERMI, a flexible radio mapping framework. FERMI combines\\nphysics-based modeling of direct signal paths with a neural network to capture\\nenvironmental interactions with radio signals. This hybrid model learns radio\\nsignal propagation more efficiently, requiring only sparse training data.\\nAdditionally, FERMI introduces a scalable planning method for autonomous data\\ncollection using a multi-robot team. By increasing parallelism in data\\ncollection and minimizing robot travel costs between regions, overall data\\ncollection efficiency is significantly improved. Experiments in both simulation\\nand real-world scenarios demonstrate that FERMI enables accurate signal\\nprediction and generalizes well to unseen positions in complex environments. It\\nalso supports fully autonomous data collection and scales to different team\\nsizes, offering a flexible solution for creating radio maps.
