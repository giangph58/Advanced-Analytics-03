Our generalized\\nsolution can reproduce the ADAF, SLE, SSD, and slim disc branches in a wide\\nrange of accretion rates from sub- to super-Eddington accretion. An S-curve in\\nthe $\\\\dot{m}-\\\\Sigma$ plane is also reproduced, representing the SSD branch, the\\nradiation-pressure-dominant branch, and the slim disc branch. The solution\\ngives a natural transition between SSD and slim disc when photon trapping\\noccurs in the accretion flow, producing a radially hybrid SSD-slim disc\\nstructure in a certain range of accretion rates. The coexistence of ADAF and\\nSSD below a critical accretion rate is clearly shown with distinct advection\\nfraction of accretion energy. We also present the luminosity, radiation\\nefficiency, and spectrum from the generalized solutions for a large range of\\naccretion rates in stellar mass black holes.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T14:43:41Z\"}"}
