We focus on the Deep Ritz\\nMethod as it is of practical interest and sensitive to integration errors. We\\nshow how both deterministic integration rules as well as biased, stochastic\\nquadrature can lead to erroneous results, whilst high order, unbiased\\nstochastic quadrature rules on integration meshes can significantly improve\\nconvergence at an equivalent computational cost. Furthermore, we propose novel\\nstochastic quadrature rules for triangular and tetrahedral elements, offering\\ngreater flexibility when designing integration meshes in more complex\\ngeometries. We highlight how the variance in the stochastic gradient limits\\nconvergence, whilst quadrature rules designed to give similar errors when\\nintegrating the loss function may lead to disparate results when employed in a\\ngradient-based optimiser.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T11:15:38Z\"}"}
