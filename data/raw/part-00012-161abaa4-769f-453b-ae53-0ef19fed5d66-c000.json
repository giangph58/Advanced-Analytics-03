We\\ndefine Widom factors of compact subsets $K\\\\subset \\\\mathbb C^n$ associated with\\nmultivariate orthogonal polynomials and weighted Chebyshev polynomials. We show\\nthat on product subsets $K=K_1\\\\times\\\\cdots\\\\times K_n$ of $\\\\mathbb C^n$, where\\neach $K_j$ is a non-polar compact subset of $\\\\mathbb C$, these quantities have\\nuniversal lower bounds which directly extend one dimensional results. Under the\\nadditional assumption that each $K_j$ is a subset of the real line, we provide\\nimproved lower bounds for Widom factors for some weight functions $w$; in\\nparticular, for the case $w\\\\equiv 1$. Finally, we define the Mahler measure of\\na multivariate polynomial relative to $K\\\\subset \\\\mathbb C^n$ and obtain lower\\nbounds for this quantity on product sets.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CV\", \"categories\": \"math.CV,math.CA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T16:42:20Z\"}"}
