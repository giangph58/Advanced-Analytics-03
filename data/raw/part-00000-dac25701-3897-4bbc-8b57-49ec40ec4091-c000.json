However, a profound understanding and application of such\\nmaterials depends on the accurate detection of their electronic and magnetic\\nproperties. Despite the availability of experimental techniques that can sense\\nthe magnetic signal, the exact determination of the spin ground states and\\nspatial distribution of exchange interaction of strongly correlated\\nsingle-molecule magnets remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate that scanning\\nprobe microscopy with a nickelocene-functionalized probe can distinguish\\nbetween nearly degenerate multireference ground states of single-molecule\\n{\\\\pi}-magnets and map their spatial distribution of the exchange interaction.\\nThis method expands the already outstanding imaging capabilities of scanning\\nprobe microscopy for characterizing the chemical and electronic structures of\\nindividual molecules, paving the way for the study of strongly correlated\\nmolecular magnets with unprecedented spatial resolution.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:07:03Z\"}"}
