{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02550v1\", \"title\": \"Enhanced Permeability Estimation in Microporous Rocks Using a Hybrid\\n  Macropore-Darcy Approach\", \"summary\": \"This study presents a novel workflow for constructing hybrid macropore-Darcy\\nmodels from micro-CT images of microporous rocks. In our approach, macropore\\nnetworks are extracted using established methods, while the microporosity is\\ncharacterised through segmented phase classification and incorporated into the\\nmodel as Darcy cells. Effectively, Darcy cells capture the micro scale\\nconnectivity variations that are missing in the macroscopic networks. This dual\\nentity model thus incorporates both the conventional macroscopic pore structure\\nand the critical flow pathways present in the under-resolved microporous\\nregions. The proposed workflow is rigorously validated by comparing the\\npermeability estimates with direct numerical simulation (DNS) results and\\nexperimental measurements. Our findings demonstrate that this hybrid approach\\nreliably reproduces fluid flow behaviour in complex porous media while\\nsignificantly reducing computational demands, offering a promising tool for\\nadvanced groundwater modelling and water resource management.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T13:05:31Z\"}"}
