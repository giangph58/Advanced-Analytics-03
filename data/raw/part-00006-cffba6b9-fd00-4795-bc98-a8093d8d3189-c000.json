{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11811v1\", \"title\": \"Manifold meta-learning for reduced-complexity neural system\\n  identification\", \"summary\": \"System identification has greatly benefited from deep learning techniques,\\nparticularly for modeling complex, nonlinear dynamical systems with partially\\nunknown physics where traditional approaches may not be feasible. However, deep\\nlearning models often require large datasets and significant computational\\nresources at training and inference due to their high-dimensional\\nparameterizations. To address this challenge, we propose a meta-learning\\nframework that discovers a low-dimensional manifold within the parameter space\\nof an over-parameterized neural network architecture. This manifold is learned\\nfrom a meta-dataset of input-output sequences generated by a class of related\\ndynamical systems, enabling efficient model training while preserving the\\nnetwork's expressive power for the considered system class. Unlike bilevel\\nmeta-learning approaches, our method employs an auxiliary neural network to map\\ndatasets directly onto the learned manifold, eliminating the need for costly\\nsecond-order gradient computations during meta-training and reducing the number\\nof first-order updates required in inference, which could be expensive for\\nlarge models. We validate our approach on a family of Bouc-Wen oscillators,\\nwhich is a well-studied nonlinear system identification benchmark. We\\ndemonstrate that we are able to learn accurate models even in small-data\\nscenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T06:49:56Z\"}"}
