In\\nparticular, for sequences $S$ in a cyclic group, we establish a direct\\nconnection between $MZ(S)$, the length of the shortest nonempty subsequence\\nsumming to zero and the number of distinct values in $S$. Our results reveal\\nthat sequences with larger support must contain shorter non-empty zero-sum\\nsubsequences, in line with classical zero-sum results. Additionally, we present\\none application of our main result to a factorization of ideals problem in\\nrings of integers of a number field.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT,math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T07:36:29Z\"}"}
