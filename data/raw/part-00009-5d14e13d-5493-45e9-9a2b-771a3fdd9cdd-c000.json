Two formulas are\\nproposed, both derived from characterizations of the block FOM residual. The\\nfirst formula employs a block generalization of the residual polynomial, while\\nthe second leverages the block collinearity of the residuals. A posteriori\\nerror bounds based on the knowledge of spectral information of the argument are\\nderived and tested on a set of examples. Notably, both error formulas and their\\ncorresponding upper bounds do not require the use of quadratures for their\\npractical evaluation.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:56:55Z\"}"}
