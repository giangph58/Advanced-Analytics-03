{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05231v1\", \"title\": \"Adaptive Biased User Scheduling for Heterogeneous Wireless Federate\\n  Learning Network\", \"summary\": \"Federated Learning (FL) has revolutionized collaborative model training in\\ndistributed networks, prioritizing data privacy and communication efficiency.\\nThis paper investigates efficient deployment of FL in wireless heterogeneous\\nnetworks, focusing on strategies to accelerate convergence despite stragglers.\\nThe primary objective is to minimize long-term convergence wall-clock time\\nthrough optimized user scheduling and resource allocation. While stragglers may\\nintroduce delays in a single round, their inclusion can expedite subsequent\\nrounds, particularly when they possess critical information. Moreover,\\nbalancing single-round duration with the number of cumulative rounds,\\ncompounded by dynamic training and transmission conditions, necessitates a\\nnovel approach beyond conventional optimization solutions. To tackle these\\nchallenges, convergence analysis with respect to adaptive and biased scheduling\\nis derived. Then, by factoring in real-time system and statistical information,\\nincluding diverse energy constraints and users' energy harvesting capabilities,\\na deep reinforcement learning approach, empowered by proximal policy\\noptimization, is employed to adaptively select user sets. For the scheduled\\nusers, Lagrangian decomposition is applied to optimize local resource\\nutilization, further enhancing system efficiency. Simulation results validate\\nthe effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework for various FL\\ntasks, demonstrating reduced task time compared to existing benchmarks under\\nvarious settings.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:26:09Z\"}"}
