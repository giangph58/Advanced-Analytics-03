The latter method offers numerous opportunities in terms of\\nintegration and performance compared to conventional optical reading. Here, we\\ninvestigate the physical properties of a graphitic-diamond-graphitic structure\\nunder illumination. We show how, for a type IIa diamond material, electron-hole\\npairs generated by an ensemble of NV centers lead to a p-type material upon\\nillumination, making this all-carbon structure equivalent to two back-to-back\\nSchottky diodes. We analyze how the reverse current flowing upon illumination\\nchanges as a function of bias voltage and radiofrequency-induced excitation of\\nthe NV ensemble spin resonances. Furthermore, we demonstrate how an additional\\nfield effect arising from the illumination scheme affects the reverse current,\\nresulting in a photoelectrical signal that can exceed the optical signal under\\nthe same illumination conditions.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T13:48:49Z\"}"}
