Employing\\nmother fixed-effects, difference-in-differences, and shift-share\\ninstrumental-variables designs, we find that vaccination improves health and\\neconomic outcomes for at least two subsequent generations. Causal mediation\\nanalysis reveals that these benefits arise from improved health behaviors and\\nepigenetic factors. Even in milder disease environments as seen today,\\nvaccination delivers lasting advantages, demonstrating its long-term benefits\\nbeyond epidemic contexts. These findings highlight the benefits of early-life\\nhealth interventions lasting for subsequent generations.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T12:37:09Z\"}"}
