{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10203v1\", \"title\": \"A moving horizon estimator for aquifer thermal energy storages\", \"summary\": \"Aquifer thermal energy storages (ATES) represent groundwater saturated\\naquifers that store thermal energy in the form of heated or cooled groundwater.\\nCombining two ATES, one can harness excess thermal energy from summer (heat)\\nand winter (cold) to support the building's heating, ventilation, and air\\nconditioning (HVAC) technology. In general, a dynamic operation of ATES\\nthroughout the year is beneficial to avoid using fossil fuel-based HVAC\\ntechnology and maximize the ``green use'' of ATES. Model predictive control\\n(MPC) with an appropriate system model may become a crucial control approach\\nfor ATES systems. Consequently, the MPC model should reflect spatial\\ntemperature profiles around ATES' boreholes to predict extracted groundwater\\ntemperatures accurately. However, meaningful predictions require the estimation\\nof the current state of the system, as measurements are usually only at the\\nborehole of the ATES. In control, this is often realized by model-based\\nobservers. Still, observing the state of an ATES system is non-trivial, since\\nthe model is typically hybrid. We show how to exploit the specific structure of\\nthe hybrid ATES model and design an easy-to-solve moving horizon estimator\\nbased on a quadratic program.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T13:11:34Z\"}"}
