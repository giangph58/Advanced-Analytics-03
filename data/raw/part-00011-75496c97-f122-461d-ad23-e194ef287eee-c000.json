The first\\nparameter is the maximal number of leaves attached to a vertex. The second\\nparameter is the size of the largest set of vertices sharing the same closed\\nneighborhood minus $1$.\\n  Apparently, this is the first example of a natural, non-trivial\\nequidistribution of graph parameters on unlabeled connected graphs on a fixed\\nset of vertices.\\n  Our proof is enumerative, using the theory of species. Exhibiting an explicit\\nbijection interchanging the two parameters remains an open problem.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T16:06:37Z\"}"}
