However, $S_3$, the smallest modular group,\\nremains relatively underexplored. In this work, we construct the minimal\\nsupersymmetric inverse seesaw model based on the modular $S_3$ flavor symmetry.\\nIn our model, the light neutrino mass matrix depends on 6 real parameters: the\\ncomplex modulus, an overall scale for light neutrino mass, a real ratio and a\\ncomplex ratio of Yukawa coupling. Thanks to its minimality, our model offers\\nvarious definite predictions: the lightest neutrino is massless, the neutrino\\nmasses are inverted ordering, the sum of the three light neutrino masses\\n($\\\\sum_i m_i$) is 100 meV, the effective mass for the end point of the beta\\ndecay spectrum is 50 meV, the effective mass for neutrinoless double beta decay\\n($m_{ee}$) is in the range $38-58$ meV. In particular, the predicted values for\\n$\\\\sum_i m_i$ and $m_{ee}$ from our model are within reach of the next\\ngeneration experiments. Our model also predicts radiative lepton flavor\\nviolating decays $\\\\ell\\\\to\\\\ell'\\\\gamma$ which are compatible with experimental\\nconstraints.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T13:58:43Z\"}"}
