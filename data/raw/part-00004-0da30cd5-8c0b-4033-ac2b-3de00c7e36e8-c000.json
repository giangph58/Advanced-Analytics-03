{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21340v1\", \"title\": \"Towards Improved Cervical Cancer Screening: Vision Transformer-Based\\n  Classification and Interpretability\", \"summary\": \"We propose a novel approach to cervical cell image classification for\\ncervical cancer screening using the EVA-02 transformer model. We developed a\\nfour-step pipeline: fine-tuning EVA-02, feature extraction, selecting important\\nfeatures through multiple machine learning models, and training a new\\nartificial neural network with optional loss weighting for improved\\ngeneralization. With this design, our best model achieved an F1-score of\\n0.85227, outperforming the baseline EVA-02 model (0.84878). We also utilized\\nKernel SHAP analysis and identified key features correlating with cell\\nmorphology and staining characteristics, providing interpretable insights into\\nthe decision-making process of the fine-tuned model. Our code is available at\\nhttps://github.com/Khoa-NT/isbi2025_ps3c.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T05:59:56Z\"}"}
