One of the prominent issues concerning the\\nsuperconductivity mechanism is about the pseudogap phase which behaves either\\nas cooperator or competitor for superconductivity and its fundamental reason\\nremains still elusive. Here we report the measurements of scanning tunneling\\nmicroscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) in the model superconducting system\\nBi2+xSr2-xCuO6+delta with a transition temperature Tc~7 K. Although this system\\nis supposed to be slightly overdoped, a pseudogap feature can be easily\\nobserved in the energy region of about 20-60 meV. A modulation of local density\\nof states (LDOS) with a periodicity of about 4a0/3 (a0: Cu-O-Cu bond length)\\ncan be easily observed, which is also supported by the Fourier transformation\\npattern with wavevectors at about (0,+-3pi/2a0) and (+-3pi/2a0,0).\\nSurprisingly, we find that the LDOS exhibits a clear antiphase feature in the\\npseudogap energy region below and above the Fermi energy, indicating that it is\\nan intrinsic feature of the pseudogap phase. We interpret this modulation and\\nantiphase feature as a possible consequence of the pair density wave due to the\\nAmperean pairing with finite momentum. Our results give a deep insight on the\\nunderstanding of the pseudogap phase in cuprate superconductors.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:53:54Z\"}"}
