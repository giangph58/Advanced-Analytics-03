Focusing on open-water swim\\ndraftingwhere athletes reduce drag most effectively by swimming directly behind\\npeerswe estimate its performance effects through a structural contest framework\\nwith endogenous, deterministic effort and drafting position. Leveraging\\nexogenous variation from COVID-19 drafting bans in Austrian triathlons, we\\napply a panel leave-one-out (LOO/LOTO) peer ability instrumental variables (IV)\\nstrategy to isolate the causal non-linear effect of drafting. Results from\\nrestricted sample analysis and pooled estimated bandwagon IV effects show\\nsubstantial and nonlinear gains: in small (group size below 10) drafting swim\\ngroups/clusters, each deeper position improves finishing rank on average by\\nover 30%, with rapidly diminishing returns in larger groups.
