In contrast, we propose a data-driven multi-view\\nreasoning approach that directly infers 3D scene geometry and camera poses from\\nmulti-view images. Our framework, DiffusionSfM, parameterizes scene geometry\\nand cameras as pixel-wise ray origins and endpoints in a global frame and\\nemploys a transformer-based denoising diffusion model to predict them from\\nmulti-view inputs. To address practical challenges in training diffusion models\\nwith missing data and unbounded scene coordinates, we introduce specialized\\nmechanisms that ensure robust learning. We empirically validate DiffusionSfM on\\nboth synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms classical\\nand learning-based approaches while naturally modeling uncertainty.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T17:59:47Z\"}"}
