We propose \\\\IMPC, a novel framework that\\naddresses this gap by integrating real-time human instructions through a Large\\nLanguage Model~(LLM) to produce context-aware predictions for MPC. Our method\\nemploys a Language-to-Distribution~(L2D) module to translate contextual\\ninformation into predictive disturbance trajectories, which are then\\nincorporated into the MPC optimization. Unlike existing context-aware and\\nlanguage-based MPC models, \\\\IMPC enables dynamic human-LLM interaction and\\nfine-tunes the L2D module in a closed loop with theoretical performance\\nguarantees, achieving a regret bound of $O(\\\\sqrt{T\\\\log T})$ for linear dynamics\\nwhen optimized via advanced fine-tuning methods such as Direct Preference\\nOptimization~(DPO) using a tailored loss function.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T11:59:00Z\"}"}
