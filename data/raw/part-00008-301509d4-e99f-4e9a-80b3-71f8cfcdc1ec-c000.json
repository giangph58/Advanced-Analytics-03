To this end we first derive a self-consistent relation between the\\n$d-\\\\epsilon$ scaling exponents and the associated $d$ dimensional beta\\nfunctions. We then demonstrate that to account for an interacting fixed point\\nin the original theory the related $d-\\\\epsilon$ scaling exponent must be\\nmulti-valued in $\\\\epsilon$. We elucidate our findings by discussing several\\nexamples such as the QCD Banks-Zaks infrared fixed point, QCD at large number\\nof flavors, as well as the O(N) model in four dimensions. For the latter, we\\nshow that although the $1/N$ corrections prevent the reconstruction of the\\nrenormalization group flow, this is possible when adding the $1/N^2$\\ncontributions.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:50:27Z\"}"}
