{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03474v1\", \"title\": \"Classification of LEO Satellites Using Occultations of Background Stars\", \"summary\": \"We present the result of a proof-of-concept simulation designed to classify\\nLEO satellites based on their occultations of background stars. We generate\\nsatellite shapes drawn from two broad shape classes, 'boxwing' and 'square'. We\\nthen simulate the resulting occultation photometry that would be caused by\\nthese satellites orbiting in LEO and intersecting with background stars. The\\nresulting data is then inverted to attempt to recover the input shape and\\nclassify the satellite correctly. We find that the technique is theoretically\\nsound, but ambitious with current telescope capabilities. We construct an\\nequation for the required success rate of the method, as a function of exposure\\ntime and density of background stars. We find that successful classification\\nrequires short exposure times and high background stellar densities. For\\nsuccess rates in excess of 75%, we find a required exposure time of\\n$\\\\sim2.0\\\\times10^{-3}$s, and $\\\\sim500$ stars along the satellites path. Results\\nare presented in terms of these two key parameters, and are discussed in the\\ncontext of current observational capabilities and alternative satellite\\ncharacterisation methods.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T12:26:10Z\"}"}
