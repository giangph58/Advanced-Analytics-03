{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10060v1\", \"title\": \"Learning to Beamform for Cooperative Localization and Communication: A\\n  Link Heterogeneous GNN-Based Approach\", \"summary\": \"Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a key enabler for\\nnext-generation wireless networks, supporting advanced applications such as\\nhigh-precision localization and environment reconstruction. Cooperative ISAC\\n(CoISAC) further enhances these capabilities by enabling multiple base stations\\n(BSs) to jointly optimize communication and sensing performance through\\ncoordination. However, CoISAC beamforming design faces significant challenges\\ndue to system heterogeneity, large-scale problem complexity, and sensitivity to\\nparameter estimation errors. Traditional deep learning-based techniques fail to\\nexploit the unique structural characteristics of CoISAC systems, thereby\\nlimiting their ability to enhance system performance. To address these\\nchallenges, we propose a Link-Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (LHGNN) for\\njoint beamforming in CoISAC systems. Unlike conventional approaches, LHGNN\\nmodels communication and sensing links as heterogeneous nodes and their\\ninteractions as edges, enabling the capture of the heterogeneous nature and\\nintricate interactions of CoISAC systems. Furthermore, a graph attention\\nmechanism is incorporated to dynamically adjust node and link importance,\\nimproving robustness to channel and position estimation errors. Numerical\\nresults demonstrate that the proposed attention-enhanced LHGNN achieves\\nsuperior communication rates while maintaining sensing accuracy under power\\nconstraints. The proposed method also exhibits strong robustness to\\ncommunication channel and position estimation error.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T10:03:12Z\"}"}
