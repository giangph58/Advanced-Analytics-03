{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17701v1\", \"title\": \"Network Sampling: An Overview and Comparative Analysis\", \"summary\": \"Network sampling is a crucial technique for analyzing large or partially\\nobservable networks. However, the effectiveness of different sampling methods\\ncan vary significantly depending on the context. In this study, we empirically\\ncompare representative methods from three main categories: node-based,\\nedge-based, and exploration-based sampling. We used two real-world datasets for\\nour analysis: a scientific collaboration network and a temporal message-sending\\nnetwork. Our results indicate that no single sampling method consistently\\noutperforms the others in both datasets. Although advanced methods tend to\\nprovide better accuracy on static networks, they often perform poorly on\\ntemporal networks, where simpler techniques can be more effective. These\\nfindings suggest that the best sampling strategy depends not only on the\\nstructural characteristics of the network but also on the specific metrics that\\nneed to be preserved or analyzed. Our work offers practical insights for\\nresearchers in choosing sampling approaches that are tailored to different\\ntypes of networks and analytical objectives.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SI\", \"categories\": \"cs.SI,cond-mat.stat-mech,physics.data-an\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T16:10:06Z\"}"}
