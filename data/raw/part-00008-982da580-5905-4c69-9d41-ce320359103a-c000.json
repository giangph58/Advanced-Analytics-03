{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21454v1\", \"title\": \"SimPRIVE: a Simulation framework for Physical Robot Interaction with\\n  Virtual Environments\", \"summary\": \"The use of machine learning in cyber-physical systems has attracted the\\ninterest of both industry and academia. However, no general solution has yet\\nbeen found against the unpredictable behavior of neural networks and\\nreinforcement learning agents. Nevertheless, the improvements of\\nphoto-realistic simulators have paved the way towards extensive testing of\\ncomplex algorithms in different virtual scenarios, which would be expensive and\\ndangerous to implement in the real world.\\n  This paper presents SimPRIVE, a simulation framework for physical robot\\ninteraction with virtual environments, which operates as a vehicle-in-the-loop\\nplatform, rendering a virtual world while operating the vehicle in the real\\nworld.\\n  Using SimPRIVE, any physical mobile robot running on ROS 2 can easily be\\nconfigured to move its digital twin in a virtual world built with the Unreal\\nEngine 5 graphic engine, which can be populated with objects, people, or other\\nvehicles with programmable behavior.\\n  SimPRIVE has been designed to accommodate custom or pre-built virtual worlds\\nwhile being light-weight to contain execution times and allow fast rendering.\\nIts main advantage lies in the possibility of testing complex algorithms on the\\nfull software and hardware stack while minimizing the risks and costs of a test\\ncampaign. The framework has been validated by testing a reinforcement learning\\nagent trained for obstacle avoidance on an AgileX Scout Mini rover that\\nnavigates a virtual office environment where everyday objects and people are\\nplaced as obstacles. The physical rover moves with no collision in an indoor\\nlimited space, thanks to a LiDAR-based heuristic.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T09:22:55Z\"}"}
