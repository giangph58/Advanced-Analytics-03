Although diffusion models have demonstrated potential in effectively\\nhandling incomplete data, most existing methods in this field focus on the\\nimage do-main and lack global constraints, which consequently leads to\\ninsufficient reconstruction quality. In this study, we propose a dual-domain\\nvirtual-mask in-formed diffusion model for sparse-view reconstruction by\\nleveraging the high inter-channel correlation in DECT. Specifically, the study\\ndesigns a virtual mask and applies it to the high-energy and low-energy data to\\nperform perturbation operations, thus constructing high-dimensional tensors\\nthat serve as the prior information of the diffusion model. In addition, a\\ndual-domain collaboration strategy is adopted to integrate the information of\\nthe randomly selected high-frequency components in the wavelet domain with the\\ninformation in the projection domain, for the purpose of optimizing the global\\nstruc-tures and local details. Experimental results indicated that the present\\nmethod exhibits excellent performance across multiple datasets.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T13:54:26Z\"}"}
