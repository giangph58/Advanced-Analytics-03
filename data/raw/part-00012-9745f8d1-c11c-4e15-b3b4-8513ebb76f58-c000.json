We use\\ncomputer algebra to constrain a Gaussian Process on solutions of ODEs. We\\nobtain control functions via conditioning on datapoints. Our approach thereby\\nconnects Algebra, Functional Analysis, Machine Learning and Control theory. We\\ndiscuss the optimality of the control functions generated by the posterior mean\\nof the Gaussian Process. We present numerical examples which underline the\\npracticability of our approach.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T09:17:45Z\"}"}
