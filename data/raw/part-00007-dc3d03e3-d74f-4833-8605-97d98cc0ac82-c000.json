{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01913v1\", \"title\": \"Representing Flow Fields with Divergence-Free Kernels for Reconstruction\", \"summary\": \"Accurately reconstructing continuous flow fields from sparse or indirect\\nmeasurements remains an open challenge, as existing techniques often suffer\\nfrom oversmoothing artifacts, reliance on heterogeneous architectures, and the\\ncomputational burden of enforcing physics-informed losses in implicit neural\\nrepresentations (INRs). In this paper, we introduce a novel flow field\\nreconstruction framework based on divergence-free kernels (DFKs), which\\ninherently enforce incompressibility while capturing fine structures without\\nrelying on hierarchical or heterogeneous representations. Through qualitative\\nanalysis and quantitative ablation studies, we identify the matrix-valued\\nradial basis functions derived from Wendland's $\\\\mathcal{C}^4$ polynomial\\n(DFKs-Wen4) as the optimal form of analytically divergence-free approximation\\nfor velocity fields, owing to their favorable numerical properties, including\\ncompact support, positive definiteness, and second-order differentiablility.\\nExperiments across various reconstruction tasks, spanning data compression,\\ninpainting, super-resolution, and time-continuous flow inference, has\\ndemonstrated that DFKs-Wen4 outperform INRs and other divergence-free\\nrepresentations in both reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency\\nwhile requiring the fewest trainable parameters.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GR\", \"categories\": \"cs.GR,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T17:13:59Z\"}"}
