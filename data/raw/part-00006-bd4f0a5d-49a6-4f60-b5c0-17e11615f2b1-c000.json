This modification alters the Z boson propagator and\\ndecay rate, impacting the Drell-Yan process cross-section at high-energy\\ncolliders. Observable effects are most pronounced near the resonance region at\\nhigh rapidities ($|Y| > 4$), potentially shifting the perceived Z boson mass\\nand inducing sidereal-time modulations for spacelike and lightlike LIV due to\\nEarth's rotation. We outline a targeted search strategy for ATLAS and CMS,\\nachieving sensitivity to LIV signatures down to $|\\\\delta_{LIV}| \\\\approx\\n10^{-8}$ (or $10^{-9}$ optimistically), offering new insights into historical\\nand future collider data. Our model predicts systematic shifts in weak boson\\nmasses at higher collision energies, relevant to past Tevatron and LHC\\ndiscrepancies, though current data are now consistent.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:46:22Z\"}"}
