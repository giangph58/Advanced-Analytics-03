{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21417v1\", \"title\": \"The Muon Collider\", \"summary\": \"Muons offer a unique opportunity to build a compact high-energy electroweak\\ncollider at the 10 TeV scale. A Muon Collider enables direct access to the\\nunderlying simplicity of the Standard Model and unparalleled reach beyond it.\\nIt will be a paradigm-shifting tool for particle physics representing the first\\ncollider to combine the high-energy reach of a proton collider and the high\\nprecision of an electron-positron collider, yielding a physics potential\\nsignificantly greater than the sum of its individual parts. A high-energy muon\\ncollider is the natural next step in the exploration of fundamental physics\\nafter the HL-LHC and a natural complement to a future low-energy Higgs factory.\\nSuch a facility would significantly broaden the scope of particle colliders,\\nengaging the many frontiers of the high energy community.\\n  The last European Strategy for Particle Physics Update and later the Particle\\nPhysics Project Prioritisation Panel in the US requested a study of the muon\\ncollider, which is being carried on by the International Muon Collider\\nCollaboration. In this comprehensive document we present the physics case, the\\nstate of the work on accelerator design and technology, and propose an R\\\\&D\\nproject that can make the muon collider a reality.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.acc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.acc-ph,hep-ex,hep-ph,physics.ins-det\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T08:19:39Z\"}"}
