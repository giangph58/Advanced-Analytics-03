However, two GW events,\\nGW190814 and GW200210, the mass of one companion object falls into the mass\\nregion of $(2.2-3)\\\\rm~M_\\\\odot$, and how to identify such object (e.g., as a\\nlow-mass black hole (BH) or a massive neutron star (NS)) remains an open\\nquestion. In this paper, we propose a method to identify the mystery compact\\nobject (MCO) with the mass region of $(2.2-3)\\\\rm~M_\\\\odot$ in a binary system\\nvia the possible electromagnetic (EM) radiations before and after the mergers.\\nA multi-band EM emission can be produced with $L\\\\propto(-t)^{7/4}$ (or\\n$L\\\\propto(-t)^{-5/4}$) during the inspiral phase due to the BH battery (or\\ninteraction magnetospheres) mechanism, and a bright (or dark) kilonova emission\\nis powered by radioactive decay with ejecta mass ratio $q>1.7$ (or $q<1.7$)\\nduring the post-merge state when MCO is as a low-mass BH (or massive NS) to\\nmerger with NS. Moreover, by considering the merger system between MCO and a BH\\nwhen MCO is a massive NS, we find that it requires the BH with high spin (e.g.,\\n$a\\\\sim0.8-0.99$) to make sure the tidal disruption event (TDE) occurred, and a\\nmulti-band precursor emission and bright kilonova emission can also be produced\\nduring the inspiral phase and post-merge state, respectively. In any case, no\\nmatter which mechanism we adopt, such precursor emissions are too weak to be\\ndetected by most current telescopes unless the distance is close enough.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T12:34:23Z\"}"}
