The\\nestimator is \\\"pretrained\\\" in the sense that the bulk of the computational cost\\nand researcher effort occur during the construction of the estimator.\\nSubsequent applications of the estimator to different datasets require little\\ncomputational cost or researcher effort. The estimation leverages a neural net\\nto recognize the structural model's parameter from data patterns. As an initial\\ntrial, this paper builds a pretrained estimator for a sequential search model\\nthat is known to be difficult to estimate. We evaluate the pretrained estimator\\non 14 real datasets. The estimation takes seconds to run and shows high\\naccuracy. We provide the estimator at pnnehome.github.io. More generally,\\npretrained, off-the-shelf estimators can make structural models more accessible\\nto researchers and practitioners.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.EM\", \"categories\": \"econ.EM,cs.LG,stat.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T13:51:01Z\"}"}
