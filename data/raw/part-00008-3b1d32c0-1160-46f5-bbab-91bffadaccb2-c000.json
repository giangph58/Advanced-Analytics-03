Furthermore, we demonstrate that the\\nEinstein--Euler--Heisenberg theory exhibits time advance when one or a linear\\ncombination of the coupling constants is positive and below an upper bound\\ndetermined by the AdS length scale.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T13:56:38Z\"}"}
