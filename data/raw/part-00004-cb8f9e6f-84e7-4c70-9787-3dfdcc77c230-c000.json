By varying the pump and probe intensities and polarization\\nconfigurations, we systematically map the MTS error-signal amplitude, effective\\nlinewidth, and slope for the ground-state crossover resonance\\n$F=1\\\\times2\\\\rightarrow F'=2$. We observe Rabi-induced power broadening and\\nidentify optimal conditions for laser frequency stabilization via tightly\\nfocused beams with total power below 1 mW. The lin$\\\\perp$lin polarization\\nconfiguration yields a sharp, symmetric, high-contrast error signal with a\\nmaximal slope. Our findings establish the MTS spectrum of the $^7$Li D1 line\\ntransitions as a reliable frequency reference for quantum technology and\\nultracold atom experiments, particularly in scenarios where frequency\\nstabilization must be achieved with low laser optical power.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T13:09:14Z\"}"}
