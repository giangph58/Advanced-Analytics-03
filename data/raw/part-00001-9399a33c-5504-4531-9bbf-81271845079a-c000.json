Our theory\\nconsiders a thin electrolyte film which is at all times in local equilibrium\\nacross its thickness. In addition to the usual lubrication force, we explicit\\nthe electro-kinetic force due to the transport of the diffuse electrical\\ncharges as well as the diffusio-kinetic force due to the transport of the\\nexcess ion concentration in the Electrostatic Double Layers (EDLs). Our general\\nformalism covers both the case of non-overlapping EDLs and of overlapping EDLs.\\nWe study more specifically the mechanical impedance induced by an oscillatory\\nmotion of small amplitude of the surfaces. Among our main results, we show that\\nthe increase in damping due to the electro-kinetic effect is not monotonic with\\nthe surface charge, and we predict a diffusio-kinetic stiffness with a\\nlong-range decay in power minus four of the sphere-plane gap susceptible to\\novercoming the stiffness of the equilibrium Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek\\nforce. The comparison of our results with experiments could allow one to\\nconfront the theories of electrolyte transport in the Electrostatic Double\\nLayers without adjustable parameters.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T08:58:47Z\"}"}
