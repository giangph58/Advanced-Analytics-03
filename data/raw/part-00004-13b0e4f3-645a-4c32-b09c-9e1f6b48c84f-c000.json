{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04921v1\", \"title\": \"Expectations vs Reality -- A Secondary Study on AI Adoption in Software\\n  Testing\", \"summary\": \"In the software industry, artificial intelligence (AI) has been utilized more\\nand more in software development activities. In some activities, such as\\ncoding, AI has already been an everyday tool, but in software testing\\nactivities AI it has not yet made a significant breakthrough. In this paper,\\nthe objective was to identify what kind of empirical research with industry\\ncontext has been conducted on AI in software testing, as well as how AI has\\nbeen adopted in software testing practice. To achieve this, we performed a\\nsystematic mapping study of recent (2020 and later) studies on AI adoption in\\nsoftware testing in the industry, and applied thematic analysis to identify\\ncommon themes and categories, such as the real-world use cases and benefits, in\\nthe found papers. The observations suggest that AI is not yet heavily utilized\\nin software testing, and still relatively few studies on AI adoption in\\nsoftware testing have been conducted in the industry context to solve\\nreal-world problems. Earlier studies indicated there was a noticeable gap\\nbetween the actual use cases and actual benefits versus the expectations, which\\nwe analyzed further. While there were numerous potential use cases for AI in\\nsoftware testing, such as test case generation, code analysis, and intelligent\\ntest automation, the reported actual implementations and observed benefits were\\nlimited. In addition, the systematic mapping study revealed a potential problem\\nwith false positive search results in online databases when using the search\\nstring \\\"artificial intelligence\\\".\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:03:54Z\"}"}
