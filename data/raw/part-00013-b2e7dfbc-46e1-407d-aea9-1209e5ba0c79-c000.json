{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11012v1\", \"title\": \"Structure and dynamics of open-shell nuclei from spherical\\n  coupled-cluster theory\", \"summary\": \"We extend the spherical coupled-cluster ab initio method for open-shell\\nnuclei where two nucleons are removed from a shell subclosure. Following the\\nrecent implementation of the two-particle attached approach [Phys. Rev.C 110\\n(2024) 4, 044306], we focus on the two-particle-removed method. Using the\\nequations-of-motion framework, we address both nuclear structure and dipole\\nresponse functions by coupling coupled-cluster theory with the Lorentz integral\\ntransform technique. We perform calculations using chiral interactions,\\nincluding three-nucleon forces, and estimate many-body uncertainties by\\ncomparing different coupled-cluster truncation schemes. We validate our\\napproach by studying ground-state energies, excited states, and electric dipole\\npolarizabilities in the oxygen and calcium isotopic chains. For binding\\nenergies and selected low-lying excited states, we achieve an accuracy\\ncomparable to that of the established closed-shell coupled-cluster theory and\\ngenerally agree with experiment. Finally, we underestimate experimental data\\nfor electric dipole polarizabilities, particularly in calcium isotopes.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T09:32:57Z\"}"}
