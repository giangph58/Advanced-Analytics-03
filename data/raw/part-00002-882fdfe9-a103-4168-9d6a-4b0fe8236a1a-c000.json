{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05054v1\", \"title\": \"Direct Image Classification from Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy\\n  Measurements without Reconstruction\", \"summary\": \"The computational imaging technique of Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy (FPM)\\nenables high-resolution imaging with a wide field of view and can serve as an\\nextremely valuable tool, e.g. in the classification of cells in medical\\napplications. However, reconstructing a high-resolution image from tens or even\\nhundreds of measurements is computationally expensive, particularly for a wide\\nfield of view. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the idea of classifying\\nthe image content in the FPM measurements directly without performing a\\nreconstruction step first. We show that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can\\nextract meaningful information from measurement sequences, significantly\\noutperforming the classification on a single band-limited image (up to 12 %)\\nwhile being significantly more efficient than a reconstruction of a\\nhigh-resolution image. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a learned multiplexing\\nof several raw measurements allows maintaining the classification accuracy\\nwhile reducing the amount of data (and consequently also the acquisition time)\\nsignificantly.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.AI,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T08:46:28Z\"}"}
