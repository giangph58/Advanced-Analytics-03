{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12761v1\", \"title\": \"Temporal Variation of Flare Occurrence Rates via the Spot Evolution on\\n  the Sun and Solar-type Stars\", \"summary\": \"The spot evolution on the Sun and solar-type stars is important for\\nunderstanding the nature of consequential flaring activity. This study\\nstatistically investigates the variance of flare occurrence rate through the\\ntime evolution of spots on the Sun and solar-type stars. We have compiled the\\n28-year catalogs of solar flares and their source sunspots obtained from solar\\nsurface observations by NOAA and GOES for the Sun. Also, we combined the\\ncataloged stellar flares with the time evolution of starspots estimated by\\nlight curves obtained by the 4-year Kepler mission for solar-type stars. For\\nthe obtained 24124 solar flares and 180 stellar flares, we calculate the flare\\noccurrence distribution with respect to $t_\\\\mathrm{flare}-t_\\\\mathrm{max}$,\\nwhich represents the timing of flare through the spot evolution, where\\n$t_\\\\mathrm{flare}$ is the flare occurrence time, and $t_\\\\mathrm{max}$ is the\\ntime when the source spot takes its maximum area. When normalized by the spot\\nlifetime, we found that the flare occurrence distribution for\\n$t_\\\\mathrm{flare}-t_\\\\mathrm{max}$ shows a similar distribution regardless of\\nspot size or flare energy, suggesting that the Sun and the solar-type star\\nshare the same physical process in the spot-to-flare activity. On this basis,\\nwe propose a formula for the time variation of the flare occurrence rate per\\nspot. Also, the correlation between the temporal variation of flare occurrence\\nrate and the time evolution of spot area and the lack of difference in flare\\noccurrence rate between the emergence and decaying phases provide a milestone\\nfor the nature of flare-productive spots.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T08:56:43Z\"}"}
