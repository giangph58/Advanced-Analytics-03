{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07868v1\", \"title\": \"SAFARI: a Scalable Air-gapped Framework for Automated Ransomware\\n  Investigation\", \"summary\": \"Ransomware poses a significant threat to individuals and organisations,\\ncompelling tools to investigate its behaviour and the effectiveness of\\nmitigations. To answer this need, we present SAFARI, an open-source framework\\ndesigned for safe and efficient ransomware analysis. SAFARI's design emphasises\\nscalability, air-gapped security, and automation, democratising access to safe\\nransomware investigation tools and fostering collaborative efforts. SAFARI\\nleverages virtualisation, Infrastructure-as-Code, and OS-agnostic task\\nautomation to create isolated environments for controlled ransomware execution\\nand analysis. The framework enables researchers to profile ransomware behaviour\\nand evaluate mitigation strategies through automated, reproducible experiments.\\nWe demonstrate SAFARI's capabilities by building a proof-of-concept\\nimplementation and using it to run two case studies. The first analyses five\\nrenowned ransomware strains (including WannaCry and LockBit) to identify their\\nencryption patterns and file targeting strategies. The second evaluates\\nRanflood, a contrast tool which we use against three dangerous strains. Our\\nresults provide insights into ransomware behaviour and the effectiveness of\\ncountermeasures, showcasing SAFARI's potential to advance ransomware research\\nand defence development.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:44:13Z\"}"}
