The players alternatively perform a move consisting of\\nchoosing an edge incident to the root vertex, removing the chosen edge, and\\nmarking the other endpoint as a new root vertex. The first player who cannot\\nperform a move is the loser. In this paper, we are interested in the undirected\\nedge geography game on the grid graph $P_m\\\\square P_n$. We completely determine\\nwhether the root vertex is a winning position (N-position) or a losing position\\n(P-position). Moreover, we give a winning strategy for the winner.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T14:57:08Z\"}"}
