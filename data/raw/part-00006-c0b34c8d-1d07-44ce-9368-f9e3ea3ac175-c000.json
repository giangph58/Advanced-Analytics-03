{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20950v1\", \"title\": \"Improved Bounds on the Space Complexity of Circuit Evaluation\", \"summary\": \"Williams (STOC 2025) recently proved that time-$t$ multitape Turing machines\\ncan be simulated using $O(\\\\sqrt{t \\\\log t})$ space using the Cook-Mertz (STOC\\n2024) tree evaluation procedure. As Williams notes, applying this result to\\nfast algorithms for the circuit value problem implies an $O(\\\\sqrt{s} \\\\cdot\\n\\\\mathrm{polylog}\\\\; s)$ algorithm for evaluating size $s$ circuits.\\n  In this work, we provide a direct reduction from circuit value to tree\\nevaluation without passing through Turing machines, simultaneously improving\\nthe bound to $O(\\\\sqrt{s \\\\log s})$ space and providing a proof with fewer\\nabstraction layers.\\n  This result can be thought of as a \\\"sibling\\\" result to Williams' for circuit\\ncomplexity instead of time; in particular, using the fact that time-$t$ Turing\\nmachines have size $O(t \\\\log t)$ circuits, we can recover a slightly weakened\\nversion of Williams' result, simulating time-$t$ machines in space $O(\\\\sqrt{t}\\n\\\\log t)$.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CC\", \"categories\": \"cs.CC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:18:52Z\"}"}
