Here, we examine the fate\\nof weak ergodicity breaking in systems hosting quantum many-body scars when\\nsubject to local pure dephasing -- an experimentally relevant form of\\nenvironmental noise. Focusing on a large class of models with an approximate\\nsu(2)-structured scar subspace, we show that scarred eigenmodes of the\\nLiouvillean exhibit a transition reminiscent of spontaneous\\n$\\\\mathbb{PT}$-symmetry breaking as the dephasing strength increases. Unlike\\npreviously studied non-Hermitian mechanisms, this transition arises from a\\ndistinct quantum jump effect. Remarkably, in platforms such as the XY spin\\nladder and PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, the critical dephasing rate shows\\nonly weak dependence on system size, revealing an unexpected robustness of\\nscarred dynamics in noisy quantum simulators.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T17:55:02Z\"}"}
