{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20801v1\", \"title\": \"Unlocking User-oriented Pages: Intention-driven Black-box Scanner for\\n  Real-world Web Applications\", \"summary\": \"Black-box scanners have played a significant role in detecting\\nvulnerabilities for web applications. A key focus in current black-box scanning\\nis increasing test coverage (i.e., accessing more web pages). However, since\\nmany web applications are user-oriented, some deep pages can only be accessed\\nthrough complex user interactions, which are difficult to reach by existing\\nblack-box scanners. To fill this gap, a key insight is that web pages contain a\\nwealth of semantic information that can aid in understanding potential user\\nintention. Based on this insight, we propose Hoyen, a black-box scanner that\\nuses the Large Language Model to predict user intention and provide guidance\\nfor expanding the scanning scope. Hoyen has been rigorously evaluated on 12\\npopular open-source web applications and compared with 6 representative tools.\\nThe results demonstrate that Hoyen performs a comprehensive exploration of web\\napplications, expanding the attack surface while achieving about 2x than the\\ncoverage of other scanners on average, with high request accuracy. Furthermore,\\nHoyen detected over 90% of its requests towards the core functionality of the\\napplication, detecting more vulnerabilities than other scanners, including\\nunique vulnerabilities in well-known web applications.
