In this paper, we\\ncompare the two analytical methods commonly utilized in the literature for this\\npurpose: the cut-set integral and the self-adjoint operator. We provide a\\ndetailed description of both methods and discuss their advantages and\\nlimitations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,eess.SP,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T15:41:28Z\"}"}
