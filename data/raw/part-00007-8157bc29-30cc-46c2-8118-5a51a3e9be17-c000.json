A Feature-Based Literature Survey\", \"summary\": \"The digital transformation of our society is a constant challenge, as data is\\ngenerated in almost every digital interaction. To use data effectively, it must\\nbe of high quality. This raises the question: what exactly is data quality? A\\nsystematic literature review of the existing literature shows that data quality\\nis a multifaceted concept, characterized by a number of quality dimensions.\\nHowever, the definitions of data quality vary widely. We used feature-oriented\\ndomain analysis to specify a taxonomy of data quality definitions and to\\nclassify the existing definitions. This allows us to identify research gaps and\\nfuture topics.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DB\", \"categories\": \"cs.DB\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:46:19Z\"}"}
