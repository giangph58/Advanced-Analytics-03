{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16547v1\", \"title\": \"Generation of Phonons with Angular Momentum During Ultrafast\\n  Demagnetization\", \"summary\": \"A major question in the field of femtosecond laser-induced demagnetization is\\nwhereto the angular momentum lost by the electrons is transferred. Recent\\nultrafast electron diffraction measurements [Tauchert \\\\textit{et al.}, Nature\\n{\\\\bf 602}, 73 (2022)] suggest that this angular momentum is transferred to the\\nrotational motion of atoms on a sub-picosecond timescale, but a theory\\nconfirmation of this proposition has yet to be given. Here we investigate the\\ncoupled electron-nuclear dynamics during ultrafast demagnetization of L1$_0$\\nFePt, using Ehrenfest nuclear dynamics simulations combined with the\\ntime-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) framework. We demonstrate that\\natomic rotations appear, i.e., the generation of phonons carrying finite\\nangular momentum following ultrafast demagnetization. We further show that both\\nultrafast demagnetization and the generation of phonons with angular momentum\\narise from symmetry constraints imposed by the spin-orbit coupling, thus\\nproviding insight in spin-phonon interaction at ultrafast timescales.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T09:23:31Z\"}"}
