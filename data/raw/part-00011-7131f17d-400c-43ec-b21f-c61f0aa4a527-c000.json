{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00285v1\", \"title\": \"An Efficient Decomposition of the Carleman Linearized Burgers' Equation\", \"summary\": \"Herein, we present a polylogarithmic decomposition method to load the matrix\\nfrom the linearized 1-dimensional Burgers' equation onto a quantum computer.\\nFirst, we use the Carleman linearization method to map the nonlinear Burgers'\\nequation into an infinite linear system of equations, which is subsequently\\ntruncated to order $\\\\alpha$. This new finite linear system is then embedded\\ninto a larger system of equations with the key property that its matrix can be\\ndecomposed into a linear combination of $\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\log n_t + \\\\alpha^2\\\\log\\nn_x)$ terms, where $n_t$ is the number of time steps and $n_x$ is the number of\\nspatial grid points. While the terms in this linear combination are not\\nunitary, we have extended the methods of [arXiv:2404.16991] to block encode\\nthem and apply the variational quantuam linear solver (VQLS)\\n[arXiv:1909.05820v4] routine to obtain a solution. Finally, a complexity\\nanalysis of the required VQLS circuits shows that the upper bound of the\\ntwo-qubit gate depth among all of the block encoded matrices is\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\alpha(\\\\log n_x)^2)$.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T04:18:28Z\"}"}
