While Jarzynski's\\nequality offers a theoretical approach, it becomes unreliable at low\\ntemperatures due to rare divergent statistical fluctuations. Here, we present a\\nprotocol that overcomes this limitation by synergizing reverse quantum\\nannealing with tailored nonequilibrium initial distributions. Our method can\\ndramatically suppress the estimator variance, achieving saturation in the\\nlow-temperature regime. Numerical benchmarks on the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick\\nspin glass and the 3-SAT problem demonstrate that our protocol reduces scaling\\nexponents by over an order of magnitude (e.g., from ~8.5 to ~0.5), despite\\nretaining exponential system-size dependences. Crucially, our protocol\\ncircumvents stringent adiabatic constraints, making it feasible for near-term\\nquantum devices like superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and Rydberg atom\\narrays. This work bridges quantum dynamics with computational complexity,\\noffering a practical pathway to quantum advantage in spin glass thermodynamics\\nand beyond.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.dis-nn,cond-mat.stat-mech,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:09:40Z\"}"}
