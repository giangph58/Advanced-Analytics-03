We validate the GHBMC model\\nagainst a 50\\\\%tile male Post-Mortem Human Surrogate (PMHS) test. Using this\\nvalidated model, we create various postured models and generate injury\\nprediction data across different postures and personalized D-ring heights\\nthrough parametric crash simulations. We then train the GP using this\\nsimulation data, implementing a novel adaptive sampling approach to improve\\naccuracy. The trained GP model demonstrates robustness by achieving target\\nprediction accuracy at points with high uncertainty. The proposed method\\nperforms continuous injury prediction for various crash scenarios using just 27\\ncomputationally expensive simulation runs. This method can be effectively\\napplied to designing highly reliable occupant restraint systems across diverse\\ncrash conditions.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T09:17:39Z\"}"}
