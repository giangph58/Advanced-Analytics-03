{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10255v1\", \"title\": \"Dissipation-Induced Threshold on Integrability Footprints\", \"summary\": \"The presence of a dissipative environment disrupts the unitary spectrum of\\ndynamical quantum maps. Nevertheless, key features of the underlying unitary\\ndynamics -- such as their integrable or chaotic nature -- are not immediately\\nerased by dissipation. To investigate this, we model dissipation as a convex\\ncombination of a unitary evolution and a random Kraus map, and study how\\nsignatures of integrability fade as dissipation strength increases. Our\\nanalysis shows that in the weakly dissipative regime, the complex eigenvalue\\nspectrum organizes into well-defined, high-density clusters. We estimate the\\ncritical dissipation threshold beyond which these clusters disappear, rendering\\nthe dynamics indistinguishable from chaotic evolution. This threshold depends\\nonly on the number of spectral clusters and the rank of the random Kraus\\noperator. To characterize this transition, we introduce the eigenvalue angular\\nvelocity as a diagnostic of integrability loss. We illustrate our findings\\nthrough several integrable quantum circuits, including the dissipative quantum\\nFourier transform. Our results provide a quantitative picture of how noise\\ngradually erases the footprints of integrability in open quantum systems.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.dis-nn,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T14:16:37Z\"}"}
