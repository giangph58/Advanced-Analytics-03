{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06550v1\", \"title\": \"Blameocracy: Causal Attribution in Political Communication\", \"summary\": \"We propose a supervised method to detect causal attribution in political\\ntexts, distinguishing between expressions of merit and blame. Analyzing four\\nmillion tweets shared by U.S. Congress members from 2012 to 2023, we document a\\npronounced shift toward causal attribution following the 2016 presidential\\nelection. The shift reflects changes in rhetorical strategy rather than\\ncompositional variation in the actors or topics of the political debate. Within\\ncausal communication, a trade-off emerges between positive and negative tone,\\nwith power status as the key determinant: government emphasizes merit, while\\nopposition casts blame. This pattern distinguishes causal from purely affective\\ncommunication. Additionally, we find that blame is associated with lower trust\\nin politicians, perceived government effectiveness, and spreads more virally\\nthan merit.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T03:12:16Z\"}"}
