With the evolution towards\\nartificial general intelligence (AGI), the increasing demands for AGI services\\npose new challenges to semantic communication. In response, we propose a new\\nparadigm for AGI-driven communications, called generative semantic\\ncommunication (GSC), which utilizes advanced AI technologies such as foundation\\nmodels and generative models. We first describe the basic concept of GSC and\\nits difference from existing semantic communications, and then introduce a\\ngeneral framework of GSC, followed by two case studies to verify the advantages\\nof GSC in AGI-driven applications. Finally, open challenges and new research\\ndirections are discussed to stimulate this line of research and pave the way\\nfor practical applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,eess.IV,eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T08:10:59Z\"}"}
