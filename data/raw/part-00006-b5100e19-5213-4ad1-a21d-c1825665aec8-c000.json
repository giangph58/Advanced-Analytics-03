The dataset includes an AMD cohort of 147 patients (aged 54-94) with\\nvarying stages of AMD and a control group of 190 diabetic retinopathy (DR)\\npatients (aged 24-92). AMD diagnoses were based on comprehensive clinical\\nophthalmic evaluations, supported by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and OCT\\nangiography. Non-AMD DFIs were sourced from DR patients without concurrent AMD,\\ndiagnosed using macular OCT, fluorescein angiography, and widefield imaging.\\nHYAMD provides gold-standard annotations, ensuring AMD labels were assigned\\nfollowing a full clinical assessment. Images were captured with a DRI OCT\\nTriton (Topcon) camera, offering a 45 deg field of view and 1960 x 1934 pixel\\nresolution. To the best of our knowledge, HYAMD is the first open-access\\nretinal dataset from an Israeli sample, designed to support AMD identification\\nusing machine learning models.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,q-bio.TO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:27:44Z\"}"}
