Rev. B 85, 205119 (2012). As an alternative to\\nthe density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), the Lanczos algorithm avoids\\nlocal minima and can directly find multiple low-lying eigenstates. However, its\\nperformance and accuracy are affected by the truncation required to maintain\\nthe efficiency of the tensor network representation. In this work, we enhance\\nits convergence by restarting with multiple states. We benchmark our method on\\none-dimensional instances of the Fermi-Hubbard model with 8 sites and the\\nHeisenberg model with 16 sites in an external field, using numerical\\nexperiments targeting the first five lowest eigenstates. Across these tests,\\nour approach obtains accuracy improvements of three to seven orders of\\nmagnitude. Finally, we extend the Heisenberg model simulation to a lattice with\\n30 sites to highlight its scalability.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,physics.comp-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T16:45:25Z\"}"}
