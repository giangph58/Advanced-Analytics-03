We conducted 40 hours of imaging observations using NenuFAR,\\nin the 30.8-78.3 MHz range. Observations included both targeted tracking of\\nspecific satellites based on orbital predictions and untargeted searches\\nfocused on high-elevation regions of the sky. Images in total intensity and\\npolarimetry were obtained, and full Stokes dynamic spectra were generated for\\nseveral hundred directions within the Field of View. Detected signals were\\ncross-matched with satellite orbital data to confirm satellite associations.\\nDetailed analyses of the observed spectra, polarization, and temporal\\ncharacteristics were performed to investigate the origin and properties of the\\ndetected emissions. We detected broadband emissions from Starlink satellites,\\npredominantly between 54-66 MHz, with flux densities exceeding 500 Jy. These\\nsignals are highly polarized and unlikely to originate from ground-based RFI or\\nreflected astronomical sources. Instead, they are likely intrinsic to the\\nsatellites, with distinct differences in emission properties observed between\\nsatellite generations. These findings highlight significant challenges to data\\nprocessing and scientific discoveries at these low frequencies, emphasizing the\\nneed for effective mitigation strategies, particularly through collaboration\\nbetween astronomers and satellite operators.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:35:46Z\"}"}
