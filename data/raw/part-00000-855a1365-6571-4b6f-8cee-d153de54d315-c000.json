{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04747v1\", \"title\": \"Two is Better than One: Efficient Ensemble Defense for Robust and\\n  Compact Models\", \"summary\": \"Deep learning-based computer vision systems adopt complex and large\\narchitectures to improve performance, yet they face challenges in deployment on\\nresource-constrained mobile and edge devices. To address this issue, model\\ncompression techniques such as pruning, quantization, and matrix factorization\\nhave been proposed; however, these compressed models are often highly\\nvulnerable to adversarial attacks. We introduce the \\\\textbf{Efficient Ensemble\\nDefense (EED)} technique, which diversifies the compression of a single base\\nmodel based on different pruning importance scores and enhances ensemble\\ndiversity to achieve high adversarial robustness and resource efficiency. EED\\ndynamically determines the number of necessary sub-models during the inference\\nstage, minimizing unnecessary computations while maintaining high robustness.\\nOn the CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets, EED demonstrated state-of-the-art robustness\\nperformance compared to existing adversarial pruning techniques, along with an\\ninference speed improvement of up to 1.86 times. This proves that EED is a\\npowerful defense solution in resource-constrained environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T05:41:35Z\"}"}
