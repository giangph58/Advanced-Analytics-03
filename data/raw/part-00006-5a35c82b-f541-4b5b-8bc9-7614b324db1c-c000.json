{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04453v1\", \"title\": \"Meta-Learning Driven Lightweight Phase Shift Compression for\\n  IRS-Assisted Wireless Systems\", \"summary\": \"The phase shift information (PSI) overhead poses a critical challenge to\\nenabling real-time intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted wireless\\nsystems, particularly under dynamic and resource-constrained conditions. In\\nthis paper, we propose a lightweight PSI compression framework, termed\\nmeta-learning-driven compression and reconstruction network (MCRNet). By\\nleveraging a few-shot adaptation strategy via model-agnostic meta-learning\\n(MAML), MCRNet enables rapid generalization across diverse IRS configurations\\nwith minimal retraining overhead. Furthermore, a novel depthwise convolutional\\ngating (DWCG) module is incorporated into the decoder to achieve adaptive local\\nfeature modulation with low computational cost, significantly improving\\ndecoding efficiency. Extensive simulations demonstrate that MCRNet achieves\\ncompetitive normalized mean square error performance compared to\\nstate-of-the-art baselines across various compression ratios, while\\nsubstantially reducing model size and inference latency. These results validate\\nthe effectiveness of the proposed asymmetric architecture and highlight the\\npractical scalability and real-time applicability of MCRNet for dynamic\\nIRS-assisted wireless deployments.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:25:47Z\"}"}
