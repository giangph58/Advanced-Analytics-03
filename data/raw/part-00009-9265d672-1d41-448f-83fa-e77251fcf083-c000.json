We performed a\\nstate-of-the-art lattice QCD calculation by taking into account all sources of\\nsystematic errors. A detailed discussion of our lattice calculation,\\ndemonstrating that inclusive semileptonic decays can nowadays be studied on the\\nlattice at a phenomenologically relevant level of accuracy, is the subject of a\\ncompanion paper [1]. Here we focus on the phenomenological implications of our\\nresults. Using the current best estimates of the relevant\\nCabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements, our theoretical predictions\\nfor the decay rate and for the first two lepton-energy moments are in very good\\nagreement with the corresponding experimental measurements. We also argue that,\\nwhile the inclusive $D_{s}$ channel is not yet competitive with the exclusive\\nchannels in the $|V_{cs}|$ determination, the situation can be significantly\\nimproved in the near future.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-lat\", \"categories\": \"hep-lat,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:08:18Z\"}"}
