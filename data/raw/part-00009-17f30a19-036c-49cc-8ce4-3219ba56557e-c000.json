By incorporating low-rank adaptation techniques into one-shot\\ndetection architectures, our method significantly reduces both computational\\nand communication overhead while maintaining scalable accuracy. The proposed\\nframework leverages federated learning to collaboratively train lightweight\\nimage recognition models, enabling rapid adaptation and efficient deployment\\nacross heterogeneous, resource-constrained devices. Experimental evaluations on\\nthe MNIST and CIFAR10 benchmark datasets, both in an\\nindependent-and-identically-distributed (IID) and non-IID setting, demonstrate\\nthat our approach achieves competitive detection performance while\\nsignificantly reducing communication bandwidth and compute complexity. This\\nmakes it a promising solution for adaptively reducing the communication and\\ncompute power overheads, while not sacrificing model accuracy.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T08:40:44Z\"}"}
