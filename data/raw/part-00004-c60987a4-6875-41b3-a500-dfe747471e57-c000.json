Constraints necessitate randomization when\\nsolving for optimal solutions -- our past results show that joint randomization\\namongst the team is necessary for (strong) Lagrangian duality to hold -- , but\\na better understanding of randomization still remains. For a partially observed\\nmulti-agent system with Borel hidden state and finite observations and actions,\\nwe prove the equivalence between joint mixtures of decentralized\\npolicy-profiles (both pure and behavioral) and common-information based\\nbehavioral coordination policies (also mixtures of them). This generalizes past\\nwork that shows equivalence between pure decentralized policy-profiles and pure\\ncoordination policies. The equivalence can be exploited to develop results on\\nstrong duality and number of randomizations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T04:34:14Z\"}"}
