{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20697v1\", \"title\": \"A Decentralized Local Flexibility Market for Local Energy Communities to\\n  Mitigate Grid Congestion: A Case Study in Sweden\", \"summary\": \"This paper proposes a preventive congestion management framework with joint\\nLocal Flexibility Capacity Market (LFCM) and Local Energy Markets (LEMs). The\\nframework enables Local Energy Communities (LECs) to optimize their flexibility\\npotential across the LEM, LFCM, and heat markets. The LECs utilize their heat\\nand electricity resources to offer flexibility services to Distribution System\\nOperators (DSOs) for congestion relief. In this framework, energy and\\nflexibility are treated as separate variables, each subject to different\\npricing scheme. Flexibility prices are market-driven, dynamically reflecting\\nthe location and severity of congestion. A case study conducted at Chalmers\\nUniversity of Technology, Sweden, shows that the proposed framework can\\neffectively mitigate congestion by trading the LECs flexibility in the LFCM.\\nThe study also highlights up to 40% financial benefits for LECs, promoting the\\nLFCM as a viable solution for congestion management in future decentralized\\nenergy systems.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T12:22:35Z\"}"}
