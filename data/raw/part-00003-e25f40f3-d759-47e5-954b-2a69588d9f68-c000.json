{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15178v1\", \"title\": \"Time-Series Analysis on Edge-AI Hardware for Healthcare Monitoring\", \"summary\": \"This project addresses the need for efficient, real-time analysis of\\nbiomedical signals such as electrocardiograms (ECG) and electroencephalograms\\n(EEG) for continuous health monitoring. Traditional methods rely on\\nlong-duration data recording followed by offline analysis, which is\\npower-intensive and delays responses to critical symptoms such as arrhythmia.\\nTo overcome these limitations, a time-domain ECG analysis model based on a\\nnovel dynamically-biased Long Short-Term Memory (DB-LSTM) neural network is\\nproposed. This model supports simultaneous ECG forecasting and classification\\nwith high performance-achieving over 98% accuracy and a normalized mean square\\nerror below 1e-3 for forecasting, and over 97% accuracy with faster convergence\\nand fewer training parameters for classification. To enable edge deployment,\\nthe model is hardware-optimized by quantizing weights to INT4 or INT3 formats,\\nresulting in only a 2% and 6% drop in classification accuracy during training\\nand inference, respectively, while maintaining full accuracy for forecasting.\\nExtensive simulations using multiple ECG datasets confirm the model's\\nrobustness. Future work includes implementing the algorithm on FPGA and CMOS\\ncircuits for practical cardiac monitoring, as well as developing a digital\\nhardware platform that supports flexible neural network configurations and\\non-chip online training for personalized healthcare applications.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T15:40:10Z\"}"}
