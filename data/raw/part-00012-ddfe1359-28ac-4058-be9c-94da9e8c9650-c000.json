In this research we\\npresent an extensive analysis of the charge-ordering phenomenon of the\\ntriangular-lattice extended Hubbard model with repulsive onsite and\\nnearest-neighbor interaction, arbitrary charge concentration, and\\n$\\\\sqrt{3}\\\\times\\\\sqrt{3}$ supercell (3-sublattice assumption). The model is\\nsolved in the ground state with the mean-field approximation which allowed to\\nidentify $8$ charge-ordered phases and a large variety of phase transitions. An\\nexotic pinball-liquid phase was found and described. Moreover, strong\\nparticle-hole asymmetry of the phase diagram is found to play an important role\\nfor triangular lattices. The analysis of band structures, unavailable for more\\nadvanced methods that take into account correlation effects, provided a great\\ninsight in the nature of triangular-lattice phases and phase transitions. The\\ncomplexity of the mean-field phase diagram showed the importance and usefulness\\nof the results for the further research with correlation effects included.\\nTogether with atomic-limit approximation it can serve them as both a starting\\npoint, and a tool to interpret results.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.other,cond-mat.quant-gas,cond-mat.stat-mech,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T12:58:57Z\"}"}
