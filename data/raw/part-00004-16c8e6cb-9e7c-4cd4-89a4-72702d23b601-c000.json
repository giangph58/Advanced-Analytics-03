To this end, we\\nexplicitly determine the terms of the upper and the lower central series of\\n$W_n$. We provide a similar description of these series in the Lie algebra\\nassociated to $W_n$, giving a new proof of the equality of their terms in both\\nthe group and the algebra contexts. Finally, we calculate the growth of the\\nnormalizer chain starting from an elementary abelian regular subgroup of $W_n$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GR\", \"categories\": \"math.GR,math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T16:48:23Z\"}"}
