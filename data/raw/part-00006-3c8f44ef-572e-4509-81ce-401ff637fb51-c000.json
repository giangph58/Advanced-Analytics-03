Using this idea, we construct a\\nnon-supersymmetric framework using polyharmonic $Maa\\\\beta$ forms. In this\\napproach, the Yukawa coupling is no longer strictly holomorphic in $\\\\tau$ but\\ninstead incorporates both holomorphic and non-holomorphic components. We\\nrealize a non-supersymmetric, left-right asymmetric model based on the\\n$\\\\Gamma_3$ modular group, where the active neutrino masses are generated via an\\nextended inverse seesaw mechanism. The model successfully predicts the sum of\\nneutrino masses below the current experimental bound and accommodates neutrino\\nmixing angles within the $3\\\\sigma$ range. Given its strong predictive power in\\nneutrino oscillation parameters, we further explore its implications for beyond\\nStandard Model (BSM) phenomena, including neutrinoless double beta\\n($0\\\\nu\\\\beta\\\\beta$) decay, lepton flavor violation (LFV), and baryogenesis via\\nleptogenesis (BAU). Our findings indicate that the model predicts an effective\\nMajorana mass and LFV branching ratios consistent with experimental constraints\\nwhile also providing a viable explanation for the observed baryon asymmetry\\nthrough resonant leptogenesis.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:44:56Z\"}"}
