This study proposes a two-stage\\napproach to capture and analyze these complexities using an extensive dataset\\nof 1,328,334 field measurements collected over six months in a single-floor\\noffice at the University of Siegen's Hoelderlinstrasse Campus, Germany. First,\\nwe implement a multiple linear regression model that includes traditional\\npropagation metrics (distance, structural walls) and an extension with proposed\\nenvironmental variables (relative humidity, temperature, carbon dioxide,\\nparticulate matter, and barometric pressure). Using analysis of variance, we\\ndemonstrate that adding these environmental factors can reduce unexplained\\nvariance by 42.32 percent. Secondly, we examine residual distributions by\\nfitting five candidate probability distributions: Normal, Skew-Normal, Cauchy,\\nStudent's t, and Gaussian Mixture Models with one to five components. Our\\nresults show that a four-component Gaussian Mixture Model captures the residual\\nheterogeneity of indoor signal propagation most accurately, significantly\\noutperforming single-distribution approaches. Given the push toward\\nultra-reliable, context-aware communications in 6G networks, our analysis shows\\nthat environment-aware modeling can substantially improve LoRaWAN network\\ndesign in dynamic indoor IoT deployments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI,cs.LG,eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T13:19:35Z\"}"}
