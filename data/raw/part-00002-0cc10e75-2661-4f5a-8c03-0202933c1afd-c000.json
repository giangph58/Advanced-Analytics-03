By combining two optical lattices with\\nslightly different wavelengths, a beatnote intensity pattern is formed,\\ngenerating, for low depths, an effective lattice potential with a periodicity\\nequal to the wavelength associated to the difference between the wavevectors of\\nthe two lattices. We study the range of lattice depths and wavelengths under\\nwhich this approximation is valid and investigate its robustness against\\nperturbations. We present a few examples where the use of BNSLs could offer\\nsignificant advantages in comparison to well established techniques for the\\nmanipulation of ultracold atomic gases. Our results highlight the potential of\\nBNSLs for quantum simulation, atom interferometry, and other applications in\\nquantum technologies.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas,physics.atom-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T10:46:16Z\"}"}
