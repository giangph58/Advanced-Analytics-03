{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04525v1\", \"title\": \"On some improvements to Unbounded Minimax\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents the first experimental evaluation of four previously\\nuntested modifications of Unbounded Best-First Minimax algorithm. This\\nalgorithm explores the game tree by iteratively expanding the most promising\\nsequences of actions based on the current partial game tree. We first evaluate\\nthe use of transposition tables, which convert the game tree into a directed\\nacyclic graph by merging duplicate states. Second, we compare the original\\nalgorithm by Korf & Chickering with the variant proposed by Cohen-Solal, which\\ndiffers in its backpropagation strategy: instead of stopping when a stable\\nvalue is encountered, it updates values up to the root. This change slightly\\nimproves performance when value ties or transposition tables are involved.\\nThird, we assess replacing the exact terminal evaluation function with the\\nlearned heuristic function. While beneficial when exact evaluations are costly,\\nthis modification reduces performance in inexpensive settings. Finally, we\\nexamine the impact of the completion technique that prioritizes resolved\\nwinning states and avoids resolved losing states. This technique also improves\\nperformance. Overall, our findings highlight how targeted modifications can\\nenhance the efficiency of Unbounded Best-First Minimax.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T15:59:19Z\"}"}
