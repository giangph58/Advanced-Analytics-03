{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06667v1\", \"title\": \"Toward Holistic Evaluation of Recommender Systems Powered by Generative\\n  Models\", \"summary\": \"Recommender systems powered by generative models (Gen-RecSys) extend beyond\\nclassical item ranking by producing open-ended content, which simultaneously\\nunlocks richer user experiences and introduces new risks. On one hand, these\\nsystems can enhance personalization and appeal through dynamic explanations and\\nmulti-turn dialogues. On the other hand, they might venture into unknown\\nterritory-hallucinating nonexistent items, amplifying bias, or leaking private\\ninformation. Traditional accuracy metrics cannot fully capture these\\nchallenges, as they fail to measure factual correctness, content safety, or\\nalignment with user intent.\\n  This paper makes two main contributions. First, we categorize the evaluation\\nchallenges of Gen-RecSys into two groups: (i) existing concerns that are\\nexacerbated by generative outputs (e.g., bias, privacy) and (ii) entirely new\\nrisks (e.g., item hallucinations, contradictory explanations). Second, we\\npropose a holistic evaluation approach that includes scenario-based assessments\\nand multi-metric checks-incorporating relevance, factual grounding, bias\\ndetection, and policy compliance. Our goal is to provide a guiding framework so\\nresearchers and practitioners can thoroughly assess Gen-RecSys, ensuring\\neffective personalization and responsible deployment.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T08:08:16Z\"}"}
