Making use of techniques from Riemannian\\ngeometry, we prove that any simply connected 3-dimensional contact group not\\nisomorphic to SU(2) satisfies a unique factorization property. As an\\napplication, we develop a method to construct embeddings of 3-dimensional\\nsimply connected contact groups into one among two model tight contact\\nmanifolds.\", \"main_category\": \"math.SG\", \"categories\": \"math.SG,math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:25:46Z\"}"}
