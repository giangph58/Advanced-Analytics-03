While magnetars are a leading candidate for\\nisolated ULPs, several observational properties challenge the established\\nevolutionary framework: (i) low quiescent X-ray luminosities, (ii)\\n$\\\\sim$~hour-long rotational periods, and (iii) highly-variable radio flux. It\\nis shown via magnetothermal modelling that, if electric currents thread the\\nfluid core at the time of crust freezing, the neutron star remains multiband\\nsilent for an initial period of approximately 0.1 Myr while cooling passively.\\nOnce the crust becomes cold enough, the Hall effect begins to dominate the\\nmagnetic evolution, triggering crustal failures that inject magnetospheric\\ntwist that initiates radio pulsing while depleting rotational kinetic energy\\nfrom an already-slow star. Depending on where electric currents circulate, such\\n'late-blooming' magnetars manifesting as Galactic ULPs may thus form a distinct\\nbranch from soft gamma repeaters and anomalous X-ray pulsars.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T16:07:35Z\"}"}
