{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05192v1\", \"title\": \"Long-Term Individual Causal Effect Estimation via Identifiable Latent\\n  Representation Learning\", \"summary\": \"Estimating long-term causal effects by combining long-term observational and\\nshort-term experimental data is a crucial but challenging problem in many\\nreal-world scenarios. In existing methods, several ideal assumptions, e.g.\\nlatent unconfoundedness assumption or additive equi-confounding bias\\nassumption, are proposed to address the latent confounder problem raised by the\\nobservational data. However, in real-world applications, these assumptions are\\ntypically violated which limits their practical effectiveness. In this paper,\\nwe tackle the problem of estimating the long-term individual causal effects\\nwithout the aforementioned assumptions. Specifically, we propose to utilize the\\nnatural heterogeneity of data, such as data from multiple sources, to identify\\nlatent confounders, thereby significantly avoiding reliance on idealized\\nassumptions. Practically, we devise a latent representation learning-based\\nestimator of long-term causal effects. Theoretically, we establish the\\nidentifiability of latent confounders, with which we further achieve long-term\\neffect identification. Extensive experimental studies, conducted on multiple\\nsynthetic and semi-synthetic datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of our\\nproposed method.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T12:42:49Z\"}"}
