{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20470v1\", \"title\": \"The Promises of Multiple Experiments: Identifying Joint Distribution of\\n  Potential Outcomes\", \"summary\": \"Typical causal effects are defined based on the marginal distribution of\\npotential outcomes. However, many real-world applications require causal\\nestimands involving the joint distribution of potential outcomes to enable more\\nnuanced treatment evaluation and selection. In this article, we propose a novel\\nframework for identifying and estimating the joint distribution of potential\\noutcomes using multiple experimental datasets. We introduce the assumption of\\ntransportability of state transition probabilities for potential outcomes\\nacross datasets and establish the identification of the joint distribution\\nunder this assumption, along with a regular full-column rank condition. The key\\nidentification assumptions are testable in an overidentified setting and are\\nanalogous to those in the context of instrumental variables, with the dataset\\nindicator serving as \\\"instrument\\\". Moreover, we propose an easy-to-use\\nleast-squares-based estimator for the joint distribution of potential outcomes\\nin each dataset, proving its consistency and asymptotic normality. We further\\nextend the proposed framework to identify and estimate principal causal\\neffects. We empirically demonstrate the proposed framework by conducting\\nextensive simulations and applying it to evaluate the surrogate endpoint in a\\nreal-world application.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T07:11:25Z\"}"}
