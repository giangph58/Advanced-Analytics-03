{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12833v1\", \"title\": \"Image-Editing Specialists: An RLAIF Approach for Diffusion Models\", \"summary\": \"We present a novel approach to training specialized instruction-based\\nimage-editing diffusion models, addressing key challenges in structural\\npreservation with input images and semantic alignment with user prompts. We\\nintroduce an online reinforcement learning framework that aligns the diffusion\\nmodel with human preferences without relying on extensive human annotations or\\ncurating a large dataset. Our method significantly improves the realism and\\nalignment with instructions in two ways. First, the proposed models achieve\\nprecise and structurally coherent modifications in complex scenes while\\nmaintaining high fidelity in instruction-irrelevant areas. Second, they capture\\nfine nuances in the desired edit by leveraging a visual prompt, enabling\\ndetailed control over visual edits without lengthy textual prompts. This\\napproach simplifies users' efforts to achieve highly specific edits, requiring\\nonly 5 reference images depicting a certain concept for training. Experimental\\nresults demonstrate that our models can perform intricate edits in complex\\nscenes, after just 10 training steps. Finally, we showcase the versatility of\\nour method by applying it to robotics, where enhancing the visual realism of\\nsimulated environments through targeted sim-to-real image edits improves their\\nutility as proxies for real-world settings.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T10:46:39Z\"}"}
