To characterize\\ninter-particle correlation dynamics, we focus on joint properties such as\\ntwo-particle coincidence probabilities and the spread velocity of the\\ninter-particle distance. Regarding spatial modes as an environment for the\\nparticles internal degrees of freedom, we study the role played by the particle\\nstatistics using standard entanglement witnesses, showing that particles\\npossessing fermionic statistics are more resistant to thermalize with their\\nenvironment. We analyze the presence of multipartite entanglement in the\\nsystem's degrees of freedom through the Quantum Fisher Information, revealing\\nthat fermionic states generated during the walk are better suited to perform\\nquantum metrology tasks. Finally, we discuss the potential for implementing\\nthis model using integrated photonic circuits by exploiting $N$-partite\\nentanglement between individual photons.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T11:33:08Z\"}"}
