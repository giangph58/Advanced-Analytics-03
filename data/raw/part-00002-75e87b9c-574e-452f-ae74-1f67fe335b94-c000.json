{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05299v1\", \"title\": \"Hydrodynamic and Electromagnetic Discrepancies between Neutron Star and\\n  Black Hole Spacetimes\", \"summary\": \"The exterior spacetime geometry surrounding an uncharged, spinning black hole\\nin general relativity depends only upon its mass and spin. However, the\\nexterior geometry surrounding any other rotating compact object, for example a\\nneutron star, will generally depend upon higher moments in its multipole\\nexpansion, which will in turn be dependent upon the object's equation of state.\\nUsing general relativistic hydrodynamics and electrodynamics simulations, we\\nillustrate that the presence or absence of these higher moments (assuming a\\nphysically realistic neutron star equation of state) has a significant\\nqualitative effect near the surface of the compact object on the dynamics of\\nunmagnetized accretion, and a smaller quantitative effect on the\\nelectromagnetic field configuration of its magnetosphere. In some places, the\\ndiscrepancies in energy-momentum density are found to reach or exceed 50%, with\\nelectric field strength discrepancies in excess of 10%. We argue that many of\\nthese differences are likely to be amplified by the inclusion of more\\nsophisticated plasma physics models, and are therefore likely to be relevant\\nfor the dynamics of gravitational collapse, and potentially also for particle\\nacceleration and jet launching. These discrepancies suggest important\\nlimitations regarding the use of the Kerr metric when performing numerical\\nsimulations around neutron stars.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:41:36Z\"}"}
