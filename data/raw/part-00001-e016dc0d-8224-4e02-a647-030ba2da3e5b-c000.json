Using the heat kernel technique, we\\ncompute the torsion contributions to the one-loop counterterms in the\\nultraviolet limit. It is found that vectorial and axial components of torsion\\npreserve the qualitative picture of the renormalization group flow of the\\nmetric sector. However, there exists a specific nonminimal kinetic term for the\\npure tensorial (hook-antisymmetric traceless) component of torsion that renders\\nthe gravitational couplings asymptotically free in the absence of tachyons.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T16:56:17Z\"}"}
