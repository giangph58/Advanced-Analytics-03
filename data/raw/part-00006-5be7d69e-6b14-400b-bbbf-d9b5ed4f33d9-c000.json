Here, we present a strategy to actively tune Marangoni-driven\\nself-emulsification at liquid-liquid interfaces by harnessing fluid\\nviscoelasticity. When a water-alcohol droplet spreads on an oil bath, a radial\\nsurface tension gradient induced by selective alcohol evaporation drives an\\ninterfacial instability, leading to the spontaneous formation of a dense\\ntwo-dimensional array of \\\"daughter\\\" droplets. We demonstrate that introducing\\ntrace amounts of high-molecular-weight polymers, which introduces\\nviscoelasticity, provides a robust means of controlling this process.\\nIncreasing viscoelasticity systematically suppresses the instability, resulting\\nin a delayed onset of fragmentation and longer spreading fingers. By combining\\nhigh-resolution experimental visualization and theoretical analysis, we uncover\\na quantitative relationship between the polymer concentration and the finger\\nlength prior to breakup. These findings establish a predictive framework for\\ndesigning viscoelastic interfacial materials with programmable dynamic and\\noffer new opportunities for surface-tension-mediated patterning,\\nemulsification, and fluidic control in soft material systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T09:45:51Z\"}"}
