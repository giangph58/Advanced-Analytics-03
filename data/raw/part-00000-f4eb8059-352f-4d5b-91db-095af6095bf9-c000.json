In this work, we investigate a set of cooling algorithms in\\na simple, solvable fermionic model which allows us to identify the mechanisms\\nwhich underlie the cooling process and, also, those which prevent it. We derive\\nanalytical expressions for the cooling dynamics, steady states, and cooling\\nrates in the weak coupling limit. We find that multi-frequency and randomized\\ncycle strategies can significantly enhance the performance of the quantum\\nalgorithm and circumvent some of the obstacles. We also analyze the effects of\\nnoise and evaluate the conditions under which cooling remains feasible.\\nFurthermore, we present optimized cooling protocols that can significantly\\nenhance cooling performance in the presence of noise. Additionally, we compare\\ncooling and dissipative state preparation and show that, in the model analyzed\\nhere, cooling generally achieves lower energies and is more resilient to noise.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:19:12Z\"}"}
