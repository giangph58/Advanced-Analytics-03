This paper provides the first\\nanalytical study on the stability of the UGKS applied to a linear kinetic\\nmodel, which is able to reproduce the one-dimensional linear scalar\\nadvection-diffusion equation via the Chapman-Enskog expansion method. Adopting\\nperiodic boundary conditions and neglecting the error from numerical\\nintegration, this paper rigorously proves the weighted $L^2$-stability of the\\nfirst-order UGKS under the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) conditions. It is\\nshown that the time step of the method is not constrained by being less than\\nthe particle collision time, nor is it limited by parabolic type CFL conditions\\ntypically applied in solving diffusion equations. The novelty of the proof lies\\nin that based on the ratio of the time step to the particle collision time, the\\nupdate of distribution functions is viewed as a convex combinations of\\nsub-methods related to various physics processes, such as the particle free\\ntransport and collisions. The weighted $L^2$-stability of the sub-methods is\\nobtained by considering them as discretizations to corresponding linear\\nhyperbolic systems and utilizing the associated Riemann invariants. Finally,\\nthe strong stability preserving property of the UGKS leads to the desired\\nweighted $L^2$-stability.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T10:12:07Z\"}"}
