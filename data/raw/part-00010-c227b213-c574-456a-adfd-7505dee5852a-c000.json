The scheme makes use of BACKscattered GAMMas On\\nNucleons (BACKGAMMON). Current accelerator infrastructures could be utilized to\\nproduce the muon beams, such as the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) at Brookhaven\\nNational Laboratory in the United States. We discuss the implementation of\\nBACKGAMMON at the EIC.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.acc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.acc-ph,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T02:57:40Z\"}"}
