We propose a Mood\\nBoard, where users convey abstract concepts with examples that hint at the\\nintended direction of attribute changes. We compute an underlying Mood Space\\nthat 1) factors out irrelevant features and 2) finds the connections between\\nimages, thus bringing relevant concepts closer. We invent a fibration\\ncomputation to compress/decompress pre-trained features into/from a compact\\nspace, 50-100x smaller. The main innovation is learning to mimic the pairwise\\naffinity relationship of the image tokens across exemplars. To focus on the\\ncoarse-to-fine hierarchical structures in the Mood Space, we compute the top\\neigenvector structure from the affinity matrix and define a loss in the\\neigenvector space. The resulting Mood Space is locally linear and compact,\\nallowing image-level operations, such as object averaging, visual analogy, and\\npose transfer, to be performed as a simple vector operation in Mood Space. Our\\nlearning is efficient in computation without any fine-tuning, needs only a few\\n(2-20) exemplars, and takes less than a minute to learn.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T14:49:15Z\"}"}
