Proposing a prescription for the instanton sectors of\\nlinearized gravity and its dual, we show that they may be quantum inequivalent\\nin even dimensions. The duality anomaly is obtained by resolving the dual\\ngraviton theories into vector-valued $p$-form electrodynamics and is controlled\\nby the Reidemeister torsion, Ray-Singer torsion and Euler characteristic of the\\ncotangent bundle. Under the proposed instanton prescription the duality anomaly\\nvanishes for an odd number of spacetime dimensions as a consequence of the\\ncelebrated Cheeger-M\\\\\\\"uller theorem. In the presence of a gravitational\\n$\\\\theta$-term, the partition function is a modular form in direct analogy to\\nAbelian S-duality for Maxwell theory.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,gr-qc,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T15:18:47Z\"}"}
