{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00576v1\", \"title\": \"Narrow Inhomogeneous Distribution and Charge State Stabilization of\\n  Lead-Vacancy Centers in Diamond\", \"summary\": \"Lead-vacancy (PbV) centers in diamond with a large ground state splitting are\\nexpected to be a building block of quantum network nodes. Due to the heaviness\\nof the Pb atom, it is challenging to fabricate high-quality PbV centers with a\\nnarrow inhomogeneous distribution and stable charge state. In this study, for\\nthe formation of the PbV centers, high temperature anneal up to 2300{\\\\deg}C is\\nperformed after Pb ion implantation. At a lower temperature of 1800{\\\\deg}C, the\\nPbV centers show a large inhomogeneous distribution and spectral diffusion,\\nwhile higher temperatures of 2200-2300{\\\\deg}C leads to narrow inhomogeneous\\ndistributions with standard deviations of ~5 GHz. The charge state transition\\nof the PbV centers formed at 2200{\\\\deg}C occurs by capturing photo-carriers\\ngenerated from surrounding defects under 532 nm laser irradiation. Finally,\\nmultiple stable PbV centers with nearly identical photon frequencies are\\nobtained, which is essential for applications in quantum information\\nprocessing.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T15:02:10Z\"}"}
