Yet, current laser-driven systems typically support only\\nsingle-modality imaging, require complex infrastructure, or operate at low\\nrepetition rates. Here, we demonstrate a compact, table-top laser-plasma source\\ncapable of generating synchronized electron and X-ray pulses at 1 kHz using\\njust 2 mJ per pulse. A structured methanol droplet target enables\\nquasi-single-shot electron radiographs and broadband, energy-resolved X-ray\\nimages, facilitating bi-modal imaging of both metallic and biological\\nspecimens. We achieve resolutions of 13.6 um for electrons and 21 um for\\nX-rays, and demonstrate tomographic reconstruction using 35 projections. This\\ncompact platform rivals large-scale petawatt systems in resolution and\\nbrightness, while remaining scalable and accessible for high-throughput imaging\\nin materials science and biomedicine.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,physics.app-ph,physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T13:52:58Z\"}"}
