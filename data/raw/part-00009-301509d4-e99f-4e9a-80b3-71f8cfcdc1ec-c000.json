Deep learning has become\\na viable alternative for quickly generating high-quality solutions,\\nparticularly when metaheuristics underperform. In recent years,\\nquantum-inspired approaches such as tensor networks have shown promise in\\naddressing these challenges. Despite these advancements, a thorough comparison\\nof the different paradigms is missing. This study evaluates eight algorithms on\\nWeighted Max-Cut graphs ranging from 10 to 250 nodes. Specifically, we compare\\na Genetic Algorithm representing metaheuristics, a Graph Neural Network for\\ndeep learning, and the Density Matrix Renormalization Group as a tensor network\\napproach. Our analysis focuses on solution quality and computational efficiency\\n(i.e., time and memory usage). Numerical results show that the Genetic\\nAlgorithm achieves near-optimal results for small graphs, although its\\ncomputation time grows significantly with problem size. The Graph Neural\\nNetwork offers a balanced solution for medium-sized instances with low memory\\ndemands and rapid inference, yet it exhibits more significant variability on\\nlarger graphs. Meanwhile, the Tensor Network approach consistently yields high\\napproximation ratios and efficient execution on larger graphs, albeit with\\nincreased memory consumption.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.ET\", \"categories\": \"cs.ET\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:51:49Z\"}"}
