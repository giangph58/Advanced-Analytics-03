We demonstrate how the DM halo modifies the\\ngravitational dynamics of the black hole, influencing the energy and angular\\nmomentum of timelike particle geodesics and enhancing their interaction with\\nthe BH. We determine the radii of the marginally bound orbits (MBOs) and\\ninnermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs), showing that the DM halo increases\\nboth. This provides a deeper understanding of how the DM alters the behavior,\\nenergy, and angular momentum of timelike particle geodesics. Furthermore, we\\nexplore the gravitational waveforms emitted by a timelike particle in periodic\\norbits around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) within this BH-DM system. Using\\na semi-analytical approach, we calculate particle trajectories and derive the\\ncorresponding waveforms, demonstrating that the DM halo modifies the zoom-whirl\\norbital behavior, leading to distinct changes in the waveform structure. Our\\nfindings suggest that future gravitational wave (GW) observations could\\nconstrain the properties of DM halos surrounding BHs, providing new insights\\ninto the gravitational wave signatures arising from the interaction between BH\\ngravity and DM.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T16:20:10Z\"}"}
