Incompatibility with the thermal and lithography process\\nrequirements for gated silicon transistor manufacturing have inhibited\\nexploration of both how APAM can enhance CMOS performance, and how transistor\\nmanufacturing steps can accelerate the discovery of new APAM device concepts.\\nIn this work, we introduce an APAM process that enables direct integration into\\nthe middle of a transistor manufacturing workflow. We show that a process that\\ncombines sputtering and annealing with a hardmask preserves a defining\\ncharacteristic of APAM, a doping density far in excess of the solid solubility\\nlimit, while trading another, the atomic precision, for compatibility with\\nmanufacturing. The electrical characteristics of a chip combining a transistor\\nwith an APAM resistor show the APAM module has only affected the transistor\\nthrough the addition of a resistance, and not by altering the transistor. This\\nproof-of-concept demonstration also outlines the requirements and limitations\\nof a unified APAM tool which could be introduced into manufacturing\\nenvironments, greatly expanding access to this technology, and inspiring a new\\ngeneration of devices with it.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.app-ph,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:18:54Z\"}"}
