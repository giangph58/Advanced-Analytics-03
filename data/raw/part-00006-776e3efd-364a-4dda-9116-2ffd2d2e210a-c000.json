We first prove a basic decorrelation inequality for events\\ndepending on the state of the field on distinct boxes. We then show that in all\\nrelevant dimensions, the vacant set undergoes a nontrivial phase transition\\nregarding the existence of an infinite connected component. Finally we obtain\\nthe Gumbel fluctuations for the cover level of finite sets, which is analogous\\nto Belius' result in the setting of Random Interlacements.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T07:46:21Z\"}"}
