{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00660v1\", \"title\": \"AI-based CSI Feedback with Digital Twins: Real-World Validation and\\n  Insights\", \"summary\": \"Deep learning (DL) has shown great potential for enhancing channel state\\ninformation (CSI) feedback in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)\\ncommunication systems, a subject currently under study by the 3GPP standards\\nbody. Digital twins (DTs) have emerged as an effective means to generate\\nsite-specific datasets for training DL-based CSI feedback models. However, most\\nexisting studies rely solely on simulations, leaving the effectiveness of DTs\\nin reducing DL training costs yet to be validated through realistic\\nexperimental setups. This paper addresses this gap by establishing a real-world\\n(RW) environment and corresponding virtual channels using ray tracing with\\nreplicated 3D models and accurate antenna properties. We evaluate whether\\nmodels trained in DT environments can effectively operate in RW scenarios and\\nquantify the benefits of online learning (OL) for performance enhancement.\\nResults show that a dedicated DT remains essential even with OL to achieve\\nsatisfactory performance in RW scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,eess.SP,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T17:02:22Z\"}"}
