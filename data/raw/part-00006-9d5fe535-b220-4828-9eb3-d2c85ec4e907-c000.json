For any integer $k\\\\ge2$, an edge coloring of\\nthe complete $k$-graph $K_n^{(k)}$ is said to be a $(p,q)$-coloring if every\\ncopy of $K_p^{(k)}$ receives at least $q$ colors. The Erd\\\\H{o}s-Gy\\\\'{a}rf\\\\'{a}s\\nfunction $f_k(n,p,q)$ is the minimum number of colors that are needed for\\n$K_n^{(k)}$ to have a $(p,q)$-coloring.\\n  Conlon, Fox, Lee and Sudakov (\\\\emph{IMRN, 2015}) conjectured that for any\\npositive integers $p, k$ and $i$ with $k\\\\ge3$ and $1\\\\le i<k$,\\n$f_k(n,p,{{p-i}\\\\choose{k-i}})=(\\\\log_{(i-1)}n)^{o(1)}$, where $\\\\log_{(i)}n$ is\\nan iterated $i$-fold logarithm in $n$. It has been verified to be true for\\n$k=3, p=4, i=1$ by Conlon et. al (\\\\emph{IMRN, 2015}), for $k=3, p=5, i=2$ by\\nMubayi (\\\\emph{JGT, 2016}), and for all $k\\\\ge 4, p=k+1,i=1$ by B. Janzer and O.\\nJanzer (\\\\emph{JCTB, 2024}). In this paper, we give new constructions and show\\nthat this conjecture holds for infinitely many new cases, i.e., it holds for\\nall $k\\\\ge4$, $p=k+2$ and $i=k-1$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T03:49:05Z\"}"}
