In this work, we extend the scope to address quantum advantage in tasks\\nrelevant to chemistry and physics. Specifically, we consider the unitary\\ncluster Jastrow (UCJ) ansatz-a variant of the unitary coupled cluster ansatz,\\nwhich is widely used to solve the electronic structure problem on quantum\\ncomputers-to show that sampling from the output distributions of quantum\\ncircuits implementing the UCJ ansatz is likely to be classically hard. More\\nspecifically, we show that there exist UCJ circuits for which classical\\nsimulation of sampling cannot be performed in polynomial time, under a\\nreasonable complexity-theoretical assumption that the polynomial hierarchy does\\nnot collapse. Our main contribution is to show that a class of UCJ circuits can\\nbe used to perform arbitrary instantaneous quantum polynomial-time (IQP)\\ncomputations, which are already known to be classically hard to simulate under\\nthe same complexity assumption. As a side result, we also show that UCJ\\nequipped with post-selection can generate the class post-BQP. Our\\ndemonstration, worst-case nonsimulatability of UCJ, would potentially imply\\nquantum advantage in quantum algorithms for chemistry and physics using unitary\\ncoupled cluster type ansatzes, such as the variational quantum eigensolver and\\nquantum-selected configuration interaction.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T12:34:33Z\"}"}
