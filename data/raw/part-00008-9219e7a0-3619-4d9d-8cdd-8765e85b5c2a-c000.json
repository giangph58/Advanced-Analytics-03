However, the existing computational toolbox is still in need of\\nmethods and models attuned to the specific challenges and goals of social and\\npolitical inquiry. In this article, we introduce a visual Structural Topic\\nModel (vSTM) that combines pretrained image embeddings with a structural topic\\nmodel. This has important advantages compared to existing approaches. First,\\npretrained embeddings allow the model to capture the semantic complexity of\\nimages relevant to political contexts. Second, the structural topic model\\nprovides the ability to analyze how topics and covariates are related, while\\nmaintaining a nuanced representation of images as a mixture of multiple topics.\\nIn our empirical application, we show that the vSTM is able to identify topics\\nthat are interpretable, coherent, and substantively relevant to the study of\\nonline political communication.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.CY,stat.AP,stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:07:11Z\"}"}
