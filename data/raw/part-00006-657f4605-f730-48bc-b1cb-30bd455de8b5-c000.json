It has a wide range of application domains. This paper introduces the\\nTensor-Core Beamformer: a generic, optimized beamformer library that harnesses\\nthe computational power of GPU tensor cores to accelerate beamforming\\ncomputations. The library hides the complexity of tensor cores from the user,\\nand supports 16-bit and 1-bit precision. An extensive performance evaluation on\\nNVIDIA and AMD GPUs shows that the library outperforms traditional beamforming\\non regular GPU cores by a wide margin, at much higher energy efficiency. In the\\n16-bit mode, it achieves over 600 TeraOps/s on an AMD MI300X GPU, while\\napproaching 1 TeraOp/J. In the 1-bit mode, it breaks the 3 PetaOps/s barrier\\nand achieves over 10 TeraOps/J on an NVIDIA A100 GPU. The beamforming library\\ncan be easily integrated into existing pipelines. We demonstrate its use for\\nmedical ultrasound and radio-astronomical instruments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC,astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:00:38Z\"}"}
