These sampling algorithms\\ninclude Metropolis-Hastings Monte Carlo, Wang-Landau sampling, and Nested\\nSampling. We demonstrate the capabilities of the package by applying it to some\\nprototypical binary and multicomponent alloys, including high-entropy alloys.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.comp-ph,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T16:28:20Z\"}"}
