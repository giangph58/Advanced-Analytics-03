Our paper harnesses Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate\\nvalue-added analysis, a qualitative process analysis technique that aims to\\nidentify steps in the process that do not deliver value. To date, this\\ntechnique is predominantly manual, time-consuming, and subjective. Our method\\noffers a more principled approach which operates in two phases: first,\\ndecomposing high-level activities into detailed steps to enable granular\\nanalysis, and second, performing a value-added analysis to classify each step\\naccording to Lean principles. This approach enables systematic identification\\nof waste while maintaining the semantic understanding necessary for qualitative\\nanalysis. We develop our approach using 50 business process models, for which\\nwe collect and publish manual ground-truth labels. Our evaluation, comparing\\nzero-shot baselines with more structured prompts reveals (a) a consistent\\nbenefit of structured prompting and (b) promising performance for both tasks.\\nWe discuss the potential for LLMs to augment human expertise in qualitative\\nprocess analysis while reducing the time and subjectivity inherent in manual\\napproaches.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI,cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T05:52:50Z\"}"}
