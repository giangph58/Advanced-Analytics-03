{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12620v1\", \"title\": \"Fractional balanced chromatic number of signed subcubic graphs\", \"summary\": \"A signed graph is a pair $(G,\\\\sigma)$, where $G$ is a graph and $\\\\sigma:\\nE(G)\\\\rightarrow \\\\{-, +\\\\}$, called signature, is an assignment of signs to the\\nedges. Given a signed graph $(G,\\\\sigma)$ with no negative loops, a balanced\\n$(p,q)$-coloring of $(G,\\\\sigma)$ is an assignment $f$ of $q$ colors to each\\nvertex from a pool of $p$ colors such that each color class induces a balanced\\nsubgraph, i.e., no negative cycles. Let $(K_4,-)$ be the signed graph on $K_4$\\nwith all edges being negative. In this work, we show that every signed (simple)\\nsubcubic graph admits a balanced $(5,3)$-coloring except for $(K_4,-)$ and\\nsigned graphs switching equivalent to it. For this particular signed graph the\\nbest balanced colorings are $(2p,p)$-colorings.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T03:51:29Z\"}"}
