We establish the existence of an action ground state when\\nthe size of the loop is either very small or very large. Our analysis relies on\\nvariational arguments, such as profile decomposition. When it exists, we study\\nthe shape of the ground state using ordinary differential equations arguments,\\nsuch as the study of period functions. The theoretical results are completed\\nwith a numerical study.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:54:36Z\"}"}
