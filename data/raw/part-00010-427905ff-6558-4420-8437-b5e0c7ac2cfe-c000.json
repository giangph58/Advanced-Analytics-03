{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04543v1\", \"title\": \"New bounds for proper $h$-conflict-free colourings\", \"summary\": \"A proper $k$-colouring of a graph $G$ is called $h$-conflict-free if every\\nvertex $v$ has at least $\\\\min\\\\, \\\\{h, {\\\\rm deg}(v)\\\\}$ colours appearing exactly\\nonce in its neighbourhood. Let $\\\\chi_{\\\\rm pcf}^h(G)$ denote the minimum $k$\\nsuch that such a colouring exists. We show that for every fixed $h\\\\ge 1$, every\\ngraph $G$ of maximum degree $\\\\Delta$ satisfies $\\\\chi_{\\\\rm pcf}^h(G) \\\\le h\\\\Delta\\n+ \\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\log \\\\Delta)$. This expands on the work of Cho et al., and\\nimproves a recent result of Liu and Reed in the case $h=1$. We conjecture that\\nfor every $h\\\\ge 1$ and every graph $G$ of maximum degree $\\\\Delta$ sufficiently\\nlarge, the bound $\\\\chi_{\\\\rm pcf}^h(G) \\\\le h\\\\Delta + 1$ should hold, which would\\nbe tight. When the minimum degree $\\\\delta$ of $G$ is sufficiently large, namely\\n$\\\\delta \\\\ge \\\\max\\\\{100h, 3000\\\\log \\\\Delta\\\\}$, we show that this upper bound can\\nbe further reduced to $\\\\chi_{\\\\rm{pcf}}^h(G) \\\\le \\\\Delta +\\n\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\sqrt{h\\\\Delta})$. This improves a recent bound from Kamyczura and\\nPrzyby{\\\\l}o when $\\\\delta \\\\le \\\\sqrt{h\\\\Delta}$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,cs.DM\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T16:25:12Z\"}"}
