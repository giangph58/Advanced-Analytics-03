The hole was fabricated using\\nanisotropic etching of a silicon substrate and was designed to minimize\\npotential distortion in the trapping region. By introducing the atomic beam\\nthrough the hole, we achieved enhanced isotope selectivity and experimentally\\ndemonstrated the selective trapping of calcium isotope ions using an atomic\\noven. We successfully prepared isotope ion pairs directly from the oven via\\nsympathetic cooling at a rate comparable to that achieved using ablation\\nloading. The sympathetic cooling process occurred on the order of a few\\nseconds. We demonstrated the direct generation of an ion chain above the\\nthrough-hole. This approach can be applied for trapping a wide range of ion\\nspecies using a remarkably simple experimental setup, making it desirable for\\nseveral applications such as quantum-charge-coupled-device (QCCD) architectures\\nand precision measurements of isotope shifts.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T07:12:43Z\"}"}
