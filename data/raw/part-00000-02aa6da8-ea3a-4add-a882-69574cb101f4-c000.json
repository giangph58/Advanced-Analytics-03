{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05322v1\", \"title\": \"The Emergence of Little Red Dots from Binary Massive Black Holes\", \"summary\": \"Little red dots (LRDs) are a newly identified class of broad-line active\\ngalactic nuclei (AGN) with a distinctive v-shape spectrum characterized by red\\noptical and blue UV continuum emission. Their high abundance at redshifts of\\n$z\\\\sim6-8$ and decline at lower redshifts suggest a transient origin. We\\npropose that the spectral shape of LRDs originates from compact binary black\\nhole systems, where each black hole is surrounded by a mini-disk and embedded\\nin a larger circum-binary disk. With a binary separation of $\\\\lesssim 10^3$\\nSchwarzschild radii, the Wien tail of a $T\\\\simeq 5000~{\\\\rm K}$ blackbody\\nspectrum at the inner edge of the circum-binary disk produces the red optical\\nemission, while the mini-disks power the UV continuum. Binary torques carve out\\na gap between the circum-binary disk and mini-disks, setting the turnover\\nwavelength of the v-shaped spectrum around the Balmer limit. This scenario\\nnaturally reproduces LRD spectra requiring only modest dust attenuation\\n($A_V\\\\lesssim 1$ mag), resolving overestimated luminosities for LRDs in\\nprevious studies and alleviating a tension with the so-called Soltan argument.\\nThis model predicts a distinct spectral evolution as the binary orbit decays\\nthrough binary-disk interactions and gravitational waves (GWs), linking\\nearly-stage \\\"proto-LRD\\\" binaries to the broader AGN population and late-stage\\n\\\"LRD-descendants\\\" to coalescing binaries detectable in GW experiments.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:08:46Z\"}"}
