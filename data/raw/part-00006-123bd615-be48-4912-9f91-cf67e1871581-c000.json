{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10836v1\", \"title\": \"Uplink Assisted Joint Channel Estimation and CSI Feedback: An Approach\\n  Based on Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding\", \"summary\": \"In frequency division duplex (FDD) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)\\nwireless communication systems, the acquisition of downlink channel state\\ninformation (CSI) is essential for maximizing spatial resource utilization and\\nimproving system spectral efficiency. The separate design of modules in\\nAI-based CSI feedback architectures under traditional modular communication\\nframeworks, including channel estimation (CE), CSI compression and feedback,\\nleads to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose an uplink assisted\\njoint CE and and CSI feedback approach via deep learning for downlink CSI\\nacquisition, which mitigates performance degradation caused by distribution\\nbias across separately trained modules in traditional modular communication\\nframeworks. The proposed network adopts a deep joint source-channel coding\\n(DJSCC) architecture to mitigate the cliff effect encountered in the\\nconventional separate source-channel coding. Furthermore, we exploit the uplink\\nCSI as auxiliary information to enhance CSI reconstruction accuracy by\\nleveraging the partial reciprocity between the uplink and downlink channels in\\nFDD systems, without introducing additional overhead. The effectiveness of\\nuplink CSI as assisted information and the necessity of an end-toend\\nmulti-module joint training architecture is validated through comprehensive\\nablation and scalability experiments.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T03:29:24Z\"}"}
