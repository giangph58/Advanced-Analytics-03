{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02339v1\", \"title\": \"Riemannian Optimization for Sparse Tensor CCA\", \"summary\": \"Tensor canonical correlation analysis (TCCA) has received significant\\nattention due to its ability to effectively preserve the geometric structure of\\nhigh-order data. However, existing methods generally rely on tensor\\ndecomposition techniques with high computational complexity, which severely\\nlimits their application in large-scale datasets. In this paper, a modified\\nmethod, TCCA-L, is proposed, which integrates sparse regularization and\\nLaplacian regularization. An alternating manifold proximal gradient algorithm\\nis designed based on Riemannian manifold theory. The algorithm avoids the\\ntraditional tensor decomposition and combines with the semi-smooth Newton\\nalgorithm to solve the subproblem, thus significantly improving the\\ncomputational efficiency. Furthermore, the global convergence of the sequence\\ngenerated by the algorithm is established, providing a solid theoretical\\nfoundation for its convergence. Numerical experiments demonstrate that TCCA-L\\noutperforms traditional methods in both classification accuracy and running\\ntime.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T07:19:14Z\"}"}
