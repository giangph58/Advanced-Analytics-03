{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21541v1\", \"title\": \"Lights Out, Stress In: Assessing Stress Amidst Power and Energy\\n  Challenges in Bangladesh\", \"summary\": \"This study examines the psychological impact of energy crises on households,\\nutilising the Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10) to measure the stress induced\\nby disruptions in electricity, gas, and fuel supply and pricing. Through a\\nmultivariate analysis incorporating Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression,\\nSimultaneous-Quantile Regressions (SQR), Random Forest (RF) and Ordered Probit\\nmodels, the research identifies the key socio-demographic and environmental\\nfactors influencing household stress. Our findings reveal that urban residency,\\nlow-income households, older individuals, and those with low environmental\\nawareness are particularly vulnerable to stress during energy crises. Regional\\ndisparities and attitudes towards nuclear and renewable energy also\\nsignificantly shape stress responses. The study emphasises the need for\\npsychologically-informed energy policy, advocating for the inclusion of stress\\nmetrics in energy planning to enhance resilience and address the\\nmulti-dimensional nature of energy insecurity. This research contributes a\\nnovel, human-centric perspective to energy policy, urging policymakers to\\nintegrate psychosocial resilience alongside traditional technical and economic\\nconsiderations in the design of energy interventions.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T11:36:37Z\"}"}
