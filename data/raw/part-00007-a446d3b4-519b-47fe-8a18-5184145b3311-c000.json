{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12651v1\", \"title\": \"Feature selection based on cluster assumption in PU learning\", \"summary\": \"Feature selection is essential for efficient data mining and sometimes\\nencounters the positive-unlabeled (PU) learning scenario, where only a few\\npositive labels are available, while most data remains unlabeled. In certain\\nreal-world PU learning tasks, data subjected to adequate feature selection\\noften form clusters with concentrated positive labels. Conventional feature\\nselection methods that treat unlabeled data as negative may fail to capture the\\nstatistical characteristics of positive data in such scenarios, leading to\\nsuboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a novel feature selection\\nmethod based on the cluster assumption in PU learning, called FSCPU. FSCPU\\nformulates the feature selection problem as a binary optimization task, with an\\nobjective function explicitly designed to incorporate the cluster assumption in\\nthe PU learning setting. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate the\\neffectiveness of FSCPU across various data conditions. Moreover, comparisons\\nwith 10 conventional algorithms on three open datasets show that FSCPU achieves\\ncompetitive performance in downstream classification tasks, even when the\\ncluster assumption does not strictly hold.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.NE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T05:22:17Z\"}"}
