{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11316v1\", \"title\": \"Role of Matter Inhomogeneity on Fast Flavor Conversion of Supernova\\n  Neutrinos\", \"summary\": \"We investigated the impact of a spatially varying matter potential $\\\\lambda$,\\ncoming from neutrino-electron forward scattering, on the emergence of fast\\nneutrino flavor conversion (FFC) triggered by the presence of zero crossings in\\nthe angular distribution of the neutrino electron lepton number (ELN). We find\\nthat FFC can be significantly affected as the spatial variation rate of\\n$\\\\lambda$ increases, and strong spatial variations can completely stabilize\\ninitially unstable systems. Using stability analysis based solely on initial\\nconditions, we identified for the first time a critical variation rate above\\nwhich no FFC occurs even if the flavor instability exists. By analyzing several\\nrepresentative matter profiles based on an 18 $M_{\\\\odot}$ SN model, we show\\nthat spatially inhomogeneous $\\\\lambda$ can suppress the occurrence of FFC\\nassociated with shallow ELN zero crossings in most of the SN's radial region,\\nespecially during the accretion phase. Our finding highlights the need to\\nconsider the impact of matter inhomogeneity in the development of improved SN\\nmodels that aim to include the effect of neutrino flavor conversions.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.SR,hep-ph,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:56:26Z\"}"}
