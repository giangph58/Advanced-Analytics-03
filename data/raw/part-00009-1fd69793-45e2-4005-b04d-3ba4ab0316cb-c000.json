{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02298v1\", \"title\": \"SPACE: SPike-Aware Consistency Enhancement for Test-Time Adaptation in\\n  Spiking Neural Networks\", \"summary\": \"Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), as a biologically plausible alternative to\\nArtificial Neural Networks (ANNs), have demonstrated advantages in terms of\\nenergy efficiency, temporal processing, and biological plausibility. However,\\nSNNs are highly sensitive to distribution shifts, which can significantly\\ndegrade their performance in real-world scenarios. Traditional test-time\\nadaptation (TTA) methods designed for ANNs often fail to address the unique\\ncomputational dynamics of SNNs, such as sparsity and temporal spiking behavior.\\nTo address these challenges, we propose $\\\\textbf{SP}$ike-$\\\\textbf{A}$ware\\n$\\\\textbf{C}$onsistency $\\\\textbf{E}$nhancement (SPACE), the first source-free\\nand single-instance TTA method specifically designed for SNNs. SPACE leverages\\nthe inherent spike dynamics of SNNs to maximize the consistency of\\nspike-behavior-based local feature maps across augmented versions of a single\\ntest sample, enabling robust adaptation without requiring source data. We\\nevaluate SPACE on multiple datasets, including CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C,\\nTiny-ImageNet-C and DVS Gesture-C. Furthermore, SPACE demonstrates strong\\ngeneralization across different model architectures, achieving consistent\\nperformance improvements on both VGG9 and ResNet11. Experimental results show\\nthat SPACE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness\\nand robustness in real-world settings.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T06:05:05Z\"}"}
