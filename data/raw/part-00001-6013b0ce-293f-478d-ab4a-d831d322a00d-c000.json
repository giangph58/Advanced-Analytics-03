We\\nconsidered NC modifications to spacetime geometry based on de Sitter gauge\\ntheory of gravity and calculate their impact on tidal deformability. While\\nseveral types of compact objects have been proposed as candidates for probing\\nspacetime non-commutativity, particularly at the horizon scales, our study\\nshowed analytically that, for compact objects with non-singular metric at their\\nsurface (such as neutron stars and boson stars), the NC correction to their\\ntidal deformability converge to a finite value at the black-hole-compactness\\nlimit, eliminating infinite enhancement at the horizon scales. We then compute\\nthe NC corrections for neutron stars and boson stars, considering several\\ndifferent models, and analyze their imprints on the GW signals. By comparing\\nthe results, we assess the scale of NC effects across different compactness\\nregimes and discuss the conditions under which these NC effects can be\\namplified. While our findings suggest that the leading-order NC correction\\ndominates the tidal deformability of a compact object near the\\nblack-hole-compactness limit, we demonstrate that neutron stars and boson stars\\nare not viable candidates to constrain spacetime non-commutativity, while\\nrelying on the tidal deformability through GW observations.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.HE,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T12:57:48Z\"}"}
