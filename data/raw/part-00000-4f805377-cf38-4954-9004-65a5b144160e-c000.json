By encoding each cell with two single-transistor-based multi-level\\ncell (MLC) memory elements, such as ferroelectric field-effect transistors\\n(FeFETs), and mapping a pixel's temporal sequence onto consecutive word lines\\n(WLs), we enable direct temporal pattern detection within NAND strings. Each\\nNAND string serves as a dedicated reference for a single pixel, while different\\nblocks store patterns for distinct pixels, allowing large-scale\\nspatial-temporal pattern recognition via simple direct bit-line (BL) sensing, a\\nwell-established operation in vertical NAND storage. We experimentally validate\\nour approach at both the cell and array levels, demonstrating that vertical\\nNAND-based detector achieves more than six orders of magnitude improvement in\\nenergy efficiency and more than three orders of magnitude reduction in latency\\ncompared to conventional CPU-based methods. These findings establish vertical\\nNAND storage as a scalable and energy-efficient solution for next-generation\\nneuromorphic vision processing.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.ET\", \"categories\": \"cs.ET\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T03:34:29Z\"}"}
