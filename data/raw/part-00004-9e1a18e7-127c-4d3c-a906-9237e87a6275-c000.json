Using an asymptotic\\nKodama-Fokas-Liu near-identity transformation, we map the eKdV equation to the\\nGardner equation. This improved Gardner equation has a different cubic\\nnonlinearity coefficient and an additional transport term compared to the\\nfrequently used truncated Gardner equation. We then construct approximate\\nsolitary and cnoidal wave solutions of the eKdV equation using this mapping and\\ntest validity and performance of these approximations, as well as performance\\nof the truncated and improved Gardner and eKdV equations, by comparison with\\ndirect numerical simulations of the strongly-nonlinear two-layer long-wave\\nparent system in the absence of currents.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn,nlin.PS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T11:06:07Z\"}"}
