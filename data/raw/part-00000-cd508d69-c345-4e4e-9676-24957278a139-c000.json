{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06247v1\", \"title\": \"The Resolved Structure of a Low Metallicity Photodissociation Region\", \"summary\": \"Photodissociation Regions (PDRs) are key to understanding the feedback\\nprocesses that shape interstellar matter in galaxies. One important type of PDR\\nis the interface between HII regions and molecular clouds, where\\nfar-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation from massive stars heats gas and dissociates\\nmolecules. Photochemical models predict that the C/CO transition occurs deeper\\nin the PDR compared to the H/H2 transition in low-metallicity environments,\\nincreasing the extent of CO-dark H2 gas. This prediction has been difficult to\\ntest outside the Milky Way due to the lack of high spatial resolution\\nobservations tracing H2 and CO. This study examines a low-metallicity PDR in\\nthe N13 region of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) where we spatially resolve\\nthe ionization front, the H2 dissociation front, and the C/CO transition using\\n12CO J=2-1, 3-2 and [CI] (1-0) observations from the Atacama Large\\nMillimeter/sub-mm Array (ALMA) and near-infrared spectroscopy of H2 vibrational\\nlines from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Our analysis shows that the\\nseparation between the H/H2 and C/CO boundaries is approximately 0.043 +-\\n0.013(stat.) +- 0.0036(syst.) pc (equivalent to 0.\\\"146 +- 0.\\\"042 (stat.) +-\\n0.\\\"012 (syst.) at the SMC's distance of 62 kpc), defining the spatial extent of\\nthe CO-dark H2 region. Compared to our plane-parallel PDR models, we find that\\na constant pressure model matches the observed structure better than a constant\\ndensity one. Overall, we find that the PDR model does well at predicting the\\nextent of the CO-dark H2 layer in N13. This study represents the first resolved\\nbenchmark for low metallicity PDRs.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T17:49:33Z\"}"}
