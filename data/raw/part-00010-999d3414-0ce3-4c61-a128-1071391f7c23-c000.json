We establish well-posedness results, the existence and the\\nuniqueness, of CRFs in both Euclidean and hyperbolic background geometries.\\nMoreover, we prove convergence results of CRFs, which indicate a uniformization\\ntheorem for CRFs on infinite disk triangulations. As an application, we prove\\nan existence result of circle-packing metrics with infinite prescribed cone\\nangles in hyperbolic background geometry. To our knowledge, these are the first\\nresults of CRFs on infinite triangulations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GT\", \"categories\": \"math.GT,math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T08:58:26Z\"}"}
