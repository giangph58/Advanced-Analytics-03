{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05153v1\", \"title\": \"Day-Ahead Bidding Strategies for Wind Farm Operators under a One-Price\\n  Balancing Scheme\", \"summary\": \"We study day-ahead bidding strategies for wind farm operators under a\\none-price balancing scheme, prevalent in European electricity markets. In this\\nsetting, the profit-maximising strategy becomes an all-or-nothing strategy,\\naiming to take advantage of open positions in the balancing market. However,\\nbalancing prices are difficult, if not impossible, to forecast in the day-ahead\\nstage and large open positions can affect the balancing price by changing the\\ndirection of the system imbalance. This paper addresses day-ahead bidding as a\\ndecision-making problem under uncertainty, with the objective of maximising the\\nexpected profit while reducing the imbalance risk related to the strategy. To\\nthis end, we develop a stochastic optimisation problem with explicit\\nconstraints on the positions in the balancing market, providing risk\\ncertificates, and derive an analytical solution to this problem. Moreover, we\\nshow how the price-impact of the trading strategy on the balancing market can\\nbe included in the ex-post evaluation. Using real data from the Belgian\\nelectricity market and an offshore wind farm in the North Sea, we demonstrate\\nthat the all-or-nothing strategy negatively impacts the balancing price,\\nresulting in long-term losses for the wind farm. Our risk-constrained strategy,\\nhowever, can still significantly enhance operational profit compared to\\ntraditional point-forecast bidding.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T11:50:19Z\"}"}
