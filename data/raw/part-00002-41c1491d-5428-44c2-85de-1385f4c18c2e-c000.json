{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14861v1\", \"title\": \"Stitching Inner Product and Euclidean Metrics for Topology-aware Maximum\\n  Inner Product Search\", \"summary\": \"Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) is a fundamental challenge in machine\\nlearning and information retrieval, particularly in high-dimensional data\\napplications. Existing approaches to MIPS either rely solely on Inner Product\\n(IP) similarity, which faces issues with local optima and redundant\\ncomputations, or reduce the MIPS problem to the Nearest Neighbor Search under\\nthe Euclidean metric via space projection, leading to topology destruction and\\ninformation loss. Despite the divergence of the two paradigms, we argue that\\nthere is no inherent binary opposition between IP and Euclidean metrics. By\\nstitching IP and Euclidean in the design of indexing and search algorithms, we\\ncan significantly enhance MIPS performance. Specifically, this paper explores\\nthe theoretical and empirical connections between these two metrics from the\\nMIPS perspective. Our investigation, grounded in graph-based search, reveals\\nthat different indexing and search strategies offer distinct advantages for\\nMIPS, depending on the underlying data topology. Building on these insights, we\\nintroduce a novel graph-based index called Metric-Amphibious Graph (MAG) and a\\ncorresponding search algorithm, Adaptive Navigation with Metric Switch (ANMS).\\nTo facilitate parameter tuning for optimal performance, we identify three\\nstatistical indicators that capture essential data topology properties and\\ncorrelate strongly with parameter tuning. Extensive experiments on 12\\nreal-world datasets demonstrate that MAG outperforms existing state-of-the-art\\nmethods, achieving up to 4x search speedup while maintaining adaptability and\\nscalability.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DB\", \"categories\": \"cs.DB,cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T05:01:58Z\"}"}
