{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16454v1\", \"title\": \"Killing Two Birds with One Stone: Unifying Retrieval and Ranking with a\\n  Single Generative Recommendation Model\", \"summary\": \"In recommendation systems, the traditional multi-stage paradigm, which\\nincludes retrieval and ranking, often suffers from information loss between\\nstages and diminishes performance. Recent advances in generative models,\\ninspired by natural language processing, suggest the potential for unifying\\nthese stages to mitigate such loss. This paper presents the Unified Generative\\nRecommendation Framework (UniGRF), a novel approach that integrates retrieval\\nand ranking into a single generative model. By treating both stages as sequence\\ngeneration tasks, UniGRF enables sufficient information sharing without\\nadditional computational costs, while remaining model-agnostic. To enhance\\ninter-stage collaboration, UniGRF introduces a ranking-driven enhancer module\\nthat leverages the precision of the ranking stage to refine retrieval\\nprocesses, creating an enhancement loop. Besides, a gradient-guided adaptive\\nweighter is incorporated to dynamically balance the optimization of retrieval\\nand ranking, ensuring synchronized performance improvements. Extensive\\nexperiments demonstrate that UniGRF significantly outperforms existing models\\non benchmark datasets, confirming its effectiveness in facilitating information\\ntransfer. Ablation studies and further experiments reveal that UniGRF not only\\npromotes efficient collaboration between stages but also achieves synchronized\\noptimization. UniGRF provides an effective, scalable, and compatible framework\\nfor generative recommendation systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T06:43:54Z\"}"}
