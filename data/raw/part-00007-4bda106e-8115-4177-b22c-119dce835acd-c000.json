{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01604v1\", \"title\": \"SpikeSift: A Computationally Efficient and Drift-Resilient Spike Sorting\\n  Algorithm\", \"summary\": \"Spike sorting is a fundamental step in analyzing extracellular recordings,\\nenabling the isolation of individual neuronal activity, yet it remains a\\nchallenging problem due to overlapping signals and recording instabilities,\\nincluding electrode drift. While numerous algorithms have been developed to\\naddress these challenges, many struggle to balance accuracy and computational\\nefficiency, limiting their applicability to largescale datasets. In response,\\nwe introduce SpikeSift, a novel spike sorting algorithm designed to mitigate\\ndrift by partitioning recordings into short, relatively stationary segments,\\nwith spikes subsequently sorted within each. To preserve neuronal identity\\nacross segment boundaries, a computationally efficient alignment process merges\\nclusters without relying on continuous trajectory estimation. In contrast to\\nconventional methods that separate spike detection from clustering, SpikeSift\\nintegrates these processes within an iterative detect-andsubtract framework,\\nenhancing clustering accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.\\nEvaluations on intracellularly validated datasets and biophysically realistic\\nMEArec simulations confirm that SpikeSift maintains high sorting accuracy even\\nin the presence of electrode drift, providing a scalable and computationally\\nefficient solution for large-scale extracellular recordings\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP,q-bio.NC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:16:28Z\"}"}
