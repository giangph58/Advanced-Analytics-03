Since manual analysis and\\ndelineations of these images can be both labour-intensive and subject to\\nvariability, we develop an automatic pipeline to perform segmentation of the\\nleft atrial (LA) cavity, the right atrial (RA) cavity, and the wall of both\\natria on LGE-MRI. Our method is based on a two-stage nnU-Net architecture,\\ncombining 2D and 3D convolutional networks, and incorporates adaptive histogram\\nequalisation to improve tissue contrast in the input images and morphological\\noperations on the output segmentation maps. We achieve Dice similarity\\ncoefficients of 0.92 +/- 0.03, 0.93 +/- 0.03, 0.71 +/- 0.05 and 95% Hausdorff\\ndistances of (3.89 +/- 6.67) mm, (4.42 +/- 1.66) mm and (3.94 +/- 1.83) mm for\\nLA, RA, and wall, respectively. The accurate delineation of the LA, RA and the\\nmyocardial wall is the first step in analysing atrial structure in\\ncardiovascular patients, especially those with AF. This can allow clinicians to\\nprovide adequate and personalised treatment plans in a timely manner.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:08:33Z\"}"}
