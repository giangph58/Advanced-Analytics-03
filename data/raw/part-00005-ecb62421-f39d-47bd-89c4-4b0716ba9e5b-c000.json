{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15643v1\", \"title\": \"Multimodal Perception for Goal-oriented Navigation: A Survey\", \"summary\": \"Goal-oriented navigation presents a fundamental challenge for autonomous\\nsystems, requiring agents to navigate complex environments to reach designated\\ntargets. This survey offers a comprehensive analysis of multimodal navigation\\napproaches through the unifying perspective of inference domains, exploring how\\nagents perceive, reason about, and navigate environments using visual,\\nlinguistic, and acoustic information. Our key contributions include organizing\\nnavigation methods based on their primary environmental reasoning mechanisms\\nacross inference domains; systematically analyzing how shared computational\\nfoundations support seemingly disparate approaches across different navigation\\ntasks; identifying recurring patterns and distinctive strengths across various\\nnavigation paradigms; and examining the integration challenges and\\nopportunities of multimodal perception to enhance navigation capabilities. In\\naddition, we review approximately 200 relevant articles to provide an in-depth\\nunderstanding of the current landscape.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T07:01:00Z\"}"}
