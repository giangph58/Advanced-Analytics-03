However, LPs often face significant financial losses\\ndriven by poorly selected liquidity provision intervals and high costs\\nassociated with frequent liquidity reallocation. To support LPs in achieving\\nmore profitable liquidity concentration, we developed a tractable stochastic\\noptimization problem that can be used to compute optimal liquidity provision\\nintervals for profitable liquidity provision. The developed problem accounts\\nfor the relationships between liquidity rewards, divergence loss, and\\nreallocation costs. By formalizing optimal liquidity provision as a tractable\\nstochastic optimization problem, we support a better understanding of the\\nrelationship between liquidity rewards, divergence loss, and reallocation\\ncosts. Moreover, the stochastic optimization problem offers a foundation for\\nmore profitable liquidity concentration.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.TR\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.TR,q-fin.CP,q-fin.MF\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T09:13:53Z\"}"}
