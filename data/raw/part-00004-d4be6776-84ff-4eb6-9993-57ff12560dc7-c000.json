{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00549v1\", \"title\": \"Sum Rate Maximization for NOMA-Assisted Uplink Pinching-Antenna Systems\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we investigate an uplink communication scenario in which\\nmultiple users communicate with an access point (AP) employing non-orthogonal\\nmultiple access (NOMA). A pinching antenna, which can be activated at an\\narbitrary point along a dielectric waveguide, is deployed at the AP to\\ndynamically reconfigure user channels. The objective is to maximize the system\\nsum rate by jointly optimizing the pinching-antenna's position and the users'\\ntransmit powers. The formulated optimization problem is non-convex, and\\naddressed using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. For\\nperformance benchmarking, two time division multiple access (TDMA) schemes are\\nconsidered: one based on the pinching antenna individually activated for each\\nuser, and the other based on the single-pinching-antenna configuration serving\\nall users. Numerical results demonstrate that the use of the pinching antenna\\nsignificantly enhances the system sum rate compared to conventional antenna\\narchitectures. Moreover, the NOMA-based scheme outperforms the TDMA-based\\nscheme with a single pinching antenna but is outperformed by the TDMA-based\\napproach when the pinching antenna is adaptively configured for each user.\\nFinally, the proposed PSO-based method is shown to achieve near-optimal\\nperformance for both NOMA and TDMA with a common pinching-antenna\\nconfiguration.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,eess.SP,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T14:27:02Z\"}"}
