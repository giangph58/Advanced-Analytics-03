Our focus lies on the charges of energy and linear momentum, and we study\\ntheir behavior under the Einstein evolution equations. We construct foliations\\ndescribing the evolution of asymptotically hyperboloidal initial data sets\\nusing hyperboloidal time function. We define E-P chargeability as a property of\\nthe initial data set, and we show that it is preserved under the evolution for\\nour choice of time function. This ensures that the charges are well-defined\\nalong the evolution, which is crucial for our approach. Along such foliations,\\nwe recover the same energy-loss and linear momentum-loss formulae as those\\nderived by Bondi, Sachs, and Metzner \\\\cite{Bondi-vanderBurg-Metzner} while\\noperating under weaker asymptotic assumptions. Our approach is distinct from\\nprevious work as we do not utilize conformal compactifications and work\\ndirectly at the level of the initial data set.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T13:23:31Z\"}"}
