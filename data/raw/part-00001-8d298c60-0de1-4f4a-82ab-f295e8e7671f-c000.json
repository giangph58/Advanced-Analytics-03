We obtain a stability result for the sequence of martingale problems:\\nall narrow cluster points of the sequence of laws solve the formally limiting\\nmartingale problem. Through the solution of the limiting problem, we are able\\nto characterize the dynamics of limits of the empirical measure flows. A major\\nnew aspect of our result is that it requires rather weak regularity assumptions\\nfor the coefficients, for instance a form of local continuity of the drift in\\nthe measure argument and ellipticity of the diffusion coefficient for the\\nidiosyncratic noise. In fact, the formally limiting martingale problem may fail\\nto have any solution if there are discontinuities in the measure argument, so\\nthat the stability property is in general not true under low regularity\\nassumptions. Our novel approach leverages an emergence of regularity property\\nfor cluster points of the empirical measure flow. This provides us with a\\npriori analytic regularity estimates which we use to compensate for the low\\nregularity of the drift.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:29:15Z\"}"}
