This study explores how augmented reality\\n(AR) can provide an accessible training environment for public speaking.\\nDrawing from literature on public speaking, VR-based training, self-efficacy,\\nand behavioral feedback mechanisms, we designed SpeakAR, an AR-based tool that\\nsimulates audience interaction through virtual models. SpeakAR was evaluated\\nwith five participants of varying anxiety levels, each completing six speaking\\ntasks. Results indicate that AR exposure can enhance confidence, with\\nparticipants finding the system useful for practice. Feedback highlighted the\\nimportance of dynamic facial expressions and idle animations in virtual models\\nto improve realism and engagement. Our findings contribute to the design of\\nAR-based training tools for public speaking, offering insights into how\\nimmersive environments can support skill development and anxiety reduction.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:53:30Z\"}"}
