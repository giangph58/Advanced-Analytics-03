{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21593v1\", \"title\": \"Dark-technicolour at colliders\", \"summary\": \"By employing the extended most attractive channel hypothesis, we show that\\nQCD-like gauge dynamics is possible in the dark-technicolour paradigm. The\\ndark-technicolour paradigm can produce the mass of the Higgs boson, and at the\\nsame time, the $S$-parameter is also satisfied. Moreover, the dark-technicolour\\nparadigm can provide a solution of the flavour problem by accommodating the\\nstandard HVM or the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism within its framework. We present\\nthe inclusive collider signatures, such as $t\\\\bar{t}$ and $\\\\gamma \\\\gamma$, of\\nthe lowest lying scalars and pseudoscalars of the dark-technicolour paradigm,\\nfor the scenarios, when the standard HVM or the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism are\\nimplemented within its framework. The collider signatures are investigated at\\nthe high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider, the high-energy Large Hadron\\nCollider, and a 100 TeV future hadron collider. Several signatures are within\\nthe reach of the high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider. Additionally, one of\\nthe dark-Higgs of the model can address $95.4$ GeV excess reported by the ATLAS\\nand CMS experiments. Furthermore, one of the dark-Higgs can act like a new\\nclass of chirality-dependent dark-matter particles.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T12:51:17Z\"}"}
