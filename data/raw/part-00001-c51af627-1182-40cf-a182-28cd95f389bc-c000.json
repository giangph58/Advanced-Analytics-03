However, current methods\\nstill is confronted with two challenges: 1) these methods rarely explore the\\nlong-term feature dependencies in the frequency domain. 2) they can hardly\\npreserve the high-frequency details, and the changes in the marginal area of\\nthe sea ice cannot be accurately captured. To this end, we present a\\nFrequency-Compensated Network (FCNet) for Arctic SIC prediction on a daily\\nbasis. In particular, we design a dual-branch network, including branches for\\nfrequency feature extraction and convolutional feature extraction. For\\nfrequency feature extraction, we design an adaptive frequency filter block,\\nwhich integrates trainable layers with Fourier-based filters. By adding\\nfrequency features, the FCNet can achieve refined prediction of edges and\\ndetails. For convolutional feature extraction, we propose a high-frequency\\nenhancement block to separate high and low-frequency information. Moreover,\\nhigh-frequency features are enhanced via channel-wise attention, and temporal\\nattention unit is employed for low-frequency feature extraction to capture\\nlong-range sea ice changes. Extensive experiments are conducted on a\\nsatellite-derived daily SIC dataset, and the results verify the effectiveness\\nof the proposed FCNet.
