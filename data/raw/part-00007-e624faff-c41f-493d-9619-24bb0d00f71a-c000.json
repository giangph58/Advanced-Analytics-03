{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11305v1\", \"title\": \"CFIS-YOLO: A Lightweight Multi-Scale Fusion Network for Edge-Deployable\\n  Wood Defect Detection\", \"summary\": \"Wood defect detection is critical for ensuring quality control in the wood\\nprocessing industry. However, current industrial applications face two major\\nchallenges: traditional methods are costly, subjective, and labor-intensive,\\nwhile mainstream deep learning models often struggle to balance detection\\naccuracy and computational efficiency for edge deployment. To address these\\nissues, this study proposes CFIS-YOLO, a lightweight object detection model\\noptimized for edge devices. The model introduces an enhanced C2f structure, a\\ndynamic feature recombination module, and a novel loss function that\\nincorporates auxiliary bounding boxes and angular constraints. These\\ninnovations improve multi-scale feature fusion and small object localization\\nwhile significantly reducing computational overhead. Evaluated on a public wood\\ndefect dataset, CFIS-YOLO achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of\\n77.5\\\\%, outperforming the baseline YOLOv10s by 4 percentage points. On SOPHON\\nBM1684X edge devices, CFIS-YOLO delivers 135 FPS, reduces power consumption to\\n17.3\\\\% of the original implementation, and incurs only a 0.5 percentage point\\ndrop in mAP. These results demonstrate that CFIS-YOLO is a practical and\\neffective solution for real-world wood defect detection in resource-constrained\\nenvironments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:45:59Z\"}"}
