In\\nparticular, we use the method of comparison equations for $2\\\\times 2$ traceless\\nfirst-order systems to provide a unified perspective that yields similar proofs\\nin each setting. The use of a Weber model system gives results that are uniform\\nin the eigenvalue parameter over the whole range from the bottom of the\\npotential well up to finite values.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CA\", \"categories\": \"math.CA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:29:18Z\"}"}
