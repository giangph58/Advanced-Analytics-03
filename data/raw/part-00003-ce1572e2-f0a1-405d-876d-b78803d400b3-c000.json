It explores how Renn reinterprets Albert Einstein's contributions\\nto modern physics, especially special and general relativity, not primarily as\\nthe product of individual insight, but as emergent from broader epistemic\\nstructures and long-term knowledge systems. The discussion centers on key\\nconcepts such as \\\"challenging objects,\\\" \\\"epistemic matrices,\\\" \\\"mental models,\\\"\\nand \\\"borderline problems,\\\" and situates Renn's framework within broader debates\\ninvolving Thomas Kuhn, Ludwik Fleck, and Mara Beller. While recognizing the\\nhistoriographical strengths of Renn's structuralist approach, the article\\nraises questions about its implications for understanding individual agency,\\nconceptual creativity, and the philosophical dimensions of scientific change.\\nThe paper contends that a balanced account of scientific innovation must\\npreserve both the historical embeddedness of knowledge and the originality of\\nconceptual breakthroughs.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.hist-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.hist-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T11:46:25Z\"}"}
