In this\\nwork, we integrate the KPZ, Edwards-Wilkinson, and tensionless KPZ equations on\\nCayley trees using different numerical schemes and compare their behavior with\\nprevious results obtained for discrete growth models. By assessing the\\nstability and accuracy of these methods, we explore how network topology\\ninfluences interface growth and how boundary effects shape the observed scaling\\nproperties. Our results show good agreement with previous studies on discrete\\nmodels, reinforcing key scaling behaviors while highlighting some differences.\\nThese findings contribute to a better understanding of surface growth on\\nnetworked substrates and provide a computational framework for studying\\nnonlinear stochastic processes beyond Euclidean lattices.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:59:57Z\"}"}
