{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16847v1\", \"title\": \"Pulsed Magnetophononics in Gapped Quantum Magnets\", \"summary\": \"One route to the control of quantum magnetism at ultrafast timescales is\\nmagnetophononics, the modulation of magnetic interactions by coherently driven\\nlattice excitations. Theoretical studies of a gapped quantum magnet subject to\\ncontinuous, single-frequency driving of one strongly coupled phonon mode find\\nintriguing phenomena including mutually repelling phonon-bitriplon excitations\\nand global renormalization of the spin excitation spectrum. Because experiments\\nare performed with ultrashort pulses that contain a wide range of driving\\nfrequencies, we investigate phonon-bitriplon physics under pulsed laser\\ndriving. We use the equations of motion to compute the transient response of\\nthe driven and dissipative spin-phonon system, which we characterize using the\\nphonon displacement, phonon number, and triplon occupations. In the Fourier\\ntransforms of each quantity we discover a low-frequency energetic oscillation\\nbetween the lattice and spin sectors, which is an intrinsically nonequilibrium\\ncollective mode, and demonstrate its origin as a beating between mutually\\nrepelling composite excitations. We introduce a phonon-bitriplon approximation\\nthat captures all the physics of hybridization, collective mode formation, and\\ndifference-frequency excitation, and show that sum-frequency phenomena also\\nleave clear signatures in the repsonse. We model the appearance of such\\nmagnetophononic phenomena in the strongly-coupled spin-chain compound\\nCuGeO$_3$, whose overlapping phonon and spin excitation spectra are well\\ncharacterized, to deduce the criteria for their possible observation in quantum\\nmagnetic materials.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T16:10:01Z\"}"}
