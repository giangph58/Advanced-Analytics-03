{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19636v1\", \"title\": \"Fitness Landscape of Large Language Model-Assisted Automated Algorithm\\n  Search\", \"summary\": \"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in\\nalgorithm design. However, when integrated into search frameworks for iterative\\nalgorithm search, the underlying fitness landscape--critical for understanding\\nsearch behaviou--remains underexplored. In this paper, we illustrate and\\nanalyze the fitness landscape of LLM-assisted Algorithm Search (LAS) using a\\ngraph-based approach, where nodes represent algorithms and edges denote\\ntransitions between them. We conduct extensive evaluations across six algorithm\\ndesign tasks and six commonly used LLMs. Our findings reveal that LAS\\nlandscapes are highly multimodal and rugged, particularly in combinatorial\\noptimization tasks, with distinct structural variations across tasks and LLMs.\\nFor instance, heuristic design tasks exhibit dense clusters of high-performing\\nalgorithms, while symbolic regression tasks show sparse, scattered\\ndistributions. Additionally, we demonstrate how population size influences\\nexploration-exploitation trade-offs and the evolving trajectory of elite\\nalgorithms. These insights not only advance our understanding of LAS landscapes\\nbut also provide practical guidance for designing more effective LAS methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.NE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T09:52:41Z\"}"}
