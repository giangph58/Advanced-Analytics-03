{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05363v1\", \"title\": \"Starobinsky like inflation and EGB Gravity in the light of ACT\", \"summary\": \"The ACT data shows an enhancement in the value of the scalar spectral index,\\nas $n_s = 0.9743 \\\\pm 0.0034$, leading to disfavoring many inflationary models,\\nincluding the Starobinsky model. To satisfy the constraint made by ACT, we will\\ninvestigate the Starobinsky potential within the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet(EGB)\\ngravity theory. EGB gravity is motivated by the higher-dimensional theory,\\nwhich includes quadratic curvature correction terms and a coupling between the\\nscalar field and the GB term that modifies the dynamical equations. The model\\nis considered by using the slow-roll approximation method and the exact\\nnumerical approach for two different coupling functions. The results indicate\\nthat the model is in good agreement with the data and the results stand in\\n$1\\\\sigma$ of the ACT $r-n_s$ plane. Considering the running of the scalar\\nspectral index also implies the consistency of the model with data. In\\naddition, the parametric space of the free parameters of the EGB coupling is\\nexplored, where we find the acceptable region of the parameters in which the\\nresulting $n_s$ and $r$ stay in $1\\\\sigma$ of the ACT data. Next, the reheating\\nphase is considered. It is determined that the model can simultaneously satisfy\\nthe constraint of ACT data and the reheating temperature constraints.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:56:49Z\"}"}
