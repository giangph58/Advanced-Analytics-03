{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04777v1\", \"title\": \"Dispersion in Rotating Electron-Positron-Ion Quantum Plasma\", \"summary\": \"Quantum plasmas in astrophysical environments are abundant due to extreme\\nelectric, magnetic, and gravitational fields. These plasmas can be most clearly\\nobserved in neutron stars, white dwarfs, brown dwarfs, red dwarfs, accretion\\ndisks of black holes, pulsars, quasars, and more. This paper examines the\\npropagation of electromagnetic waves in a three-component e-p-i quantum plasma\\nwithin a rotating frame, considering the particles' spin, Fermi pressure, and\\nquantum Bohm potential. Additionally, effects unique to this specific\\nenvironment, such as rotation and gravity, are included. The dispersion of\\nelectrons, ions, and positrons has been obtained separately, and their coupling\\nhas been analyzed to understand the collective behavior. It has been noted that\\nthe quantum effects of Fermi pressure and Bohm potential significantly\\ninfluence particle dynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T07:09:37Z\"}"}
