There generically exists an epoch at which the\\nlinear bias of the 21cm field crosses zero, independent of the precise\\nastrophysics of reionization. This epoch implies the 21cm radiation is a\\nnatural \\\"zero-bias tracer\\\" in the sense of Castorina et al (2018). We identify\\nnew noise-like contributions which directly compete with the zero-bias effect,\\nbut which should be mitigated through sophisticated analysis techniques such as\\nfield-level reconstruction. These noise-like terms act to hinder the\\nconstraining power on local PNG of the brightness temperature fluctuations,\\nmaking $\\\\sigma (f_{\\\\rm NL}^{\\\\rm loc}) \\\\leq 1$ unachievable even in simplified\\nforecasts. We show that analyses which can reach the 'sampling noise' floor for\\nthis tracer and harness its full power can potentially unlock a 10-fold\\nreduction in error bars, even in the presence of large-scale cuts from\\nforegrounds. The potential of this epoch motivates searching for it in future\\n21cm surveys, along with developing analysis techniques that can reach the\\nnoise floor required for the zero-bias epoch to saturate Fisher information.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:48:49Z\"}"}
