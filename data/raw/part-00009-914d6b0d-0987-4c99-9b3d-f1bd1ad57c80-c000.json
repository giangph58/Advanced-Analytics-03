{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15622v1\", \"title\": \"Exploring the Role of Large Language Models in Cybersecurity: A\\n  Systematic Survey\", \"summary\": \"With the rapid development of technology and the acceleration of\\ndigitalisation, the frequency and complexity of cyber security threats are\\nincreasing. Traditional cybersecurity approaches, often based on static rules\\nand predefined scenarios, are struggling to adapt to the rapidly evolving\\nnature of modern cyberattacks. There is an urgent need for more adaptive and\\nintelligent defence strategies. The emergence of Large Language Model (LLM)\\nprovides an innovative solution to cope with the increasingly severe cyber\\nthreats, and its potential in analysing complex attack patterns, predicting\\nthreats and assisting real-time response has attracted a lot of attention in\\nthe field of cybersecurity, and exploring how to effectively use LLM to defend\\nagainst cyberattacks has become a hot topic in the current research field. This\\nsurvey examines the applications of LLM from the perspective of the cyber\\nattack lifecycle, focusing on the three phases of defense reconnaissance,\\nfoothold establishment, and lateral movement, and it analyzes the potential of\\nLLMs in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) tasks. Meanwhile, we investigate how\\nLLM-based security solutions are deployed and applied in different network\\nscenarios. It also summarizes the internal and external risk issues faced by\\nLLM during its application. Finally, this survey also points out the facing\\nrisk issues and possible future research directions in this domain.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T06:28:08Z\"}"}
