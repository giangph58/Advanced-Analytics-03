A computational scheme has been developed that can enable\\nthe elimination of gas leakage through the modeling and management of parallel\\ngas pipeline systems. The dynamic state of processes for the supply of modern\\nautomatic equipment to gas pipelines and the use of an efficient automated\\ncontrol system have been extensively studied. The analytical determination of\\nthe optimal transition time has been widely applied to ensure the most\\nfavorable operating conditions for the system. Methods for calculating complex\\ntransient processes in main gas pipelines, from a non-stationary regime to a\\nstationary regime, have been developed, particularly at the moment of gas flow\\ningress. A comparison of mathematical expressions for calculating transient\\nprocesses in complex main gas pipelines has been conducted through theoretical\\nsources.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T15:46:19Z\"}"}
