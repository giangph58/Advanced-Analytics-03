{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13009v1\", \"title\": \"Sequential ejections of plasma blobs due to unbraiding of tangled loops\\n  in the solar atmosphere\", \"summary\": \"Nanoflares, which are consequences of braids in tangled magnetic fields, are\\nan important candidate to heat the solar corona to million degrees. However,\\ntheir observational evidence is sparse and many of their observational\\ncharacteristics are yet to be discovered. With the high-resolution observations\\ntaken by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager onboard the Solar Orbiter, here we\\nstudy a series of ejections of plasma blobs resulted from a braided magnetic\\nloops in the upper transition region and reveal some critical characteristics\\nof such processes. The cores of these ejections have a size of about 700\\\\,km, a\\nduration less than 1 minute and a speed of about 90\\\\,\\\\kms. An important\\ncharacteristic is that these plasma blobs are apparently constrained by the\\npost-reconnection magnetic loops, along which they show an extension of up to\\nabout 2\\\\,000\\\\,km. The propagation of unbraiding nodes along the main axis of\\nthe tangled loops has a speed of about 45\\\\,\\\\kms. The separation angles between\\nthe post-reconnection loops and the main axis of the tangled loops are about\\n30\\\\degree. The observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly reveal that\\nthe braiding loops are upper transition region structures. Based on these\\nobservations, the typical magnetic free energy producing a blob is estimated to\\nbe about $3.4\\\\times10^{23}$\\\\,erg, well in the nano-flare regime, while the\\nkinematic energy of a blob is about $2.3\\\\times10^{23}$\\\\,erg, suggesting that a\\nmajority of magnetic free energy in a magnetic braid is likely transferred into\\nkinematic energy.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T15:16:17Z\"}"}
