{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06649v1\", \"title\": \"GRAIN: Multi-Granular and Implicit Information Aggregation Graph Neural\\n  Network for Heterophilous Graphs\", \"summary\": \"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown significant success in learning graph\\nrepresentations. However, recent studies reveal that GNNs often fail to\\noutperform simple MLPs on heterophilous graph tasks, where connected nodes may\\ndiffer in features or labels, challenging the homophily assumption. Existing\\nmethods addressing this issue often overlook the importance of information\\ngranularity and rarely consider implicit relationships between distant nodes.\\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose the Granular and Implicit Graph\\nNetwork (GRAIN), a novel GNN model specifically designed for heterophilous\\ngraphs. GRAIN enhances node embeddings by aggregating multi-view information at\\nvarious granularity levels and incorporating implicit data from distant,\\nnon-neighboring nodes. This approach effectively integrates local and global\\ninformation, resulting in smoother, more accurate node representations. We also\\nintroduce an adaptive graph information aggregator that efficiently combines\\nmulti-granularity and implicit data, significantly improving node\\nrepresentation quality, as shown by experiments on 13 datasets covering varying\\nhomophily and heterophily. GRAIN consistently outperforms 12 state-of-the-art\\nmodels, excelling on both homophilous and heterophilous graphs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T07:36:44Z\"}"}
