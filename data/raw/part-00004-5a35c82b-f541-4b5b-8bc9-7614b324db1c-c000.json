AMT is\\na challenging problem, particularly when it comes to polyphonic music. The goal\\nof AMT is to produce a score representation of a music piece, by analyzing a\\nsound signal containing multiple notes played simultaneously. In this work, we\\ndesign a processing pipeline that can transform classical piano audio files in\\n.wav format into a music score representation. The features from the audio\\nsignals are extracted using the constant-Q transform, and the resulting\\ncoefficients are used as an input to the convolutional neural network (CNN)\\nmodel.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SD\", \"categories\": \"cs.SD,cs.AI,cs.LG,cs.MM,eess.AS\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:20:43Z\"}"}
