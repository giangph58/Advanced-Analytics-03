{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04402v1\", \"title\": \"Non-Stationary Discs and Instabilities\", \"summary\": \"We review our current knowledge of thermal and viscous instabilities in\\naccretion discs around compact objects. We begin with classical disc models\\nbased on analytic viscosity prescriptions, discussing physical uncertainties\\nand exploring time-dependent solutions of disc evolution. We also review the\\nionization instability responsible for outbursting dwarf nova and X-ray binary\\nsystems, including some detailed comparisons between alpha-based models and the\\nobserved characteristics of these systems. We then review modern theoretical\\nwork based on ideas around angular momentum transport mediated by magnetic\\nfields, focusing in particular on knowledge gained through local and global\\ncomputer simulations of MHD processes in discs. We discuss how MHD may alter\\nour understanding of outbursts in white dwarf and X-ray binary systems.\\nFinally, we turn to the putative thermal/viscous instabilities that were\\npredicted to exist in the inner, radiation pressure-dominated regions of black\\nhole and neutron star discs, in apparent contradiction to the observed\\nstability of the high/soft state in black hole X-ray binaries.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T13:36:36Z\"}"}
