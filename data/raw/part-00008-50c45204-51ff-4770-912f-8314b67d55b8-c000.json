{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21592v1\", \"title\": \"A Protection-Interoperable Fault Ride-Through Control for Grid-Forming\\n  Inverters\", \"summary\": \"Differing from synchronous generators (SGs), grid-forming inverter-based\\nresources (GFM-IBRs) exhibit rapid variations in their output impedances during\\ntransmission line faults due to the overcurrent limitation. As a result, the\\nsource dynamics during the fault period deviate significantly from those under\\npre-fault conditions. This fundamental difference alters the fault responses of\\nincremental quantities, thereby jeopardizing the reliability of the supervising\\nelements in protective relays that are based on these quantities. To address\\nthis challenge, a protection-interoperable fault ride-through (FRT) method for\\nGFM-IBRs is proposed. This method dynamically adjusts power control of GFM-IBRs\\nin response to the changes in output impedance, effectively mitigating\\nvariations in source dynamics and thereby preserving the reliability of\\nincremental quantity-based supervising elements. This method also ensures\\neffective overcurrent limitation and transient stability of GFM-IBRs.\\nController hardware-in-the-loop (CHIL) and experimental tests validate the\\neffectiveness of the proposed method.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T12:50:15Z\"}"}
