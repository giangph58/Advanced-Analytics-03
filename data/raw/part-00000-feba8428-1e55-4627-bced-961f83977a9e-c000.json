{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17255v1\", \"title\": \"3D Deep-learning-based Segmentation of Human Skin Sweat Glands and Their\\n  3D Morphological Response to Temperature Variations\", \"summary\": \"Skin, the primary regulator of heat exchange, relies on sweat glands for\\nthermoregulation. Alterations in sweat gland morphology play a crucial role in\\nvarious pathological conditions and clinical diagnoses. Current methods for\\nobserving sweat gland morphology are limited by their two-dimensional, in\\nvitro, and destructive nature, underscoring the urgent need for real-time,\\nnon-invasive, quantifiable technologies. We proposed a novel three-dimensional\\n(3D) transformer-based multi-object segmentation framework, integrating a\\nsliding window approach, joint spatial-channel attention mechanism, and\\narchitectural heterogeneity between shallow and deep layers. Our proposed\\nnetwork enables precise 3D sweat gland segmentation from skin volume data\\ncaptured by optical coherence tomography (OCT). For the first time, subtle\\nvariations of sweat gland 3D morphology in response to temperature changes,\\nhave been visualized and quantified. Our approach establishes a benchmark for\\nnormal sweat gland morphology and provides a real-time, non-invasive tool for\\nquantifying 3D structural parameters. This enables the study of individual\\nvariability and pathological changes in sweat gland structure, advancing\\ndermatological research and clinical applications, including thermoregulation\\nand bromhidrosis treatment.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.AI,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T05:19:47Z\"}"}
