While topological magnons can be identified\\nthrough the detection of chiral propagating modes at the sample's edge, an\\nintriguing approach would be to directly probe their topological nature via\\nlocalized measurements deep within the bulk. In this work, we introduce a\\nquantized topological marker suitable for topological spin systems, which can\\nbe experimentally accessed by combining a local driven-dissipative preparation\\nscheme with a circular-dichroic measurement. Demonstrated on a 2D ferromagnetic\\nHeisenberg spin system incorporating Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, this\\nmethod effectively maps a local Chern marker with single-site resolution while\\ninherently accounting for magnon losses. Our work offers a general strategy to\\naccess local topological markers in bosonic settings within a\\ndriven-dissipative framework.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.other,cond-mat.quant-gas,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T08:47:48Z\"}"}
