{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15878v1\", \"title\": \"Defects, Sound Damping, and the Boson Peak in Amorphous Solids\", \"summary\": \"Two nearly universal and anomalous properties of glasses, the peak in the\\nspecific heat and plateau of the thermal conductivity, occur around the same\\ntemperature. This coincidence suggests that the two phenomena are related. Both\\neffects can be rationalized by assuming Rayleigh scaling of sound attenuation\\nand this scaling leads one to consider scattering from defects. Identifying\\ndefects in glasses, which are inherently disordered, is a long-standing problem\\nthat was approached in several ways. We examine candidates for defects in\\nglasses that represent areas of strong sound damping. We show that some defects\\nare associated with quasi-localized excitations, which may be associated with\\nmodes in excess of the Debye theory. We also examine generalized Debye\\nrelations, which relate sound damping and the speed of sound to excess modes.\\nWe derive a generalized Debye relation that does not resort to an approximation\\nused by previous authors. We find that our relation and the relation given by\\nprevious authors are almost identical at small frequencies and also reproduce\\nthe independently determined density of states. However, the different\\ngeneralized Debye relations do not agree around the boson peak. While\\ngeneralized Debye relations accurately predict the boson peak in\\ntwo-dimensional glasses, they under estimate the boson peak in\\nthree-dimensional glasses.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn,cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T13:24:51Z\"}"}
