Champanerkar and Kofman defined a\\ncomplex generated by the spanning trees of a graph obtained from the\\ncheckerboard coloring whose homology is the reduced Khovanov homology. Notably,\\nthe differential in their chain complex was not explicitly defined. We\\nexplicitly define the combinatorial form of the differential within the\\nspanning tree complex. We additionally provide a description of Rasmussen's\\n$s$-invariant within the context of the spanning tree complex. Applying our\\ntechniques, we identify a new infinite family of knots where each of them\\nbounds a set of exotic discs within the 4-ball.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GT\", \"categories\": \"math.GT,math.CO,math.QA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:23:50Z\"}"}
