{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12239v1\", \"title\": \"The Discovery of Two Quadruple Star Systems with the Second and Third\\n  Shortest Outer Periods\", \"summary\": \"We present the discovery of two quadruple star systems -- TIC 285853156 and\\nTIC 392229331 -- each consisting of two bound eclipsing binary stars. Among the\\nmost compact quadruples known, TIC 392229331 and TIC 285853156 have the second\\nand third shortest outer orbital periods (145 days and 152 days, respectively)\\nafter BU Canis Minoris (122 days, Pribulla et al. 2023). We demonstrate that\\nboth systems are long-term dynamically stable despite substantial outer orbital\\neccentricities (0.33 for TIC 285853156 and 0.56 for TIC 392229331). We\\npreviously reported these systems in Kostov et al. (2022) and Kostov et al.\\n(2024) as 2+2 hierarchical quadruple candidates producing two sets of primary\\nand secondary eclipses in TESS data, as well as prominent eclipse timing\\nvariations on both binary components. We combine all available TESS data and\\nnew spectroscopic observations into a comprehensive photodynamical model,\\nproving that the component binary stars are gravitationally bound in both\\nsystems and finding accurate stellar and orbital parameters for both systems,\\nincluding very precise determinations of the outer periods. TIC 285853156 and\\nTIC 392229331 represent the latest addition to the small population of\\nwell-characterized proven quadruple systems dynamically interacting on\\ndetectable timescales.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T16:44:33Z\"}"}
