We remove discrete\\nspectrum of initial RHP using Darboux transformations.\\n  By applying the nonlinear steepest-descent method for RHP introduced by Deift\\nand Zhou,\\n  we compute the long-time asymptotic\\n  expansion of the solution $\\\\mathbf{q}(x,t)$ to an (optimal) residual error of\\norder $\\\\mathcal{O}\\\\left(t^{-3 / 4+1/(2p)}\\\\right)$ where\\n  $2\\\\le p<\\\\infty$. The leading order term in this expansion is a multi-soliton\\nwhose parameters are modulated by soliton-soliton and\\n  soliton-radiation interactions. Our work strengthens and extends the earlier\\nwork regarding long-time\\n  asymptotics for solutions of the nonlinear Schr\\\\\\\"odinger equation with a\\ndelta potential and even initial data by Deift and Park.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.SI\", \"categories\": \"nlin.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T05:03:18Z\"}"}
