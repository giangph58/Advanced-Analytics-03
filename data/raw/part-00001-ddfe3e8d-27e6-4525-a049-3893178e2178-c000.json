The start point is to set up the representations of\\n$z^\\\\alpha$ and $z^\\\\alpha\\\\log z$ in the slit disk and develop results akin to\\nPaley-Wiener theorem, from which, together with the Poisson summation formula,\\nthe root-exponential convergence of the lightning plus polynomial scheme with\\nan exact order for each clustered parameter is established in approximation of\\nprototype functions $g(z)z^\\\\alpha$ or $g(z)z^\\\\alpha\\\\log z$ on a sector-shaped\\ndomain, which includes $[0,1]$ as a special case. In addition, the fastest\\nconvergence rate is confirmed based upon the best choice of the clustered\\nparameter. Furthermore, the optimal choice of the clustered parameter and the\\nconvergence rate for corner singularity problems in solving Laplace equations\\nare attested based on Lehman and Wasow's study of corner singularities and\\nalong with the decomposition of Gopal and Trefethen. The thorough analysis\\nprovides a solid foundation for lightning schemes and rational approximation.\\nAmple numerical evidences demonstrate the optimality and sharpness of the\\nestimates.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T14:28:18Z\"}"}
