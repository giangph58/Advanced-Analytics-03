{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17477v1\", \"title\": \"Mean convergence rates for Gaussian-smoothed Wasserstein distances and\\n  classical Wasserstein distances\", \"summary\": \"We establish upper bounds for the expected Gaussian-smoothed $p$-Wasserstein\\ndistance between a probability measure $\\\\mu$ and the corresponding empirical\\nmeasure $\\\\mu_N$, whenever $\\\\mu$ has finite $q$-th moments for any $q>p$. This\\ngeneralizes recent results that were valid only for $q>2p+2d$. We provide two\\ndistinct proofs of such a result. We also use a third upper bound for the\\nGaussian-smoothed $p$-Wasserstein distance to derive an upper bound for the\\nclassical $p$-Wasserstein distance. Although the latter upper bound is not\\noptimal when $\\\\mu$ has finite $q$-th moment with $q>p$, this bound does not\\nrequire imposing such a moment condition on $\\\\mu$, as it is usually done in the\\nliterature.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T12:08:27Z\"}"}
