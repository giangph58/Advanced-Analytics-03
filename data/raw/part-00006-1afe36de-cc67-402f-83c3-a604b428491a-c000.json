{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14995v1\", \"title\": \"Trainable Quantum Neural Network for Multiclass Image Classification\\n  with the Power of Pre-trained Tree Tensor Networks\", \"summary\": \"Tree tensor networks (TTNs) offer powerful models for image classification.\\nWhile these TTN image classifiers already show excellent performance on\\nclassical hardware, embedding them into quantum neural networks (QNNs) may\\nfurther improve the performance by leveraging quantum resources. However,\\nembedding TTN classifiers into QNNs for multiclass classification remains\\nchallenging. Key obstacles are the highorder gate operations required for large\\nbond dimensions and the mid-circuit postselection with exponentially low\\nsuccess rates necessary for the exact embedding. In this work, to address these\\nchallenges, we propose forest tensor network (FTN)-classifiers, which aggregate\\nmultiple small-bond-dimension TTNs. This allows us to handle multiclass\\nclassification without requiring large gates in the embedded circuits. We then\\nremove the overhead of mid-circuit postselection by extending the adiabatic\\nencoding framework to our setting and smoothly encode the FTN-classifiers into\\na quantum forest tensor network (qFTN)- classifiers. Numerical experiments on\\nMNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that we can successfully train FTN-classifiers\\nand encode them into qFTN-classifiers, while maintaining or even improving the\\nperformance of the pre-trained FTN-classifiers. These results suggest that\\nsynergy between TTN classification models and QNNs can provide a robust and\\nscalable framework for multiclass quantum-enhanced image classification.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T09:51:39Z\"}"}
