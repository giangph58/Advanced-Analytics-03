Although there are several approaches for point-estimation of mode\\nin the literature, very little has been explored about the interval-estimation\\nof mode. Our work proposes a collection of novel methods of obtaining finite\\nsample valid confidence set of the mode of a unimodal distribution. We analyze\\nthe behaviour of the width of the proposed confidence sets under some\\nregularity assumptions of the density about the mode and show that the width of\\nthese confidence sets shrink to zero near optimally. Simply put, we show that\\nit is possible to build finite sample valid confidence sets for the mode that\\nshrink to a singleton as sample size increases. We support the theoretical\\nresults by showing the performance of the proposed methods on some synthetic\\ndata-sets. We believe that our confidence sets can be improved both in\\nconstruction and in terms of rate.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.ME,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T04:25:38Z\"}"}
