{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21715v1\", \"title\": \"Entanglement-Enhanced Nanoscale Single-Spin Sensing\", \"summary\": \"Detecting individual spins--including stable and metastable\\nstates--represents a fundamental challenge in quantum sensing with broad\\napplications across condensed matter physics, quantum chemistry, and\\nsingle-molecule magnetic resonance imaging. While nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers\\nin diamond have emerged as powerful nanoscale sensors, their performance for\\nsingle-spin detection remains constrained by substantial environmental noise\\nand restricted sensing volume. Here, we propose and demonstrate an\\nentanglement-enhanced sensing protocol that overcomes these limitations through\\nthe strategic use of entangled NV pairs. Our approach achieves a 3.4-fold\\nenhancement in sensitivity and a 1.6-fold reduction in spatial resolution\\nrelative to single NV centers under ambient conditions. The protocol employs\\ncarefully engineered entangled states that amplify target spin signals through\\nquantum interference while suppressing environmental noise. Crucially, we\\nextend these capabilities to resolve metastable single-spin dynamics, directly\\nobserving stochastic transitions between different spin states by identifying\\nstate-dependent coupling strengths. This dual functionality enables\\nsimultaneous detection of static and dynamic spin species for studying complex\\nquantum systems. The achieved performance establishes entanglement-enhanced\\nsensing as a viable pathway toward atomic-scale characterization of quantum\\nmaterials and interface.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:59:58Z\"}"}
