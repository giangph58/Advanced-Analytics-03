The\\nmain challenge arises from the nonlinear, nonlocal nature of the consensus\\npoint, coupled with a diffusion term that is both singular and degenerate. By\\nemploying a regularization procedure in combination with a compactness\\nargument, we establish the global existence and uniqueness of weak solutions in\\n$L^\\\\infty(0,T;L^1\\\\cap L^\\\\infty(\\\\mathbb{R}^d))$. Furthermore, we show that the\\nweak solutions exhibit improved $H^2$-regularity when the initial data is\\nregular.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T09:02:36Z\"}"}
