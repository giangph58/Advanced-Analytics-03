{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21287v1\", \"title\": \"The new compact triple system: discovery of bright third star around\\n  contact binary using LAMOST-MRS spectra and photometry\", \"summary\": \"We present a study of the third star orbiting around known contact eclipsing\\nbinary J04+25 using spectra from the LAMOST medium-resolution survey (MRS) and\\npublicly available photometry. This is a rare case of a hierarchical triple,\\nwhere the third star is significantly brighter than the inner contact\\nsubsystem. We successfully extracted radial velocities for all three\\ncomponents, using the binary spectral model in two steps. Third star radial\\nvelocities have high precision and allow direct fitting of the orbit. The low\\nprecision of radial velocity measurements in the contact system is compensated\\nby large number statistics. We employed a template matching technique for light\\ncurves to find periodic variation due to the light time travel effect (LTTE)\\nusing several photometric datasets. Joint fit of third star radial velocities\\nand LTTE allowed us to get a consistent orbital solution with\\n$P_3=941.40\\\\pm0.03$ day and $e_3=0.059\\\\pm0.007$. We made estimations of the\\nmasses $M_{\\\\rm 12,~3}\\\\sin^3{i_3}=1.05\\\\pm0.02,~0.90\\\\pm0.02~M_\\\\odot$ in a wide\\nsystem and discussed possible determination of an astrometric orbit in the\\nfuture data release of Gaia. Additionally, we propose an empirical method for\\nmeasuring a period and minimal mass of contact systems, based on variation of\\nthe projected rotational velocity ($V\\\\sin{i}$) from the spectra.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T03:40:41Z\"}"}
