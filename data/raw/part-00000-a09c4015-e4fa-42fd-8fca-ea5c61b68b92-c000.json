{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03178v1\", \"title\": \"RADE: Learning Risk-Adjustable Driving Environment via Multi-Agent\\n  Conditional Diffusion\", \"summary\": \"Generating safety-critical scenarios in high-fidelity simulations offers a\\npromising and cost-effective approach for efficient testing of autonomous\\nvehicles. Existing methods typically rely on manipulating a single vehicle's\\ntrajectory through sophisticated designed objectives to induce adversarial\\ninteractions, often at the cost of realism and scalability. In this work, we\\npropose the Risk-Adjustable Driving Environment (RADE), a simulation framework\\nthat generates statistically realistic and risk-adjustable traffic scenes.\\nBuilt upon a multi-agent diffusion architecture, RADE jointly models the\\nbehavior of all agents in the environment and conditions their trajectories on\\na surrogate risk measure. Unlike traditional adversarial methods, RADE learns\\nrisk-conditioned behaviors directly from data, preserving naturalistic\\nmulti-agent interactions with controllable risk levels. To ensure physical\\nplausibility, we incorporate a tokenized dynamics check module that efficiently\\nfilters generated trajectories using a motion vocabulary. We validate RADE on\\nthe real-world rounD dataset, demonstrating that it preserves statistical\\nrealism across varying risk levels and naturally increases the likelihood of\\nsafety-critical events as the desired risk level grows up. Our results\\nhighlight RADE's potential as a scalable and realistic tool for AV safety\\nevaluation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T04:41:20Z\"}"}
