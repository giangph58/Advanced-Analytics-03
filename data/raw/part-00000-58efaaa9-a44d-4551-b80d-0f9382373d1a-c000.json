The\\nframework incorporates a wide range of unobserved heterogeneity. I show that\\nsuch models are nonparametrically identified. Based on constructive\\nidentification arguments, I build a novel two-step estimation method in the\\nlineage of Hotz and Miller (1993) and Arcidiacono and Miller (2011) but\\nextended to simultaneous discrete-continuous choice. In the first step, I\\nrecover the (type-dependent) optimal choices with an expectation-maximization\\nalgorithm and instrumental variable quantile regression. In the second step, I\\nestimate the primitives of the model taking the estimated optimal choices as\\ngiven. The method is especially attractive for complex dynamic models because\\nit significantly reduces the computational burden associated with their\\nestimation compared to alternative full solution methods.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.EM\", \"categories\": \"econ.EM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T11:40:49Z\"}"}
