{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11798v1\", \"title\": \"Neighbor-Based Feature and Index Enhancement for Person\\n  Re-Identification\", \"summary\": \"Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match the same pedestrian in a large\\ngallery with different cameras and views. Enhancing the robustness of the\\nextracted feature representations is a main challenge in Re-ID. Existing\\nmethods usually improve feature representation by improving model architecture,\\nbut most methods ignore the potential contextual information, which limits the\\neffectiveness of feature representation and retrieval performance. Neighborhood\\ninformation, especially the potential information of multi-order neighborhoods,\\ncan effectively enrich feature expression and improve retrieval accuracy, but\\nthis has not been fully explored in existing research. Therefore, we propose a\\nnovel model DMON-ARO that leverages latent neighborhood information to enhance\\nboth feature representation and index performance. Our approach is built on two\\ncomplementary modules: Dynamic Multi-Order Neighbor Modeling (DMON) and\\nAsymmetric Relationship Optimization (ARO). The DMON module dynamically\\naggregates multi-order neighbor relationships, allowing it to capture richer\\ncontextual information and enhance feature representation through adaptive\\nneighborhood modeling. Meanwhile, ARO refines the distance matrix by optimizing\\nquery-to-gallery relationships, improving the index accuracy. Extensive\\nexperiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves\\nperformance improvements against baseline models, which illustrate the\\neffectiveness of our model. Specifically, our model demonstrates improvements\\nin Rank-1 accuracy and mAP. Moreover, this method can also be directly extended\\nto other re-identification tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T06:13:20Z\"}"}
