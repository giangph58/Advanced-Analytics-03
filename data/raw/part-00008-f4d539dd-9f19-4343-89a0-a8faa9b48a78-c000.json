{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02447v1\", \"title\": \"Measuring the Low-Energy Weak Mixing Angle with Supernova Neutrinos\", \"summary\": \"The weak mixing angle $\\\\theta_W$ is a fundamental parameter in the\\nelectroweak theory with a value running according to the energy scale, and its\\nprecision measurement in the low-energy regime is still ongoing. We propose a\\nmethod to measure the low-energy $\\\\sin{^2\\\\theta_W}$ by taking advantage of\\nArgo, a future ton-scale liquid argon dark matter detector, and the neutrino\\nflux from a nearby core-collapse supernova (CCSN). We evaluate the expected\\nprecision of this measurement through the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus\\nscattering (CE$\\\\nu$NS) channel. We show that Argo is potentially capable of\\nachieving a few percent determination of $\\\\sin{^2\\\\theta_W}$, at the momentum\\ntransfer of $q \\\\sim 20$ MeV, in the observation of a CCSN within $\\\\sim 3$ kpc\\nfrom the Earth. Such a measurement is valuable for both the precision test of\\nthe electroweak theory and searching for new physics beyond the standard model\\nin the neutrino sector.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T10:06:06Z\"}"}
