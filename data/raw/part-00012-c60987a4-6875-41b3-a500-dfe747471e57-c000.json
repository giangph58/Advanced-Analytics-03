While StreamPETR\\nexhibits strong 3D bounding box detection performance as reflected by its high\\nmean Average Precision our analysis identified velocity estimation as a\\nsubstantial bottleneck when evaluated on the NuScenes dataset. To overcome this\\nlimitation, we propose a customized positional embedding strategy tailored to\\nenhance temporal modeling capabilities. Experimental evaluations conducted on\\nthe NuScenes test set demonstrate that our improved approach achieves a\\nstate-of-the-art NDS of 70.86% using the ViT-L backbone, setting a new\\nbenchmark for camera-only 3D object detection.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T05:05:31Z\"}"}
