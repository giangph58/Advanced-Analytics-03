To address this issue,\\nvarious parity logging methods have been pro- posed. Nevertheless, due to the\\nlong update path and substantial amount of random I/O involved in erasure code\\nupdate processes, the resulting long latency and low throughput often fail to\\nmeet the requirements of high performance applications. To this end, we propose\\na two-stage data update method called TSUE. TSUE divides the update process\\ninto a synchronous stage that records updates in a data log, and an\\nasynchronous stage that recycles the log in real-time. TSUE effectively reduces\\nupdate latency by transforming random I/O into sequential I/O, and it\\nsignificantly reduces recycle overhead by utilizing a three-layer log and the\\nspatio-temporal locality of access patterns. In SSDs cluster, TSUE\\nsignificantly im- proves update performance, achieving improvements of 7.6X\\nunder Ali-Cloud trace, 5X under Ten-Cloud trace, while it also extends the\\nSSD's lifespan by up to 13X through reducing the frequencies of reads/writes\\nand of erase operations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:24:16Z\"}"}
