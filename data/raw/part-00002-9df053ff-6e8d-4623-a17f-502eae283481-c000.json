To equip\\nresource-constrained aerial systems with this safety-critical capability, we\\npresent ViSafe, a high-speed vision-only airborne collision avoidance system.\\nViSafe offers a full-stack solution to the Detect and Avoid (DAA) problem by\\ntightly integrating a learning-based edge-AI framework with a custom\\nmulti-camera hardware prototype designed under SWaP-C constraints. By\\nleveraging perceptual input-focused control barrier functions (CBF) to design,\\nencode, and enforce safety thresholds, ViSafe can provide provably safe runtime\\nguarantees for self-separation in high-speed aerial operations. We evaluate\\nViSafe's performance through an extensive test campaign involving both\\nsimulated digital twins and real-world flight scenarios. By independently\\nvarying agent types, closure rates, interaction geometries, and environmental\\nconditions (e.g., weather and lighting), we demonstrate that ViSafe\\nconsistently ensures self-separation across diverse scenarios. In\\nfirst-of-its-kind real-world high-speed collision avoidance tests with closure\\nrates reaching 144 km/h, ViSafe sets a new benchmark for vision-only autonomous\\ncollision avoidance, establishing a new standard for safety in high-speed\\naerial navigation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T16:59:54Z\"}"}
