Our focus is on the leaves of the\\ntotally real distribution, and we investigate the properties of leaves as a\\nRiemannian submanifold. In particular, we prove that any leaf is a totally\\ngeodesic submanifold of the orbit. Additionally, we explore the conditions\\nunder which each leaf becomes a totally geodesic submanifold of the ambient\\nspace. The integrability of the complex distribution is also studied. Moreover,\\nwe analyze a contact structure of orbits where the rank of the totally real\\ndistribution is 1. We obtain a classification of the orbits that possess either\\na contact structure or a Sasakian structure compatible with the complex\\nstructure on the ambient space. Furthermore, we classify those Sasaki orbits\\nthat are Einstein with respect to the induced metric. Specifically, we\\ncompletely detemine Sasaki-Einstein orbits.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T07:32:14Z\"}"}
