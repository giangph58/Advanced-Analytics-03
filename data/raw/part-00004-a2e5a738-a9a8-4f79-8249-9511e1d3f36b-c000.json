{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12672v1\", \"title\": \"Post-processing improves accuracy of Artificial Intelligence weather\\n  forecasts\", \"summary\": \"Artificial Intelligence (AI) weather models are now reaching\\noperational-grade performance for some variables, but like traditional\\nNumerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, they exhibit systematic biases and\\nreliability issues. We test the application of the Bureau of Meteorology's\\nexisting statistical post-processing system, IMPROVER, to ECMWF's deterministic\\nArtificial Intelligence Forecasting System (AIFS), and compare results against\\npost-processed outputs from the ECMWF HRES and ENS models. Without any\\nmodification to configuration or processing workflows, post-processing yields\\ncomparable accuracy improvements for AIFS as for traditional NWP forecasts, in\\nboth expected value and probabilistic outputs. We show that blending AIFS with\\nNWP models improves overall forecast skill, even when AIFS alone is not the\\nmost accurate component. These findings show that statistical post-processing\\nmethods developed for NWP are directly applicable to AI models, enabling\\nnational meteorological centres to incorporate AI forecasts into existing\\nworkflows in a low-risk, incremental fashion.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ao-ph,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T06:05:10Z\"}"}
