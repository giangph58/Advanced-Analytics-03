{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06210v1\", \"title\": \"HiMoR: Monocular Deformable Gaussian Reconstruction with Hierarchical\\n  Motion Representation\", \"summary\": \"We present Hierarchical Motion Representation (HiMoR), a novel deformation\\nrepresentation for 3D Gaussian primitives capable of achieving high-quality\\nmonocular dynamic 3D reconstruction. The insight behind HiMoR is that motions\\nin everyday scenes can be decomposed into coarser motions that serve as the\\nfoundation for finer details. Using a tree structure, HiMoR's nodes represent\\ndifferent levels of motion detail, with shallower nodes modeling coarse motion\\nfor temporal smoothness and deeper nodes capturing finer motion. Additionally,\\nour model uses a few shared motion bases to represent motions of different sets\\nof nodes, aligning with the assumption that motion tends to be smooth and\\nsimple. This motion representation design provides Gaussians with a more\\nstructured deformation, maximizing the use of temporal relationships to tackle\\nthe challenging task of monocular dynamic 3D reconstruction. We also propose\\nusing a more reliable perceptual metric as an alternative, given that\\npixel-level metrics for evaluating monocular dynamic 3D reconstruction can\\nsometimes fail to accurately reflect the true quality of reconstruction.\\nExtensive experiments demonstrate our method's efficacy in achieving superior\\nnovel view synthesis from challenging monocular videos with complex motions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T16:55:12Z\"}"}
