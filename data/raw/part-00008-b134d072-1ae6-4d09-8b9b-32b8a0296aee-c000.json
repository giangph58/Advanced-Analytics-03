Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)\\nprovide an excellent tunable model system to study the interplay between\\ntime-reversal and space-inversion symmetry, since both can be engineered on\\ndemand by tuning the number of layers and via all-optical bandgap modulation.\\nIn this work, we modulate and study time-reversal symmetry using third harmonic\\nKerr rotation in mono- and bilayer TMDs. By illuminating the samples with\\nelliptically polarized light, we achieve spin-selective bandgap modulation and\\nconsequent breaking of time-reversal symmetry. The reduced symmetry modifies\\nthe nonlinear susceptibility tensor, causing a rotation of the emitted third\\nharmonic polarization. With this method, we are able to probe broken\\ntime-reversal symmetry in both non-centrosymmetric (monolayer) and\\ncentrosymmetric (bilayer) crystals. Furthermore, we discuss how the detected\\nthird harmonic rotation angle directly links to the spin-valley locking in\\nmonolayer TMDs and to the spin-valley-layer locking in bilayer TMDs. Thus, our\\nresults define a powerful approach to study broken time-reversal symmetry in\\ncrystals regardless of space-inversion symmetry, and shed light on the spin,\\nvalley and layer coupling of atomically thin semiconductors.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T15:46:24Z\"}"}
