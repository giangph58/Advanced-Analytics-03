The\\ndeployment of automated vehicles (AVs) in such systems introduces a new\\nchallenge: achieving consensus across safety, interaction quality, and traffic\\nperformance. In this work, we position consensus as a fundamental property of\\nthe traffic system and aim to quantify it. We use high-resolution trajectory\\ndata from the Third Generation Simulation (TGSIM) dataset to empirically\\nanalyze AV and human-driven vehicle (HDV) behavior at a signalized urban\\nintersection and around vulnerable road users (VRUs). Key metrics, including\\nTime-to-Collision (TTC), Post-Encroachment Time (PET), deceleration patterns,\\nheadways, and string stability, are evaluated across the three performance\\ndimensions. Results show that full consensus across safety, interaction, and\\nperformance is rare, with only 1.63% of AV-VRU interaction frames meeting all\\nthree conditions. These findings highlight the need for AV models that\\nexplicitly balance multi-dimensional performance in mixed-traffic environments.\\nFull reproducibility is supported via our open-source codebase on\\nhttps://github.com/wissamkontar/Consensus-AV-Analysis.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MA\", \"categories\": \"cs.MA,cs.AI,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T12:59:59Z\"}"}
