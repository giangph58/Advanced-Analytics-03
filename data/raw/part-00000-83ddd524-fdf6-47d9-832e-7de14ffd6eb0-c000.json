Traditional sampling\\nmethods like molecular dynamics (MD) or MCMC often struggle with the\\nhigh-dimensional nature of molecular systems and the high energy barriers of\\ntransitions between stable states. While these transitions are rare events in\\nsimulation timescales, they often represent the most biologically significant\\nprocesses - for example, the conformational change of an ion channel protein\\nfrom its closed to open state, which controls cellular ion flow and is crucial\\nfor neural signaling. Such transitions in real systems may take milliseconds to\\nseconds but could require months or years of continuous simulation to observe\\neven once. We present a method that reformulates transition path generation as\\na continuous optimization problem solved through physics-informed neural\\nnetworks (PINNs) inspired by string methods for minimum-energy path (MEP)\\ngeneration. By representing transition paths as implicit neural functions and\\nleveraging automatic differentiation with differentiable molecular dynamics\\nforce fields, our method enables the efficient discovery of physically\\nrealistic transition pathways without requiring expensive path sampling. We\\ndemonstrate our method's effectiveness on two proteins, including an explicitly\\nhydrated bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) system with over 8,300\\natoms.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph,cs.AI,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T03:02:29Z\"}"}
