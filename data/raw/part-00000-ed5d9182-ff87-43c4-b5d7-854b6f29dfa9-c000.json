{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11966v1\", \"title\": \"Exploring Video-Based Driver Activity Recognition under Noisy Labels\", \"summary\": \"As an open research topic in the field of deep learning, learning with noisy\\nlabels has attracted much attention and grown rapidly over the past ten years.\\nLearning with label noise is crucial for driver distraction behavior\\nrecognition, as real-world video data often contains mislabeled samples,\\nimpacting model reliability and performance. However, label noise learning is\\nbarely explored in the driver activity recognition field. In this paper, we\\npropose the first label noise learning approach for the driver activity\\nrecognition task. Based on the cluster assumption, we initially enable the\\nmodel to learn clustering-friendly low-dimensional representations from given\\nvideos and assign the resultant embeddings into clusters. We subsequently\\nperform co-refinement within each cluster to smooth the classifier outputs.\\nFurthermore, we propose a flexible sample selection strategy that combines two\\nselection criteria without relying on any hyperparameters to filter clean\\nsamples from the training dataset. We also incorporate a self-adaptive\\nparameter into the sample selection process to enforce balancing across\\nclasses. A comprehensive variety of experiments on the public Drive&Act dataset\\nfor all granularity levels demonstrates the superior performance of our method\\nin comparison with other label-denoising methods derived from the image\\nclassification field.
