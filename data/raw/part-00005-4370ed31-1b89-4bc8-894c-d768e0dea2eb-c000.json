The energy-momentum tensor contains the\\ncontribution of a current related to the flow and the metric tensor does an\\noff-diagonal component to balance with the flow momentum. The presence of the\\noff-diagonal component of the metric implies the radial motion of the reference\\nframe, which gives rise to a problem how the relativistic effect is included in\\nthermodynamic observables for such a general relativistic system. This problem\\nis solved by taking an instantaneously rest frame in which geometric\\nthermodynamic observables read as previously and giving them the special\\nrelativistic effect emerged from the inverse transformation to the original\\nframe pointwise. The solution of the thermodynamic observables in accord with\\nthe laws of thermodynamics and the theory of relativity is presented. Finally\\nthe relativistic structure equations for the equilibrium are derived, from\\nwhich the general relativistic Poisson equation as well as the heat conduction\\none are developed exactly.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.SR,hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T08:42:20Z\"}"}

With an increasing patient load, single-isocenter\\ntreatments on widely available C-arm linear accelerators are an attractive\\noption. However, the planning of such treatments is challenging for\\nmulti-target cases due to the island blocking problem, which occurs when the\\nmulti-leaf collimator cannot conform to all targets simultaneously.\\n  Purpose: We propose a multi-target partitioning algorithm that mitigates\\nexcessive exposure of normal tissue caused by the island blocking problem.\\n  Methods: The algorithm divides (partitions) the set of targets into subsets\\nto treat with separate arc passes, optimizing both subsets and collimator\\nangles to minimize island blocking. The algorithm was incorporated into a fully\\nautomated treatment planning script and evaluated on 20 simulated patient\\ncases, each with 10 brain metastases and 21 Gy prescriptions. It was also\\nretrospectively evaluated on six clinical cases.\\n  Results: Partitioning significantly improved the gradient index, global\\nefficiency index, and brain V12Gy compared to simultaneous treatment of all\\nmetastases. For example, the average gradient index improved from 5.9 to 3.3,\\nglobal efficiency index from 0.32 to 0.46, and normal brain V12Gy from 49 cm3\\nto 26 cm3 between 3 and 9 arcs. The proposed algorithm outperformed baselines\\nin utilizing a limited number of arcs. All target partitioning strategies\\nincreased the total number of monitor units (MUs).\\n  Conclusions: The dose gradient in single-isocenter VMAT plans can be\\nsubstantially improved by treating a smaller subset of metastases at a time.\\nThis requires more MUs and arcs, implying a trade-off between delivery time and\\nplan quality which can be explored using the algorithm proposed in this paper.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.med-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.med-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T09:02:57Z\"}"}

However, standalone IDS deployments often fall short when addressing\\nthe increasing complexity and scale of modern cyberattacks. This paper proposes\\na Collaborative Intrusion Detection System (CIDS) that leverages Snort, an\\nopen-source network intrusion detection system, to enhance detection accuracy\\nand reduce false positives. The proposed architecture connects multiple Snort\\nIDS nodes to a centralised node and integrates with a Security Information and\\nEvent Management (SIEM) platform to facilitate real-time data sharing,\\ncorrelation, and analysis. The CIDS design includes a scalable configuration of\\nSnort sensors, a centralised database for log storage, and LogScale SIEM for\\nadvanced analytics and visualisation. By aggregating and analysing intrusion\\ndata from multiple nodes, the system enables improved detection of distributed\\nand sophisticated attack patterns that standalone IDSs may miss. Performance\\nevaluation against simulated attacks, including Nmap port scans and ICMP flood\\nattacks, demonstrates our CIDS's ability to efficiently process large-scale\\nnetwork traffic, detect threats with higher accuracy, and reduce alert fatigue.\\nThis paper highlights the potential of CIDS in modern network environments and\\nexplores future enhancements, such as integrating machine learning for advanced\\nthreat detection and creating public datasets to support collaborative\\nresearch.
