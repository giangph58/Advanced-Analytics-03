{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23737v1\", \"title\": \"Realization of a non-Hermitian Haldane model in circuits\", \"summary\": \"The Haldane model is the simplest yet most powerful topological lattice model\\nexhibiting various phases, including the Dirac semimetal phase and the\\nanomalous quantum Hall phase (also known as the Chern insulator). Although\\nconsidered unlikely to be physically directly realizable in condensed matter\\nsystems, it has been experimentally demonstrated in other physical settings\\nsuch as cold atoms, where Hermiticity is usually preserved. Extending this\\nmodel to the non-Hermitian regime with energy non-conservation can\\nsignificantly enrich topological phases that lack Hermitian counterparts;\\nhowever, such exploration remains experimentally challenging due to the lack of\\nsuitable physical platforms. Here, based on electric circuits, we report the\\nexperimental realization of a genuine non-Hermitian Haldane model with\\nasymmetric next-nearest-neighbor hopping. We observe two previously uncovered\\nphases: a non-Hermitian Chern insulator and a non-Hermitian semimetal phase,\\nboth exhibiting boundary-dependent amplifying or dissipative chiral edge\\nstates. Our work paves the way for exploring non-Hermiticity-induced\\nunconventional topological phases in the Haldane model.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T05:26:39Z\"}"}
