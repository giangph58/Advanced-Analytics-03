Lattice QCD ensembles from the CLS consortium with $m_{\\\\pi} \\\\sim\\n280$ MeV, $a\\\\sim0.09$ fm and $L/a = 24, 32$ are utilized. Finite-volume spectra\\nare determined via variational analysis of two-point correlation matrices,\\ncomputed using large bases of operators resembling bilocal two-meson structures\\nwithin the distillation framework. The scattering matrix for partial wave $l=0$\\nis determined using lattice eigenenergies from multiple inertial frames\\nfollowing L\\\\\\\"uscher's formalism as well as following the solutions of\\nLippmann-Schwinger Equation in the finite-volume on a plane-wave basis. We\\nobserve small nonzero energy shifts in the simulated spectra from the\\nnoninteracting scenario in both the channels studied, which points to rather\\nweak nontrivial interactions between the mesons involved. Despite the nonzero\\nenergy shifts, the lattice-extracted $S$-wave amplitudes do not carry\\nsignatures of any hadron pole features in the physical amplitudes in the energy\\nregion near the threshold.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-lat\", \"categories\": \"hep-lat,hep-ex,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T17:59:54Z\"}"}
