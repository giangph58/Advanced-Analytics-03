{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01657v1\", \"title\": \"Impact of Small-Scale Gravity Waves on Tracer Transport\", \"summary\": \"Small-scale gravity waves play a crucial role in atmospheric tracer\\ntransport, yet their effects remain unresolved in climate models and must be\\nparameterized. This study investigates how gravity waves influence large-scale\\ntracer distributions, utilizing a multiple-scale analysis to systematically\\nidentify the governing terms of gravity wave-induced tracer fluxes. The\\nanalysis reveals both leading-order and next-order impacts: the former being\\nthe inertia-gravity wave-induced tracer Stokes drift, which acts perpendicular\\nto both the large-scale tracer gradient and the wave number, while the latter\\nbecomes significant at lower latitudes where Coriolis effects diminish. A\\nnumerical framework is developed to incorporate these fluxes into a gravity\\nwave parameterization model, potentially enhancing climate model accuracy\\nwithout requiring explicit resolution of small-scale wave dynamics. Model\\nvalidation against high-resolution wave-resolving simulations confirms the\\neffectiveness of this approach. By improving the representation of gravity\\nwave-induced tracer transport, this research advances the accuracy of climate\\nsimulations, particularly in their depiction of microphysics and radiative\\nprocesses.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ao-ph,physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:05:03Z\"}"}
