In addition to exploring the physical aspect of jerks, we tackle\\nthe empirical observation of an attractive force between passengers in the\\npopular attraction, the spinning teacups. By modeling the complex system of\\nrotating platforms, we show that pseudotorques induced by changing acceleration\\nlead to jerky movements and an attractive interaction among riders. Our\\nnumerical analysis confirms the empirical observations, highlighting the\\nconnection between attraction and jerks.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.class-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.class-ph,physics.pop-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T12:30:57Z\"}"}
