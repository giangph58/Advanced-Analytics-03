We extend this method to black holes\\ncoupled with electromagnetic field and cosmological constant by allowing the\\nmaster functions to be linear combinations of the metric and\\nelectromagnetic-potential perturbations, as well as their first-order\\nderivatives. Requiring these master functions satisfy wave equations with\\nyet-to-be-determined effective potentials, we reduce the linearized\\nEinstein-Maxwell system to a set of algebraic-differential constraints. Solving\\nthese constraints reveals four master function branches in each parity sector:\\ntwo standard branches, which coincide with the Zerilli-Moncrief formalism, and\\ntwo Darboux branches, characterized by their effective potentials. Within each\\nparity sector, a Darboux transformation exists which connects the standard and\\nDarboux branches, preserving the quasinormal mode spectrum and confirming their\\nphysical equivalence.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T13:43:56Z\"}"}
