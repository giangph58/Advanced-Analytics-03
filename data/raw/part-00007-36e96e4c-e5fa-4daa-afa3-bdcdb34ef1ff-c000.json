{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10287v1\", \"title\": \"From translations to non-collapsing logic combinations\", \"summary\": \"Prawitz suggested expanding a natural deduction system for intuitionistic\\nlogic to include rules for classical logic constructors, allowing both\\nintuitionistic and classical elements to coexist without losing their inherent\\ncharacteristics. Looking at the added rules from the point of view of the\\nGodel-Gentzen translation, led us to propose a general method for the\\ncoexistent combination of two logics when a conservative translation exists\\nfrom one logic (the source) to another (the host). Then we prove that the\\ncombined logic is a conservative extension of the original logics, thereby\\npreserving the unique characteristics of each component logic. In this way\\nthere is no collapse of one logic into the other in the combination. We also\\ndemonstrate that a Gentzen calculus for the combined logic can be induced from\\na Gentzen calculus for the host logic by considering the translation. This\\napproach applies to semantics as well. We then establish a general sufficient\\ncondition for ensuring that the combined logic is both sound and complete. We\\napply these principles by combining classical and intuitionistic logics\\ncapitalizing on the Godel-Gentzen conservative translation, intuitionistic and\\nS4 modal logics relying on the Godel-McKinsey-Tarski conservative translation,\\nand classical and Jaskowski's paraconsistent logics taking into account the\\nexistence of a conservative translation.\", \"main_category\": \"math.LO\", \"categories\": \"math.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T14:55:11Z\"}"}
