By explicitly including a second-excited state for each chromophore,\\nwe simulate A-2DES spectra ranging from the non-interacting limit to the\\nstrong-coupling case, focusing on the significance of cross peaks. While for\\nweak excitonic coupling, cross peaks can be understood as the incoherent mixing\\nof linear signals of the two chromophores, these features reflect excitonic\\ndelocalization as the coupling increases. We highlight that A-2DES offers\\nenhanced sensitivity to coherent excited-state dynamics, particularly in the\\nintermediate-coupling regime, where it provides higher contrast compared to its\\ncoherent-detected counterpart. Finally, we show that static disorder reduces\\nthe relative amplitude of cross peaks compared to diagonal features in a way\\nthat depends on the excitonic coupling. Notably, the relative suppression of\\ncross peaks decreases with the strength of the excitonic coupling, implying\\nthat spectral features related to incoherent mixing are less prominent in\\ninhomogeneous samples. These findings support the potential of A-2DES for\\ninvestigating excitonic dynamics in small multi-chromophoric systems.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:51:47Z\"}"}
