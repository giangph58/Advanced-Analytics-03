Let $t$ and $\\\\mathrm{OPT}$ be the\\ncapacity and the optimal value, respectively.

This running time is the best\\npossible (up to a logarithmic factor), assuming that $(\\\\min,+)$-convolution\\ncannot be solved in truly subquadratic time [K\\\\\\\"unnemann, Paturi, and Schneider\\n'17][Cygan, Mucha, W\\\\k{e}grzycki, and W{\\\\l}odarczyk '19]. The same upper and\\nlower bounds hold if one seeks a solution with total profit at least\\n$\\\\mathrm{OPT}$ and total weight at most $(1 + \\\\varepsilon)t$.
