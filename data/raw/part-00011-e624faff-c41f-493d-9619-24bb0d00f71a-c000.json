{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11309v1\", \"title\": \"Big Brother is Watching: Proactive Deepfake Detection via Learnable\\n  Hidden Face\", \"summary\": \"As deepfake technologies continue to advance, passive detection methods\\nstruggle to generalize with various forgery manipulations and datasets.\\nProactive defense techniques have been actively studied with the primary aim of\\npreventing deepfake operation effectively working. In this paper, we aim to\\nbridge the gap between passive detection and proactive defense, and seek to\\nsolve the detection problem utilizing a proactive methodology. Inspired by\\nseveral watermarking-based forensic methods, we explore a novel detection\\nframework based on the concept of ``hiding a learnable face within a face''.\\nSpecifically, relying on a semi-fragile invertible steganography network, a\\nsecret template image is embedded into a host image imperceptibly, acting as an\\nindicator monitoring for any malicious image forgery when being restored by the\\ninverse steganography process. Instead of being manually specified, the secret\\ntemplate is optimized during training to resemble a neutral facial appearance,\\njust like a ``big brother'' hidden in the image to be protected. By\\nincorporating a self-blending mechanism and robustness learning strategy with a\\nsimulative transmission channel, a robust detector is built to accurately\\ndistinguish if the steganographic image is maliciously tampered or benignly\\nprocessed. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets\\ndemonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over competing passive and\\nproactive detection methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:50:54Z\"}"}
