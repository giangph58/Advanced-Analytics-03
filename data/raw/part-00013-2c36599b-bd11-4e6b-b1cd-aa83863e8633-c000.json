{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04446v1\", \"title\": \"Practice Support for Violin Bowing by Measuring Bow Pressure and\\n  Position\", \"summary\": \"The violin is one of the most popular musical instruments. Various parameters\\nof bowing motion, such as pressure, position, and speed, are crucial for\\nproducing a beautiful tone. However, mastering them is challenging and requires\\nextensive practice. In this study, we aimed to support practice of bowing,\\nfocusing on bow pressure. First, we compared the bowing movements, specifically\\nbow pressure, bow position, and bow speed, of eight experienced players with\\nthose of eight beginners. Next, we developed and evaluated a visual feedback\\nsystem that displays bow pressure to support practice. We taught the identified\\ndifferences to 14 beginners, dividing them into two groups: one practiced with\\nan explanation, and the other with both an explanation and a feedback system.\\nThese two experiments found that clarifying the characteristics unique to\\nexperienced players can support practice.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,H.5.2\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:16:30Z\"}"}
