{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21395v1\", \"title\": \"On the magic positivity of Ehrhart polynomials of dilated polytopes\", \"summary\": \"A polynomial $f(x)$ of degree $d$ is said to be magic positive if all the\\ncoefficients are non-negative when $f(x)$ is expanded with respect to the basis\\n$\\\\{x^i(x+1)^{d-i}\\\\}_{i=0}^d$. It is known that if $f(x)$ is magic positive,\\nthen the polynomial appearing in the numerator of its generating function is\\nreal-rooted. In this paper, we show that for a polynomial $f(x)$ with positive\\nreal coefficients, there exists a positive real number $k$ such that $f(k'x)$\\nis magic positive for any $k' \\\\geq k$. Furthermore, for any integer $d\\\\geq3$,\\nwe show the existence of a $d$-dimensional polytope $P$ such that the Ehrhart\\npolynomial of $kP$ is not magic positive for a given integer $k$. Finally, we\\ninvestigate how much certain polytopes need to be dilated to make their Ehrhart\\npolynomials magic positive.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T07:52:06Z\"}"}
