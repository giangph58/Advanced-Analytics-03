In particular, if $\\\\theta$ is of\\nbounded type, then the Julia set of the sine function $S_\\\\theta(z)=e^{2\\\\pi\\ni\\\\theta}\\\\sin(z)$ is locally connected. Moreover, we prove the existence of\\ntranscendental entire functions having Siegel disks and locally connected Julia\\nsets with asymptotic values.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS,math.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T04:48:26Z\"}"}
