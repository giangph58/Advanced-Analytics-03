{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05218v1\", \"title\": \"Hybrid machine learning data assimilation for marine biogeochemistry\", \"summary\": \"Marine biogeochemistry models are critical for forecasting, as well as\\nestimating ecosystem responses to climate change and human activities. Data\\nassimilation (DA) improves these models by aligning them with real-world\\nobservations, but marine biogeochemistry DA faces challenges due to model\\ncomplexity, strong nonlinearity, and sparse, uncertain observations. Existing\\nDA methods applied to marine biogeochemistry struggle to update unobserved\\nvariables effectively, while ensemble-based methods are computationally too\\nexpensive for high-complexity marine biogeochemistry models. This study\\ndemonstrates how machine learning (ML) can improve marine biogeochemistry DA by\\nlearning statistical relationships between observed and unobserved variables.\\nWe integrate ML-driven balancing schemes into a 1D prototype of a system used\\nto forecast marine biogeochemistry in the North-West European Shelf seas. ML is\\napplied to predict (i) state-dependent correlations from free-run ensembles and\\n(ii), in an ``end-to-end'' fashion, analysis increments from an Ensemble Kalman\\nFilter. Our results show that ML significantly enhances updates for previously\\nnot-updated variables when compared to univariate schemes akin to those used\\noperationally. Furthermore, ML models exhibit moderate transferability to new\\nlocations, a crucial step toward scaling these methods to 3D operational\\nsystems. We conclude that ML offers a clear pathway to overcome current\\ncomputational bottlenecks in marine biogeochemistry DA and that refining\\ntransferability, optimizing training data sampling, and evaluating scalability\\nfor large-scale marine forecasting, should be future research priorities.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ao-ph,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T16:04:10Z\"}"}
