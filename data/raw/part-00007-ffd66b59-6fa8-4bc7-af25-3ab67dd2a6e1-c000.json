Despite progress in fixed\\ndimensions (e.g., dimension 4 codes by Ding and Tang \\\\cite{Ding2020}),\\nconstructing NMDS codes with arbitrary dimensions supporting $t$-designs\\n($t\\\\geq 2$) has remained open. In this paper, we construct two infinite\\nfamilies of NMDS codes over $\\\\mathbb{F}_q$ for any prime power $q$ with\\nflexible dimensions and determine their weight distributions. Further, two\\nadditional families with arbitrary dimensions over $\\\\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$\\nsupporting $2$-designs and $3$-designs, and their weight distributions are\\nobtained. Our results fully generalize prior fixed-dimension\\nworks~\\\\cite{DingY2024,Heng2023,Heng20231,Xu2022}, and affirmatively settle the\\nHeng-Wang conjecture \\\\cite{Heng2023} on the existence of NMDS codes with\\nflexible parameters supporting $2$-designs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T03:02:10Z\"}"}
