{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17709v1\", \"title\": \"Fault Diagnosis in New Wind Turbines using Knowledge from Existing\\n  Turbines by Generative Domain Adaptation\", \"summary\": \"Intelligent condition monitoring of wind turbines is essential for reducing\\ndowntimes. Machine learning models trained on wind turbine operation data are\\ncommonly used to detect anomalies and, eventually, operation faults. However,\\ndata-driven normal behavior models (NBMs) require a substantial amount of\\ntraining data, as NBMs trained with scarce data may result in unreliable fault\\ndiagnosis. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel generative deep\\nlearning approach to make SCADA samples from one wind turbine lacking training\\ndata resemble SCADA data from wind turbines with representative training data.\\nThrough CycleGAN-based domain mapping, our method enables the application of an\\nNBM trained on an existing wind turbine to one with severely limited data. We\\ndemonstrate our approach on field data mapping SCADA samples across 7\\nsubstantially different WTs. Our findings show significantly improved fault\\ndiagnosis in wind turbines with scarce data. Our method achieves the most\\nsimilar anomaly scores to an NBM trained with abundant data, outperforming NBMs\\ntrained on scarce training data with improvements of +10.3% in F1-score when 1\\nmonth of training data is available and +16.8% when 2 weeks are available. The\\ndomain mapping approach outperforms conventional fine-tuning at all considered\\ndegrees of data scarcity, ranging from 1 to 8 weeks of training data. The\\nproposed technique enables earlier and more reliable fault diagnosis in newly\\ninstalled wind farms, demonstrating a novel and promising research direction to\\nimprove anomaly detection when faced with training data scarcity.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T16:14:04Z\"}"}
