Survival\\ninformation may be lost to follow-up or the birthdate may be missing. The data\\ncan still be modeled as a truncated point process and it is close to a Poisson\\nprocess, in the Hellinger distance, as long as the sample is small relative to\\nthe population. We assume an exponential distribution for the lifespan, derive\\nthe likelihood and profile out the unobservable sample size. Identification of\\nthe exponential parameter is shown, together with consistency and asymptotic\\nnormality of its M-estimator. Even though the estimator sequence is indexed in\\nthe sample size, both the point estimator and the standard error are\\nobservable. Enterprise lifespans in Germany constitute our example.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T11:29:31Z\"}"}
