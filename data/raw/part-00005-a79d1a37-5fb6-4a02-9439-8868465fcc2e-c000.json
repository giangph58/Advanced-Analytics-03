{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11165v1\", \"title\": \"YOLO-RS: Remote Sensing Enhanced Crop Detection Methods\", \"summary\": \"With the rapid development of remote sensing technology, crop classification\\nand health detection based on deep learning have gradually become a research\\nhotspot. However, the existing target detection methods show poor performance\\nwhen dealing with small targets in remote sensing images, especially in the\\ncase of complex background and image mixing, which is difficult to meet the\\npractical application requirementsite. To address this problem, a novel target\\ndetection model YOLO-RS is proposed in this paper. The model is based on the\\nlatest Yolov11 which significantly enhances the detection of small targets by\\nintroducing the Context Anchor Attention (CAA) mechanism and an efficient\\nmulti-field multi-scale feature fusion network. YOLO-RS adopts a bidirectional\\nfeature fusion strategy in the feature fusion process, which effectively\\nenhances the model's performance in the detection of small targets. Small\\ntarget detection. Meanwhile, the ACmix module at the end of the model backbone\\nnetwork solves the category imbalance problem by adaptively adjusting the\\ncontrast and sample mixing, thus enhancing the detection accuracy in complex\\nscenes. In the experiments on the PDT remote sensing crop health detection\\ndataset and the CWC crop classification dataset, YOLO-RS improves both the\\nrecall and the mean average precision (mAP) by about 2-3\\\\% or so compared with\\nthe existing state-of-the-art methods, while the F1-score is also significantly\\nimproved. Moreover, the computational complexity of the model only increases by\\nabout 5.2 GFLOPs, indicating its significant advantages in both performance and\\nefficiency. The experimental results validate the effectiveness and application\\npotential of YOLO-RS in the task of detecting small targets in remote sensing\\nimages.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T13:13:22Z\"}"}
