Our formulation allows for both large-scale topology\\noptimization and few-variable parametrized-geometry optimization. It is an\\nextension of a quasi-normal mode theory and analytical filter-design criteria\\n(on the system resonances and background response) derived in our previous\\nwork. Our new optimization-oriented formulation relies solely on a scattering\\nsolver and imposes these design criteria as equality constraints with easily\\ncalculated (via the adjoint method) derivatives, so that our algorithm is\\nnumerically tractable, robust, and well-suited for large-scale inverse design.\\nWe demonstrate its effectiveness by designing 3rd- and 4th-order elliptic and\\nChebyshev filters for photonic metasurfaces, multilayer films, and electrical\\nLC-ladder circuits.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.app-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T13:37:04Z\"}"}
