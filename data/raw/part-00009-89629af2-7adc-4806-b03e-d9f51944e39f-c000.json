When a pilot\\nstudy is available, we recommend sample-based EW D-optimal designs for\\nsubsequent experiments. Otherwise, we recommend EW D-optimal designs under a\\nprior distribution for model parameters. We propose an EW ForLion algorithm for\\nfinding EW D-optimal designs under a general parametric model, and justify that\\nthe designs found by our algorithm are EW D-optimal. To facilitate potential\\nusers in practice, we also develop a rounding algorithm that converts an\\napproximate design with mixed factors to an exact design with prespecified grid\\npoints and the number of experimental units. By applying our algorithms for\\nreal experiments under multinomial logistic models or generalized linear\\nmodels, we show that our designs are highly efficient with respect to locally\\nD-optimal designs and more robust against parameter value misspecifications.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T16:06:59Z\"}"}
