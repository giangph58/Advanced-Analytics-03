{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11949v1\", \"title\": \"Flow Intelligence: Robust Feature Matching via Temporal Signature\\n  Correlation\", \"summary\": \"Feature matching across video streams remains a cornerstone challenge in\\ncomputer vision. Increasingly, robust multimodal matching has garnered interest\\nin robotics, surveillance, remote sensing, and medical imaging. While\\ntraditional rely on detecting and matching spatial features, they break down\\nwhen faced with noisy, misaligned, or cross-modal data. Recent deep learning\\nmethods have improved robustness through learned representations, but remain\\nconstrained by their dependence on extensive training data and computational\\ndemands. We present Flow Intelligence, a paradigm-shifting approach that moves\\nbeyond spatial features by focusing on temporal motion patterns exclusively.\\nInstead of detecting traditional keypoints, our method extracts motion\\nsignatures from pixel blocks across consecutive frames and extract temporal\\nmotion signatures between videos. These motion-based descriptors achieve\\nnatural invariance to translation, rotation, and scale variations while\\nremaining robust across different imaging modalities. This novel approach also\\nrequires no pretraining data, eliminates the need for spatial feature\\ndetection, enables cross-modal matching using only temporal motion, and it\\noutperforms existing methods in challenging scenarios where traditional\\napproaches fail. By leveraging motion rather than appearance, Flow Intelligence\\nenables robust, real-time video feature matching in diverse environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T10:25:20Z\"}"}
