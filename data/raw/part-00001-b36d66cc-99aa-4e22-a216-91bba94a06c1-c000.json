The\\nfall-off conditions are consistent with a finite, non-trivial presymplectic\\ncurrent on the future boundary of de Sitter. Hence our result allows a non-zero\\ngravitational flux across the boundary of the de Sitter. We present an explicit\\ngauge-free computation to show that the Gibbons-Hawking boundary term,\\ncounterterm in the action, and fall-off condition of gravitational field in\\nconformal Einstein equation are crucial to reproduce the finite symplectic\\nflux.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T15:17:33Z\"}"}
