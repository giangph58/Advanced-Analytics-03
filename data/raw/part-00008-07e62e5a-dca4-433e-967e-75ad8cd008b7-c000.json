{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07736v1\", \"title\": \"A Novel Deep Learning Approach for Emulating Computationally Expensive\\n  Postfire Debris Flows\", \"summary\": \"Traditional physics-based models of geophysical flows, such as debris flows\\nand landslides that pose significant risks to human lives and infrastructure\\nare computationally expensive, limiting their utility for large-scale parameter\\nsweeps, uncertainty quantification, inversions or real-time applications. This\\nstudy presents an efficient alternative, a deep learning-based surrogate model\\nbuilt using a modified U-Net architecture to predict the dynamics of\\nrunoff-generated debris flows across diverse terrain based on data from physics\\nbased simulations. The study area is divided into smaller patches for localized\\npredictions using a patch-predict-stitch methodology (complemented by limited\\nglobal data to accelerate training). The patches are then combined to\\nreconstruct spatially continuous flow maps, ensuring scalability for large\\ndomains. To enable fast training using limited expensive simulations, the deep\\nlearning model was trained on data from an ensemble of physics based\\nsimulations using parameters generated via Latin Hypercube Sampling and\\nvalidated on unseen parameter sets and terrain, achieving maximum pointwise\\nerrors below 10% and robust generalization. Uncertainty quantification using\\nMonte Carlo methods are enabled using the validated surrogate, which can\\nfacilitate probabilistic hazard assessments. This study highlights the\\npotential of deep learning surrogates as powerful tools for geophysical flow\\nanalysis, enabling computationally efficient and reliable probabilistic hazard\\nmap predictions.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn,cs.LG,physics.geo-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T13:29:37Z\"}"}
