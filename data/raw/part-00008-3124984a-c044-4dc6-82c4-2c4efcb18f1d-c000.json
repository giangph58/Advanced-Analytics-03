Previous work shows that an environment's color temperature\\naffects the experienced temperature. As virtual reality (VR) enables visual\\nimmersion, recent work suggests that a VR scene's color temperature also\\naffects experienced temperature. In addition, virtual avatars representing\\nthermal cues influence users' thermal perception and even the body temperature.\\nAs immersive technology becomes increasingly prevalent in daily life,\\nleveraging thermal cues to enhance thermal comfort - without relying on actual\\nthermal energy - presents a promising opportunity. Understanding these effects\\nis crucial for optimizing virtual experiences and promoting sustainable energy\\npractices. Therefore, we propose three controlled experiments to learn more\\nabout thermal effects caused by virtual worlds and avatars.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:16:47Z\"}"}
