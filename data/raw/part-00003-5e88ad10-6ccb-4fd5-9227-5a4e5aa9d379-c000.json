Instead of adopting the classical expected\\nutility paradigm, we model the risk preference of each insurer (agent) by his\\nValue-at-Risk at his own chosen risk tolerance level. Under information\\nasymmetry, the reinsurer (principal) aims to maximize her expected profit by\\ndesigning an optimal menu of reinsurance contracts for a continuum of insurers\\nwith hidden characteristics. The optimization problem is constrained by agents'\\nindividual compatibility and rationality constraints. By making use of the\\nnotion of indirect utility functions, the problem is completely solved for the\\nfollowing three commonly encountered classes of reinsurance indemnities:\\nstop-loss, quota-share, and change loss. Some numerical examples are provided\\nas illustrations.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.RM\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.RM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T12:01:35Z\"}"}
