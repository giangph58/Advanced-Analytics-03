{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21704v1\", \"title\": \"Learning to Represent Individual Differences for Choice Decision Making\", \"summary\": \"Human decision making can be challenging to predict because decisions are\\naffected by a number of complex factors. Adding to this complexity,\\ndecision-making processes can differ considerably between individuals, and\\nmethods aimed at predicting human decisions need to take individual differences\\ninto account. Behavioral science offers methods by which to measure individual\\ndifferences (e.g., questionnaires, behavioral models), but these are often\\nnarrowed down to low dimensions and not tailored to specific prediction tasks.\\nThis paper investigates the use of representation learning to measure\\nindividual differences from behavioral experiment data. Representation learning\\noffers a flexible approach to create individual embeddings from data that are\\nboth structured (e.g., demographic information) and unstructured (e.g., free\\ntext), where the flexibility provides more options for individual difference\\nmeasures for personalization, e.g., free text responses may allow for\\nopen-ended questions that are less privacy-sensitive. In the current paper we\\nuse representation learning to characterize individual differences in human\\nperformance on an economic decision-making task. We demonstrate that models\\nusing representation learning to capture individual differences consistently\\nimprove decision predictions over models without representation learning, and\\neven outperform well-known theory-based behavioral models used in these\\nenvironments. Our results propose that representation learning offers a useful\\nand flexible tool to capture individual differences.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:10:05Z\"}"}
