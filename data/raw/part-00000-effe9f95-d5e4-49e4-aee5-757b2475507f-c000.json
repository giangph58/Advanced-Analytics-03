Two pendant $(S,r)$-trees are called\\ninternally-disjoint if they are arc-disjoint and their common vertex set is\\nexactly $S$. The goal of the {\\\\sc Internally-disjoint Directed Pendant Steiner\\nTree Packing (IDPSTP)} problem is to find a largest collection of pairwise\\ninternally-disjoint pendant $(S,r)$-trees in $D$. We use $\\\\tau_{S,r}(D)$ to\\ndenote the maximum number of pairwise internally-disjoint pendant $(S,r)$-trees\\nin $D$ and define the directed pendant-tree $k$-connectivity of $D$ as\\n  \\\\begin{align*}\\n  \\\\tau_{k}(D)=\\\\min\\\\{\\\\tau_{S,r}(D)\\\\mid S\\\\subseteq V(D),|S|=k,r\\\\in S\\\\}.\\n  \\\\end{align*}\\n  IDPSTP is a restriction of the {\\\\sc Internally-disjoint Directed Steiner Tree\\nPacking} problem studied by Cheriyan and Salavatipour [Algorithmica, 2006] and\\nSun and Yeo [JGT, 2023]. The directed pendant-tree $k$-connectivity extends the\\nconcept of pendant-tree $k$-connectivity in undirected graphs studied by Hager\\n[JCTB, 1985] and could be seen as a generalization of classical\\nvertex-connectivity of digraphs.\\n  In this paper, we completely determine the computational complexity for the\\nparameter $\\\\tau_{S,r}(D)$ on Eulerian digraphs and symmetric digraphs. We also\\ngive sharp bounds and values for the parameter $\\\\tau_{k}(D)$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T04:42:02Z\"}"}
