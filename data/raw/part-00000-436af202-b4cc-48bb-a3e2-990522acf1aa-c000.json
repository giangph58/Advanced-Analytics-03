Here\\nthe weights are $1$ on edges not traversed and $\\\\delta\\\\in(0,\\\\infty)$ otherwise.\\nIn detail, we show that its tail distribution decays exponentially, and obtain\\na phase transition of the exponential integrability of the edge cover time with\\ncritical exponent $\\\\alpha_c^1(\\\\delta)$, which has a variational representation\\nand some interesting analytic properties including $\\\\alpha_c^1(0+)$ reflecting\\nthe graph structures.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:28:07Z\"}"}
