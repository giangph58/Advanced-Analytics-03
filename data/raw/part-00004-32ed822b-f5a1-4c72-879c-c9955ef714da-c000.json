Furthermore, we\\nincorporate pseudo-label refinement as well as a specialized data augmentation\\nwith the refined pseudo-labels, resulting in superior performance. We establish\\nstate-of-the-art performance, and provide comprehensive experiments and\\nablation studies to validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T17:59:10Z\"}"}
