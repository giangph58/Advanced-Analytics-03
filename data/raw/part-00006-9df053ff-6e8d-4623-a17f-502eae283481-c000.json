Here, we\\npresent a systematic comparison of the two most widely used approaches to\\ncompute this parameter, linear response theory (LRT) and the constrained\\nrandom-phase approximation (cRPA), using a unified framework based on the use\\nof maximally localized Wannier functions to define the underlying basis sets.\\nWe demonstrate good quantitative agreement between LRT and cRPA in cases where\\nthe strongly interacting subspace corresponds to an isolated set of bands.\\nDifferences can be assigned to neglecting the response of the\\nexchange-correlation potential in cRPA and the presence of additional screening\\nchannels in LRT. Moreover, we show that in cases with strong hybridization\\nbetween interacting and screening subspaces, the application of cRPA becomes\\nambiguous and can lead to unrealistically small U values, while LRT remains\\nwell-behaved. Our work clarifies the relation between both methods, sheds light\\non their strengths and limitations, and emphasizes the importance of using a\\nconsistent set of Wannier orbitals to ensure transferability of U values\\nbetween different implementations.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T17:11:55Z\"}"}
