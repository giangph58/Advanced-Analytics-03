We simulate multipulse\\nexcitations in the Hubbard model using nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field\\ntheory to extract the 2DCS signal of weak-coupling antiferromagnets with and\\nwithout disorder. By comparing calculations with static and dynamic Hartree\\nterms, and analyzing the waiting-time dependence of the signal, we identify the\\ncontribution of the collective amplitude (Higgs) mode to the spectroscopic\\nfeatures and the relevant underlying processes. With broadband pulses, the\\nrephasing and nonrephasing peaks at the gap energy are found to be of\\npredominant Higgs character, while the two-quantum signals originate from\\nsingle-particle excitations. Using narrow-band pulses, we also demonstrate a\\nstrong enhancement of these Higgs-related signals at a pulse frequency of half\\nthe gap size.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T06:19:20Z\"}"}
