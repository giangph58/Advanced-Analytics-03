For solutions with bounded positive sets, we give a\\nclassification in terms of their expansions at infinity. For solutions with\\nbounded contact sets, we show that the contact sets are highly flexible and can\\napproximate arbitrary compact sets.\\n  These phenomena have no counterparts in the classical obstacle problem.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T10:23:10Z\"}"}
