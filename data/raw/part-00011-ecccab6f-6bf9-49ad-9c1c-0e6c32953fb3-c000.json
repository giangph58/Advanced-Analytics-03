The flavor changing meson decay emitting the light $X$ is induced by\\nloop processes where the up-type quarks, the $W$ boson, or charged scalar\\nbosons are running inside loops. We calculate all one-loop diagrams with\\nneglecting all masses of light quarks except for the top quark in a general\\nanomaly free extra $U(1)$ model. Our theoretical evaluation of the branching\\nratio of charged $B$ meson decay and charged kaon decay is compared to\\nexperimental results, and we derive new constraints for dark photon,\\n$U(1)_{B-L}$ and $U(1)_R$ models.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T13:39:26Z\"}"}
