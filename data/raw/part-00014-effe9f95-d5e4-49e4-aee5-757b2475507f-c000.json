{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00312v1\", \"title\": \"AWARE-NET: Adaptive Weighted Averaging for Robust Ensemble Network in\\n  Deepfake Detection\", \"summary\": \"Deepfake detection has become increasingly important due to the rise of\\nsynthetic media, which poses significant risks to digital identity and cyber\\npresence for security and trust. While multiple approaches have improved\\ndetection accuracy, challenges remain in achieving consistent performance\\nacross diverse datasets and manipulation types. In response, we propose a novel\\ntwo-tier ensemble framework for deepfake detection based on deep learning that\\nhierarchically combines multiple instances of three state-of-the-art\\narchitectures: Xception, Res2Net101, and EfficientNet-B7. Our framework employs\\na unique approach where each architecture is instantiated three times with\\ndifferent initializations to enhance model diversity, followed by a learnable\\nweighting mechanism that dynamically combines their predictions. Unlike\\ntraditional fixed-weight ensembles, our first-tier averages predictions within\\neach architecture family to reduce model variance, while the second tier learns\\noptimal contribution weights through backpropagation, automatically adjusting\\neach architecture's influence based on their detection reliability. Our\\nexperiments achieved state-of-the-art intra-dataset performance with AUC scores\\nof 99.22% (FF++) and 100.00% (CelebDF-v2), and F1 scores of 98.06% (FF++) and\\n99.94% (CelebDF-v2) without augmentation. With augmentation, we achieve AUC\\nscores of 99.47% (FF++) and 100.00% (CelebDF-v2), and F1 scores of 98.43%\\n(FF++) and 99.95% (CelebDF-v2). The framework demonstrates robust cross-dataset\\ngeneralization, achieving AUC scores of 88.20% and 72.52%, and F1 scores of\\n93.16% and 80.62% in cross-dataset evaluations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T05:14:50Z\"}"}
