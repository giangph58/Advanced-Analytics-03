To address\\nthis challenge, we propose \\\\textbf{I}mage \\\\textbf{D}ehazing \\\\textbf{D}iffusion\\n\\\\textbf{M}odels (IDDM), a novel diffusion process that incorporates the\\natmospheric scattering model into noise diffusion. IDDM aims to use the gradual\\nhaze formation process to help the denoising Unet robustly learn the\\ndistribution of clear images from the conditional input hazy images. We design\\na specialized training strategy centered around IDDM. Diffusion models are\\nleveraged to bridge the domain gap from synthetic to real-world, while the\\natmospheric scattering model provides physical guidance for haze formation.\\nDuring the forward process, IDDM simultaneously introduces haze and noise into\\nclear images, and then robustly separates them during the sampling process. By\\ntraining with physics-guided information, IDDM shows the ability of domain\\ngeneralization, and effectively restores the real-world hazy images despite\\nbeing trained on synthetic datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\\neffectiveness of our method through both quantitative and qualitative\\ncomparisons with state-of-the-art approaches.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T07:36:10Z\"}"}
