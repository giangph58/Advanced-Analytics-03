However, those properties may be\\nextremely sensitive to structural and chemical modifications. We report a\\ndetailed investigation of the synthesis of the altermagnet {\\\\alpha}-MnTe on\\nGaAs(111) which reveals the bulk defect structure of this material, the\\nmechanism by which it releases strain from the underlying substrate and the\\nimpact of oxidation on its surface. X-ray diffraction measurements show that\\n{\\\\alpha}-MnTe layers with thicknesses spanning 45nm to 640nm acquire lattice\\nparameters different from bulk mostly due to thermal strain caused by the\\nsubstrate rather than strain from the lattice mismatch. Through high resolution\\ntransmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurement, we then unveil a misfit\\ndislocation array at the interface, revealing the mechanism by which lattice\\nstrain is relaxed. TEM also reveals a stacking fault in the bulk, occurring\\nalong a glide plane parallel to the interface. The combination of TEM with\\npolarized neutron reflectometry measurements finally reveals the impact of\\noxidation on the chemistry of the surface of uncapped MnTe. Our findings\\nhighlight the subtle role of epitaxy in altering the structure of {\\\\alpha}-MnTe\\nproviding potential opportunities to tune the altermagnetic properties of this\\nmaterial.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T14:38:43Z\"}"}
