In this paper, we explore some\\ninteresting applications of the matrix tree theorem. In particular, we present\\na combinatorial interpretation of a distribution of $(n-1)^{n-1}$, in the\\ncontext of uprooted spanning trees of the complete graph $K_{n}$, which was\\npreviously obtained by Chauve--Dulucq--Guibert. Furthermore, we establish a\\ncombinatorial explanation for the distribution of $m^{n-1}n^{m-1}$, related to\\nspanning trees of the complete bipartite graph $K_{m,n}$, which seems new.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T05:06:08Z\"}"}
