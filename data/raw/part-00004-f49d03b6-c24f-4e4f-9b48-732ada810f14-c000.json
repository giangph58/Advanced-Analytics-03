{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05306v1\", \"title\": \"CREA: A Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework for Creative Content\\n  Generation with Diffusion Models\", \"summary\": \"Creativity in AI imagery remains a fundamental challenge, requiring not only\\nthe generation of visually compelling content but also the capacity to add\\nnovel, expressive, and artistically rich transformations to images. Unlike\\nconventional editing tasks that rely on direct prompt-based modifications,\\ncreative image editing demands an autonomous, iterative approach that balances\\noriginality, coherence, and artistic intent. To address this, we introduce\\nCREA, a novel multi-agent collaborative framework that mimics the human\\ncreative process. Our framework leverages a team of specialized AI agents who\\ndynamically collaborate to conceptualize, generate, critique, and enhance\\nimages. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we\\ndemonstrate that CREA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in\\ndiversity, semantic alignment, and creative transformation. By structuring\\ncreativity as a dynamic, agentic process, CREA redefines the intersection of AI\\nand art, paving the way for autonomous AI-driven artistic exploration,\\ngenerative design, and human-AI co-creation. To the best of our knowledge, this\\nis the first work to introduce the task of creative editing.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T17:59:51Z\"}"}
