{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05025v1\", \"title\": \"Microscopic phase-transition theory of charge density waves: revealing\\n  hidden transitions of phason and amplitudon\", \"summary\": \"We develop a self-consistent phase-transition theory of charge density waves\\n(CDWs), starting from a purely microscopic model. Specifically, we derive a\\nmicroscopic CDW gap equation $|\\\\Delta_0(T)|$, taking into account of thermal\\nphase fluctuations (i.e., thermal excitation of phason) and their influence on\\nCDW pinning (i.e., the phason mass) and CDW gap. We demonstrate that as\\ntemperature increases from zero, the phason gradually softens, leading to a\\ndepinning transition (where the phason becomes gapless) at $T_d$ and a\\nsubsequent first-order CDW phase transition at $T_c>T_d$. The predicted values\\nof $T_d$, $T_c$ as well as the large ratio of $|\\\\Delta_0(T=0)|/(k_BT_c)$ for\\nthe quasi-one-dimensional CDW material (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I show remarkable\\nquantitative agreements with experimental measurements and explain many of the\\npreviously observed key thermodynamic features and unresolved issues in\\nliterature. To further validate the theory, we calculate the energy gap of CDW\\namplitudon and its lifetime, and reveal a transition of amplitudon from a\\nlightly damped to a heavily damped excitation during pinning-depinning\\ntransition while its energy gap is nearly unchanged throughout the entire CDW\\nphase. This finding quantitatively captures and explains the recently observed\\ncoherent signal in ultrafast THz emission spectroscopy on (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T07:59:39Z\"}"}
