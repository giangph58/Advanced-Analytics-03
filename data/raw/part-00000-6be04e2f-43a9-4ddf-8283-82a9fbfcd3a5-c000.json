{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20919v1\", \"title\": \"Characterizing CMB noise anisotropies from CMB delensing\", \"summary\": \"Un-doing the effect of gravitational lensing on the Cosmic Microwave\\nBackground ('de-lensing') is essential in shaping constraints on weak signals\\nlimited by lensing effects on the CMB, for example on a background of\\nprimordial gravitational waves. Removing these anisotropies induced by\\nlarge-scale structures from the CMB maps also generally helps our view of the\\nprimordial Universe, by sharpening the acoustic peaks and the damping tail.\\nHowever, delensing does transfer parts of these anisotropies to the noise maps.\\nThis will induce a new large scale 'mean-field' bias to any anisotropy\\nestimator applied to the delensed CMB, and this bias directly traces\\nlarge-scale structures. This paper analytically quantifies this delensed noise\\nmean-field and its impact on quadratic (QE) and likelihood-based lensing\\nestimators. We show that for Simons-Observatory-like surveys, this mean-field\\nbias can reach 15% in cross-correlation with large-scale structures if\\nunaccounted for. We further demonstrate that this delensed noise mean-field can\\nbe safely neglected in likelihood-based estimators without compromising the\\nquality of lensing reconstruction or $B$-mode delensing, provided the resulting\\nlensing map is properly renormalized.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T16:35:34Z\"}"}
