{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00578v1\", \"title\": \"AI-Driven High-Resolution Cell Segmentation and Quantitative Analysis\", \"summary\": \"Studying the growth and metabolism of microbes provides critical insights\\ninto their evolutionary adaptations to harsh environments, which are essential\\nfor microbial research and biotechnology applications. In this study, we\\ndeveloped an AI-driven image analysis system to efficiently segment individual\\ncells and quantitatively analyze key cellular features. This system is\\ncomprised of four main modules. First, a denoising algorithm enhances contrast\\nand suppresses noise while preserving fine cellular details. Second, the\\nSegment Anything Model (SAM) enables accurate, zero-shot segmentation of cells\\nwithout additional training. Third, post-processing is applied to refine\\nsegmentation results by removing over-segmented masks. Finally, quantitative\\nanalysis algorithms extract essential cellular features, including average\\nintensity, length, width, and volume. The results show that denoising and\\npost-processing significantly improved the segmentation accuracy of SAM in this\\nnew domain. Without human annotations, the AI-driven pipeline automatically and\\nefficiently outlines cellular boundaries, indexes them, and calculates key\\ncellular parameters with high accuracy. This framework will enable efficient\\nand automated quantitative analysis of high-resolution fluorescence microscopy\\nimages to advance research into microbial adaptations to grow and metabolism\\nthat allow extremophiles to thrive in their harsh habitats.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,q-bio.QM\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T15:09:03Z\"}"}
