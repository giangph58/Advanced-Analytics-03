{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01497v1\", \"title\": \"Acceleration via Perturbations on Low-resolution Ordinary Differential\\n  Equations\", \"summary\": \"Recently, the high-resolution ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework,\\nwhich retains higher-order terms, has been proposed to analyze gradient-based\\noptimization algorithms. Through this framework, the term $\\\\nabla^2\\nf(X_t)\\\\dot{X_t}$, known as the gradient-correction term, was found to be\\nessential for reducing oscillations and accelerating the convergence rate of\\nfunction values. Despite the importance of this term, simply adding it to the\\nlow-resolution ODE may sometimes lead to a slower convergence rate. To fully\\nunderstand this phenomenon, we propose a generalized perturbed ODE and analyze\\nthe role of the gradient and gradient-correction perturbation terms under both\\ncontinuous-time and discrete-time settings. We demonstrate that while the\\ngradient-correction perturbation is essential for obtaining accelerations, it\\ncan hinder the convergence rate of function values in certain cases. However,\\nthis adverse effect can be mitigated by involving an additional gradient\\nperturbation term. Moreover, by conducting a comprehensive analysis, we derive\\nproper choices of perturbation parameters. Numerical experiments are also\\nprovided to validate our theoretical findings.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:50:31Z\"}"}
