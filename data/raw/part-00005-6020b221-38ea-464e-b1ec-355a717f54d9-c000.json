{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04181v1\", \"title\": \"Privacy Challenges In Image Processing Applications\", \"summary\": \"As image processing systems proliferate, privacy concerns intensify given the\\nsensitive personal information contained in images. This paper examines privacy\\nchallenges in image processing and surveys emerging privacy-preserving\\ntechniques including differential privacy, secure multiparty computation,\\nhomomorphic encryption, and anonymization. Key applications with heightened\\nprivacy risks include healthcare, where medical images contain patient health\\ndata, and surveillance systems that can enable unwarranted tracking.\\nDifferential privacy offers rigorous privacy guarantees by injecting controlled\\nnoise, while MPC facilitates collaborative analytics without exposing raw data\\ninputs. Homomorphic encryption enables computations on encrypted data and\\nanonymization directly removes identifying elements. However, balancing privacy\\nprotections and utility remains an open challenge. Promising future directions\\nidentified include quantum-resilient cryptography, federated learning,\\ndedicated hardware, and conceptual innovations like privacy by design.\\nUltimately, a holistic effort combining technological innovations, ethical\\nconsiderations, and policy frameworks is necessary to uphold the fundamental\\nright to privacy as image processing capabilities continue advancing rapidly.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T07:28:03Z\"}"}
