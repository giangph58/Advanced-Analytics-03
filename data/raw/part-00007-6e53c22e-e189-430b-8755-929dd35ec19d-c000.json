The mapping approach to surface hopping (MASH) is compared with\\nstandard fewest-switches surface hopping on three model systems, for which the\\nfull quantum-mechanical results are available. Electronic populations and\\ncoherences in the adiabatic representation as well as nuclear densities are\\ncomputed to assess the robustness of the different methods. The results show\\nthat standard surface hopping can fail to describe the electronic coherences,\\nwhereas they are accurately captured by MASH for the same computational cost.\\nIn this way, MASH appears to be an excellent simulation approach for novel\\nX-ray spectroscopies such as the recently proposed Transient Redistribution of\\nUltrafast Electronic Coherences in Attosecond Raman Signals (TRUECARS).\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T16:45:03Z\"}"}
