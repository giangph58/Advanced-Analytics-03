{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00452v1\", \"title\": \"ClearLines - Camera Calibration from Straight Lines\", \"summary\": \"The problem of calibration from straight lines is fundamental in geometric\\ncomputer vision, with well-established theoretical foundations. However, its\\npractical applicability remains limited, particularly in real-world outdoor\\nscenarios. These environments pose significant challenges due to diverse and\\ncluttered scenes, interrupted reprojections of straight 3D lines, and varying\\nlighting conditions, making the task notoriously difficult. Furthermore, the\\nfield lacks a dedicated dataset encouraging the development of respective\\ndetection algorithms. In this study, we present a small dataset named\\n\\\"ClearLines\\\", and by detailing its creation process, provide practical insights\\nthat can serve as a guide for developing and refining straight 3D line\\ndetection algorithms.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T10:55:36Z\"}"}
