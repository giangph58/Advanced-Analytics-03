{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19606v1\", \"title\": \"Coreference Resolution for Vietnamese Narrative Texts\", \"summary\": \"Coreference resolution is a vital task in natural language processing (NLP)\\nthat involves identifying and linking different expressions in a text that\\nrefer to the same entity. This task is particularly challenging for Vietnamese,\\na low-resource language with limited annotated datasets. To address these\\nchallenges, we developed a comprehensive annotated dataset using narrative\\ntexts from VnExpress, a widely-read Vietnamese online news platform. We\\nestablished detailed guidelines for annotating entities, focusing on ensuring\\nconsistency and accuracy. Additionally, we evaluated the performance of large\\nlanguage models (LLMs), specifically GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4, on this dataset.\\nOur results demonstrate that GPT-4 significantly outperforms GPT-3.5-Turbo in\\nterms of both accuracy and response consistency, making it a more reliable tool\\nfor coreference resolution in Vietnamese.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T09:10:41Z\"}"}
