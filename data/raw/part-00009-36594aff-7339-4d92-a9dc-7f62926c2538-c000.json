This completely eliminates the dependency on Selberg's\\neigenvalue conjecture in previous works of Lichtman and the author, which built\\nin turn on results of Maynard and Drappeau. We rely on recent large sieve\\ninequalities for exceptional Maass forms of the author for\\nadditively-structured sequences, and on a related result of Watt for\\nmultiplicatively-structured sequences. As applications, we prove refined upper\\nbounds for the counts of twin primes and consecutive smooth numbers up to $x$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T16:55:08Z\"}"}
