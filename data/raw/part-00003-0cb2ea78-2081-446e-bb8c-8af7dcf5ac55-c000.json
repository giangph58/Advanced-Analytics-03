The correct MP or AMF\\ncontribution to the electronic energy is elucidated. The performance of\\none-center approximations to relativistic two-electron contributions is\\ncarefully assessed using benchmark calculations of molecular properties.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T04:35:04Z\"}"}
