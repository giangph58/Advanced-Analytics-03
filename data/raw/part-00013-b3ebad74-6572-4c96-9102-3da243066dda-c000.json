{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01546v1\", \"title\": \"From indirect to direct taxis by fast reaction limit\", \"summary\": \"Many ecological population models consider taxis as the directed movement of\\nanimals in response to a stimulus. The taxis is named direct if the animals are\\nguided by the density gradient of some other population or indirect if they are\\nguided by the density of a chemical secreted by individuals of the other\\npopulation. Let $u$ and $v$ denote the densities of two populations and $w$ the\\ndensity of the chemical secreted by individuals in the $v$ population. We\\nconsider a bounded, open set $\\\\Omega \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^N$ with regular\\nboundary and prove that for the space dimension $N\\\\leq 2$ the solution to the\\nLotka-Volterra competition model with repulsive indirect taxis and homogeneous\\nNeumann boundary conditions\\n  $$u_t - d_u\\\\Delta u = \\\\chi \\\\nabla \\\\cdot u \\\\nabla w +\\\\mu_1u(1-u-a_1v)\\\\,,$$\\n  $$ v_t - d_v\\\\Delta v = \\\\mu_2v(1-v-a_2u)\\\\,,$$\\n  $$\\\\varepsilon ( w_t - d_w\\\\Delta w )= v- w\\\\, , $$ converges to the solution of\\nrepulsive direct-taxis model: $$ u_t - d_u\\\\Delta u = \\\\chi \\\\nabla \\\\cdot u \\\\nabla\\nv +\\\\mu_1u(1-u-a_1v)\\\\,,$$ $$ v_t - d_v\\\\Delta v = \\\\mu_2v(1-v-a_2u)\\\\,$$ when\\n$\\\\varepsilon\\\\longrightarrow 0$. For space dimension $N\\\\geq 3$ we use the\\ncompactness argument to show that the result holds in some weak sense. A\\nsimilar result is also proved for a typical prey-predator model with prey taxis\\nand logistic growth of predators.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T09:40:34Z\"}"}
