By mapping quantum states to classical data points through strategic\\nobservable measurements, we create a \\\"quantum state cloud\\\" analyzable via\\npersistent homology techniques. Our framework establishes that quantum systems\\nin the same topological phase exhibit consistent barcode representations with\\nshared persistent homology groups over characteristic intervals. We prove that\\nquantum phase transitions manifest as significant changes in these persistent\\nhomology features, detectable through discontinuities in the persistent Dirac\\noperator spectrum. Using the SSH model as a demonstrative example, we show how\\nour approach successfully identifies the topological phase transition and\\ndistinguishes between trivial and topological phases. While primarily developed\\nfor symmetry-protected topological phases, our framework provides a\\nmathematical connection between persistent homology and quantum topology,\\noffering new methods for phase classification that complement traditional\\ninvariant-based approaches.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,math-ph,math.AT,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:53:21Z\"}"}
