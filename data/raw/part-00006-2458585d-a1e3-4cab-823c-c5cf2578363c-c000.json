The nuclear $\\\\alpha$ decay is one of the earliest observed evidences of\\nclustering in quantum systems, yet its formation process remains poorly\\nunderstood even today. In this letter, we propose a novel global odd-even\\nstaggering (OES) feature in $\\\\alpha$ decay, which emerges during the clustering\\nprocess. To unveil its origin, we develop a Universal Four-Fermion Formation\\nFramework (U4F), which describes the formation of any four-nucleon cluster,\\nsuch as $\\\\alpha$ particle, from a general microscopic wave function, without\\nassuming the preexistence of clustering or pairing. By combining U4F with the\\nlarge-scale configuration-interaction approach, we demonstrate that the OES\\neffect in $\\\\alpha$ decay arises from the suppression of clustering correlations\\ndue to unpaired nucleons. These findings significantly advance our\\nunderstanding of cluster formation in nuclei and have important implications\\nfor the production of new elements and nuclear synthesis in the universe.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T05:20:53Z\"}"}
