A\\nmonostatic integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system is developed\\nand, it is demonstrated that by leveraging the cyclic shift property inherent\\nin the RCP, a delay-Doppler (DD) channel matrix that encapsulates the effects\\nof propagation delays and Doppler shifts through unitary matrices can be\\nderived. Consequently, a novel low-complexity correlation-based algorithm\\nperforming disjoint delay-Doppler estimation is proposed for channel\\nestimation. Subsequently, this estimation approach is adapted to perform radar\\nsensing on backscattered data frames. Moreover, channel estimation is\\ncomplemented by a deep learning (DL) architecture that improves path detection\\nand accuracy under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, compared to\\nstopping criterion (SC) based multipath detection. Simulation results indicate\\nthat the proposed estimation scheme achieves lower normalized mean squared\\nerror (NMSE) compared to conventional channel estimation algorithms and sensing\\nperformance close to the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Furthermore, an\\niterative data detection algorithm based on matched filter (MF) and combining\\nis developed by exploiting the unitary property of delay-Doppler parameterized\\nmatrices. Simulation results reveal that this iterative scheme achieves\\nperformance comparable to that of the linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE)\\nestimator while significantly reducing computational complexity.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T11:34:47Z\"}"}
