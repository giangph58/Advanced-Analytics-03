{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20458v1\", \"title\": \"Search-Based Interaction For Conversation Recommendation via Generative\\n  Reward Model Based Simulated User\", \"summary\": \"Conversational recommendation systems (CRSs) use multi-turn interaction to\\ncapture user preferences and provide personalized recommendations. A\\nfundamental challenge in CRSs lies in effectively understanding user\\npreferences from conversations. User preferences can be multifaceted and\\ncomplex, posing significant challenges for accurate recommendations even with\\naccess to abundant external knowledge. While interaction with users can clarify\\ntheir true preferences, frequent user involvement can lead to a degraded user\\nexperience.\\n  To address this problem, we propose a generative reward model based simulated\\nuser, named GRSU, for automatic interaction with CRSs. The simulated user\\nprovides feedback to the items recommended by CRSs, enabling them to better\\ncapture intricate user preferences through multi-turn interaction. Inspired by\\ngenerative reward models, we design two types of feedback actions for the\\nsimulated user: i.e., generative item scoring, which offers coarse-grained\\nfeedback, and attribute-based item critique, which provides fine-grained\\nfeedback. To ensure seamless integration, these feedback actions are unified\\ninto an instruction-based format, allowing the development of a unified\\nsimulated user via instruction tuning on synthesized data. With this simulated\\nuser, automatic multi-turn interaction with CRSs can be effectively conducted.\\nFurthermore, to strike a balance between effectiveness and efficiency, we draw\\ninspiration from the paradigm of reward-guided search in complex reasoning\\ntasks and employ beam search for the interaction process. On top of this, we\\npropose an efficient candidate ranking method to improve the recommendation\\nresults derived from interaction. Extensive experiments on public datasets\\ndemonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and transferability of our approach.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR,cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T06:37:30Z\"}"}
