{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00516v1\", \"title\": \"First Measurement of the Electron Neutrino Charged-Current Pion\\n  Production Cross Section on Carbon with the T2K Near Detector\", \"summary\": \"The T2K Collaboration presents the first measurement of electron\\nneutrino-induced charged-current pion production on carbon in a restricted\\nkinematical phase space. This is performed using data from the 2.5$^{\\\\deg}$\\noff-axis near detector, ND280. The differential cross sections with respect to\\nthe outgoing electron and pion kinematics, in addition to the total\\nflux-integrated cross section, are obtained. Comparisons between the measured\\nand predicted cross section results using the Neut, Genie and NuWro Monte Carlo\\nevent generators are presented. The measured total flux-integrated cross\\nsection is [2.52 $\\\\pm$ 0.52 (stat) $\\\\pm$ 0.30 (sys)] x $10^{-39}$ cm$^2$\\nnucleon$^{-1}$, which is lower than the event generator predictions.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T13:35:18Z\"}"}
