We\\nshow that this version is consistent with the geometry of the sample space\\n${\\\\Bbb R}^n$. In particular, we can evaluate the WKL-divergence of the Dirac\\nmeasures concentrated in two points which turns out to be proportional to the\\nsquared distance between these points.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.ML,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T12:49:01Z\"}"}
