{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17555v1\", \"title\": \"Coexistence of mixing and rigid behaviors in ergodic theory\", \"summary\": \"In this paper we introduce and explore the notion of rigidity group,\\nassociated with a collection of finitely many sequences, and show that this\\nconcept has many, somewhat surprising characterizations of algebraic, spectral,\\nand unitary nature. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these characterizations\\ncan be employed to obtain various results in the theory of generic\\nLebesgue-preserving automorphisms of $[0,1]$, IP-ergodic theory, multiple\\nrecurrence, additive combinatorics, and spectral theory. As a consequence of\\none of our results we show that given $(b_1,...b_\\\\ell)\\\\in\\\\mathbb N^\\\\ell$, there\\nis no orthogonal vector $(a_1,\\\\dots,a_\\\\ell)\\\\in\\\\mathbb Z^\\\\ell$ with some\\n$|a_j|=1$ if and only if there is an increasing sequence of natural numbers\\n$(n_k)_{k\\\\in\\\\mathbb N}$ with the property that for each $F\\\\subseteq\\n\\\\{1,...,\\\\ell\\\\}$ there is a $\\\\mu$-preserving transformation\\n$T_F:[0,1]\\\\rightarrow[0,1]$ ($\\\\mu$ denotes the Lebesgue measure) such that for\\nany measurable $A,B\\\\subseteq [0,1]$, $$\\\\lim_{k\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty}\\\\mu(A\\\\cap\\nT_F^{-b_jn_k}B)=\\\\begin{cases} \\\\mu(A\\\\cap B),\\\\,\\\\text{ if }j\\\\in F,\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\mu(A)\\\\mu(B),\\\\,\\\\text{ if }j\\\\not\\\\in F. \\\\end{cases}$$ We remark that this result\\nhas a natural extension to a wide class of families of sequences.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T13:49:46Z\"}"}
