The\\npresent paper describes key issues that could be addressed in a Suitably\\nEnhanced DT-capable Tokamak (SET), with tungsten plasma facing components,\\nboronization systems, and 10 MW of ECRH, based on characteristics and\\nknowledgebase of JET. We discuss hardware options, and show that\\nfusion-relevant operational scenarios could be achieved. Notably, development,\\nvalidation and testing of fusion and nuclear diagnostics, to be used in next\\ngeneration devices, would require a D-T capable tokamak as described.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph,nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:24:11Z\"}"}
