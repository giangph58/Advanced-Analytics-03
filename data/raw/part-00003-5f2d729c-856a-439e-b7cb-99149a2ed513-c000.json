{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06632v1\", \"title\": \"PosterMaker: Towards High-Quality Product Poster Generation with\\n  Accurate Text Rendering\", \"summary\": \"Product posters, which integrate subject, scene, and text, are crucial\\npromotional tools for attracting customers. Creating such posters using modern\\nimage generation methods is valuable, while the main challenge lies in\\naccurately rendering text, especially for complex writing systems like Chinese,\\nwhich contains over 10,000 individual characters. In this work, we identify the\\nkey to precise text rendering as constructing a character-discriminative visual\\nfeature as a control signal. Based on this insight, we propose a robust\\ncharacter-wise representation as control and we develop TextRenderNet, which\\nachieves a high text rendering accuracy of over 90%. Another challenge in\\nposter generation is maintaining the fidelity of user-specific products. We\\naddress this by introducing SceneGenNet, an inpainting-based model, and propose\\nsubject fidelity feedback learning to further enhance fidelity. Based on\\nTextRenderNet and SceneGenNet, we present PosterMaker, an end-to-end generation\\nframework. To optimize PosterMaker efficiently, we implement a two-stage\\ntraining strategy that decouples text rendering and background generation\\nlearning. Experimental results show that PosterMaker outperforms existing\\nbaselines by a remarkable margin, which demonstrates its effectiveness.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T07:13:08Z\"}"}
