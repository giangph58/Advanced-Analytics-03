Inspired by their work,\\nwe provide several characterizations of systems that are disjoint from all\\nminimal systems.\\n  For a topological dynamical system $(X,T)$, it is disjoint from all minimal\\nsystems if and only if there exist minimal subsets $(M_i)_{i\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}}$ of\\n$X$ whose union is dense in $X$ and each of them is disjoint from $X$ (we also\\nprovide a measure-theoretical analogy of the result). For a semi-simple system\\n$(X,T)$, it is disjoint from all minimal systems if and only if there exists a\\ndense $G_{\\\\delta}$ set $\\\\Omega$ in $X \\\\times X$ such that for every pair\\n$(x_1,x_2) \\\\in \\\\Omega$, the subsystems $\\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{O}}(x_1,T)$ and\\n$\\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{O}}(x_2,T)$ are disjoint. Furthermore, for a general system\\na characterization similar to the ergodic case is obtained.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T12:48:40Z\"}"}
