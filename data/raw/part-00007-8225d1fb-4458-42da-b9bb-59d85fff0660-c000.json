In this work, we investigate the superconducting state of\\nPdTe using point-contact Andreev reflection (PCAR) spectroscopy. The\\nexperimental data are analyzed using the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (BTK) model\\nfor s, p and d wave symmetries. Our results reveal clear evidence of\\nunconventional superconductivity. The superconducting gap showing features\\nconsistent with either p-wave or d-wave pairing symmetries but cannot be fitted\\nwith s-wave symmetry. The observed anisotropic gap structure and deviations\\nfrom conventional BCS behaviour highlight the complex nature of the pairing\\ninteractions in PdTe. These findings provide strong evidence of unconventional\\npairing symmetry in this material.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:14:00Z\"}"}
