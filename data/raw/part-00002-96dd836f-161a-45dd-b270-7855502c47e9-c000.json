Over the years, the resolution of SAR images has been\\nsteadily improving and the pixel count increasing as a result of advances in\\nthe sensor technology, and so have the computational resources required to\\nprocess the raw data to a focused image. Because they are a necessary step in\\nthe study of the retrieved data, new high-resolution and low-complexity\\nfocusing algorithms are constantly explored in the SAR literature. The theory\\nof quantum computing proposes a new computational framework that might allow to\\nprocess a vast amount of data in a more efficient way. Relevant to our case is\\nthe advantage proven for the quantum Fourier transform (QFT), the quantum\\ncounterpart of a fundamental element of many SAR focusing algorithms. Motivated\\nby this, in this work we propose a quantum version of the range-Doppler\\nalgorithm. We show how in general reference functions, a key element in many\\nSAR focusing algorithms, can be mapped to quantum gates; we present the quantum\\ncircuit performing the SAR raw data focusing and we discuss in detail its\\ncomputational complexity. We find that the core of the quantum range-Doppler\\nalgorithm has a computational complexity, namely the number of single- and\\ntwo-qubit gates, of $O(N)$, less than its classical counterpart with\\ncomputational complexity $O(N \\\\log N)$.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:24:23Z\"}"}
