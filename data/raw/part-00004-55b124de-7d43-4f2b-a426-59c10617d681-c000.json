These solutions compute\\nstatistical averages of an ensemble of boundary conformal field theories\\n(BCFTs) related to universal asymptotics of OPE data extracted from 2D\\nconformal bootstrap. Conical defects connect BCFT bulk operators; branes join\\nBCFT boundary intervals with identical boundary conditions; kinks (1D defects\\nalong branes) link BCFT boundary operators; and punctures (0D defects) are\\nendpoints where conical defects terminate on branes. We provide evidence for a\\ncorrespondence between the gravity theory and the ensemble. In particular, the\\nagreement of $g$-function dependence results from an underlying topological\\naspect of the on-shell EOW brane action, from which a BCFT analogue of the\\nSchlenker-Witten theorem also follows.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T17:38:27Z\"}"}
