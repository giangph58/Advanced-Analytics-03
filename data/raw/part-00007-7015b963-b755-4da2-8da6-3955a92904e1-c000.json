Peekaboo, a Dynamic Binary\\nInstrumentation (DBI) tool, defeats malware evasion techniques to capture\\nauthentic behavior at the Assembly (ASM) instruction level. This behavior\\nexhibits patterns consistent with Zipf's law, a distribution commonly seen in\\nnatural languages, making Transformer models particularly effective for binary\\nclassification tasks. We introduce Alpha, a framework for zero day malware\\ndetection that leverages Transformer models and ASM language. Alpha is trained\\non malware and benign software data collected through Peekaboo, enabling it to\\nidentify entirely new samples with exceptional accuracy. Alpha eliminates any\\ncommon functions from the test samples that are in the training dataset. This\\nforces the model to rely on contextual patterns and novel ASM instruction\\ncombinations to detect malicious behavior, rather than memorizing familiar\\nfeatures. By combining the strengths of DBI, ASM analysis, and Transformer\\narchitectures, Alpha offers a powerful approach to proactively addressing the\\nevolving threat of malware. Alpha demonstrates perfect accuracy for Ransomware,\\nWorms and APTs with flawless classification for both malicious and benign\\nsamples. The results highlight the model's exceptional performance in detecting\\ntruly new malware samples.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T06:30:21Z\"}"}
