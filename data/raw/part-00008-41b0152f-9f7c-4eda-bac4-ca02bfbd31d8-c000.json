{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16060v1\", \"title\": \"Vision-Language Models Are Not Pragmatically Competent in Referring\\n  Expression Generation\", \"summary\": \"Referring Expression Generation (REG) is a core task for evaluating the\\npragmatic competence of vision-language systems, requiring not only accurate\\nsemantic grounding but also adherence to principles of cooperative\\ncommunication (Grice, 1975). However, current evaluations of vision-language\\nmodels (VLMs) often overlook the pragmatic dimension, reducing REG to a\\nregion-based captioning task and neglecting Gricean maxims. In this work, we\\nrevisit REG from a pragmatic perspective, introducing a new dataset (RefOI) of\\n1.5k images annotated with both written and spoken referring expressions.\\nThrough a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs, we identify three key\\nfailures of pragmatic competence: (1) failure to uniquely identify the\\nreferent, (2) inclusion of excessive or irrelevant information, and (3)\\nmisalignment with human pragmatic preference, such as the underuse of minimal\\nspatial cues. We also show that standard automatic evaluations fail to capture\\nthese pragmatic violations, reinforcing superficial cues rather than genuine\\nreferential success. Our findings call for a renewed focus on pragmatically\\ninformed models and evaluation frameworks that align with real human\\ncommunication.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T17:37:16Z\"}"}
