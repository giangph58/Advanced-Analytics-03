Combining with previous cases\\nof Kazhdan-Lusztig, Kriloff, Kriloff-Ram, Opdam-Solleveld, Ciubotaru-Opdam,\\nthis completes the classification of discrete series for all the graded Hecke\\nalgebras of positive parameters. Main tools include construction of calibrated\\nmodules and construction of certain minimally induced modules for discrete\\nseries. We also study the anti-sphericiity and Ext-branching laws for some\\ndiscrete series.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RT\", \"categories\": \"math.RT,math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T16:50:01Z\"}"}
