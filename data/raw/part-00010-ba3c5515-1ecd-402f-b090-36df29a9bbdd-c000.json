{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13114v1\", \"title\": \"Supersymmetric Poisson and Poisson-supersymmetric sigma models\", \"summary\": \"We revisit and construct new examples of supersymmetric 2D topological sigma\\nmodels whose target space is a Poisson supermanifold. Inspired by the AKSZ\\nconstruction of topological field theories, we follow a graded-geometric\\napproach and identify two commuting homological vector fields compatible with\\nthe graded symplectic structure, which control the gauge symmetries and the\\nsupersymmetries of the sigma models. Exemplifying the general structure, we\\nshow that two distinguished cases exist, one being the differential Poisson\\nsigma model constructed before by Arias, Boulanger, Sundell and Torres-Gomez\\nand the other a contravariant differential Poisson sigma model. The new model\\nfeatures nonlinear supersymmetry transformations that are generated by the\\nPoisson structure on the body of the target supermanifold, giving rise to a\\nPoisson supersymmetry. Further examples are characterised by supersymmetry\\ntransformations controlled by the anchor map of a Lie algebroid, when this map\\nis invertible, in which case we determine the geometric conditions for\\ninvariance under supersymmetry and closure of the supersymmetry algebra.\\nMoreover, we show that the common thread through this type of models is that\\ntheir supersymmetry-generating vector field is the coadjoint representation up\\nto homotopy of a Lie algebroid.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:29:22Z\"}"}
