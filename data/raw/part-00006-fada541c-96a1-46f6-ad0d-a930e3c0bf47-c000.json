{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05198v1\", \"title\": \"Bayesian estimation of causal effects from observational categorical\\n  data\", \"summary\": \"We present a Bayesian procedure for estimation of pairwise intervention\\neffects in a high-dimensional system of categorical variables. We assume that\\nwe have observational data generated from an unknown causal Bayesian network\\nfor which there are no latent confounders. Most of the existing methods\\ndeveloped for this setting assume that the underlying model is linear Gaussian,\\nincluding the Bayesian IDA (BIDA) method that we build upon in this work. By\\ncombining a Bayesian backdoor estimator with model averaging, we obtain a\\nposterior over the intervention distributions of a cause-effect pair that can\\nbe expressed as a mixture over stochastic linear combinations of Dirichlet\\ndistributions. Although there is no closed-form expression for the posterior\\ndensity, it is straightforward to produce Monte Carlo approximations of target\\nquantities through direct sampling, and we also derive closed-form expressions\\nfor a few selected moments. To scale up the proposed procedure, we employ\\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which also enables us to use more efficient\\nadjustment sets compared to the current exact BIDA. Finally, we use\\nJensen-Shannon divergence to define a novel causal effect based on a set of\\nintervention distributions in the general categorical setting. We compare our\\nmethod to the original IDA method and existing Bayesian approaches in numerical\\nsimulations and show that categorical BIDA performs favorably against the\\nexisting alternative methods in terms of producing point estimates and\\ndiscovering strong effects.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T15:49:36Z\"}"}
