Some are suitable for high\\nschool; others could generate college-level projects involving computer\\nalgebra. The problems are functional equations with group actions in the\\nbackground. Interesting examples arise even from small finite groups. Whether a\\ngiven problem ``works\\\" with a given choice of constant coefficients depends on\\nwhether a related multilinear form is nonzero. These forms are essentially the\\nclassical group determinants studied by Frobenius in the nineteenth century.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GR\", \"categories\": \"math.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T10:53:52Z\"}"}
