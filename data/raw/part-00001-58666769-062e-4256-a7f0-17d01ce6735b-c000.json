Their generation has been\\nrecently demonstrated using semiconductor quantum dots emitting at the 900 nm\\nwavelength range. However, a similar demonstration at the communication-optimal\\ntelecom range has remained elusive. A key ingredient that is still missing is\\nan appropriate optical excitation method. A central requirement of such a\\nmethod is to allow an arbitrary spin initialization of quantum dot excitonic\\ncomplexes. In this work, we report on developing such a method based on a\\nquasi-resonant p-shell excitation for a telecom-C-band-emitting quantum dot. We\\nshow qubit writing of a neutral exciton and spin-preserving excitation of a\\nnegative trion. Using the Larmor precession of the negative trion under an\\nexternally applied magnetic field, we determine the in-plane g-factors of both\\nthe electron and the hole in the investigated quantum dot. In addition, we\\nmeasure a lower bound on the hole coherence time, $T_{2}^{*}>6.4$ ns, boosting\\nits candidacy as a sound photon entangler for more advanced quantum photonic\\nschemes.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T07:38:17Z\"}"}
