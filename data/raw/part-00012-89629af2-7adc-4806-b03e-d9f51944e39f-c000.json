In\\nthis work, we recast forward model validation as an out-of-distribution (OoD)\\ndetection problem within the framework of machine learning (ML)-based\\nsimulation-based inference (SBI). We employ probability density as the metric\\nfor OoD detection, and compare various density estimation techniques,\\ndemonstrating that field-level probability density estimation via continuous\\ntime flow models (CTFM) significantly outperforms feature-level approaches that\\ncombine scattering transform (ST) or convolutional neural networks (CNN) with\\nnormalizing flows (NFs), as well as NF-based field-level estimators, as\\nquantified by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve\\n(AUROC). Our analysis shows that CTFM not only excels in detecting OoD samples\\nbut also provides a robust metric for model selection. Additionally, we\\nverified CTFM maintains consistent efficacy across different cosmologies while\\nmitigating the inductive biases inherent in NF architectures. Although our\\nproof-of-concept study employs simplified forward modeling and noise settings,\\nour framework establishes a promising pathway for identifying unknown\\nsystematics in the cosmology datasets.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T16:16:47Z\"}"}
