{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03616v1\", \"title\": \"A Systematic Search for X-ray Eclipse Events in Active Galactic Nuclei\\n  Observed by Swift\", \"summary\": \"The nuclear regions of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) likely host clumpy\\nclouds that occasionally obscure the central X-ray source, causing eclipse\\nevents. These events offer a unique opportunity to study the properties and\\norigins of such clouds. However, these transient events are rarely reported due\\nto the need for extensive, long-term X-ray monitoring for years. Here, we\\nconduct a systematic search for eclipse events in 40 AGNs well-monitored by the\\nSwift X-ray Telescope (XRT) over the past 20 years, comprising a total of\\n$\\\\sim$11,000 observations. Our selection criteria rely on significant\\nvariations in X-ray flux and spectral shape. We identify 3 high-confidence\\nevents in 3 AGNs and 8 candidates in 6 AGNs, all in type I AGNs. The observed\\nclouds have column densities of $N_{\\\\rm H}~\\\\sim$ (0.2 $-$ 31.2) $\\\\times$\\n10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ and ionization degrees of log $\\\\xi$ $\\\\sim$ (-1.3 $-$ 2.2).\\nFor the 5 events with well-constrained duration, their distances from the\\ncentral black hole range from (2.4 $-$ 179) $\\\\times$ 10$^{4}$ $R_{\\\\rm g}$, with\\n2 clouds near the dust sublimation zone, 2 farther out. Interestingly, we find\\ntentative correlations between the cloud properties (i.e. ionization state and\\ncolumn density) and the black hole mass and mass accretion rate, implying their\\nstrong connection to the accretion process, potentially via outflows. Our study\\nalso demonstrates the potential of the new X-ray all-sky monitor, Einstein\\nProbe, in providing more detection and physical constraints for such events.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:15:56Z\"}"}
