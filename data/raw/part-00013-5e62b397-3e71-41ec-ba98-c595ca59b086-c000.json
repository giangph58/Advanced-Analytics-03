When exposed to the steady vortex structures of acoustic\\nstreaming flow, these microorganisms exhibit intriguing dynamic behaviors, such\\nas hydrodynamic trapping and aggregation. To uncover the mechanisms behind\\nthese behaviors, we investigate the swimming dynamics of both passive and\\nactive particles within a two-dimensional acoustic streaming flow. By employing\\na theoretically calculated streaming flow field, we demonstrate the existence\\nof stable bounded orbits for particles. Additionally, we introduce rotational\\ndiffusion and examine the distribution of particles under varying flow\\nstrengths. Our findings reveal that active particles can laterally migrate\\nacross streamlines and become trapped in stable bounded orbits closer to the\\nvortex center, whereas passive particles are confined to movement along the\\nstreamlines. We emphasize the influence of the flow field on the distribution\\nand trapping of active particles, identifying a flow configuration that\\nmaximizes their aggregation. These insights contribute to the manipulation of\\nmicroswimmers and the development of innovative biological microfluidic chips.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T08:53:08Z\"}"}
