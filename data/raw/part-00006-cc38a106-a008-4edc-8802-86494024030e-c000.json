{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15792v1\", \"title\": \"Development and evaluation of a deep learning algorithm for German word\\n  recognition from lip movements\", \"summary\": \"When reading lips, many people benefit from additional visual information\\nfrom the lip movements of the speaker, which is, however, very error prone.\\nAlgorithms for lip reading with artificial intelligence based on artificial\\nneural networks significantly improve word recognition but are not available\\nfor the German language. A total of 1806 video clips with only one\\nGerman-speaking person each were selected, split into word segments, and\\nassigned to word classes using speech-recognition software. In 38,391 video\\nsegments with 32 speakers, 18 polysyllabic, visually distinguishable words were\\nused to train and validate a neural network. The 3D Convolutional Neural\\nNetwork and Gated Recurrent Units models and a combination of both models\\n(GRUConv) were compared, as were different image sections and color spaces of\\nthe videos. The accuracy was determined in 5000 training epochs. Comparison of\\nthe color spaces did not reveal any relevant different correct classification\\nrates in the range from 69% to 72%. With a cut to the lips, a significantly\\nhigher accuracy of 70% was achieved than when cut to the entire speaker's face\\n(34%). With the GRUConv model, the maximum accuracies were 87% with known\\nspeakers and 63% in the validation with unknown speakers. The neural network\\nfor lip reading, which was first developed for the German language, shows a\\nvery high level of accuracy, comparable to English-language algorithms. It\\nworks with unknown speakers as well and can be generalized with more word\\nclasses.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T11:12:00Z\"}"}
