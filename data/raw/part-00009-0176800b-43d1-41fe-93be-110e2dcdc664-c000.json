{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20640v1\", \"title\": \"Sharpening Vahlen's result in Diophantine approximation\", \"summary\": \"n this paper we refine Vahlen's 1895 result in Diophantine approximation by\\nproviding sharper bounds for the approximation coefficients, especially when at\\nleast one of the partial quotients $a_n$ or $a_{n+1}$ of the regular continued\\nfraction expansion $[a_0;a_1,a_2,\\\\dots]$ of $x$ is 1. An improvement of\\nVahlen's result was already given in papers by Jaroslav Han\\\\u{c}l ([9]),\\nHan\\\\u{c}l and Silvie Bahnerova ([10]), and by Dinesh Sharma Bhattarai ([5]),\\nbut the approach of the present paper is very different from Han\\\\u{c}l c.s. We\\nbelieve that the geometrical methods used in this paper not only offer a\\nsignificant improvement over Vahlen's result, but also yield new insights that\\ncan contribute to improving Borel's classical constant.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS,math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T11:11:36Z\"}"}
