We\\nstarting with an overview of the key physical characteristics of lipid\\nbilayers, including their composition, mechanical properties, and\\nthermodynamics, and then discuss continuum models of multi-component bilayers.\\nThe most complex model is a Navier--Stokes--Cahn--Hilliard (NSCH) type system,\\ndescribing the coupling of incompressible surface fluid dynamics with\\nphase-field dynamics on arbitrarily curved geometries. It is discretized using\\ntrace finite element methods, which offer geometric flexibility and stability\\nin representing surface PDEs. Numerical studies are conducted to examine\\nphysical features such as coarsening rates and interfacial dynamics. The\\ncomputational results obtained from the NSCH model are compared against\\nexperimental data for membrane compositions with distinct phase behaviors,\\ndemonstrating that including both phase-field models and surface hydrodynamics\\nis essential to accurately reproduce domain evolution observed in\\nepi-fluorescence microscopy. Lastly, we extend the model to incorporate\\nexternal forces that enable the simulation of vesicles containing cationic\\nlipids, used to enhance membrane fusion.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T16:17:39Z\"}"}
