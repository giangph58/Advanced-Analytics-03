We argue that this statement has the same\\nconceptual structure as the hole argument, and is thus likewise defused by the\\npoint-coincidence argument: We show that the boundary problem dissolves once it\\nis understood that a physical region, thus its boundary, is relationally and\\ninvariantly defined. This insight can be technically implemented via the\\nDressing Field Method, a systematic tool to exhibit the gauge-invariant content\\nof general-relativistic gauge field theories, whereby physical\\nfield-theoretical degrees of freedoms co-define each other and define,\\ncoordinatize, the physical spacetime. We illustrate our claim with a simple\\napplication to the case of General Relativity.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:12:19Z\"}"}
