Here, we show that $d$-wave altermagnets, a\\nrecently discovered class of collinear magnetism, naturally realize a spin\\ndemon, which consists of out-of-phase movement of the two spin species. The\\nspin demon lives outside of the particle-hole continuum of one of the spin\\nspecies, and is therefore significantly underdamped, reaching quality factors\\nof $>10$. We show that the spin demon carries a magnetic moment, which inherits\\nthe $d$-wave symmetry. Finally, we consider both three and two dimensional\\n$d$-wave altermagnets, and show that spin demons exists in both.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T10:51:29Z\"}"}
