We give an explicit formula for this polynomial,\\nanalogous to the formulas of Khovanskii-Pukhlikov for the Ehrhart polynomial.\\nThese counting polynomials satisfy a lacunarity principle, the vanishing of\\nalternate coefficients, quite unlike the Ehrhart polynomial. We show that\\nformal geometric quantization of singular Calabi Yau hypersurfaces in smooth\\ntoric varieties gives this polynomial, in analogy with the relation of the\\nKhovanskii-Pukhlikov formula to the geometric quantization of toric varieties.\\nThe Atiyah-Singer theorem for the index of the Dirac operator gives a moral\\nargument for the lacunarity of the counting polynomial. We conjecture that\\nsimilar formulas should hold for arbitrary simple integral polytope boundaries.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,hep-th,math.AG,math.SG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T13:19:30Z\"}"}
