They are poorly understood and suffer\\nfrom strong biases inherited from the training sets. One way to address these\\nshortcomings is to have a better control over the training sets, in particular\\nby using synthetic sets. In this paper, we propose a synthetic image generator\\nrelying on a few simple principles. In particular, we focus on geometric\\nmodeling, textures, and a simple modeling of image acquisition. These\\nproperties, integrated in a classical Dead Leaves model, enable the creation of\\nefficient training sets. Standard image denoising and super-resolution networks\\ncan be trained on such datasets, reaching performance almost on par with\\ntraining on natural image datasets. As a first step towards explainability, we\\nprovide a careful analysis of the considered principles, identifying which\\nimage properties are necessary to obtain good performances. Besides, such\\ntraining also yields better robustness to various geometric and radiometric\\nperturbations of the test sets.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T13:09:49Z\"}"}
