{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04743v1\", \"title\": \"AnyArtisticGlyph: Multilingual Controllable Artistic Glyph Generation\", \"summary\": \"Artistic Glyph Image Generation (AGIG) differs from current\\ncreativity-focused generation models by offering finely controllable\\ndeterministic generation. It transfers the style of a reference image to a\\nsource while preserving its content. Although advanced and promising, current\\nmethods may reveal flaws when scrutinizing synthesized image details, often\\nproducing blurred or incorrect textures, posing a significant challenge. Hence,\\nwe introduce AnyArtisticGlyph, a diffusion-based, multilingual controllable\\nartistic glyph generation model. It includes a font fusion and embedding\\nmodule, which generates latent features for detailed structure creation, and a\\nvision-text fusion and embedding module that uses the CLIP model to encode\\nreferences and blends them with transformation caption embeddings for seamless\\nglobal image generation. Moreover, we incorporate a coarse-grained\\nfeature-level loss to enhance generation accuracy. Experiments show that it\\nproduces natural, detailed artistic glyph images with state-of-the-art\\nperformance. Our project will be open-sourced on\\nhttps://github.com/jiean001/AnyArtisticGlyph to advance text generation\\ntechnology.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T05:37:39Z\"}"}
