Here, we present an analysis methodology\\nto map the gas disk structure and substructure encoded in 12CO, 13CO, and CS\\nline emission from our targets. To model and characterize the disk structure\\nprobed by optically thin species, such as CS and, in some cases, 13CO, we\\nintroduce a composite line profile kernel that accounts for increased\\nintensities caused by the projected overlap between the disk's front and back\\nside emission. Our workflow, built on the Discminer modelling framework,\\nincorporates an improved iterative two-component fitting method for inclined\\nsources ($i>40^\\\\circ$), to mitigate the impact of the disk backside on the\\nextraction of velocity maps. Also, we report best-fit parameters for the\\nKeplerian stellar masses, as well as inclinations, position angles, systemic\\nvelocities, rotation direction, and emission surfaces of the disks in our\\nsample.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:02:28Z\"}"}
