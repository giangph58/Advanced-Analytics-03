{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04419v1\", \"title\": \"Recognizing Ornaments in Vocal Indian Art Music with Active Annotation\", \"summary\": \"Ornamentations, embellishments, or microtonal inflections are essential to\\nmelodic expression across many musical traditions, adding depth, nuance, and\\nemotional impact to performances. Recognizing ornamentations in singing voices\\nis key to MIR, with potential applications in music pedagogy, singer\\nidentification, genre classification, and controlled singing voice generation.\\nHowever, the lack of annotated datasets and specialized modeling approaches\\nremains a major obstacle for progress in this research area. In this work, we\\nintroduce R\\\\=aga Ornamentation Detection (ROD), a novel dataset comprising\\nIndian classical music recordings curated by expert musicians. The dataset is\\nannotated using a custom Human-in-the-Loop tool for six vocal ornaments marked\\nas event-based labels. Using this dataset, we develop an ornamentation\\ndetection model based on deep time-series analysis, preserving ornament\\nboundaries during the chunking of long audio recordings. We conduct experiments\\nusing different train-test configurations within the ROD dataset and also\\nevaluate our approach on a separate, manually annotated dataset of Indian\\nclassical concert recordings. Our experimental results support the superior\\nperformance of our proposed approach over the baseline CRNN.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.AS\", \"categories\": \"eess.AS,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T13:52:50Z\"}"}
