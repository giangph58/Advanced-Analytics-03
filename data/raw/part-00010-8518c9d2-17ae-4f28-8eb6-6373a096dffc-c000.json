{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03604v1\", \"title\": \"Self-limited tidal heating and prolonged magma oceans in the L 98-59\\n  system\", \"summary\": \"Rocky exoplanets accessible to characterisation often lie on close-in orbits\\nwhere tidal heating within their interiors is significant, with the L 98-59\\nplanetary system being a prime example. As a long-term energy source for\\nongoing mantle melting and outgassing, tidal heating has been considered as a\\nway to replenish lost atmospheres on rocky planets around active M-dwarfs. We\\nsimulate the early evolution of L 98-59 b, c and d using a time-evolved\\ninterior-atmosphere modelling framework, with a self-consistent implementation\\nof tidal heating and redox-controlled outgassing. Emerging from our\\ncalculations is a novel self-limiting mechanism between radiative cooling,\\ntidal heating, and mantle rheology, which we term the 'radiation-tide-rheology\\nfeedback'. Our coupled modelling yields self-limiting tidal heating estimates\\nthat are up to two orders of magnitude lower than previous calculations, and\\nyet are still large enough to enable the extension of primordial magma oceans\\nto Gyr timescales. Comparisons with a semi-analytic model demonstrate that this\\nnegative feedback is a robust mechanism which can probe a given planet's\\ninitial conditions, atmospheric composition, and interior structure. The orbit\\nand instellation of the sub-Venus L 98-59 b likely place it in a regime where\\ntidal heating has kept the planet molten up to the present day, even if it were\\nto have lost its atmosphere. For c and d, a long-lived magma ocean can be\\ninduced by tides only with additional atmospheric regulation of energy\\ntransport.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:04:30Z\"}"}
