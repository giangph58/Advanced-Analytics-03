The goal of this work is to estimate the\\naverage upward heat flux measured by the nondimensional Nusselt number $Nu$ in\\nterms of the Rayleigh number $Ra$, which is a nondimensional quantity measuring\\nthe imposed temperature gradient. We derive bounds on the Nusselt number that\\ncoincide for relatively small slip lengths with the optimal Nusselt number\\nscaling for no-slip boundaries, $Nu\\\\lesssim Ra^{1/3}$; for relatively large\\nslip lengths, we recover scaling estimates for free-slip boundaries,\\n$Nu\\\\lesssim Ra^{5/12}$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T10:34:39Z\"}"}
