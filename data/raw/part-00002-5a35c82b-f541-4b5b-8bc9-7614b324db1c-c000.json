However, IRS\\nperformance relies on accurately configuring the phase shifts of reflecting\\nelements, which introduces substantial phase shift information (PSI) delivery\\noverhead, especially in large-scale or rapidly changing environments. This\\npaper first introduces the architecture of IRS-assisted systems and highlights\\nreal-world use cases where PSI delivery becomes a critical bottleneck. It then\\nreviews current PSI compression approaches, outlining their limitations in\\nadaptability and scalability. To address these gaps, we propose a prompt-guided\\nPSI compression framework that leverages task-aware prompts and meta-learning\\nto achieve efficient and real-time PSI delivery under diverse conditions.\\nSimulation results show improved reconstruction accuracy and robustness\\ncompared to the baseline method. Finally, we discuss open challenges and\\noutline promising directions for future research.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:19:57Z\"}"}
