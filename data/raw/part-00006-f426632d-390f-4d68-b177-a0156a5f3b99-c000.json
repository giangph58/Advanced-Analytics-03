{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20912v1\", \"title\": \"On the Secrecy-Sensing Optimization of RIS-assisted Full-Duplex\\n  Integrated Sensing and Communication Network\", \"summary\": \"Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has recently emerged as a viable\\ntechnique for establishing sensing and communication using the same resources.\\nNonetheless, the operation of ISAC networks is often challenged by the absence\\nof a direct link between the sensing node and the targets, and by the risk of\\ndisclosing confidential data to malicious targets when using the same signal\\nfor both tasks. In this paper, a robust reconfigurable intelligent surface\\n(RIS)-aided scheme for securing a full-duplex (FD) ISAC network is proposed.\\nThe considered network consists of uplink and downlink users served in FD\\nthrough a multi-antenna dual-functional radar communication base station (BS),\\nwhich employs co-located multi-antenna communication-radar arrays to detect\\nmultiple malicious targets while preserving communication secrecy in their\\npresence. Additionally, the BS utilizes an optimized artificial noise (AN) that\\nserves to disrupt the malicious targets' reception and increase the sensing\\npower. By optimally designing the RIS phase shifts, transmit beamforming, AN\\ncovariance, and uplink users' transmit power and combining vectors using an\\nalternating optimization-based algorithm, the network's sensing performance is\\nmaximized under secrecy and total power constraints. Numerical results present\\nthe proposed scheme's efficacy, particularly when a direct link between the BS\\nand the various nodes/targets is absent.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,eess.SP,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T16:32:22Z\"}"}
