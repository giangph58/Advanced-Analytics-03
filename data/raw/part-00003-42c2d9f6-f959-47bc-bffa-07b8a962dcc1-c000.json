{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17431v1\", \"title\": \"The resonance parameters of the vector charmonium-like state $G(3900)$\", \"summary\": \"Motivated by the updated analysis of the $G(3900)$ by the BESIII\\ncollaboration, we perform a global analysis of the cross sections of the\\n$e^+e^-\\\\to D\\\\bar{D}$, $e^+e^-\\\\to D\\\\bar{D}^*+c.c.$, $e^+e^-\\\\to D^*\\\\bar{D}^*$\\nprocesses, especially focusing on the properties of the $G(3900)$. As the\\nenergy region of interest is limited by the next opening threshold, i.e. the\\n$D_1\\\\bar{D}$ threshold, we focus on the energy region\\n$[3.7,4.25]~\\\\mathrm{GeV}$, where three charmonia $\\\\psi(1D)$, $\\\\psi(3S)$ and\\n$\\\\psi(2D)$ explicitly contribute to the cross sections. By constructing the\\n$P$-wave contact interaction between the $(D,D^*)$ doublet and its antiparticle\\nin the heavy quark limit, we extract the physical scattering amplitude by\\nsolving the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. No matter whether three or two\\ncharmonium states are included in our framework, we always find a dynamically\\ngenerated state corresponding to the $G(3900)$, which suggests it to be a\\n$P$-wave dynamically generated state. We also predict several dynamically\\ngenerated states in the corresponding $1^{-+}$ channel. These states can be\\nfurther searched for in the electron-positron annihilation process involving\\nthe emission of a single photon.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T10:46:16Z\"}"}
