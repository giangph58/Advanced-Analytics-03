{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00689v1\", \"title\": \"Axially symmetric collapses in the 2-D Benjamin-Ono equation\", \"summary\": \"We study the nonlinear dynamics of localized perturbations within the\\nframework of the essentially two-dimensional generalization of the Benjamin-Ono\\nequation (2D-BO) derived asymptotically from the Navier-Stokes equation. By\\nsimulating the 2D-BO equation with the pseudospectral method, we confirm that\\nthe localized initial perturbations exceeding a certain threshold collapse,\\nforming a point singularity. Although the 2D-BO equation does not possess axial\\nsymmetry, we show that in the vicinity of the collapse singularity, the\\nsolution becomes axially-symmetric, whatever its initial shape. We find that\\nperturbations collapse in a self-similar manner, with the perturbation\\namplitude exploding as $ (\\\\check \\\\tau)^{-\\\\lambda}$ and its transverse scale\\nshrinking as $ (\\\\check \\\\tau)^{\\\\lambda}$, where $\\\\check \\\\tau$ is the time to the\\nmoment of singularity. We derive a family of self-similar solutions describing\\naxially symmetric collapses. The value of the free parameter $ {\\\\lambda}$ in\\nthe self-similar solution is specified by fitting it to the numerical\\nsimulation of the initial problem of the evolution of an initially localized\\nperturbation. Remarkably, for the examples we examined the value of the\\nparameter proved to be almost universal: $ {\\\\lambda} \\\\approx 0.9$; its\\ndependence on the initial conditions is indiscernible. In the vicinity of the\\nsingularity, the dynamics becomes one-dimensional, thus, the derived reduction\\nof the 2D-BO equation provides an effectively one-dimensional model of\\ncollapse.\", \"main_category\": \"math-ph\", \"categories\": \"math-ph,math.MP,nlin.PS\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T17:51:03Z\"}"}
