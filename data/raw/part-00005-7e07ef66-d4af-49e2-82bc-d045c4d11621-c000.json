In this\\nwork, we address the synthesis of a compliant cross-hinge mechanism capable of\\nlarge angular strokes while approximating the behavior of an ideal revolute\\njoint. To capture the competing demands of kinematic fidelity, rotational\\nstiffness, and resistance to parasitic motion, we formulate a multi-objective\\noptimization problem based on kinetostatic performance measures. A hybrid\\ndesign strategy is employed: an efficient beam-based structural model enables\\nextensive exploration of a high-dimensional design space using evolutionary\\nalgorithms, followed by fine-tuning with high-fidelity three-dimensional finite\\nelement analysis. The resulting Pareto-optimal designs reveal diverse geometric\\nconfigurations and performance trade-offs.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA,cs.NE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T06:29:10Z\"}"}
