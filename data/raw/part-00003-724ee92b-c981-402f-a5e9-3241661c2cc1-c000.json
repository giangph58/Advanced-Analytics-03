Li, K. Yang, W. Wong, Advances in Neural Information\\nProcessing Systems (2016) 1099-1107] to learn an adaptive piecewise constant\\napproximation defined on a binary sequential partition of the underlying\\ndomain, where the star discrepancy is adopted to measure the uniformity of\\nparticle distribution. However, the calculation of the star discrepancy is\\nNP-hard and it does not satisfy the reflection invariance and rotation\\ninvariance either. To this end, we use the mixture discrepancy and the\\ncomparison of moments as a replacement of the star discrepancy, leading to the\\ndensity estimation via mixture discrepancy based sequential partition (DSP-mix)\\nand density estimation via moments based sequential partition (MSP),\\nrespectively. Both DSP-mix and MSP are computationally tractable and exhibit\\nthe reflection and rotation invariance. Numerical experiments in reconstructing\\nthe $d$-D mixture of Gaussians and Betas with $d=2, 3, \\\\dots, 6$ demonstrate\\nthat DSP-mix and MSP both run approximately ten times faster than DSP while\\nmaintaining the same accuracy.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ML\", \"categories\": \"stat.ML,cs.LG,physics.comp-ph,stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T10:15:03Z\"}"}
