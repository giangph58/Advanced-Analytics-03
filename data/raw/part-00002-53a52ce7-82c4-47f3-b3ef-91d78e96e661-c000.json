{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10146v1\", \"title\": \"GeoUni: A Unified Model for Generating Geometry Diagrams, Problems and\\n  Problem Solutions\", \"summary\": \"We propose GeoUni, the first unified geometry expert model capable of\\ngenerating problem solutions and diagrams within a single framework in a way\\nthat enables the creation of unique and individualized geometry problems.\\nTraditionally, solving geometry problems and generating diagrams have been\\ntreated as separate tasks in machine learning, with no models successfully\\nintegrating both to support problem creation. However, we believe that mastery\\nin geometry requires frictionless integration of all of these skills, from\\nsolving problems to visualizing geometric relationships, and finally, crafting\\ntailored problems. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoUni, with only\\n1.5B parameters, achieves performance comparable to larger models such as\\nDeepSeek-R1 with 671B parameters in geometric reasoning tasks. GeoUni also\\nexcels in generating precise geometric diagrams, surpassing both text-to-image\\nmodels and unified models, including the GPT-4o image generation. Most\\nimportantly, GeoUni is the only model capable of successfully generating\\ntextual problems with matching diagrams based on specific knowledge points,\\nthus offering a wider range of capabilities that extend beyond current models.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T11:56:55Z\"}"}
