{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11363v1\", \"title\": \"Smartphone-Based Undergraduate Physics Labs: A Comprehensive Review of\\n  Innovation, Accessibility, and Pedagogical Impact\", \"summary\": \"Smartphone-integrated physics laboratories (SmartIPLs) have emerged as\\nscalable and cost-effective alternatives to traditional lab instruction,\\nproviding accessible, hands-on experiences for diverse learning environments.\\nThis review synthesizes over a decade of research, covering nearly 200\\nSmartIPLs across key physics domains such as mechanics, optics, acoustics,\\nelectromagnetism, thermodynamics, and modern physics. SmartIPLs are categorized\\ninto two primary types: sensor-based experiments using built-in smartphone\\ntools and camera-based video/image analysis for motion and optical studies.\\nEmpirical studies show that SmartIPLs support equal or greater gains in\\nconceptual understanding, science process skills, and student engagement,\\nespecially in remote and under-resourced settings. The review explores their\\ntheoretical foundations, compares them to traditional and virtual labs, and\\naddresses challenges such as device variability and classroom integration.\\nFuture directions include broader curricular integration, AI-driven student\\nfeedback, expansion into underrepresented physics topics, interdisciplinary\\napplications, and equity-focused instructional design. Open-access resources,\\nsuch as the UGA SmartPhone Intro Physics Lab and Modern Optics YouTube channels\\nand the SPIE book Use of Smartphones in Optical Experimentation, highlight\\ncommunity-driven efforts to expand and democratize physics education. As\\nsmartphone technology advances, SmartIPLs will offer a promising path toward\\nadaptive, intelligent, and inclusive laboratory instruction for the 21st\\ncentury.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ed-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ed-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:28:13Z\"}"}
