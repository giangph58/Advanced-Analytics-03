{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05148v1\", \"title\": \"A Benchmark Dataset and a Framework for Urdu Multimodal Named Entity\\n  Recognition\", \"summary\": \"The emergence of multimodal content, particularly text and images on social\\nmedia, has positioned Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (MNER) as an\\nincreasingly important area of research within Natural Language Processing.\\nDespite progress in high-resource languages such as English, MNER remains\\nunderexplored for low-resource languages like Urdu. The primary challenges\\ninclude the scarcity of annotated multimodal datasets and the lack of\\nstandardized baselines. To address these challenges, we introduce the U-MNER\\nframework and release the Twitter2015-Urdu dataset, a pioneering resource for\\nUrdu MNER. Adapted from the widely used Twitter2015 dataset, it is annotated\\nwith Urdu-specific grammar rules. We establish benchmark baselines by\\nevaluating both text-based and multimodal models on this dataset, providing\\ncomparative analyses to support future research on Urdu MNER. The U-MNER\\nframework integrates textual and visual context using Urdu-BERT for text\\nembeddings and ResNet for visual feature extraction, with a Cross-Modal Fusion\\nModule to align and fuse information. Our model achieves state-of-the-art\\nperformance on the Twitter2015-Urdu dataset, laying the groundwork for further\\nMNER research in low-resource languages.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T11:38:20Z\"}"}
