{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15119v1\", \"title\": \"FRB cosmology with the RM-PRS Luminosity Correlation\", \"summary\": \"Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as a powerful tool for cosmological\\nstudies, particularly through the dispersion measure-redshift ($\\\\mathrm{DM}-z$)\\nrelation. This work proposes a novel calibration method for FRBs using the\\nYang-Li-Zhang (YLZ) empirical relation, which links the rotation measure (RM)\\nof FRBs to the luminosity of their associated persistent radio sources (PRS).\\nWe demonstrate that this approach provides independent constraints on\\ncosmological parameters, bypassing limitations inherent to traditional\\n$\\\\mathrm{DM}-z$ method. Utilizing the current sample of four YLZ-calibrated\\nFRBs, we derive a Hubble constant measurement of $H_0 =\\n86.18_{-14.99}^{+18.03}\\\\ \\\\mathrm{km\\\\ s^{-1}\\\\ Mpc^{-1}}$ (68\\\\% CL). Monte Carlo\\nsimulations indicate that a future catalog of 400 FRB-PSR systems could reduce\\nthe relative uncertainty of $H_0$ to 4.5\\\\%. Combining YLZ-calibrated FRBs with\\n$\\\\mathrm{DM}-z$ sample reveals critical synergies: joint analysis of equalized\\nsamples ($N=100$ for both methods) reduces the relative uncertainty of $H_0$ to\\n2.9\\\\%, mainly because the incorporation of PRS observations substantially\\nmitigates the degeneracy between the parameters such as IGM baryon mass\\nfraction ($f_{\\\\rm IGM}$) and other cosmological parameters inherent to the\\n$\\\\mathrm{DM}-z$ relation.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T14:17:03Z\"}"}
