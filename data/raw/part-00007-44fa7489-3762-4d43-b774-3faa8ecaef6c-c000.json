{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15965v1\", \"title\": \"From Human Memory to AI Memory: A Survey on Memory Mechanisms in the Era\\n  of LLMs\", \"summary\": \"Memory is the process of encoding, storing, and retrieving information,\\nallowing humans to retain experiences, knowledge, skills, and facts over time,\\nand serving as the foundation for growth and effective interaction with the\\nworld. It plays a crucial role in shaping our identity, making decisions,\\nlearning from past experiences, building relationships, and adapting to\\nchanges. In the era of large language models (LLMs), memory refers to the\\nability of an AI system to retain, recall, and use information from past\\ninteractions to improve future responses and interactions. Although previous\\nresearch and reviews have provided detailed descriptions of memory mechanisms,\\nthere is still a lack of a systematic review that summarizes and analyzes the\\nrelationship between the memory of LLM-driven AI systems and human memory, as\\nwell as how we can be inspired by human memory to construct more powerful\\nmemory systems. To achieve this, in this paper, we propose a comprehensive\\nsurvey on the memory of LLM-driven AI systems. In particular, we first conduct\\na detailed analysis of the categories of human memory and relate them to the\\nmemory of AI systems. Second, we systematically organize existing\\nmemory-related work and propose a categorization method based on three\\ndimensions (object, form, and time) and eight quadrants. Finally, we illustrate\\nsome open problems regarding the memory of current AI systems and outline\\npossible future directions for memory in the era of large language models.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR,H.0\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T15:05:04Z\"}"}
