The research focuses on\\nderiving fundamental convergence results for the series and analyzing its\\nasymptotic convergence behavior. The study estimates the rate of convergence\\nusing the weighted logarithmic modulus of continuity and establishes a\\nquantitative Voronovskaja-type theorem offering insights into the asymptotic\\nbehavior of the series. Additionally, we present the example of kernel\\nfunctions satisfying assumptions of the presented theory along with graphical\\ndemonstration and estimates of approximation.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T10:45:03Z\"}"}
