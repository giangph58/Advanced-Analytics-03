{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09888v1\", \"title\": \"Scalable fluxonium qubit architecture with tunable interactions between\\n  non-computational levels\", \"summary\": \"The fluxonium qubit has emerged as a promising candidate for superconducting\\nquantum computing due to its long coherence times and high-fidelity gates.\\nNonetheless, further scaling up and improving performance remain critical\\nchallenges for establishing fluxoniums as a viable alternative to transmons. A\\nkey obstacle lies in developing scalable coupling architectures. In this work,\\nwe introduce a scalable fluxonium architecture that enables decoupling of qubit\\nstates while maintaining tunable couplings between non-computational states.\\nBeyond the well-studied ZZ crosstalk, we identify that an always-on interaction\\ninvolving non-computational levels can significantly degrade the fidelities of\\ninitialization, control, and readout in large systems, thereby impeding\\nscalability. We demonstrate that this issue can be mitigated by implementing\\ntunable couplings for fluxonium's plasmon transitions, meanwhile enabling fast,\\nhigh-fidelity gates with passive ZZ suppression. Furthermore, since fluxonium\\ntransitions span multiple frequency octaves, we emphasize the importance of\\ncarefully designing coupling mechanisms and parameters to suppress residual\\ninteractions.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T05:31:47Z\"}"}
