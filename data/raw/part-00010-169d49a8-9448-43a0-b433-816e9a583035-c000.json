{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10976v1\", \"title\": \"Adaptive Decision Boundary for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning\", \"summary\": \"Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) aims to continuously learn new\\nclasses from a limited set of training samples without forgetting knowledge of\\npreviously learned classes. Conventional FSCIL methods typically build a robust\\nfeature extractor during the base training session with abundant training\\nsamples and subsequently freeze this extractor, only fine-tuning the classifier\\nin subsequent incremental phases. However, current strategies primarily focus\\non preventing catastrophic forgetting, considering only the relationship\\nbetween novel and base classes, without paying attention to the specific\\ndecision spaces of each class. To address this challenge, we propose a\\nplug-and-play Adaptive Decision Boundary Strategy (ADBS), which is compatible\\nwith most FSCIL methods. Specifically, we assign a specific decision boundary\\nto each class and adaptively adjust these boundaries during training to\\noptimally refine the decision spaces for the classes in each session.\\nFurthermore, to amplify the distinctiveness between classes, we employ a novel\\ninter-class constraint loss that optimizes the decision boundaries and\\nprototypes for each class. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks, namely\\nCIFAR100, miniImageNet, and CUB200, demonstrate that incorporating our ADBS\\nmethod with existing FSCIL techniques significantly improves performance,\\nachieving overall state-of-the-art results.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T08:37:24Z\"}"}
