The task\\nrequired creating subject predictions for bibliographic records from the\\nbilingual TIBKAT database using the GND subject vocabulary. Our approach\\ncombines traditional natural language processing and machine learning\\ntechniques implemented in the Annif toolkit with innovative LLM-based methods\\nfor translation and synthetic data generation, and merging predictions from\\nmonolingual models. The system ranked first in the all-subjects category and\\nsecond in the tib-core-subjects category in the quantitative evaluation, and\\nfourth in qualitative evaluations. These findings demonstrate the potential of\\ncombining traditional XMTC algorithms with modern LLM techniques to improve the\\naccuracy and efficiency of subject indexing in multilingual contexts.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI,cs.DL,cs.IR,cs.LG,I.2.7\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T11:04:23Z\"}"}
