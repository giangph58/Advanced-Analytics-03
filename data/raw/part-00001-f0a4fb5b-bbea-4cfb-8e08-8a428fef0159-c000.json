In this work, we study axion mass mixing within the type IIB string\\naxiverse, focusing specifically on the LARGE volume scenario (LVS) axiverse.\\nThe LVS axiverse necessitates at least two axions to ensure the presence of\\nboth a QCD axion candidate and at least one additional axion-like particle\\n(ALP). This study presents the first systematic exploration of axion mass\\nmixing in scenarios involving more than two axions. The maximal mixing occurs\\nwhen the masses of all ALPs are smaller than the zero-temperature mass of the\\nQCD axion, with no two ALP masses being equal, and when the decay constants of\\nall ALPs are simultaneously either smaller or larger than the decay constant of\\nthe QCD axion. Additionally, the transfer of axion energy density ultimately\\ntakes place only between the two axions with the closest masses. These findings\\nprovide critical insights into axion dynamics not only within type IIB string\\naxiverse models but also in broader multi-axion mixing frameworks. The\\npotential cosmological implications of axion mass mixing are also addressed at\\nthe end. Our work contributes to the understanding of axion physics in string\\ntheory.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T12:24:46Z\"}"}
