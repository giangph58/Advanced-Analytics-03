This approach goes beyond traditional accuracy metrics by addressing\\nfour second-order challenges: catastrophic forgetting (where new learning\\noverwrites past knowledge), lack of plasticity (where models fail to adapt to\\nnew data), forward transfer (using past knowledge to improve future learning),\\nand backward transfer (refining past knowledge with insights from new domains).\\nThe method comprises a feature generator and domain-specific classifiers,\\nallowing capacity to grow as new domains emerge with minimal interference,\\nwhile an experience replay mechanism selectively revisits prior domains to\\nmitigate forgetting. Moreover, nonlinear dependencies across domains are\\nexploited by prioritizing replay from those with the highest prior errors,\\nrefining models based on most informative past experiences. Experiments show\\nhigh average domain accuracy (up to 88.96%), with forgetting measures as low as\\n.0027 across non-stationary class-incremental environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T12:02:32Z\"}"}
