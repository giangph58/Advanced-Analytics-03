Their approach indicates how lower twisted moments of $\\\\zeta(s)$\\nmay be used to evaluate higher moments. In this paper, we present a rigorous\\nrandom matrix theory analogue of their heuristic. To do this, we develop a\\nnotion of \\\"twisted moment\\\" of characteristic polynomials of matrices in the\\nunitary group $U(N)$, and we prove several identities involving Schur\\npolynomials. Our results may be viewed as a proof of concept of the heuristic\\nfor $\\\\zeta(s)$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT,math-ph,math.CO,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T16:51:19Z\"}"}
