A key insight of our approach is the use\\nof generalized Mellin space, and a decomposition of the correlators into\\ndistinct subsectors each one characterized by different on-shell constraints\\namong the Mellin variables. The resulting Mellin amplitudes involve a small set\\nof building blocks with manifest properties under a six-dimensional symmetry.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T13:12:40Z\"}"}
