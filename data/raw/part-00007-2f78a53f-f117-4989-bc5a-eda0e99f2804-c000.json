Color centers in\\nnanodiamond offer unique advantages for quantum sensing and information\\nprocessing; however, their integration into complex optical architectures is\\nlimited by challenges in precise and reproducible positioning, as well as\\nefficient coupling. DNA origami provides an elegant solution, as demonstrated\\nby recent studies showcasing nanoscale positioning of fluorescent nanodiamonds\\nand plasmonic gold nanoparticles. Here, we present a scalable and robust method\\nfor covalently functionalizing nanodiamonds with DNA, enabling high-yield,\\nspatially controlled assembly of diamond and gold nanoparticles onto DNA\\norigami. By precisely controlling the interparticle spacing, we reveal\\ndistance-dependent modulation of NV center photoluminescence with a 10-fold\\nincrease in the fastest decay pathway at short interparticle distances. Our\\nfindings indicate selective plasmon-driven effects and interplay between\\nradiative and non-radiative processes. This work overcomes key limitations in\\ncurrent nanodiamond assembly strategies and provides insights into engineering\\nNV photoluminescence by plasmonic coupling that advance toward quantum photonic\\nand sensing applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T14:02:04Z\"}"}
