In\\nthis work, we make this theorem effective by establishing an explicit rate of\\nconvergence. Our result extends to the setting of higher-dimensional\\nsimultaneous Diophantine approximation, thereby providing an effective version\\nof a theorem of Cheung and Chevallier (\\\\textit{Annales scientifiques de l'ENS},\\n2024). In addition, we prove a central limit theorem for best approximations.\\nOur approach relies on techniques from homogeneous dynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT,math.DS,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T12:57:04Z\"}"}
