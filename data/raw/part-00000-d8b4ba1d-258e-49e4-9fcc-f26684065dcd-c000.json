Before the\\ndeformation, the seed model can be understood as a sector of the\\n$\\\\mathfrak{psu}(2,2|4)$-invariant spin-chain encoding the spectral problem of\\n$\\\\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills at one loop in the planar limit. The\\ndeformation gives rise to interesting features because, while being integrable,\\nthe Hamiltonian is non-hermitian and non-diagonalisable, so that it only admits\\na Jordan decomposition. Moreover, the eigenvalues of the deformed Hamiltonian\\ncoincide with those of the original undeformed spin-chain. We use explicit\\nexamples as well as the techniques of the coordinate and of the algebraic Bethe\\nansatz to discuss the construction of the (generalised) eigenvectors of the\\ndeformed model. We also show that the deformed spin-chain is equivalent to an\\nundeformed one with twisted boundary conditions, and that it may be derived\\nfrom a scaling limit of the non-compact $U_q(\\\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-invariant\\n$XXZ_{-1/2} $ spin-chain.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,cond-mat.stat-mech,cond-mat.str-el,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:38:04Z\"}"}
