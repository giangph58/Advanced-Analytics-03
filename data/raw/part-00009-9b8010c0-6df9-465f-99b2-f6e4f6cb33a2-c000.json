{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20408v1\", \"title\": \"FourierSpecNet: Neural Collision Operator Approximation Inspired by the\\n  Fourier Spectral Method for Solving the Boltzmann Equation\", \"summary\": \"The Boltzmann equation, a fundamental model in kinetic theory, describes the\\nevolution of particle distribution functions through a nonlinear,\\nhigh-dimensional collision operator. However, its numerical solution remains\\ncomputationally demanding, particularly for inelastic collisions and\\nhigh-dimensional velocity domains. In this work, we propose the Fourier Neural\\nSpectral Network (FourierSpecNet), a hybrid framework that integrates the\\nFourier spectral method with deep learning to approximate the collision\\noperator in Fourier space efficiently. FourierSpecNet achieves\\nresolution-invariant learning and supports zero-shot super-resolution, enabling\\naccurate predictions at unseen resolutions without retraining. Beyond empirical\\nvalidation, we establish a consistency result showing that the trained operator\\nconverges to the spectral solution as the discretization is refined. We\\nevaluate our method on several benchmark cases, including Maxwellian and\\nhard-sphere molecular models, as well as inelastic collision scenarios. The\\nresults demonstrate that FourierSpecNet offers competitive accuracy while\\nsignificantly reducing computational cost compared to traditional spectral\\nsolvers. Our approach provides a robust and scalable alternative for solving\\nthe Boltzmann equation across both elastic and inelastic regimes.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.NA,math.NA,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T04:07:03Z\"}"}
