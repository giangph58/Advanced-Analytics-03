Due to aging, the\\nsystem never reaches a stationary state but instead evolves on emergent scales\\nthat grow with its age. This slow evolution complicates field-theoretic\\ndescriptions, as the weak long-term memory and the absence of a stationary\\nstate hinder simplifications of the memory, always leading to the worst-case\\nscaling of computational effort with the cubic power of the simulated time.\\nHere, we present an algorithm based on two-dimensional interpolations of\\nGreen's functions, which resolves this issue and achieves sublinear scaling of\\ncomputational cost. We apply it to the quench dynamics of the spherical mixed\\n$p$-spin model to establish the existence of a phase transition between glasses\\nwith strong and weak ergodicity breaking at a finite temperature of the initial\\nstate. By reaching times three orders of magnitude larger than previously\\nattainable, we determine the critical exponents of this transition.\\nInterestingly, these are continuously varying and, therefore, non-universal.\\nWhile we introduce and validate the method in the context of a glassy system,\\nit is equally applicable to any model with overdamped excitations.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:04:31Z\"}"}
