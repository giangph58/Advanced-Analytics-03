Up to authors' knowledge this is the first work addressing this\\nsecond-order quantitative stability estimate in general unbounded settings. Our\\nproof strategy relies on semiconcavity properties of entropic potentials and on\\nthe representation of entropic transport plans as laws of forward and backward\\ndiffusion processes, known as Schr\\\\\\\"odinger bridges. Moreover, our approach\\nallows to deduce a stochastic proof of quantitative stability entropic\\nestimates and integrated gradient estimates as well. Finally, as a direct\\nconsequence of these stability bounds, we deduce exponential convergence rates\\nfor gradient and Hessian of Sinkhorn iterates along Sinkhorn's algorithm, a\\nproblem that was still open in unbounded settings. Our rates have a polynomial\\ndependence on the regularization parameter.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,math.AP,math.OC,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T12:34:09Z\"}"}
