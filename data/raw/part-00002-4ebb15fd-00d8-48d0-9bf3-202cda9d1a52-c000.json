{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07623v1\", \"title\": \"Joint Travel Route Optimization Framework for Platooning\", \"summary\": \"Platooning represents an advanced driving technology designed to assist\\ndrivers in traffic convoys of varying lengths, enhancing road safety, reducing\\ndriver fatigue, and improving fuel efficiency. Sophisticated automated driving\\nassistance systems have facilitated this innovation. Recent advancements in\\nplatooning emphasize cooperative mechanisms within both centralized and\\ndecentralized architectures enabled by vehicular communication technologies.\\nThis study introduces a cooperative route planning optimization framework aimed\\nat promoting the adoption of platooning through a centralized platoon formation\\nstrategy at the system level. This approach is envisioned as a transitional\\nphase from individual (ego) driving to fully collaborative driving.\\nAdditionally, this research formulates and incorporates travel cost metrics\\nrelated to fuel consumption, driver fatigue, and travel time, considering\\nregulatory constraints on consecutive driving durations. The performance of\\nthese cost metrics has been evaluated using Dijkstra's and A* shortest path\\nalgorithms within a network graph framework. The results indicate that the\\nproposed architecture achieves an average cost improvement of 14 % compared to\\nindividual route planning for long road trips.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.ET\", \"categories\": \"cs.ET,cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T10:13:20Z\"}"}
