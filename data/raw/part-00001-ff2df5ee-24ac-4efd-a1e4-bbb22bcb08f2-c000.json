{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16770v1\", \"title\": \"DeBiasMe: De-biasing Human-AI Interactions with Metacognitive AIED (AI\\n  in Education) Interventions\", \"summary\": \"While generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) increasingly transforms\\nacademic environments, a critical gap exists in understanding and mitigating\\nhuman biases in AI interactions, such as anchoring and confirmation bias. This\\nposition paper advocates for metacognitive AI literacy interventions to help\\nuniversity students critically engage with AI and address biases across the\\nHuman-AI interaction workflows. The paper presents the importance of\\nconsidering (1) metacognitive support with deliberate friction focusing on\\nhuman bias; (2) bi-directional Human-AI interaction intervention addressing\\nboth input formulation and output interpretation; and (3) adaptive scaffolding\\nthat responds to diverse user engagement patterns. These frameworks are\\nillustrated through ongoing work on \\\"DeBiasMe,\\\" AIED (AI in Education)\\ninterventions designed to enhance awareness of cognitive biases while\\nempowering user agency in AI interactions. The paper invites multiple\\nstakeholders to engage in discussions on design and evaluation methods for\\nscaffolding mechanisms, bias visualization, and analysis frameworks. This\\nposition contributes to the emerging field of AI-augmented learning by\\nemphasizing the critical role of metacognition in helping students navigate the\\ncomplex interaction between human, statistical, and systemic biases in AI use\\nwhile highlighting how cognitive adaptation to AI systems must be explicitly\\nintegrated into comprehensive AI literacy frameworks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T14:41:31Z\"}"}
