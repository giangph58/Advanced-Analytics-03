{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20816v1\", \"title\": \"The Contextual Heisenberg Microscope\", \"summary\": \"The Heisenberg microscope provides a powerful mental image of the measurement\\nprocess of quantum mechanics (QM), attempting to explain the uncertainty\\nrelation through an uncontrollable back-action from the measurement device.\\nHowever, Heisenberg's proposed back-action uses features that are not present\\nin the QM description of the world, and according to Bohr not present in the\\nworld. Therefore, Bohr argues, the mental image proposed by Heisenberg should\\nbe avoided. Later developments by Bell and Kochen-Specker shows that a model\\nthat contains the features used for the Heisenberg microscope is in principle\\npossible but must necessarily be nonlocal and contextual. In this paper we will\\nre-examine the measurement process within a restriction of QM known as\\nStabilizer QM, that still exhibits for example Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger\\nnonlocality and Peres-Mermin contextuality. The re-examination will use a\\nrecent extension of stabilizer QM, the Contextual Ontological Model (COM),\\nwhere the system state gives a complete description of future measurement\\noutcomes reproducing the quantum predictions, including the mentioned\\nphenomena. We will see that the resulting contextual Heisenberg microscope\\nback-action can be completely described within COM, and that the associated\\nrandomness originates in the initial state of the pointer system, exactly as in\\nthe original description of the Heisenberg microscope. The presence of\\ncontextuality, usually seen as prohibiting ontological models, suggests that\\nthe contextual Heisenberg microscope picture can be enabled in general QM.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:33:27Z\"}"}
