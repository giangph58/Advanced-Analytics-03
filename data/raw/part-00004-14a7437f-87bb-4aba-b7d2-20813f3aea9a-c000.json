For the Hurwitz\\ncontinued fraction, we confirm Hirst's conjecture, as a complex analogue of the\\nresult of Wang and Wu [Bull. Lond. Math. Soc. {\\\\bf 40} (2008), no. 1, 18--22]\\nfor the regular continued fraction. We also prove a complex analogue of the\\nsecond-named author's result on the Hausdorff dimension of sets with restricted\\nslowly growing digits [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. {\\\\bf 151} (2023), no. 9,\\n3645--3653]. To these ends, we exploit an infinite conformal iterated function\\nsystem associated with the Hurwitz continued fraction.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS,math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T12:45:20Z\"}"}
