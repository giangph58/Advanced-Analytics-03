Here, we study how the coupling of a quantum system to a\\nnon-Markovian environment, i.e., an environment with a frequency-dependent\\nspectral density inducing memory effects, can be used to generate and reshape\\nphase transitions and squeezing in matter phases. Focusing on a\\nLipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, we demonstrate that non-Markovian dissipation can\\nbe leveraged to engineer tricriticality via the fusion of\\n$2^{\\\\mathrm{nd}}$-order and $1^{\\\\mathrm{st}}$-order critical points. We\\nidentify phases that arise from different ways of breaking the single weak\\nsymmetry of our model, which led us to introduce the concept of\\n\\\\textit{directional spontaneous symmetry breaking} (DSSB) as a general\\nframework to understand this phenomenon. We show that signatures of DSSB can be\\nseen in the emergence of spin squeezing along different directions, and that\\nthe latter is controllable via non-Markovian effects, opening up possibilities\\nfor applications in quantum metrology. Finally, we propose an experimental\\nimplementation of our non-Markovian model in cavity QED. Our work features\\nnon-Markovianity as a resource for controlling phase transitions in general\\nsystems, and highlights shortcomings of the Markovian limit in this context.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:58:15Z\"}"}
