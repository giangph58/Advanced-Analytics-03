Efficient scheduling is critical in maximizing infrastructure\\ncapacity and utilization while adhering as closely as possible to the requests\\nof railway undertakings. These objectives ultimately contribute to maximizing\\nthe infrastructure manager's revenues. This paper sets out a modular simulation\\nframework to reproduce the dynamics of deregulated railway systems. Ten\\nmetaheuristic algorithms using the MEALPY Python library are then evaluated in\\norder to optimize train schedules in the liberalized Spanish railway market.\\nThe results show that the Genetic Algorithm outperforms others in revenue\\noptimization, convergence speed, and schedule adherence. Alternatives, such as\\nParticle Swarm Optimization and Ant Colony Optimization Continuous, show slower\\nconvergence and higher variability. The results emphasize the trade-off between\\nscheduling more trains and adhering to requested times, providing insights into\\nsolving complex scheduling problems in deregulated railway systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NE\", \"categories\": \"cs.NE,cs.CE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T11:36:39Z\"}"}
