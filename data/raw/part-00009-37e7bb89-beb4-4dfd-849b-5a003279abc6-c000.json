{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07778v1\", \"title\": \"Active Matter Flocking via Predictive Alignment\", \"summary\": \"Understanding collective self-organization in active matter, such as bird\\nflocks and fish schools, remains a grand challenge in physics. Alignment\\ninteractions are essential for flocking, yet alone, they are generally\\nconsidered insufficient to maintain cohesion against noise, forcing traditional\\nmodels to rely on artificial boundaries or added attractive forces. Here, we\\nreport the first model to achieve cohesive flocking using purely alignment\\ninteractions, introducing predictive alignment: agents orient based on the\\npredicted future headings of their neighbors. Implemented in a discrete-time\\nVicsek-type framework, this approach delivers robust, noise-resistant cohesion\\nwithout additional parameters. In the stable regime, flock size scales linearly\\nwith interaction radius, remaining nearly immune to noise or propulsion speed,\\nand the group coherently follows a leader under noise. These findings reveal\\nhow predictive strategies enhance self-organization, paving the way for a new\\nclass of active matter models blending physics and cognitive-like dynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,nlin.AO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:18:17Z\"}"}
