Building on the recent work of Kharazishvili, we construct a\\nMazurkiewicz set that contains a Sierpi\\\\'{n}ski-Zygmund function in every\\ndirection and another one that contains none in any direction. Furthermore, we\\nshow that whether a Mazurkiewicz set can be expressed as a union of two\\nSierpi\\\\'{n}ski-Zygmund functions is independent of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory\\nwith the Axiom of Choice (ZFC). Some open problems related to the containment\\nof Hamel functions are stated.\", \"main_category\": \"math.LO\", \"categories\": \"math.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T03:04:18Z\"}"}
