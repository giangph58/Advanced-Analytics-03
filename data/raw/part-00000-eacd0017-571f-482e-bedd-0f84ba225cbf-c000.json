The problem is even more difficult\\nunder finite blocklength constraints that are popular in ultra-reliable\\nlow-latency communication (URLLC) and massive machine-type communications\\n(mMTC). This work takes the first step to guarantee secrecy for all URLLC/mMTC\\nusers in the finite blocklength regime (FBR) where intelligent reflecting\\nsurfaces (IRS) are used to enhance legitimate users' reception and thwart the\\npotential eavesdropper (Eve) from intercepting. To that end, we aim to maximize\\nthe minimum secrecy rate (SR) among all users by jointly optimizing the\\ntransmitter's beamforming and IRS's passive reflective elements (PREs) under\\nthe FBR latency constraints. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex\\nand even more complicated under imperfect channel state information (CSI). To\\ntackle it, we linearize the objective function, and decompose the problem into\\nsequential subproblems. When perfect CSI is not available, we use the\\nsuccessive convex approximation (SCA) approach to transform imperfect\\nCSI-related semi-infinite constraints into finite linear matrix inequalities\\n(LMI).\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:36:03Z\"}"}
