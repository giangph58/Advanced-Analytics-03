Age Dependence of the\\n  Occurrence and Architecture of Ultra-Short-Period Planet Systems\", \"summary\": \"Ultra-short-period (USP) planets, with orbital periods shorter than one day,\\nrepresent a unique class of exoplanets whose origin remains puzzling.\\nDetermining their age distribution and temporal evolution is vital for\\nuncovering their formation and evolutionary pathways. Using a sample of over\\n1,000 short-period planets around Sun-like stars, we find that the host stars\\nof USP planets are relatively older and have a higher prevalence in the\\nGalactic thick disk compared to stars hosting other short-period planets.\\nFurthermore, we find that the occurrence of USP planets increases with stellar\\nage and uncover evidence indicating that USP planetary system architectures\\nevolve on Gyr timescales. This includes a distinct dip-pileup in period\\ndistributions around ~1 day and an expansion of orbital spacings with time. In\\naddition, younger USP planet systems are observed to have fewer multiple\\ntransiting planets, implying fewer nearby companions and/or larger mutual\\norbital inclinations. Our findings suggest that USP planets continuously form\\nthrough inward migration driven by tidal dissipation over Gyr timescales, and\\nthat younger and older USP planets may have originated via different specific\\ntidal migration pathways.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:56:03Z\"}"}
