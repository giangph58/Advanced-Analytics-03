Our analysis reveals a\\nmulti-component ionized gas outflow structure in this heavily obscured AGN host\\ngalaxy. Multi-component Gaussian decomposition of the [O III] and H$\\\\alpha$\\nemission lines uncovers extremely broad and asymmetric profiles, characteristic\\nof AGN-driven outflows. Kinematic mapping shows spatially distinct structures:\\nthe [O III] and H$\\\\alpha$ dominated components (with radii of $1.20 \\\\pm 0.56$\\nkpc) are separated by a projected offset of $\\\\sim 1.1$ kpc and exhibit\\ndivergent velocity regimes. The [O III] outflow reaches a velocity of 3210\\n$\\\\pm$ 50 km s$^{-1}$, while the H$\\\\alpha$ outflow component attains 2310 $\\\\pm$\\n840 km s$^{-1}$. Dynamical modeling supports a biconical outflow structure,\\nwith [O III] and H$\\\\alpha$ emissions dominating separate cones and significant\\ndust obscuration of the redshifted outflow. Their comparable momentum outflow\\nrates and energy outflow rates suggest a potential physical connection in their\\ndriving mechanisms. Spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis reveals\\nanomalous optical/UV excess, attributed to AGN photon scattering by dust or\\noutflowing material, classifying W2026+0716 as a \\\"Blue Hot DOG\\\". The derived\\noutflow timescale ($\\\\sim10^{5}$ yr) aligns with the evolutionary phase of Blue\\nHot DOGs, suggesting AGN feedback operates persistently during this\\ntransitional stage.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T10:23:02Z\"}"}
