{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19884v1\", \"title\": \"Accretion and Recovery in Giant Eruptions of Massive Stars\", \"summary\": \"Giant Eruptions (GEs) are episodic high-rate mass loss events that massive\\nstars experience in the late stage of evolutions before exploding as a\\ncore-collapse supernova. If it occurs in a binary system, the companion star\\ncan accrete part of the mass. We use numerical simulations to analyze how the\\ncompanion responds to accretion and how its structure and evolution are\\naltered. We run a grid of massive stars with masses from $20~\\\\rm M_{\\\\odot}$ to\\n$60~\\\\rm M_{\\\\odot}$, and accretion rates from $\\\\rm 10^{-4}$ to $\\\\rm\\n0.1~M_{\\\\odot}~\\\\rm yr^{-1}$, over a duration of $20$ yrs. For accretion rates\\n$\\\\rm \\\\lesssim 0.01~M_{\\\\odot}~\\\\rm yr^{-1}$ the star remains on the hotter side\\nof the HR diagram with a minor increase in luminosity without expanding, as the\\naccretion timescale exceeds the thermal time scale by a larger factor. Mass\\nloss through stellar winds leads to a minor drop in luminosity shortly after\\nthe accretion phase as the star enters the recovery phase. For $\\\\rm \\\\gtrsim\\n0.01~M_{\\\\odot}~\\\\rm yr^{-1}$ the companion star experiences a sudden increase in\\nluminosity by about one order of magnitude, inflates, and cools. Under the\\naccreted gas layer the star retains its structure and continues to eject\\nradiation-driven wind during the recovery phase, namely the time it takes to\\nregain equilibrium. Eventually, the accreted material mixes with the inner\\nlayers of the star, and the star continues to evolve as a more massive star.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:14:36Z\"}"}
