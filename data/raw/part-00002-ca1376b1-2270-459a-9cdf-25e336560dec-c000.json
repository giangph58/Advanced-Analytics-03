The\\nrefrigerator exhibits the feature of transient cooling, i.e., lowering of the\\ntemperature of the first qubit in sufficiently small timescales. Since the\\nspin-star environment is inherently non-Markovian in nature, steady-state\\ncooling may or may not be achieved. A key advantage of our model is that the\\nsymmetries of the Hamiltonian enable a solution of the reduced density matrices\\nof the refrigerator qubits, even in the presence of a large number (~50) of\\nenvironmental spins. We derive the condition for autonomous refrigeration and\\nanalyze how the optimal cold qubit temperature scales with the number of bath\\nqubits. We find a power law scaling towards a constant asymptotic value. We\\nalso find the scaling of the minimum time required for cooling as a function of\\nthe number of bath spins. Further, we scrutinize the heat currents associated\\nwith each of the three qubits.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T12:53:05Z\"}"}
