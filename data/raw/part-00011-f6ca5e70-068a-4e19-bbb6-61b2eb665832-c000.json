Its impact and emergence in the field of\\nelastodynamic metamaterials is not as well understood however, given the\\ncoupling between compressional and shear waves. Here we discuss the emergence\\nof Willis coupling in heterogeneous elastic slabs embedded in an acoustic\\nfluid. The microstructure of the slab comprises circular cylindrical voids and\\nasymmetry is present via two neighbouring line arrays, each with a repeating\\nvoid of differing radius. The slab matrix is soft, with Poisson ratio close to\\n$1/2$ so that the voids act as Giant Monopole Resonators, and induce a strong\\ndynamic response at low frequency. The incorporation of Willis constitutive\\ncoupling ensures that a unique set of effective material properties can be\\nassigned to the slab up to a maximum frequency defined by the periodic spacing\\nof the voids and the elastic properties of the substrate. Including loss in the\\nelastic medium via its shear modulus induces strong directional-dependent\\nabsorption at low frequency, whilst of course maintaining reciprocity.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:33:05Z\"}"}
