{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20442v1\", \"title\": \"Multidimensional precipitation index prediction based on CNN-LSTM hybrid\\n  framework\", \"summary\": \"With the intensification of global climate change, accurate prediction of\\nweather indicators is of great significance in disaster prevention and\\nmitigation, agricultural production, and transportation. Precipitation, as one\\nof the key meteorological indicators, plays a crucial role in water resource\\nmanagement, agricultural production, and urban flood control. This study\\nproposes a multidimensional precipitation index prediction model based on a\\nCNN- LSTM hybrid framework, aiming to improve the accuracy of precipitation\\nforecasts. The dataset is sourced from Pune, Maharashtra, India, covering\\nmonthly mean precipitation data from 1972 to 2002. This dataset includes nearly\\n31 years (1972-2002) of monthly average precipitation, reflecting the long-term\\nfluctuations and seasonal variations of precipitation in the region. By\\nanalyzing these time series data, the CNN-LSTM model effectively captures local\\nfeatures and long-term dependencies. Experimental results show that the model\\nachieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.752, which demonstrates a\\nsignificant advantage over traditional time series prediction methods in terms\\nof prediction accuracy and generalization ability. Furthermore, this study\\nprovides new research ideas for precipitation prediction. However, the model\\nrequires high computational resources when dealing with large-scale datasets,\\nand its predictive ability for multidimensional precipitation data still needs\\nimprovement. Future research could extend the model to support and predict\\nmultidimensional precipitation data, thereby promoting the development of more\\naccurate and efficient meteorological prediction technologies.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T05:32:43Z\"}"}
