We prove that capacities of such channels are\\napproximately strongly additive and can be efficiently approximated in terms of\\nthe structure of their peripheral spaces. Furthermore, the quantum and private\\nclassical capacities of such channels approximately coincide and approximately\\nsatisfy the strong converse property. We show that these approximate results\\nbecome exact for the corresponding zero-error capacities when $l \\\\geq d^2$. To\\nprove these results, we show that for any channel $\\\\Psi$, the classical,\\nprivate classical, and quantum capacities of $\\\\Psi_\\\\infty$, which is its\\nso-called asymptotic part, satisfy the strong converse property and are\\nstrongly additive. In the zero-error case, we introduce the notion of the\\nstabilized non-commutative confusability graph of a quantum channel and\\ncharacterize its structure for any given channel.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:27:43Z\"}"}
