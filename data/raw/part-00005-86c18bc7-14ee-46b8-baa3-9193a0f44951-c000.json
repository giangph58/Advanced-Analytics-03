However, extracting phonon-mode-resolved insights\\nfrom these simulations remains a critical challenge. Here, we introduce PYSED,\\na Python-based package built on the spectral energy density (SED) method,\\ndesigned to efficiently compute kinetic-energy-weighted phonon dispersion and\\nextract phonon lifetime from large-scale MD simulation trajectories. By\\nintegrating high-accuracy machine-learned neuroevolution potential (NEP)\\nmodels, we validate and showcase the effectiveness of the implemented SED\\nmethod across systems of varying dimensionalities. Specifically, the NEP-driven\\nMD-SED accurately reveals how phonon modes are affected by strain in carbon\\nnanotubes, as well as by interlayer coupling strength and twist angle in\\ntwo-dimensional molybdenum disulfide. For three-dimensional systems, the SED\\nmethod effectively establishes the thermal transport regime diagram for\\nmetal-organic frameworks, distinguishing between particlelike and wavelike\\npropagation regions. Moreover, using bulk silicon as an example, we show that\\nphonon SED can efficiently capture quantum dynamics based on path-integral\\ntrajectories. The PYSED package bridges MD simulations with detailed\\nphonon-mode insights, delivering a robust tool for investigating thermal\\ntransport properties with detailed mechanisms across various materials.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T06:52:18Z\"}"}
