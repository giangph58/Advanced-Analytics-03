Inspired by contraction theory, a\\nneural network-dirven CCM synthesis is adopted to obtain a feedback controller\\nthat could track any feasible trajectory. Based on the observation that the\\nsystem states under continuous control input inherently contain embedded\\ninformation about unknown external disturbances, we propose an online learning\\nscheme that captures the disturbances dyanmics from online historical data and\\nembeds the compensation within the CCM controller. The proposed scheme operates\\nas a plug-and-play module that intrinsically enhances the tracking performance\\nof CCM synthesis. The numerical simulations on tethered space robot and PVTOL\\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of proposed scheme. The source code of the\\nproposed online learning scheme can be found at\\nhttps://github.com/NPU-RCIR/Online_CCM.git.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T08:14:39Z\"}"}
