We prove that the Ramsey number\\n$r(K_4^-, S_n)$ has order of magnitude $n^2 /\\\\log n$.\\n  This confirms a conjecture of Conlon, Fox, He, Suk, Verstra\\\\\\\"ete and the\\nfirst author. It also generalizes the well-known bound of Kim for the graph\\nRamsey number $r(3,n)$, as the link of any vertex in a $K_4^-$-free triple\\nsystem is a triangle-free graph. Our method builds on the approach of Guo and\\nWarnke who adapted Kim's lower bound for $r(3,n)$ to the pseudorandom setting.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:15:43Z\"}"}
