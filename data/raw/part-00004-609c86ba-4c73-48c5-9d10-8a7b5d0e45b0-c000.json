In this article, we study random walks\\nwith resetting on hypergraph by utilizing\\n  spectral theory. Specifically, we derive exact expressions for some\\nfundamental yet key parameters, including occupation\\n  probability, stationary distribution, and mean first passage time, all of\\nwhich are expressed in terms of the eigenvalues\\n  and eigenvectors of the transition matrix. Furthermore, we provide a general\\ncondition for determining the optimal\\n  reset probability and a sufficient condition for its existence. In addition,\\nwe build up a close relationship between\\n  random walks with resetting on hypergraph and simple random walks.\\nConcretely, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors\\n  of the former can be precisely represented by those of the latter. More\\nimportantly, when considering random walks,\\n  we abandon the traditional approach of converting hypergraph into a graph and\\npropose a research framework that\\n  preserves the intrinsic structure of hypergraph itself, which is based on\\nassigning proper weights to neighboring nodes.\\n  Through extensive experiments, we show that the new framework produces\\ndistinct and more reliable results than\\n  the traditional approach in node ranking. Finally, we explore the impact of\\nthe resetting mechanism on cover time,\\n  providing a potential solution for optimizing search efficiency.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SI\", \"categories\": \"cs.SI,physics.data-an\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:09:16Z\"}"}
