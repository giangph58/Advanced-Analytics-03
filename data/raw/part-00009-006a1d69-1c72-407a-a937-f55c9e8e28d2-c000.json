For a given explicit\\nCauchy stress-strain constitutive equation, we determine those properties that\\npertain to the appearing fourth-order stiffness tensor. Notably, we show that\\nthis stiffness tensor $\\\\mathbb{H}^{\\\\text{ZJ}}(\\\\sigma)$ acting on the\\nZaremba-Jaumann stress rate is uniformly positive definite. We suggest a\\nmathematical treatment of the ensuing spatial PDE-system which may ultimately\\nlead to a local existence result, to be presented in part II of this work. As a\\npreparatory step, we show existence and uniqueness of a subproblem based on\\nKorn's first inequality and the positive definiteness of this stiffness tensor.\\nThe procedure is not confined to Cauchy elasticity, however in the Cauchy\\nelastic case, most theoretical statements can be made explicit.\\n  Our development suggests that looking at the rate-form equations of given\\nCauchy-elastic models may provide additional insight to the modeling of\\nnonlinear isotropic elasticity. This especially concerns constitutive\\nrequirements emanating from the rate-formulation, here being reflected by the\\npositive definiteness of $\\\\mathbb{H}^{\\\\text{ZJ}}(\\\\sigma)$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:02:59Z\"}"}
