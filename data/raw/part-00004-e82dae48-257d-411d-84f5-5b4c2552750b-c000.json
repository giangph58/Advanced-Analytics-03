{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00512v1\", \"title\": \"InterLoc: LiDAR-based Intersection Localization using Road Segmentation\\n  with Automated Evaluation Method\", \"summary\": \"Intersections are geometric and functional key points in every road network.\\nThey offer strong landmarks to correct GNSS dropouts and anchor new sensor data\\nin up-to-date maps. Despite that importance, intersection detectors either\\nignore the rich semantic information already computed onboard or depend on\\nscarce, hand-labeled intersection datasets. To close that gap, this paper\\npresents a LiDAR-based method for intersection detection that (i) fuses\\nsemantic road segmentation with vehicle localization to detect intersection\\ncandidates in a bird's eye view (BEV) representation and (ii) refines those\\ncandidates by analyzing branch topology with a least squares formulation. To\\nevaluate our method, we introduce an automated benchmarking pipeline that pairs\\ndetections with OpenStreetMap (OSM) intersection nodes using precise GNSS/INS\\nground-truth poses. Tested on eight SemanticKITTI sequences, the approach\\nachieves a mean localization error of 1.9 m, 89% precision, and 77% recall at a\\n5 m tolerance, outperforming the latest learning-based baseline. Moreover, the\\nmethod is robust to segmentation errors higher than those of the benchmark\\nmodel, demonstrating its applicability in the real world.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T13:30:28Z\"}"}
