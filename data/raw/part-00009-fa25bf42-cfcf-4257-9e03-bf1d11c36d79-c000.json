However,\\nassessing children's development during free play poses significant challenges\\ndue to the unstructured and spontaneous nature of the activity. Traditional\\nassessment methods often rely on direct observations by teachers, parents, or\\nresearchers, which may fail to capture comprehensive insights from free play\\nand provide timely feedback to educators. This study proposes an innovative\\napproach combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with learning analytics to\\nanalyze children's self-narratives of their play experiences. The LLM\\nidentifies developmental abilities, while performance scores across different\\nplay settings are calculated using learning analytics techniques. We collected\\n2,224 play narratives from 29 children in a kindergarten, covering four\\ndistinct play areas over one semester. According to the evaluation results from\\neight professionals, the LLM-based approach achieved high accuracy in\\nidentifying cognitive, motor, and social abilities, with accuracy exceeding 90%\\nin most domains. Moreover, significant differences in developmental outcomes\\nwere observed across play settings, highlighting each area's unique\\ncontributions to specific abilities. These findings confirm that the proposed\\napproach is effective in identifying children's development across various free\\nplay settings. This study demonstrates the potential of integrating LLMs and\\nlearning analytics to provide child-centered insights into developmental\\ntrajectories, offering educators valuable data to support personalized learning\\nand enhance early childhood education practices.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T09:40:47Z\"}"}
