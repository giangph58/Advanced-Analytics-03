Cross-matching celestial catalogs is just one example of this. To\\nchallenge this, we present a framework that enables efficient cross-matching\\nusing Learned Index Structures. Our approach involves a data transformation\\nmethod to map multi-dimensional data into easily learnable distributions,\\ncoupled with a novel search algorithm that leverages the advantages of model\\npairs, significantly enhancing the efficiency of nearest-neighbor search. In\\nthis study, we utilized celestial catalog data derived from astronomical\\nsurveys to construct the index and evaluated the speed of the cross-matching\\nprocess. Using the HEALPix segmentation scheme, we built an independent model\\nobject for each tile and developed an end-to-end pipeline to construct a\\nframework with semantic guarantees for record retrieval in query and range\\nsearch. Our results show that the proposed method improves cross-matching speed\\nby more than four times compared to KD-trees for a radius range between 1\\nmilli-arcseconds and 100 arcseconds.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T07:19:15Z\"}"}
