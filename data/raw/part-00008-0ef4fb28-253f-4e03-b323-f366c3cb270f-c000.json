{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09982v1\", \"title\": \"The gravitational index of a small black ring\", \"summary\": \"Certain supersymmetric elementary string states with angular momentum can be\\nviewed as small black rings in a five-dimensional string theory. These black\\nrings have zero area event horizon. The 4D-5D connection relates these small\\nrings to small black holes without angular momentum in one less dimension.\\nRecent works have proposed saddle solutions that compute the supersymmetric\\nindex for small black holes using gravitational path integral. In this paper,\\nwe propose an analogous saddle solution for a five-dimensional small black\\nring. The dominant contribution comes from a black ring saddle that rotates in\\nboth independent planes in five dimensions and has a finite area event horizon.\\nWe also write the saddle solution as a three-center Bena-Warner solution.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T08:51:19Z\"}"}
