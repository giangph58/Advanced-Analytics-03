The aim of this paper is to study the co-maximal hypergraph of dihedral\\ngroups, $Co_\\\\mathcal{H}(D_n)$. We examine some of the structural properties,\\nviz., diameter, girth and chromatic number of $Co_\\\\mathcal{H}(D_n)$. Also, we\\nprovide characterizations for hypertrees, star structures and 3-uniform\\nhypergraphs of $Co_\\\\mathcal{H}(D_n)$. Further, we discuss the possibilities of\\n$Co_\\\\mathcal{H}(D_n)$ which can be embedded on the plane, torus and projective\\nplane.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T11:52:39Z\"}"}
