Multidimensional continued fractions are a\\ngeneralization of classical continued fractions, introduced by Jacobi, and\\nthere are many well-studied open problems related to them. In this paper, we\\nestablish transcendence criteria for multidimensional continued fractions. In\\nparticular, we show that some Liouville-type and quasi-periodic\\nmultidimensional continued fractions are transcendental. We also obtain an\\nupper bound on the naive height of cubic irrationals arising from periodic\\nmultidimensional continued fractions and exploit it to prove the transcendence\\ncriteria in the quasi-periodic case.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T10:06:25Z\"}"}
