One problem is to understand the collection of points $S$ in an\\nattracting basin whose forward orbits land exactly on the attracting fixed\\npoint. In the paper [13], the second author showed that for holomorphic\\npolynomials in $\\\\mathbb C$, there is a constant $C$ so that all Kobayashi discs\\nof radius $C$ must intersect this set $S$. In the paper [15], the second author\\nshowed that there are holomorphic skew products in $\\\\mathbb {C}^2$ where this\\nresult fails. The main result of this paper is to show that for a large class\\nof polynomial skew products, this result nevertheless holds.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T13:09:48Z\"}"}
