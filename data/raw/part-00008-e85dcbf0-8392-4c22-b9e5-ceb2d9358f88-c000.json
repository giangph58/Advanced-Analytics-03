{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06263v1\", \"title\": \"OmniSVG: A Unified Scalable Vector Graphics Generation Model\", \"summary\": \"Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an important image format widely adopted in\\ngraphic design because of their resolution independence and editability. The\\nstudy of generating high-quality SVG has continuously drawn attention from both\\ndesigners and researchers in the AIGC community. However, existing methods\\neither produces unstructured outputs with huge computational cost or is limited\\nto generating monochrome icons of over-simplified structures. To produce\\nhigh-quality and complex SVG, we propose OmniSVG, a unified framework that\\nleverages pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for end-to-end multimodal\\nSVG generation. By parameterizing SVG commands and coordinates into discrete\\ntokens, OmniSVG decouples structural logic from low-level geometry for\\nefficient training while maintaining the expressiveness of complex SVG\\nstructure. To further advance the development of SVG synthesis, we introduce\\nMMSVG-2M, a multimodal dataset with two million richly annotated SVG assets,\\nalong with a standardized evaluation protocol for conditional SVG generation\\ntasks. Extensive experiments show that OmniSVG outperforms existing methods and\\ndemonstrates its potential for integration into professional SVG design\\nworkflows.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T17:59:49Z\"}"}
