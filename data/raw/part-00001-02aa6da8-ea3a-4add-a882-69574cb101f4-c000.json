We formulate STL constraints as a robust optimization problem (ROP)\\nand recast it as a scenario optimization program (SOP) to construct STTs with\\nformal correctness guarantees. We also propose a closed-form control law that\\noperates independently of the system dynamics, and ensures the system\\ntrajectory evolves within the STTs, thereby satisfying the STL specifications.\\nThe proposed approach is validated through case studies and comparisons with\\nstate-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior computational efficiency,\\ntrajectory quality, and applicability to complex STL tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:08:47Z\"}"}
