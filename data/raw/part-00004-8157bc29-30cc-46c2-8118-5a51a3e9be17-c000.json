{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01488v1\", \"title\": \"A Novel Pilot Allocation Technique for Uplink OFDMA in ISAC Systems\", \"summary\": \"In integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, pilot signals play a\\ncrucial role in enhancing sensing performance due to their strong\\nautocorrelation properties and high transmission power. However, conventional\\ninterleaved pilots inherently constrain the maximum unambiguous range and\\nreduce the accuracy of channel impulse response (CIR) estimation compared to\\ncontinuous orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) signals. To\\naddress this challenge, we propose a novel overlapped block-pilot structure for\\nuplink OFDMA-based ISAC systems, called phase-shifted ISAC (PS-ISAC) pilot\\nallocation. The proposed method leverages a cyclic prefix (CP)-based\\nphase-shifted pilot design, enabling efficient multi-transmitter pilot\\nseparation at the receiver. Simulation results confirm that the proposed scheme\\nenhances CIR separation, reduces computational complexity, and improves mean\\nsquare error (MSE) performance under practical power constraints. Furthermore,\\nwe demonstrate that utilizing continuous pilot resources maximizes the\\nunambiguous range.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:39:28Z\"}"}
