However, it tends to suffer from a high false\\nnegative rate due to the inherent incompleteness. To address this issue, we\\npresent a novel approach called \\\\textbf{C}onstraint \\\\textbf{M}ulti-class\\n\\\\textbf{P}ositive and \\\\textbf{U}nlabeled Learning (CMPU), which introduces a\\nconstraint factor on the risk estimator of multiple positive classes. It\\nsuggests that the constraint non-negative risk estimator is more robust against\\noverfitting than previous PU learning methods with limited positive data. Solid\\ntheoretical analysis on CMPU is provided to prove the validity of our approach.\\nExtensive experiments on two benchmark datasets that were labeled using diverse\\nexternal knowledge sources serve to demonstrate the superior performance of\\nCMPU in comparison to existing DS-NER methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:51:41Z\"}"}
