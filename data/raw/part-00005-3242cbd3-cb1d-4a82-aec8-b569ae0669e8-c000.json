{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16550v1\", \"title\": \"A Collaborative Intrusion Detection System Using Snort IDS Nodes\", \"summary\": \"Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are integral to safeguarding networks by\\ndetecting and responding to threats from malicious traffic or compromised\\ndevices. However, standalone IDS deployments often fall short when addressing\\nthe increasing complexity and scale of modern cyberattacks. This paper proposes\\na Collaborative Intrusion Detection System (CIDS) that leverages Snort, an\\nopen-source network intrusion detection system, to enhance detection accuracy\\nand reduce false positives. The proposed architecture connects multiple Snort\\nIDS nodes to a centralised node and integrates with a Security Information and\\nEvent Management (SIEM) platform to facilitate real-time data sharing,\\ncorrelation, and analysis. The CIDS design includes a scalable configuration of\\nSnort sensors, a centralised database for log storage, and LogScale SIEM for\\nadvanced analytics and visualisation. By aggregating and analysing intrusion\\ndata from multiple nodes, the system enables improved detection of distributed\\nand sophisticated attack patterns that standalone IDSs may miss. Performance\\nevaluation against simulated attacks, including Nmap port scans and ICMP flood\\nattacks, demonstrates our CIDS's ability to efficiently process large-scale\\nnetwork traffic, detect threats with higher accuracy, and reduce alert fatigue.\\nThis paper highlights the potential of CIDS in modern network environments and\\nexplores future enhancements, such as integrating machine learning for advanced\\nthreat detection and creating public datasets to support collaborative\\nresearch. The proposed CIDS framework provides a promising foundation for\\nbuilding more resilient and adaptive network security systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T09:25:52Z\"}"}
