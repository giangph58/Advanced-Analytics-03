Optical absorption in the test masses leads\\nto thermal effects that shift the eigenmodes of the optical cavities, and cause\\ncontrol issues such as parametric instabilities.\\n  Here we experimentally validate a novel technique using optical injection to\\nmeasure the mode amplitudes within an optical resonator. We use a phase camera,\\nsimilar to the ones installed at gravitational-wave detectors, in transmission\\nof the cavity, to confirm the mode basis and image modes up to order 10. We\\nshowcase as well the capability of the phase camera to determine the optical\\nphase between the carrier fundamental mode and other co-resonating higher-order\\nmodes, which can be used for optical suppression of parametric instabilities\\nand automatic mode matching.\\n  These results highlight the relevance of implementing a similar scheme in\\ncurrent GW detectors to monitor thermal effects.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T13:36:39Z\"}"}
