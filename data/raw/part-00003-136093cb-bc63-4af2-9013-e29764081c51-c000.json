{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15591v1\", \"title\": \"Reconciling the Waiting Time Peaks Variations of Repeating FRBs with an\\n  Eccentric Neutron Star--White Dwarf Binary\", \"summary\": \"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are luminous radio transients with millisecond\\nduration. For some active repeaters, such as FRBs 20121102A and 20201124A, more\\nthan a thousand bursts have been detected by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture\\nSpherical radio Telescope (FAST). The waiting time (WT) distributions of both\\nrepeaters, defined as the time intervals between adjacent (detected) bursts,\\nexhibit a bimodal structure well-fitted by two log-normal functions. Notably,\\nthe time scales of the long-duration WT peaks for both repeaters show a\\ndecreasing trend over time. These similar burst features suggest that there may\\nbe a common physical mechanism for FRBs~20121102A and 20201124A. In this paper,\\nwe {revisit} the neutron star (NS)--white dwarf (WD) binary model with an\\neccentric orbit to account for the observed changes in the long-duration WT\\npeaks. According to our model, the shortening of the WT peaks corresponds to\\nthe orbital period decay of the NS-WD binary. We consider two mass transfer\\nmodes, namely, stable and unstable mass transfer, to examine how the orbital\\nperiod evolves. Our findings reveal distinct evolutionary pathways for the two\\nrepeaters: for FRB~20121102A, the NS-WD binary likely undergoes a combination\\nof common envelope (CE) ejection and Roche lobe overflow, whereas for\\nFRB~20201124A the system may experience multiple CE ejections. These findings\\nwarrant further validation through follow-up observations.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T05:13:34Z\"}"}
