For this type of curve data sets, the present paper solves the problem\\nof local linear approximation of the Fr\\\\'echet conditional mean in an extrinsic\\nand intrinsic way. The extrinsic local linear Fr\\\\'echet functional regression\\npredictor is obtained in the time varying tangent space by projection into an\\northornormal basis of the ambient Hilbert space. The conditions assumed ensure\\nthe existence and uniqueness of this predictor, and its computation via\\nexponential and logarithmic maps. A weighted Fr\\\\'echet mean approach is adopted\\nin the computation of an intrinsic local linear Fr\\\\'echet functional regression\\npredictor. The asymptotic optimality of this intrinsic local approximation is\\nalso proved. The performance of the empirical version of both, extrinsic and\\nintrinsic functional predictors, and of a Nadaraya-Watson type Fr\\\\'echet curve\\npredictor is illustrated in the simulation study undertaken. The finite-sample\\nsize properties are also tested in a real-data application via\\ncross-validation. Specifically, functional prediction of the magnetic vector\\nfield from the time-varying geocentric latitude and longitude of the satellite\\nNASA's MAGSAT spacecraft is addressed.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,cs.LG,stat.ML,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T12:06:59Z\"}"}
