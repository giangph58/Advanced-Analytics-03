{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23818v1\", \"title\": \"Free Parametrization of L2-bounded State Space Models\", \"summary\": \"Structured state-space models (SSMs) have emerged as a powerful architecture\\nin machine learning and control, featuring stacked layers where each consists\\nof a linear time-invariant (LTI) discrete-time system followed by a\\nnonlinearity. While SSMs offer computational efficiency and excel in\\nlong-sequence predictions, their widespread adoption in applications like\\nsystem identification and optimal control is hindered by the challenge of\\nensuring their stability and robustness properties. We introduce L2RU, a novel\\nparametrization of SSMs that guarantees input-output stability and robustness\\nby enforcing a prescribed L-bound for all parameter values. This design\\neliminates the need for complex constraints, allowing unconstrained\\noptimization over L2RUs by using standard methods such as gradient descent.\\nLeveraging tools from system theory and convex optimization, we derive a\\nnon-conservative parametrization of square discrete-time LTI systems with a\\nspecified L2-bound, forming the foundation of the L2RU architecture.\\nAdditionally, we enhance its performance with a bespoke initialization strategy\\noptimized for long input sequences. Through a system identification task, we\\nvalidate L2RU's superior performance, showcasing its potential in learning and\\ncontrol applications.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.LG,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T07:56:17Z\"}"}
