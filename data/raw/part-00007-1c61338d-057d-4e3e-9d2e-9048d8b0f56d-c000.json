{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21653v1\", \"title\": \"Path Extendable Tournaments\", \"summary\": \"A digraph $D$ is called \\\\emph{path extendable} if for every nonhamiltonian\\n(directed) path $P$ in $D$, there exists another path $P^\\\\prime$ with the same\\ninitial and terminal vertices as $P$, and $V(P^\\\\prime) = V (P)\\\\cup \\\\{w\\\\}$ for a\\nvertex $w \\\\in V(D)\\\\setminus V(P)$. Hence, path extendability implies paths of\\ncontinuous lengths between every vertex pair. In earlier works of C. Thomassen\\nand K. Zhang, it was shown that the condition of small $i(T)$ or positive\\n$\\\\pi_2(T)$ implies paths of continuous lengths between every vertex pair in a\\ntournament $T$, where $i(T)$ is the irregularity of $T$ and $\\\\pi_2(T)$ denotes\\nfor the minimum number of paths of length $2$ from $u$ to $v$ among all vertex\\npairs $\\\\{u,v\\\\}$. Motivated by these results, we study sufficient conditions in\\nterms of $i(T)$ and $\\\\pi_2(T)$ that guarantee a tournament $T$ is path\\nextendable. We prove that (1) a tournament $T$ is path extendable if $i(T)<\\n2\\\\pi_2(T)-(|T|+8)/6$, and (2) a tournament $T$ is path extendable if $\\\\pi_2(T)\\n> (7|T|-10)/36$. As an application, we deduce that almost all random\\ntournaments are path extendable.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,G.2.2\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T13:56:24Z\"}"}
