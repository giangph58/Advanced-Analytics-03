One limitation of GAN-based image\\ngeneration is the difficulty of controlling the features of the generated\\nimage, due to the strong entanglement of the low-dimensional latent space.\\nPrevious work that aimed to control StyleGAN with image or text prompts\\nmodulated sampling in W latent space, which is more expressive than Z latent\\nspace. However, W space still has restricted expressivity since it does not\\ncontrol the feature synthesis directly; also the feature embedding in W space\\nrequires a pre-training process to reconstruct the style signal, limiting its\\napplication. This paper introduces the concept of \\\"generative fields\\\" to\\nexplain the hierarchical feature synthesis in StyleGAN, inspired by the\\nreceptive fields of convolution neural networks (CNNs). Additionally, we\\npropose a new image editing pipeline for StyleGAN using generative field theory\\nand the channel-wise style latent space S, utilizing the intrinsic structural\\nfeature of CNNs to achieve disentangled control of feature synthesis at\\nsynthesis time.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T16:15:02Z\"}"}
