{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05405v1\", \"title\": \"Testing an unstable cosmic neutrino background\", \"summary\": \"I discuss how different cosmological observations can test the possibility\\nthat neutrinos might be unstable on cosmological times, resulting into an\\nunstable cosmic neutrino background. I also discuss out how actually there are\\ndifferent independent anomalies intriguingly hint to such a possibility that\\nwould clearly point to new physics. I first focus on how the new DESI results\\nplace an upper bound on the sum of neutrino masses that starts to be in tension\\nwith the lower bound from neutrino oscillation experiments and how this tension\\ncould be easily solved assuming unstable relic neutrinos. Then I show how 21 cm\\ncosmology allows to test radiative relic neutrino decays and how these could\\nexplain the controversial EDGES anomaly. I also discuss how the excess radio\\nbackground and in particular the ARCADE 2 data can also be nicely explained by\\nrelic neutrino radiative decays. Finally, I point out the difficulties in\\nbuilding a model that does not clash with the upper limits on the effective\\nmagnetic moment coming from neutrino-electron scattering experiments and\\nglobular cluster stars.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T16:46:13Z\"}"}
