The proposed approach\\nexploits oblique rotation manifolds, rewrite the problem, and introduce a new\\nRiemannian optimization method. Experiments on synthetic datasets compared to\\nthe standard Euclidean method show the effectiveness of the proposed method.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:31:05Z\"}"}
