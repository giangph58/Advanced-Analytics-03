ADAM employs\\ncutting-edge AI architectures to reshape scientific workflows through a modular\\ndesign. It adopts a hybrid neural-symbolic architecture that combines\\nLLM-driven semantic tools with deterministic symbolic computations. Moreover,\\nits ADAM Tool Protocol (ATP) enables asynchronous, database-centric tool\\norchestration, fostering community-driven extensibility. Despite the\\nsignificant progress made, ongoing challenges call for further efforts in\\nestablishing benchmarking standards, optimizing foundational models and agents,\\nand building an open collaborative ecosystem.
