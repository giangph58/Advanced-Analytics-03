This challenge received a wide range of impressive\\nsolutions, which are developed and evaluated using our collected real-world\\nRaindrop Clarity dataset. Unlike existing deraining datasets, our Raindrop\\nClarity dataset is more diverse and challenging in degradation types and\\ncontents, which includes day raindrop-focused, day background-focused, night\\nraindrop-focused, and night background-focused degradations. This dataset is\\ndivided into three subsets for competition: 14,139 images for training, 240\\nimages for validation, and 731 images for testing. The primary objective of\\nthis challenge is to establish a new and powerful benchmark for the task of\\nremoving raindrops under varying lighting and focus conditions. There are a\\ntotal of 361 participants in the competition, and 32 teams submitting valid\\nsolutions and fact sheets for the final testing phase. These submissions\\nachieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the Raindrop Clarity dataset.\\nThe project can be found at\\nhttps://lixinustc.github.io/CVPR-NTIRE2025-RainDrop-Competition.github.io/.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI,eess.IV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T07:35:35Z\"}"}
