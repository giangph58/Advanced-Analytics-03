Because of the absence of\\nfixed lattice structure, RCTN is not expected to have renormalization\\nprocedures. In this paper, however, we consider RCTN with a real tensor, and it\\nis proven that a Hamiltonian vector flow of a tensor model in the canonical\\nformalism with a positive cosmological constant has the properties which a\\nrenormalization group (RG) flow of RCTN would have: The flow has fixed points\\non phase transition surfaces; every flow line is asymptotically terminated by\\nfixed points at both ends, where an upstream fixed point has higher criticality\\nthan a downstream one; the flow goes along phase transition surfaces; there\\nexists a function which monotonically decreases along the flow, analogously to\\nthe $a$- and $c$-functions of RG. A complete classification of fixed points is\\ngiven. Although there are no cyclic flows in the strict sense, these exist, if\\ninfinitesimal jumps are allowed near fixed points.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T09:30:04Z\"}"}
