We examine a specific type of curve evolution, known as the\\nLund-Regge evolution, and derive its representation in the Frenet frame. We\\nshow the Frenet frame evolution aligns with the Lax system of the PLR equation\\nand develop a construction method for curve families via the Sym formula. In\\nconclusion, we describe the Lund-Regge evolution corresponding to Date's\\nmulti-soliton solutions to the PLR equation, with illustrations of curves and\\nsurfaces.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG,nlin.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T07:07:32Z\"}"}
