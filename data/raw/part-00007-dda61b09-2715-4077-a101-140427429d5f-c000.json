{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07453v1\", \"title\": \"Probability Estimation and Scheduling Optimization for Battery Swap\\n  Stations via LRU-Enhanced Genetic Algorithm and Dual-Factor Decision System\", \"summary\": \"To address the challenges of limited Battery Swap Stations datasets, high\\noperational costs, and fluctuating user charging demand, this research proposes\\na probability estimation model based on charging pile data and constructs nine\\nscenario-specific battery swap demand datasets. In addition, this study\\ncombines Least Recently Used strategy with Genetic Algorithm and incorporates a\\nguided search mechanism, which effectively enhances the global optimization\\ncapability. Thus, a dual-factor decision-making based charging schedule\\noptimization system is constructed. Experimental results show that the\\nconstructed datasets exhibit stable trend characteristics, adhering to 24-hour\\nand 168-hour periodicity patterns, with outlier ratios consistently below\\n3.26%, confirming data validity. Compared to baseline, the improved algorithm\\nachieves better fitness individuals in 80% of test regions under the same\\niterations. When benchmarked against immediate swap-and-charge strategy, our\\nalgorithm achieves a peak cost reduction of 13.96%. Moreover, peak user\\nsatisfaction reaches 98.57%, while the average iteration time remains below 0.6\\nseconds, demonstrating good computational efficiency. The complete datasets and\\noptimization algorithm are open-sourced at\\nhttps://github.com/qingshufan/GA-EVLRU.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NE\", \"categories\": \"cs.NE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T04:58:24Z\"}"}
