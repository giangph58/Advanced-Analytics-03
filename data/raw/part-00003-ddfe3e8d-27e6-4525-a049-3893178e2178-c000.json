{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16758v1\", \"title\": \"The Interplay of Single Ion Anisotropy and Magnetic 3d-4f Interactions\\n  in V$^{\\\\rm III}_2$Ln$^{\\\\rm III}_2$ Butterfly Complexes\", \"summary\": \"Within the framework of 3d-4f molecular magnets, the most thoroughly\\ninvestigated architecture is that of butterfly-shaped coordination clusters as\\nit provides an ideal testbed to study fundamental magnetic interactions. Here,\\nwe report the synthesis and characterisation of a series of isostructural\\nV$^{\\\\rm III}_2$Ln$^{\\\\rm III}_2$ butterfly complexes, where Ln = Y (1Y), Tb\\n(2Tb), Dy (3Dy), Ho (4Ho), Er (5Er), Tm (6Tm), Yb (7Yb), which extends the\\nprevious study on isostructural butterflies with Cr$^{\\\\rm III}$, Mn$^{\\\\rm III}$\\nand Fe$^{\\\\rm III}$. In zero external field, compounds 2Tb, 3Dy and 4Ho show\\nclear maxima in the out-of-phase component of the ac susceptibility whereas\\nsmall magnetic fields are needed to suppress quantum tunneling in 6Tm. Combined\\nhigh-field electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetisation\\nmeasurements unambiguously reveal an easy-plane anisotropy of the V$^{\\\\rm III}$\\nion and antiferromagnetic Ising-like 3d-4f exchange couplings. The strength of\\n$J_{\\\\rm 3d-4f}$ is shown to decrease upon variation of the 4f ion from Tb to\\nHo, while increasing antiferromagnetic interaction can be observed from Ho to\\nTm. The exact inverse chemical trend is found for the relative angle between\\nthe 3d and 4f main anisotropy axes, which highlights the important role of the\\nlanthanide 4f electron distribution anisotropy for 3d-4f exchange.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T14:32:15Z\"}"}
