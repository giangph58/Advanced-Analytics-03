Our algorithm has sublinear runtime\\nfor dense graphs and achieves a quantum speedup over the best-known classical\\nalgorithm, which runs in $\\\\widetilde{O}(m)$ time. The approach carefully\\ncombines, on one hand, a classical method based on ``large-step'' random walks\\nfor reduced mixing time and, on the other hand, quantum algorithmic techniques,\\nincluding quantum graph sparsification and a sampling-without-replacement\\nvariant of Hamoudi's multiple-state preparation. We also establish a matching\\nlower bound, proving the optimality of our algorithm up to polylogarithmic\\nfactors. These results highlight the potential of quantum computing in\\naccelerating fundamental graph sampling problems.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T05:45:04Z\"}"}
