{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03412v1\", \"title\": \"CXR-AD: Component X-ray Image Dataset for Industrial Anomaly Detection\", \"summary\": \"Internal defect detection constitutes a critical process in ensuring\\ncomponent quality, for which anomaly detection serves as an effective solution.\\nHowever, existing anomaly detection datasets predominantly focus on surface\\ndefects in visible-light images, lacking publicly available X-ray datasets\\ntargeting internal defects in components. To address this gap, we construct the\\nfirst publicly accessible component X-ray anomaly detection (CXR-AD) dataset,\\ncomprising real-world X-ray images. The dataset covers five industrial\\ncomponent categories, including 653 normal samples and 561 defect samples with\\nprecise pixel-level mask annotations. We systematically analyze the dataset\\ncharacteristics and identify three major technical challenges: (1) strong\\ncoupling between complex internal structures and defect regions, (2) inherent\\nlow contrast and high noise interference in X-ray imaging, and (3) significant\\nvariations in defect scales and morphologies. To evaluate dataset complexity,\\nwe benchmark three state-of-the-art anomaly detection frameworks\\n(feature-based, reconstruction-based, and zero-shot learning methods).\\nExperimental results demonstrate a 29.78% average performance degradation on\\nCXR-AD compared to MVTec AD, highlighting the limitations of current algorithms\\nin handling internal defect detection tasks. To the best of our knowledge,\\nCXR-AD represents the first publicly available X-ray dataset for component\\nanomaly detection, providing a real-world industrial benchmark to advance\\nalgorithm development and enhance precision in internal defect inspection\\ntechnologies.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T10:38:24Z\"}"}
