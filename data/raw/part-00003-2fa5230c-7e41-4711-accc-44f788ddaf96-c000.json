In this work,\\nwe first propose a task-agnostic SemCom (TASC) framework that can handle\\ndiverse tasks with multiple modalities. Aiming to explore the interplay between\\ncommunications and intelligent tasks from the information-theoretical\\nperspective, we leverage information bottleneck (IB) theory and propose a\\ndistributed multimodal IB (DMIB) principle to learn minimal and sufficient\\nunimodal and multimodal information effectively by discarding redundancy while\\npreserving task-related information. To further reduce the communication\\noverhead, we develop an adaptive semantic feature transmission method under\\ndynamic channel conditions. Then, TASC is trained based on federated\\nmeta-learning (FML) for rapid adaptation and generalization in wireless\\nnetworks. To gain deep insights, we rigorously conduct theoretical analysis and\\ndevise resource management to accelerate convergence while minimizing the\\ntraining latency and energy consumption. Moreover, we develop a joint user\\nselection and resource allocation algorithm to address the non-convex problem\\nwith theoretical guarantees. Extensive simulation results validate the\\neffectiveness and superiority of the proposed TASC compared to baselines.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T15:09:07Z\"}"}
