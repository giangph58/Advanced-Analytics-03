Moreover, the types of interactions, cooperative or antagonistic, may\\nchange. To model these structural changes, we represent the system as a\\nswitched system interconnected over a dynamic signed graph. Using the signed\\nedge-based agreement protocol and constructing strict Lyapunov functions for\\nsigned edge-Laplacian matrices with multiple zero eigenvalues, we establish\\nglobal asymptotic stability of the bipartite consensus control. Numerical\\nsimulations validate our theoretical results.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T08:58:15Z\"}"}
