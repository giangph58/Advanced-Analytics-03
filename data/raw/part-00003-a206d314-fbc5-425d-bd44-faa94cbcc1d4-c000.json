The wide diversity of items and strict business\\nrequirements for high producing rates and low defect generation have prohibited\\nwarehouse robotics from performing this task. Our innovations in hardware,\\nperception, decision-making, motion planning, and control have enabled this\\nsystem to perform over 500,000 stows in a large e-commerce fulfillment center.\\nThe system achieves human levels of packing density and speed while\\nprioritizing work on overhead shelves to enhance the safety of humans working\\nalongside the robots.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T17:07:09Z\"}"}
