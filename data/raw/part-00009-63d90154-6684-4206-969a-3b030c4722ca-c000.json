{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10453v1\", \"title\": \"Anchors no more: Using peculiar velocities to constrain $H_0$ and the\\n  primordial Universe without calibrators\", \"summary\": \"We develop a novel approach to constrain the Hubble parameter $H_0$ and the\\nprimordial power spectrum amplitude $A_\\\\mathrm{s}$ using supernovae type Ia\\n(SNIa) data. By considering SNIa as tracers of the peculiar velocity field, we\\ncan model their distance and their covariance as a function of cosmological\\nparameters without the need of calibrators like Cepheids; this yields a new\\nindependent probe of the large-scale structure based on SNIa data without\\ndistance anchors. Crucially, we implement a differentiable pipeline in JAX,\\nincluding efficient emulators and affine sampling, reducing inference time from\\nyears to hours on a single GPU. We first validate our method on mock datasets,\\ndemonstrating that we can constrain $H_0$ and $\\\\log 10^{10}A_\\\\mathrm{s}$ within\\n$\\\\sim10\\\\%$ using $\\\\sim10^3$ SNIa. We then test our pipeline with SNIa from an\\n$N$-body simulation, obtaining $7\\\\%$-level unbiased constraints on $H_0$ with a\\nmoderate noise level. We finally apply our method to Pantheon+ data,\\nconstraining $H_0$ at the $10\\\\%$ level without Cepheids when fixing\\n$A_\\\\mathrm{s}$ to its $\\\\it{Planck}$ value. On the other hand, we obtain\\n$15\\\\%$-level constraints on $\\\\log 10^{10}A_\\\\mathrm{s}$ in agreement with\\n$\\\\it{Planck}$ when including Cepheids in the analysis. In light of upcoming\\nobservations of low redshift SNIa from the Zwicky Transient Facility and the\\nVera Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time, surveys for which our method will\\ndevelop its full potential, we make our code publicly available.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.IM,cs.LG,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:40:18Z\"}"}
