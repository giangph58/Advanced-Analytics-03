Existing evaluations are limited by the static\\nassessment that focuses on knowledge tests, the single perspective that centers\\non user experience, and the open-loop framework that lacks actionable feedback.\\nTo address these issues, we propose {\\\\Psi}-Arena, an interactive framework for\\ncomprehensive assessment and optimization of LLM-based counselors, featuring\\nthree key characteristics: (1) Realistic arena interactions that simulate\\nreal-world counseling through multi-stage dialogues with psychologically\\nprofiled NPC clients, (2) Tripartite evaluation that integrates assessments\\nfrom the client, counselor, and supervisor perspectives, and (3) Closed-loop\\noptimization that iteratively improves LLM counselors using diagnostic\\nfeedback. Experiments across eight state-of-the-art LLMs show significant\\nperformance variations in different real-world scenarios and evaluation\\nperspectives. Moreover, reflection-based optimization results in up to a 141%\\nimprovement in counseling performance. We hope PsychoArena provides a\\nfoundational resource for advancing reliable and human-aligned LLM applications\\nin mental healthcare.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:22:51Z\"}"}
