{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12740v1\", \"title\": \"GPMFS: Global Foundation and Personalized Optimization for Multi-Label\\n  Feature Selection\", \"summary\": \"As artificial intelligence methods are increasingly applied to complex task\\nscenarios, high dimensional multi-label learning has emerged as a prominent\\nresearch focus. At present, the curse of dimensionality remains one of the\\nmajor bottlenecks in high-dimensional multi-label learning, which can be\\neffectively addressed through multi-label feature selection methods. However,\\nexisting multi-label feature selection methods mostly focus on identifying\\nglobal features shared across all labels, which overlooks personalized\\ncharacteristics and specific requirements of individual labels. This\\nglobal-only perspective may limit the ability to capture label-specific\\ndiscriminative information, thereby affecting overall performance. In this\\npaper, we propose a novel method called GPMFS (Global Foundation and\\nPersonalized Optimization for Multi-Label Feature Selection). GPMFS firstly\\nidentifies global features by exploiting label correlations, then adaptively\\nsupplements each label with a personalized subset of discriminative features\\nusing a threshold-controlled strategy. Experiments on multiple real-world\\ndatasets demonstrate that GPMFS achieves superior performance while maintaining\\nstrong interpretability and robustness. Furthermore, GPMFS provides insights\\ninto the label-specific strength across different multi-label datasets, thereby\\ndemonstrating the necessity and potential applicability of personalized feature\\nselection approaches.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T08:29:14Z\"}"}
