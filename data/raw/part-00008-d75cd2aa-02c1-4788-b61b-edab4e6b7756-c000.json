However, SDS-based methods struggle to maintain\\nsemantic fidelity for user prompts, particularly when involving multiple\\nobjects with intricate interactions. While existing approaches often address 3D\\nconsistency through multiview diffusion model fine-tuning on 3D datasets, this\\nstrategy inadvertently exacerbates text-3D alignment degradation. The\\nlimitation stems from SDS's inherent accumulation of view-independent biases\\nduring optimization, which progressively diverges from the ideal text alignment\\ndirection. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel SDS objective,\\ndubbed as Textual Coherent Score Distillation (TCSD), which integrates\\nalignment feedback from multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our TCSD\\nleverages cross-modal understanding capabilities of MLLMs to assess and guide\\nthe text-3D correspondence during the optimization. We further develop\\n3DLLaVA-CRITIC - a fine-tuned MLLM specialized for evaluating multiview text\\nalignment in 3D generations. Additionally, we introduce an LLM-layout\\ninitialization that significantly accelerates optimization convergence through\\nsemantic-aware spatial configuration. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate\\nthat our framework, CoherenDream, establishes state-of-the-art performance in\\ntext-aligned 3D generation across multiple benchmarks, including T$^3$Bench and\\nTIFA subset. Qualitative results showcase the superior performance of\\nCoherenDream in preserving textual consistency and semantic interactions. As\\nthe first study to incorporate MLLMs into SDS optimization, we also conduct\\nextensive ablation studies to explore optimal MLLM adaptations for 3D\\ngeneration tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:50:45Z\"}"}
