They enable seamless integration of third-party libraries.\\nHowever, they also introduce security challenges. Transitive vulnerabilities\\nthat arise from indirect dependencies expose projects to risks associated with\\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). It happens even when direct\\ndependencies remain secure. This paper examines the lifecycle of transitive\\nvulnerabilities in the Maven ecosystem. We employ survival analysis to measure\\nthe time projects remain exposed after a CVE is introduced. Using a large\\ndataset of Maven projects, we identify factors that influence the resolution of\\nthese vulnerabilities. Our findings offer practical advice on improving\\ndependency management.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE,cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T07:54:15Z\"}"}
