Here, we\\ndemonstrate almost two-orders-of-magnitude improved precision spectroscopy over\\nthe previous reports by trapping atoms in a three-dimensional magic-wavelength\\noptical lattice. In particular, we successfully observe the coherent Rabi\\noscillation, the relaxation dynamics of the excited state, and the interorbital\\nFeshbach resonance. To highlight the high precision of our spectroscopy, we\\ncarry out precise isotope shift measurements between five stable bosonic\\nisotopes well below 10 Hz uncertainties, successfully setting bounds for a\\nhypothetical boson mediating a force between electrons and neutrons. These\\nresults open up the way for various new physics search experiments and a wide\\nrange of applications to quantum science with this clock transition.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph,hep-ex,hep-ph,nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T06:10:57Z\"}"}
