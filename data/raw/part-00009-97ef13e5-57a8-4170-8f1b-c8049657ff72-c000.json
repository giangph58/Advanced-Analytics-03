Among various technologies, coating the surface of electrodes or\\nelectrolytes has proven to be an effective method to enhance interfacial\\nstability and improve battery cycling performance. Recent experimental studies\\nshowed that gas-solid reactions offer a convenient approach to form modified\\ncoating layers on the solid electrolyte. Here, we performed computational\\nsimulations to investigate this surface reaction process. Specifically, we\\nsimulated the gas-solid reactions of Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl(LPSC) solid-state\\nelectrolytes in pure CO$_2$ and in mixed CO$_2$/O$_2$ atmospheres using\\nab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and machine-learning force fields\\n(MLFF)-accelerated molecular dynamics (MD) approaches. In the former case, LPSC\\nsurfaces primarily form Li$_2$CO$_2$S because it is difficult to dissociate\\nanother oxygen atom from the second CO$_2$ molecule. While in CO$_2$/O$_2$\\nmixed atmosphere, O$_2$ molecules preferentially adsorb onto LPSC, which\\nsupplies oxygen sites for subsequent CO$_2$ adsorption to form carbonate\\n-CO$_3$ units. This reaction pathway ultimately generates an interfacial\\nproduct dominated by Li$_2$CO$_3$. These coatings exhibit distinct electronic\\nand ionic conductivity characteristics, allowing the possibility to control\\ncoating compositions and configurations by adjusting the gas-solid reactions.\\nKey criteria for applying this strategy are extracted from the current\\nresearch.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T04:45:40Z\"}"}
