{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14961v1\", \"title\": \"Mitigating error cancellation in density functional approximations via\\n  machine learning correction\", \"summary\": \"The integration of machine learning (ML) with density functional theory has\\nemerged as a promising strategy to enhance the accuracy of density functional\\nmethods. While practical implementations of density functional approximations\\n(DFAs) often exploit error cancellation between chemical species to achieve\\nhigh accuracy in thermochemical and kinetic energy predictions, this approach\\nis inherently system-dependent, which severely limits the transferability of\\nDFAs. To address this challenge, we develop a novel ML-based correction to the\\nwidely used B3LYP functional, directly targeting its deviations from the exact\\nexchange-correlation functional. By utilizing highly accurate absolute energies\\nas exclusive reference data, our approach eliminates the reliance on error\\ncancellation. To optimize the ML model, we attribute errors to real-space\\npointwise contributions and design a double-cycle protocol that incorporates\\nself-consistent-field calculations into the training workflow. Numerical tests\\ndemonstrate that the ML model, trained solely on absolute energies, improves\\nthe accuracy of calculated relative energies, demonstrating that robust DFAs\\ncan be constructed without resorting to error cancellation. Comprehensive\\nbenchmarks further show that our ML-corrected B3LYP functional significantly\\noutperforms the original B3LYP across diverse thermochemical and kinetic energy\\ncalculations, offering a versatile and superior alternative for practical\\napplications.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T08:40:22Z\"}"}
