{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15042v1\", \"title\": \"Bayesian Sensing for Time-Varying Channels in ISAC Systems\", \"summary\": \"Future mobile networks are projected to support integrated sensing and\\ncommunications in high-speed communication scenarios. Nevertheless, large\\nDoppler shifts induced by time-varying channels may cause severe inter-carrier\\ninterference (ICI). Frequency domain shows the potential of reducing ISAC\\ncomplexity as compared with other domains. However, parameter mismatching issue\\nstill exists for such sensing. In this paper, we develop a novel sensing scheme\\nbased on sparse Bayesian framework, where the delay and Doppler estimation\\nproblem in time-varying channels is formulated as a 3D multiple\\nmeasurement-sparse signal recovery (MM-SSR) problem. We then propose a novel\\ntwo-layer variational Bayesian inference (VBI) method to decompose the 3D\\nMM-SSR problem into two layers and estimate the Doppler in the first layer and\\nthe delay in the second layer alternatively. Subsequently, as is benefited from\\nnewly unveiled signal construction, a simplified two-stage multiple signal\\nclassification (MUSIC)-based VBI method is proposed, where the delay and the\\nDoppler are estimated by MUSIC and VBI, respectively. Additionally, the\\nCram\\\\'er-Rao bound (CRB) of the considered sensing parameters is derived to\\ncharacterize the lower bound for the proposed estimators. Corroborated by\\nextensive simulation results, our proposed method can achieve improved mean\\nsquare error (MSE) than its conventional counterparts and is robust against the\\ntarget number and target speed, thereby validating its wide applicability and\\nadvantages over prior arts.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T11:53:44Z\"}"}
