Using coupling techniques and stability\\nestimates in the Wasserstein-1 (Kantorovich-Rubinstein) metric, we derive sharp\\nerror bounds that reflect the nonlinear interaction structure of the models.\\nOur framework includes classical Nanbu Monte Carlo method and more recent\\ndevelopments as Time Relaxed Monte Carlo methods. The results bridge the gap\\nbetween probabilistic particle approximations and deterministic numerical error\\nanalysis, and provide a unified perspective for the convergence theory of Monte\\nCarlo methods for Boltzmann-type equations. As a by-product, we also obtain\\nexistence and uniqueness of solutions to a large class of Boltzmann-type\\nequations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T10:55:04Z\"}"}
