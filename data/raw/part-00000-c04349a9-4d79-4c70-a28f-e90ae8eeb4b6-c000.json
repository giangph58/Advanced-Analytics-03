The pricing problem, which is iteratively solved in CG,\\ncan be reduced to an unconstrained 0-1 quadratic programming problem, allowing\\nfor the efficient application of quantum annealing (QA). The solutions obtained\\nby CG are continuous relaxations, which cannot be practically used as feasible\\n0-1 solutions. This study proposes a post-processing method for constructing\\nfeasible 0-1 solutions from the continuous relaxations obtained through CG.\\nNumerical experiments on randomly generated problems demonstrate that CG with\\nthe proposed post-processing yields solutions comparable to commercial solvers\\nwith significantly reduced computation time.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.dis-nn\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:00:12Z\"}"}
