{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00279v1\", \"title\": \"Policies of Multiple Skill Levels for Better Strength Estimation in\\n  Games\", \"summary\": \"Accurately estimating human skill levels is crucial for designing effective\\nhuman-AI interactions so that AI can provide appropriate challenges or\\nguidance. In games where AI players have beaten top human professionals,\\nstrength estimation plays a key role in adapting AI behavior to match human\\nskill levels. In a previous state-of-the-art study, researchers have proposed a\\nstrength estimator trained using human players' match data. Given some matches,\\nthe strength estimator computes strength scores and uses them to estimate\\nplayer ranks (skill levels). In this paper, we focus on the observation that\\nhuman players' behavior tendency varies according to their strength and aim to\\nimprove the accuracy of strength estimation by taking this into account.\\nSpecifically, in addition to strength scores, we obtain policies for different\\nskill levels from neural networks trained using human players' match data. We\\nthen combine features based on these policies with the strength scores to\\nestimate strength. We conducted experiments on Go and chess. For Go, our method\\nachieved an accuracy of 80% in strength estimation when given 10 matches, which\\nincreased to 92% when given 20 matches. In comparison, the previous\\nstate-of-the-art method had an accuracy of 71% with 10 matches and 84% with 20\\nmatches, demonstrating improvements of 8-9%. We observed similar improvements\\nin chess. These results contribute to developing a more accurate strength\\nestimation method and to improving human-AI interaction.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T04:02:20Z\"}"}
