Distinct interactions between dislocations and grain\\nboundaries can lead to entirely different overall plastic deformation\\ncharacteristics. This paper employs a two-dimensional continuum dislocation\\ndynamics model to investigate the mechanical properties of materials. To\\naccurately depict the physical interactions between lattice dislocations and\\ninterfaces/grain boundaries, we apply a mesoscale interface boundary condition,\\nconsidering various numerical cases, such as single and multiple slip systems.\\nApart from affecting strength and ductility, the accumulation of dislocations\\nnear the interface can induce local high stress, potentially resulting in\\nbrittle fracture near the interface. Consequently, materials experience a\\ncompetition between ductile and brittle fracture modes during the loading\\nprocess. A phenomenon known as the strain hardening rate up-turn is also\\ninvestigated under different reaction constants, which can be explained by the\\ncompetition between the rates of dislocation accumulation and reaction at the\\ninterface.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T03:35:42Z\"}"}
