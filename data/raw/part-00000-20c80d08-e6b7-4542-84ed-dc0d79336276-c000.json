{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00361v1\", \"title\": \"Matrix Healy Plot: A Practical Tool for Visual Assessment of\\n  Matrix-Variate Normality\", \"summary\": \"Matrix-valued data, where each observation is represented as a matrix,\\nfrequently arises in various scientific disciplines. Modeling such data often\\nrelies on matrix-variate normal distributions, making matrix-variate normality\\ntesting crucial for valid statistical inference. Recently, the\\nDistance-Distance (DD) plot has been introduced as a graphical tool for\\nvisually assessing matrix-variate normality. However, the Mahalanobis squared\\ndistances (MSD) used in the DD plot require vectorizing matrix observations,\\nrestricting its applicability to cases where the dimension of the vectorized\\ndata does not exceed the sample size. To address this limitation, we propose a\\nnovel graphical method called the Matrix Healy (MHealy) plot, an extension of\\nthe Healy plot for vector-valued data. This new plot is based on more accurate\\nmatrix-based MSD that leverages the inherent structure of matrix data.\\nConsequently, it offers a more reliable visual assessment. Importantly, the\\nMHealy plot eliminates the sample size restriction of the DD plot and hence\\nmore applicable to matrix-valued data. Empirical results demonstrate its\\neffectiveness and practicality compared to the DD plot across various\\nscenarios, particularly in cases where the DD plot is not available due to\\nlimited sample sizes.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T07:20:25Z\"}"}
