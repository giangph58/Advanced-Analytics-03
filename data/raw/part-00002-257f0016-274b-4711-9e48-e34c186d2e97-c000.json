{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00597v1\", \"title\": \"Closed-form expressions for the centroid-tilt error due to scintillation\", \"summary\": \"In adaptive optics, the tracker and wavefront sensor commonly measure\\nirradiance centroids (in their respective focal planes) to estimate the\\nturbulence-degraded wavefront in the pupil plane. Several factors affect the\\naccuracy of these centroid measurements, including noise, speckle, and\\nscintillation. The centroid-tilt or ``C-tilt'' errors due to these factors have\\nbeen studied by numerous researchers; however, to our knowledge, closed-form\\nexpressions for the C-tilt error due to scintillation have not been found.\\n  In this paper, we derive such expressions, assuming spherical-wave\\nillumination of the pupil, a path-invariant index of refraction structure\\nconstant $C_n^2$, and Kolmogorov turbulence. We compare the analytically\\npredicted C-tilt values to those obtained by wave-optics simulations. The\\nagreement, at large, is quite good over a wide range of conditions. As a\\nresult, researchers and engineers will find this analysis useful when\\nquantifying the performance of centroid-based trackers and wavefront sensors,\\nboth of which are critical adaptive-optics components.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T15:30:33Z\"}"}
