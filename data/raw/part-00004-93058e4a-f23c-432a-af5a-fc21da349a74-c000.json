A pilot spectroscopic\\n  study\", \"summary\": \"The population of high-redshift radio galaxies (HzRGs) is still poorly\\nstudied because only a few of these objects are currently known. We here\\npresent the results of a pilot project of spectroscopic identification of HzRG\\ncandidates. The candidates are selected by combining low-frequency radio and\\noptical surveys that cover a total of ~2,000 squared degrees using the dropout\\ntechnique, that is, the presence of a redshifted Lyman break in their\\nphotometric data. We focused on 39 g-dropout sources, which is about one-third\\nof the selected sources, that are expected to be at 3.0 < z < 4.5.\\n  We considered single and double radio sources separately and searched for\\ng-dropout sources at the location of the midpoint of the radio structure for\\nthe latter. The host galaxy is expected to be located there. We confirm only\\none out of 29 candidate HzRG associated with an extended radio source. For the\\ncompact radio sources, we instead reach a success rate of 30% by confirming 3\\nout of 10 HzRG targets.\\n  The four newly discovered HzRGs show a wide range of spectral radio slopes.\\nThis supports the idea that not all HzRGs are ultrasteep radio sources (USSs).\\nThe criterion for USSs is most commonly used to find HzRGs, but this method\\nonly selects a subpopulation. We discuss various contamination sources for the\\nobjects that are selected with the Lyman-break method and conclude that they\\nare likely mainly HzRGs, but with a Ly$\\\\alpha$ line that is underluminous with\\nrespect to expectations.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:01:22Z\"}"}
