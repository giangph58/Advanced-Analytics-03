Our experimental results are supported by a\\nsimulation of excited multiplet spectra with atomistic calculations; they prove\\nthat the so-called third rule of Thole and van der Laan, which relates the\\nbranching ratio of the spin-orbit split resonances to the total angular\\nmomentum $J$ of the excited ion, is also valid in non-equilibrium. The\\npresented detection scheme allows to detect $J$-changing excitation,\\n\\\\textit{i.e}, alterations of spin and orbital states, even in samples without\\nnet magnetization. This makes branching-ratio spectroscopy a powerful tool for\\nthe quantitative investigation of ultrafast changes in angular momentum $J$.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T09:41:32Z\"}"}
