Consequently the\\nbase space of such an $S^{1}$-bundle can be realized as\\n$\\\\mathbb{C}^{\\\\ast}$-quotient of a conical special complex manifold. As a\\ncorollary, we give an intrinsic characterization of a projective special\\ncomplex manifold generalizing Mantegazza's characterization of a projective\\nspecial K\\\\\\\"ahler manifold. Our characterization is in the language of\\nc-projective structures. As an application, a non-trivial $S^1$-family of\\nObata-Ricci-flat hypercomplex structures (given by a generalization of the\\nrigid c-map) on the tangent bundle of the total space of a\\n$\\\\mathbb{C}^*$-bundle over a complex manifold with certain kind of c-projective\\nstructure is constructed. Finally, we show that the quaternionic structure\\nunderlying any of these hypercomplex structures is in general not flat and that\\nits flatness implies the vanishing of the c-projective Weyl tensor of the base\\nof the $\\\\mathbb{C}^*$-bundle. Conversely, any c-projectively flat complex\\nmanifold satisfying a cohomological integrality condition gives rise to a flat\\nquaternionic structure.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T06:44:58Z\"}"}
