Physics naturally suggests a generalization of\\nfactorization algebras, aimed at capturing nonperturbative information, and we\\nexplain how higher group symmetries offer examples of this generalization,\\nproviding an extension of the nonabelian Poincar\\\\'e duality of Salvatore and\\nLurie. Finally, we explore how continuous generalized symmetries and anomalies\\ncan be cast in this framework.\", \"main_category\": \"math-ph\", \"categories\": \"math-ph,hep-th,math.AT,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T03:02:00Z\"}"}
