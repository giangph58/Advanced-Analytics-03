We present a formulation which\\ngeneralizes the one by Zakharov-Craig-Sulem for irrotational water waves, and\\nthe one by Constantin-Ivanov-Prodanov for water waves with constant vorticity\\nand flat bottom topography. We study in detail an operator which appears in\\nsuch formulation, extending well-known results for the classical\\nDirichlet-Neumann operator, such as an analiticity result, the Taylor expansion\\nin homogeneous powers of the wave profile, and a paralinearization formula. As\\nan application, we prove a local well-posedness result.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T17:20:33Z\"}"}
