Though, most studies have\\nonly focused on the benefits and challenges, and have failed to analyse law\\nfirm management areas requiring software solutions. The principal objective of\\nthis paper was to investigate the level of technology adoption among Nigerian\\nlaw firms, as well as to develop a software solution to automate work processes\\nin identified areas. This investigation was done using systematic literature\\nreview to gather relevant data on the subject area and identify knowledge gaps.\\nFindings from the research indicated a need for further analysis of the various\\nareas in law practice that could require software solutions. The findings also\\ndiscussed the implementation of a property management module which is an\\nimportant contribution to the management of law firms in Nigeria. A\\nspeech-to-text transcription feature was also implemented to eliminate the need\\nfor lengthy typing.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T17:21:25Z\"}"}
