{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15570v1\", \"title\": \"Hypertrees and their host trees: a survey\", \"summary\": \"A hypergraph $\\\\mathcal{H}=(V,\\\\mathcal{E})$ is a hypertree if it admits a tree\\n$T$ with vertex set $V$ such that every edge of $\\\\mathcal{H}$ induces a subtree\\nof $T$. A tree like that is called a host tree. Several characterizations and\\nproperties of hypertrees have been discovered over the years. However, the\\ninterest in the structure of their host trees was weaker and restricted to\\nparticular scenarios where they arise, like the clique tree of chordal graphs.\\nIn that special case, the proofs of most characteristics of clique trees that\\nexist in the literature rely significantly on the structural properties of\\nchordal graphs. The purpose of this work is the study of the properties of the\\nhost trees of hypertrees in a more general context and have them described in a\\nsingle place, giving simpler proofs for known facts, generalizing others and\\nintroducing some new concepts that the author considers that are relevant for\\nthe study of the topic. Particularly, we will determine what edges can be found\\nin some host tree of a hypertree, and how these edges must be combined to form\\na host tree, with an emphasis in tools like the basis and the completion of a\\nhypergraph, and the concept of equivalent hypergraphs.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,G.2.2\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T03:56:15Z\"}"}
