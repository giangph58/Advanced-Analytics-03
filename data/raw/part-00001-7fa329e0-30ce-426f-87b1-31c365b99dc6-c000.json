{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20411v1\", \"title\": \"ADiff4TPP: Asynchronous Diffusion Models for Temporal Point Processes\", \"summary\": \"This work introduces a novel approach to modeling temporal point processes\\nusing diffusion models with an asynchronous noise schedule. At each step of the\\ndiffusion process, the noise schedule injects noise of varying scales into\\ndifferent parts of the data. With a careful design of the noise schedules,\\nearlier events are generated faster than later ones, thus providing stronger\\nconditioning for forecasting the more distant future. We derive an objective to\\neffectively train these models for a general family of noise schedules based on\\nconditional flow matching. Our method models the joint distribution of the\\nlatent representations of events in a sequence and achieves state-of-the-art\\nresults in predicting both the next inter-event time and event type on\\nbenchmark datasets. Additionally, it flexibly accommodates varying lengths of\\nobservation and prediction windows in different forecasting settings by\\nadjusting the starting and ending points of the generation process. Finally,\\nour method shows superior performance in long-horizon prediction tasks,\\noutperforming existing baseline methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T04:17:39Z\"}"}
