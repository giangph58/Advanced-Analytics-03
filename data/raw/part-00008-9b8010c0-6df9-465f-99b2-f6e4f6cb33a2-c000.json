The progenitor exhibited a ~0.7 mag\\ndecline in F814W from 2001 to 2013, followed by significant brightness and\\ncolor fluctuations in the g, r and z bands. This is the first time that a\\nvariable progenitor has been found for a SN IIb. We suggest that the\\nvariability is caused by intrinsic changes in the progenitor star instead of\\nvarying obscuration by circumstellar dust. Our results show that the progenitor\\nof SN 2024abfo was likely a yellow supergiant star with an initial mass of\\n12--14, 14--15 and 15--18 Msun for different assumed values of circumstellar\\nreddening of E(B-V)_CSM = 0, 0.1 and 0.2 mag. Our study underscores the\\ncritical role of multi-epoch imaging surveys in revealing the final stages of\\ncore-collapse supernovae progenitors.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T04:05:20Z\"}"}
