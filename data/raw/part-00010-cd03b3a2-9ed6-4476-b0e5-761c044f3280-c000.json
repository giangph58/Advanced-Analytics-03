First we introduce a slightly modified virtual noise\\nrepresentation which further illuminates the parallels to the classical design\\napproach for uncorrelated observations. We suggest more efficient algorithms to\\nobtain the design measures. Furthermore, we show that various convex relaxation\\nmethods used for sensor selection are special cases of our approach and can be\\nsolved within our framework. Finally, we provide practical guidelines on how to\\ngenerally approach a design problem with correlated observations and\\ndemonstrate how to utilize the virtual noise method in this context in a\\nmeaningful way.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,stat.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:22:02Z\"}"}
