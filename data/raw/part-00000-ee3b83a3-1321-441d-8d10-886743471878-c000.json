As centralized learning may\\nsuffer from data privacy, model heterogeneity and communication overhead\\nissues, federated learning (FL) has been introduced to support V2X. However,\\nthe practical deployment of FL faces critical challenges: model performance\\ndegradation from label imbalance across vehicles and training instability\\ninduced by modality disparities in sensor-equipped agents. To overcome these\\nlimitations, we propose a generative FL approach for beam selection (GFL4BS).\\nOur solution features two core innovations: 1) An adaptive zero-shot\\nmulti-modal generator coupled with spectral-regularized loss functions to\\nenhance the expressiveness of synthetic data compensating for both label\\nscarcity and missing modalities; 2) A hybrid training paradigm integrating\\nfeature fusion with decentralized optimization to ensure training resilience\\nwhile minimizing communication costs. Experimental evaluations demonstrate\\nsignificant improvements over baselines achieving 16.2% higher accuracy than\\nthe current state-of-the-art under severe label imbalance conditions while\\nmaintaining over 70% successful rate even when two agents lack both LiDAR and\\nRGB camera inputs.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T03:32:00Z\"}"}
