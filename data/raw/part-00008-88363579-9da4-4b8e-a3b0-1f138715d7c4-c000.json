In this paper, we introduce an advanced generalization of\\nthe FJ model, termed FJ-MM which incorporates both memory effects and multi-hop\\n(higher-order neighbor) influence. This formulation allows agents to naturally\\nincorporate both current and previous opinions at each iteration stage. Our\\nnumerical results demonstrate that incorporating memory and multi-hop influence\\nsignificantly reshapes the opinion landscape; for example, the final opinion\\nprofile can exhibit reduced polarization. We analyze the stability and\\nequilibrium properties of the FJ-MM model, showing that these properties can be\\nreduced to those of a comparison model--namely, the standard FJ model with a\\nmodified influence matrix. This reduction enables us to leverage established\\nstability results from FJ dynamics. Additionally, we examine the convergence\\nrate of the FJ-MM model and demonstrate that, as can be expected, the time lags\\nintroduced by memory and higher-order neighbor influences result in slower\\nconvergence.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.MA,cs.SY,math.OC,physics.soc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T09:43:04Z\"}"}
