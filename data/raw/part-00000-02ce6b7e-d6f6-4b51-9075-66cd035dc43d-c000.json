{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19531v1\", \"title\": \"Precision Determination of Scintillation Screen Parameters from Annual\\n  Modulation Measurement of Pulsar Scintillation Arc Curvature with the FAST\\n  Telescope\", \"summary\": \"Pulsar scintillation observations have revealed ubiquitous discrete\\nscintillation screens in the interstellar medium. A major obstacle in\\nidentifying the nature of these screens is the uncertainty in their distances,\\nwhich prevents precise correlation with known structures in the Milky Way. We\\nused the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) to\\nobserve PSR B1237+25, PSR 1842+14, and PSR 2021+51. We detected 10\\nscintillation arcs in PSR B1237+25, 1 in PSR 1842+14, and at least 6 in PSR\\n2021+51. By modeling the annual modulation of these scintillation arcs, we\\nconstrained the distances of the scintillation screens, as well as the\\nanisotropic scattering directions and the projected velocities in those\\ndirections. The scintillation screens are distributed throughout the entire\\npaths between Earth and the pulsars. Among these, the distance to the main\\nscintillation screen toward PSR B1237+25 is $267^{+32}_{-28}$ pc, the\\nscintillation screen toward PSR B1842+14 is at a distance of\\n$240^{+210}_{-120}$ pc, and the main scintillation screen toward PSR B2021+51\\nis located at $887^{+167}_{-132}$ pc. Several screens in our sample appear at\\ndistances coinciding with the Local Bubble boundary, particularly the brightest\\nscintillation arc toward PSR B1237+25. We provide a substantial sample of\\nscintillation screen measurements, revealing the rich plasma density\\nfluctuation structures present in the Milky Way.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T07:14:56Z\"}"}
