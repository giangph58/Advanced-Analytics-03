{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19698v1\", \"title\": \"Advances in Approximate Bayesian Inference for Models in Epidemiology\", \"summary\": \"Bayesian inference methods are useful in infectious diseases modeling due to\\ntheir capability to propagate uncertainty, manage sparse data, incorporate\\nlatent structures, and address high-dimensional parameter spaces. However,\\nparameter inference through assimilation of observational data in these models\\nremains challenging. While asymptotically exact Bayesian methods offer\\ntheoretical guarantees for accurate inference, they can be computationally\\ndemanding and impractical for real-time outbreak analysis. This review\\nsynthesizes recent advances in approximate Bayesian inference methods that aim\\nto balance inferential accuracy with scalability. We focus on four prominent\\nfamilies: Approximate Bayesian Computation, Bayesian Synthetic Likelihood,\\nIntegrated Nested Laplace Approximation, and Variational Inference. For each\\nmethod, we evaluate its relevance to epidemiological applications, emphasizing\\ninnovations that improve both computational efficiency and inference accuracy.\\nWe also offer practical guidance on method selection across a range of modeling\\nscenarios. Finally, we identify hybrid exact approximate inference as a\\npromising frontier that combines methodological rigor with the scalability\\nneeded for the response to outbreaks. This review provides epidemiologists with\\na conceptual framework to navigate the trade-off between statistical accuracy\\nand computational feasibility in contemporary disease modeling.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,stat.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T11:52:27Z\"}"}
