In particular, we focus on a subgroup of the\\nT-duality group $O(D+16,D,\\\\mathbb{Z})$ with $D=2$ given by an outer\\nautomorphism of the Narain lattice, which can be mapped to the Siegel modular\\ngroup $\\\\mathrm{Sp}(4,\\\\mathbb{Z})$. We classify the modular symmetries and a\\n$CP$-like symmetry on $T^2$ and its orbifolds with symmetric and asymmetric\\norbifold twists. It turns out that the non-supersymmetric heterotic string\\ntheories only enjoy a part of modular symmetries in contrast to supersymmetric\\nones. Furthermore, the gauge symmetry is maximally enhanced at fixed points of\\nmodular symmetries on $T^2$ on which we analyze the vacuum structure of\\neight-dimensional tachyon-free vacua.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T05:42:06Z\"}"}
