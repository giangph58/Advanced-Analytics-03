{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19968v1\", \"title\": \"How Group Lives Go Well\", \"summary\": \"This paper explores the ontological space of group well being, proposing a\\nframework for representing collective welfare, group functions, and long term\\ncontributions within an ontology engineering context. Traditional well being\\ntheories focus on individual states, often relying on hedonistic, desire\\nsatisfaction, or objective list models. Such approaches struggle to account for\\ncases where individual sacrifices contribute to broader social progress, a\\ncritical challenge in modeling group flourishing. To address this, the paper\\nrefines and extends the Counterfactual Account (CT) of well being, which\\nevaluates goodness of an event by comparing an individual's actual well being\\nwith a hypothetical counterpart in a nearby possible world. While useful, this\\nframework is insufficient for group level ontologies, where well being depends\\non functional persistence, institutional roles, and historical impact rather\\nthan immediate individual outcomes. Drawing on Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), the\\npaper introduces a model in which group flourishing is evaluated in terms of\\ngroup functional, where members bear roles and exhibit persistence conditions\\nakin to biological systems or designed artifacts. This approach enables\\nsemantic interoperability for modeling longitudinal social contributions,\\nallowing for structured reasoning about group welfare, social institutions, and\\ngroup flourishing over time.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:40:06Z\"}"}
