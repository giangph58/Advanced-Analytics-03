{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17657v1\", \"title\": \"Fast and accurate modelling of Kerr-Brillouin combs in Fabry-Perot\\n  resonators\", \"summary\": \"We introduce a new mean-field equation for modeling Fabry-Perot resonators\\nfilled with a dispersive medium exhibiting both Brillouin and Kerr\\nnonlinearities, e.g. an optical fiber. This model is derived from a unified\\nframework that accounts for Brillouin scattering and four-wave mixing. It\\ninvolves two coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equations for the forward and\\nbackward propagating fields, alongside a single equation governing the acoustic\\noscillation. Under standard assumptions for mean-field models -such as high\\nfinesse, weak nonlinearity, and weak dispersion- we demonstrate that our\\nequation closely matches the original system. The simplified and elegant\\nmathematical structure of our model provides valuable physical insights. As a\\nkey example, we derive an expression for the growth rate of harmonic\\nperturbations of steady states. Additionally, our model facilitates fast and\\naccurate numerical simulations using standard Fourier split-step methods. We\\nhighlight the effectiveness of this approach by simulating frequency comb\\ngeneration in state-of-the-art high-Q fiber Fabry-Perot resonators.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,nlin.PS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:26:28Z\"}"}
