Since they are\\ncommonly used to model economic and financial evolutions, the calibration and\\noptimal control of such processes are of interest to many communities and have\\nbeen the subject of extensive research. In this work, we develop an\\noptimization method working at the microscopic level. This allows us also to\\nreduce computational time since we can parallelize the calculations and do not\\nencounter the so-called curse of dimensionality that occurs when lifting the\\nproblem to its macroscopic counterpart using partial differential equations\\n(PDEs). Using a discretize-then-optimize approach, we derive an adjoint process\\nand an optimality system in the Lagrange framework. Then, we apply Monte Carlo\\nmethods to solve all the arising equations. We validate our optimization\\nstrategy by extensive numerical experiments. We also successfully test a\\noptimization procedure that avoids storing the information of the forward\\nequation.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T11:22:42Z\"}"}
