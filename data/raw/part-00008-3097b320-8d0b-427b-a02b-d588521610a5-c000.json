We find that spin depairing\\nstabilizes a superfluid state unique to the NH system. This phase is\\ncharacterized not only by a finite order parameter, but also by the emergence\\nof exceptional points (EPs) in the momentum space - a feature that starkly\\ncontrasts with previously discussed NH fermionic superfluidity, where EPs are\\nabsent within the superfluid state and emerge only at the onset of the\\nsuperfluid breakdown. We uncover the rich mechanism underlying this\\n``exceptional fermionic superfluidity'' by analyzing the interplay between EPs\\nand the effective density of states of the complex energy dispersion.\\nFurthermore, we reveal that the exceptional superfluid state breaks down\\ninduced by strong spin depairing on the cubic lattice, while it remains robust\\non the square lattice.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas,cond-mat.stat-mech,cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.supr-con,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T07:03:19Z\"}"}
