{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11794v1\", \"title\": \"Fast Baryonic Field Painting for Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Analyses: Transfer\\n  Function vs. Hybrid Effective Field Theory\", \"summary\": \"We present two approaches for \\\"painting\\\" baryonic properties relevant to the\\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect - optical depth and Compton-$y$ - onto\\n3-dimensional $N$-body simulations, using the MillenniumTNG suite as a\\nbenchmark. The goal of these methods is to produce fast and accurate\\nreconstruction methods to aid future analyses of baryonic feedback using the SZ\\neffect. The first approach employs a Gaussian Process emulator to model the SZ\\nquantities via a transfer function, while the second utilizes Hybrid Effective\\nField Theory (HEFT) to reproduce these quantities within the simulation. Our\\nanalysis involves comparing both methods to the true MillenniumTNG optical\\ndepth and Compton-$y$ fields using several metrics, including the\\ncross-correlation coefficient, power spectrum, and power spectrum error.\\nAdditionally, we assess how well the reconstructed fields correlate with dark\\nmatter haloes across various mass thresholds. The results indicate that the\\ntransfer function method yields more accurate reconstructions for fields with\\ninitially high correlations ($r \\\\approx 1$), such as between the optical depth\\nand dark matter fields. Conversely, the HEFT-based approach proves more\\neffective in enhancing correlations for fields with weaker initial correlations\\n($r \\\\sim 0.5$), such as between the Compton-$y$ and dark matter fields. Lastly,\\nwe discuss extensions of our methods to improve the reconstruction performance\\nat the field level.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T06:00:21Z\"}"}
