{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19586v1\", \"title\": \"A Universal Spin-Orbit-Coupled Hamiltonian Model for Accelerated Quantum\\n  Material Discovery\", \"summary\": \"The accurate modeling of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects in diverse complex\\nsystems remains a significant challenge due to the high computational demands\\nof density functional theory (DFT) and the limited transferability of existing\\nmachine-learning frameworks. This study addresses these limitations by\\nintroducing Uni-HamGNN, a universal SOC Hamiltonian graph neural network that\\nis applicable across the periodic table. By decomposing the SOC Hamiltonian\\ninto spin-independent and SOC correction terms, our approach preserves SU(2)\\nsymmetry while significantly reducing parameter requirements. Based on this\\ndecomposition, we propose a delta-learning strategy to separately fit the two\\ncomponents, thereby addressing the training difficulties caused by magnitude\\ndiscrepancies between them and enabling efficient training. The model achieves\\nremarkable accuracy (mean absolute error of 0.0025 meV for the SOC-related\\ncomponent) and demonstrates broad applicability through high-throughput\\nscreening of the GNoME dataset for topological insulators, as well as precise\\npredictions for 2D valleytronic materials and transition metal dichalcogenide\\n(TMD) heterostructures. This breakthrough eliminates the need for\\nsystem-specific retraining and costly SOC-DFT calculations, paving the way for\\nrapid discovery of quantum materials.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T08:47:45Z\"}"}
