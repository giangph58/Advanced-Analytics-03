{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00631v1\", \"title\": \"Bayes-Optimal Fair Classification with Multiple Sensitive Features\", \"summary\": \"Existing theoretical work on Bayes-optimal fair classifiers usually considers\\na single (binary) sensitive feature. In practice, individuals are often defined\\nby multiple sensitive features. In this paper, we characterize the\\nBayes-optimal fair classifier for multiple sensitive features under general\\napproximate fairness measures, including mean difference and mean ratio. We\\nshow that these approximate measures for existing group fairness notions,\\nincluding Demographic Parity, Equal Opportunity, Predictive Equality, and\\nAccuracy Parity, are linear transformations of selection rates for specific\\ngroups defined by both labels and sensitive features. We then characterize that\\nBayes-optimal fair classifiers for multiple sensitive features become\\ninstance-dependent thresholding rules that rely on a weighted sum of these\\ngroup membership probabilities. Our framework applies to both attribute-aware\\nand attribute-blind settings and can accommodate composite fairness notions\\nlike Equalized Odds. Building on this, we propose two practical algorithms for\\nBayes-optimal fair classification via in-processing and post-processing. We\\nshow empirically that our methods compare favorably to existing methods.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ML\", \"categories\": \"stat.ML,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T16:12:12Z\"}"}
