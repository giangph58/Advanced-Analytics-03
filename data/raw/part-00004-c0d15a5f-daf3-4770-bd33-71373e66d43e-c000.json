{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21475v1\", \"title\": \"Advancing Arabic Reverse Dictionary Systems: A Transformer-Based\\n  Approach with Dataset Construction Guidelines\", \"summary\": \"This study addresses the critical gap in Arabic natural language processing\\nby developing an effective Arabic Reverse Dictionary (RD) system that enables\\nusers to find words based on their descriptions or meanings. We present a novel\\ntransformer-based approach with a semi-encoder neural network architecture\\nfeaturing geometrically decreasing layers that achieves state-of-the-art\\nresults for Arabic RD tasks. Our methodology incorporates a comprehensive\\ndataset construction process and establishes formal quality standards for\\nArabic lexicographic definitions. Experiments with various pre-trained models\\ndemonstrate that Arabic-specific models significantly outperform general\\nmultilingual embeddings, with ARBERTv2 achieving the best ranking score\\n(0.0644). Additionally, we provide a formal abstraction of the reverse\\ndictionary task that enhances theoretical understanding and develop a modular,\\nextensible Python library (RDTL) with configurable training pipelines. Our\\nanalysis of dataset quality reveals important insights for improving Arabic\\ndefinition construction, leading to eight specific standards for building\\nhigh-quality reverse dictionary resources. This work contributes significantly\\nto Arabic computational linguistics and provides valuable tools for language\\nlearning, academic writing, and professional communication in Arabic.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T09:56:36Z\"}"}
