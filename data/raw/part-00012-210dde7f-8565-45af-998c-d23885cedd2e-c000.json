We\\nshow that regular static vortex solutions are obtained only for the nonzero\\ncritical cubic Yukawa type coupling between neutral and complex scalar fields.\\nSince the Coulombic electric field is exactly cancelled by the phonon, the\\nobtained charged vortices have finite energy. When the quartic self-interaction\\ncoupling of complex scalar field has the critical value, the BPS\\n(Bogomolny-Prasad-Sommerfield) bound is saturated for multiple charged vortices\\nof arbitrary separations and hence the borderline of type I and II\\nsuperconductors is achieved in nonperturbative regime.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.str-el,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T12:18:30Z\"}"}
