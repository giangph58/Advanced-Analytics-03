In this paper, we demonstrate that the minimum distance\\n$d$ of $\\\\mathcal{C}_{(q,q^m+1,3,h)}$ equals 3 if and only if\\n$\\\\gcd(2h+1,q+1,q^m+1)\\\\ne1$. When both $q$ and $m$ are odd, we determine the\\nsufficient and necessary condition for $d=4$ and fully characterize the minimum\\ndistance in this case. Based on these conditions, we investigate the parameters\\nof $\\\\mathcal{C}_{(q,q^m+1,3,h)}$ for certain $h$. Additionally, two infinite\\nfamilies of distance-optimal codes and several linear codes with the best known\\nparameters are presented.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T11:02:46Z\"}"}
