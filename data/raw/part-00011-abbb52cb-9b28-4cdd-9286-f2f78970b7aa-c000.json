We show that every non-reflexive\\nBanach space admits an equivalent norm having a point in the corresponding unit\\nsphere which is not almost locally uniformly rotund, and which is strongly\\nexposed by all its supporting functionals. This result is in contrast with a\\ncharacterization due to P. Bandyopadhyay, D. Huang, and B.-L. Lin from 2004. We\\nalso show that such a characterization remains true in reflexive Banach spaces.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T09:03:25Z\"}"}
