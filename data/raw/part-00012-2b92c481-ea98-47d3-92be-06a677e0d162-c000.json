In tree-level\\ngravity there are universal soft theorems for the three leading orders in the\\nsoft expansion, and they can be shown to be equivalent to Ward identities of\\nasymptotic symmetries. While the leading and subleading symmetries are\\nunderstood as supertranslations and superrotations respectively, the precise\\nsymmetry interpretation of the sub-subleading soft theorem is still a matter of\\ninvestigation. The form of the sub-subleading soft graviton theorem was\\nelucidated by Cachazo and Strominger using a BCFW expansion of graviton\\namplitudes. In this work we show that consistency with results based on\\nasymptotic charges requires a careful treatment of collinear singularities in\\nthe amplitude, giving rise to collinear corrections to the usual\\nCachazo-Strominger soft theorem.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T17:27:52Z\"}"}
