{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11141v1\", \"title\": \"A definition of the background state of the atmosphere using optimal\\n  transport\", \"summary\": \"The dynamics of atmospheric disturbances are often described in terms of\\ndisplacements of air parcels relative to their locations in a notional\\nbackground state. Modified Lagrangian Mean (MLM) states have been proposed by\\nM. E. McIntyre using the Lagrangian conserved variables potential vorticity and\\npotential temperature to label air parcels, thus avoiding the need to calculate\\ntrajectories explicitly. Methven and Berrisford further defined a zonally\\nsymmetric MLM state for global atmospheric flow in terms of mass in zonal\\nangular momentum ($z$) and potential temperature ($\\\\theta$) coordinates. We\\nprove that for any snapshot of an atmospheric flow in a single hemisphere,\\nthere exists a unique energy-minimising MLM state in geophysical coordinates\\n(latitude and pressure). Since the state is an energy minimum, it is suitable\\nfor quantification of finite amplitude disturbances and examining atmospheric\\ninstability. This state is obtained by solving a free surface problem, which we\\nframe as the minimisation of an optimal transport cost over a class of source\\nmeasures. The solution consists of a source measure, encoding surface pressure,\\nand an optimal transport map, connecting the distribution of mass in\\ngeophysical coordinates to the known distribution of mass in $(z, \\\\theta)$. We\\nshow that this problem reduces to an optimal transport problem with a known\\nsource measure, which has a numerically feasible discretisation. Additionally,\\nour results hold for a large class of cost functions, and generalise analogous\\nresults on free surface variants of the semi-geostrophic equations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T12:42:42Z\"}"}
