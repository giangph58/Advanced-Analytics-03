To get MAG started, one has to deal with the\\nproblem of \\\"gauge translations\\\". We first recall that Cartan geometry is the\\nproper mathematical foundation for gauge theories of gravity, and that this\\nproblem never arises in that framework, which still allows to clarify the\\ngeometric status of gauge translations. Then, we show how the MAG kinematics is\\nobtained via dressing in a technically streamlined way, which highlights that\\nit reduces to a Cartan-geometric kinematics.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:38:51Z\"}"}
