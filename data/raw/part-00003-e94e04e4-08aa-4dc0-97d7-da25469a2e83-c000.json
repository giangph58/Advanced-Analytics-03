By analyzing the system\\nat zero and infinite interaction strengths, we reveal a rescaling of momentum\\ndistributions accompanied by a self-similar behavior in first- and second-order\\ncorrelation functions. In excited states of non-interacting bosons, the\\nmomentum distribution shows a comb-like structure similar to that of\\nnon-interacting fermions but at a higher density. This is mirrored by Friedel\\noscillations in the one-body density matrix. At the same time, the\\ndensity-density correlations still exhibit the bosonic enhancement. Our work\\nillustrates how topological pumping induces a nontrivial mapping between\\nbosonic and fermionic correlations.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T08:28:04Z\"}"}
