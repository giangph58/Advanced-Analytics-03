In composed workflows,\\nwhere serverless functions need to exchange data constantly, serverless\\nplatforms rely on remote services such as object storage and key-value stores\\nas a common approach to exchange data. In WebAssembly, functions leverage\\nWebAssembly System Interface to connect to the network and exchange data via\\nremote services. As a consequence, co-located serverless functions need remote\\nservices to exchange data, increasing latency and adding network overhead. To\\nmitigate this problem, in this paper, we introduce CWASI: a WebAssembly\\nOCI-compliant runtime shim that determines the best inter-function data\\nexchange approach based on the serverless function locality. CWASI introduces a\\nthree-mode communication model for the Serverless Edge-Cloud continuum. This\\ncommunication model enables CWASI Shim to optimize inter-function communication\\nfor co-located functions by leveraging the function host mechanisms.\\nExperimental results show that CWASI reduces the communication latency between\\nthe co-located serverless functions by up to 95% and increases the\\ncommunication throughput by up to 30x.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T10:43:19Z\"}"}
