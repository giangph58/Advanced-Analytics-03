This becomes even more critical\\nduring anomaly conditions like the epidemic outbreak, during which couriers'\\ndelivery timely rate will decline markedly and fluctuates significantly.\\nExisting studies pay less attention to the logistics scenario. Moreover, many\\nworks focusing on prediction tasks in anomaly scenarios fail to explicitly\\nmodel abnormal events, e.g., treating external factors equally with other\\nfeatures, resulting in great information loss. Further, since some anomalous\\nevents occur infrequently, traditional data-driven methods perform poorly in\\nthese scenarios. To deal with them, we propose a deep spatial-temporal\\nattention model, named DeepSTA. To be specific, to avoid information loss, we\\ndesign an anomaly spatio-temporal learning module that employs a recurrent\\nneural network to model incident information. Additionally, we utilize Node2vec\\nto model correlations between road districts, and adopt graph neural networks\\nand long short-term memory to capture the spatial-temporal dependencies of\\ncouriers. To tackle the issue of insufficient training data in abnormal\\ncircumstances, we propose an anomaly pattern attention module that adopts a\\nmemory network for couriers' anomaly feature patterns storage via attention\\nmechanisms. The experiments on real-world logistics datasets during the\\nCOVID-19 outbreak in 2022 show the model outperforms the best baselines by\\n12.11% in MAE and 13.71% in MSE, demonstrating its superior performance over\\nmultiple competitive baselines.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T08:48:45Z\"}"}
