Without additional channel estimations, the proposed\\nDistributed Kernelized Upper Confidence Bound (DK-UCB) algorithm estimates the\\ncurrent instantaneous transmission rates utilizing past contexts, such as the\\nvehicle's location and velocity, along with past instantaneous transmission\\nrates. To capture the nonlinear mapping from a context to the instantaneous\\ntransmission rate, DK-UCB maps a context into the reproducing kernel Hilbert\\nspace (RKHS) where a linear mapping becomes observable. To improve estimation\\naccuracy, we propose a novel kernel function in RKHS which incorporates the\\npropagation characteristics of the mmWave signals. Moreover, DK-UCB encourages\\na vehicle to share necessary information when it has conducted significant\\nexplorations, which speeds up the learning process while maintaining affordable\\ncommunication costs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T08:05:27Z\"}"}
