While information\\nflow properties are relatively extensional and compositional, designing\\nexpressive systems that enforce such properties remains challenging. In\\nparticular, it can be difficult to use IFC labels to model certain security\\nassumptions, such as semi-honest agents.\\n  Motivated by these modeling limitations, we study the algebraic semantics of\\nlattice-based IFC label models, and propose a semantic framework that allows\\nformalizing asymmetric delegation, which is partial delegation of\\nconfidentiality or integrity. Our framework supports downgrading of information\\nand ensures their safety through nonmalleable information flow (NMIF).\\n  To demonstrate the practicality of our framework, we design and implement a\\nnovel algorithm that statically checks NMIF and a label inference procedure\\nthat efficiently supports bounded label polymorphism, allowing users to write\\ncode generic with respect to labels.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.PL\", \"categories\": \"cs.PL,cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T05:00:17Z\"}"}
