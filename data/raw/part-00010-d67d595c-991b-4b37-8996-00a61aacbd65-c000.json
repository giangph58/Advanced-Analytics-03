It\\nenables users to adjust their communication strategies dynamically, thereby\\nimproving the effectiveness of their communication. Generative AI holds\\nsignificant potential to enhance real-time reflection due to its ability to\\ncomprehensively understand the current context and generate personalized and\\nnuanced content. However, it is challenging to design the way of interaction\\nand information presentation to support the real-time workflow rather than\\ndisrupt it. In this position paper, we present a review of research on systems\\ndesigned for real-time reflection in different synchronous communication\\nscenarios. Based on that, we discuss how to design human-AI interaction to\\nsupport real-time reflection in synchronous communication scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T07:12:56Z\"}"}
