In general, ML\\nhealthcare applications crucially require performance, interpretability of\\ndata, and respect for data privacy. The latter is an increasingly debated topic\\nas commercial cloud computing services become more and more widespread.\\nRecently, dedicated methods are starting to be developed aiming to protect data\\nprivacy. However, these generally result in a trade-off forcing one to balance\\nthe level of data privacy and the algorithm performance. Here, a Support Vector\\nMachine (SVM) classifier model is proposed whose training is reformulated into\\na Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, and adapted to a\\nneutral atom-based Quantum Processing Unit (QPU). Our final model does not\\nrequire anonymization techniques to protect data privacy since the sensitive\\ndata are not needed to be transferred to the cloud-available QPU. Indeed, the\\nlatter is used only during the training phase, hence allowing a future concrete\\napplication in a real-world scenario. Finally, performance and scaling analyses\\non a publicly available breast cancer dataset are discussed, both using ideal\\nand noisy simulations for the training process, and also successfully tested on\\na currently available real neutral-atom QPU.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T17:03:35Z\"}"}
