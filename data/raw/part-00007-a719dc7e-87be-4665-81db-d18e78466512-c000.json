{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20517v1\", \"title\": \"Boundary Control and Calder\\u00f3n type Inverse Problems in Non-local heat\\n  equation\", \"summary\": \"We examine various density results related to the solutions of the non-local\\nheat equation at a specific time slice, focusing on two distinct models: one\\nwith homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition and the other with singular\\nboundary data. We explore both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the\\napproximations. Additionally, we address Calder\\\\'on-type inverse problems for\\nthese parabolic models, where we recover the potentials by analyzing the\\nsolutions either on the boundary or at a particular time slice. In both the\\ndensity results and the Calder\\\\'on type inverse problems, the Pohozaev identity\\nplays a crucial role. Finally, in the last section, we apply the Pohozaev\\nidentity to a specific elliptic eigenvalue problem and demonstrate that the\\neigenfunctions, when divided by an appropriate power of the distance function,\\ncan not vanish on any non-empty open subset of the boundary.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T07:59:11Z\"}"}
