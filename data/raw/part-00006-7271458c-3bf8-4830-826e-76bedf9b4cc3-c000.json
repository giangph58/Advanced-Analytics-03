One of the two authors has known Patrick Cattiaux for a very long\\ntime, and owes him a great deal. If we are to illustrate the adage that life is\\nmade up of chance, then what could be better than the meeting of two young\\npeople in the 80s, both of whom fell in love with the mathematics of\\nrandomness, and one of whom changed the other's life by letting him in on a\\nsecret: if you really believe in it, you can turn this passion into a\\nprofession. By another happy coincidence, this tribute comes at just the right\\ntime, as Michel Talagrand has been awarded the Abel prize. The temptation was\\ntherefore great to do a double. Following one of the many galleries opened up\\nby mathematics, we shall first draw a link between the mathematics of Patrick\\nCattiaux and that of Michel Talagrand. Then we shall show how the abstract\\nprobabilistic material on the concentration of product measures thus revisited\\ncan be used to shed light on cut-off phenomena in our field of expertise,\\nmathematical statistics. Nothing revolutionary here, as everyone knows the\\nimpact that Talagrand's work has had on the development of mathematical\\nstatistics since the late 90s, but we've chosen a very simple framework in\\nwhich everything can be explained with minimal technicality, leaving the main\\nideas to the fore.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T13:52:39Z\"}"}
