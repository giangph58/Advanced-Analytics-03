{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05156v1\", \"title\": \"Blending Queries and Conversations: Understanding Tactics, Trust,\\n  Verification, and System Choice in Web Search and Chat Interactions\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents a user study (N=22) where participants used an interface\\ncombining Web Search and a Generative AI-Chat feature to solve health-related\\ninformation tasks. We study how people behaved with the interface, why they\\nbehaved in certain ways, and what the outcomes of these behaviours were. A\\nthink-aloud protocol captured their thought processes during searches. Our\\nfindings suggest that GenAI is neither a search panacea nor a major regression\\ncompared to standard Web Search interfaces. Qualitative and quantitative\\nanalyses identified 78 tactics across five categories and provided insight into\\nhow and why different interface features were used. We find evidence that\\npre-task confidence and trust both influenced which interface feature was used.\\nIn both systems, but particularly when using the chat feature, trust was often\\nmisplaced in favour of ease-of-use and seemingly perfect answers, leading to\\nincreased confidence post-search despite having incorrect results. We discuss\\nwhat our findings mean in the context of our defined research questions and\\noutline several open questions for future research.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:59:55Z\"}"}
