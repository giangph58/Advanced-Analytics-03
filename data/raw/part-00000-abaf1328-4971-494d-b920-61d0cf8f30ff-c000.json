{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17305v1\", \"title\": \"Machine learning-based condition monitoring of powertrains in modern\\n  electric drives\", \"summary\": \"The recent technological advances in digitalization have revolutionized the\\nindustrial sector. Leveraging data analytics has now enabled the collection of\\ndeep insights into the performance and, as a result, the optimization of\\nassets. Industrial drives, for example, already accumulate all the necessary\\ninformation to control electric machines. These signals include but are not\\nlimited to currents, frequency, and temperature. Integrating machine learning\\n(ML) models responsible for predicting the evolution of those directly\\ncollected or implicitly derived parameters enhances the smartness of industrial\\nsystems even further. In this article, data already residing in most modern\\nelectric drives has been used to develop a data-driven thermal model of a power\\nmodule. A test bench has been designed and used specifically for training and\\nvalidating the thermal digital twin undergoing various static and dynamic\\noperating profiles. Different approaches, from traditional linear models to\\ndeep neural networks, have been implemented to emanate the best ML model for\\nestimating the case temperature of a power module. Several evaluation metrics\\nwere then used to assess the investigated methods' performance and\\nimplementation in industrial embedded systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T06:59:38Z\"}"}
