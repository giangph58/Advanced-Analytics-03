{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03418v1\", \"title\": \"Knowledge Augmented Complex Problem Solving with Large Language Models:\\n  A Survey\", \"summary\": \"Problem-solving has been a fundamental driver of human progress in numerous\\ndomains. With advancements in artificial intelligence, Large Language Models\\n(LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools capable of tackling complex problems\\nacross diverse domains. Unlike traditional computational systems, LLMs combine\\nraw computational power with an approximation of human reasoning, allowing them\\nto generate solutions, make inferences, and even leverage external\\ncomputational tools. However, applying LLMs to real-world problem-solving\\npresents significant challenges, including multi-step reasoning, domain\\nknowledge integration, and result verification. This survey explores the\\ncapabilities and limitations of LLMs in complex problem-solving, examining\\ntechniques including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, knowledge augmentation,\\nand various LLM-based and tool-based verification techniques. Additionally, we\\nhighlight domain-specific challenges in various domains, such as software\\nengineering, mathematical reasoning and proving, data analysis and modeling,\\nand scientific research. The paper further discusses the fundamental\\nlimitations of the current LLM solutions and the future directions of LLM-based\\ncomplex problems solving from the perspective of multi-step reasoning, domain\\nknowledge integration and result verification.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T10:53:58Z\"}"}
