The degree of entanglement can be assessed\\nby enumerating the entangled degrees of freedom, leading to the determination\\nof a parameter known as the Schmidt number. In this paper, we develop an\\nefficient analytical tool for characterizing high Schmidt number witnesses for\\nbipartite quantum states in arbitrary dimensions. Our methods not only offer\\nviable mathematical methods for constructing high-dimensional Schmidt number\\nwitnesses in theory but also simplify the quantification of entanglement and\\ndimensionality. Most notably, we develop high-dimensional Schmidt number\\nwitnesses within arbitrary-dimensional systems, with our Schmidt witness\\ncoefficients relying solely on the operator Schmidt coefficient. Subsequently,\\nwe demonstrate our theoretical advancements and computational superiority by\\nconstructing Schmidt number witnesses in arbitrary dimensional bipartite\\nquantum systems with Schmidt numbers four and five.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.NA,math-ph,math.MP,math.NA,math.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:15:16Z\"}"}
