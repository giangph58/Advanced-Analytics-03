We establish its well-posedness, and\\nin particular, the c\\\\`adl\\\\`ag property, which is not trivial in the infinite\\ndimensional case. Using a splitting technique, we decompose the velocity\\ncomponent into three parts, which gives convenience to the moment estimate. We\\nshow the tightness of solution of SWE by verifying the infinite dimensional\\nversion of Aldous condition. After these preparation, we pass the limit and\\nderive the approximation equation.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:24:45Z\"}"}
