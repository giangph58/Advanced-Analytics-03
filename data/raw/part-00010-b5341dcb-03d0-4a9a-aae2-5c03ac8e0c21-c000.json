{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11778v1\", \"title\": \"Spectroscopic evidence for possible quantum spin liquid behavior in a\\n  two-dimensional Mott insulator\", \"summary\": \"Mott insulators with localized magnetic moments will exhibit a quantum spin\\nliquid (QSL) state when the quantum fluctuations are strong enough to suppress\\nthe ordering of the spins. Such an entangled state will give rise to collective\\nexcitations, in which spin and charge information are carried separately. Our\\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements on single-layer\\n1T-TaS2 show a flat band around the zone center and a gap opening of about 200\\nmeV in the low temperature, indicating 2D Mott insulating nature in the system.\\nThis flat band is dispersionless in momentum space but shows anomalously broad\\nwidth around the zone center and the spectral weight decays rapidly as momentum\\nincreases. The observation is described as a spectral continuum from electron\\nfractionalization, corroborated by a low energy effective model.The intensity\\nof the flat band is reduced by surface doping with magnetic adatoms and the gap\\nis closing, a result from the interaction between spin impurities coupled with\\nspinons and the chargons, which gives rise to a charge redistribution. Doping\\nwith nonmagnetic impurities behaves differently as the chemical potential shift\\ndominates. These findings provide insight into the QSL states of strongly\\ncorrelated electrons on 2D triangular lattices.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T05:31:42Z\"}"}
