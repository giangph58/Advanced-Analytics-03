Using SDSS DR12\\nCMASS-NGC galaxies and simulated mock catalogs with $\\\\Omega_m$ varying in the\\nrange of 0.25-0.40, we quantify the discriminative power of different\\nstatistics via $\\\\Delta \\\\chi^2$ measurements. Our results demonstrate\\nsignificant improvements when incorporating weighted statistics. Especially,\\nadding the $\\\\bar{D}_{\\\\rm nei}$-weighting statistics enhances $\\\\Delta \\\\chi^2$ by\\n39%-130%, while adding the $1/\\\\bar{D}_{\\\\rm nei}$-weighted statistics yields\\n229%-336% gains over solely using the traditional angular statistics. These\\nfindings align with 3D correlation function studies \\\\cite{Yin+etal+2024},\\nconfirming the superior performance of $\\\\beta$-cosmic-web weighted statistics.\\nThe thin-redshift-slice approach makes our method particularly relevant for\\nslitless surveys (such as Euclid, CSST) where redshift errors challenge\\ntraditional 3D analyses. This work also establishes the first theoretical\\nframework for marked statistics in 2D angular clustering.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T10:58:09Z\"}"}
