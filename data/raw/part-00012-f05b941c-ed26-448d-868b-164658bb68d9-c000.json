This research introduces\\na hybrid deep learning model combining Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) and a\\nNeural Turing Machine (NTM) for enhanced intrusion detection. Trained on the\\nUNSW-NB15 and BoT-IoT datasets, the model employs GRU layers for sequential\\ndata processing and an NTM for long-term pattern recognition. The proposed\\napproach achieves 99% accuracy in distinguishing between normal, DoS, and DDoS\\ntraffic. These findings offer promising advancements in real-time threat\\ndetection and contribute to improved network security across various domains.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T06:08:04Z\"}"}
