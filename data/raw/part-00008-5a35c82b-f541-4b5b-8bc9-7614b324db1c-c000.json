{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04455v1\", \"title\": \"Reconfigurable Room Temperature Exchange Bias through N\\u00e9el Order\\n  Switching in van der Waals Heterostructures\", \"summary\": \"Exchange bias effect plays a crucial role in modern magnetic memory\\ntechnology. Recently, van der Waals magnetic materials have emerged and shown\\npotential in spintronic devices at atomic scale. Owing to their tunable\\nphysical properties and the flexibility in fabrication, the van der Waals\\nheterostructures offer more possibilities for investigating potential\\nmechanisms of the exchange bias effect. However, due to low magnetic ordering\\ntemperatures for most van der Waals magnets, to establish exchange bias in van\\nder Waals antiferromagnet/ferromagnet heterostructures at room temperature is\\nchallenging. In this study, we fabricate\\n(Fe$_{0.56}$Co$_{0.44}$)$_{5}$GeTe$_{2}$(FCGT)/Fe$_{3}$GaTe$_{2}$(FGaT)\\nheterostructures with magnetic ordering temperatures of each component well\\nabove room temperature to achieve a room temperature exchange bias effect. It\\nis found that the sign and magnitude of the exchange bias field can be\\nefficiently controlled by manipulating the N\\\\'eel order of FCGT with magnetic\\nfield. The manipulation of N\\\\'eel order shows significant magnetic field\\ndependence. A strong pre-set field induces a switch in the N\\\\'eel order of\\nFCGT, which aligns the interfacial magnetization at the FCGT/FGaT interface,\\nleading to robust exchange bias, as revealed by both transport measurements and\\nmacro-spin model calculations. Our findings demonstrate the intrinsic\\nmanipulation and switchable of room-temperature exchange bias in all-van der\\nWaals heterostructures and further promote the development of novel\\ntwo-dimensional spintronic devices.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:26:50Z\"}"}
