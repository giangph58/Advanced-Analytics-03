However, due to complex involvement of electron and lattice degrees of\\nfreedom and pronounced anharmonicity, theoretical simulations of the CDW phase\\ndiagram at the density-functional-theory level are often numerically demanding.\\nTo reduce the computational cost of first principles modelling by orders of\\nmagnitude, we have developed an electronic free energy machine learning model\\nfor monolayer NbSe$_2$ that allows changing both electronic and ionic\\ntemperatures independently. Our approach relies on a machine learning model of\\nthe electronic density of states and zero-temperature interatomic potential.\\nThis allows us to explore the CDW phase diagram of monolayer NbSe$_2$ both\\nunder thermal and laser-induced nonthermal conditions. Our study provides an\\naccurate estimate of the CDW transition temperature at low cost and can\\ndisentangle the role of hot electrons and phonons in nonthermal ultrafast\\nmelting process of the CDW phase in NbSe$_2$.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.str-el,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T16:16:32Z\"}"}
