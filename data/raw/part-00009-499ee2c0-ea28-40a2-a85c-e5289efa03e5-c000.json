The BOWIE-ALIGN programme is performing a comparative study of\\nJWST spectra of four aligned and four misaligned hot Jupiters, with the aim of\\ncharacterising their atmospheres and corroborating the link between the\\nobservables and the formation history. In this work, we present the $2.8-5.2$\\nmicron transmission spectrum of TrES-4b, a hot Jupiter with an orbit aligned\\nwith the rotation axis of its F-type host star. Using free chemistry\\natmospheric retrievals, we report a confident detection of H$_2$O at an\\nabundance of $\\\\log X_\\\\mathrm{H_2O}=-2.98^{+0.68}_{-0.73}$ at a significance of\\n$8.4\\\\sigma$. We also find evidence for CO and small amounts of CO$_2$,\\nretrieving abundances $\\\\log X_\\\\mathrm{CO}= -3.76^{+0.89}_{-1.01}$ and $\\\\log\\nX_\\\\mathrm{CO_2}= -6.86^{+0.62}_{-0.65}$ ($3.1\\\\sigma$ and $4.0\\\\sigma$\\nrespectively). The observations are consistent with the the atmosphere being in\\nchemical equilibrium; our retrievals yield $\\\\mathrm{C/O}$ between $0.30-0.42$\\nand constrain the atmospheric metallicity to the range $0.4-0.7\\\\times$ solar.\\nThe inferred sub-stellar properties (C/O and metallicity) challenge traditional\\nmodels, and could have arisen from an oxygen-rich gas accretion scenario, or a\\ncombination of low-metallicity gas and carbon-poor solid accretion.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:25:50Z\"}"}
