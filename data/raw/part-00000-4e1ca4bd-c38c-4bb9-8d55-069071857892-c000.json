The origin of\\nspin squeezing is attributed to the interaction between the nuclear quadrupole\\nmoment and the electric field gradients in the molecular environment. The\\nformal description of the nonlinear operators responsible for spin squeezing is\\nachieved using the spin angular momentum representation via the one-axis\\ntwisting mechanism. This approach provides a framework for quantum control and\\nmetrology over the spin squeezing process while accounting for the influence of\\nrelaxation phenomena. Non-Cartesian angular momentum operators are proposed,\\nwith their variance products catching the quantum effects during the dynamics.\\nAn upper bound for the squeezing parameter and the Heisenberg uncertainty at\\nthermal equilibrium are also predicted for any spin quantum number.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T16:47:41Z\"}"}
