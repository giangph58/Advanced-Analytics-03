{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12241v1\", \"title\": \"The Late-time Afterglow of GW170817 and Implications for Jet Dynamics\", \"summary\": \"GW170817 is the first binary neutron star merger detected with gravitational\\nand electromagnetic waves, and its afterglow is still detectable 7 years\\npost-merger. Some previous studies of the X-ray afterglow have claimed the\\nonset of a new afterglow component or raised concerns about the data processing\\ntechniques. Motivated thus, we present here a reanalysis of X-ray afterglow\\ndata for GW170817 and find potential sources of discrepancies between the data\\nreduction techniques employed by various research groups. We also analyze the\\nupdated panchromatic afterglow data to find that there is no significant\\nevidence for any new afterglow component (e.g. due to the ejecta that gave rise\\nto the kilonova) and that the jet must be still in a mildly relativistic phase.\\nThe decline in the afterglow light curve is significantly shallower compared to\\nthat expected from the standard synchrotron afterglow jet models with sideways\\nspreading, indicating either an additional energy injection at late times or\\nthe velocity dependence on the microphysics parameters. In this context, we\\ndiscuss the implications of the late time afterglow data on jet dynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T16:46:19Z\"}"}
