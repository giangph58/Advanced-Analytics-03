Although traditional centrality measures have been widely\\nused for this purpose, the growing complexity of contemporary networks\\nnecessitates more sophisticated indicators. Forman curvature has recently\\nemerged as a promising approach. In this paper, we define Forman curvature for\\nmultilayer networks, a class of complex networks characterized by multiple\\ntypes of connections or layers between nodes, which are increasingly used to\\nmodel intricate real-world phenomena. We establish the key properties of Forman\\ncurvature in the context of multilayer networks and demonstrate its utility for\\nidentifying vertices that hold central positions within these networks.\\nFurthermore, we show that Forman curvature can also serve as an effective tool\\nfor the structural classification of entire multilayer networks.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,cs.DM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T06:28:14Z\"}"}
