{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07907v1\", \"title\": \"Porting an LLM based Application from ChatGPT to an On-Premise\\n  Environment\", \"summary\": \"Given the data-intensive nature of Machine Learning (ML) systems in general,\\nand Large Language Models (LLM) in particular, using them in cloud based\\nenvironments can become a challenge due to legislation related to privacy and\\nsecurity of data. Taking such aspects into consideration implies porting the\\nLLMs to an on-premise environment, where privacy and security can be\\ncontrolled. In this paper, we study this porting process of a real-life\\napplication using ChatGPT, which runs in a public cloud, to an on-premise\\nenvironment. The application being ported is AIPA, a system that leverages\\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) and sophisticated data analytics to enhance the\\nassessment of procurement call bids. The main considerations in the porting\\nprocess include transparency of open source models and cost of hardware, which\\nare central design choices of the on-premise environment. In addition to\\npresenting the porting process, we evaluate downsides and benefits associated\\nwith porting.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T16:29:26Z\"}"}
