For instance, previous\\nstudies demonstrated that crosstalk between attacker and victim's qubits can be\\nexploited to mount security attacks.\\n  In this idea paper, we propose the QAICCC approach to allocate qubits between\\nusers to minimize inter-circuit crosstalk and, thus, possibilities for attacks,\\nwhile maximizing qubit usage. Also, combined with existing techniques, QAICCC\\naims to reduce intra-circuit noise. Thus, QAICCC will support quantum computing\\nadoption by securing the usage of quantum servers by a large number of actors.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T12:55:07Z\"}"}
