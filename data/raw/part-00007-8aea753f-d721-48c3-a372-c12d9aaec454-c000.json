{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17673v1\", \"title\": \"DTECM: Digital Twin Enabled Channel Measurement and Modeling in\\n  Terahertz Urban Macrocell\", \"summary\": \"In this work, in the THz UMa, extensive channel measurements are conducted\\nand an accurate channel model is developed by combining ray-tracing, computer\\nvision (CV), and statistical methods. Specifically, substantial channel\\nmeasurement campaigns with distances up to 410~m are conducted at 220~GHz, with\\nnanosecond-level absolute time synchronization. Based on the measurement\\nresults, the propagation phenomena are analyzed in detail and the channel\\ncharacteristics are calculated and statistically modeled. Furthermore, a\\ndigital twin enabled channel model (DTECM) is proposed, which generates THz\\nchannel responses in a hybrid manner. Specifically, the dominant paths are\\ngenerated deterministically by using the ray-tracing technique and CV methods.\\nApart from the path gains determined by ray-tracing, the additional foliage\\nloss is accurately modeled based on foliage information extracted from\\npanoramic pictures. To maintain a low computational complexity for the DTECM,\\nnon-dominant paths are then generated statistically. Numeric results reveal\\nthat compared to the traditional statistical channel models, the DTECM reduces\\nthe path loss modeling error from 14~dB to 4~dB, showing its great superiority.\\nFurthermore, a preliminary link performance evaluation using the DTECM\\nindicates that THz UMa is feasible, though requiring high antenna gains and\\ncoverage extension techniques to achieve high spectral efficiencies and wide\\ncoverage.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:40:57Z\"}"}
