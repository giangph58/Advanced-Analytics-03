{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21732v1\", \"title\": \"Hadronic tau decays\", \"summary\": \"We give a pedagogical introduction to the rich phenomenology of hadronic tau\\ndecays. These decays provide a unique window into the interplay of electroweak\\nand strong interactions at low energies, as they occur primarily via $W$\\nexchange after the electroweak quark current hadronizes. In this manuscript, we\\nsummarize the basic ingredients required to perform precision physics studies\\nin this sector. We detail the derivation of the different distributions within\\nthe Standard Model, discuss how to parametrize the non-perturbative QCD\\ndynamics, and present methods commonly used to achieve clean theoretical\\npredictions. Additionally, we briefly review how these distributions generalize\\nin the presence of relatively heavy particles from beyond the Standard Model.\\nThis overview thus aims to serve as a useful starting point for readers\\ninterested in understanding how the only lepton capable of decaying into\\nhadrons does so.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T15:22:05Z\"}"}
