{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11174v1\", \"title\": \"Algorithmic thresholds in combinatorial optimization depend on the time\\n  scaling\", \"summary\": \"In the last decades, many efforts have focused on analyzing typical-case\\nhardness in optimization and inference problems. Some recent work has pointed\\nout that polynomial algorithms exist, running with a time that grows more than\\nlinearly with the system size, which can do better than linear algorithms,\\nfinding solutions to random problems in a wider range of parameters. However, a\\ntheory for polynomial and superlinear algorithms is in general lacking. In this\\npaper, we examine the performance of the Simulated Annealing algorithm, a\\nstandard, versatile, and robust choice for solving optimization and inference\\nproblems, in the prototypical random $K$-Sat problem. For the first time, we\\nshow that the algorithmic thresholds depend on the time scaling of the\\nalgorithm with the size of the system. Indeed, one can identify not just one,\\nbut different thresholds for linear, quadratic, cubic regimes (and so on). This\\nobservation opens new directions in studying the typical case hardness in\\noptimization problems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T13:27:57Z\"}"}
