{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02235v1\", \"title\": \"On the Clustering of Conditional Mutual Information via Dissipative\\n  Dynamics\", \"summary\": \"Conditional mutual information (CMI) has recently attracted significant\\nattention as a key quantity for characterizing quantum correlations in\\nmany-body systems. While it is conjectured that CMI decays rapidly in\\nfinite-temperature Gibbs states, a complete and general proof remains elusive.\\nPrevious work addressed this problem in the high-temperature regime using\\ncluster expansion techniques [T. Kuwahara, K. Kato, F.G.S.L. Brand\\\\~ao, Phys.\\nRev. Lett. 124, 220601 (2020)]; however, flaws in the proof have been pointed\\nout, and the method does not provide a uniformly convergent expansion at\\narbitrarily high temperatures. In this work, we demonstrate that the cluster\\nexpansion approach indeed fails to converge absolutely, even at any\\nhigh-temperatures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new approach to\\nproving the spatial decay of CMI. Our method leverages the connection between\\nCMI and quantum recovery maps, specifically utilizing the Fawzi-Renner theorem.\\nWe show that such recovery maps can be realized through dissipative dynamics,\\nand by analyzing the locality properties of these dynamics, we establish the\\nexponential decay of CMI in high-temperature regimes. As a technical\\ncontribution, we also present a new result on the perturbative stability of\\nquasi-local Liouvillian dynamics. Our results indicate that, contrary to common\\nintuition, high-temperature Gibbs states can exhibit nontrivial mathematical\\nstructure, particularly when multipartite correlations such as CMI are\\nconsidered.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.stat-mech,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T03:06:55Z\"}"}
