While\\nintrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are key drivers of phase separation,\\nadditional factors such as folded domains and RNA also influence condensate\\nformation and physical properties. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying\\nthis regulation remain elusive. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations, we\\ninvestigate how the multidomain structure of TDP-43, which consists of its IDR,\\nRNA recognition motifs (RRMs), and N-terminal domain (NTD), interacts with RNA\\nand affects the characteristics of phase separation. Our analysis reveals that\\ninteraction sites within the IDR undergo dynamic rearrangement, driven by key\\nresidues that depend on the specific combination of folded domains. Upon RNA\\nbinding, several intermolecular interactions of TDP-43 are replaced by\\nTDP-43-polyA interactions, altering viscoelastic properties of the condensate.\\nSpecifically, RRMs enhance viscosity, whereas the NTD reduces it. The presence\\nof polyA increases elasticity, making viscosity and elasticity comparable in\\nmagnitude. These findings suggest that the multidomain structure of TDP-43 and\\nits RNA interactions orchestrate condensate organization, modulating their\\nviscoelastic properties.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,physics.comp-ph,q-bio.BM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T13:34:20Z\"}"}
