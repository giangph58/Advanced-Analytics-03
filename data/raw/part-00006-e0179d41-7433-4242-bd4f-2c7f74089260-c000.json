{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04551v1\", \"title\": \"Runtime Advocates: A Persona-Driven Framework for Requirements@Runtime\\n  Decision Support\", \"summary\": \"Complex systems, such as small Uncrewed Aerial Systems (sUAS) swarms\\ndispatched for emergency response, often require dynamic reconfiguration at\\nruntime under the supervision of human operators. This introduces\\nhuman-on-the-loop requirements, where evolving needs shape ongoing system\\nfunctionality and behaviors. While traditional personas support upfront, static\\nrequirements elicitation, we propose a persona-based advocate framework for\\nruntime requirements engineering to provide ethically informed, safety-driven,\\nand regulatory-aware decision support. Our approach extends standard personas\\ninto event-driven personas. When triggered by events such as adverse\\nenvironmental conditions, evolving mission state, or operational constraints,\\nthe framework updates the sUAS operator's view of the personas, ensuring\\nrelevance to current conditions. We create three key advocate personas, namely\\nSafety Controller, Ethical Governor, and Regulatory Auditor, to manage\\ntrade-offs among risk, ethical considerations, and regulatory compliance. We\\nperform a proof-of-concept validation in an emergency response scenario using\\nsUAS, showing how our advocate personas provide context-aware guidance grounded\\nin safety, regulatory, and ethical constraints. By evolving static, design-time\\npersonas into adaptive, event-driven advocates, the framework surfaces\\nmission-critical runtime requirements in response to changing conditions. These\\nrequirements shape operator decisions in real time, aligning actions with the\\noperational demands of the moment.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE,cs.HC,cs.MA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T16:31:38Z\"}"}
