We show\\nthat for any deterministic data, the probability that the corresponding\\nsolution exists globally and scatters goes to one as the strength of the\\nnon-conservative noise goes to infinity. The proof relies on the rescaling\\ntransform and a new observation on the rapid uniform decay of geometric\\nBrownian motions after short time.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T17:11:49Z\"}"}
