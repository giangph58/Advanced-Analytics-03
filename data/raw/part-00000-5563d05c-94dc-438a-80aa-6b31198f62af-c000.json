{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03239v1\", \"title\": \"Model reduction of nonlinear time-delay systems via ODE approximation\\n  and spectral submanifolds\", \"summary\": \"Time-delay dynamical systems inherently embody infinite-dimensional dynamics,\\nthereby amplifying their complexity. This aspect is especially notable in\\nnonlinear dynamical systems, which frequently defy analytical solutions and\\nnecessitate approximations or numerical methods. These requirements present\\nconsiderable challenges for the real-time simulation and analysis of their\\nnonlinear dynamics. To address these challenges, we present a model reduction\\nframework for nonlinear time-delay systems using spectral submanifolds (SSMs).\\nWe first approximate the time-delay systems as ordinary differential equations\\n(ODEs) without delay and then compute the SSMs and their associated\\nreduced-order models (ROMs) of the ODE approximations. These SSM-based ROMs\\nsuccessfully predict the nonlinear dynamical behaviors of the time-delay\\nsystems, including free and forced vibrations, and accurately identify critical\\nfeatures such as isolated branches in the forced response curves and\\nbifurcations of periodic and quasi-periodic orbits. The efficiency and accuracy\\nof the ROMs are demonstrated through examples of increasing complexity.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T07:10:00Z\"}"}
