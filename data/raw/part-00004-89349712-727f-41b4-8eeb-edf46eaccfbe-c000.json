However, stable metal oxides, like Cr$_2$O$_3$,\\nare notoriously difficult to reduce, requiring extremely high temperatures\\n(above 1300 $^\\\\circ$C). Herein, we show how reducing mixed oxides can be\\nleveraged to lower hydrogen-based reduction temperatures of stable oxides and\\nproduce alloys in a single process. Using a newly developed thermodynamic\\nframework, we predict the precise conditions (oxygen partial pressure,\\ntemperature, and oxide composition) needed for co-reduction. We showcase this\\napproach by reducing Cr$_2$O$_3$ mixed with Fe$_2$O$_3$ at 1100 $^\\\\circ$C,\\nsignificantly lowering reduction temperatures (by $\\\\geq$200 $^\\\\circ$C). Our\\nmodel and post-reduction atom probe tomography analysis elucidate that the\\ntemperature-lowering effect is driven by the lower chemical activity of Cr in\\nthe metallic phase. This strategy achieves low-temperature co-reduction of\\nmixed oxides, dramatically reducing energy consumption and CO$_2$ emissions,\\nwhile unlocking transformative pathways toward sustainable alloy design.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T13:50:13Z\"}"}
