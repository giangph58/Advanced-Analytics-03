{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21570v1\", \"title\": \"Extended self-similarity in two-dimensional complex plasmas\", \"summary\": \"Self-similarity is a property of an object or process wherein a part is\\nsimilar to the whole. Mathematically, it can often be expressed as a power-law\\nscaling of the quantity of interest. Extended self-similarity is a concept\\nwidely used in the field of turbulence and refers to the power-law scaling of\\nthe longitudinal structure functions of the velocity field expressed through\\nthe structure functions of different orders, rather than distance. Originally\\ndiscovered by [R. Benzi et al., Phys. Rev. E 48, R29 (1993)] in fully developed\\nturbulence, it was later found to hold in other situations and systems as well.\\nIn this paper, we show that in an active-matter system, extended\\nself-similarity is possible even without the presence of respective power-law\\nscaling in the underlying structure functions of distance. The active-matter\\nsystem used in this study was a single-layer suspension of active Janus\\nparticles in a plasma. Janus particles are polymer microspheres with\\nhemispherical metal coating. When dispersed in a plasma, they acquire\\nself-propulsion and act as microswimmers. Extended self-similarity was also\\nobserved in the velocity field of a single-layer suspension of laser-heated\\nregular (passive) particles, where the underlying structure functions displayed\\na hint of the power-law scaling near the mean interparticle distance.\\nTherefore, it appears to be an inherent characteristic of complex plasmas.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T12:16:30Z\"}"}
