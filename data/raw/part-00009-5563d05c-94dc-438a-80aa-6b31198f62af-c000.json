Both the\\nforward dynamics (from the forces and torques imposed at the various\\ndegrees-of-freedom to the motions of these degrees-of-freedom) or the inverse\\ndynamics (from the motions imposed at the degrees-of-freedom to the resulting\\nforces and torques) can be considered and described by a block diagram model.\\nThis work extends the Two-Input Two-Output Port (TITOP) theory by including all\\nnon-linear terms and uniform or gravitational acceleration fields. Connection\\namong different blocks is possible through the definition of the motion vector.\\nThe model of a system composed of a floating base, rigid bodies, revolute and\\nprismatic joints, working under gravity is developed to illustrate the\\nmethodology. The proposed model is validated by simulation and cross-checking\\nwith a model built using an alternative modeling tool on a scenario where the\\nnonlinear terms are determining.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T07:21:01Z\"}"}
