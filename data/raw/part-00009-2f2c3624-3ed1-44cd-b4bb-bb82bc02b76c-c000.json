{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21260v1\", \"title\": \"Power Flow Approximations for Multiphase Distribution Networks using\\n  Gaussian Processes\", \"summary\": \"Learning-based approaches are increasingly leveraged to manage and coordinate\\nthe operation of grid-edge resources in active power distribution networks.\\nAmong these, model-based techniques stand out for their superior data\\nefficiency and robustness compared to model-free methods. However, effective\\nmodel learning requires a learning-based approximator for the underlying power\\nflow model. This study extends existing work by introducing a data-driven power\\nflow method based on Gaussian Processes (GPs) to approximate the multiphase\\npower flow model, by mapping net load injections to nodal voltages. Simulation\\nresults using the IEEE 123-bus and 8500-node distribution test feeders\\ndemonstrate that the trained GP model can reliably predict the nonlinear power\\nflow solutions with minimal training data. We also conduct a comparative\\nanalysis of the training efficiency and testing performance of the proposed\\nGP-based power flow approximator against a deep neural network-based\\napproximator, highlighting the advantages of our data-efficient approach.\\nResults over realistic operating conditions show that despite an 85% reduction\\nin the training sample size (corresponding to a 92.8% improvement in training\\ntime), GP models produce a 99.9% relative reduction in mean absolute error\\ncompared to the baselines of deep neural networks.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.LG,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T02:26:31Z\"}"}
