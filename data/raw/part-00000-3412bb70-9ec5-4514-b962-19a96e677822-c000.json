{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24281v1\", \"title\": \"Cylindrical boundary induced current in the cosmic string spacetime\", \"summary\": \"In this paper we investigate the vacuum current associated with a charged\\nbosonic field operator, induced by a cylindrical boundary in the idealized\\ncosmic string spacetime. In this setup we assume that the cylindrical boundary\\nis coaxial with the string, that by its turn carry a magnetic flux along its\\ncore. In order to develop this analysis, we calculate the positive frequency\\nWightman functions for both regions, inside and outside the boundary. Moreover,\\nwe assume that the bosonic field obeys the Robin boundary condition on the\\ncylindrical shell. Using this approach, the analytical expressions for the\\nvacuum bosonic currents are presented in the form of the sum of boundary-free\\nand boundary-induced parts. Because the boundary-free contribution is very well\\nestablished in literature, our focus here is in the boundary-dependent part. As\\nwe will see, our general results are presented in a cylindrically symmetric\\nstatic structure. Some asymptotic behaviors for the boundary-induced vacuum\\ncurrents are investigated in various limiting cases. In order to provide a\\nbetter understanding of these currents, we provide some graphs exhibiting their\\nbehavior as function of the distance to the string's core, and on the intensity\\nof the magnetic flux running along it. These plots also present how the\\nparameter associated with the planar angle deficit interfere in the intensity\\nof the corresponding current.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:26:39Z\"}"}
