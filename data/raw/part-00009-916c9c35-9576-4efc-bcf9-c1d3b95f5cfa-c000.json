Characterizing the Gas Dynamics around Dust Asymmetries\", \"summary\": \"The key planet-formation processes in protoplanetary disks remain an active\\nmatter of research. One promising mechanism to radially and azimuthally trap\\nmillimeter-emitting dust grains, enabling them to concentrate and grow into\\nplanetesimals, is anticyclonic vortices. While dust observations have revealed\\ncrescent structures in several disks, observations of their kinematic\\nsignatures are still lacking. Studying the gas dynamics is, however, essential\\nto confirm the presence of a vortex and understand its dust trapping\\nproperties. In this work, we make use of the high-resolution and sensitivity\\nobservations conducted by the exoALMA large program to search for such\\nsignatures in the $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO molecular line emission of four disks\\nwith azimuthal dust asymmetries: HD 135344B, HD 143006, HD 34282, and MWC 758.\\nTo assess the vortex features, we constructed an analytical vortex model and\\nperformed hydrodynamical simulations. For the latter, we assumed two scenarios:\\na vortex triggered at the edge of a dead zone and of a gap created by a massive\\nembedded planet. These models reveal a complex kinematical morphology of the\\nvortex. When compared to the data, we find that none of the sources show a\\ndistinctive vortex signature around the dust crescents in the kinematics.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:48:14Z\"}"}
