{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05277v1\", \"title\": \"An isoperimetric inequality for twisted eigenvalues with one\\n  orthogonality constraint\", \"summary\": \"We consider twisted eigenvalues $\\\\lambda_{1}^{g}(\\\\Omega)$, defined as the\\nminimum of the Rayleigh quotient of functions in $H^1_{0}(\\\\Omega)$ that are\\northogonal to a given function $g\\\\in L^2_\\\\text{loc}(\\\\mathbb R^d)$. We prove an\\nisoperimetric inequality for $\\\\lambda_1^g(\\\\Omega)$, which provides a uniform\\nbound on twisted eigenvalues -- not only with respect to the domain $\\\\Omega$\\n(an open bounded set of $\\\\mathbb R^d$) -- but also in relation to the\\northogonality function $g$. Remarkably, the lower bound is uniquely attained\\nwhen $\\\\Omega$ is the union of two disjoint balls of specific radii, and when\\nthe function $g$ in the orthogonality constraint is of bang-bang type, i.e.,\\nconstant on each ball. As a consequence, we obtain a continuous 1-parameter\\nfamily of optimal sets -- each being the union of two disjoint balls -- that\\ninterpolates between the optimal shapes of the first two Dirichlet eigenvalues\\nof the Laplacian.\\n  This new isoperimetric inequality offers fresh perspectives on well\\nestablished results, such as the Hong-Krahn-Szeg\\\\H{o} and the Freitas-Henrot\\ninequalities. Notably, in these particular cases our proof avoids reliance on\\nBessel functions, suggesting potential extensions to nonlinear settings.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:24:49Z\"}"}
