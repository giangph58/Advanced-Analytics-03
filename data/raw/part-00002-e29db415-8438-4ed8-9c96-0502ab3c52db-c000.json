{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07721v1\", \"title\": \"From empirical brain networks towards modeling music perception -- a\\n  perspective\", \"summary\": \"This perspective article investigates how auditory stimuli influence neural\\nnetwork dynamics using the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model and empirical brain\\nconnectivity data. Results show that synchronization is sensitive to both the\\nfrequency and amplitude of auditory input, with synchronization enhanced when\\ninput frequencies align with the system's intrinsic frequencies. Increased\\nstimulus amplitude broadens the synchronization range governed by a delicate\\ninterplay involving the network's topology, the spatial location of the input,\\nand the frequency characteristics of the cortical input signals. This\\nperspective article also reveals that brain activity alternates between\\nsynchronized and desynchronized states, reflecting critical dynamics and phase\\ntransitions in neural networks. Notably, gamma-band synchronization is crucial\\nfor processing music, with coherence peaking in this frequency range. The\\nfindings emphasize the role of structural connectivity and network topology in\\nmodulating synchronization, providing insights into how music perception\\nengages brain networks. This perspective article offers a computational\\nframework for understanding neural mechanisms in music perception, with\\npotential implications for cognitive neuroscience and music psychology.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.NC\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.NC,nlin.AO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T13:13:53Z\"}"}
