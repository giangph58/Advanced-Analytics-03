Gender differences in routine tasks\\n  intensity in developing country labor markets\", \"summary\": \"Technological change can have profound impacts on the labor market. Decades\\nof research have made it clear that technological change produces winners and\\nlosers. Machines can replace some types of work that humans do, while new\\ntechnologies increase human's productivity in other types of work. For a long\\ntime, highly educated workers benefitted from increased demand for their labor\\ndue to skill-biased technological change, while the losers were concentrated at\\nthe bottom of the wage distribution (Katz and Autor, 1999; Goldin and Katz,\\n2007, 2010; Kijima, 2006). Currently, however, labor markets seem to be\\naffected by a different type of technological change, the so-called\\nroutine-biased technological change (RBTC). This chapter studies the risk of\\nautomation in developing country labor markets, with a particular focus on\\ndifferences between men and women. Given the pervasiveness of gender\\noccupational segregation, there may be important gender differences in the risk\\nof automation. Understanding these differences is important to ensure progress\\ntowards equitable development and gender inclusion in the face of new\\ntechnological advances. Our objective is to describe the gender gap in the\\nroutine task intensity of jobs in developing countries and to explore the role\\nof occupational segregation and several worker characteristics in accounting\\nfor the gender gap.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T12:19:25Z\"}"}
