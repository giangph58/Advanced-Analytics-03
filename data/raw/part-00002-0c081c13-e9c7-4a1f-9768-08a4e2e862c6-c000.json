{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12142v1\", \"title\": \"Overlapping Error Correction Codes on Two-Dimensional Structures\", \"summary\": \"The growing demand for highly reliable communication systems drives the\\nresearch and development of algorithms that identify and correct errors during\\ndata transmission and storage. This need becomes even more critical in\\nhard-to-access or sensitive systems, such as those used in space applications,\\npassenger transportation, and the financial sector. In this context, Error\\nCorrection Codes (ECCs) are essential tools for ensuring a certain level of\\nreliability. This work proposes a technique to enhance ECC error correction\\ncapability by overlapping data regions. The approach consists of protecting the\\nsame data area with multiple ECCs organized in a two-dimensional structure,\\nenabling logical inferences that correlate the codes and improve their error\\ndetection and correction capabilities. More specifically, the overlapping is\\ncharacterized by the organization of multiple ECCs, whose intersection\\nexclusively covers the entire data region. Different configurations of\\noverlapping ECCs were analyzed to evaluate the proposal regarding error\\ndetection and correction capability, scalability, and reliability. Experimental\\nresults confirm the technique's effectiveness and demonstrate its high\\nscalability potential, reducing the need for redundancy bits relative to the\\nnumber of data bits. Furthermore, comparisons with state-of-the-art ECC\\napproaches indicate the technique's applicability in critical systems that\\nrequire high reliability.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T14:53:12Z\"}"}
