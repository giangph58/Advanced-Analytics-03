{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01475v1\", \"title\": \"Optimal Control of an Interconnected SDE -Parabolic PDE System\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we design a controller for an interconnected system where a\\nlinear Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) is actuated through a linear\\nparabolic heat equation. These dynamics arise in various applications, such as\\ncoupled heat transfer systems and chemical reaction processes that are subject\\nto disturbances. Our goal is to develop a computational method for\\napproximating the controller that minimizes a quadratic cost associated with\\nthe state of the SDE component. To achieve this, we first perform a change of\\nvariables to shift the actuation inside the PDE domain and reformulate the\\nsystem as a linear Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE). We use a\\nspectral approximation of the Laplacian operator to discretize the coupled\\ndynamics into a finite-dimensional SDE and compute the optimal control for this\\napproximated system. The resulting control serves as an approximation of the\\noptimal control for the original system. We then establish the convergence of\\nthe approximated optimal control and the corresponding closed-loop dynamics to\\ntheir infinite-dimensional counterparts. Numerical simulations are provided to\\nillustrate the effectiveness of our approach.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:29:04Z\"}"}
