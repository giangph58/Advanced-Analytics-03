When instantiated with the Keccak permutation, the sponge\\nforms the NIST SHA-3 standard. SHA-3 is a core component of most post-quantum\\npublic-key cryptography schemes slated for worldwide adoption.\\n  While one can consider many security properties for the sponge, the ultimate\\none is indifferentiability from a random oracle, or simply indifferentiability.\\nThe sponge was proved indifferentiable against classical adversaries by Bertoni\\net al. in 2008. Despite significant efforts in the years since, little is known\\nabout sponge security against quantum adversaries, even for simple properties\\nlike preimage or collision resistance beyond a single round. This is primarily\\ndue to the lack of a satisfactory quantum analog of the lazy sampling technique\\nfor permutations.\\n  In this work, we develop a specialized technique that overcomes this barrier\\nin the case of the sponge. We prove that the sponge is in fact indifferentiable\\nfrom a random oracle against quantum adversaries. Our result establishes that\\nthe domain extension technique behind SHA-3 is secure in the post-quantum\\nsetting. Our indifferentiability bound for the sponge is a loose\\n$O(\\\\mathsf{poly}(q) 2^{-\\\\mathsf{min}(r, c)/4})$, but we also give bounds on\\npreimage and collision resistance that are tighter.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T17:04:25Z\"}"}
