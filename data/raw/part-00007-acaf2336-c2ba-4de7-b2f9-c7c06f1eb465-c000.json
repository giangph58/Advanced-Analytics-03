{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12868v1\", \"title\": \"Computer-Aided Design of Personalized Occlusal Positioning Splints Using\\n  Multimodal 3D Data\", \"summary\": \"Contemporary digital technology has a pivotal role in the design of\\ncustomized medical appliances, including occlusal splints used in the treatment\\nof stomatognathic system dysfunctions. We present an approach to computer-aided\\ndesign and precision assessment of positioning occlusal splints, bridging\\nclinical concepts with current digital dental practice. In our model, a 3D\\nsplint is generated based on a transformation matrix that represents the\\ntherapeutic change in mandibular position, defined by a specialist using a\\nvirtual patient model reconstructed from intraoral scans, CBCT, 3D facial scans\\nand plaster model digitisation. The paper introduces a novel method for\\ngenerating splints that accurately reproduce occlusal conditions in the\\ntherapeutic position, including a mechanism for resolving surface conflicts\\nthrough virtual embossing. We demonstrate how transformation matrices can be\\nacquired through clinical tools and intraoral devices, and evaluate the\\naccuracy of the designed and printed splints using profile and surface\\ndeviation analysis. The proposed method enables reproducible, patient-specific\\nsplint fabrication and opens new possibilities in diagnostics, multimodal image\\nregistration and quantification of occlusal discrepancies.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T11:53:49Z\"}"}
