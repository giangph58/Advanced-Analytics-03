{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15177v1\", \"title\": \"An $rp$-adaptive method for accurate resolution of shock-dominated\\n  viscous flow based on implicit shock tracking\", \"summary\": \"This work introduces an optimization-based $rp$-adaptive numerical method to\\napproximate solutions of viscous, shock-dominated flows using implicit shock\\ntracking and a high-order discontinuous Galerkin discretization on\\ntraditionally coarse grids without nonlinear stabilization (e.g., artificial\\nviscosity or limiting). The proposed method adapts implicit shock tracking\\nmethods, originally developed to align mesh faces with solution\\ndiscontinuities, to compress elements into viscous shocks and boundary layers,\\nfunctioning as a novel approach to aggressive $r$-adaptation. This form of\\n$r$-adaptation is achieved naturally as the minimizer of the enriched residual\\nwith respect to the discrete flow variables and coordinates of the nodes of the\\ngrid. Several innovations to the shock tracking optimization solver are\\nproposed to ensure sufficient mesh compression at viscous features to render\\nstabilization unnecessary, including residual weighting, step constraints and\\nmodifications, and viscosity-based continuation. Finally, $p$-adaptivity is\\nused to locally increase the polynomial degree with three clear benefits: (1)\\nlessens the mesh compression requirements near shock waves and boundary layers,\\n(2) reduces the error in regions where $r$-adaptivity is not sufficient with\\nthe given grid topology, and (3) reduces computational cost by performing a\\nmajority of the $r$-adaptivity iterations on the coarsest discretization. A\\nseries of numerical experiments show the proposed method effectively resolves\\nviscous, shock-dominated flows, including accurate prediction of heat flux\\nprofiles produced by hypersonic flow over a cylinder, and compares favorably in\\nterms of accuracy per degree of freedom to $h$-adaptation with a high-order\\ndiscretization.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA,math.OC,physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T15:39:42Z\"}"}
