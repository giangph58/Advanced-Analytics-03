We reduce seven published and one\\nunpublished VLT/SPHERE datasets in YJH and K bands, as well as an archival\\nVLT/NaCo dataset in L' band, and an archival VLT/SINFONI dataset in H+K band.\\nWe combine angular-, spectral- and reference star differential imaging to\\nsearch for protoplanet candidates. We recover the compact source in all epochs,\\nconsistent with the JWST detection, moving on an arc that can be fit by\\nKeplerian motion of a protoplanet which could be in a resonance with PDS 70 b &\\nc. We find that the spectral slope is overall consistent with the unresolved\\nstar and inner disk emission at 0.95--1.65$\\\\mu$m, which suggests a dust\\nscattering dominated spectrum. An excess beyond 2.3$\\\\mu$m could be thermal\\nemission from either a protoplanet or heated circumplanetary dust, variability,\\nor inner disk contamination, and requires confirmation. While we currently\\ncannot rule out a moving inner disk feature or a dust clump associated with an\\nunseen planet, the data supports the hypothesis of a third protoplanet in this\\nremarkable system.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T12:17:57Z\"}"}
