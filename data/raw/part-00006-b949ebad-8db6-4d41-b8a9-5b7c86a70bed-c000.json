{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07412v1\", \"title\": \"Toda-type presentations for the quantum K theory of partial flag\\n  varieties\", \"summary\": \"We prove a determinantal, Toda-type, presentation for the equivariant K\\ntheory of a partial flag variety $\\\\mathrm{Fl}(r_1, \\\\ldots, r_k;n)$. The proof\\nrelies on pushing forward the Toda presentation obtained by Maeno, Naito and\\nSagaki for the complete flag variety $\\\\mathrm{Fl}(n)$, via Kato's\\n$\\\\mathrm{K}_T(\\\\mathrm{pt})$-algebra homomorphism from the quantum K ring of\\n$\\\\mathrm{Fl}(n)$ to that of $\\\\mathrm{Fl}(r_1, \\\\ldots, r_k;n)$. Starting instead\\nfrom the Whitney presentation for $\\\\mathrm{Fl}(n)$, we show that the same\\npush-forward technique gives a recursive formula for polynomial representatives\\nof quantum K Schubert classes in any partial flag variety which do not depend\\non quantum parameters. In an appendix, we include another proof of the Toda\\npresentation for the equivariant quantum K ring of $\\\\mathrm{Fl}(n)$, following\\nAnderson, Chen, and Tseng, which is based on the fact that the $\\\\mathrm{K}$\\ntheoretic $J$-function is an eigenfunction of the finite difference Toda\\nHamiltonians.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG,math.CO,math.RT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T03:06:06Z\"}"}
