The irreversible\\nnature of the quantum trajectories that arise may be characterised by the\\nenvironmental stochastic entropy production associated with the measurement. We\\nconsider a system of two spin 1/2 particles undergoing either single particle\\nmeasurements or measurements of the total z-spin component S_{z}. The mean\\nasymptotic rates of environmental stochastic entropy production associated with\\ncollapse can depend on the eigenstate of S_{z} selected, and on the initial\\nstate of the system, offering an additional avenue for characterising quantum\\nmeasurement.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T12:25:20Z\"}"}
