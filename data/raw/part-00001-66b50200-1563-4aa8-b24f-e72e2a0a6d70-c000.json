These approaches\\noften use abstractions as finite-state Markov Decision Processes. As the state\\nspace of these MDPs grows, the curse of dimensionality makes the computational\\nand memory cost of the probabilistic guarantees, quantified with dynamic\\nprogramming, scale exponentially. In this work, we leverage decoupled dynamics\\nand unravel, via dynamic programming operations, a tree structure in the\\nCanonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) of the value functions.\\n  For discrete-time stochastic systems with syntactically co-safe linear\\ntemporal logic (scLTL) specifications, we provide provable probabilistic safety\\nguarantees and significantly alleviate the computational burden. We provide an\\ninitial validation of the theoretical results on several typical case studies\\nand showcase that the uncovered tree structure enables efficient reductions in\\nthe computational burden.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:38:09Z\"}"}
