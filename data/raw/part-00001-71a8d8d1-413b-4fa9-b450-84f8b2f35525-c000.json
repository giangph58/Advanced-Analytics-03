{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04917v1\", \"title\": \"A Simple Detector with Frame Dynamics is a Strong Tracker\", \"summary\": \"Infrared object tracking plays a crucial role in Anti-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle\\n(Anti-UAV) applications. Existing trackers often depend on cropped template\\nregions and have limited motion modeling capabilities, which pose challenges\\nwhen dealing with tiny targets. To address this, we propose a simple yet\\neffective infrared tiny-object tracker that enhances tracking performance by\\nintegrating global detection and motion-aware learning with temporal priors.\\nOur method is based on object detection and achieves significant improvements\\nthrough two key innovations. First, we introduce frame dynamics, leveraging\\nframe difference and optical flow to encode both prior target features and\\nmotion characteristics at the input level, enabling the model to better\\ndistinguish the target from background clutter. Second, we propose a trajectory\\nconstraint filtering strategy in the post-processing stage, utilizing\\nspatio-temporal priors to suppress false positives and enhance tracking\\nrobustness. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms\\nexisting approaches across multiple metrics in challenging infrared UAV\\ntracking scenarios. Notably, we achieve state-of-the-art performance in the 4th\\nAnti-UAV Challenge, securing 1st place in Track 1 and 2nd place in Track 2.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T03:16:03Z\"}"}
