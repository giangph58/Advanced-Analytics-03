{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07661v1\", \"title\": \"Unveiling the Impact of Multimodal Features on Chinese Spelling\\n  Correction: From Analysis to Design\", \"summary\": \"The Chinese Spelling Correction (CSC) task focuses on detecting and\\ncorrecting spelling errors in sentences. Current research primarily explores\\ntwo approaches: traditional multimodal pre-trained models and large language\\nmodels (LLMs). However, LLMs face limitations in CSC, particularly\\nover-correction, making them suboptimal for this task. While existing studies\\nhave investigated the use of phonetic and graphemic information in multimodal\\nCSC models, effectively leveraging these features to enhance correction\\nperformance remains a challenge. To address this, we propose the Multimodal\\nAnalysis for Character Usage (\\\\textbf{MACU}) experiment, identifying potential\\nimprovements for multimodal correctison. Based on empirical findings, we\\nintroduce \\\\textbf{NamBert}, a novel multimodal model for Chinese spelling\\ncorrection. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate NamBert's superiority\\nover SOTA methods. We also conduct a comprehensive comparison between NamBert\\nand LLMs, systematically evaluating their strengths and limitations in CSC. Our\\ncode and model are available at https://github.com/iioSnail/NamBert.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T11:19:09Z\"}"}
