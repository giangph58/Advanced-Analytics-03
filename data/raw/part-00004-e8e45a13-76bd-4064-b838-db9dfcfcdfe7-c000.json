{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12153v1\", \"title\": \"Central-Upwind Scheme for the Phase-Transition Traffic Flow Model\", \"summary\": \"Phase-transition models are an important family of non-equilibrium continuum\\ntraffic flow models, offering properties like replicating complex traffic\\nphenomena, maintaining anisotropy, and promising potentials for accommodating\\nautomated vehicles. However, their complex mathematical characteristics such as\\ndiscontinuous solution domains, pose numerical challenges and limit their\\nexploration in traffic flow theory. This paper focuses on developing a robust\\nand accurate numerical method for phase-transition traffic flow models: We\\npropose a second-order semi-discrete central-upwind scheme specifically\\ndesigned for discontinuous phase-transition models. This novel scheme\\nincorporates the projection onto appropriate flow domains, ensuring enhanced\\nhandling of discontinuities and maintaining physical consistency and accuracy.\\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme through extensive and\\nchallenging numerical tests, showcasing their potential to facilitate further\\nresearch and application in phase-transition traffic flow modeling. The ability\\nof phase-transition models to embed the ``time-gap'' -- a crucial element in\\nautomated traffic control -- as a conserved variable aligns seamlessly with the\\ncontrol logic of automated vehicles, presenting significant potential for\\nfuture applications, and the proposed numerical scheme now substantially\\nfacilitates exploring such potentials.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T15:02:14Z\"}"}
