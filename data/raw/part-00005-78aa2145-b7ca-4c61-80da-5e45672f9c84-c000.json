{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12283v1\", \"title\": \"How Accidental was Inflation?\", \"summary\": \"Data on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) are discriminating between\\ndifferent models of inflation, disfavoring simple monomial potentials whilst\\nbeing consistent with models whose predictions resemble those of the\\nStarobinsky $R + R^2$ cosmological model. However, this model may suffer from\\ntheoretical problems, since it requires a large initial field value,\\nthreatening the validity of the effective field theory. This is quantified by\\nthe Swampland Distance Conjecture, which predicts the appearance of a tower of\\nlight states associated with an effective ultra-violet cutoff. This could be\\nlower than the inflation scale for cases with an extended period of inflation,\\nleading to an additional problem of initial conditions. No-scale supergravity\\nmodels can reproduce the predictions of the Starobinsky model and accommodate\\nthe CMB data at the expense of fine-tuning of parameters at the level of\\n$10^{-5}$. Here, we propose a solution to this problem based on an explicit\\nrealisation of the Starobinsky model in string theory, where this `deformation'\\nparameter is calculable and takes a value of order of the one corresponding to\\nthe Starobinsky inflaton potential. Within this range, there are parameter\\nvalues that accommodate more easily the combination of Planck, ACT and DESI BAO\\ndata, while also restricting the range of possible inflaton field values,\\nthereby avoiding the swampland problem and predicting that the initial\\nconditions for inflation compatible with the CMB data are generic.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T17:45:53Z\"}"}
