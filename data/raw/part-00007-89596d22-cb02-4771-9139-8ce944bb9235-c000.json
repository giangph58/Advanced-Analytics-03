{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21467v1\", \"title\": \"Multiview Point Cloud Registration via Optimization in an Autoencoder\\n  Latent Space\", \"summary\": \"Point cloud rigid registration is a fundamental problem in 3D computer\\nvision. In the multiview case, we aim to find a set of 6D poses to align a set\\nof objects. Methods based on pairwise registration rely on a subsequent\\nsynchronization algorithm, which makes them poorly scalable with the number of\\nviews. Generative approaches overcome this limitation, but are based on\\nGaussian Mixture Models and use an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Hence,\\nthey are not well suited to handle large transformations. Moreover, most\\nexisting methods cannot handle high levels of degradations. In this paper, we\\nintroduce POLAR (POint cloud LAtent Registration), a multiview registration\\nmethod able to efficiently deal with a large number of views, while being\\nrobust to a high level of degradations and large initial angles. To achieve\\nthis, we transpose the registration problem into the latent space of a\\npretrained autoencoder, design a loss taking degradations into account, and\\ndevelop an efficient multistart optimization strategy. Our proposed method\\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on synthetic and real\\ndata. POLAR is available at github.com/pypolar/polar or as a standalone package\\nwhich can be installed with pip install polaregistration.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T09:42:38Z\"}"}
