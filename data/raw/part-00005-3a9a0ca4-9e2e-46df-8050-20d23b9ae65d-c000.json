{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19511v1\", \"title\": \"Novel Selection Schemes for Multi-RIS-Assisted Fluid Antenna Systems\", \"summary\": \"This paper investigates the performance of a multi-reconfigurable intelligent\\nsurface (RIS)-assisted fluid antenna system (FAS). In this system, a\\nsingle-antenna transmitter communicates with a receiver equipped with a planar\\nFAS through multiple RISs in the absence of a direct link. To enhance the\\nsystem performance, we propose two novel selection schemes: \\\\textit{Max-Max}\\nand \\\\textit{Max-Sum}. In particular, the \\\\textit{Max-Max} scheme selects the\\nbest combination of a single RIS and a single fluid antenna (FA) port that\\noffers the maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver. On the other\\nhand, the \\\\textit{Max-Sum} scheme selects one RIS while activating all FA ports\\nproviding the highest overall SNR. We conduct a detailed performance analysis\\nof the proposed system under Nakagami-$m$ fading channels. First, we derive the\\ncumulative distribution function (CDF) of the SNR for both selection schemes.\\nThe derived CDF is then used to obtain approximate theoretical expressions for\\nthe outage probability (OP) and the delay outage rate (DOR). Next, a high-SNR\\nasymptotic analysis is carried out to provide further insights into the system\\nperformance in terms of diversity and coding gains. Finally, the analytical\\nresults are validated through extensive Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating\\ntheir accuracy and providing a comprehensive understanding of the system's\\nperformance.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T06:19:39Z\"}"}
