{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12024v1\", \"title\": \"Giant Exciton Transport in hBN/2D-Perovskite Heterostructures\", \"summary\": \"Two-dimensional perovskites, such as Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites, exhibit\\noutstanding optical properties and high exciton binding energies but are highly\\nsusceptible to degradation under photo- and electron-beam exposure. To overcome\\nthis limitation, we encapsulate the perovskites with mechanically exfoliated\\nhexagonal boron nitride flakes, forming hexagonal boron nitride/perovskite\\nheterostructures. Cathodoluminescence spectroscopy reveals that these\\nheterostructures exhibit significantly reduced electron-beam-induced\\ndegradation, enhanced luminescence intensity, a narrower emission bandwidth,\\nand an extended exciton decay time. Moreover, leveraging the scanning\\ncapability of our fiber-based cathodoluminescence spectroscopy technique, we\\ndemonstrate ultra-long-range exciton transport over distances of approximately\\n150 micrometers, attributed to exciton-defect coupling. This exciton-defect\\ninteraction not only enhances luminescence but also highlights the potential of\\nhexagonal boron nitride/perovskite heterostructures as hybrid van-der-Waals\\nsystems with long-range exciton transport and slow radiative decay rates,\\npaving the way for robust and efficient optoelectronic applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T12:29:57Z\"}"}
