The weak interlayer\\nbonding in vdW layered materials enables guest atom intercalation, allowing\\nprecise tuning of their physical and chemical properties. In this work, a\\nternary compound, NixIn2Se3 (x = 0-0.3), with Ni randomly occupying the\\ninterlayers of In2Se3, was synthesized via an intercalation route driven by\\nelectron injection. The intercalated Ni atoms act as anchor points within the\\ninterlayer of In2Se3, which effectively suppresses the phase transition of\\nIn2Se3 at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, the disordered Ni intercalation\\nsignificantly enhanced the electrical conductivity of In2Se3 through electron\\ninjection, while reducing the thermal conductivity due to the interlayer phonon\\nscattering, leading to an improved thermoelectric performance. For instance,\\nthe thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of Ni0.3In2Se3 increased by 86%\\n(in-plane) and 222% (out-of-plane) compared to In2Se3 at 500 oC. These findings\\nnot only provide an effective strategy to enhance the performance of layered\\nthermoelectric materials, but also demonstrate the potential of intercalation\\nchemistry for expanding the application scope of van der Waals (vdW) layered\\nmaterials.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T10:34:23Z\"}"}
