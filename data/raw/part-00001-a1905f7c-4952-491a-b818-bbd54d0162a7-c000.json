Using a small isospin chemical\\npotential we extract the symmetry energy in the model, finding excellent\\nagreement with experimental results for some of the potentials. Extending the\\ncalculation for finite and arbitrary sized isospin chemical potentials, we\\nconstruct beta-equilibrated neutron stars via the usual\\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) equations. We find, pleasingly, that the\\nneutron stars passing the mass/radius and tidal deformability constraints are\\nthose with the potentials that also lead to excellent symmetry energies.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-th,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T14:15:12Z\"}"}
