The Cartesian Merkle Tree supports insertions, updates, and\\nremovals of elements in $O(\\\\log n)$ time, requires $n$ space, and enables\\nmembership and non-membership proofs via Merkle-based authentication paths.\\nThis structure is particularly suitable for zero-knowledge applications,\\nblockchain systems, and other protocols that require efficient and verifiable\\ndata structures.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T07:47:10Z\"}"}
