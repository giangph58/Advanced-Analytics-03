{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07917v1\", \"title\": \"SKK groups of manifolds and non-unitary invertible TQFTs\", \"summary\": \"This work considers the computation of controllable cut-and-paste groups\\n$\\\\mathrm{SKK}^{\\\\xi}_n$ of manifolds with tangential structure $\\\\xi:B_n\\\\to\\nBO_n$. To this end, we apply the work of Galatius-Madsen-Tillman-Weiss, Genauer\\nand Schommer-Pries, who showed that for a wide range of structures $\\\\xi$ these\\ngroups fit into a short exact sequence that relates them to bordism groups of\\n$\\\\xi$-manifolds with kernel generated by the disc-bounding $\\\\xi$-sphere. The\\norder of this sphere can be computed by knowing the possible values of the\\nEuler characteristic of $\\\\xi$-manifolds. We are thus led to address two key\\nquestions: the existence of $\\\\xi$-manifolds with odd Euler characteristic of a\\ngiven dimension and conditions for the exact sequence to admit a splitting. We\\nresolve these questions in a wide range of cases.\\n  $\\\\mathrm{SKK}$ groups are of interest in physics as they play a role in the\\nclassification of non-unitary invertible topological quantum field theories,\\nwhich classify anomalies and symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases of\\nmatter. Applying our topological results, we give a complete classification of\\nnon-unitary invertible topological quantum field theories in the tenfold way in\\ndimensions 1-5.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AT\", \"categories\": \"math.AT,math-ph,math.GT,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:32:26Z\"}"}
