{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01365v1\", \"title\": \"Inflation with Gauss-Bonnet correction: beyond slow-roll\", \"summary\": \"If a coupling between the inflaton and the Gauss-Bonnet term is introduced,\\nmany models of inflation that were ruled out by the most recent Planck data can\\nbe made viable again. The predictions for the scalar spectral index and\\ntensor-to-scalar ratio are typically computed using the slow-roll\\napproximation. In this paper we instead study the full equations of motion and\\ndetermine the necessary initial conditions for reasonable inflation epoch. We\\nderive the conditions under which the Friedmann equation admits positive\\nsolutions for the Hubble parameter. Then we study the possibility of the\\ninflaton becoming trapped in a local potential minimum induced by the\\nGauss-Bonnet term. Finally we demonstrate the results on monomial potential\\nmodels with a quadratic and a quartic potential and show that the slow-roll\\napproximation becomes imprecise in the quartic case.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T05:18:15Z\"}"}
