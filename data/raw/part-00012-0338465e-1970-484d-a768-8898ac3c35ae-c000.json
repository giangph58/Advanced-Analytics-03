Traditional\\ncitation metrics have limitations, and this work investigates merging large\\ncitation datasets to create a more accurate picture. Challenges of big data,\\nlike inconsistent data formats and lack of unique identifiers, are addressed\\nthrough deduplication efforts, resulting in a streamlined and reliable merged\\ndataset with over 119 million records and 1.4 billion citations. We demonstrate\\nthat merging large citation datasets builds a more accurate citation graph\\nfacilitating a more robust evaluation of scientific impact.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DL\", \"categories\": \"cs.DL\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T10:48:04Z\"}"}
