Previous theoretical\\nstudies predicted 16O + 2$\\\\alpha$ condensed states. However, in those studies,\\nthe strong mixing with non-resonant states made the identification of true\\nresonant states non-trivial. Purpose: To address this issue, we aim to provide\\na more robust theoretical verification of the 16O + 2$\\\\alpha$ condensation. Our\\ngoal is to clearly identify the resonant states and predict their properties,\\nsuch as decay widths. Method: We employ the real-time evolution method (REM),\\nwhich generates physically important basis states using the equation of motion,\\nminimizing contamination from the continuum. The analytical continuation in the\\ncoupling constant (ACCC) was used to estimate the $\\\\alpha$-decay widths.\\nResults: The present calculations show much better convergence of eigenstates,\\nand the $0^+_3$ and $0^+_4$ states showed remarkable isoscalar monopole\\ntransition strengths, which were in good agreement with the predictions of\\nIchikawa et al. The small alpha-decay widths for these states suggest that\\nexperimental observation appears feasible. Conclusion: The present results show\\nthe reasonable agreement with a previous work, firmly establishing the $0^+_3$\\nand $0^+_4$ states approximately 5 and 1 MeV below the 16O + 2$\\\\alpha$\\nthreshold as candidates for the 2$\\\\alpha$ condensation around the core nucleus\\n16O. The REM proved effective in identifying these states.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T06:25:15Z\"}"}
