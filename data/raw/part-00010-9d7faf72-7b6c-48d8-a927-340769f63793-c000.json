This research article introduces an\\ninnovative class of special polynomials, specifically the hypergeometric-Appell\\npolynomials. The fundamental attributes of this versatile family of special\\npolynomials are outlined, including generating relations, explicit\\nrepresentations, and differential recurrence relations. Certain particular\\nexamples that belong to the class of hypergeometric-Appell polynomials are also\\nconsidered. This article aims to reinforce the broad applicability of the\\numbral approach to address complex mathematical challenges and contribute to\\nvarious scientific and engineering endeavors.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CA\", \"categories\": \"math.CA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T07:12:20Z\"}"}
