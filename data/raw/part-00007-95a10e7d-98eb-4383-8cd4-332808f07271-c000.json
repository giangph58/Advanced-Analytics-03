These\\nprescriptions replace any field which appears in a test-body law of motion with\\na certain effective field which is a quasilocal functional of the physical\\nvariables -- a functional that can be interpreted as a regularization procedure\\nin a point-particle limit. We generalize these results, presenting a formalism\\nwhich allows Detweiler-Whiting prescriptions to be be directly derived for\\nextended bodies, even in nonlinear field theories. If a generating functional\\nwith particular properties can be constructed, we find effective linear and\\nangular momenta which evolve via Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations involving\\nappropriate effective fields. These equations implicitly incorporate all\\nself-force, self-torque, and extended-body effects. Although our main focus is\\non bodies coupled to nonlinear scalar fields, we also remark on the\\ngravitational case.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T09:46:04Z\"}"}
