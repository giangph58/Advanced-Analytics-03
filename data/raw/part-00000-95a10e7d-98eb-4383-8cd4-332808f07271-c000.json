In this paper,\\nwe propose a novel channel-dependent splitter design for multi-carrier RSMA\\nsystems, aimed at improving reliability performance. Specifically, the proposed\\nsplitter leverages channel state information and the inherent structure of RSMA\\nto intelligently replicate segments of the private stream data that are likely\\nto encounter deep-faded subchannels into the common stream. Thus, the\\nreliability is enhanced within the same transmission slot, minimizing the need\\nfor frequent retransmissions and thereby reducing latency. To assess the\\neffectiveness of our approach, we conduct comprehensive evaluations using key\\nperformance metrics, including achievable sum rate, average packet delay, and\\nbit error rate (BER), under both perfect and imperfect channel estimation\\nscenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T09:30:02Z\"}"}
