Owing to the rapid growth of quantum correlations\\nfollowing a quench, classical methods face significant challenges even if an\\nefficient description of the equilibrium state is available. Quantum computing\\noffers a promising alternative. However, existing approaches often assume\\naccess to the equilibrium state, which may be difficult to prepare in practice.\\nIn this work, we present a method that circumvents this by using energy filter\\ntechniques, enabling the computation of response functions and other dynamical\\nproperties in both microcanonical and canonical ensembles. Our approach only\\nrequires the preparation of states that have significant weight at the desired\\nenergy. The dynamical response functions are then reconstructed from\\nmeasurements after quenches of varying duration by classical postprocessing. We\\nillustrate the algorithm numerically by applying it to compute the dynamical\\nconductivity of a free-fermion model, which unveils the energy-dependent\\nlocalization properties of the model.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T16:52:11Z\"}"}
