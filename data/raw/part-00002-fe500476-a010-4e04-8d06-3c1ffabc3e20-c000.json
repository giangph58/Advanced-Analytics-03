Methods: We used FLAMINGOS-2 on the Gemini South telescope to\\nperform $J$-band differential photometry continuously over 4 h for each target.\\nThe resulting light curves have a cadence of 20 s and a photometric uncertainty\\nof 2-4 mmag. Results: We detect periodic variability in both T8 dwarfs, with an\\namplitude of $16.6\\\\pm0.9$ mmag and a period of $1.364\\\\pm0.012$ h for EQ\\nJ1959-3338, which we attribute to rotational modulation. For 2MASS\\nJ09393548-2448279, we observe an amplitude of $4.6\\\\pm0.4$ mmag and a period of\\n$1.733\\\\pm0.040$ h, though this periodicity could represent a fraction of a\\nlonger period. Conclusions: With the detection of variability in 2MASS\\nJ09393548-2448279 and EQ J1959-3338, the number of known variable T8 dwarfs has\\ndoubled, making them prime candidates for infrared space-based monitoring and\\nradio observations to investigate atmospheric dynamics and the influence of the\\nmagnetic field in very cool atmospheres.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.EP,physics.space-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T11:56:41Z\"}"}
