{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05212v1\", \"title\": \"HQC-NBV: A Hybrid Quantum-Classical View Planning Approach\", \"summary\": \"Efficient view planning is a fundamental challenge in computer vision and\\nrobotic perception, critical for tasks ranging from search and rescue\\noperations to autonomous navigation. While classical approaches, including\\nsampling-based and deterministic methods, have shown promise in planning camera\\nviewpoints for scene exploration, they often struggle with computational\\nscalability and solution optimality in complex settings. This study introduces\\nHQC-NBV, a hybrid quantum-classical framework for view planning that leverages\\nquantum properties to efficiently explore the parameter space while maintaining\\nrobustness and scalability. We propose a specific Hamiltonian formulation with\\nmulti-component cost terms and a parameter-centric variational ansatz with\\nbidirectional alternating entanglement patterns that capture the hierarchical\\ndependencies between viewpoint parameters. Comprehensive experiments\\ndemonstrate that quantum-specific components provide measurable performance\\nadvantages. Compared to the classical methods, our approach achieves up to\\n49.2% higher exploration efficiency across diverse environments. Our analysis\\nof entanglement architecture and coherence-preserving terms provides insights\\ninto the mechanisms of quantum advantage in robotic exploration tasks. This\\nwork represents a significant advancement in integrating quantum computing into\\nrobotic perception systems, offering a paradigm-shifting solution for various\\nrobot vision tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:05:07Z\"}"}
