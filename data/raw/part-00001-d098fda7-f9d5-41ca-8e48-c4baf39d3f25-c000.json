{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12792v1\", \"title\": \"Open Loop Layout Optimization: Feasible Path Planning and Exact\\n  Door-to-Door Distance Calculation\", \"summary\": \"The Open Loop Layout Problem (OLLP) seeks to position rectangular cells of\\nvarying dimensions on a plane without overlap, minimizing transportation costs\\ncomputed as the flow-weighted sum of pairwise distances between cells. A key\\nchallenge in OLLP is to compute accurate inter-cell distances along feasible\\npaths that avoid rectangle intersections. Existing approaches approximate\\ninter-cell distances using centroids, a simplification that can ignore physical\\nconstraints, resulting in infeasible layouts or underestimated distances. This\\nstudy proposes the first mathematical model that incorporates exact\\ndoor-to-door distances and feasible paths under the Euclidean metric, with cell\\ndoors acting as pickup and delivery points. Feasible paths between doors must\\neither follow rectangle edges as corridors or take direct, unobstructed routes.\\nTo address the NP-hardness of the problem, we present a metaheuristic framework\\nwith a novel encoding scheme that embeds exact path calculations. Experiments\\non standard benchmark instances confirm that our approach consistently\\noutperforms existing methods, delivering superior solution quality and\\npractical applicability.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T09:46:06Z\"}"}
