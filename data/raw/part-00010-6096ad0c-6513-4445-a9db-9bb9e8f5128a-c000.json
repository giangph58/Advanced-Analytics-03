{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05082v1\", \"title\": \"Entanglement Transfer in a Composite Electron-Ion-Photon System\", \"summary\": \"We study how entanglement in photoionization is transferred from an\\nelectron-ion pair to an electron-photon pair by fluorescence. Time-resolved von\\nNeumann entropies are used to establish how information is shared between the\\nparticles. Multipartite entanglement, between electron, ion and photon, is\\nfound on intermediate timescales. Finally, it is shown how a phase-locked\\ntwo-pulse sequence allows for the application of time symmetry, mediated by\\nstrong coupling, to reveal the entanglement transfer process by measuring the\\nphoton number and electron kinetic energy in coincidence.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:52:19Z\"}"}
