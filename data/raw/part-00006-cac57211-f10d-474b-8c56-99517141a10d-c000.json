Fix a\\ngenerator $\\\\Pi$ of the quadric. Define $\\\\mathcal{G}_n$ as the graph with vertex\\nset the points of $Q^+(2n+1,q)\\\\setminus \\\\Pi$ and two vertices adjacent if they\\neither span a secant to $Q^+(2n+1,q)$ or a line contained in $Q^+(2n+1,q)$\\nmeeting $\\\\Pi$ non-trivially. We show that $\\\\mathcal{G}_n$ is a strongly regular\\ngraph, that has, for $q=2$ the same parameters as the tangent graph\\n$NO^+(2n+2,2)$, but which is non-isomorphic for $n\\\\geq3$. Hence for $n \\\\geq 3$,\\nthe graphs $\\\\mathcal{G}_n$ are a putative new family of strongly regular\\ngraphs.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T08:10:00Z\"}"}
