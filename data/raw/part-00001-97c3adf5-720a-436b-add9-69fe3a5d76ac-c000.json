{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03510v1\", \"title\": \"From Neurons to Computation: Biological Reservoir Computing for Pattern\\n  Recognition\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm for reservoir computing (RC)\\nthat leverages a pool of cultured biological neurons as the reservoir\\nsubstrate, creating a biological reservoir computing (BRC). This system\\noperates similarly to an echo state network (ESN), with the key distinction\\nthat the neural activity is generated by a network of cultured neurons, rather\\nthan being modeled by traditional artificial computational units. The neuronal\\nactivity is recorded using a multi-electrode array (MEA), which enables\\nhigh-throughput recording of neural signals. In our approach, inputs are\\nintroduced into the network through a subset of the MEA electrodes, while the\\nremaining electrodes capture the resulting neural activity. This generates a\\nnonlinear mapping of the input data to a high-dimensional biological feature\\nspace, where distinguishing between data becomes more efficient and\\nstraightforward, allowing a simple linear classifier to perform pattern\\nrecognition tasks effectively. To evaluate the performance of our proposed\\nsystem, we present an experimental study that includes various input patterns,\\nsuch as positional codes, bars with different orientations, and a digit\\nrecognition task. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using biological\\nneural networks to perform tasks traditionally handled by artificial neural\\nnetworks, paving the way for further exploration of biologically-inspired\\ncomputing systems, with potential applications in neuromorphic engineering and\\nbio-hybrid computing.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NE\", \"categories\": \"cs.NE,cs.AI,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T13:20:04Z\"}"}
