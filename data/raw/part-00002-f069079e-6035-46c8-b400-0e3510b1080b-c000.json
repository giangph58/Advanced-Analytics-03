{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11853v1\", \"title\": \"Stability of Highly Hydrogenated Monolayer Graphene in Ultra-High Vacuum\\n  and in Air\", \"summary\": \"The stability of hydrogenated monolayer graphene was investigated via X-ray\\nphotoemission spectroscopy (XPS) for two different environmental conditions:\\nultra-high vacuum (UHV) and ambient pressure. The study is carried out by\\nmeasuring the C 1s line shape evolution for two hydrogenated samples one kept\\nin the UHV chamber and the other progressively exposed to air. In particular,\\nthe $sp^3$ relative intensity in the C 1s core-level spectrum, represented by\\nthe area ratio $\\\\frac{sp^3}{sp^2+sp^3}$, was used as a marker for the\\nhydrogenation-level and it resulted to vary by (4 $\\\\pm$ 2)$\\\\%$ in UHV after\\nfour months. Thus, a long-term stability of hydrogenated monolayer graphene was\\nfound, that indicates this material as a good candidate for hydrogen (or\\ntritium) storage as long as it is kept in vacuum. On the other hand, the C 1s\\nspectrum of the sample exposed to air shows a significant oxidation. A rapid\\ngrowth up to saturation of the carbon oxides was observed with a time constant\\n$\\\\tau$ = 1.8 $\\\\pm$ 0.2 hours. Finally, the re-exposure of the oxidised sample\\nto atomic hydrogen was found to be an effective method for the recovery of\\nhydrogenated graphene. This process was studied by carrying out both XPS and\\nelectron energy loss spectroscopy, the latter exploited to observe the CH\\nstretching mode as a direct footprint of re-hydrogenation.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T08:21:13Z\"}"}
