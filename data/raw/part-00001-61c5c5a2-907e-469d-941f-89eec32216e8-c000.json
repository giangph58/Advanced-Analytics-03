A BLG quantum dot (QD) in the few-particle regime acts as a\\nsensitive probe for induced SOC. Finite bias and magnetotransport spectroscopy\\nmeasurements reveal a significantly enhanced SOC that decreases with the\\napplied displacement field, distinguishing it from pristine BLG. We attribute\\nthis tunability to an increased layer localization of the QD states on the BLG\\nlayer distant to the WSe$_2$. Furthermore, our measurements demonstrate a\\nreduced valley $g$-factor at larger displacement fields, consistent with a\\nweaker lateral confinement of the QD. Our findings show evidence of the\\ninfluence of WSe$_2$ across BLG layers, driven by reduced real-space\\nconfinement and increased layer localization at higher displacement fields.\\nThis study demonstrates the electrostatic tunability of spin-orbit gap in\\nBLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures, which is especially relevant for the field of\\nspintronics and future spin qubit control in BLG QDs.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T16:59:35Z\"}"}
