However, current quantum hardware\\nis limited by noise and scale, necessitating bridging technologies. This study\\nprovides an initial evaluation of tensor network quantum emulators, narrowed to\\nmatrix product state-based emulators, for Hamiltonian simulation of\\npharmaceutical molecules, with a focus on predicting the reactivity of targeted\\ncovalent drugs. We assess runtime scaling, accuracy, and resource requirements\\nacross various active space sizes, comparing performance to traditional state\\nvector simulation methods. Our results reveal that, for accurate estimation of\\nthe expectation value trajectory of a key measurement operator - used as a\\nquantum-derived feature for reactivity prediction - the required bond dimension\\nin matrix product state tensor networks grows rapidly with system size,\\neffectively negating runtime advantages for larger, chemically relevant\\nmolecules. This study highlights the fundamental challenges in classically\\nsimulating complex quantum chemistry systems and contributes to the support of\\nthe irreplaceability premise of quantum computers to efficiently handle\\nstrongly entangled systems. Such robustness of fault-tolerant quantum computers\\nleads to practical advantages in drug discovery applications.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T17:14:01Z\"}"}
