{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11324v1\", \"title\": \"The Gaseous Prototype (GaP): a GanESS demonstrator\", \"summary\": \"The GanESS experiment will exploit the high-pressure noble gas time\\nprojection chamber technology to detect coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus\\nscattering (CE$\\\\nu$NS) at the European Spallation Source (ESS). The detector,\\nable to operate at pressures up to 50 bar with different noble gases (Xe, Ar\\nand Kr), will employ electroluminescence to amplify the ionization signal with\\nthe objective of reaching a threshold as low as 1-2 e$^-$, equivalent to $<$\\n100 eV$_{\\\\text{ee}}$. The Gaseous Prototype (GaP) has been built to\\ncharacterize the technique at the few-keV energy regime and to understand\\nvarious aspects related to the technology. Concretely, it will be used to\\nmeasure the quenching factor of the different mediums as well as to\\ncharacterize the electroluminescence yield and detection threshold under\\ndifferent operational conditions. The present paper describes the Gaseous\\nPrototype and its first results operating with gaseous argon at moderate\\npressures (up to 10 bar). A potential detection threshold lower than 2.9 keV\\nhas been observed following operation with a $^{55}$Fe calibration source.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det,hep-ex,nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:02:38Z\"}"}
