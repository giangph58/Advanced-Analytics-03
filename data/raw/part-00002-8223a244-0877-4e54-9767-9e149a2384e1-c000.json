In contrast, our method, built on a projection\\nscheme, can be applied to more general manifolds, as it only requires being\\nable to evaluate the value and the first order derivatives of the function that\\ndefines the submanifold. We provide a theoretical analysis of our method in the\\ncontinuous-time limit, which elucidates the connection between our RDDPMs and\\nscore-based generative models on manifolds. The capability of our method is\\ndemonstrated on datasets from previous studies and on new datasets sampled from\\ntwo high-dimensional manifolds, i.e. $\\\\mathrm{SO}(10)$ and the configuration\\nspace of molecular system alanine dipeptide with fixed dihedral angle.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T11:37:16Z\"}"}
