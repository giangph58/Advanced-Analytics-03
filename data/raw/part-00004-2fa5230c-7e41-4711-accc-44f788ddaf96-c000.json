The validity\\nof our results is further substantiated by examining the corrections induced by\\nthe Gauss-Bonnet term. Moreover, by comparing our results with those obtained\\nvia the ADM and Wald formulas in the Lorentz signature, we can extract some\\ngeneric information about the first order corrected black hole solutions\\ninduced by each higher derivative term.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T15:10:26Z\"}"}
