{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17748v1\", \"title\": \"Robotic Task Ambiguity Resolution via Natural Language Interaction\", \"summary\": \"Language-conditioned policies have recently gained substantial adoption in\\nrobotics as they allow users to specify tasks using natural language, making\\nthem highly versatile. While much research has focused on improving the action\\nprediction of language-conditioned policies, reasoning about task descriptions\\nhas been largely overlooked. Ambiguous task descriptions often lead to\\ndownstream policy failures due to misinterpretation by the robotic agent. To\\naddress this challenge, we introduce AmbResVLM, a novel method that grounds\\nlanguage goals in the observed scene and explicitly reasons about task\\nambiguity. We extensively evaluate its effectiveness in both simulated and\\nreal-world domains, demonstrating superior task ambiguity detection and\\nresolution compared to recent state-of-the-art baselines. Finally, real robot\\nexperiments show that our model improves the performance of downstream robot\\npolicies, increasing the average success rate from 69.6% to 97.1%. We make the\\ndata, code, and trained models publicly available at\\nhttps://ambres.cs.uni-freiburg.de.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T17:08:03Z\"}"}
