This open-source software is\\ndesigned to make it easy for users of all experience levels to learn and use\\nquantum computing. The first version includes a compiler for implementing\\nvarious quantum circuits and algorithms. Additionally, parametric circuits\\nallow for the implementation of variational quantum algorithms, and various\\nnoise models are available for simulating noisy circuits. We performed numerous\\nnumerical simulations on AriaQuanta in various applications, including quantum\\nalgorithms and noisy circuits. The results, compared with popular counterparts,\\ndemonstrate the high performance of AriaQuanta.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:27:58Z\"}"}
