{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05315v1\", \"title\": \"Scalable Chain of Thoughts via Elastic Reasoning\", \"summary\": \"Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress on complex\\ntasks by generating extended chains of thought (CoT). However, their\\nuncontrolled output lengths pose significant challenges for real-world\\ndeployment, where inference-time budgets on tokens, latency, or compute are\\nstrictly constrained. We propose Elastic Reasoning, a novel framework for\\nscalable chain of thoughts that explicitly separates reasoning into two\\nphases--thinking and solution--with independently allocated budgets. At test\\ntime, Elastic Reasoning prioritize that completeness of solution segments,\\nsignificantly improving reliability under tight resource constraints. To train\\nmodels that are robust to truncated thinking, we introduce a lightweight\\nbudget-constrained rollout strategy, integrated into GRPO, which teaches the\\nmodel to reason adaptively when the thinking process is cut short and\\ngeneralizes effectively to unseen budget constraints without additional\\ntraining. Empirical results on mathematical (AIME, MATH500) and programming\\n(LiveCodeBench, Codeforces) benchmarks demonstrate that Elastic Reasoning\\nperforms robustly under strict budget constraints, while incurring\\nsignificantly lower training cost than baseline methods. Remarkably, our\\napproach also produces more concise and efficient reasoning even in\\nunconstrained settings. Elastic Reasoning offers a principled and practical\\nsolution to the pressing challenge of controllable reasoning at scale.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:01:06Z\"}"}
