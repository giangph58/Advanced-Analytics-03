The dust continuum emission shows a ring-like structure\\ncharacterized by a dust-depleted inner region of $\\\\sim$40 au in radius.\\nConversely, the CO emission is radially smoother and shows no sign of gas\\ndepletion within the dust cavity. We compare the observations with models for\\nthe disk-planet interaction, including radiative transfer calculation in the\\ndust and CO emission. This source is particularly interesting as the presence\\nof massive planets within the dust cavity has been suggested based on previous\\nNIR observations. We find that the level of CO emission observed within the\\ndust cavity is inconsistent with the presence of planets more massive than\\nJupiter orbiting between 10-40 au. Instead, we argue that the LkCa~15 innermost\\ndust cavity might be created either by a chain of low-mass planets, or by other\\nprocesses that do not require the presence of planets.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:01:13Z\"}"}
