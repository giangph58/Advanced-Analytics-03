The generator of each copula fulfills the sufficient conditions as\\nregards the boundary and being continuous, decreasing, and convex. Each inverse\\ngenerator also fulfills the necessary conditions as regards the boundary\\nconditions, marginal uniformity, and 2-increasing properties. Although these\\ncopulas satisfy these conditions, they have some limitations. They do not cover\\nthe entire dependency spectrum, ranging from perfect negative dependency to\\nperfect positive dependency, passing through the independence state\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,math.PR,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T11:37:27Z\"}"}
