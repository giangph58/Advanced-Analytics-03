Emphasising the always verify and least privilege access,\\nsome key tenets of ZTA have grown to be integration technologies like Identity\\nManagement, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and real-time analytics. ZTA is\\nexpected to strengthen cloud environments, education, work environments\\n(including from home) while controlling other risks like lateral movement and\\ninsider threats. Despite ZTA's benefits, it comes with challenges in the form\\nof complexity, performance overhead and vulnerabilities in the control plane.\\nThese require phased implementation and continuous refinement to keep up with\\nevolving organisational needs and threat landscapes. Emerging technologies,\\nsuch as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) will further\\nautomate policy enforcement and threat detection in keeping up with dynamic\\ncyber threats.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T11:26:54Z\"}"}
