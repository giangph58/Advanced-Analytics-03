Note that the last condition is strictly weaker than local\\nhomogeneity. As a corollary we can also get a simple proof of a formula which\\nis equivalent to the one obtained earlier by the second-named author.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T13:51:18Z\"}"}
