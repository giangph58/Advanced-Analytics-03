We prove that these subalgebras exist only if $n\\\\in\\n\\\\{5,6,8\\\\}$. The case $n=5$ was already treated by Ivanov, Seress, McInroy, and\\nShpectorov. In case $n=6$ we prove that these algebras are all isomorphic and\\nprovide their precise description. In case $n=8$ we prove that these algebras\\ndo not arise from standard Majorana representations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GR\", \"categories\": \"math.GR,math.RA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T11:14:35Z\"}"}
