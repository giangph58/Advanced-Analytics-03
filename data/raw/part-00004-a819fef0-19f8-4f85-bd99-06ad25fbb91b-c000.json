{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20426v1\", \"title\": \"RV-Syn: Rational and Verifiable Mathematical Reasoning Data Synthesis\\n  based on Structured Function Library\", \"summary\": \"The advancement of reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs)\\nrequires substantial amounts of high-quality reasoning data, particularly in\\nmathematics. Existing data synthesis methods, such as data augmentation from\\nannotated training sets or direct question generation based on relevant\\nknowledge points and documents, have expanded datasets but face challenges in\\nmastering the inner logic of the problem during generation and ensuring the\\nverifiability of the solutions. To address these issues, we propose RV-Syn, a\\nnovel Rational and Verifiable mathematical Synthesis approach. RV-Syn\\nconstructs a structured mathematical operation function library based on\\ninitial seed problems and generates computational graphs as solutions by\\ncombining Python-formatted functions from this library. These graphs are then\\nback-translated into complex problems. Based on the constructed computation\\ngraph, we achieve solution-guided logic-aware problem generation. Furthermore,\\nthe executability of the computational graph ensures the verifiability of the\\nsolving process. Experimental results show that RV-Syn surpasses existing\\nsynthesis methods, including those involving human-generated problems,\\nachieving greater efficient data scaling. This approach provides a scalable\\nframework for generating high-quality reasoning datasets.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T04:42:02Z\"}"}
