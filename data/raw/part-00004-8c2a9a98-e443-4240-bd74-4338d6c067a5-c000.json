{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04866v1\", \"title\": \"Optimal Network-Guided Covariate Selection for High-Dimensional Data\\n  Integration\", \"summary\": \"When integrating datasets from different studies, it is common that they have\\ncomponents of different formats. How to combine them organically for improved\\nestimation is important and challenging. This paper investigates this problem\\nin a two-study scenario, where covariates are observed for all subjects, but\\nnetwork data is available in only one study, and response variables are\\navailable only in the other.\\n  To leverage the partially observed network information, we propose the\\nNetwork-Guided Covariate Selection (NGCS) algorithm. It integrates the spectral\\ninformation from network adjacency matrices with the Higher Criticism\\nThresholding approach for informative covariates identification. Theoretically,\\nwe prove that NGCS achieves the optimal rate in covariate selection, which is\\nthe same rate in the supervised learning setting. Furthermore, this optimality\\nis robust to network models and tuning parameters.\\n  This framework extends naturally to clustering and regression tasks, with two\\nproposed algorithms: NG-clu and NG-reg. For clustering, NG-clu accurately\\nclusters data points despite incomplete network information. For regression,\\nNG-reg enhances predictive performance by incorporating latent covariate\\nstructures inferred from network data. Empirical studies on synthetic and\\nreal-world datasets demonstrate the robustness and superior performance of our\\nalgorithms, underscoring their effectiveness in handling heterogeneous data\\nformats.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T09:21:34Z\"}"}
