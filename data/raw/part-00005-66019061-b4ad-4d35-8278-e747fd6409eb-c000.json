{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16825v1\", \"title\": \"Symbiotic stars in the era of modern ground- and space-based surveys\", \"summary\": \"Symbiotic stars, interacting binaries composed of a cool giant and a hot\\ncompact companion, exhibit complex variability across the electromagnetic\\nspectrum. Over the past decades, large-scale photometric and spectroscopic\\nsurveys from ground- and space-based observatories have significantly advanced\\ntheir discovery and characterization. These datasets have transformed the\\nsearch for new symbiotic candidates, providing extensive time-domain\\ninformation crucial for their classification and analysis. This review\\nhighlights recent observational results that have expanded the known population\\nof symbiotic stars, refined classification criteria, and enhanced our\\nunderstanding of their variability. Despite these advances, fundamental\\nquestions remain regarding their long-term evolution, mass transfer and\\naccretion processes, or their potential role as progenitors of Type Ia\\nsupernovae. With ongoing and upcoming surveys, the coming years promise new\\ndiscoveries and a more comprehensive picture of these intriguing interacting\\nsystems.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:42:19Z\"}"}
