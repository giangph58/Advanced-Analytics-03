{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16445v1\", \"title\": \"Power-based control of output oscillations with online estimation of\\n  biased harmonics\", \"summary\": \"The recently introduced discrete power-based control (Ruderman (2024b))\\nreduces largely the communication efforts in the control loop when compensating\\nfor the marginally damped or even slowly diverging output oscillations. The\\ncontrol commutates twice per oscillations period (at the amplitude peaks) and\\nuses the measured harmonic output only. The power-based control scheme requires\\nthe knowledge of the instantaneous frequency, amplitude, and bias parameters of\\nthe harmonic signal. This paper extends the power-based control by the\\nfinite-time estimation of the biased harmonics (Ahmed et al. (2022)). Also an\\nimproved analytic calculation of the impulse weighting factor is provided. The\\npower-based oscillations control with online estimation of the harmonic\\nparameters is evaluated experimentally on the fifth-order actuator system with\\na free hanging load under gravity and measurement noise.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T06:12:46Z\"}"}
