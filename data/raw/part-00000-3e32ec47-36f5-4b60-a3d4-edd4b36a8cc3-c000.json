Recently, state-of-the-art map vectorization methods are mainly based\\non DETR-like framework to generate HD maps in an end-to-end manner. In this\\npaper, we propose InteractionMap, which improves previous map vectorization\\nmethods by fully leveraging local-to-global information interaction in both\\ntime and space. Firstly, we explore enhancing DETR-like detectors by explicit\\nposition relation prior from point-level to instance-level, since map elements\\ncontain strong shape priors. Secondly, we propose a key-frame-based\\nhierarchical temporal fusion module, which interacts temporal information from\\nlocal to global. Lastly, the separate classification branch and regression\\nbranch lead to the problem of misalignment in the output distribution. We\\ninteract semantic information with geometric information by introducing a novel\\ngeometric-aware classification loss in optimization and a geometric-aware\\nmatching cost in label assignment. InteractionMap achieves state-of-the-art\\nperformance on both nuScenes and Argoverse2 benchmarks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T16:23:15Z\"}"}
