{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17732v1\", \"title\": \"DPMambaIR:All-in-One Image Restoration via Degradation-Aware Prompt\\n  State Space Model\", \"summary\": \"All-in-One image restoration aims to address multiple image degradation\\nproblems using a single model, significantly reducing training costs and\\ndeployment complexity compared to traditional methods that design dedicated\\nmodels for each degradation type. Existing approaches typically rely on\\nDegradation-specific models or coarse-grained degradation prompts to guide\\nimage restoration. However, they lack fine-grained modeling of degradation\\ninformation and face limitations in balancing multi-task conflicts. To overcome\\nthese limitations, we propose DPMambaIR, a novel All-in-One image restoration\\nframework. By integrating a Degradation-Aware Prompt State Space Model (DP-SSM)\\nand a High-Frequency Enhancement Block (HEB), DPMambaIR enables fine-grained\\nmodeling of complex degradation information and efficient global integration,\\nwhile mitigating the loss of high-frequency details caused by task competition.\\nSpecifically, the DP-SSM utilizes a pre-trained degradation extractor to\\ncapture fine-grained degradation features and dynamically incorporates them\\ninto the state space modeling process, enhancing the model's adaptability to\\ndiverse degradation types. Concurrently, the HEB supplements high-frequency\\ninformation, effectively addressing the loss of critical details, such as edges\\nand textures, in multi-task image restoration scenarios. Extensive experiments\\non a mixed dataset containing seven degradation types show that DPMambaIR\\nachieves the best performance, with 27.69dB and 0.893 in PSNR and SSIM,\\nrespectively. These results highlight the potential and superiority of\\nDPMambaIR as a unified solution for All-in-One image restoration.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,I.4.4\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T16:46:32Z\"}"}
