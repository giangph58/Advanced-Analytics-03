{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04390v1\", \"title\": \"Replica exchange nested sampling\", \"summary\": \"Nested sampling (NS) has emerged as a powerful tool for exploring\\nthermodynamic properties in materials science. However, its efficiency is often\\nhindered by the limitations of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. In\\nstrongly multimodal landscapes, MCMC struggles to traverse energy barriers,\\nleading to biased sampling and reduced accuracy. To address this issue, we\\nintroduce replica-exchange nested sampling (RENS), a novel enhancement that\\nintegrates replica-exchange moves into the NS framework. Inspired by\\nHamiltonian replica exchange methods, RENS connects independent NS simulations\\nperformed under different external conditions, facilitating ergodic sampling\\nand significantly improving computational efficiency. We demonstrate the\\neffectiveness of RENS using four test systems of increasing complexity: a\\none-dimensional toy system, periodic Lennard-Jones, the two-scale core-softened\\nJagla model and a machine learned interatomic potential for silicon. Our\\nresults show that RENS not only accelerates convergence but also allows the\\neffective handling of challenging cases where independent NS fails, thereby\\nexpanding the applicability of NS to more realistic material models.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T13:14:12Z\"}"}
