However,\\nthe interactions between the macrospin and spin waves with finite wave numbers\\nreduce the RTN attempt frequency. We theoretically show that mode-selective\\nheating and cooling can substantially tune the RTN frequency. We propose a\\nnonlinear cooling mechanism that accelerates the switching dynamics. We outline\\nexperimental pathways to characterize the physics of nonlinear effects on RTN\\nand to maximize the operation speed of MTJ-based probabilistic computing.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T14:05:08Z\"}"}
