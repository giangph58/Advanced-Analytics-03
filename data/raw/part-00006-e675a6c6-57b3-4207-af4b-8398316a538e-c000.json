This\\npaper derives surface density distributions for circumplanetary disks during\\nthe final stage of evolution when most of the mass is accreted. This approach\\ngeneralizes previous treatments to include the angular momentum bias for the\\ninfalling material, more accurate solutions for the incoming trajectories,\\ncorrections to the outer boundary condition of the circumplanetary disk, and\\nthe adjustment of newly added material as it becomes incorporated into the\\nKeplerian flow of the pre-existing disk. These generalizations lead to smaller\\ncentrifugal radii, higher column density for the surrounding envelopes, and\\nhigher disk accretion efficiency. In addition, we explore the consequences of\\ndifferent angular distributions for the incoming material at the outer\\nboundary, with the concentration of the incoming flow varying from polar to\\nisotropic to equatorial. These geometric variations modestly affect the disk\\nsurface density, but also lead to substantial modification to the location in\\nthe disk where the mass accretion rate changes sign. This paper finds analytic\\nsolutions for the orbits, source functions, surface density distributions, and\\nthe corresponding disk temperature profiles over the expanded parameter space\\noutlined above.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:45:32Z\"}"}
