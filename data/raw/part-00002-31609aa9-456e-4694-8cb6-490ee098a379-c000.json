To address these\\nlimitations, we propose an innovative dynamic RAG method, DioR (Adaptive\\nCognitive Detection and Contextual Retrieval Optimization), which consists of\\ntwo main components: adaptive cognitive detection and contextual retrieval\\noptimization, specifically designed to determine when retrieval is needed and\\nwhat to retrieve for LLMs is useful. Experimental results demonstrate that DioR\\nachieves superior performance on all tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of\\nour work.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T13:02:53Z\"}"}
