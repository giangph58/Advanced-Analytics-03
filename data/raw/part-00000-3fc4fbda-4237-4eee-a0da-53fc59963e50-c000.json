{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24264v1\", \"title\": \"Extended signatures and link concordance\", \"summary\": \"The Levine-Tristram signature admits an n-variable extension for n-component\\nlinks: it was first defined as an integer valued function on\\n$(S^1\\\\setminus\\\\{1\\\\})^n$, and recently extended to the full torus $T^n$. The aim\\nof the present article is to study and use this extended signature. First, we\\nshow that it is constant on the connected components of the complement of the\\nzero-locus of some renormalized Alexander polynomial. Then, we prove that the\\nextended signature is a concordance invariant on an explicit dense subset of\\n$T^n$. Finally, as an application, we present an infinite family of 3-component\\nlinks with the following property: these links are not concordant to their\\nmirror image, a fact that can be detected neither by the non-extended\\nsignatures, nor by the multivariable Alexander polynomial, nor by the Milnor\\ntriple linking number.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GT\", \"categories\": \"math.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:10:21Z\"}"}
