The machine only needs to be trained\\nby TCAD data. Schottky Barrier Diode (SBD) fabricated with emerging\\nultra-wide-bandgap material, Gallium Oxide (Ga$_2$O$_3$), is measured and its\\ncurrent-voltage (IV) is used for Ga$_2$O$_3$ Philips Unified Mobility (PhuMob)\\nmodel parameters, effective anode workfunction, and ambient temperature\\nextraction (7 parameters). A machine comprised of an autoencoder (AE) and a\\nneural network (NN) (AE-NN) is used. Ga$_2$O$_3$ PhuMob parameters are\\nextracted from the noisy experimental curves. TCAD simulation with the\\nextracted parameters shows that the quality of the parameters is as good as an\\nexpert's calibration at the pre-turned-on regime but not in the on-state\\nregime. By using a simple physics-informed neural network (PINN) (AE-PINN), the\\nmachine performs as well as the human expert in all regimes.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T05:09:43Z\"}"}
