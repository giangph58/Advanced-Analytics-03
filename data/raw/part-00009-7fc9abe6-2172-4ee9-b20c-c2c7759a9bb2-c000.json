The well-posedness of such problems has already been\\nstudied extensively provided that the contrast of the coefficient is\\nnon-critical. Furthermore, many different approaches have been proposed to\\nconstruct stable discretizations thereof, because naive finite element\\ndiscretizations are expected to be non-reliable in general. However, no\\nexplicit example proving the actual instability is known and numerical\\nexperiments often do not manifest instabilities in a conclusive manner. To this\\nend we construct an explicit example with a broad family of meshes for which we\\nprove that the corresponding naive finite element discretizations are unstable.\\nOn the other hand, we also provide a broad family of (non-symmetric) meshes for\\nwhich we prove that the discretizations are stable. Together, these two\\nfindings explain the results observed in numerical experiments.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T13:04:58Z\"}"}
