{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12773v1\", \"title\": \"Enhancing the Geometric Problem-Solving Ability of Multimodal LLMs via\\n  Symbolic-Neural Integration\", \"summary\": \"Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved\\nremarkable progress in general domains and demonstrated promise in multimodal\\nmathematical reasoning. However, applying MLLMs to geometry problem solving\\n(GPS) remains challenging due to lack of accurate step-by-step solution data\\nand severe hallucinations during reasoning. In this paper, we propose GeoGen, a\\npipeline that can automatically generates step-wise reasoning paths for\\ngeometry diagrams. By leveraging the precise symbolic reasoning,\\n\\\\textbf{GeoGen} produces large-scale, high-quality question-answer pairs. To\\nfurther enhance the logical reasoning ability of MLLMs, we train\\n\\\\textbf{GeoLogic}, a Large Language Model (LLM) using synthetic data generated\\nby GeoGen. Serving as a bridge between natural language and symbolic systems,\\nGeoLogic enables symbolic tools to help verifying MLLM outputs, making the\\nreasoning process more rigorous and alleviating hallucinations. Experimental\\nresults show that our approach consistently improves the performance of MLLMs,\\nachieving remarkable results on benchmarks for geometric reasoning tasks. This\\nimprovement stems from our integration of the strengths of LLMs and symbolic\\nsystems, which enables a more reliable and interpretable approach for the GPS\\ntask.
