Addressing the challenge of balancing mathematical privacy\\nguarantees with democratic accountability, we propose three key contributions:\\n(1) an adaptive $\\\\epsilon$-selection protocol leveraging TOPSIS multi-criteria\\ndecision analysis to align citizen preferences with differential privacy (DP)\\nparameters, (2) an explainable noise-injection framework featuring real-time\\nMean Absolute Error (MAE) visualizations and GPT-4-powered impact analysis, and\\n(3) an integrated legal-compliance mechanism that dynamically modulates privacy\\nbudgets based on evolving regulatory constraints. Our results advance\\nparticipatory AI practices by demonstrating how conversational interfaces can\\nenhance public engagement in algorithmic privacy mechanisms, ensuring that\\nprivacy-preserving AI in public sector governance remains both mathematically\\nrobust and democratically accountable.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,cs.AI,cs.CY,cs.ET,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T04:10:50Z\"}"}
