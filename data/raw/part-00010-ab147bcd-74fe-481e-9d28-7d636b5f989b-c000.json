We evaluate the expected\\nsensitivity of the resistivity of these binary alloys to reduced line\\ndimensions with a figure of merit that is based on generalized\\nfinite-temperature transport tensors. These transport tensors allow for a\\nstraightforward comparison between highly anisotropic intermetallics with given\\ntransport directions and Cu, and are evaluated together with their resistance\\nto electromigration. Based on the figure-of-merit analysis, we identify several\\naluminides that show potential to outperform Cu at reduced interconnect\\ndimensions in terms of their electronic transport and reliability properties.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T11:05:30Z\"}"}
