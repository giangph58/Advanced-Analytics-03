In this\\nwork, we investigate how the charged properties of particles affect the\\ntopological characteristics of circular orbits for charged test particles in\\nasymptotically flat, AdS, and dS black holes. Our findings demonstrate that the\\ncharged properties not only influence the topological properties of timelike\\ncircular orbits but also impact those of null circular orbits. Additionally, we\\nexplore scenarios involving multiple horizons and find that for a multi-horizon\\nblack hole, if a circular orbit can exist between two neighboring horizons,\\nthere will always be both a null circular orbit and a timelike circular orbit.\\nWhether these orbits are stable or unstable depends on the potential function.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:33:31Z\"}"}
