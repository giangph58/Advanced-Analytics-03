We investigate competitive adsorption in bidisperse\\npoly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) melts and find that shorter chains preferentially\\nadsorb onto nanoparticle surfaces. Experiments and molecular dynamics\\nsimulations reveal that the high density of terminal hydroxyl groups in short\\nPEG chains strengthens hydrogen bonding at the interface, driving\\nenthalpy-driven adsorption despite identical polymer backbones. This leads to a\\ndensely packed interfacial layer that alters the conformation of longer chains.\\nThese findings highlight the critical role of end-group functionality in\\ninterfacial polymer behavior and provide new insights for tailoring\\nnanocomposite properties.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:44:06Z\"}"}
