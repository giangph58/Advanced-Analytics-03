By establishing reliable\\ncross-modal representational alignment, PNBA reveals robust preserved neural\\nrepresentations in monkey primary motor cortex (M1) and dorsal premotor cortex\\n(PMd) through zero-shot validation. We further establish similar\\nrepresentational preservation in mouse primary visual cortex (V1), reflecting a\\ngeneral neural basis. These findings resolve the paradox of neural\\nheterogeneity by establishing zero-shot preserved neural representations across\\ncortices and species, enriching neural coding insights and enabling zero-shot\\nbehavior decoding.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.NC\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.NC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T11:28:03Z\"}"}
