{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14853v1\", \"title\": \"Output regulation for an unstable wave equation with output delay and\\n  one measurement only\", \"summary\": \"This paper addresses the output regulation problem for a one-dimensional\\nunstable wave equation subject to output delay and all-channel disturbances\\nwith unknown frequencies and amplitudes. First, this problem is transformed\\ninto a stabilization problem for an unstable wave equation with output delay\\nand disturbances by employing regulator equations. Subsequently, a\\nbackstepping-based feedforward regulator is proposed to exponentially stabilize\\nthis system. To track the states of the unstable wave equation, the time\\ninterval is partitioned into two segments. The observers and predictors are\\ndesigned at these distinct intervals, respectively. Therein, the observers\\ncomprise two components: a state observer proposed via dynamic compensators and\\nan adaptive observer designed by the adaptive internal model method. Finally, a\\nnovel error-based feedback controller is derived using a single measurement,\\nensuring exponential convergence of the tracking error to zero. This work\\nestablishes the pioneering solution to the output regulation problem for\\ndistributed parameter systems (DPS) with output delay. Numerical simulations\\nare provided to illustrate the results.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T04:35:56Z\"}"}
