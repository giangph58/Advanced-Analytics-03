To this end, we use the\\ntangent functor in the sense of Blohmann and one of the options of a metric on\\na diffeological space in the sense of Iglesias-Zemmour. With a technical\\ncondition for a definite Riemannian metric, we show that the psudodistance\\ninduced by the metric is indeed a distance. As examples of Riemannian\\ndiffeological spaces, an adjunction space of manifolds, a space of smooth maps\\nand the mixed one are considered.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG,math.CT,math.GT,math.MG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T06:49:02Z\"}"}
