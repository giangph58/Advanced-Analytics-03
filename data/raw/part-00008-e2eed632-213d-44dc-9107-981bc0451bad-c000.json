{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16874v1\", \"title\": \"Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Control for a Moving Receiver\", \"summary\": \"Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are emerging as key enablers of\\nreliable industrial automation in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band,\\nparticularly in environments with frequent line-of-sight (LoS) blockage. While\\nprior works have largely focused on theoretical aspects, real-time validation\\nunder user mobility remains underexplored. In this work, we propose and\\nexperimentally evaluate a self-adaptive beamforming algorithm that enables RIS\\nreconfiguration based on a low-rate feedback link from the mobile user\\nequipment (UE) to the RIS controller. The algorithm maintains received signal\\npower above a predefined threshold without requiring UE position knowledge.\\nUsing a hexagonal RIS with 127 elements operating at 23.8 GHz, we validate our\\napproach in a semi-anechoic environment over a 60 cm*100 cm observation area.\\nThe results demonstrate up to 24 dB gain in received power compared to the\\nbaseline with inactive RIS elements, highlighting the practical benefits of\\nadaptive RIS control in mobile non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T16:50:40Z\"}"}
