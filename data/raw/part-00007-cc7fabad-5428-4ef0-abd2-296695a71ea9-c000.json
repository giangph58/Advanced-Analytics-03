I show that this explanation does not work because P9 can at most\\nprovide an insignificant 0.25 km/s of the object's 42 km/s asymptotic\\nheliocentric velocity and at most a 7.6 degree deflection due to P9's low\\norbital speed and non-zero radius. Furthermore, the hypothesis requires an\\nencounter with two planets that is trillions of times more unlikely than CNEOS\\n2014-01-08 simply being fast from the beginning.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T17:54:22Z\"}"}
