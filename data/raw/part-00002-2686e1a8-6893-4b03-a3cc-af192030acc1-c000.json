{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11067v1\", \"title\": \"Morphing-based Compression for Data-centric ML Pipelines\", \"summary\": \"Data-centric ML pipelines extend traditional machine learning (ML) pipelines\\n-- of feature transformations and ML model training -- by outer loops for data\\ncleaning, augmentation, and feature engineering to create high-quality input\\ndata. Existing lossless matrix compression applies lightweight compression\\nschemes to numeric matrices and performs linear algebra operations such as\\nmatrix-vector multiplications directly on the compressed representation but\\nstruggles to efficiently rediscover structural data redundancy. Compressed\\noperations are effective at fitting data in available memory, reducing I/O\\nacross the storage-memory-cache hierarchy, and improving instruction\\nparallelism. The applied data cleaning, augmentation, and feature\\ntransformations provide a rich source of information about data characteristics\\nsuch as distinct items, column sparsity, and column correlations. In this\\npaper, we introduce BWARE -- an extension of AWARE for workload-aware lossless\\nmatrix compression -- that pushes compression through feature transformations\\nand engineering to leverage information about structural transformations.\\nBesides compressed feature transformations, we introduce a novel technique for\\nlightweight morphing of a compressed representation into workload-optimized\\ncompressed representations without decompression. BWARE shows substantial\\nend-to-end runtime improvements, reducing the execution time for training\\ndata-centric ML pipelines from days to hours.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DB\", \"categories\": \"cs.DB,cs.DC,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T11:02:34Z\"}"}
