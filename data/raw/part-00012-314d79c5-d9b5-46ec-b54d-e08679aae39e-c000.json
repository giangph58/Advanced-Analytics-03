We give an\\nalgebro-geometric formulation of the spectral problem for the periodic TASEP\\nwith arbitrary numbers of sites and particles, in which the Bethe ansatz\\nequations are realized as an algebraic equation on a certain Riemann surface.\\nWhile our Riemann surface is essentially the same as the one introduced by\\nProlhac, we focus on its algebraic realization as a (singular) plane curve. By\\na counting argument on the Riemann surface, we give a rigorous proof of the\\ncompleteness of the Bethe ansatz. The decomposition of the Riemann surface into\\nconnected components determines how often each value of the product of Bethe\\nroots appears. We classify the connected components and their multiplicities\\nusing a similar argument to the spectral degeneracy of the eigenvalues of the\\nMarkov matrix discussed by Golinelli-Mallick. We also give explicit formulas\\nfor the number of connected components, the number of ramification points, and\\nthe total genus of the Riemann surface. The formulas recover the table of\\nexamples presented by Prolhac. Moreover, we explore applications of the special\\ntype of Bethe roots that appear in this case to partition functions of the\\nfive-vertex model. We introduce a version of the free energy and evaluate the\\nthermodynamic limit to find the explicit form in terms of the Riemann zeta\\nfunctions.\", \"main_category\": \"math-ph\", \"categories\": \"math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T11:35:58Z\"}"}
