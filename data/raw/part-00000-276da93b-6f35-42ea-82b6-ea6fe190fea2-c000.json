Such\\n$s$-invariants have already been studied by Lobb and Wu in characteristic 0 and\\nwe show how to extend this to other characteristics, particularly to $p=3$. We\\nalso use Bar-Natan's scanning algorithm for efficient calculations of these\\ninvariants, and exhibit more examples of unusual behaviour that has been\\npreviously observed by Lewark-Lobb.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GT\", \"categories\": \"math.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:43:13Z\"}"}
