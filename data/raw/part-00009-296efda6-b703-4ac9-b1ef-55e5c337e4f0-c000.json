{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05380v1\", \"title\": \"Scalable Quantum Architecture Search via Landscape Analysis\", \"summary\": \"Balancing trainability and expressibility is a central challenge in\\nvariational quantum computing, and quantum architecture search (QAS) plays a\\npivotal role by automatically designing problem-specific parameterized circuits\\nthat address this trade-off. In this work, we introduce a scalable,\\ntraining-free QAS framework that efficiently explores and evaluates quantum\\ncircuits through landscape fluctuation analysis. This analysis captures key\\ncharacteristics of the cost function landscape, enabling accurate prediction of\\ncircuit learnability without costly training. By combining this metric with a\\nstreamlined two-level search strategy, our approach identifies\\nhigh-performance, large-scale circuits with higher accuracy and fewer gates. We\\nfurther demonstrate the practicality and scalability of our method, achieving\\nsignificantly lower classical resource consumption compared to prior work.\\nNotably, our framework attains robust performance on a challenging 50-qubit\\nquantum many-body simulation, highlighting its potential for addressing complex\\nquantum problems.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T16:13:23Z\"}"}
