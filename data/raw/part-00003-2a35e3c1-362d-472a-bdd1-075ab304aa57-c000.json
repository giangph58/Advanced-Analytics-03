PQoS incorporates data-driven techniques, such as Machine Learning\\n(ML), to forecast/predict Key Performing Indicators (KPIs) such as throughput,\\nlatency, etc. In this paper, we aim to predict downlink throughput in an urban\\nenvironment using the Berlin V2X cellular dataset. We select features from the\\nego and lead vehicles to train different ML models to help improve the\\npredicted throughput for the ego vehicle. We identify these features based on\\nan in-depth exploratory data analysis. Results show an improvement in model\\nperformance when adding features from the lead vehicle. Moreover, we show that\\nthe improvement in model performance is model-agnostic.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T16:10:31Z\"}"}
