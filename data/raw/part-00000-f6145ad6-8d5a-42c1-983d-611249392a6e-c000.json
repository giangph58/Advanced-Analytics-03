With the assumption that the nuclear surface deformation\\ninduced by the multi-nucleon dynamics is simulated by bosonic degrees of\\nfreedom, the interacting-boson Hamiltonian that provides energy spectra and\\nwave functions is determined by mapping the potential energy surface that is\\nobtained from self-consistent mean-field calculations based on the energy\\ndensity functional onto the corresponding energy surface of the boson system.\\nThis procedure has been shown to be valid in general cases of the quadrupole\\ncollective states, and has allowed for systematic studies on spectroscopic\\nproperties of medium-heavy and heavy nuclei, including those that are far from\\nthe line of $\\\\beta$ stability. The method is extended to study intriguing\\nnuclear structure phenomena that include shape phase transitions and\\ncoexistence, octupole deformation and collectivity, and the coupling of the\\nsingle-particle to collective degrees of freedom, which is crucial to describe\\nstructures of odd nuclei, and $\\\\beta$ and $\\\\beta\\\\beta$ decays.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T06:42:58Z\"}"}
