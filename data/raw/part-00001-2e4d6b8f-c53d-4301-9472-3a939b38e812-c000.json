Motivated by these\\ntensions, we perform a comprehensive joint analysis of three representative\\ndark energy models - ${\\\\rm{\\\\Lambda}CDM}$, the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL)\\nparametrization, and the Phenomenologically Emergent Dark Energy (PEDE) model -\\nusing the latest observational datasets: baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO)\\nmeasurements from DESI Data Releases 1 and 2 (DR1/DR2), the Pantheon Plus\\nsample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), and time-delay cosmography from TDCOSMO\\nlensing. Our multi-probe approach breaks key degeneracies among cosmological\\nparameters ($H_0$, $r_d$, and $M_B$) and provides robust constraints on dark\\nenergy dynamics. The CPL model yields a statistically significant improvement\\nover ${\\\\rm{\\\\Lambda}CDM}$, with $\\\\Delta \\\\chi^2 \\\\approx -3.6$ for DESI\\nDR2+Pantheon Plus+TDCOSMO, favoring a quintessence-like behavior\\n($w_0=-0.87^{+0.045 }_{-0.045} $, $w_a=-0.41^{+ 0.28}_{-0.28}$ at 1$\\\\sigma$\\nconfidence level). In contrast, the PEDE model exhibits severe tension with\\nobservations, yielding $\\\\Delta \\\\chi^2 \\\\approx +53.1$ (DR1) and $\\\\Delta \\\\chi^2\\n\\\\approx +132.3$ (DR2), despite its potential to marginally alleviate the $H_0$\\ntension. DESI DR2 tightens constraints on dynamical dark energy by $\\\\sim$40\\\\%,\\nreinforcing evidence for redshift-evolving $w(z)$. Remarkably, our results\\ndemonstrate that such data combination can achieve precision comparable to\\nPlanck CMB measurements for dynamical dark energy studies, while offering\\ncomplementary advantages in probing the late-time universe. This synergy\\nbetween different observational data significantly enhances our ability to\\nconstrain dark energy properties.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T07:12:27Z\"}"}
