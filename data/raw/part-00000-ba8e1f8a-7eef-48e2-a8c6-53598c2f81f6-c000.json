{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06990v1\", \"title\": \"Enhancing TiFe Alloy Activation for Hydrogen Storage Through Al, Cr, Co,\\n  and Cu Substitutions as a Step Towards Future Recycling\", \"summary\": \"This study investigates the activation behavior of $TiFe_{0.80}$-$X_{0.20}$\\n(X = Co, Cu, Cr, Al) alloys to identify the most effective materials for\\nproducing hydrogen storage alloys from recycled sources in view of a circular\\neconomy perspective. Activation was tested using two methods: a Sievert\\nVolumetric Apparatus at room temperature and 64 bar of hydrogen, and\\nhigh-pressure differential scanning calorimetry with 50 bar hydrogen under\\nthermal cycles up to 400 {\\\\deg}C. Activation properties were analyzed by\\nassessing time for incubation and for full charging, that are influenced,\\nrespectively, by surface and bulk diffusion of hydrogen. Results showed that\\nCr-substituted alloys are rapidly activated, due to the presence of $TiCr_{2}$\\ncompound, while Al-containing alloys absorbed hydrogen immediately. In\\ncontrast, Co- and Cu-substituted alloys required extended activation times, due\\nto less quantity of secondary phases and limited diffusion channels.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T15:57:51Z\"}"}
