The tool models UAV collaboration and mission execution in\\ndynamic and adversarial conditions, where Byzantine UAVs attempt to disrupt\\noperations. Our tool allows researchers to integrate and compare various team\\nformation strategies in a controlled environment with configurable mission\\nparameters and adversarial behaviors. The log of each simulation run is stored\\nin a structured way along with performance metrics so that statistical analysis\\ncould be done straightforwardly. The tool is versatile for testing and\\nimproving UAV coordination strategies in real-world applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI,cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T08:36:22Z\"}"}
