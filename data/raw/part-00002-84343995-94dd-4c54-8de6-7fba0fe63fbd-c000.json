In this work,\\nwe unveil diverse scalings of the quantum geometry over the ground state\\nmanifold close to different topological phase transitions in a non-Hermitian\\nlong-range extension of the Kitaev chain. The derivative of the geometric\\nphase, as well as its scaling behavior, shows that systems with different\\nlong-range couplings can belong to distinct universality classes. Near certain\\ncriticalities, we further find that the Wannier state correlation function\\nassociated with extended Berry connection of the ground state exhibits\\nspatially anomalous behaviors. Finally, we analyze the scaling of the quantum\\ngeometric tensor near phase transitions across exceptional points, shedding\\nlight on the emergence of novel universality classes.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.stat-mech,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T03:56:48Z\"}"}
