However, there is currently no publicly available dataset\\nspecifically dedicated to problematic maps the CME dataset. Existing datasets\\nprimarily focus on general map data and are insufficient for effectively\\nidentifying complex issues such as national boundary misrepresentations,\\nmissing elements, and blurred boundaries. Therefore, this study creates a\\nProblematic Map dataset that covers five key problem areas, aiming to provide\\ndiverse samples for problematic map detection technologies, support\\nhigh-precision map compliance detection, and enhance map data quality and\\ntimeliness. This dataset not only provides essential resources for map\\ncompliance, national security monitoring, and map updates, but also fosters\\ninnovation and application of related technologies.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T06:04:16Z\"}"}
