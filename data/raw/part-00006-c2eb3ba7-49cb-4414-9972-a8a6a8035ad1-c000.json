{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21489v1\", \"title\": \"TRIED: Truly Innovative and Effective Detection Benchmark, developed by\\n  WITNESS\", \"summary\": \"The rise of generative AI and deceptive synthetic media threatens the global\\ninformation ecosystem, especially across the Global Majority. This report from\\nWITNESS highlights the limitations of current AI detection tools, which often\\nunderperform in real-world scenarios due to challenges related to\\nexplainability, fairness, accessibility, and contextual relevance. In response,\\nWITNESS introduces the Truly Innovative and Effective AI Detection (TRIED)\\nBenchmark, a new framework for evaluating detection tools based on their\\nreal-world impact and capacity for innovation. Drawing on frontline\\nexperiences, deceptive AI cases, and global consultations, the report outlines\\nhow detection tools must evolve to become truly innovative and relevant by\\nmeeting diverse linguistic, cultural, and technological contexts. It offers\\npractical guidance for developers, policymakers, and standards bodies to design\\naccountable, transparent, and user-centered detection solutions, and\\nincorporate sociotechnical considerations into future AI standards, procedures\\nand evaluation frameworks. By adopting the TRIED Benchmark, stakeholders can\\ndrive innovation, safeguard public trust, strengthen AI literacy, and\\ncontribute to a more resilient global information credibility.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T10:18:19Z\"}"}
