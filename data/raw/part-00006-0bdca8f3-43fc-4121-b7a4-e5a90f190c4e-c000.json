One design goal of the system is the\\ninclusion of a command line based configuration system for setting up\\nexperiments. The possible options are derived using well-known Python packages\\nand presented to the user intuitively, allowing the configuration of repeatable\\nvariational quantum optimization experiments. We give an example of using the\\nsystem through the Airline Crew Pairing problem, a highly relevant industrial\\nproblem, and the MaxCut problem, for which instances of manageable size are\\nreadily available.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T09:25:50Z\"}"}
