The representation is found as a solution of\\nan optimization problem. Different target functionals are considered, with a\\nfocus on sparsity-promoting regularization terms. The proposed algorithm\\nguarantees non-negativity of the distribution by construction, and avoids an\\nexponential dependence of the computational cost on the dimensionality of the\\nproblem.\\n  Numerical comparisons with other classical methods for reconstruction of\\nkinetic distributions are provided for model problems, and the role of the\\ndifferent parameters governing the optimization problem is studied.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:19:27Z\"}"}
