{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20007v1\", \"title\": \"Towards AI-Driven Policing: Interdisciplinary Knowledge Discovery from\\n  Police Body-Worn Camera Footage\", \"summary\": \"This paper proposes a novel interdisciplinary framework for analyzing police\\nbody-worn camera (BWC) footage from the Rochester Police Department (RPD) using\\nadvanced artificial intelligence (AI) and statistical machine learning (ML)\\ntechniques. Our goal is to detect, classify, and analyze patterns of\\ninteraction between police officers and civilians to identify key behavioral\\ndynamics, such as respect, disrespect, escalation, and de-escalation. We apply\\nmultimodal data analysis by integrating video, audio, and natural language\\nprocessing (NLP) techniques to extract meaningful insights from BWC footage. We\\npresent our methodology, computational techniques, and findings, outlining a\\npractical approach for law enforcement while advancing the frontiers of\\nknowledge discovery from police BWC data.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:25:23Z\"}"}
