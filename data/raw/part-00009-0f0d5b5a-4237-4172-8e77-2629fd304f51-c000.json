{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16728v1\", \"title\": \"IRIS: Interactive Research Ideation System for Accelerating Scientific\\n  Discovery\", \"summary\": \"The rapid advancement in capabilities of large language models (LLMs) raises\\na pivotal question: How can LLMs accelerate scientific discovery? This work\\ntackles the crucial first stage of research, generating novel hypotheses. While\\nrecent work on automated hypothesis generation focuses on multi-agent\\nframeworks and extending test-time compute, none of the approaches effectively\\nincorporate transparency and steerability through a synergistic\\nHuman-in-the-loop (HITL) approach. To address this gap, we introduce IRIS:\\nInteractive Research Ideation System, an open-source platform designed for\\nresearchers to leverage LLM-assisted scientific ideation. IRIS incorporates\\ninnovative features to enhance ideation, including adaptive test-time compute\\nexpansion via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), fine-grained feedback mechanism,\\nand query-based literature synthesis. Designed to empower researchers with\\ngreater control and insight throughout the ideation process. We additionally\\nconduct a user study with researchers across diverse disciplines, validating\\nthe effectiveness of our system in enhancing ideation. We open-source our code\\nat https://github.com/Anikethh/IRIS-Interactive-Research-Ideation-System\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T14:01:36Z\"}"}
