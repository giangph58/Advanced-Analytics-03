Cooling to sub-kelvin\\ntemperatures can significantly enhance their coherence, making it essential to\\nidentify the key parameters governing emitter and host crystal behavior in this\\nultra cold regime. We investigate a Czochralski-grown europium doped yttrium\\northosilicate crystal, and we report measurements of the heat capacity, a\\nparameter fundamental to evaluating thermal noise limits in metrology schemes\\nbased on spectral hole stabilization in such samples. In parallel, we\\ncharacterize optical coherence via photon echo measurements as a function of\\ntemperature. Below 1 K, where phonon contributions diminish, two-level systems\\n(TLS) associated with crystal imperfections may emerge as a limiting factor. A\\nlinear-in-temperature term in the heat capacity serves as a signature of TLS,\\nand from our data, we establish an upper bound on this contribution. This,\\ncombined with the optical homogeneous linewidth from photon-echo measurements\\nbeing constant in the interval from 300 mK to 2 K demonstrates a minimal\\nTLSrelated effects in our sample. These findings highlight the promise of\\nultralow-temperature operation for enhancing the performance of optical quantum\\ndevices based on doped crystals.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T08:27:58Z\"}"}
