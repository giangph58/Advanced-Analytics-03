In the research of radio astronomy, pulsars have always been an\\nenduring popular research target. To find and observe more pulsars, large radio\\ntelescopes have been built all over the world. In this paper, we present our\\nstudies on pulsars in M15 and NGC 6517 with FAST, including monitoring pulsars\\nin M15 and new pulsar discoveries in NGC 6517. All the previously known pulsars\\nin M15 were detected without no new discoveries. Among them, M15C was still\\ndetectable by FAST, while it is assumed to fade out due to precession [1]. In\\nNGC 6517, new pulsars were continues to be discovered and all of them are tend\\nto be isolated pulsars. Currently, the number of pulsars in NGC 6517 is 17,\\nmuch more than the predicted before [2].\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T12:10:04Z\"}"}
