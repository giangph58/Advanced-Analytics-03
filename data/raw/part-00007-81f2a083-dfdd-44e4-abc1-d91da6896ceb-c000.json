{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15184v1\", \"title\": \"Wave Arithmetic: A Smooth Integral Representation of Number Theory\", \"summary\": \"We introduce Wave Arithmetic, a smooth analytical framework in which natural,\\ninteger, and rational numbers are represented not as discrete entities, but as\\nintegrals of smooth, compactly supported or periodic kernel functions. In this\\nformulation, each number arises as the accumulated amplitude of a structured\\nwaveform -- an interference pattern encoded by carefully designed kernels.\\nArithmetic operations such as addition, multiplication, and exponentiation are\\nrealized as geometric and tensorial constructions over multidimensional\\nintegration domains. Rational numbers emerge through amplitude scaling, and\\nnegative values through sign inversion, preserving all classical arithmetic\\nidentities within a continuous and differentiable structure. This\\nrepresentation embeds number theory into the realm of smooth analysis, enabling\\nnew interpretations of primality, factorization, and divisibility as geometric\\nand spectral phenomena. Beyond technical formulation, Wave Arithmetic proposes\\na paradigm shift: numbers as the collapsed states of harmonic processes --\\nanalytic resonances rather than atomic symbols.\", \"main_category\": \"math.LO\", \"categories\": \"math.LO,math.NT,F.4.1\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T15:46:44Z\"}"}
