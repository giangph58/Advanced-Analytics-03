However, the role of\\nnonsymmorphic symmetry, crystalline symmetry accompanying fractional lattice\\ntranslations, has remained largely unexplored. Here, we systematically classify\\nnon-Hermitian topological crystalline phases protected by nonsymmorphic\\nsymmetry and reveal unique phases that have no counterparts in either Hermitian\\ntopological crystalline phases or non-Hermitian topological phases protected\\nsolely by internal symmetry. Specifically, we elucidate the $\\\\mathbb{Z}_2$ and\\n$\\\\mathbb{Z}_4$ non-Hermitian topological phases and their associated anomalous\\nboundary states characterized by distinctive complex-valued energy dispersions.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,math-ph,math.MP,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:24:24Z\"}"}
