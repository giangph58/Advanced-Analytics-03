{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12070v1\", \"title\": \"A Light Lepton-flavor-violating Flavon: the Messenger of Neutrino Mixing\\n  and Muon $g-2$\", \"summary\": \"In neutrino physics, a class of models with local or global family symmetries\\nmay be invoked, and then a flavon field is needed to realize the full neutrino\\nmixing. This flavon may shed light on the long-standing muon $g-2$ puzzle. In\\nthis work, we explore this idea in the $({B-L})_{13}$ gauge extension to the\\nstandard model (SM), in which realistic neutrino mixing requires both a SM\\nsinglet flavon $s$ and a vector-like lepton (VLL) doublet. The dominant\\ncoupling between the flavon and leptons is in the manner of\\nlepton-flavor-violation (LFV). Through an analytical analysis of the SM\\nlepton-VLL mixing matrix, we find that the parameter space of the $s\\\\bar\\\\mu\\ne$-type flavon to explain the muon $g-2$ has been completely excluded by the\\nspecific LFV process, muonium-antimuonium oscillation. But the $s\\\\bar\\\\mu\\n\\\\tau$-type flavon still has the opportunity; however, it confronts the strong\\nconstraint from $\\\\tau\\\\to \\\\mu$ conservation and, in particular, the lepton\\nflavor universality test of $Z$ boson decay, which arises due to our way to\\nrealize the LFV flavon. The surviving flavon is highly predictable, with mass\\nin the narrow window $m_\\\\tau\\\\lesssim m_s\\\\lesssim 1.5~ m_\\\\tau$ and LFV coupling\\nstrength $\\\\sim 10^{-2}$. Besides, it leaves a TeV scale VLL with a multi-lepton\\nsignature at the LHC.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T13:25:54Z\"}"}
