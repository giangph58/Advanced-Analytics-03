This behavior stands in\\nstark contrast with the performance of existing estimators, including those\\nbased on entropic regularization, which are asymptotically biased and only\\nsatisfy a CLT centered at a regularized version of the population-level plan.\\nWe develop a new regularization approach based on a different class of penalty\\nfunctions, which can be viewed as the duals of those previously considered in\\nthe literature. The key feature of these penalty schemes it that they give rise\\nto preliminary estimates that are asymptotically linear in the penalization\\nstrength. Our final estimator is obtained by constructing an appropriate linear\\ncombination of two penalized solutions corresponding to two different tuning\\nparameters so that the bias introduced by the penalization cancels out. Unlike\\nclassical debiasing procedures, therefore, our proposal entirely avoids the\\ndelicate problem of estimating and then subtracting the estimated bias term.\\nOur proofs, which apply beyond the case of optimal transport, are based on a\\nnovel asymptotic analysis of penalization schemes for linear programs. As a\\ncorollary of our results, we obtain the consistency of the naive bootstrap for\\nfully data-driven inference on the true optimal solution. Simulation results\\nand two data analyses support strongly the benefits of our approach relative to\\nexisting techniques.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T10:55:14Z\"}"}
