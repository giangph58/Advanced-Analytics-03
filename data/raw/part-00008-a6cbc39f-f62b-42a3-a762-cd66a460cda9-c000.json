Motivated\\nby these insights, we propose a reinforcement learning-based approach that\\ndynamically selects the best serialization-prompt pairings, resulting in\\nsignificant accuracy improvements. GraphOmni's modular and extensible design\\nestablishes a robust foundation for future research, facilitating advancements\\ntoward general-purpose graph reasoning models.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.DM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T09:01:16Z\"}"}
