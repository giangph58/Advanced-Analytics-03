After identifying the reproducing kernel of $H$, we\\ndiscover an unexpected phenomenon about the decay of the eigenvalues of a\\ntwo-sided concentration operator, namely that the plunge region is of the same\\norder of magnitude as the region where the eigenvalues are close to 1,\\ncontrasting the classical case of Paley--Wiener spaces.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CA\", \"categories\": \"math.CA,math.CV,math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T09:45:51Z\"}"}
