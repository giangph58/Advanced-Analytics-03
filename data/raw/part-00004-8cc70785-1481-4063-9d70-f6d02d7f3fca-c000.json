Aganagic\\nhas predicted that Khovanov homology can be recovered from the braid group\\naction on Fukaya-Seidel categories arising from monodromy in said space of\\npotentials. These categories have since been rigorously studied, and shown to\\ncontain a certain (combinatorially defined) category on which Webster had\\npreviously constructed a (combinatorially defined) braid group action from\\nwhich the Khovanov homology can be recovered.\\n  Here we show, by a direct calculation, that the aforementioned containment\\nintertwines said combinatorially defined braid group action with the braid\\ngroup action arising naturally from monodromy. This provides a mathematical\\nverification that Aganagic's proposal gives a symplectic construction of\\nKhovanov homology -- with both gradings, and over the integers.\", \"main_category\": \"math.SG\", \"categories\": \"math.SG,hep-th,math.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T05:55:28Z\"}"}
