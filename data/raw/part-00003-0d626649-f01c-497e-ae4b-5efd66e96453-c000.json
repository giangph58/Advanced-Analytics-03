However, these methods fail when all\\npathways to the goal are blocked. In such cases, the robot must reason about\\nhow to reconfigure the environment to access task-relevant regions - a problem\\nknown as Navigation Among Movable Objects (NAMO). While various solutions to\\nthis problem have been developed, they often struggle to scale to highly\\ncluttered environments. To address this, we propose NAMO-LLM, a sampling-based\\nplanner that searches over robot and obstacle configurations to compute\\nfeasible plans specifying which obstacles to move, where, and in what order.\\nIts key novelty is a non-uniform sampling strategy guided by Large Language\\nModels (LLMs) biasing the tree construction toward directions more likely to\\nyield a solution. We show that NAMO-LLM is probabilistically complete and\\ndemonstrate through experiments that it efficiently scales to cluttered\\nenvironments, outperforming related works in both runtime and plan quality.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T05:45:33Z\"}"}
