Focusing on the Cr2N as one of\\nthe 2D-MXenes, the bilayers of Cr2N/Co and Cr2N/Pt are prepared by magnetron\\nsputtering technique. XMCD reveals the induced magnetic moment of Cr in the\\nCr2N/Co interface, while it is not observed in the Cr2N/Pt interface at room\\ntemperature. To distinguish the possible origins of either the interlayer\\nmagnetic exchange coupling or the charge transfer at the interfaces, the\\nadditional controlled Cr2N/Cu bilayer, whose work function of Cu is consistent\\nwith Co, is prepared. HAXPES spectra for the Cr 2p core level near the\\ninterface of Cr2N/Cu is consistent with that of Cr2N/Co, indicating that the\\ninduced magnetic moment of Cr observed by XMCD for the Cr2N/Co can be\\nattributed to the interlayer magnetic exchange coupling, rather than the charge\\ntransfer, which is a specific characteristics emerged at the interface with\\n2D-MXene.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T07:27:39Z\"}"}
