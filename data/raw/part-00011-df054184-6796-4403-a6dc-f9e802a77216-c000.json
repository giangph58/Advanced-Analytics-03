{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16477v1\", \"title\": \"Distributed Optimization with Efficient Communication, Event-Triggered\\n  Solution Enhancement, and Operation Stopping\", \"summary\": \"In modern large-scale systems with sensor networks and IoT devices it is\\nessential to collaboratively solve complex problems while utilizing network\\nresources efficiently. In our paper we present three distributed optimization\\nalgorithms that exhibit efficient communication among nodes. Our first\\nalgorithm presents a simple quantized averaged gradient procedure for\\ndistributed optimization, which is shown to converge to a neighborhood of the\\noptimal solution. Our second algorithm incorporates a novel event-triggered\\nrefinement mechanism, which refines the utilized quantization level to enhance\\nthe precision of the estimated optimal solution. It enables nodes to terminate\\ntheir operation according to predefined performance guarantees. Our third\\nalgorithm is tailored to operate in environments where each message consists of\\nonly a few bits. It incorporates a novel event-triggered mechanism for\\nadjusting the quantizer basis and quantization level, allowing nodes to\\ncollaboratively decide operation termination based on predefined performance\\ncriteria. We analyze the three algorithms and establish their linear\\nconvergence. Finally, an application on distributed sensor fusion for target\\nlocalization is used to demonstrate their favorable performance compared to\\nexisting algorithms in the literature.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T07:42:02Z\"}"}
