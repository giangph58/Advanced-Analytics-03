However, the cost of creating training data for\\nthese tasks is considerably higher than for other tasks, making it difficult to\\nprepare large-scale datasets. Also, creating personalized ISP and IE with\\nminimal training data can lead to new value streams since preferred image\\nquality varies depending on the person and use case. While semi-supervised\\nlearning could be a potential solution in such cases, it has rarely been\\nutilized for these tasks. In this paper, we realize semi-supervised learning\\nfor ISP and IE leveraging a RAW image reconstruction (sRGB-to-RAW) method.\\nAlthough existing sRGB-to-RAW methods can generate pseudo-RAW image datasets\\nthat improve the accuracy of RAW-based high-level computer vision tasks such as\\nobject detection, their quality is not sufficient for ISP and IE tasks that\\nrequire precise image quality definition. Therefore, we also propose a\\nsRGB-to-RAW method that can improve the image quality of these tasks. The\\nproposed semi-supervised learning with the proposed sRGB-to-RAW method\\nsuccessfully improves the image quality of various models on various datasets.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T07:28:16Z\"}"}
