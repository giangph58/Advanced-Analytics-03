{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10378v1\", \"title\": \"Cosmogenic Neutrino Point Source and KM3-230213A\", \"summary\": \"Cosmogenic neutrinos (CNs) are produced by ultra-high energy cosmic rays\\n(UHECRs) interacting with cosmic background radiation. We investigated the\\nproperties of CN point/extended sources, i.e, the neutrino spectrum, and\\nangular profile as functions of time, by assuming that UHECR sources are\\ntransient events, such as gamma-ray bursts. The properties depend much on the\\nintergalactic magnetic field (IGMF), but the angular extent is in general\\nsub-degree, within which the CN flux can overshoot the diffuse CN flux in early\\ntime. The nearby CN point sources could be detected for the low IGMF case by\\nfuture neutrino telescopes. The recent KM3-230213A event is possible to account\\nfor by a nearby transient CN source, rather than diffuse CN emission.\\nObservations of CN point sources will provide a chance to search for UHECR\\nsources.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:24:52Z\"}"}
