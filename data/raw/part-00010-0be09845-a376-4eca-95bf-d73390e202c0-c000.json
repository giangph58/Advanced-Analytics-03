{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02611v1\", \"title\": \"Instance-Optimal Imprecise Convex Hull\", \"summary\": \"Imprecise measurements of a point set P = (p1, ..., pn) can be modelled by a\\nfamily of regions F = (R1, ..., Rn), where each imprecise region Ri contains a\\nunique point pi. A retrieval models an accurate measurement by replacing an\\nimprecise region Ri with its corresponding point pi. We construct the convex\\nhull of an imprecise point set in the plane, where regions in F may be\\nretrieved at unit cost. The goal is to determine the cyclic ordering of the\\nconvex hull vertices of P as efficiently as possible. Here, efficiency is\\ninterpreted in two ways: (i) minimising the number of retrievals, and (ii)\\ncomputing each retrieval location quickly.\\n  Prior works focused on only one of these two aspects: either minimising\\nretrievals or optimising algorithmic runtime. Our contribution is the first to\\nsimultaneously achieve both. Let r(F, P) denote the minimal number of\\nretrievals required by any algorithm to determine the convex hull of P for a\\ngiven instance (F, P). For a family F of n constant-complexity polygons, our\\nmain result is a reconstruction algorithm that performs O(r(F, P)) retrievals\\nin O(r(F, P) log^3 n) time.\\n  Compared to previous approaches that achieve optimal retrieval counts, we\\nimprove the runtime per retrieval by a exponential factor, from polynomial to\\npolylogarithmic. Compared to near-linear time algorithms, we significantly\\nreduce the number of retrievals used, and broaden the input families to include\\noverlapping regions. We further extend our results to simple k-gons and to\\npairwise disjoint disks with radii in [1,k], where our runtime scales linearly\\nwith k.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CG\", \"categories\": \"cs.CG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:12:36Z\"}"}
