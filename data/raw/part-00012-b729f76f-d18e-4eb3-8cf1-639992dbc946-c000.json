The data used for the\\nmeasurement consists of beauty meson decays produced in proton-proton\\ncollisions, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $9\\\\,$fb$^{-1}$,\\ncollected by the LHCb experiment between 2011 and 2018. The ratio of branching\\nfractions for $B^+\\\\to K^+\\\\mu^+\\\\mu^-$ and $B^+\\\\to K^+e^+e^-$ decays is measured\\nto be $R_K =\\n1.08^{+0.11}_{-0.09}\\\\;(\\\\text{stat})\\\\;^{+0.04}_{-0.04}\\\\;(\\\\text{syst})$, which is\\nconsistent with the Standard Model prediction of unity. This constitutes the\\nmost precise test of lepton flavour universality using $B^+\\\\to K^+\\\\ell^+\\\\ell^-$\\ndecays with dilepton invariant-mass-squared above the $\\\\psi(2S)$ mass, whilst\\nbeing the first of its kind at a hadron collider.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T12:39:51Z\"}"}
