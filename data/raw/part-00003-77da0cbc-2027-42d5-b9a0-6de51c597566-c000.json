Optical tweezers using OAM, often referred to as optical spanners,\\nhave significantly expanded the tunability of optical manipulation. A key\\nfrontier now lies in understanding how vortex beams interact with quantum\\nstates of matter. In this work, we numerically investigate the dynamics of a\\nsuperconductor under vortex beam illumination and demonstrate the transfer of\\nangular momentum from light to the superconducting collective mode, resulting\\nin mechanical rotation. Our findings open a pathway for optical manipulation in\\nthe quantum regime, which we term the quantum optical spanner.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T09:07:35Z\"}"}
