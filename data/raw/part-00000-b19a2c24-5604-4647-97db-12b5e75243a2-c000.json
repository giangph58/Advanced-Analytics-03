Many of these documents exist as images rather\\nthan as machine-readable text, which requires human annotation to train\\nautomated extraction systems. We present DocSpiral, the first\\nHuman-in-the-Spiral assistive document annotation platform, designed to address\\nthe challenge of extracting structured information from domain-specific,\\nimage-based document collections. Our spiral design establishes an iterative\\ncycle in which human annotations train models that progressively require less\\nmanual intervention. DocSpiral integrates document format normalization,\\ncomprehensive annotation interfaces, evaluation metrics dashboard, and API\\nendpoints for the development of AI / ML models into a unified workflow.\\nExperiments demonstrate that our framework reduces annotation time by at least\\n41\\\\% while showing consistent performance gains across three iterations during\\nmodel training. By making this annotation platform freely accessible, we aim to\\nlower barriers to AI/ML models development in document processing, facilitating\\nthe adoption of large language models in image-based, document-intensive fields\\nsuch as geoscience and healthcare. The system is freely available at:\\nhttps://app.ai4wa.com.
