{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16683v1\", \"title\": \"MCMC for Bayesian estimation of Differential Privacy from Membership\\n  Inference Attacks\", \"summary\": \"We propose a new framework for Bayesian estimation of differential privacy,\\nincorporating evidence from multiple membership inference attacks (MIA).\\nBayesian estimation is carried out via a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\\nalgorithm, named MCMC-DP-Est, which provides an estimate of the full posterior\\ndistribution of the privacy parameter (e.g., instead of just credible\\nintervals). Critically, the proposed method does not assume that privacy\\nauditing is performed with the most powerful attack on the worst-case (dataset,\\nchallenge point) pair, which is typically unrealistic. Instead, MCMC-DP-Est\\njointly estimates the strengths of MIAs used and the privacy of the training\\nalgorithm, yielding a more cautious privacy analysis. We also present an\\neconomical way to generate measurements for the performance of an MIA that is\\nto be used by the MCMC method to estimate privacy. We present the use of the\\nmethods with numerical examples with both artificial and real data.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T13:10:37Z\"}"}
