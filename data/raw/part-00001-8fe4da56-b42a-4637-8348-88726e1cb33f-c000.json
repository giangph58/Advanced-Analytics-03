We identify a sufficient condition for its convergence,\\nnamely the decay of the effective interaction. We prove that this condition is\\nsatisfied for systems in 1D at any temperature as well as in the\\nhigh-temperature regime under a certain commutativity condition on the\\nHamiltonian. This yields polynomial and quasi-polynomial time approximation\\nalgorithms in these settings, respectively. Furthermore, the decay of the\\neffective interaction implies the decay of the conditional mutual information\\nfor the Gibbs state of the system. We then use this fact to devise a rounding\\nscheme that maps the solution of the convex relaxation to a global state and\\nshow that the scheme can be efficiently implemented on a quantum computer, thus\\nproving efficiency of quantum Gibbs sampling under our assumption of decay of\\nthe effective interaction.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.stat-mech,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T09:53:53Z\"}"}
