{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04367v1\", \"title\": \"Deep Learning Innovations for Energy Efficiency: Advances in\\n  Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring and EV Charging Optimization for a Sustainable\\n  Grid\", \"summary\": \"The global energy landscape is undergoing a profound transformation, often\\nreferred to as the energy transition, driven by the urgent need to mitigate\\nclimate change, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and ensure sustainable energy\\nsupplies. However, the undoubted complexity of new investments in renewables,\\nas well as the phase out of high CO2-emission energy sources, hampers the pace\\nof the energy transition and raises doubts as to whether new renewable energy\\nsources are capable of solely meeting the climate target goals. This highlights\\nthe need to investigate alternative pathways to accelerate the energy\\ntransition, by identifying human activity domains with higher/excessive energy\\ndemands. Two notable examples where there is room for improvement, in the sense\\nof reducing energy consumption and consequently CO2 emissions, are residential\\nenergy consumption and road transport. This dissertation investigates the\\ndevelopment of novel Deep Learning techniques to create tools which solve\\nlimitations in these two key energy domains. Reduction of residential energy\\nconsumption can be achieved by empowering end-users with the user of\\nNon-Intrusive Load Monitoring, whereas optimization of EV charging with Deep\\nReinforcement Learning can tackle road transport decarbonization.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T12:36:19Z\"}"}
