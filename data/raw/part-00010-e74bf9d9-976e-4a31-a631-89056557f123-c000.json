For our purposes, we develop\\nan $L^{p}$-regularity framework for the solutions to the stochastic partial\\ndifferential equations associated with pseudo-differential operators. As the\\nmain tools, we establish the $p$-th moment maximal inequality for stochastic\\nintegrals with respect to a Hilbert space-valued Gaussian process and a\\nLittlewood-Paley type inequality for Banach space-valued functions.\\nAdditionally, during our study, we improved the sufficient conditions for\\nFourier multipliers and examined the covariance kernels for Gaussian processes.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T08:49:10Z\"}"}
