However the extent to which data favours such a primordial\\nspectra is not clear. In this work, we investigate power suppression and\\nrelated mitigation of lensing anomaly with the help of phenomenological models\\nwhich are valid over scales of interest. We consider simple extensions to\\nnearly scale invariant power spectra such as those which includes running and\\nrunning of running of spectral index. We perform Bayesian analysis of these\\nmodels, which are agnostic about power suppression, with various data sets and\\nshow that data tend to choose parameters which leads to power suppression at\\nlow multipoles. We then analyse the significance of these findings using\\ninformation criteria. Further, we investigate the ability of near-ultimate\\nfuture CMB missions such as ECHO to put tighter constraints on these models. We\\nconclude that we can make stronger conclusions about the presence of power\\nsuppression in the future by studying such simple phenomenological models.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T07:37:11Z\"}"}
