The trans-series is\\nwritten explicitly in terms of a perturbative basis, which can be obtained from\\nthe already known perturbative expansion of the density by solving several\\nordinary differential equations. Unknown integration constants are fixed from\\nVolin's method. We have checked that our solution satisfies the analytical\\nconsistency requirements including the newly derived resurgence relations and\\nagrees with the high precision numerical solution. Our results also provides\\nthe full analytic trans-series for the capacitance of the coaxial circular\\nplate capacitor.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,cond-mat.quant-gas,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T11:46:11Z\"}"}
