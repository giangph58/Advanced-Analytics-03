{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05809v1\", \"title\": \"Loss-free enhancement of photonic spin Hall shift by electromagnetically\\n  induced transparency\", \"summary\": \"The photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE), a result of spin-orbit interaction, has\\nattracted significant interest because of its fundamental importance and\\npotential applications. Optical losses are ubiquitous, which inherently\\nsuppress the photonic spin Hall shift (PSHS). In this work, we consider an\\natomic medium that exhibits both absorption and transparency to investigate and\\nmitigate the effects of loss on PSHS. We demonstrate that laser-induced\\ncoherence in an atomic medium, leading to electromagnetically induced\\ntransparency (EIT) at resonance, counteracts the detrimental effects of losses\\non the PSHS. Upon EIT in a coherent medium enclosed within dielectric slabs,\\nthe reflectivity of the incident polarized state is reduced near Brewster's\\nangle to enhance PSHS. Moreover, the tunable refractive index of the atomic\\nmedium enables the manipulation of PSHS without structural modifications with a\\ntiny loss. Our proposed loss-free approach to PSHS may enable advanced optical\\nsensing and other spin-based applications.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T08:41:27Z\"}"}
