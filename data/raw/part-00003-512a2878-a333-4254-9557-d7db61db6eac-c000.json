Generative AI and Gender Bias\", \"summary\": \"Generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models\\n(LLMs), is being rapidly deployed in recruitment and for candidate\\nshortlisting. We audit several mid-sized open-source LLMs for gender bias using\\na dataset of 332,044 real-world online job postings. For each posting, we\\nprompt the model to recommend whether an equally qualified male or female\\ncandidate should receive an interview callback. We find that most models tend\\nto favor men, especially for higher-wage roles. Mapping job descriptions to the\\nStandard Occupational Classification system, we find lower callback rates for\\nwomen in male-dominated occupations and higher rates in female-associated ones,\\nindicating occupational segregation. A comprehensive analysis of linguistic\\nfeatures in job ads reveals strong alignment of model recommendations with\\ntraditional gender stereotypes. To examine the role of recruiter identity, we\\nsteer model behavior by infusing Big Five personality traits and simulating the\\nperspectives of historical figures. We find that less agreeable personas reduce\\nstereotyping, consistent with an agreeableness bias in LLMs. Our findings\\nhighlight how AI-driven hiring may perpetuate biases in the labor market and\\nhave implications for fairness and diversity within firms.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,cs.CL,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T07:55:52Z\"}"}
