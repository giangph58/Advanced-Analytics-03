In the last\\nyears, it has been improved by several techniques to perform better than its\\noriginal version, handling a challenging dataset like CIFAR10 without losing\\nits flexibility and low memory usage. We have shown in our results that\\nimprovements are achieved through a combination of convolutional channel\\ngrouping, learning rate schedules, and independent block structures during\\ntraining that lead to a 20\\\\% decrease in test error percentage. Additionally,\\nto approach further implementations on low-capacity hardware projects we have\\npresented a series of lighter models that achieve low test error percentages\\nwithin (21$\\\\pm$6)\\\\% and number of trainable parameters between 164,706 and\\n754,386. This serving also as a basis for our future study on complete\\nverification and validation of these kinds of neural networks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:03:52Z\"}"}
