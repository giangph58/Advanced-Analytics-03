{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04224v1\", \"title\": \"The emergence of the relativistic Lagrangian from the non-relativistic\\n  multiplicative Lagrangian\", \"summary\": \"The multiplicative Lagrangian and Hamiltonian introduce an additional\\nparameter that, despite its variation, results in identical equations of motion\\nas those derived from the standard Lagrangian. This intriguing property becomes\\neven more striking in the case of a free particle. By manipulating the\\nparameter and integrating out, the statistical average of the multiplicative\\nLagrangian and Hamiltonian naturally arises. Astonishingly, from this\\nstatistical viewpoint, the relativistic Lagrangian and Hamiltonian emerge with\\nremarkable elegance. On the action level, this formalism unveils a deeper\\nconnection: the spacetime of Einstein's theory reveals itself from a\\nstatistical perspective through the action associated with the multiplicative\\nLagrangian. This suggests that the multiplicative Lagrangian/Hamiltonian\\nframework offers a profound and beautiful foundation, one that reveals the\\nunderlying unity between classical and relativistic descriptions in a way that\\ntranscends traditional formulations. In essence, the multiplicative approach\\nintroduces a richer and more intricate structure to our understanding of\\nphysics, bridging the gap between different theoretical realms through a\\nstatistical perspective.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,physics.class-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:21:10Z\"}"}
