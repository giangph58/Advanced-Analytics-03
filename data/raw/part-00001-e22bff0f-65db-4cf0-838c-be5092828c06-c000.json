{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17680v1\", \"title\": \"Time-reversed Stochastic Inflation\", \"summary\": \"Cosmic inflation may exhibit stochastic periods during which quantum\\nfluctuations dominate over the semi-classical evolution. Extracting observables\\nin these regimes is a notoriously difficult program as quantum randomness makes\\nthem fully probabilistic. However, among all the possible quantum histories,\\nthe ones which are relevant for Cosmology are conditioned by the requirement\\nthat stochastic inflation ended. From an observational point of view, it would\\nbe more convenient to model stochastic periods as starting from the time at\\nwhich they ended and evolving backwards in times. We present a time-reversed\\napproach to stochastic inflation, based on a reverse Fokker-Planck equation,\\nwhich allows us to derive non-perturbatively the probability distribution of\\nthe field values at a given time before the end of the quantum regime. As a\\nmotivated example, we solve the flat semi-infinite potential and derive a new\\nand exact formula for the probability distribution of the quantum-generated\\ncurvature fluctuations. It is normalisable while exhibiting tails slowly\\ndecaying as a Levy distribution. Our reverse-time stochastic formalism could be\\napplied to any inflationary potentials and quantum diffusion eras, including\\nthe ones that can lead to the formation of primordial black holes.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:53:17Z\"}"}
