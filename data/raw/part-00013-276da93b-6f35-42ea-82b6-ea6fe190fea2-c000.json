{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07819v1\", \"title\": \"Testing Leptogenesis from Observable Gravitational Waves\", \"summary\": \"Leptogenesis provides an elegant mechanism to explain the observed baryon\\nasymmetry of the Universe (BAU), yet its experimental verification remains\\nchallenging due to requirements of either extremely heavy right-handed\\nneutrinos or precisely fine-tuned mass splittings. We adapt a solution by\\nintroducing an extra scalar field that significantly enhances $CP$ asymmetry\\nthrough loop-level contributions. This scalar extension not only facilitates\\nsuccessful leptogenesis but also enables a strong first-order electroweak phase\\ntransition, generating potentially observable gravitational waves (GWs). We\\ndemonstrate a strong correlation between the generated BAU and the GW signal\\nstrength, establishing a unique way to test the leptogenesis. We show that when\\nthe model achieves a successful BAU, the resulting GW signal from EWPT can have\\nsignal-to-noise ratio of $\\\\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ and $\\\\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ at the\\nupcoming LISA and DECIGO experiments, respectively. This work presents a\\nconcrete connection between successful leptogenesis and detectable GWs,\\noffering a promising method for experimental testing of the leptogenesis\\nmechanism through future GW observations.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:57:22Z\"}"}
