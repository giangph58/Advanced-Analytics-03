To\\naddress these challenges, we propose a doped HfO2-based, silicon-compatible\\nasymmetric resonant ferroelectric tunnel junction design with a quantum well\\nembedded between two ferroelectric layers, replacing the conventional\\nmetal-ferroelectric-metal structure. Using a self-consistent coupling of the\\nnon-equilibrium Green's function method with a Preisach-based model, we\\ndemonstrate that the quantum well enhances resonant tunneling effects, leading\\nto a simultaneous reduction in the resistance-area product and a boost in the\\ntunnel electroresistance ratio. The low-resistance state becomes more robust,\\nwhile the high-resistance state is suppressed, improving readout speed and\\nreducing power usage. We observed that incorporating a 2 nm quantum well\\nsignificantly enhances the tunnel electroresistance ratio, achieving a peak\\nvalue of approximately 6.15 x 10^4 percent, while simultaneously minimizing the\\nresistance-area product to 47.1 Ohm-cm^2 at 0.175 V. Additionally, the device\\nexhibits negative differential resistance, further enhancing its functionality.\\nOur results confirm that this design enables scalable, energy-efficient, and\\nhigh-performance non-volatile memory, making it a strong candidate for future\\nmemory technologies.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T12:39:54Z\"}"}
