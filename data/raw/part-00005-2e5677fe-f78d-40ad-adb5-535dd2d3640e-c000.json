Certain pion terms lead\\nto significant improvements in the description of ground-state energies,\\nindicating they might be useful ingredients for true ab initio energy density\\nfunctionals. In addition, we present estimates of the statistical parameter\\nuncertainties of the GUDE functionals.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T12:20:22Z\"}"}
