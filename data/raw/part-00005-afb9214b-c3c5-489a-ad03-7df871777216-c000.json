Our study is based on an analytical evaluation of\\nthe infinite Bessel summations involved, which previously had led to a\\nnumerical exploration of the so-called attractor diagram. The analytical\\nexpressions are then suitable for further asymptotic analysis in opposing\\nregimes of the amplitude, which allows for a characterisation of the diagram in\\nterms of elementary functions. The same method is applied to the study of\\noptomechanical limit cycles, extending previous results for enhanced values of\\nthe parameter space without the need for approximations such as the resolved\\nsideband approximation.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.mes-hall,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:41:35Z\"}"}
