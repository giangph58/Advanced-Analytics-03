{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05360v1\", \"title\": \"DSDrive: Distilling Large Language Model for Lightweight End-to-End\\n  Autonomous Driving with Unified Reasoning and Planning\", \"summary\": \"We present DSDrive, a streamlined end-to-end paradigm tailored for\\nintegrating the reasoning and planning of autonomous vehicles into a unified\\nframework. DSDrive leverages a compact LLM that employs a distillation method\\nto preserve the enhanced reasoning capabilities of a larger-sized vision\\nlanguage model (VLM). To effectively align the reasoning and planning tasks, a\\nwaypoint-driven dual-head coordination module is further developed, which\\nsynchronizes dataset structures, optimization objectives, and the learning\\nprocess. By integrating these tasks into a unified framework, DSDrive anchors\\non the planning results while incorporating detailed reasoning insights,\\nthereby enhancing the interpretability and reliability of the end-to-end\\npipeline. DSDrive has been thoroughly tested in closed-loop simulations, where\\nit performs on par with benchmark models and even outperforms in many key\\nmetrics, all while being more compact in size. Additionally, the computational\\nefficiency of DSDrive (as reflected in its time and memory requirements during\\ninference) has been significantly enhanced. Evidently thus, this work brings\\npromising aspects and underscores the potential of lightweight systems in\\ndelivering interpretable and efficient solutions for AD.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:53:34Z\"}"}
