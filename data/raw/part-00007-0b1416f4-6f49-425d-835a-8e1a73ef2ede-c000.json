{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03576v1\", \"title\": \"Design and Development of a Robust Tolerance Optimisation Framework for\\n  Automated Optical Inspection in Semiconductor Manufacturing\", \"summary\": \"Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) is widely used across various industries,\\nincluding surface mount technology in semiconductor manufacturing. One of the\\nkey challenges in AOI is optimising inspection tolerances. Traditionally, this\\nprocess relies heavily on the expertise and intuition of engineers, making it\\nsubjective and prone to inconsistency. To address this, we are developing an\\nintelligent, data-driven approach to optimise inspection tolerances in a more\\nobjective and consistent manner. Most existing research in this area focuses\\nprimarily on minimising false calls, often at the risk of allowing actual\\ndefects to go undetected. This oversight can compromise product quality,\\nespecially in critical sectors such as medical, defence, and automotive\\nindustries. Our approach introduces the use of percentile rank, amongst other\\nlogical strategies, to ensure that genuine defects are not overlooked. With\\ncontinued refinement, our method aims to reach a point where every flagged item\\nis a true defect, thereby eliminating the need for manual inspection. Our proof\\nof concept achieved an 18% reduction in false calls at the 80th percentile\\nrank, while maintaining a 100% recall rate. This makes the system both\\nefficient and reliable, offering significant time and cost savings.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T14:35:58Z\"}"}
