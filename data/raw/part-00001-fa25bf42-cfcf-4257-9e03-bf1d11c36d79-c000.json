{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03361v1\", \"title\": \"Interpretable Zero-shot Learning with Infinite Class Concepts\", \"summary\": \"Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize unseen classes by aligning images\\nwith intermediate class semantics, like human-annotated concepts or class\\ndefinitions. An emerging alternative leverages Large-scale Language Models\\n(LLMs) to automatically generate class documents. However, these methods often\\nface challenges with transparency in the classification process and may suffer\\nfrom the notorious hallucination problem in LLMs, resulting in non-visual class\\nsemantics. This paper redefines class semantics in ZSL with a focus on\\ntransferability and discriminability, introducing a novel framework called\\nZero-shot Learning with Infinite Class Concepts (InfZSL). Our approach\\nleverages the powerful capabilities of LLMs to dynamically generate an\\nunlimited array of phrase-level class concepts. To address the hallucination\\nchallenge, we introduce an entropy-based scoring process that incorporates a\\n``goodness\\\" concept selection mechanism, ensuring that only the most\\ntransferable and discriminative concepts are selected. Our InfZSL framework not\\nonly demonstrates significant improvements on three popular benchmark datasets\\nbut also generates highly interpretable, image-grounded concepts. Code will be\\nreleased upon acceptance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T09:30:30Z\"}"}
