The\\nprior experimental work utilized up to three geographically-spaced synchronized\\nradio telescopes, a single-dish radio telescope, and a radio interferometer.\\nThe experimental work reported here examines full right ascension coverage at\\none declination, utilizing the interferometer, during 124.1 days. Results\\nsuggest the possible presence of an additional anomalous celestial pointing\\ndirection. Seven standard deviations of noise-modeled shifts of mean polarized\\npulse pair count were observed in three celestial directions. Indications of\\ninterferometer space delay aliasing were observed. A phase noise test,\\ncelestial source identification methods and associated measurements were used\\nto seek potential explanations of the unusual observed phenomena.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP,astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T13:03:59Z\"}"}
