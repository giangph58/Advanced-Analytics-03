{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00704v1\", \"title\": \"Controllable Weather Synthesis and Removal with Video Diffusion Models\", \"summary\": \"Generating realistic and controllable weather effects in videos is valuable\\nfor many applications. Physics-based weather simulation requires precise\\nreconstructions that are hard to scale to in-the-wild videos, while current\\nvideo editing often lacks realism and control. In this work, we introduce\\nWeatherWeaver, a video diffusion model that synthesizes diverse weather effects\\n-- including rain, snow, fog, and clouds -- directly into any input video\\nwithout the need for 3D modeling. Our model provides precise control over\\nweather effect intensity and supports blending various weather types, ensuring\\nboth realism and adaptability. To overcome the scarcity of paired training\\ndata, we propose a novel data strategy combining synthetic videos, generative\\nimage editing, and auto-labeled real-world videos. Extensive evaluations show\\nthat our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in weather simulation and\\nremoval, providing high-quality, physically plausible, and\\nscene-identity-preserving results over various real-world videos.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GR\", \"categories\": \"cs.GR,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T17:59:57Z\"}"}
