We use new light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet\\nSurvey Satellite (TESS) and published radial velocities to determine the\\nphysical properties of the component stars. We find masses of 2.098 +/- 0.021\\nMsun and 2.091 +/- 0.018 Msun, and radii of 2.179 +/- 0.008 Rsun and 2.139 +/-\\n0.007 Rsun. The measured distance to the system is affected by the light from a\\nnearby companion star; we obtain 178.4 +/- 2.5 pc. The properties of the system\\nare best matched by theoretical predictions for a subsolar metallicity of Z =\\n0.010 and an age of 570 Myr. We measure seven significant pulsation frequencies\\nfrom the light curve, six of which are consistent with delta Scuti pulsations\\nand one of which is likely of slowly-pulsating B-star type.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:37:29Z\"}"}
