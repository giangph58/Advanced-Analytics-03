This paper shows that there always exists a\\ncontroller with integer coefficients stabilizing a given discrete-time linear\\ntime-invariant plant. A constructive algorithm to obtain such a controller is\\nprovided, along with numerical examples. Furthermore, the proposed method is\\napplied to converting a pre-designed controller to have integer coefficients,\\nwhile the original performance is preserved in the sense that the transfer\\nfunction of the closed-loop system remains unchanged.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T12:21:00Z\"}"}
