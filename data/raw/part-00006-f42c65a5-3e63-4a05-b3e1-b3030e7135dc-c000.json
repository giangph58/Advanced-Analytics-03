{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03428v1\", \"title\": \"Airdrop Games\", \"summary\": \"Launching a new blockchain system or application is frequently facilitated by\\na so called airdrop, where the system designer chooses a pre-existing set of\\npotentially interested parties and allocates newly minted tokens to them with\\nthe expectation that they will participate in the system - such engagement,\\nespecially if it is of significant level, facilitates the system and raises its\\nvalue and also the value of its newly minted token, hence benefiting the\\nairdrop recipients. A number of challenging questions befuddle designers in\\nthis setting, such as how to choose the set of interested parties and how to\\nallocate tokens to them. To address these considerations we put forward a\\ngame-theoretic model for such airdrop games. Our model can be used to guide the\\ndesigner's choices based on the way the system's value depends on participation\\n(modeled by a ''technology function'' in our framework) and the costs that\\nparticipants incur. We identify both bad and good equilibria and identify the\\nsettings and the choices that can be made where the designer can influence the\\nplayers towards good equilibria in an expedient manner.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GT\", \"categories\": \"cs.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T11:10:16Z\"}"}
