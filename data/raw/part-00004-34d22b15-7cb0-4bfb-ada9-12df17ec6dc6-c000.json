{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15715v1\", \"title\": \"Assessing FAIRness of the Digital Shadow Reference Model\", \"summary\": \"Models play a critical role in managing the vast amounts of data and\\nincreasing complexity found in the IoT, IIoT, and IoP domains. The Digital\\nShadow Reference Model, which serves as a foundational metadata schema for\\nlinking data and metadata in these environments, is an example of such a model.\\nEnsuring FAIRness (adherence to the FAIR Principles) is critical because it\\nimproves data findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability,\\nfacilitating efficient data management and integration across systems.\\n  This paper presents an evaluation of the FAIRness of the Digital Shadow\\nReference Model using a structured evaluation framework based on the FAIR Data\\nPrinciples. Using the concept of FAIR Implementation Profiles (FIPs),\\nsupplemented by a mini-questionnaire, we systematically evaluate the model's\\nadherence to these principles. Our analysis identifies key strengths, including\\nthe model's metadata schema that supports rich descriptions and authentication\\ntechniques, and highlights areas for improvement, such as the need for globally\\nunique identifiers and consequent support for different Web standards. The\\nresults provide actionable insights for improving the FAIRness of the model and\\npromoting better data management and reuse. This research contributes to the\\nfield by providing a detailed assessment of the Digital Shadow Reference Model\\nand recommending next steps to improve its FAIRness and usability.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DB\", \"categories\": \"cs.DB,cs.CY,cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T08:58:48Z\"}"}
