{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21481v1\", \"title\": \"Evidence for Dynamical Dark Matter\", \"summary\": \"The nature of dark matter is one of the most fundamental questions in\\ncosmology. Using the cosmic microwave background (CMB), type Ia supernova (SN)\\nand DESI's new measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), we find the\\nrobust $\\\\sim2\\\\,\\\\sigma$ evidences of the evolution of dark matter in the\\ndynamical dark matter (DDM) model,\\n$\\\\omega_{dm}(a)=\\\\omega_{dm0}+\\\\omega_{dma}(1-a)$. Based on CMB data, we find a\\nvery strong linear relation $\\\\omega_{dma}=-\\\\omega_{dm0}$, inducing the\\nsingle-parameter DDM model, $\\\\omega_{dm}(a)=\\\\omega_{dm}a$, where the\\n$\\\\sim2\\\\,\\\\sigma$ DDM evidences is well captured and even strengthened. We\\ndemonstrate that there are beyond $2\\\\,\\\\sigma$ evidences of the coexistence of\\nDDM and dynamical dark energy using the combinations of CMB, DESI BAO and\\nPantheon+ SN data. In such models, at a beyond $5\\\\,\\\\sigma$ confidence level, we\\nverify that the universe remains in a matter-dominated state for a substantial\\nperiod in the past, accelerate in the distant future and finally becomes\\ncompletely dominated by dark matter. We propose that the ultimate fate of the\\nuniverse is the ``Super Rip'' induced by dark matter with an extremely negative\\npressure. Our findings fundamentally challenge the prevailing understanding of\\ncosmic acceleration and deepen our insight into the universe's evolution.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T10:05:45Z\"}"}
