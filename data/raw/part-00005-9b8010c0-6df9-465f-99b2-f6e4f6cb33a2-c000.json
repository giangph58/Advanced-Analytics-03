Remarkably, this\\ngeneralized bound supplements the standard commutator term and the covariance\\nterm with an additional positive contribution that depends on the commutator of\\nobservables. The relation also rigorously proves and extends a conjectured\\nuncertainty relation previously proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 062215 (2024)].\\nFor two-level quantum systems, the inequality becomes an exact equality for any\\nstate and any pair of observables, establishing that the bound is tight in the\\nstrongest possible sense.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.stat-mech,hep-th,math-ph,math.MP,physics.ed-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T04:00:02Z\"}"}
