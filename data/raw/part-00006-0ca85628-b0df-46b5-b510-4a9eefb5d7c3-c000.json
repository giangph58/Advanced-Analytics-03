The most onerous obstacle to the stable\\noperation of this ring is a phenomenon of stochastic charge state\\nconversions(SCSC) of the ions in the beam caused by the collision with the\\ntarget. This phenomenon causes a rapid increase in the beam emittance. To solve\\nthis problem, we have developed a method to match the closed orbits and beta\\nfunctions of the beams in different charge states at the production target\\nlocation in the scaling FFA ring. In this paper, we show through 6D beam\\ntracking simulations that the FFA ring with modulated $k$ suppresses the\\nemittance growth even in the presence of SCSC, and it can accumulate the beam\\nover 600 turns effectively.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.acc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.acc-ph,nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T07:27:27Z\"}"}
