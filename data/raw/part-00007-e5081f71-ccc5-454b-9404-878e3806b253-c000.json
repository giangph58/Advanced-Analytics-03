In this study, we conduct a comprehensive investigation on the\\nintricate phase transitions and their multiferroic couplings in CCPS across a\\nwide temperature range from 4 to 345 K through Raman spectroscopic measurements\\ndown to 5 cm$^{-1}$. We first assign the observed Raman modes with the support\\nof theoretical calculations and angle-resolved polarized Raman measurements. We\\nfurther present clear signatures of phase transitions from analyses of\\ntemperature-dependent Raman spectral parameters. Particularly, two\\nlow-frequency soft modes are observed at 36.1 cm$^{-1}$ and 70.5 cm$^{-1}$\\nbelow 145 K, indicating the antiferroelectric to quasi-antiferroelectric\\ntransition. Moreover, phonon modes hardening is observed when the temperature\\nincreases from 4 to 65 K, suggesting negative thermal expansion (NTE) and\\nstrong magnetoelastic coupling below 65 K. These findings advance the\\nunderstanding of vdW multiferroic CCPS, paving the way for future design and\\nengineering of multiferroicity in cutting-edge technologies, such as\\nspintronics and quantum devices.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T06:22:47Z\"}"}
