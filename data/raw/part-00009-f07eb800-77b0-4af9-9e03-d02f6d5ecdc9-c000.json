Recent\\nstudies propose utilizing photon-induced processes as a direct probe,\\nleveraging the complete linear polarization of emitted photons whose\\norientation strongly correlates with the collision geometry. In this work, we\\nemploy a QED-based approach to systematically investigate dilepton production\\nvia two-photon processes in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC energies and\\ndetector acceptances. Our calculations reveal that dilepton emission exhibits\\nsignificant sensitivity to the initial collision geometry through both the\\nazimuthal angles of their emission (defined by the relative momentum vector of\\nthe two leptons) and the overall momentum orientation of the dilepton pairs.\\nThese findings highlight the potential of two-photon-generated dileptons as a\\nnovel, polarization-driven probe to quantify the initial collision geometry and\\nreduce uncertainties in characterizing quark-gluon plasma properties.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T11:10:15Z\"}"}
