Using this diagram, we enumerate and\\nplot all the global phase-space diagrams that occur as the circulations of the\\nthree vortices are varied. The reduction proceeds in two steps: a reduction to\\nJacobi coordinates and a Lie-Poisson reduction. In a recent paper, we used a\\ndifferent method in the second step. This took two forms depending on a sign\\nthat arose in the calculation. The Lie-Poisson equations unify these into a\\nsingle form. The Jacobi coordinate reduction fails when the total circulation\\nvanishes. We adapt the reduction method to this case and show how it relates to\\nthe non-vanishing case.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T17:03:03Z\"}"}
