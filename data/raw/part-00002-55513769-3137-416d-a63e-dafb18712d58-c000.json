{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15565v1\", \"title\": \"DecETT: Accurate App Fingerprinting Under Encrypted Tunnels via Dual\\n  Decouple-based Semantic Enhancement\", \"summary\": \"Due to the growing demand for privacy protection, encrypted tunnels have\\nbecome increasingly popular among mobile app users, which brings new challenges\\nto app fingerprinting (AF)-based network management. Existing methods primarily\\ntransfer traditional AF methods to encrypted tunnels directly, ignoring the\\ncore obfuscation and re-encapsulation mechanism of encrypted tunnels, thus\\nresulting in unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose DecETT, a\\ndual decouple-based semantic enhancement method for accurate AF under encrypted\\ntunnels. Specifically, DecETT improves AF under encrypted tunnels from two\\nperspectives: app-specific feature enhancement and irrelevant tunnel feature\\ndecoupling.Considering the obfuscated app-specific information in encrypted\\ntunnel traffic, DecETT introduces TLS traffic with stronger app-specific\\ninformation as a semantic anchor to guide and enhance the fingerprint\\ngeneration for tunnel traffic. Furthermore, to address the app-irrelevant\\ntunnel feature introduced by the re-encapsulation mechanism, DecETT is designed\\nwith a dual decouple-based fingerprint enhancement module, which decouples the\\ntunnel feature and app semantic feature from tunnel traffic separately, thereby\\nminimizing the impact of tunnel features on accurate app fingerprint\\nextraction. Evaluation under five prevalent encrypted tunnels indicates that\\nDecETT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accurate AF under encrypted\\ntunnels, and further demonstrates its superiority under tunnels with more\\ncomplicated obfuscation. \\\\textit{Project page:\\n\\\\href{https://github.com/DecETT/DecETT}{https://github.com/DecETT/DecETT}}\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T03:34:22Z\"}"}
