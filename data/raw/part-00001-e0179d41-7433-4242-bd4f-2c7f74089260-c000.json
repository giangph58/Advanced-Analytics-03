For the average games with finite\\nstates and actions, we first introduce the so-called irreducibility coefficient\\nand then establish its equivalence to the irreducibility condition. Using this\\nequivalence,we develop an iteration algorithm to compute\\n$\\\\varepsilon$-approximations of the value (for any given $\\\\varepsilon>0$) and\\nshow its convergence. Based on $\\\\varepsilon$-approximations of the value and\\nthe irreducibility coefficient, we further propose another iteration algorithm,\\nwhich is proved to obtain $\\\\varepsilon$-saddle points in finite steps. Finally,\\na numerical example of energy management in smart grids is provided to\\nillustrate our results.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T16:27:18Z\"}"}
