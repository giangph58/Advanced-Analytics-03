Here we introduce a method\\nof \\\\textit{topological steering} to determine the optimal pathway by which a\\nfilament may knot or unknot while subject to a given set of physics. The method\\ninvolves measuring the knotoid spectrum of a space curve projected onto many\\nsurfaces and computing the mean unravelling number of those projections.\\nSeveral perturbations of a curve can be generated stochastically, e.g. using\\nthe Langevin equation or crankshaft moves, and a gradient can be followed that\\nmaximises or minimises the topological complexity. We apply this method to a\\npolymer model based on a growing self-avoiding tangent-sphere chain, which can\\nbe made to model proteins by imposing a constraint that the bending and\\ntwisting angles between successive spheres must maintain the distribution found\\nin naturally occurring protein structures. We show that without these\\nprotein-like geometric constraints, topologically optimised polymers typically\\nform alternating torus knots and composites thereof, similar to the stochastic\\nknots predicted for long DNA. However, when the geometric constraints are\\nimposed on the system, the frequency of twist knots increases, similar to the\\nobserved abundance of twist knots in protein structures.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GT\", \"categories\": \"math.GT,cond-mat.soft,cond-mat.stat-mech,q-bio.BM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T05:39:30Z\"}"}
