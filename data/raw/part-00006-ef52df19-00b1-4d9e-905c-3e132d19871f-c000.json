{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20044v1\", \"title\": \"How Charged Can Neutrinos Be?\", \"summary\": \"We investigate how neutrinos may acquire small electric charges within the\\nStandard Model framework while preserving electromagnetic gauge invariance.\\nInstead of gauging the standard hypercharge generator $Y$, a linear combination\\nof $Y$ and a new generator $X$ from a gaugable global $U(1)_X$ symmetry is\\nembedded, under which neutrinos transform non-trivially. We demonstrate that\\nminimal scenarios based on flavor-dependent $U(1)_X$ symmetries, such as $X =\\nL_\\\\alpha - L_\\\\beta$, are incompatible with current neutrino oscillation data.\\nIn contrast, we have shown that only flavor-universal $U(1)_X$ symmetries-such\\nas $U(1)_{B-L}$, which shifts both quark and lepton charges, and $U(1)_L$,\\nwhich modifies only the lepton sector-can generate tiny neutrino charges\\nconsistent with observed masses and mixing. We also discuss the necessary\\nconnection between such charges and the Dirac nature of neutrinos. By analyzing\\nthe phenomenological implications in detail, our findings emphasize that\\nconstraints on neutrino charges should be evaluated within the specific\\nframework of the $U(1)_X$ symmetry under consideration, rather than assuming a\\ngeneric approach, as is often the case.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,astro-ph.HE,hep-ex,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:59:59Z\"}"}
