The key challenge of accurate prediction is how to model the complex\\nspatio-temporal dependencies and adapt to the inherent dynamics in data.\\nTraditional Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) often struggle with static\\nadjacency matrices that introduce domain bias or learnable matrices that may be\\noverfitting to specific patterns. This challenge becomes more complex when\\nconsidering Multi-Task Learning (MTL). While MTL has the potential to enhance\\nprediction accuracy through task synergies, it can also face significant\\nhurdles due to task interference. To overcome these challenges, this study\\nintroduces a novel MTL framework, Dynamic Group-wise Spatio-Temporal Multi-Task\\nLearning (DG-STMTL). DG-STMTL proposes a hybrid adjacency matrix generation\\nmodule that combines static matrices with dynamic ones through a task-specific\\ngating mechanism. We also introduce a group-wise GCN module to enhance the\\nmodelling capability of spatio-temporal dependencies. We conduct extensive\\nexperiments on two real-world datasets to evaluate our method. Results show\\nthat our method outperforms other state-of-the-arts, indicating its\\neffectiveness and robustness.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:00:20Z\"}"}
