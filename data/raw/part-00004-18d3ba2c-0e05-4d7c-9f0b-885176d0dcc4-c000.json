The bound extends\\navailable achievability results for the per-user error probability in the\\nunsourced multiple access framework, where, different from our setup, message\\ncollisions are treated as errors. Specifically, we provide an upper bound on\\nthe total variation distance between the type (i.e., the empirical probability\\nmass function) of the transmitted messages and its estimate over a Gaussian\\nmultiple access channel. Through numerical simulations, we illustrate that our\\nbound can be used to determine the message type that is less efficient to\\ntransmit, because more difficult to detect. We finally show that a practical\\nscheme for type estimation, based on coded compressed sensing with approximate\\nmessage passing, operates approximately 3 dB away from the bound, for the\\nparameters considered in the paper.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:45:58Z\"}"}
