The leptons and quarks belong to\\nnon-trivial representations of the modular $A_4$ and the structures of their\\nmass matrices are restricted. Neutrino masses are generated at one-loop level\\nvia leptoquark inside loop diagram where structures of relevant Yukawa\\ninteractions are determined by the modular $A_4$ symmetry. We scan the free\\nparameters in the model and try to fit all the observed data for both lepton\\nand quark sectors. For allowed parameters, we show some predictions regarding\\nneutrino observables such as sum of neutrino mass and neutrinoless double beta\\ndecay.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T08:04:16Z\"}"}
