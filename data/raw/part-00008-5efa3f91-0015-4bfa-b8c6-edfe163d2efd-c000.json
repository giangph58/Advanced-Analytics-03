More\\nparticularly, a separated ISAC design is proposed for the two-waveguide PASS,\\nwhere one waveguide is used to emit the joint communication and sensing signals\\nwhile the other waveguide is used to receive the reflected echo signals. Based\\non this framework, a penalty-based alternating optimization algorithm is\\nproposed to maximize the illumination power as well as ensure the communication\\nquality-of-service requirement. Numerical results demonstrate that 1) the\\nproposed PASS-ISAC scheme outperforms the other baseline schemes, and 2) the\\nconsidered equal power allocation model achieves a performance comparable to\\nthe optimal power allocation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T12:58:46Z\"}"}
