{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00543v1\", \"title\": \"Two-Qubit Gate Synthesis via Linear Programming for Heterogeneous\\n  Instruction Sets\", \"summary\": \"We present GULPS (Global Unitary Linear Programming Synthesis), a segmented\\nCartan trajectory method that compiles arbitrary two-qubit unitaries into\\nnative gate sets by decomposing the synthesis problem into locally solvable\\nsub-problems. Each segment corresponds to a depth-2 circuit synthesized from a\\nlinear program over canonical gate invariants, subject to quantum\\nLittlewood-Richardson (QLR) constraints. The intermediate invariants are\\nstitched together via nonlinear least-squares optimization to recover the local\\noperations between segments. This hybrid LP-numerical method enables robust\\nsynthesis across parameterized instruction sets. As quantum hardware continues\\nto evolve, GULPS provides a scalable, ISA-aware compilation strategy suitable\\nfor integration into platforms like Qiskit.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T14:13:13Z\"}"}
