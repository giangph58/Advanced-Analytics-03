In the large background field limit, all particles\\ndecouple and the Lagrangian itself remains renormalizable. We discuss the\\npotential of the results in this work to incorporate with the quark mass\\nmatrix, the hierarchy problem and the one-loop effective potential.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T06:46:08Z\"}"}
