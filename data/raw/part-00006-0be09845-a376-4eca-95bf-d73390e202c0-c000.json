While the geometrical properties of such\\ncertificate functions are well understood, synthesizing them using machine\\nlearning techniques still remains a challenge. To mitigate this issue, we\\npropose a diffeomorphic function learning framework where prior structural\\nknowledge of the desired output is encoded in the geometry of a simple\\nsurrogate function, which is subsequently augmented through an expressive,\\ntopology-preserving state-space transformation. Thereby, we achieve an indirect\\nfunction approximation framework that is guaranteed to remain in the desired\\nhypothesis space. To this end, we introduce a novel approach to construct\\ndiffeomorphic maps based on RBF networks, which facilitate precise, local\\ntransformations around data. Finally, we demonstrate our approach by learning\\ndiffeomorphic Lyapunov functions from real-world data and apply our method to\\ndifferent attractor systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:09:17Z\"}"}
