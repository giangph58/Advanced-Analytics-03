{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11252v1\", \"title\": \"Gravitationally Induced Explosive Outflows\", \"summary\": \"Over the past decade, there has been a significant increase in the reporting\\nof extensive and luminous star-forming regions associated with explosive\\noutflows. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of understanding of the possible\\nphysical mechanisms that produce such energetic and isotropic events. Then, we\\npropose a gravitational interaction as a likely mechanism that could trigger\\nexplosive outflows in dense star-forming regions. This could constrain the\\nphysical conditions that generate an explosive outflow produced by the close\\ndynamical encounter of a runaway star with a clump cluster in dynamical\\nequilibrium. Then, we have produced a set of $N$-body simulations that account\\nfor the collision of a 10M$_\\\\odot$ stellar object with a cluster of particles\\nwith a mass that ranges from 0 to 50 \\\\msun. We propose a parameter to describe\\nthe interaction, the evaporation parameter, that represents the fraction of\\nstars that become unbound. The main result is that, when the cluster mass is\\nless than, or up to a few times the stellar mass, the collision will produce an\\nexplosive outflow, ejecting a significant fraction of the cluster members with\\nvelocities larger than the impact velocity. All of our models produce an\\nexplosive outflow, with different characteristics, which increases the\\nprobability that a close encounter could be responsible for producing the\\nobserved flows.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:48:06Z\"}"}
