{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15694v1\", \"title\": \"You Sense Only Once Beneath: Ultra-Light Real-Time Underwater Object\\n  Detection\", \"summary\": \"Despite the remarkable achievements in object detection, the model's accuracy\\nand efficiency still require further improvement under challenging underwater\\nconditions, such as low image quality and limited computational resources. To\\naddress this, we propose an Ultra-Light Real-Time Underwater Object Detection\\nframework, You Sense Only Once Beneath (YSOOB). Specifically, we utilize a\\nMulti-Spectrum Wavelet Encoder (MSWE) to perform frequency-domain encoding on\\nthe input image, minimizing the semantic loss caused by underwater optical\\ncolor distortion. Furthermore, we revisit the unique characteristics of\\neven-sized and transposed convolutions, allowing the model to dynamically\\nselect and enhance key information during the resampling process, thereby\\nimproving its generalization ability. Finally, we eliminate model redundancy\\nthrough a simple yet effective channel compression and reconstructed large\\nkernel convolution (RLKC) to achieve model lightweight. As a result, forms a\\nhigh-performance underwater object detector YSOOB with only 1.2 million\\nparameters. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that, with the fewest\\nparameters, YSOOB achieves mAP50 of 83.1% and 82.9% on the URPC2020 and DUO\\ndatasets, respectively, comparable to the current SOTA detectors. The inference\\nspeed reaches 781.3 FPS and 57.8 FPS on the T4 GPU (TensorRT FP16) and the edge\\ncomputing device Jetson Xavier NX (TensorRT FP16), surpassing YOLOv12-N by\\n28.1% and 22.5%, respectively.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T08:26:35Z\"}"}
