{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21594v1\", \"title\": \"Switching Transients in Constrained Transformer-Line/Cable\\n  Configurations\", \"summary\": \"This paper investigates the transient phenomena that occur in two special\\ncases in the Netherlands: (A) during the energization of a power transformer\\nvia a cable feeder and (B) the energization of a power transformer together\\nwith an overhead line (OHL). In Case A a 7 km long 150 kV cable and a 150/50 kV\\ntransformer are connected and energized at the same time. In Case B a 150/50 kV\\ntransformer and a short 50 kV OHL are connected and energized simultaneously.\\nThe reason behind this kind of situations is related to space restrictions and\\ncost efficiency.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T12:51:59Z\"}"}
