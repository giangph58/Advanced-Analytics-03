{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21613v1\", \"title\": \"ODE and PDE models for COVID-19, with reinfection and vaccination\\n  process for Cameroon and Germany\", \"summary\": \"The goal of this work is to develop and analyze a reaction-diffusion model\\nfor the transmission dynamics of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) that accounts for\\nreinfection and vaccination, as well as to compare it to the ODE model. After\\ndeveloping a time-dependent ODE model, we calculate the control reproduction\\nnumber $\\\\mathcal{R}_c$ and demonstrate the global stability of the COVID-19\\nfree equilibrium for $\\\\mathcal{R}_c<1$. We also show that when\\n$\\\\mathcal{R}_c>1$, the free equilibrium of COVID-19 becomes unstable and\\nco-exists with at least one endemic equilibrium point. We then used data from\\nGermany and Cameroon to calibrate our model and estimate some of its\\ncharacteristics. We find $\\\\mathcal{R}_c\\\\approx 1.13$ for Germany and $\\\\mathcal\\nR_c \\\\approx 1.2554$ for Cameroon, indicating that the disease persists in both\\npopulations. Following that, we modify the prior model into a\\nreaction-diffusion PDE model to account for spatial mobility. We show that the\\nsolutions to the final initial value boundary problem (IVBP) exist and are\\nnonnegative and unique. We also show that the disease-free equilibrium is\\nstable locally, and globally when $\\\\mathcal{R}_c<1$. In contrast, when\\n$\\\\mathcal{R}_c>1$, the DFE is unstable and coexists with at least one endemic\\nequilibrium point. We ran multiple numerical simulations to validate our\\ntheoretical predictions. We then compare the ODE and the PDE models.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T13:09:44Z\"}"}
