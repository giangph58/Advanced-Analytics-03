To\\napproximate the problem, we consider a semidiscrete scheme based on the\\nvariational discretization approach. For this solution technique, we design an\\na posteriori error estimator that accounts for the discretization of the state\\nand adjoint equations, and prove, under suitable local growth conditions of\\noptimal controls, reliability and efficiency properties of such error\\nestimator. A simple adaptive strategy based on the devised estimator is\\ndesigned and its performance is illustrated with numerical examples.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.NA,math.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:07:27Z\"}"}
