The\\nscheme is based on the concept of particle paths for conservation laws and can\\nbe interpreted as a finite-particle discretization. A convergence rate of order\\n$1/2$ with respect to initial particle spacing is proved. As a special case,\\nthis covers the convergence of the Follow--the--Leader model to the\\nLighthill--Whitham--Richards model for traffic flow.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,cs.NA,math.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T07:58:28Z\"}"}
