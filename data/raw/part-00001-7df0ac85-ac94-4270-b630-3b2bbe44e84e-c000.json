Existing\\nframeworks, though designed to mitigate manual costs, often treat feature\\ntransformations as isolated operations, ignoring dynamic dependencies between\\ntransformation steps. To address the limitations, we propose TCTO, a\\ncollaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that automates\\nfeature engineering through graph-driven path optimization. The framework's\\ncore innovation lies in an evolving interaction graph that models features as\\nnodes and transformations as edges. Through graph pruning and backtracking, it\\ndynamically eliminates low-impact edges, reduces redundant operations, and\\nenhances exploration stability. This graph also provides full traceability to\\nempower TCTO to reuse high-utility subgraphs from historical transformations.\\nTo demonstrate the efficacy and adaptability of our approach, we conduct\\ncomprehensive experiments and case studies, which show superior performance\\nacross a range of datasets.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T08:16:13Z\"}"}
