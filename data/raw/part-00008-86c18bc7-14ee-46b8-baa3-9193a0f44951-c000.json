{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00356v1\", \"title\": \"Do global forecasting models require frequent retraining?\", \"summary\": \"In an era of increasing computational capabilities and growing environmental\\nconsciousness, organizations face a critical challenge in balancing the\\naccuracy of forecasting models with computational efficiency and\\nsustainability. Global forecasting models, lowering the computational time,\\nhave gained significant attention over the years. However, the common practice\\nof retraining these models with new observations raises important questions\\nabout the costs of forecasting. Using ten different machine learning and deep\\nlearning models, we analyzed various retraining scenarios, ranging from\\ncontinuous updates to no retraining at all, across two large retail datasets.\\nWe showed that less frequent retraining strategies maintain the forecast\\naccuracy while reducing the computational costs, providing a more sustainable\\napproach to large-scale forecasting. We also found that machine learning models\\nare a marginally better choice to reduce the costs of forecasting when coupled\\nwith less frequent model retraining strategies as the frequency of the data\\nincreases. Our findings challenge the conventional belief that frequent\\nretraining is essential for maintaining forecasting accuracy. Instead, periodic\\nretraining offers a good balance between predictive performance and efficiency,\\nboth in the case of point and probabilistic forecasting. These insights provide\\nactionable guidelines for organizations seeking to optimize forecasting\\npipelines while reducing costs and energy consumption.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP,stat.ML,stat.OT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T07:00:29Z\"}"}
