The Dirac equation for this configuration does not admit analytical\\nsolutions in terms of known special functions. Using the WKB approximation, we\\ndemonstrate that for gapped graphene the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition\\nfor eigenenergies includes an additional valley-dependent geometrical phase.\\nWhen this term is accounted for, the WKB approximation exhibits good agreement\\nwith results from the exact diagonalization method except to the lowest Landau\\nlevel.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T07:56:32Z\"}"}
