We introduce the concept of the maximal and the minimal Schmidt\\nranks for multipartite states. From the minimal Schmidt rank of the first order\\nwe present criterion of verifying unconditional robustness of genuine\\nmultipartite entanglement of multipartite pure states under superposition with\\nproduct pure states. By the maximal Schmidt rank of the first order we verify\\nthe unconditional robustness of multipartite inseparability under superposition\\nwith product pure states. The number of product states superposed to a given\\nentangled state which result in a separable state is investigated in detail.\\nFurthermore, the minimal Schmidt ranks of the second order are also introduced\\nto identify the unconditional robustness of an entangled state for tripartite\\ninseparability.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T10:40:31Z\"}"}
