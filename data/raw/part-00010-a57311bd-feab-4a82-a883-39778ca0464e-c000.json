While the global\\nsignificance remains at the $1.8\\\\,\\\\sigma$ level, the excess is centered around\\n$\\\\sqrt{s} \\\\sim 17\\\\,\\\\text{MeV}$, coinciding with the invariant mass at which\\nanomalous $e^+e^-$ pair production has previously been observed in nuclear\\ntransitions from excited to ground states in $^8$Be, $^4$He and $^{12}$C,\\nthereby strengthening the case for a common underlying origin, possibly\\ninvolving a hypothetical new $X_{17}$ boson. We discuss the significance of\\nthis independent accelerator-based evidence. Combining it with existing nuclear\\nphysics results, we obtain a value for the $X_{17}$ mass of $m_{X_{17}} = 16.88\\n\\\\pm 0.05\\\\,$ MeV, reducing the uncertainty from nuclear physics determinations\\nalone by more than a factor of two.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex,nucl-ex,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T17:53:40Z\"}"}
