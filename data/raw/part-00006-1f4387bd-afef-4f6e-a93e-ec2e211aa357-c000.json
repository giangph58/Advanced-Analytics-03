We emphasize two ingredients, the coupling of the\\nscalar field to gravity, and the fact that these time crystals are on an\\nexpanding FRW background, which play a crucial role in the field's dynamics.\\nThe Hubble parameter, which contributes a drag term to the equations of motion,\\ngrows with time until the scale factor diverges. When taken into account, these\\nfactors also alleviate the stability concern of [2].\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T14:34:30Z\"}"}
