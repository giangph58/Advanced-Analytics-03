{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12785v1\", \"title\": \"New developments in MatCont: delay equation importer and Lyapunov\\n  exponents\", \"summary\": \"MatCont is a powerful toolbox for numerical bifurcation analysis focussing on\\nsmooth ODEs. A user can study equilibria, periodic and connecting orbits, and\\ntheir stability and bifurcations. Here, we report on additional features in\\nversion 7p6. The first is a delay equation importer enabling MatCont users to\\nstudy a much larger class of models, namely delay equations with finite delay\\n(including delay differential and renewal equations). This importer translates\\nthe delay equation into a system of ODEs using a pseudospectral approximation\\nwith an order specified by the user. We also implemented Lyapunov exponent\\ncomputations, event functions for Poincar\\\\'e maps, and enhanced homoclinic\\ncontinuation. We demonstrate these features with test cases, such as the\\nMackey-Glass equation and a renewal equation, and provide additional examples\\nin online tutorials.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T09:33:27Z\"}"}
