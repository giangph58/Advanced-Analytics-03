{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10849v1\", \"title\": \"Real-Time Word-Level Temporal Segmentation in Streaming Speech\\n  Recognition\", \"summary\": \"Rich-text captions are essential to help communication for Deaf and\\nhard-of-hearing (DHH) people, second-language learners, and those with autism\\nspectrum disorder (ASD). They also preserve nuances when converting speech to\\ntext, enhancing the realism of presentation scripts and conversation or speech\\nlogs. However, current real-time captioning systems lack the capability to\\nalter text attributes (ex. capitalization, sizes, and fonts) at the word level,\\nhindering the accurate conveyance of speaker intent that is expressed in the\\ntones or intonations of the speech. For example, ''YOU should do this'' tends\\nto be considered as indicating ''You'' as the focus of the sentence, whereas\\n''You should do THIS'' tends to be ''This'' as the focus. This paper proposes a\\nsolution that changes the text decorations at the word level in real time. As a\\nprototype, we developed an application that adjusts word size based on the\\nloudness of each spoken word. Feedback from users implies that this system\\nhelped to convey the speaker's intent, offering a more engaging and accessible\\ncaptioning experience.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.MM,cs.SD,eess.AS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T04:17:08Z\"}"}
