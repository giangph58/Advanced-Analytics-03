{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21844v1\", \"title\": \"Scalable Multi-Task Learning for Particle Collision Event Reconstruction\\n  with Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks\", \"summary\": \"The growing luminosity frontier at the Large Hadron Collider is challenging\\nthe reconstruction and analysis of particle collision events. Increased\\nparticle multiplicities are straining latency and storage requirements at the\\ndata acquisition stage, while new complications are emerging, including higher\\nbackground levels and more frequent particle vertex misassociations. This in\\nturn necessitates the development of more holistic and scalable reconstruction\\nmethods that take advantage of recent advances in machine learning. We propose\\na novel Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN) architecture featuring unique\\nrepresentations for diverse particle collision relationships and integrated\\ngraph pruning layers for scalability. Trained with a multi-task paradigm in an\\nenvironment mimicking the LHCb experiment, this HGNN significantly improves\\nbeauty hadron reconstruction performance. Notably, it concurrently performs\\nparticle vertex association and graph pruning within a single framework. We\\nquantify reconstruction and pruning performance, demonstrate enhanced inference\\ntime scaling with event complexity, and mitigate potential performance loss\\nusing a weighted message passing scheme.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.data-an\", \"categories\": \"physics.data-an,cs.LG,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:53:08Z\"}"}
