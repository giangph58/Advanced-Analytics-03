{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15209v1\", \"title\": \"A Causal Convolutional Low-rank Representation Model for Imputation of\\n  Water Quality Data\", \"summary\": \"The monitoring of water quality is a crucial part of environmental\\nprotection, and a large number of monitors are widely deployed to monitor water\\nquality. Due to unavoidable factors such as data acquisition breakdowns,\\nsensors and communication failures, water quality monitoring data suffers from\\nmissing values over time, resulting in High-Dimensional and Sparse (HDS) Water\\nQuality Data (WQD). The simple and rough filling of the missing values leads to\\ninaccurate results and affects the implementation of relevant measures.\\nTherefore, this paper proposes a Causal convolutional Low-rank Representation\\n(CLR) model for imputing missing WQD to improve the completeness of the WQD,\\nwhich employs a two-fold idea: a) applying causal convolutional operation to\\nconsider the temporal dependence of the low-rank representation, thus\\nincorporating temporal information to improve the imputation accuracy; and b)\\nimplementing a hyperparameters adaptation scheme to automatically adjust the\\nbest hyperparameters during model training, thereby reducing the tedious manual\\nadjustment of hyper-parameters. Experimental studies on three real-world water\\nquality datasets demonstrate that the proposed CLR model is superior to some of\\nthe existing state-of-the-art imputation models in terms of imputation accuracy\\nand time cost, as well as indicating that the proposed model provides more\\nreliable decision support for environmental monitoring.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,I.2.7\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T16:27:16Z\"}"}
