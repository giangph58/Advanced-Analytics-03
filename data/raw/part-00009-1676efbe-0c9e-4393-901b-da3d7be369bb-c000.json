Focusing on the paradigmatic case of the Toda\\nchain under non-integrable Hamiltonian perturbations, this study introduces a\\nmethod based the time evolution of the Lax eigenvalues $\\\\lambda_\\\\alpha$ as a\\nproxy of the quasi-particles velocities and of the perturbed Toda actions. A\\nset of exact equations of motion for the $\\\\lambda_\\\\alpha$ is derived that\\nclosely resemble those for eigenenergies of a quantum problem (also known as\\nthe Pechukas-Yukawa gas). Numerical simulations suggest that the invariant\\nmeasure of such dynamics is basically the thermal density of states of the Toda\\nlattice, regardless of the form of the perturbation.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.SI\", \"categories\": \"nlin.SI,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T14:04:27Z\"}"}
