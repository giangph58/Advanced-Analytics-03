Mechanically exfoliated hBN flakes are\\ndry-transferred onto pre-fabricated SiN waveguides, and localized femtosecond\\nlaser irradiation is employed to induce defects with sub-microscale spatial\\nprecision. Confocal photoluminescence mapping reveals multiple laser-written\\nbright defects, among which one emitter exhibits narrow spectral linewidth and\\npolarization dependence characteristic of a dipole emitter. The emitter\\nexhibits high brightness and temporal stability, and second-order photon\\ncorrelation measurements confirm its single-photon nature. Furthermore, we\\nsuccessfully achieve on-chip excitation via the SiN waveguide, demonstrating\\nthe compatibility of our approach with mature photonic platform technologies.\\nThis deterministic integration technique offers a scalable pathway for\\nincorporating quantum emitters into photonic circuits, paving the way for the\\ndevelopment of quantum information processing and communication systems with\\ntwo-dimensional material hybrid photonic devices.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T04:34:25Z\"}"}
