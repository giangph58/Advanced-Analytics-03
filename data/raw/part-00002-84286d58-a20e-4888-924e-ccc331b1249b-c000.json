In the literature,\\nthe $B$ super $A$ graphs have been investigated by considering $A$ to be either\\npower graph, enhanced power graph, or commuting graph and $B$ to be an\\nequality, order or conjugacy relation. In this paper, we investigate the Sombor\\nspectrums of these $B$ super $A$ graphs for certain non-abelian groups, viz.\\nthe dihedral group, generalized quaternion group and the semidihedral group,\\nrespectively.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,math.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T07:34:07Z\"}"}
