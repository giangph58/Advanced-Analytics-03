We express the image volume corresponding to each specific motion phase\\nas the deformation of a single static image template. The main contribution of\\nthe work is the low-rank model for the compact joint representation of the\\nfamily of diffeomorphisms, parameterized by the motion phases. The\\ndiffeomorphism at a specific motion phase is obtained by integrating a\\nparametric velocity field along a path connecting the reference template phase\\nto the motion phase. The velocity field at different phases is represented\\nusing a low-rank model. The static template and the low-rank motion model\\nparameters are learned directly from the k-space data in an unsupervised\\nfashion. The more constrained motion model is observed to offer improved\\nrecovery compared to current motion-resolved and motion-compensated algorithms\\nfor free-breathing 3D cine MRI.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T03:52:17Z\"}"}
