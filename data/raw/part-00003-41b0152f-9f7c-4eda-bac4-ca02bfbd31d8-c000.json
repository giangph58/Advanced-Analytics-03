This paper explores\\nthe implementation of SAR4SLPs (Socially Assistive Robots for Speech-Language\\nPathologists) to investigate aspects such as engagement, therapeutic strategy\\ndiscipline, and consistent intervention support. We assessed the current\\napplication of technology to clinical and educational settings, especially with\\nrespect to how SLPs might use SAR in their therapeutic work. An asynchronous\\nremote community (ARC) collaborated with a cohort of practicing SLPs to\\nconsider the feasibility, potential effectiveness, and anticipated challenges\\nwith implementing SARs in day-to-day interventions and as practice\\nfacilitators. We focus in particular on the expressive functionality of SARs,\\nmodeling a foundational strategy that SLPs employ across various intervention\\ntargets. This paper highlights clinician-driven insights and design\\nimplications for developing SARs that support specific treatment goals through\\ncollaborative and iterative design.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T17:32:09Z\"}"}
