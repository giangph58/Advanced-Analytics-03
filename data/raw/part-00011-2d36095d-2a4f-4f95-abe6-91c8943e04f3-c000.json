It reproduces the exact analytical forms both in the\\nsmall and large amplitude limits, while in the mid-amplitude range maintains\\naverage error of 0.06% and maximum error of 0.17%. The accuracy should be\\nsufficient for typical engineering applications. Its unique simplicity should\\nbe useful in a theoretical development that requires trackable mathematical\\nframework or in an introductory physics course that aims to discuss a finite\\namplitude pendulum. A simple and formally exact solution of angular\\ndisplacement for the full range of amplitudes is illustrated.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.class-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.class-ph,math-ph,math.MP,nlin.SI,physics.comp-ph,physics.ed-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:35:11Z\"}"}
