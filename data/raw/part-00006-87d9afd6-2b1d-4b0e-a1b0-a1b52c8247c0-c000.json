In this model, the Penalized Comparison to Overfitting\\nprocedure is studied for the weighted $\\\\ell_p$-loss, $p\\\\geq 1.$ Several oracle\\ninequalities are derived from concentration inequalities for sub-Weibull\\nvariables. Using judicious collections of models and penalty terms, minimax\\nrates of convergence are stated for Besov bodies $\\\\mathcal{B}_{r,\\\\infty}^s$.\\nThese results are applied to the functional model of nonparametric regression.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:20:44Z\"}"}
