Using an accordion\\nlattice with adjustable spacing, we prepare a Bose-Einstein condensate of\\ncesium atoms across a defined number of lattice sites. By quenching the\\ninteraction strength and the trapping potential, we generate both single-site\\nand multi-site solitons. Our results reveal the existence and characteristics\\nof these solitons across a range of lattice depths and spacings. We identify\\nstable regions of the solitons, based on interaction strength and lattice\\nproperties, and compare these findings with theoretical predictions. Our\\nresults provide insights into the quench dynamics and collapse mechanisms,\\npaving the way for further studies on transport and dynamical properties of\\nmatter-wave solitons in lattices.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas,nlin.PS,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T10:17:12Z\"}"}
