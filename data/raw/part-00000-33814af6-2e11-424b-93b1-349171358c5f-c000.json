{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21727v1\", \"title\": \"Enhancing Underwater Navigation through Cross-Correlation-Aware Deep\\n  INS/DVL Fusion\", \"summary\": \"The accurate navigation of autonomous underwater vehicles critically depends\\non the precision of Doppler velocity log (DVL) velocity measurements. Recent\\nadvancements in deep learning have demonstrated significant potential in\\nimproving DVL outputs by leveraging spatiotemporal dependencies across multiple\\nsensor modalities. However, integrating these estimates into model-based\\nfilters, such as the extended Kalman filter, introduces statistical\\ninconsistencies, most notably, cross-correlations between process and\\nmeasurement noise. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a\\ncross-correlation-aware deep INS/DVL fusion framework. Building upon BeamsNet,\\na convolutional neural network designed to estimate AUV velocity using DVL and\\ninertial data, we integrate its output into a navigation filter that explicitly\\naccounts for the cross-correlation induced between the noise sources. This\\napproach improves filter consistency and better reflects the underlying sensor\\nerror structure. Evaluated on two real-world underwater trajectories, the\\nproposed method outperforms both least squares and cross-correlation-neglecting\\napproaches in terms of state uncertainty. Notably, improvements exceed 10% in\\nvelocity and misalignment angle confidence metrics. Beyond demonstrating\\nempirical performance, this framework provides a theoretically principled\\nmechanism for embedding deep learning outputs within stochastic filters.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:38:43Z\"}"}
