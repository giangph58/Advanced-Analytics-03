{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24314v1\", \"title\": \"Impact of Synchronization Offsets and CSI Feedback Delay in Distributed\\n  MIMO Systems\", \"summary\": \"The main challenges of distributed MIMO systems lie in achieving highly\\naccurate synchronization and ensuring the availability of accurate channel\\nstate information (CSI) at distributed nodes. This paper analytically examines\\nthe effects of synchronization offsets and CSI feedback delays on system\\ncapacity, providing insights into how these affect the coherent joint\\ntransmission gain. The capacity expressions are first derived under ideal\\nconditions, and the effects of synchronization offsets and feedback delays are\\nsubsequently incorporated. This analysis can be applied to any distributed MIMO\\narchitecture. A comprehensive study, including system models and simulations\\nevaluating the analytical expressions, is presented to quantify the capacity\\ndegradation caused by these factors. This study provides valuable insights into\\nthe design and performance of distributed MIMO systems. The analysis shows that\\ntime and frequency offsets, along with CSI feedback delay, cause inter-layer\\ninterference. Additionally, time offsets result in inter-symbol interference.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:02:33Z\"}"}
