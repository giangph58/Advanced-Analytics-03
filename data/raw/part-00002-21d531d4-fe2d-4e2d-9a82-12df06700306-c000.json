To achieve this, we\\npropose a novel graph-based algorithm with two key features: it is applicable\\nto non-orientable surfaces, thereby generalizing previous approaches, and it\\nhas a worst-case time complexity that is linear in the number of edges of the\\nmesh $\\\\mathcal{K}$ triangulating $\\\\Gamma$. Importantly, this algorithm serves\\nas a critical pre-processing step to address the low-frequency breakdown\\nencountered in boundary element discretizations of integral equation\\nformulations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:28:47Z\"}"}
