For a fixed\\nobservation function $c$, we develop a theory to optimise the response of the\\nSRB-expectation of $c$. Our approach is based on the response of the transfer\\noperator on the anisotropic Banach spaces of Gou\\\\\\\"ezel-Liverani. For any\\nnon-constant $c$ we prove that the optimising perturbation $T_2$ exists and is\\nunique, and we provide explicit expressions for the Fourier coefficients of\\n$T_2$. We develop an efficient Fourier-based numerical scheme to approximate\\nthe optimal vector field $T_2$, along with a proof of convergence. The utility\\nof our approach is illustrated in two numerical examples, by localising SRB\\nmeasures with small, optimally selected, perturbations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T08:57:40Z\"}"}
