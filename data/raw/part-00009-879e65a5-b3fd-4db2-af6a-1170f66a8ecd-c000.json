We establish\\na general framework for the analysis of the local regularity of such solutions\\nfor a class of two-dimensional Riemann problems for the isentropic Euler\\nsystem, which includes the regular shock reflection problem, the Prandtl\\nreflection problem, the Lighthill diffraction problem, and the four-shock\\nRiemann problem. We prove that it is not possible that both the density and the\\nvelocity are in $H^1$ in the subsonic domain for the self-similar solutions of\\nthese problems in general. This indicates that the self-similar solutions of\\nthe Riemann problems with shocks for the isentropic Euler system are of much\\nmore complicated structure than those for the Euler system for potential flow;\\nin particular, the density and the velocity are not necessarily continuous in\\nthe subsonic domain. The proof is based on a regularization of the isentropic\\nEuler system to derive the transport equation for the vorticity, a\\nrenormalization argument extended to the case of domains with boundary, and\\nDiPerna-Lions-type commutator estimates.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math-ph,math.MP,nlin.PS,physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T16:48:12Z\"}"}
