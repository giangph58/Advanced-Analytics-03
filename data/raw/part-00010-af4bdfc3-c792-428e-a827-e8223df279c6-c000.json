In\\nparticular, it is the classical gravitational, Coulomb or photo-gravitational\\n$n$-body problem. Under this general form of interaction, we investigate the\\nintegrability problem of three bodies. We show that the system is not\\nintegrable except in one case when two among three interaction constants\\nvanish. In our investigation, we used the Morales-Ramis theorem concerning the\\nintegrability of a natural Hamiltonian system with a homogeneous potential and\\nits generalization.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.CD\", \"categories\": \"nlin.CD\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T06:56:06Z\"}"}
