{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11917v1\", \"title\": \"Dirac Representation for Lattice Spin Operators: Spin-$1/2$ and Spin-$1$\\n  cases\", \"summary\": \"A novel quantum representation of lattice spin operators (LSOs) is achieved\\nby mapping quantum spins onto their classical analogues for spin size $S=1/2$\\nand $S=1$. The \\\"braket\\\" representations of LSOs are attained thanks to a\\nprofound inspection into the binary/ternary distribution of classical\\nbits/trits in non-negative integers. We claim the possility of getting the\\n$j$th digit of a positive integer without performing any binary/ternary\\ndecomposition. Analytical formulas returning the $j$th bits/trits of an integer\\nare presented. Impacts of our achievements in Physics are highlighted by\\nrevisiting the $1D$ spin-$1/2$ {XXZ} Heisenberg model with open boundaries in a\\nmagnetic field in both absence (uniform magnetic field) and presence of\\ndisorder (random magnetic field). In the absence of disorder (clean system), we\\ndemonstrate that the corresponding eigenvalues problem can be reduced to a\\ntight-binding problem on a graph and solved without resorting to any spinless\\ntransformation nor the Bethe Anzath. In the presence of disorder, a convergent\\nperturbation theory is elaborated. Our analytical results are compared with\\ndata from exact diagonalization for relatively large spin systems ($K\\\\leq 18$\\nspins with $K$ denoting the total number of spins) obtained by implementing\\nboth the global $U(1)$ symmetry to block-diagonalize the Hamiltonian and the\\nspin-inversion symmetry for two-fold block-diagonalization in the sector with\\ntotal magnetization $\\\\mathcal{J}^z=0$. We observe a good agreement between both\\nresults.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T09:54:35Z\"}"}
