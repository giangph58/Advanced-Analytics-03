We study the applications of\\nseminorms for this goal. We revisit a previously suggested family of seminorms\\nand correct an error made in their original presentation where it was claimed\\nthat the a certain seminorm is equal to the well-known coefficient of\\nergodicity. We then propose a wider family of seminorms which guarantee\\nconvergence at an exponential rate of infinite products of matrices which\\ngeneralizes known results on stochastic matrices to the class of matrices whose\\nrow sums are all equal one. Finally, we show that such seminorms cannot be used\\nto bound the rate of convergence of classes larger than the well-known class of\\nscrambling matrices, and pose several open questions for future research.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T17:19:57Z\"}"}
