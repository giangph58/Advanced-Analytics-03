Although the non-equilibrium optical response encodes both local (quasi\\natomic) and collective (long range) responses, optical spectroscopy is usually\\nmore sensitive to the latter. Resonant x-ray techniques are better suited to\\ninvestigate the quasi-atomic properties of correlated solids. Using\\ntime-resolved resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS), here we study the\\nultrafast non-equilibrium processes in NiO following photo-excitation by\\nultraviolet photons with energy exceeding the optical gap. We observe the\\ncreation of charge-transfer excitons that decay with a time constant of about\\n2\\\\,ps, while itinerant photo-doping persists for tens of picoseconds. Following\\nour discovery, which establishes time-resolved high-resolution RIXS as a\\npowerful tool for the study of transient phenomena in condensed matter, the\\npossible presence of charge-transfer excitons will need to be considered when\\ninterpreting optical pump-probe experiments on correlated quantum materials.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T12:19:33Z\"}"}
