We introduce\\nquantitative X-ray schlieren nanotomography (XSN), a simple, fast, and\\nhigh-resolution X-ray phase imaging technique that overcomes these limitations.\\nXSN employs a partially coherent illumination and a pupil-plane cutoff filter\\nto encode directional phase contrast, enabling single-shot acquisition. A\\nquasi-Newton iterative algorithm reconstructs quantitative phase and absorption\\nimages from intensity data, even under strong scattering conditions. Scanning\\nacross X-ray energies further allows four-dimensional imaging (3D spatial &\\nspectral). We validate the method's accuracy and resolution on reference\\nsamples and apply it to lithium battery cathodes, visualizing nanoscale\\nmicrocracks and mapping chemical compositions. XSN provides a robust framework\\nfor hyperspectral phase nanotomography with broad applicability across\\nmaterials science, biology, and energy research.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T08:30:36Z\"}"}
