We study the strongly\\nRayleigh property within this class and explicitly find a distribution that\\nsatisfies this property by maximizing the entropy. Furthermore, we construct a\\nchain for the supermodular order starting from extremal negative dependence to\\nindependence by mixing the maximum entropy strongly Rayleigh distribution with\\nindependence.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:52:58Z\"}"}
