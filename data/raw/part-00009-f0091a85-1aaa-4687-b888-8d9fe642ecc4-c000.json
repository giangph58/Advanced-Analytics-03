In this work, we show\\nthat modern retrieval systems often reach a point where re-ranking can degrade\\nresults, as current VPR datasets are largely saturated. We propose using image\\nmatching as a verification step to assess retrieval confidence, demonstrating\\nthat inlier counts can reliably predict when re-ranking is beneficial. Our\\nfindings shift the paradigm of retrieval pipelines, offering insights for more\\nrobust and adaptive VPR systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T15:10:10Z\"}"}
