A peculiar comb state is the harmonic frequency comb (HFC), where\\noptical lines are spaced by integer multiples of the cavity's free-spectral\\nrange. The spontaneous formation of HFCs has recently been observed in\\nsemiconductor lasers with fast gain recovery, such as Quantum Cascade Lasers\\n(QCLs), although the underlying physical mechanism remains unclear. In this\\nwork, we provide a physical interpretation for the formation of HFCs in QCLs,\\nbased on a resonance phenomenon between an effective Rabi frequency and a mode\\nof the laser cavity. This is corroborated by the results of the numerical\\nintegration of the effective semiconductor Maxwell-Bloch equations used to\\ndescribe the multimode laser dynamics, as well as by the linear stability\\nanalysis of the continuous wave emission at threshold.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T13:15:17Z\"}"}
