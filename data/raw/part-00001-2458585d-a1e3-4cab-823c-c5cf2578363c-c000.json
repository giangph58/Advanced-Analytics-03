As $a\\\\rightarrow 0$, we get back $y=mx$ which is a\\ncumulative distribution function of a continuous uniform distribution that\\ndescribes the occurrence of every event in an interval to be equally probable.\\nAs $a\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty$, the derivative of $y$ has finite support only at $y=0$\\nresembling a degenerate distribution. Based on these arguments, in this work,\\nwe propose that these S-curves can represent maximum entropy uniform\\ndistribution to a zero entropy single value. We also argue that these S-curves\\nare superposable as they are only parametrically nonlinear but fundamentally\\nlinear. So far, the superposed forms have been used to capture the patterns of\\nnatural systems such as nonlinear dynamics of biological growth and kinetics of\\nenzyme reactions. Here, we attempt to use the S-curve and its superposed form\\nas a statistical model. We fit the models on a classical dataset containing\\nflower measurements of iris plants and analyze their usefulness in pattern\\nrecognition. Based on these models, we claim that any non-uniform pattern can\\nbe represented as a singular perturbation to uniform distribution. However, our\\nparametric estimation procedure have some limitations such as sensitivity to\\ninitial conditions depending on the data at hand.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T05:08:02Z\"}"}
