This is\\nconventionally true for f-electron systems, where the extent of the f-electrons\\nand their associated crystal-electric-field (CEF) states are strongly\\nlocalized. Here, polarized Raman spectroscopy measurements of a locally\\nnon-centrosymmetric compound, CeCoSi, unveil more CEF excitations than expected\\nin the local model. We interpret this as experimental evidence for the\\nentanglement of CEF states between cerium layers. This composite sublattice,\\nspin, and orbital degree of freedom provides an unconsidered means to form\\nnovel orders, not only in this system, but in any system exhibiting globally\\npreserved yet locally broken centrosymmetry.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T07:21:32Z\"}"}
