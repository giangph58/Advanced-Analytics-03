By integrating rigorous theoretical quantum electrodynamics\\ncalculations, state-of-the-art numerical methods, and a systematic reanalysis\\nof the uncertainties, we reduced the long-standing muonic fine-structure\\nanomaly and improved the goodness of fit by a factor of twenty. The resulting\\nvalue of 5.5062(5) fm is fairly consistent with the previously reported muonic\\nspectroscopy value, and three standard deviations larger than the commonly used\\ncompilation data, which indicates that the current value and its uncertainty\\ncould be significantly underestimated. Our study paves a new path for\\nsystematic reevaluation of all rms radii based on muonic spectroscopy.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:49:59Z\"}"}
