{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05129v1\", \"title\": \"Superconductivity, Anomalous Hall Effect, and Stripe Order in\\n  Rhombohedral Hexalayer Graphene\", \"summary\": \"We report the discovery of a unique superconducting phase in rhombohedral\\nhexalayer graphene characterized by its simultaneous emergence with both the\\nanomalous Hall effect and stripe charge order. The onset of stripe charge order\\nis revealed through angle-resolved transport measurements, which show thermally\\nactivated insulating behavior along one axis and highly conductive transport\\nalong the orthogonal direction. Superconductivity develops exclusively along\\nthe high-conductivity axis, giving rise to a one-dimensional-like\\nsuperconducting channel. This superconducting state exhibits first-order\\ntransitions under an out-of-plane magnetic field, consistent with a chiral\\norder parameter that breaks time-reversal symmetry. Most remarkably, thermally\\ndriven superconducting transitions display pronounced hysteresis-an uncommon\\nphenomenon that reflects the complex interplay among stripe formation, broken\\ntime-reversal symmetry, and superconductivity. Together, these results uncover\\na previously unidentified quantum phase: a chiral superconductor embedded\\nwithin an anomalous Hall crystal.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:33:00Z\"}"}
