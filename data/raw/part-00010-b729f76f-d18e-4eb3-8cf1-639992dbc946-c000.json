We also prove that predicting sentence level embedding of\\na summary increases the quality of an end-to-end system for loosely aligned\\nsource to target corpora, than compared to commonly predicting probability\\ndistributions of sentence selection.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T12:34:59Z\"}"}
