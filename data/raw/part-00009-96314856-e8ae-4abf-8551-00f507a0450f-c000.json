This subsystem symmetry has an 't Hooft anomaly, which is captured by\\na subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phase in one dimension higher\\nvia the anomaly inflow mechanism. By analyzing both the anomaly inflow\\nstructure and the foliated-exotic duality in the SSPT phases, we establish the\\nfoliated-exotic duality in the $\\\\phi$-theories. Furthermore, we also\\ninvestigate the foliated-exotic duality in the $\\\\hat\\\\phi$-theory, which is dual\\nto the $\\\\phi$-theory, and construct the foliated $\\\\hat\\\\phi$-theory. These are\\nthe first examples of the foliated-exotic duality in gapless theories.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T03:26:33Z\"}"}
