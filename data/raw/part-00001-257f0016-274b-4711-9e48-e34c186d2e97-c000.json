In this paper,\\nwe propose DetMCVI, an adaptation of the Monte Carlo Value Iteration (MCVI)\\nalgorithm for DetPOMDPs, which builds policies in the form of finite-state\\ncontrollers (FSCs). DetMCVI solves large problems with a high success rate,\\noutperforming existing baselines for DetPOMDPs. We also verify the performance\\nof the algorithm in a real-world mobile robot forest mapping scenario.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T15:30:26Z\"}"}
