{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21279v1\", \"title\": \"Linear perturbations of dyonic black holes in the lowest-order $U(1)$\\n  gauge-invariant scalar-vector-tensor theories\", \"summary\": \"We study linear perturbations on top of the static and spherically symmetric\\nbackground of dyonic black hole solutions endowed with electric and magnetic\\ncharges, as well as a scalar hair, in the lowest-order $U(1)$ gauge-invariant\\nscalar-vector-tensor theories. The presence of magnetic charges in the\\nbackground solutions gives rise to a mixing between the odd-parity and\\neven-parity sectors of perturbations, which makes it impossible to analyze each\\nsector separately. Thus, we expand the action up to second order in both\\nodd-parity and even-parity perturbations and derive the general conditions for\\nthe absence of ghosts and Laplacian instabilities. We apply these general\\nconditions to extended Einstein-Maxwell theories, which encompass a wide\\nvariety of concrete models from the literature known to have dyonic black hole\\nsolutions with the scalar hair, and examine their stabilities. Our general\\nframework for studying stability conditions and dynamics of perturbations can\\nbe applied to a wide variety of theories, including nonlinear electrodynamics\\ncoupled to a scalar field, as well as to calculations of black hole quasinormal\\nmodes.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T03:20:03Z\"}"}
