{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04605v1\", \"title\": \"I-Love-Q Relations of Fermion-Boson Stars\", \"summary\": \"We investigate the properties of fermion-boson stars (FBSs), which can be\\nviewed as neutron stars with a bosonic dark matter (DM) admixture. A challenge\\nin studying the impact of DM on neutron stars is the absence of a universally\\naccepted nuclear-matter equation of state (EOS), making it difficult to\\ndistinguish between the effects of DM and various EOS models. To address this\\nissue, we extend the study of the I-Love-Q universal relations of neutron stars\\nto FBSs with a nonrotating bosonic component by solving the\\nEinstein-Klein-Gordon system. We study how DM parameters, such as the boson\\nparticle mass and self-interaction strength, would affect the structure of FBSs\\nand explore the parameter space that leads to deviations from the I-Love-Q\\nrelations. The properties of FBSs and the level of deviations in general depend\\nsensitively on the DM parameters. For boson particle mass within the range of\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}(10^{-10} \\\\ \\\\mathrm{eV})$, where the Compton wavelength is\\ncomparable to the Schwarzschild radius of a $1 M_\\\\odot$ star, the deviation is\\nup to about 5% level if the star contains a few percent of DM admixture. The\\ndeviation increases significantly with a higher amount of DM. We also find that\\nthe universal relations are still valid to within a 1% deviation level for\\nboson particle mass $m_b \\\\geq 26.8\\\\times10^{-10} \\\\ \\\\mathrm{eV}$. This\\neffectively sets an upper bound on the boson particle mass, beyond which it\\nbecomes not feasible to probe the properties of FBSs by investigating the\\nI-Love-Q relation violations.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.SR,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T17:50:38Z\"}"}
