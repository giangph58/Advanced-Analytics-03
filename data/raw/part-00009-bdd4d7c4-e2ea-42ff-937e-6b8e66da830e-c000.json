The second is that certain classes of unlensed GWs could mimic\\nmicrolensed GWs, resulting in undesirable false alarms. In this work, we\\npropose to use the Kramers-Kronig relation for gravitational lensing systems.\\nWe argue that such systems are essentially linear response systems obeying\\ncausality, where KK relation must hold. The power of this method lies in the\\nfact that microlensed GWs, regardless of the lens structure, must obey KK\\nrelation, while unlensed GW events are not in general expected to obey it.\\nThis, in principle, allows us to identify microlensed GWs while dismissing\\nmicrolensing mimickers. We provide the first important steps towards a\\nmethodology that exploits KK relation, and test its usefulness under idealized\\nconditions.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T05:11:44Z\"}"}
