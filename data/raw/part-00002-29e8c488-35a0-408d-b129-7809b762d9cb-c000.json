{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00338v1\", \"title\": \"New Distributed Interactive Proofs for Planarity: A Matter of Left and\\n  Right\", \"summary\": \"We provide new distributed interactive proofs (DIP) for planarity and related\\ngraph families. The notion of a \\\\emph{distributed interactive proof} (DIP) was\\nintroduced by Kol, Oshman, and Saxena (PODC 2018). In this setting, the\\nverifier consists of $n$ nodes connected by a communication graph $G$. The\\nprover is a single entity that communicates with all nodes by short messages.\\nThe goal is to verify that the graph $G$ satisfies a certain property (e.g.,\\nplanarity) in a small number of rounds, and with a small communication bound,\\ndenoted as the \\\\emph{proof size}.\\n  Prior work by Naor, Parter and Yogev (SODA 2020) presented a DIP for\\nplanarity that uses three interaction rounds and a proof size of $O(\\\\log n)$.\\nFeuilloley et al.\\\\ (PODC 2020) showed that the same can be achieved with a\\nsingle interaction round and without randomization, by providing a proof\\nlabeling scheme with a proof size of $O(\\\\log n)$. In a subsequent work,\\nBousquet, Feuilloley, and Pierron (OPODIS 2021) achieved the same bound for\\nrelated graph families such as outerplanarity, series-parallel graphs, and\\ngraphs of treewidth at most $2$. In this work, we design new DIPs that use\\nexponentially shorter proofs compared to the state-of-the-art bounds.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS,cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T06:35:42Z\"}"}
