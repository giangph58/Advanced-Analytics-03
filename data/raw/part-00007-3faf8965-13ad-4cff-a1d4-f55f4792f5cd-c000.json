{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15830v1\", \"title\": \"Predictive Synthesis of Control Barrier Functions and its Application to\\n  Time-Varying Constraints\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents a systematic method for synthesizing a Control Barrier\\nFunction (CBF) that encodes predictive information into a CBF. Unlike other\\nmethods, the synthesized CBF can account for changes and time-variations in the\\nconstraints even when constructed for time-invariant constraints. This avoids\\nrecomputing the CBF when the constraint specifications change. The method\\nprovides an explicit characterization of the extended class K function {\\\\alpha}\\nthat determines the dynamic properties of the CBF, and {\\\\alpha} can even be\\nexplicitly chosen as a design parameter in the controller synthesis. The\\nresulting CBF further accounts for input constraints, and its values can be\\ndetermined at any point without having to compute the CBF over the entire\\ndomain. The synthesis method is based on a finite horizon optimal control\\nproblem inspired by Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis and does not rely on\\na nominal control law. The synthesized CBF is time-invariant if the constraints\\nare. The method poses mild assumptions on the controllability of the dynamic\\nsystem and assumes the knowledge of at least a subset of some control invariant\\nset. The paper provides a detailed analysis of the properties of the\\nsynthesized CBF, including its application to time-varying constraints. A\\nsimulation study applies the proposed approach to various dynamic systems in\\nthe presence of time-varying constraints. The paper is accompanied by an online\\navailable parallelized implementation of the proposed synthesis method.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T12:21:16Z\"}"}
