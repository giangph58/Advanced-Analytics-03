{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10897v1\", \"title\": \"SCOOP: A Scalable Quantum-Computing Framework to Constrained\\n  Combinatorial Optimization\", \"summary\": \"While the ultimate goal of solving computationally intractable problems is to\\nfind a provably optimal solutions, practical constraints of real-world\\nscenarios often necessitate focusing on efficiently obtaining high-quality,\\nnear-optimal solutions. The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)\\nis a state-of-the-art hybrid quantum-classical approach for tackling these\\nchallenging problems that are encoded using quadratic and higher-order\\nunconstrained binary optimization problems (QUBO and HUBO). We present SCOOP, a\\nnovel QAOA-based framework for solving constrained optimization problems. SCOOP\\ntransforms a constrained problem into an unconstrained counterpart, forming\\nSCOOP problem twins. The QAOA quantum algorithm operates on the unconstrained\\ntwin to identify potential optimal and near-optimal solutions. Effective\\nclassical post-processing reduces the solution set to the constrained problem\\nspace. Our SCOOP approach is solution-enhanced, objective-function-compatible,\\nand scalable. We demonstrate the framework on three NP-hard problems, Minimum\\nDominating Set, Minimum Maximal Matching, and Minimum Set Cover appearing in\\npractical application domains such as resource allocation, communication\\nnetworks, and machine learning. We validate SCOOP's feasibility and\\neffectiveness on Xanadu PennyLane simulators.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T06:17:23Z\"}"}
