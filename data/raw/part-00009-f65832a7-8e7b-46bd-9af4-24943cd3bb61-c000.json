{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05885v1\", \"title\": \"Comprehensive UV and Optical spectral analysis of Cygnus X-1: Stellar\\n  and wind parameters, abundances, and evolutionary implications\", \"summary\": \"We present a comprehensive analysis of Cyg X-1, utilizing archival\\nhigh-resolution UV and optical spectra in conjunction with sophisticated\\natmospheric models. Notably, this is the first investigation to simultaneously\\nanalyze UV and optical spectra of Cyg X-1 along with incorporating X-rays to\\nconstrain the stellar and wind parameters. Our analysis yields notably lower\\nmasses for both the donor (29$\\\\,M_\\\\odot$) and the black hole (12.7 to\\n17.8$\\\\,M_\\\\odot$, depending on inclination), and confirms that the donor's\\nradius is close to reaching the inner Lagrangian point. We find super-solar Fe,\\nSi, and Mg abundances (1.3-1.8 times solar) at the surface of the donor star,\\nwhile the total CNO abundance remains solar despite evidence of CNO processing\\n(N enrichment, O depletion) and He enrichment. This abundance pattern is\\ndistinct from the surrounding Cyg OB3 association. We observe a clear\\ndifference in wind parameters between X-ray states: $v_\\\\infty \\\\approx\\n1200\\\\,\\\\mathrm{km\\\\,s}^{-1}$ and $\\\\dot{M} \\\\approx 3\\\\times\\n10^{-7}\\\\,M_\\\\odot\\\\,\\\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ in the high/soft state, increasing to\\n$v_\\\\infty\\\\lesssim 1800\\\\,\\\\mathrm{km\\\\,s}^{-1}$ and $\\\\dot{M}\\\\lesssim 5\\\\times\\n10^{-7}\\\\,M_\\\\odot\\\\,\\\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ in the low/hard state. The observed X-ray\\nluminosity is consistent with wind-fed accretion. Evolutionary models show that\\nCyg X-1 will undergo Roche lobe overflow in the near future. Under a fully\\nconservative mass accretion scenario, our models predict a future binary black\\nhole merger for Cyg X-1 within $\\\\sim5$ Gyr. Our comprehensive analysis provides\\nrefined stellar and wind parameters of the donor star in Cyg X-1, highlighting\\nthe importance of using advanced atmospheric models and considering X-ray\\nionization and wind clumping. The observed abundances suggest a complex\\nformation history involving a high initial metallicity.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T10:18:57Z\"}"}
