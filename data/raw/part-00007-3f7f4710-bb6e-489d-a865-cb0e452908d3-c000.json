In\\nsemiconductor structures and, in particular, in the well-established (Al,Ga)As\\nmaterial system, strong emission lines with nanosecond coherence times can be\\nprovided by the opto-electronic resonances of microcavity exciton-polariton\\ncondensates. The temporal coherence of these resonances, however, normally\\nrapidly deteriorates as the temperature increases beyond a few tens of kelvins\\ndue to exciton dissociation. Here, we demonstrate that the temperature\\nstability of polariton condensates in (Al,Ga)As can be significantly improved\\nby confinement within micrometer-sized intracavity traps. We show that trapped\\ncondensates can survive up to ~200 K while maintaining a light-matter character\\nwith decoherence rates below 10 GHz (i.e., $< 40 {\\\\mu}$eV linewidths). These\\nlinewidths are by an order of magnitude smaller than those so far reported for\\nother solid-state systems at these temperatures. Confinement thus provides a\\npathway towards room-temperature polariton condensation using the\\nwell-established (Al,Ga)As material system with prospects for application in\\nscalable on-chip photonic devices for optical processing, sensing, and\\ncomputing.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.quant-gas,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T09:11:45Z\"}"}
