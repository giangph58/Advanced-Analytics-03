{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00547v1\", \"title\": \"From Requirements to Test Cases: An NLP-Based Approach for\\n  High-Performance ECU Test Case Automation\", \"summary\": \"Automating test case specification generation is vital for improving the\\nefficiency and accuracy of software testing, particularly in complex systems\\nlike high-performance Electronic Control Units (ECUs). This study investigates\\nthe use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including Rule-Based\\nInformation Extraction and Named Entity Recognition (NER), to transform natural\\nlanguage requirements into structured test case specifications. A dataset of\\n400 feature element documents from the Polarion tool was used to evaluate both\\napproaches for extracting key elements such as signal names and values. The\\nresults reveal that the Rule-Based method outperforms the NER method, achieving\\n95% accuracy for more straightforward requirements with single signals, while\\nthe NER method, leveraging SVM and other machine learning algorithms, achieved\\n77.3% accuracy but struggled with complex scenarios. Statistical analysis\\nconfirmed that the Rule-Based approach significantly enhances efficiency and\\naccuracy compared to manual methods. This research highlights the potential of\\nNLP-driven automation in improving quality assurance, reducing manual effort,\\nand expediting test case generation, with future work focused on refining NER\\nand hybrid models to handle greater complexity.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T14:23:55Z\"}"}
