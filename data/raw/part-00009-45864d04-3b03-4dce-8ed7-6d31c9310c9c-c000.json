{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03504v1\", \"title\": \"Heavy traffic limit of stationary distribution of the multi-level single\\n  server queue\", \"summary\": \"Atar and Miyazawa recently introduced a single server queue with queue length\\ndependent arrival and service processes, and name it a multi-level queue. They\\nprove that the heavy traffic limit of its queue length process weakly converges\\nto a reflected diffusion with discontinuously state-dependent drift and\\ndeviations.\\n  We derive the heavy traffic limit of the stationary queue length distribution\\nof this multi-level queue in a closed form, which agrees with the stationary\\ndistribution of the reflected diffusion obtained by Miyazawa (2024, Journal of\\nthe Indian Society for Probability and Statistics). Thus, those results show\\nthe limit interchange of process and stationary distribution in heavy traffic.\\n  The multi-level queue is a simpler version of the 2-level GI/G/1 queue of\\nMiyazawa (2025, Advances in Applied Probability, to appear) and its extension\\nfor multi-levels. For this 2-level queue in heavy traffic, the process limit is\\nunknown, and the distributional limit is obtained for limited cases under extra\\nconditions. Nevertheless, it is shown that the method developed in Miyazawa\\n(2025) perfectly works for the present multi-level queue.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T13:10:04Z\"}"}
