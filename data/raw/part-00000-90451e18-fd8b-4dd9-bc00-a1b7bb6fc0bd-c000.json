The continuum discretized coupled channel(CDCC)\\ncalculations are carried out in a nonstandard way, using short-range imaginary\\npotentials for the fragment-target interaction at energies close to the Coulomb\\nbarrier. The present calculations employing short-range imaginary potentials\\nexhibit better agreement with the experimental elastic scattering angular\\ndistributions than those using standard systematic value (0.78xWSPP ) used to\\ndescribe elastic scattering. Including the excitation of the 232Th inelastic\\nshows significant coupling effects on the elastic scattering below the barrier\\nenergies compared to higher incident energies. Subsequently, the CDCC framework\\nwas used to analyze the nuclear, Coulomb, and total breakup predictions\\nseparately. The breakup cross sections for the 6Li+232Th system are greater\\nthan those for the 7Li+232Th system across various energies. The present study\\npredicts destructive Coulomb-nuclear interference in the breakup processes\\ninvolving both 6Li and 7Li projectile nuclei with the deformed 232Th target.\\nAdditionally, the breakup reaction cross-sections are compared with\\nexperimentally measured fusion cross-sections near the barrier energies for\\nboth 6,7Li+232Th systems.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:07:28Z\"}"}
