{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10125v1\", \"title\": \"An initial-boundary corrected splitting method for diffusion-reaction\\n  problems\", \"summary\": \"Strang splitting is a widely used second-order method for solving\\ndiffusion-reaction problems. However, its convergence order is often reduced to\\norder $1$ for Dirichlet boundary conditions and to order $1.5$ for Neumann and\\nRobin boundary conditions, leading to lower accuracy and reduced efficiency. In\\nthis paper, we propose a new splitting approach, called an initial-boundary\\ncorrected splitting, which avoids order reduction while improving computational\\nefficiency for a wider range of applications. In contrast to the corrections\\nproposed in the literature, it does not require the computation of correction\\nterms that depend on the boundary conditions and boundary data. Through\\nrigorous analytical convergence analysis and numerical experiments, we\\ndemonstrate the improved accuracy and performance of the proposed method.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T11:32:33Z\"}"}
