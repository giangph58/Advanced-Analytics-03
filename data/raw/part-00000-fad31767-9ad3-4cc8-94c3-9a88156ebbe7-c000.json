Enforcer wins\\nif, by the time all vertices of H have been selected, Avoider has completely\\nfilled an edge of H with her vertices; otherwise, Avoider wins. In this paper,\\nwe first give some general results, in particular regarding the outcome of the\\ngame and disjoint unions of hypergraphs. We then determine which player has a\\nwinning strategy for all hypergraphs of rank 2, and for linear hypergraphs of\\nrank 3 when Avoider plays the last move. The structural characterisations we\\nobtain yield polynomial-time algorithms.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,cs.DM\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T16:40:37Z\"}"}
