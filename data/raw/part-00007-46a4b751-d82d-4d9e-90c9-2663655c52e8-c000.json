{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15081v1\", \"title\": \"PID-GM: PID Control with Gain Mapping\", \"summary\": \"Proportional-Integral-Differential (PID) control is widely used in industrial\\ncontrol systems. However, up to now there are at least two open problems\\nrelated with PID control. One is to have a comprehensive understanding of its\\nrobustness with respect to model uncertainties and disturbances. The other is\\nto build intuitive, explicit and mathematically provable guidelines for PID\\ngain tuning. In this paper, we introduce a simple nonlinear mapping to\\ndetermine PID gains from three auxiliary parameters. By the mapping, PID\\ncontrol is shown to be equivalent to a new PD control (serving as a nominal\\ncontrol) plus an uncertainty and disturbance compensator (to recover the\\nnominal performance). Then PID control can be understood, designed and tuned in\\na Two-Degree-of-Freedom (2-DoF) control framework. We discuss some basic\\nproperties of the mapping, including the existence, uniqueness and\\ninvertibility. Taking as an example the PID control applied to a general\\nuncertain second-order plant, we prove by the singular perturbation theory that\\nthe closed-loop steady-state and transient performance depends explicitly on\\none auxiliary parameter which can be viewed as the virtual singular\\nperturbation parameter (SPP) of PID control. All the three PID gains are\\nmonotonically decreasing functions of the SPP, indicating that the smaller the\\nSPP is, the higher the PID gains are, and the better the robustness of PID\\ncontrol is. Simulation and experimental examples are provided to demonstrate\\nthe properties of the mapping as well as the effectiveness of the mapping based\\nPID gain turning.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T13:11:06Z\"}"}
