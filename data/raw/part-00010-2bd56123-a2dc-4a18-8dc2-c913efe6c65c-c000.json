{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21285v1\", \"title\": \"Induced Diffusion of Internal Gravity Waves: Directionality and Role in\\n  Ocean Mixing\", \"summary\": \"Induced diffusion (ID), an important mechanism of spectral energy transfer in\\nthe internal gravity wave (IGW) field, plays a significant role in driving\\nturbulent dissipation in the ocean interior. In this study, we revisit the ID\\nmechanism to elucidate its directionality and role in ocean mixing under\\nvarying IGW spectral forms, with particular attention to deviations from the\\nstandard Garrett-Munk (GM) spectrum. The original interpretation of ID as an\\naction diffusion process, as proposed by McComas et al., suggests that ID is\\ninherently bidirectional, with its direction governed by the\\nvertical-wavenumber spectral slope $\\\\sigma$ of the IGW action spectrum, $n\\n\\\\propto m^\\\\sigma$. In contrast, by evaluating the wave kinetic equation, we\\nreveal a more complete depiction of ID, comprising both diffusive and\\nscale-separated transfers that are rooted in energy conservation within wave\\ntriads. Although the action diffusion may reverse direction depending on the\\nsign of $\\\\sigma$ (i.e., between red and blue spectral cases), the combined ID\\ntransfer consistently leads to a forward energy cascade at the dissipation\\nscale, thereby contributing positively to turbulent dissipation. This supports\\nthe viewpoint of ID as a dissipative mechanism in physical oceanography. This\\nstudy presents a physically grounded overview of ID and offers insights into\\nthe specific types of wave-wave interactions responsible for turbulent\\ndissipation.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ao-ph,physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T03:34:02Z\"}"}
