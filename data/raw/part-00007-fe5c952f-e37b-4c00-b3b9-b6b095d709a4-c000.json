{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16413v1\", \"title\": \"Hierarchical Distributed Architecture for the Least Allan Variance\\n  Atomic Timing\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we propose a hierarchical distributed timing architecture\\nbased on an ensemble of miniature atomic clocks. The goal is to ensure\\nsynchronized and accurate timing in a normal operating mode where Global\\nNavigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are available, as well as in an\\nemergency operating mode during GNSS failures. At the lower level, the\\nminiature atomic clocks employ a distributed control strategy that uses only\\nlocal information to ensure synchronization in both modes. The resulting\\nsynchronized time or generated time scale has the best frequency stability, as\\nmeasured by the Allan variance, over the short control period. In the upper\\nlayer, a supervisor controls the long-term behavior of the generated time\\nscale. In the normal operating mode, the supervisor periodically anchors the\\ngenerated time scale to the standard time based on GNSS signals, while in the\\nemergency operating mode, it applies optimal floating control to reduce the\\ndivergence rate of the generated time scale, which is not observable from the\\nmeasurable time difference between the miniature atomic clocks. This floating\\ncontrol aims to explicitly control the generated time scale to have the least\\nAllan variance over the long control period. Finally, numerical examples are\\nprovided to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the architecture\\nin high-precision, GNSS-resilient atomic timing.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T04:35:33Z\"}"}
