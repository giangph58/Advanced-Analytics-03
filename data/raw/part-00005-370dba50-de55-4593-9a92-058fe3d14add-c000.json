We work in the superconformal\\nformalism and show that flat space is the only fully supersymmetric solution in\\nthese theories. However, in N=2 Poincare supergravity, three fully\\nsupersymmetric solutions exist: Bertotti-Robinson geometry ($AdS_2\\\\times S^2$),\\nflat space and pp wave spacetimes, which are known in the literature. We\\ndiscuss the reason behind the richer vacua in N=2 supergravity compared to its\\nN=3 and N=4 cousins.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T16:27:13Z\"}"}
