{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07821v1\", \"title\": \"Signatures of NED on Quasi periodic Oscillations of a Magnetically\\n  Charged Black Hole\", \"summary\": \"In this work, we explore the influence of nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) on\\nthe quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) of a magnetic charged black hole by\\nanalyzing the motion of test particles and their epicyclic frequencies.\\nStarting from the effective potential, angular momentum, and energy of circular\\norbits, we examine how the NED parameter b alters the orbital dynamics. We find\\nthat as b increases, the system transitions smoothly from the RN regime towards\\nthe Schwarzschild profile, with observable changes in the innermost stable\\ncircular orbit (ISCO) and Keplerian frequencies. We further investigate the\\nvariation in the radii of QPOs with respect to the NED parameter b by employing\\nthe RP, WD, and ER models. We also perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\\nanalysis using observational QPO data from a diverse set of black hole sources\\nspanning stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive regimes. The MCMC\\nresults yield consistent constraints on the parameter b across all mass\\nregimes, indicating that NED effects leave a distinguishable signature on the\\nQPO structure of a charged black hole.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:58:18Z\"}"}
