Our approach follows a data-centric paradigm,\\nconstructing a high-quality data synthesis pipeline based on Deepseek-R1 to\\ncurate LeX-10K, a dataset of 10K high-resolution, aesthetically refined\\n1024$\\\\times$1024 images. Beyond dataset construction, we develop LeX-Enhancer,\\na robust prompt enrichment model, and train two text-to-image models, LeX-FLUX\\nand LeX-Lumina, achieving state-of-the-art text rendering performance. To\\nsystematically evaluate visual text generation, we introduce LeX-Bench, a\\nbenchmark that assesses fidelity, aesthetics, and alignment, complemented by\\nPairwise Normalized Edit Distance (PNED), a novel metric for robust text\\naccuracy evaluation. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements, with\\nLeX-Lumina achieving a 79.81% PNED gain on CreateBench, and LeX-FLUX\\noutperforming baselines in color (+3.18%), positional (+4.45%), and font\\naccuracy (+3.81%). Our codes, models, datasets, and demo are publicly\\navailable.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:56:15Z\"}"}
