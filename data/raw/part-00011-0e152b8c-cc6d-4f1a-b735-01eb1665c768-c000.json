Interfacial free energies\", \"summary\": \"This study proposes a new method for predicting the crystal-melt interfacial\\nfree energy ($\\\\gamma$) using the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) model, enhanced by\\natomistic simulation data for more accurate density wave profiles. The analysis\\nfocuses on the soft-sphere system governed by an inverse power potential that\\nstabilizes both BCC and FCC phases. Equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD)\\nsimulations are used to obtain density wave amplitude distributions, which\\nserve as inputs for the GL model to predict $\\\\gamma$ and its anisotropy. The\\npredicted $\\\\gamma$ values exhibit strong agreement with prior benchmark\\nsimulation experimental studies, particularly for FCC crystal-melt interfaces\\n(CMIs). The GL models for the CMI $\\\\gamma$ are proved to be both\\ncomputationally efficient and reasonably valid, offering quantitative\\npredictions of $\\\\gamma$ while providing insights into the factors controlling\\nits magnitude and anisotropy. Key improvement is suggested for the variational\\nprocedure used in the two-mode CMI free energy functionals, and potential\\nupgrades to the GL model are also proposed to further enhance predictive\\naccuracy.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T14:40:02Z\"}"}
