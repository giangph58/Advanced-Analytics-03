{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21824v1\", \"title\": \"A simple range characterization for spherical mean transform in even\\n  dimensions\", \"summary\": \"The paper presents a new and simple range characterization for the spherical\\nmean transform of functions supported in the unit ball in even dimensions. It\\ncomplements the previous work of the same authors, where they solved an\\nanalogous problem in odd dimensions. The range description in even dimensions\\nconsists of symmetry relations, using a special kind of elliptic integrals\\ninvolving the coefficients of the spherical harmonics expansion of the function\\nin the range of the transform. The article also introduces a pair of original\\nidentities involving normalized Bessel functions of the first and the second\\nkind. The first result is an integral cross-product identity for Bessel\\nfunctions of integer order, complementing a similar relation for Bessel\\nfunctions of half-integer order obtained in the aforementioned work of the same\\nauthors. The second result is a new Nicholson-type identity. Both of these\\nrelations can be considered as important standalone results in the theory of\\nspecial functions. Finally, as part of the proof of one of the theorems, the\\nauthors derive an interesting equality involving elliptic integrals, which may\\nbe of independent interest.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CA\", \"categories\": \"math.CA,math-ph,math.FA,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:27:23Z\"}"}
