While the water cloud model (WCM) provides a semi-physical\\napproach for understanding these interactions, its empirical component often\\nlimits performance across diverse agricultural landscapes. This research\\npresents preliminary efforts for developing a knowledge-guided deep learning\\napproach, which integrates WCM principles into a long short-term memory (LSTM)\\nmodel, to estimate field SM using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)\\ndata. Our proposed approach leverages LSTM's capacity to capture spatiotemporal\\ndependencies while maintaining physical consistency through a modified\\ndual-component loss function, including a WCM-based semi-physical component and\\na boundary condition regularisation. The proposed approach is built upon the\\nsoil backscatter coefficients isolated from the total backscatter, together\\nwith Landsat-resolution vegetation information and surface characteristics. A\\nfour-fold spatial cross-validation was performed against in-situ SM data to\\nassess the model performance. Results showed the proposed approach reduced SM\\nretrieval uncertainties by 0.02 m$^3$/m$^3$ and achieved correlation\\ncoefficients (R) of up to 0.64 in areas with varying vegetation cover and\\nsurface conditions, demonstrating the potential to address the\\nover-simplification in WCM.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,eess.IV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T03:12:25Z\"}"}
