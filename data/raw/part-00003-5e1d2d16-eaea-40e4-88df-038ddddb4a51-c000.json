Physically this corresponds to the\\nsimultaneous tunneling of multiple degrees of freedom. A system with four equal\\nminima is examined in detail. It has three instanton types or flavors with\\ndistinct actions. For weak coupling and subject to there being a single large\\n(or small) parameter, the interactive system can be handled perturbatively. The\\nzero mode problem arising from time translation symmetry is handled via the\\nFadeev-Popov procedure. A diagrammatic procedure allows corrections to the\\nfluctuation determinant to be calculated systematically. Independent instanton\\ncontributions are summed over by extending the dilute gas approximation to\\nthree flavors and energy splittings of the lowest four states is calculated.\\nAll tunneling amplitudes are concisely expressed in terms of elementary\\nfunctions. While the model is possibly useful for a variety of physical\\nsystems, an application is made here to the tunneling of a composite particle\\nin one dimension.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.other,math-ph,math.MP,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T05:55:22Z\"}"}
