Instead, the weights appear close to\\nGaussian distributed random matrices. Although significantly more work is\\nneeded to support a robust assessment in this direction, these results suggest\\nthat deep-learning and the numerical solution of the Boltzmann equation\\nrepresent two equivalent, but largely distinct paths to the same physical\\nknowledge. If so, Explainable AI might be an unrealistic target and possibly\\neven an ill-posed one.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.comp-ph,cs.LG,physics.data-an\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T19:57:36Z\"}"}
