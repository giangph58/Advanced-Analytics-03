{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06910v1\", \"title\": \"Identifying Aspects in Peer Reviews\", \"summary\": \"Peer review is central to academic publishing, but the growing volume of\\nsubmissions is straining the process. This motivates the development of\\ncomputational approaches to support peer review. While each review is tailored\\nto a specific paper, reviewers often make assessments according to certain\\naspects such as Novelty, which reflect the values of the research community.\\nThis alignment creates opportunities for standardizing the reviewing process,\\nimproving quality control, and enabling computational support. While prior work\\nhas demonstrated the potential of aspect analysis for peer review assistance,\\nthe notion of aspect remains poorly formalized. Existing approaches often\\nderive aspect sets from review forms and guidelines of major NLP venues, yet\\ndata-driven methods for aspect identification are largely underexplored. To\\naddress this gap, our work takes a bottom-up approach: we propose an\\noperational definition of aspect and develop a data-driven schema for deriving\\nfine-grained aspects from a corpus of peer reviews. We introduce a dataset of\\npeer reviews augmented with aspects and show how it can be used for\\ncommunity-level review analysis. We further show how the choice of aspects can\\nimpact downstream applications, such as LLM-generated review detection. Our\\nresults lay a foundation for a principled and data-driven investigation of\\nreview aspects, and pave the path for new applications of NLP to support peer\\nreview.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:14:42Z\"}"}
