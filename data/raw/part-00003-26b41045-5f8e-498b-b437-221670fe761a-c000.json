We impose three axioms for such solution concepts. The\\naxiom of backward induction requires each solution to contain a quasi-perfect\\nequilibrium. Two invariance axioms posit that solutions of a game are the same\\nas those of a game obtained by the addition of strategically irrelevant\\nstrategies and players. Stability satisfies these axioms; and any solution\\nconcept that satisfies them must, for generic extensive-form games, select from\\namong its stable outcomes. A strengthening of the two invariance axioms\\nprovides an analogous axiomatization of components of equilibria with a nonzero\\nindex.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.TH\", \"categories\": \"econ.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T17:35:47Z\"}"}
