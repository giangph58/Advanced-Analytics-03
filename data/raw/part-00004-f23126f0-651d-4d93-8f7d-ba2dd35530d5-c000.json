We separately\\nexamine the effects of Landau fluctuations and electronic noise. To analyze\\nLandau fluctuations, we relate the time resolution of a single electron-hole\\npair generated at a random position in the sensor to the time resolution\\nassociated with the full ionization pattern produced by a charged particle. For\\nelectronic noise, we explore optimal filtering techniques that minimize its\\nimpact on time resolution, and evaluate how closely these can be approximated\\nby practical filters. Finally, we demonstrate that the combined effect of\\nLandau fluctuations and electronic noise cannot, in general, be simply\\nexpressed as the quadratic sum of the individual contributions.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex,physics.ins-det\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T13:36:06Z\"}"}
