However,\\ngeometry-preserving numerical methods for simulating Riemannian SDEs remain\\nrelatively underdeveloped. In this paper, we propose the Exponential\\nEuler-Maruyama (Exp-EM) scheme for approximating solutions of SDEs on\\nRiemannian manifolds. The Exp-EM scheme is both geometry-preserving and\\ncomputationally tractable. We establish a strong convergence rate of\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\delta^{\\\\frac{1 - \\\\epsilon}{2}})$ for the Exp-EM scheme, which\\nextends previous results obtained for specific manifolds to a more general\\nsetting. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate our theoretical\\nfindings.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T04:14:00Z\"}"}
