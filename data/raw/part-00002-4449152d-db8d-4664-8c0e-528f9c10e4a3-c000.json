We identify a sample of 24 [O III]\\nemission line galaxies in the field, which forms a large overdensity in the\\nprotocluster region. The protocluster is expected to evolve into a Virgo-like\\ncluster by z=0. Utilizing multiwavelength data, we derive the physical\\nproperties of these [O III] emitters and find they are medium mass normal\\nstar-forming galaxies ($\\\\sim10^{10}$M$_\\\\odot$) roughly following the\\nstar-forming main sequence. The [O III] emitters trace an overdensity spatially\\noffset from that of photometric-redshift and quiescent galaxies, suggesting\\nthese distinct galaxy populations may inhabit dark matter halos that formed at\\ndifferent epochs. A comparative analysis of [O III] emitter properties shows\\nsimilar characteristics in both protocluster and field environments. This\\nprotocluster likely represents an evolved structure that has progressed beyond\\nits peak star-formation phase, although our limited sample size may prevent\\ndetection of subtle environmental effects.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T16:18:48Z\"}"}
