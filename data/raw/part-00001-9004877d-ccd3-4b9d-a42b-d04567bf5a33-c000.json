On the other\\nhand, if the Brownian particle begins its motion at the North pole, then this\\nparticle will leave quickly, when the dimension of the sphere goes to infinity,\\nany geodesic ball with radius $\\\\delta <\\\\pi/2$, centered at this point. Namely,\\nthe mean exit time function defined on the equatorial tubes presents a kind of\\n{\\\\em concentration} phenomenon or {\\\\em fat equator} effect, as it has been\\ndescribed in the book \\\\cite{MS}.\\n  Moreover, the same concentration phenomenon occurs when we consider this mean\\nexit time function defined on tubes around closed and minimal hypersurfaces of\\na compact Riemannian $n$-manifold $M$ with Ricci curvature bounded from below,\\n${\\\\rm Ric}_{M}\\\\geq (n-1)$. Namely, a Brownian particle that begins its random\\nmovement around a closed embedded minimal hypersurface of a compact\\n$n$-manifold $M$ with ${\\\\rm Ric}_{M}\\\\geq (n-1)$ will wanders arbitrarily close\\nto the hypersurface for a time that approaches infinity as the dimension of the\\nambient manifold does so as well.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T12:58:58Z\"}"}
