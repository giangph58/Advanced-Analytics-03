{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04762v1\", \"title\": \"Extension of Yager's negation of probability distribution based on\\n  uncertainty measures\", \"summary\": \"Existing research on negations primarily focuses on entropy and extropy.\\nRecently, new functions such as varentropy and varextropy have been developed,\\nwhich can be considered as\\n  extensions of entropy and extropy. However, the impact of negation on these\\nextended measures, particularly varentropy and varextropy, has not been\\nextensively explored. To address\\n  this gap, this paper investigates the effect of negation on Shannon entropy,\\nvarentropy, and varextropy. We explore how the negation of a probability\\ndistribution influences these\\n  measures, showing that the negated distribution consistently leads to higher\\nvalues of Shannon entropy, varentropy, and varextropy compared to the original\\ndistribution.\\n  Additionally, we prove that the negation of a probability distribution\\nmaximizes these measures during the process. The paper provides theoretical\\nproofs and a detailed analysis of\\n  the behaviour of these measures, contributing to a better understanding of\\nthe interplay between probability distributions, negation, and\\ninformation-theoretic quantities.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T06:23:51Z\"}"}
