{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21282v1\", \"title\": \"Birdie: Natural Language-Driven Table Discovery Using Differentiable\\n  Search Index\", \"summary\": \"Natural language (NL)-driven table discovery identifies relevant tables from\\nlarge table repositories based on NL queries. While current deep-learning-based\\nmethods using the traditional dense vector search pipeline, i.e.,\\nrepresentation-index-search, achieve remarkable accuracy, they face several\\nlimitations that impede further performance improvements: (i) the errors\\naccumulated during the table representation and indexing phases affect the\\nsubsequent search accuracy; and (ii) insufficient query-table interaction\\nhinders effective semantic alignment, impeding accuracy improvements. In this\\npaper, we propose a novel framework Birdie, using a differentiable search\\nindex. It unifies the indexing and search into a single encoder-decoder\\nlanguage model, thus getting rid of error accumulations. Birdie first assigns\\neach table a prefix-aware identifier and leverages a large language model-based\\nquery generator to create synthetic queries for each table. It then encodes the\\nmapping between synthetic queries/tables and their corresponding table\\nidentifiers into the parameters of an encoder-decoder language model, enabling\\ndeep query-table interactions. During search, the trained model directly\\ngenerates table identifiers for a given query. To accommodate the continual\\nindexing of dynamic tables, we introduce an index update strategy via parameter\\nisolation, which mitigates the issue of catastrophic forgetting. Extensive\\nexperiments demonstrate that Birdie outperforms state-of-the-art dense methods\\nby 16.8% in accuracy, and reduces forgetting by over 90% compared to other\\ncontinual learning approaches.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DB\", \"categories\": \"cs.DB\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T03:30:21Z\"}"}
