The question is that whether the\\nremainder $$\\nR_n=\\\\sum_{j=1}^{2^n}\\\\left(\\\\xi_{j,n}-\\\\frac{j}{2^n}\\\\right)^2-2^n\\\\int_0^1(?(x)-x))^2\\\\text{d}x\\n$$ tends to $0$ when $n$ tends to infinity, where $\\\\xi_{j,n}$ are elements of\\nthe Stern-Brocot sequence and $?(x)$ denotes Minkowski Question-Mark Function.\\nWe present some extended results and give a correct proof of a theorem on the\\nFourier-Stieltjes coefficient of the inverse function of $?(x)$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T05:03:35Z\"}"}
