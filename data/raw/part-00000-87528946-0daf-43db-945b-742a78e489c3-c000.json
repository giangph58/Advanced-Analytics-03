However, existing public datasets are often limited in scale, geographic\\ncoverage, or sensor variety. We introduce TerraMesh, a new globally diverse,\\nmultimodal dataset combining optical, synthetic aperture radar, elevation, and\\nland-cover modalities in an Analysis-Ready Data format. TerraMesh includes over\\n9 million samples with eight spatiotemporal aligned modalities, enabling\\nlarge-scale pre-training and fostering robust cross-modal correlation learning.\\nWe provide detailed data processing steps, comprehensive statistics, and\\nempirical evidence demonstrating improved model performance when pre-trained on\\nTerraMesh. The dataset will be made publicly available with a permissive\\nlicense.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T13:20:35Z\"}"}
