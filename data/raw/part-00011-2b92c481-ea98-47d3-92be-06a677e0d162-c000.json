{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16902v1\", \"title\": \"Building A Secure Agentic AI Application Leveraging A2A Protocol\", \"summary\": \"As Agentic AI systems evolve from basic workflows to complex multi agent\\ncollaboration, robust protocols such as Google's Agent2Agent (A2A) become\\nessential enablers. To foster secure adoption and ensure the reliability of\\nthese complex interactions, understanding the secure implementation of A2A is\\nessential. This paper addresses this goal by providing a comprehensive security\\nanalysis centered on the A2A protocol. We examine its fundamental elements and\\noperational dynamics, situating it within the framework of agent communication\\ndevelopment. Utilizing the MAESTRO framework, specifically designed for AI\\nrisks, we apply proactive threat modeling to assess potential security issues\\nin A2A deployments, focusing on aspects such as Agent Card management, task\\nexecution integrity, and authentication methodologies.\\n  Based on these insights, we recommend practical secure development\\nmethodologies and architectural best practices designed to build resilient and\\neffective A2A systems. Our analysis also explores how the synergy between A2A\\nand the Model Context Protocol (MCP) can further enhance secure\\ninteroperability. This paper equips developers and architects with the\\nknowledge and practical guidance needed to confidently leverage the A2A\\nprotocol for building robust and secure next generation agentic applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T17:27:49Z\"}"}
