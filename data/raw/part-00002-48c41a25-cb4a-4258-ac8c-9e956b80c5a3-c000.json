Their population dynamics involve growth and decay processes,\\nthe former owing to the balance between biological proliferation and mortality,\\nwhile the latter results from mechanical abrasion because of the transport of\\nsediment particles, such as sand and gravel. The decay has experimentally been\\nidentified to exhibit long memory behavior, where the population decreases at\\nan algebraic rate. However, the origin and mathematical theory of this\\nphenomenon remain unresolved. This study introduces a novel mathematical model\\nemploying spin processes to describe microscopic biofilm dynamics. The\\ncontinuum limit of these spin processes captures the long-memory decay and\\ngenerates generic growth curves. A spin process is defined as a continuous-time\\nstochastic process transitioning between states 0 and 1. The proposed framework\\nleverages heterogeneous spin rates, achieved by superposing spin processes with\\ndistinct rates, to reproduce the long-memory decay. Computational simulations\\ndemonstrate the behavior of the model, particularly emphasizing rate-induced\\ntipping phenomena. This mathematical model provides a computationally tractable\\ninterpretation of benthic algae dynamics, relevant to applications in\\nmathematical modelling.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T09:48:22Z\"}"}
