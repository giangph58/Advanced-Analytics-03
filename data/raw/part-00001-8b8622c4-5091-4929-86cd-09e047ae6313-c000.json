We\\nsolve this equation exactly by employing a train of Dirac-delta switchings.\\nThis method also enables us to visualize the memory effect in the environment.\\nFurthermore, we compute the two-time correlation functions of the system's\\nquadratures and show that the discrete-time Fourier transform is well-suited\\nfor defining spectral densities, as the Dirac-delta switchings turn continuous\\nfunctions into discretized samples.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T08:22:46Z\"}"}
