While deep convolutional neural networks have\\ndemonstrated state-of-the-art performance in spatial-temporal super-resolution\\ntasks, their computationally intensive nature poses significant deployment\\nchallenges for resource-constrained edge devices, particularly in real-time\\nmobile video processing scenarios where power efficiency and latency\\nconstraints coexist. In this work, we propose a Reparameterizable Architecture\\nfor High Fidelity Video Super Resolution method, named RepNet-VSR, for\\nreal-time 4x video super-resolution. On the REDS validation set, the proposed\\nmodel achieves 27.79 dB PSNR when processing 180p to 720p frames in 103 ms per\\n10 frames on a MediaTek Dimensity NPU. The competition results demonstrate an\\nexcellent balance between restoration quality and deployment efficiency. The\\nproposed method scores higher than the previous champion algorithm of MAI video\\nsuper-resolution challenge.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T07:15:07Z\"}"}
