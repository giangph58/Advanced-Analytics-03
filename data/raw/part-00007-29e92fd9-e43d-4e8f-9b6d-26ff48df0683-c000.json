We find that, the\\nHawkes process in our context admits a similar equation to that in\\n\\\\cite{MR3563196} for {\\\\it subcritical} case. In particular, the rescaled Hawkes\\nprocess $(Z^n_{nt}/n^{2\\\\alpha})_{t\\\\in[0,1]}$ converges in law to a kind of\\nintegrated fractional Cox Ingersoll Ross process with different coefficients\\nfrom that in \\\\cite{MR3563196}, as $n$ tends to infinity.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T14:08:53Z\"}"}
