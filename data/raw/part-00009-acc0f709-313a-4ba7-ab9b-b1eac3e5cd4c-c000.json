This system has been recently introduced to provide a\\nprototype model of how a black hole processes and stores information. We\\nperform a numerical finite-size analysis of this isolated quantum system and\\nfind indications that its information-carrying subsystem approaches thermality\\nin the large system-size limit. The results lead us to suggest a novel\\nthermalization mechanism. The corresponding distinguishing characteristic is\\nthat for a large class of physically meaningful non-equilibrium initial states\\n$| \\\\text{in} \\\\rangle$, a few-body observable $\\\\hat{A}$ thermalizes despite\\nunignorable correlations between the fluctuations of its eigenstate expectation\\nvalues $\\\\langle \\\\alpha | \\\\hat{A} | \\\\alpha \\\\rangle$ in the eigenstate basis of\\nthe model $\\\\left\\\\{ | \\\\alpha \\\\rangle \\\\right\\\\}$ and the fluctuations of the\\nsquared magnitudes of the coefficients $|C_{\\\\alpha}|^2 = |\\\\langle \\\\alpha |\\n\\\\text{in} \\\\rangle |^2$.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T09:58:20Z\"}"}
