{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00283v1\", \"title\": \"High Dimensional Ensemble Kalman Filter\", \"summary\": \"The ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), as a fundamental data assimilation\\napproach, has been widely used in many fields of earth science, engineering and\\nbeyond. However, there are several unknown theoretical aspects of the EnKF,\\nespecially when the state variable is of high dimensional accompanied with high\\nresolution observation and physical models. This paper first proposes several\\nhigh dimensional EnKF methods which provide consistent estimators for the\\nimportant forecast error covariance and the Kalman gain matrix. It then studies\\nthe theoretical properties of the EnKF under both the fixed and high\\ndimensional state variables, which provides the mean square errors of the\\nanalysis states to the underlying oracle states offered by the Kalman filter\\nand gives the much needed insight into the roles played by forecast error\\ncovariance on the accuracy of the EnKF. The accuracy of the data assimilation\\nunder the misspecified physical model is also considered. Numerical studies on\\nthe Lorenz-96 and the Shallow Water Equation models illustrate that the\\nproposed high dimensional EnKF algorithms perform better than the standard EnKF\\nmethods as they provide more robust and accurate assimilated results. The high\\ndimensional EnKF is applied to assimilate sea temperature in Northwest Pacific,\\nwhich showed more accurate out-sample performance than the existing methods.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T04:12:10Z\"}"}
