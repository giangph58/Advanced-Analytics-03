Concisely, it stands for the conditional\\nexpected volatility when sudden market behaviors of the underlying occur. One\\nis able to explore risk management usages by following the orthotical\\nDelta-Gamma dynamic hedging framework. The realized local volatility surface\\nis, mathematically, a generalized Wiener measure from historical prices. It is\\nreconstructed via employing high-frequency trading market data. A\\nStick-Breaking Gaussian Mixture Model is fitted via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo,\\nproducing a local volatility surface with 95% credible intervals. A practically\\nvalidated Bayesian nonparametric estimation workflow. Empirical results on TSLA\\nhigh-frequency data illustrate its ability to capture counterfactual\\nvolatility. We also discuss its application in improving volatility-based risk\\nmanagement.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.RM\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.RM,math.OC,q-fin.CP,q-fin.TR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T06:35:34Z\"}"}
