{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21536v1\", \"title\": \"Scientific Workflow Scheduling in Cloud Considering Cold Start and\\n  Variable Pricing Model\", \"summary\": \"Cloud computing has become a pivotal platform for executing scientific\\nworkflows due to its scalable and cost-effective infrastructure. Scientific\\nCloud Service Providers (SCSPs) act as intermediaries that rent virtual\\nmachines (VMs) from Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) providers to meet users'\\nworkflow execution demands. The SCSP earns profit from the execution of\\nscientific workflows if it completes the execution of the workflow before the\\nspecified deadline of the workflow. This paper addresses two key challenges\\nthat impact the profitability of SCSPs: the cold start problem and the\\nefficient management of diverse VM pricing models, namely reserved, on-demand,\\nand spot instances.\\n  We propose a hybrid scheduling framework that integrates initial planning\\nbased on historical data with real-time adaptations informed by actual workload\\nvariations. In the initial phase, VMs are provisioned using reserved pricing\\nbased on predicted workloads and spot instances. During execution, the system\\ndynamically adjusts by provisioning additional VMs through on-demand or spot\\ninstances to accommodate unexpected bursts in task arrivals. Our framework also\\nincorporates a dependency-aware task scheduling strategy that accounts for cold\\nstart delays and spot pricing volatility. Experimental results on real-world\\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art\\nmethods, achieving up to 20% improvement over cold-start-focused techniques and\\n15% over pricing-model-based VM provisioning strategies.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T11:32:55Z\"}"}
