We show that every\\nspecification that is invariant to time shifts admits a stochastic invariant\\nthat bounds its probability from below; for systems with general state space,\\nthe stochastic invariant bounds this probability as closely as desired; for\\nsystems with finite state space, it quantifies it exactly. Our result enables\\nthe extension of every certificate for the almost-sure satisfaction of\\nshift-invariant specifications to its quantitative counterpart, ensuring\\ncompleteness up to an approximation in the general case and exactness in the\\nfinite-state case. This generalises and unifies existing supermartingale\\ncertificates for quantitative verification and control under reachability,\\nsafety, reach-avoidance, and stability specifications, as well as asymptotic\\nbounds on accrued costs and rewards. Furthermore, our result provides the first\\nsupermartingale certificate for computing upper and lower bounds on the\\nprobability of satisfying $\\\\omega$-regular and linear temporal logic\\nspecifications. We present an algorithm for quantitative $\\\\omega$-regular\\nverification and control synthesis based on our method and demonstrate its\\npractical efficacy on several infinite-state examples.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LO\", \"categories\": \"cs.LO,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:34:40Z\"}"}
