Our goal is to estimate $W = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\nw(i)$ within a $(1 \\\\pm \\\\epsilon)$ factor using a sublinear number of samples,\\nassuming weights are non-increasing, i.e., $w(1) \\\\geq w(2) \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq\\nw(n)$. The sum estimation problem is well-studied under different access models\\nto the universe $U$. However, to the best of our knowledge, nothing is known\\nabout the sum estimation problem using non-adaptive conditional sampling. In\\nthis work, we explore the sum estimation problem using non-adaptive conditional\\nweighted and non-adaptive conditional uniform samples, assuming that the\\nunderlying distribution ($D(i)=w(i)/W$) is monotone. We also extend our\\napproach to to the case where the underlying distribution of $U$ is unimodal.\\nAdditionally, we consider support size estimation when $w(i) = 0$ or $w(i) \\\\geq\\nW/n$, using hybrid sampling (both weighted and uniform) to access $U$. We\\npropose an algorithm to estimate $W$ under the non-increasing weight\\nassumption, using $O(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon^3} \\\\log{n} + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon^6})$\\nnon-adaptive weighted conditional samples and $O(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon^3} \\\\log{n})$\\nuniform conditional samples. Our algorithm matches the $\\\\Omega(\\\\log{n})$ lower\\nbound by \\\\cite{ACK15}. For unimodal distributions, the sample complexity\\nremains similar, with an additional $O(\\\\log{n})$ evaluation queries to locate\\nthe minimum weighted point in the domain. For estimating the support size $k$\\nof $U$, where weights are either $0$ or at least $W/n$, our algorithm uses\\n$O\\\\big( \\\\frac{\\\\log^3(n/\\\\epsilon)}{\\\\epsilon^8} \\\\cdot \\\\log^4\\n\\\\frac{\\\\log(n/\\\\epsilon)}{\\\\epsilon} \\\\big)$ uniform samples and $O\\\\big(\\n\\\\frac{\\\\log(n/\\\\epsilon)}{\\\\epsilon^2} \\\\cdot \\\\log\\n\\\\frac{\\\\log(n/\\\\epsilon)}{\\\\epsilon} \\\\big)$ weighted samples to output $\\\\hat{k}$\\nsatisfying $k - 2\\\\epsilon n \\\\leq \\\\hat{k} \\\\leq k + \\\\epsilon n$.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T14:56:29Z\"}"}
