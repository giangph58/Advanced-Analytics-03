{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14955v1\", \"title\": \"Efficient Document Retrieval with G-Retriever\", \"summary\": \"Textual data question answering has gained significant attention due to its\\ngrowing applicability. Recently, a novel approach leveraging the\\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) method was introduced, utilizing the\\nPrize-Collecting Steiner Tree (PCST) optimization for sub-graph construction.\\nHowever, this method focused solely on node attributes, leading to incomplete\\ncontextual understanding. In this paper, we propose an enhanced approach that\\nreplaces the PCST method with an attention-based sub-graph construction\\ntechnique, enabling more efficient and context-aware retrieval. Additionally,\\nwe encode both node and edge attributes, leading to richer graph\\nrepresentations. Our method also incorporates an improved projection layer and\\nmulti-head attention pooling for better alignment with Large Language Models\\n(LLMs). Experimental evaluations on the WebQSP dataset demonstrate that our\\napproach is competitive and achieves marginally better results compared to the\\noriginal method, underscoring its potential for more accurate question\\nanswering.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T08:27:26Z\"}"}
