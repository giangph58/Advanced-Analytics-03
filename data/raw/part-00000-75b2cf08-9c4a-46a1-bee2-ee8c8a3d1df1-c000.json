Here, the quantum\\ninterference signal is obtained by scanning the magnetic field rather than\\nconventional method of changing the frequency separation between the light\\nfields. We could simultaneously observe resonances due to population\\nredistribution and quantum superposition between non-degenerate states, which\\notherwise involves fundamentally different approaches. The method is\\nimplemented to Rubidium atoms in buffer gas filled as well as anti-relaxation\\ncoated atomic cells. Apart from phenomenological interest, the modified\\nexperimental procedure is found to be convenient for in-situ calibration of\\nthree axis magnetic coils. The investigation will be useful for high as well as\\nlow vector magnetic field sensing.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T12:00:09Z\"}"}
