The pressure waves in such methods travel at finite speeds,\\nand hence they yield non-solenoidal velocity fields. This inherent inability to\\nsatisfy mass conservation corresponding to incompressible flows is a crucial\\nconcern for weakly compressible methods. Another widely reported observation is\\nthe progressive enhancement of non-physical dissipation with the increase in\\nthe artificial compressibility parameter. By scrutinizing the dilatation terms\\nappearing in the kinetic energy equation, we provide vital insights into the\\ninfluence of mass conservation error on the accuracy of these methods, and\\nexplain the mechanism behind the dissipative nature of the compressibility.\\nAnalysing transient laminar and turbulent flows, we show that the\\ndilatation-driven dissipation terms, not the mass conservation error alone,\\ngovern the accuracy of weakly compressible methods. The insights provided in\\nthis work are not only of fundamental importance but will be of considerable\\nvalue in aiding the development of weakly compressible methods that can allow a\\nlarger artificial Mach number, thus alleviating the stringent time step\\nrestriction in such methods.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.comp-ph,physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T14:02:20Z\"}"}
