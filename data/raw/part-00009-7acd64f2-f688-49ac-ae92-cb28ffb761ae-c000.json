{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14948v1\", \"title\": \"Mechanism Design for Auctions with Externalities on Budgets\", \"summary\": \"This paper studies mechanism design for auctions with externalities on\\nbudgets, a novel setting where the budgets that bidders commit are adjusted due\\nto the externality of the competitors' allocation outcomes-a departure from\\ntraditional auctions with fixed budgets. This setting is motivated by\\nreal-world scenarios, for example, participants may increase their budgets in\\nresponse to competitors' obtained items. We initially propose a general\\nframework with homogeneous externalities to capture the interdependence between\\nbudget updates and allocation, formalized through a budget response function\\nthat links each bidder's effective budget to the amount of items won by others.\\n  The main contribution of this paper is to propose a truthful and individual\\nrational auction mechanism for this novel auction setting, which achieves an\\napproximation ratio of $1/3$ with respect to the liquid welfare. This mechanism\\nis inspired by the uniform-price auction, in which an appropriate uniform price\\nis selected to allocate items, ensuring the monotonicity of the allocation rule\\nwhile accounting for budget adjustments. Additionally, this mechanism\\nguarantees a constant approximation ratio by setting a purchase limit.\\nComplementing this result, we establish an upper bound: no truthful mechanism\\ncan achieve an approximation ratio better than $1/2$. This work offers a new\\nperspective to study the impact of externalities on auctions, providing an\\napproach to handle budget externalities in multi-agent systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GT\", \"categories\": \"cs.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T08:11:21Z\"}"}
