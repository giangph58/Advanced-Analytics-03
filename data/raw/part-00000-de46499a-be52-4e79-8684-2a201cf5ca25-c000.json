{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16479v1\", \"title\": \"The Dance of Atoms-De Novo Protein Design with Diffusion Model\", \"summary\": \"The de novo design of proteins refers to creating proteins with specific\\nstructures and functions that do not naturally exist. In recent years, the\\naccumulation of high-quality protein structure and sequence data and\\ntechnological advancements have paved the way for the successful application of\\ngenerative artificial intelligence (AI) models in protein design. These models\\nhave surpassed traditional approaches that rely on fragments and\\nbioinformatics. They have significantly enhanced the success rate of de novo\\nprotein design, and reduced experimental costs, leading to breakthroughs in the\\nfield. Among various generative AI models, diffusion models have yielded the\\nmost promising results in protein design. In the past two to three years, more\\nthan ten protein design models based on diffusion models have emerged. Among\\nthem, the representative model, RFDiffusion, has demonstrated success rates in\\n25 protein design tasks that far exceed those of traditional methods, and other\\nAI-based approaches like RFjoint and hallucination. This review will\\nsystematically examine the application of diffusion models in generating\\nprotein backbones and sequences. We will explore the strengths and limitations\\nof different models, summarize successful cases of protein design using\\ndiffusion models, and discuss future development directions.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.BM\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.BM,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T07:45:00Z\"}"}
