We predict the AC Josephson effect is activated when\\nthis current surpasses the junction's critical current. Our investigation of\\nthis phenomenon employs the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory framework in\\nproximity to the critical temperature. Our results indicate that the frequency\\nof the AC current is approximately given by ${\\\\pi} S {\\\\Delta} T / (2\\n{\\\\Phi}_0)$, where $S$ represents the Seebeck coefficient and ${\\\\Phi}_0$ the\\nmagnetic flux quantum and we estimate the frequency be on the range of GHz for\\nSn up to a THz for larger $S$ and $T_c$ materials. Furthermore, we propose two\\ndistinct experimental configurations to observe this effect.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T16:41:34Z\"}"}
