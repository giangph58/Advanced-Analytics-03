It also addresses key fabrication challenges, such as robustness,\\nbonding strength, and scalability. In this study, we investigate strain effects\\nin DOI substrates following direct bonding. Strain generation is expected near\\nthe diamond-SiO2/Si interface due to thermal expansion coefficient mismatch\\nbetween the bonded materials. Strain-induced lattice distortions are\\ncharacterized using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond via optically\\ndetected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and photoluminescence (PL) mapping. PL\\nmapping reveals interference fringes in unbonded regions, indicating bonding\\nirregularities. Depth-resolved ODMR measurements show a volumetric strain\\ncomponent increase of ~0.45 MHz and a shear component increase of ~0.71 MHz\\nbetween the top surface and the DOI interface. However, ODMR signal contrast\\nand peak linewidth remain largely unaffected, suggesting no visible\\ndeterioration in the optical properties of the emitters. By combining ODMR and\\nPL mapping, this work establishes a robust methodology for assessing bonding\\nquality and strain impact on NV centers, an essential step toward advancing\\nscalable quantum technologies and integrated photonic circuits.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.app-ph,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:06:35Z\"}"}
