This work examines the Three Higgs Doublet\\nModel (3HDM) in a Type-Z or democratic setup, where each Higgs doublet couples\\nexclusively to a specific type of fermion. The particle spectrum of the 3HDM\\nincludes four charged Higgs bosons, two CP-odd scalars, and three CP-even\\nscalars. This work investigates the allowed mass and coupling parameter space\\nin the Type-Z 3HDM after imposing all theoretical and experimental constraints.\\nWe extract the allowed parameter space under three distinct alignment-limit\\nconditions or mass hierarchies leveraging machine learning techniques.\\nSpecifically, we analyze scenarios where the 125 GeV Higgs is the lightest, an\\nintermediary, or the heaviest CP-even Higgs boson. Our findings indicate that\\nwhile a single lighter CP-even Higgs boson below 125 GeV still remains a\\npossibility, the presence of two lighter Higgses is ruled out.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T06:46:09Z\"}"}
