However, simple experiments on human\\ndecision makers found them to be not fully rational, due to their subjective\\nrisk perception. Prospect theory was proposed as an empirically-grounded model\\nto incorporate irrational behaviours into game-theoretic models. But, how\\nprospect theory shapes the set of Nash equilibria when considering irrational\\nagents, is still poorly understood. To this end, we study how prospect\\ntheoretic transformations may generate new equilibria while eliminating\\nexisting ones. Focusing on aggregative games, we show that capturing users'\\nirrationality can preserve symmetric equilibria while causing the vanishing of\\nasymmetric equilibria. Further, there exist value functions which map\\nuncountable sets of equilibria in the expected-utility maximization framework\\nto finite sets. This last result may shape some equilibrium selection theories\\nfor human-in-the-loop systems where computing a single equilibrium is\\ninsufficient and comparison of equilibria is needed.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GT\", \"categories\": \"cs.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T09:33:07Z\"}"}
