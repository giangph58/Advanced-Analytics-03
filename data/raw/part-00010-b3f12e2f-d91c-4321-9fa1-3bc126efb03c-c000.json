This paper\\nintroduces and evaluates an automated high-frequency trading strategy for\\nbattery energy storage systems trading on the intraday market for power while\\nexplicitly considering the dynamics of the limit order book, market rules, and\\ntechnical parameters. The standard rolling intrinsic strategy is adapted for\\ncontinuous intraday electricity markets and solved using a dynamic programming\\napproximation that is two to three orders of magnitude faster than an exact\\nmixed-integer linear programming solution. A detailed backtest over a full year\\nof German order book data demonstrates that the proposed dynamic programming\\nformulation does not reduce trading profits and enables the policy to react to\\nevery relevant order book update, enabling realistic rapid backtesting. Our\\nresults show the significant revenue potential of high-frequency trading: our\\npolicy earns 58% more than when re-optimizing only once every hour and 14% more\\nthan when re-optimizing once per minute, highlighting that profits critically\\ndepend on trading speed. Furthermore, we leverage the speed of our algorithm to\\ntrain a parametric extension of the rolling intrinsic, increasing yearly\\nrevenue by 8.4% out of sample.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.TR\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.TR,cs.SY,eess.SY,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:38:09Z\"}"}
