Emotion recognition based on face tracking is often used to\\ncompensate for this. However, emotional facial expressions are highly\\nindividual, which is why many approaches have difficulties recognizing unique\\nvariations of emotional expressions. We propose several strategies to improve\\nface tracking systems for emotion recognition with and without user\\nintervention for the Affective Interaction Workshop at CHI '25.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:01:05Z\"}"}
