We identify four generic\\noperator structures that correspond to the irreducible representations in the\\nchiral group ${\\\\rm SU(3)}_{\\\\tt L}\\\\otimes {\\\\rm SU(3)}_{\\\\tt R}$ of QCD,\\n{$\\\\pmb{8}_{\\\\tt L}\\\\otimes \\\\pmb{1}_{\\\\tt R}$, $\\\\bar{\\\\pmb{3}}_{\\\\tt L}\\\\otimes\\n\\\\pmb{3}_{\\\\tt R}$, $\\\\pmb{6}_{\\\\tt L}\\\\otimes \\\\pmb{3}_{\\\\tt R}$, $\\\\pmb{10}_{\\\\tt\\nL}\\\\otimes \\\\pmb{1}_{\\\\tt R}$}, plus their chirality partners under the\\ninterchange of chiralities ${\\\\tt L}\\\\leftrightarrow {\\\\tt R}$. While half of them\\nhave been extensively discussed in the literature, the other half,\\n$\\\\pmb{6}_{\\\\tt L(R)}\\\\otimes \\\\pmb{3}_{\\\\tt R(L)}$ and $\\\\bar{\\\\pmb{10}}_{\\\\tt\\nL(R)}\\\\otimes \\\\pmb{1}_{\\\\tt R(L)}$, are identified for the first time. We perform\\nchiral matching for these interactions at the leading chiral order and find\\nthat each has a unique chiral realization in terms of the octet baryons and\\npseudoscalars. Notably, the chiral interaction in the $\\\\pmb{6}_{\\\\tt\\nL(R)}\\\\otimes \\\\pmb{3}_{\\\\tt R(L)}$ representation appears at the same chiral\\norder as those of the known ones, while the one in the $\\\\pmb{10}_{\\\\tt\\nL(R)}\\\\otimes \\\\pmb{1}_{\\\\tt R(L)}$ representation appears at a higher chiral\\norder. These new structures are prevalent in effective field theories and UV\\nmodels, and offer novel experimental avenues to search for baryon number\\nviolating nucleon decays.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T04:48:37Z\"}"}
