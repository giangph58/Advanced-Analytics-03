ARTEMIS takes a\\ndifferent method by generating trajectory waypoints sequentially, preserves\\ncritical temporal dependencies while dynamically routing scene-specific queries\\nto specialized expert networks. It effectively relieves trajectory quality\\ndegradation issues encountered when guidance information is ambiguous, and\\novercomes the inherent representational limitations of singular network\\narchitectures when processing diverse driving scenarios. Additionally, we use a\\nlightweight batch reallocation strategy that significantly improves the\\ntraining speed of the Mixture-of-Experts model. Through experiments on the\\nNAVSIM dataset, ARTEMIS exhibits superior competitive performance, achieving\\n87.0 PDMS and 83.1 EPDMS with ResNet-34 backbone, demonstrates state-of-the-art\\nperformance on multiple metrics.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T08:41:08Z\"}"}
