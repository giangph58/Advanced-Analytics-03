In particular, we study the case\\nwhere the expansion of $\\\\gamma+1$ is periodic. Under certain assumptions, the\\nbase satisfies algebraic properties. We compute the bounds for the norms of the\\nnontrivial Galois conjugates associated with the base; thereby, extending the\\nresults of Solomyak on the classical beta expansions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T04:21:34Z\"}"}
