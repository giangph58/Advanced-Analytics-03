{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05290v1\", \"title\": \"SmartTrap: Automated Precision Experiments with Optical Tweezers\", \"summary\": \"There is a trend in research towards more automation using smart systems\\npowered by artificial\\n  intelligence. While experiments are often challenging to automate, they can\\ngreatly benefit from\\n  automation by reducing labor and increasing reproducibility. For example,\\noptical tweezers are\\n  widely employed in single-molecule biophysics, cell biomechanics, and soft\\nmatter physics, but they\\n  still require a human operator, resulting in low throughput and limited\\nrepeatability. Here, we\\n  present a smart optical tweezers platform, which we name SmartTrap, capable\\nof performing complex\\n  experiments completely autonomously. SmartTrap integrates real-time 3D\\nparticle tracking using\\n  deep learning, custom electronics for precise feedback control, and a\\nmicrofluidic setup for particle\\n  handling. We demonstrate the ability of SmartTrap to operate continuously,\\nacquiring high-precision\\n  data over extended periods of time, through a series of experiments. By\\nbridging the gap between\\n  manual experimentation and autonomous operation, SmartTrap establishes a\\nrobust and open source\\n  framework for the next generation of optical tweezers research, capable of\\nperforming large-scale\\n  studies in single-molecule biophysics, cell mechanics, and colloidal science\\nwith reduced experimental\\n  overhead and operator bias.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.bio-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.bio-ph,cond-mat.soft,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:30:23Z\"}"}
