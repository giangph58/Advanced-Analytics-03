{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02727v1\", \"title\": \"Effect of new healthy and live food supplement on Anemia disease in\\n  Wistar rats\", \"summary\": \"Anemia is a decrease in hemoglobin and red blood cells and due to a decrease\\nin hemoglobin, oxygen carrying capacity reduce. In this disease, the red blood\\ncell the amount and volume decrease. In this research, healthy and live food\\npowder were synthesized by a green route. This organic biomaterial was named\\nNBS. The NBS healthy and live food powder has various vitamins, macro and micro\\nmolecules, and ingredients. Twenty Wistar rats were randomly divided into 4\\nequal groups, including control and treatment groups 1, 2 and 3. Nutritional\\nsupplements for healthy living were administered orally via gavage to rats in\\ngroups 1, 2, and 3 at 12.5, 25, and 50 mg/ kg, respectively, and within a\\nperiod of 20 days, one day in between. There was no intervention in the control\\ngroup in order to reach baseline blood factors. At the end of the study, blood\\nsamples were taken from the heart, including blood-red blood cells, hemoglobin,\\nhematocrit and platelets using a fully automated blood cell counting machine.\\nThe results showed that the new dietary supplement reduced the level of\\nhematocrit and platelets in the studied rats. The healthy and live food\\nsupplement at a concentration of 50 mg / kg increased blood levels compared to\\nthe control group. The results of this study showed that the use of healthy and\\nlive food supplement increased blood factors compared to the control group.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.CB\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.CB\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T16:11:14Z\"}"}
