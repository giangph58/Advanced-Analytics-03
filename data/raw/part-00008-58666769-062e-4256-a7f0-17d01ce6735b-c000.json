{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20504v1\", \"title\": \"Quality-factor inspired deep neural network solver for solving inverse\\n  scattering problems\", \"summary\": \"Deep neural networks have been applied to address electromagnetic inverse\\nscattering problems (ISPs) and shown superior imaging performances, which can\\nbe affected by the training dataset, the network architecture and the applied\\nloss function. Here, the quality of data samples is cared and valued by the\\ndefined quality factor. Based on the quality factor, the composition of the\\ntraining dataset is optimized. The network architecture is integrated with the\\nresidual connections and channel attention mechanism to improve feature\\nextraction. A loss function that incorporates data-fitting error,\\nphysical-information constraints and the desired feature of the solution is\\ndesigned and analyzed to suppress the background artifacts and improve the\\nreconstruction accuracy. Various numerical analysis are performed to\\ndemonstrate the superiority of the proposed quality-factor inspired deep neural\\nnetwork (QuaDNN) solver and the imaging performance is finally verified by\\nexperimental imaging test.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.LG,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T07:45:48Z\"}"}
