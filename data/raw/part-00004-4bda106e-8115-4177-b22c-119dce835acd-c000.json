The\\nhypertriton, the lightest three-body hypernuclear system, provides an ideal\\ntesting ground for investigating baryonic interactions and quark behavior\\ninvolving up, down, and strange quarks. However, experimental measurements of\\nits lifetime and binding energy, key indicators of baryonic interactions, show\\nsignificant deviations in results obtained from energetic collisions of\\nheavy-ion beams. Identifying alternative pathways for precisely measuring the\\nhypertriton's binding energy and lifetime is thus crucial for advancing\\nexperimental and theoretical nuclear physics. Here, we present an experimental\\nstudy on the binding energies of $^3_{\\\\Lambda}\\\\mathrm{H}$ (hypertriton) and\\n$^4_{\\\\Lambda}\\\\mathrm{H}$, performed through the analysis of photographic\\nnuclear emulsions using modern techniques. By incorporating deep-learning\\nmethods, we uncovered systematic uncertainties in conventional nuclear emulsion\\nanalyses and established a refined calibration protocol for determining binding\\nenergies accurately. Our results are independent of those obtained from\\nheavy-ion collision experiments, offering a complementary measurement and\\nopening new avenues for investigating few-body hypernuclei interactions.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-ex\", \"categories\": \"nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:08:40Z\"}"}
