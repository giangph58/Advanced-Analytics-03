{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20830v1\", \"title\": \"CMT: A Cascade MAR with Topology Predictor for Multimodal Conditional\\n  CAD Generation\", \"summary\": \"While accurate and user-friendly Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is crucial for\\nindustrial design and manufacturing, existing methods still struggle to achieve\\nthis due to their over-simplified representations or architectures incapable of\\nsupporting multimodal design requirements. In this paper, we attempt to tackle\\nthis problem from both methods and datasets aspects. First, we propose a\\ncascade MAR with topology predictor (CMT), the first multimodal framework for\\nCAD generation based on Boundary Representation (B-Rep). Specifically, the\\ncascade MAR can effectively capture the ``edge-counters-surface'' priors that\\nare essential in B-Reps, while the topology predictor directly estimates\\ntopology in B-Reps from the compact tokens in MAR. Second, to facilitate\\nlarge-scale training, we develop a large-scale multimodal CAD dataset, mmABC,\\nwhich includes over 1.3 million B-Rep models with multimodal annotations,\\nincluding point clouds, text descriptions, and multi-view images. Extensive\\nexperiments show the superior of CMT in both conditional and unconditional CAD\\ngeneration tasks. For example, we improve Coverage and Valid ratio by +10.68%\\nand +10.3%, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art methods on ABC in\\nunconditional generation. CMT also improves +4.01 Chamfer on image conditioned\\nCAD generation on mmABC. The dataset, code and pretrained network shall be\\nreleased.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:52:28Z\"}"}
