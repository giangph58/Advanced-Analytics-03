We first obtain the transition form factors within the\\nframework of the quark model, and then apply the obtained form factors to\\nobtain the branching fractions of semileptonic and nonleptonic decays. We also\\ncompare our results with experimental data and other theoretical predictions.\\nWe find that some branching fractions are sizable and might be accessible at\\nthe LHC and future $e^{+}$-$e^{-}$ colliders. Our work is expected to be of\\ngreat value for establishing corresponding decay channels, and also be helpful\\nin understanding the non-perturbative QCD dynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T12:32:18Z\"}"}
