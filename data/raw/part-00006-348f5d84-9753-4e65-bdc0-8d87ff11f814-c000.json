A\\npronounced resonant subthreshold structure of the generalized cross-section and\\nthe effect of destructive quantum interference of the probability amplitudes of\\nradiation transitions into virtual excited states of p-symmetry have been\\nestablished. The presence of a valence 2p$^6$-shell in the ion backbone causes\\nthe production of an additional giant resonance of the generalized\\ncross-section as the effect of the \\\"reverse\\\" hard X-ray emission of\\nK$\\\\alpha$-type 1s$^2$(2s$^2$)2p$^5$ + $\\\\hbar\\\\omega \\\\to$ 1s(2s$^2$)2p$^6$. A\\nscheme of the proposed experiment with linearly polarized X-ray photons is\\npresented to verify the theoretical results obtained.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T17:44:21Z\"}"}
