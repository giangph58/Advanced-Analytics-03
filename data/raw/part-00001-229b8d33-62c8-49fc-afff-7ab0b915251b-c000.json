{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07797v1\", \"title\": \"Event-Triggered Source Seeking Control for Nonholonomic Systems\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces an event-triggered source seeking control (ET-SSC) for\\nautonomous vehicles modeled as the nonholonomic unicycle. The classical source\\nseeking control is enhanced with static-triggering conditions to enable\\naperiodic and less frequent updates of the system's input signals, offering a\\nresource-aware control design. Our convergence analysis is based on\\ntime-scaling combined with Lyapunov and averaging theories for systems with\\ndiscontinuous right-hand sides. ET-SSC ensures exponentially stable behavior\\nfor the resulting average system, leading to practical asymptotic convergence\\nto a small neighborhood of the source point. We guarantee the avoidance of Zeno\\nbehavior by establishing a minimum dwell time to prevent infinitely fast\\nswitching. The performance optimization is aligned with classical\\ncontinuous-time source seeking algorithms while balancing system performance\\nwith actuation resource consumption. Our ET-SSC algorithm, the first of its\\nkind, allows for arbitrarily large inter-sampling times, overcoming the\\nlimitations of classical sampled-data implementations for source seeking\\ncontrol.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:36:56Z\"}"}
