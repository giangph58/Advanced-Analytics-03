One way to create HOI data is\\nto transfer hand poses from a source object to another based on the objects'\\ngeometry. However, current methods for transferring hand poses between objects\\nrely on shape matching, limiting the ability to transfer poses across different\\ncategories due to differences in their shapes and sizes. We observe that HOI\\noften involves specific semantic parts of objects, which often have more\\nconsistent shapes across categories. In addition, constructing size-invariant\\ncorrespondences between these parts is important for cross-category transfer.\\nBased on these insights, we introduce a novel method PartHOI for part-based HOI\\ntransfer. Using a generalized cylinder representation to parameterize an object\\nparts' geometry, PartHOI establishes a robust geometric correspondence between\\nobject parts, and enables the transfer of contact points. Given the transferred\\npoints, we optimize a hand pose to fit the target object well. Qualitative and\\nquantitative results demonstrate that our method can generalize HOI transfers\\nwell even for cross-category objects, and produce high-fidelity results that\\nare superior to the existing methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T09:56:29Z\"}"}
