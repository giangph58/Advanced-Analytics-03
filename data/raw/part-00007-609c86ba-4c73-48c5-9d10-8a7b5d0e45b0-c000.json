Firstly, the existence and\\nuniqueness of invariant probability measure and the uniform geometric\\nergodicity of the chain are studied through introduction of non-atomic Markov\\nchains. Secondly, the equivalent conditions for uniform geometric ergodicity of\\nthe chain are discovered, by constructing a split Markov chain based on the\\noriginal Euler-Maruyama scheme. It turns out that this convergence rate is\\nindependent with the step size under total variation distance.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:16:57Z\"}"}
