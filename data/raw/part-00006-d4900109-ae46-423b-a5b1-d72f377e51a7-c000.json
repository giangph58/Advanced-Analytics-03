First, we\\nextend the concept of the teardrop hovering formation to scenarios along the\\nNear Rectilinear Halo orbit in the Earth-Moon circular restricted three-body\\nproblem. Then, we develop two methods for designing these formations based on\\nthe nonlinear model for relative motion. The first method addresses the design\\nof the teardrop hovering formations with relatively short revisit distances,\\nwhile the second method continues hovering trajectories from short to longer\\nrevisit distances. In particular, new continuation method is developed to meet\\nthe design requirements of this new scenario. Simulation results verify the\\neffectiveness of the proposed methods, and a near-natural teardrop hovering\\nformation is achieved by considering the dynamical properties near the NRHO.\\nComparisons between design results obtained using linear and nonlinear models\\nfurther strengthen the necessity of using the nonlinear model.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T05:20:48Z\"}"}
