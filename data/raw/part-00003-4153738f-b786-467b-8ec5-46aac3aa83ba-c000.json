In this paper, we present a stochastic interacting particle-field\\nalgorithm with random batch approximation (SIPF-$r$) for the three-dimensional\\n(3D) parabolic-parabolic Keller-Segel (KS) system, also known as the fully\\nparabolic KS system. The SIPF-$r$ method approximates the KS system by coupling\\nparticle-based representations of density with a smooth field variable computed\\nusing spectral methods. By incorporating the random batch method (RBM), we\\nbypass the mean-field limit and significantly reduce computational complexity.\\nUnder mild assumptions on the regularity of the original KS system and the\\nboundedness of numerical approximations, we prove that, with high probability,\\nthe empirical measure of the SIPF-$r$ particle system converges to the exact\\nmeasure of the limiting McKean-Vlasov process in the $1$-Wasserstein distance.\\nNumerical experiments validate the theoretical convergence rates and\\ndemonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the SIPF-$r$ method.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T10:53:40Z\"}"}
