We\\nshow that, under suitable conditions on the separation of spectral gaps and the\\nboundedness of parameter dispersion, rotating wave and adiabatic approximations\\ncan be employed in cascade to achieve population inversion between arbitrary\\neigenstates. We propose an explicit control law and test numerically the\\nsharpness of the conditions on several examples.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T06:58:26Z\"}"}
