{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03489v1\", \"title\": \"Power Loss and Temperature Distribution in Coil of PFC Inductor with Air\\n  Gap for Multimode Operation\", \"summary\": \"Power converters inherently display non-linear load characteristics,\\nresulting in a high level of mains harmonics, and hence the necessity of\\nimplementing Power Factor Correction (PFC). Active PFC circuitry typically\\ncomprises an inductor and a power switch to control and alter the input current\\nso that it matches, in shape and phase, the input voltage. This modelling of\\nthe waveforms can be performed by means of distinct conduction modes of the PFC\\ninductor. The digital controller implemented in the constructed and\\ninvestigated boost-type PFC converter can be programmed to operate in\\ndiscontinuous conduction mode (DCM), continuous conduction mode (CCM), or a\\ncombination of the two. The individual modes of operation, via distinct PFC\\ninductor current waveforms, impact the overall efficiency of power conversion\\nand, by extension, temperature distribution in the magnetic component. This\\npaper investigates how the examined conduction modes bear on distinct\\npower-loss mechanisms present in the PFC inductor, including high-frequency\\neddy-current-generating phenomena, and the fringing effect in particular. As\\ndemonstrated herein, the DCM operation, for the set output power level,\\nexhibits exacerbated power dissipation in the winding of the inductor due to\\nthe somewhat increased RSM value of the current and the intensified fringing\\nmagnetic flux at an air gap. The latter assertion will undergo further, more\\nquantitatively focused research. Finally, the construction of the coil was\\noptimised to reduce power loss by diminishing eddy-current mechanisms.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T12:45:52Z\"}"}
