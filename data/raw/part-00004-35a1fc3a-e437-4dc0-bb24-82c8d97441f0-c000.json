Separately, robustness to corrupted data in the\\ncontext of federated learning has also been studied. In this paper we explore\\ncombining personalization for heterogeneous data with robustness, where a\\nconstant fraction of the clients are corrupted. Motivated by this broad\\nproblem, we formulate a simple instantiation which captures some of its\\ndifficulty. We focus on the specific problem of personalized mean estimation\\nwhere the data is drawn from a Gaussian mixture model. We give an algorithm\\nwhose error depends almost linearly on the ratio of corrupted to uncorrupted\\nsamples, and show a lower bound with the same behavior, albeit with a gap of a\\nconstant factor.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:24:54Z\"}"}
