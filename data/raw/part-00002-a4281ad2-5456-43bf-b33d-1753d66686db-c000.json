For this setup, we\\nconsider secrecy, where each user should not know anything about the files it\\ndid not request, and demand privacy, where each user's demand must be kept\\nprivate from other non-colluding users. We propose a scheme satisfying both\\nconditions and derive a lower bound based on cut-set arguments. Also, we prove\\nthat our scheme is optimal when $r\\\\geq C-1$, and it is order-optimal when the\\ncache memory size $M$ is greater than or equal to a certain threshold for\\n$r<C-1$. When $r=1$, in most of the memory region, our scheme achieves the same\\nrate as the one given by the secretive scheme for the dedicated cache setup by\\nRavindrakumar et al. ( 'Private Coded Caching,' in \\\\textit{IEEE Transactions on\\nInformation Forensics and Security}, 2018), while satisfying both secrecy and\\ndemand privacy conditions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T07:30:03Z\"}"}
