These models are being deployed as\\ngeneral-purpose intelligence systems in many applications. Central to their\\nutility is the capacity to understand natural language commands and exploit the\\nreasoning embedded in human text corpora to apply some form of reasoning\\nprocess to a wide variety of novel tasks. To understand the limitations of this\\napproach to generating reasoning we argue that we need to consider the\\narchitectural constraints of these systems. Consideration of the latent\\nvariable structure of transformer-decoder models allows us to design reasoning\\ntasks that should probe the boundary of their capacity to reason. We present\\nenigme, an open-source library for generating text-based puzzles to be used in\\ntraining and evaluating reasoning skills within transformer-decoder models and\\nfuture AI architectures.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.CL,I.2.7\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T03:09:57Z\"}"}
