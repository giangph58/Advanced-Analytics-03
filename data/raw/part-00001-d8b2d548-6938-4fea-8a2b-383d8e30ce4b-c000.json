However, a priori\\nfeature selection leads to high complexity, which can be detrimental to both\\ncomputational cost and generalization, resulting in a need for hyperparameter\\ntuning. We demonstrate the benefits of active set algorithms for automated\\ndata-driven feature selection. The proposed methods are implemented within the\\nAtomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) framework. Computational tests conducted on a\\nvariety of benchmark datasets indicate that sparse ACE models consistently\\nenhance computational efficiency, generalization accuracy and interpretability\\nover dense ACE models. An added benefit of the proposed algorithms is that they\\nproduce entire paths of models with varying cost/accuracy ratio.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.comp-ph,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T04:53:29Z\"}"}
