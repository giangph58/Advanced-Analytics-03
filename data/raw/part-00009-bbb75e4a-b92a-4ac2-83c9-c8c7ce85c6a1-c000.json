In strong\\nmagnetic fields beyond 100 T, the significant Zeeman energy competes with the\\nlattice interactions, where one can expect considerable magnetostriction.\\nHowever, directly observing magnetostriction above 100 T is challenging,\\nbecause generating magnetic fields beyond 100 T accompanies the destruction of\\nthe coil with a single-shot $\\\\mu$-second pulse. Here, we observed the giant and\\nanisotropic magnetostriction of $\\\\sim$1 % at 110 T in the spin-controlled\\ncrystal of $\\\\beta$-O$_{2}$, by combining the single-shot diffraction of x-ray\\nfree-electron laser (XFEL) and the state-of-the-art portable 100 T generator.\\nThe magnetostriction of $\\\\sim$1 % is the largest class as a deformation of the\\nunit cell. It is a response of the soft lattice of $\\\\beta$-O$_{2}$ originating,\\nnot only in the competing van der Waals force and exchange interaction, but\\nalso the soft state of spin and lattice frustrated on the triangular network.\\nMeanwhile, the anisotropy originates from the strong two-dimensionality of the\\nspin system. Giant magnetostriction in crystals should become more ubiquitous\\nand diverse beyond 100 T, where our XFEL experiment above 100 T opens a novel\\npathway for their exploration, providing fundamental insights into the roles of\\nspin in stabilizing crystal structures.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T10:42:02Z\"}"}
