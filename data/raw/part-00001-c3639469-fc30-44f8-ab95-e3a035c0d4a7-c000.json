Entangled states\\nhave been proposed to enhance the efficiency of two-photon interactions and\\nhave shown effectiveness at low intensities. This quantum enhancement is\\ngenerally believed to be lost at high intensities, for more than one photon per\\nmode, raising doubts about its usefulness. We explored experimentally and\\ntheoretically two-photon processes driven by entangled photons at intensities\\nbeyond this threshold and compared the results with the classical case. We\\nfound that a quantum advantage can still be observed at nearly one order of\\nmagnitude higher intensities than previously assumed. Our findings show a\\npotential path for exploiting quantum-enhanced two-photon processes in\\npractical applications.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T17:27:26Z\"}"}
