{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15563v1\", \"title\": \"Designing Optimal Distorted-Octahedra Superlattices for Strong\\n  Topological Hall Effect\", \"summary\": \"Topologically protected spin states hold great promise for applications in\\nnext generation of memory circuits and spintronic devices. These intriguing\\ntextures typically emerge in bulk materials or heterostructures with broken\\ninversion symmetry, accompanied by an enhanced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\\ninteraction (DMI). In this study, we successfully induced the topological Hall\\neffect (THE) in atomically designed (DyScO3)n/(SrRuO3)n (DnSn) superlattices\\nover a significant range of temperatures (10~120K) and thicknesses (16~40nm).\\nUsing magnetic force microscopy (MFM), we observed the formation and stability\\nof magnetic domains, such as topological skyrmions. By precisely controlling\\nthe interlayer thickness (n) and biaxial strain, we elucidated the mechanisms\\nunderlying the modulation and induction of magnetic topological states.\\nSupporting evidence was provided by scanning transmission electron microscopy\\n(STEM) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), thereby lending further\\ncredence to our conclusions. These heterostructures offer a universal method\\nfor exploring topological phenomena driven by distorted octahedra, while\\nenhancing the integrability and addressability of topologically protected\\nfunctional devices.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T03:32:05Z\"}"}
