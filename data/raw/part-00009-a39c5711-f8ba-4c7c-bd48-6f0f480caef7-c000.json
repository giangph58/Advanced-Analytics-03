The underlying photonic spin of the AC\\nmagnetic field governs the orbital polarization that flows along the gradient\\nof the driven field. Due to the orbital texture, the orbital Hall current that\\nflows perpendicularly to the gradient of the AC field is also generated and\\ndoes not suffer from the orbital torque. These findings extend the paradigm of\\norbital pumping to include photonic spin and pave the way for developing\\nlow-dissipation orbitronic devices.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:08:10Z\"}"}
