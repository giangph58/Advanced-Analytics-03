Successful\\nobservations of the solar vector magnetic field have been conducted during its\\noperation. Based on the achievements at Huairou, we analyze the methods of\\nobserving the solar magnetic field, including discussions of the approximation\\nof the transfer theory of the solar magnetic field in the atmosphere, wide\\nfield of view polarized observation, and some questions on the inversion of\\nsolar magnetic field data. We also present relevant challenges for further\\nresearch.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T05:58:33Z\"}"}
