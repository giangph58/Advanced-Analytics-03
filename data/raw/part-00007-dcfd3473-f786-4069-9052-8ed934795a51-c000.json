Accurate quantum chemistry simulations are a useful tool to help\\nselect and design optimal MOF structures, replacing costly or impractical\\nexperiments or providing chemically inspired features for data-driven\\napproaches such as machine learning. However, applying simulations over large\\ndatasets requires efficient simulation methods such as Density Functional\\nTheory (DFT) which, despite often being accurate, introduces uncontrolled\\napproximations and a lack of systematic improvability. In this work we outline\\na hierarchical cluster model that includes a recently developed quantum\\nembedding that provides a more systematic approach to efficiently tune\\naccuracy. We apply this workflow to calculate the binding affinity for a small\\nset of MOF structures and $\\\\text{CO}_{2}$ using experimentally measured heat of\\nadsorption as a reference. Since quantum embeddings have also been proposed as\\na framework to accelerate the utility of quantum hardware, we discuss some of\\nthe benefits and challenges of integrating quantum solvers into the workflow\\noutlined in this work.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T16:00:07Z\"}"}
