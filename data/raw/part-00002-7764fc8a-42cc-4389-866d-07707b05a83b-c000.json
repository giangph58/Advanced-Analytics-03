{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12228v1\", \"title\": \"Data Assimilation for Robust UQ Within Agent-Based Simulation on HPC\\n  Systems\", \"summary\": \"Agent-based simulation provides a powerful tool for in silico system\\nmodeling. However, these simulations do not provide built-in methods for\\nuncertainty quantification (UQ). Within these types of models a typical\\napproach to UQ is to run multiple realizations of the model then compute\\naggregate statistics. This approach is limited due to the compute time required\\nfor a solution. When faced with an emerging biothreat, public health decisions\\nneed to be made quickly and solutions for integrating near real-time data with\\nanalytic tools are needed.\\n  We propose an integrated Bayesian UQ framework for agent-based models based\\non sequential Monte Carlo sampling. Given streaming or static data about the\\nevolution of an emerging pathogen, this Bayesian framework provides a\\ndistribution over the parameters governing the spread of a disease through a\\npopulation. These estimates of the spread of a disease may be provided to\\npublic health agencies seeking to abate the spread.\\n  By coupling agent-based simulations with Bayesian modeling in a data\\nassimilation, our proposed framework provides a powerful tool for modeling\\ndynamical systems in silico. We propose a method which reduces model error and\\nprovides a range of realistic possible outcomes. Moreover, our method addresses\\ntwo primary limitations of ABMs: the lack of UQ and an inability to assimilate\\ndata. Our proposed framework combines the flexibility of an agent-based model\\nwith UQ provided by the Bayesian paradigm in a workflow which scales well to\\nHPC systems. We provide algorithmic details and results on a simulated outbreak\\nwith both static and streaming data.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP,stat.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T16:23:28Z\"}"}
