We devise a simpler, more naive\\nversion of the explain operation whose soundness and completeness is easy to\\nverify. Then, we prove the original formulation of the explain operation to be\\nequal to our version. Finally, we refine this data structure to Imperative HOL,\\nenabling us to export efficient imperative code. The formalisation provides a\\nstepping stone towards the verification of proof-producing congruence closure\\nalgorithms which are a core ingredient of Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)\\nsolvers.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LO\", \"categories\": \"cs.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T14:09:09Z\"}"}
