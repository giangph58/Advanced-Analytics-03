{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04622v1\", \"title\": \"PrimitiveAnything: Human-Crafted 3D Primitive Assembly Generation with\\n  Auto-Regressive Transformer\", \"summary\": \"Shape primitive abstraction, which decomposes complex 3D shapes into simple\\ngeometric elements, plays a crucial role in human visual cognition and has\\nbroad applications in computer vision and graphics. While recent advances in 3D\\ncontent generation have shown remarkable progress, existing primitive\\nabstraction methods either rely on geometric optimization with limited semantic\\nunderstanding or learn from small-scale, category-specific datasets, struggling\\nto generalize across diverse shape categories. We present PrimitiveAnything, a\\nnovel framework that reformulates shape primitive abstraction as a primitive\\nassembly generation task. PrimitiveAnything includes a shape-conditioned\\nprimitive transformer for auto-regressive generation and an ambiguity-free\\nparameterization scheme to represent multiple types of primitives in a unified\\nmanner. The proposed framework directly learns the process of primitive\\nassembly from large-scale human-crafted abstractions, enabling it to capture\\nhow humans decompose complex shapes into primitive elements. Through extensive\\nexperiments, we demonstrate that PrimitiveAnything can generate high-quality\\nprimitive assemblies that better align with human perception while maintaining\\ngeometric fidelity across diverse shape categories. It benefits various 3D\\napplications and shows potential for enabling primitive-based user-generated\\ncontent (UGC) in games.
