Compared to previous studies, we consider a\\nmore realistic $c\\\\bar c$ potential with including the spin-dependent\\ninteractions, which allows us to obtain more states and get more insights on\\nthe charmonium spectrum. Based on our calculation, we obtain the masses of the\\ncharmonium spectrum which align with the experimental data well. We also\\npresent the probabilities of finding various components, i.e. $c\\\\bar c$ or\\nmeson-meson pair, in those states. Our results support the arguments that the\\n$\\\\chi_{c1}(3872)$, $\\\\psi(4040)$ and $\\\\chi_{c2}(3930)$ have significant\\nmolecular components. In addition, our calculations show that the\\n$\\\\chi_{c0}(3860)$ and $\\\\psi(3770)$ can be looked as the candidates for the\\ncharmonium states $\\\\chi_{c0}(2P)$ and $\\\\psi(1D)$, respectively.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T14:57:29Z\"}"}
