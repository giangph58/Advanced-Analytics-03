The system is modeled via a massless scalar\\nfield between perfectly reflecting parallel planes with Dirichlet, Neumann, and\\nmixed boundary conditions. Exact closed-form expressions are derived for the\\nmean square mass density, total energy density, and thermodynamic quantities\\nincluding Helmholtz free energy and entropy densities. Our analysis identifies\\ndistinct regimes, namely, a low-temperature quantum regime exhibiting\\ncharacteristic power-law behavior for each boundary condition, and a\\nhigh-temperature classical regime where $\\\\hbar$-independent behavior emerges as\\nexpected. A particularly interesting finding shows that while most quantities\\ntransition naturally to classical behavior, the mean square density fluctuation\\nrequires explicit consideration of the $\\\\hbar\\\\to 0$ limit. The entropy density\\nvanishes at zero temperature, in agreement with the Nernst heat theorem.\\nNumerical analysis confirms our analytical results, particularly the asymptotic\\ntemperature behaviors and the intermediate crossover region, in which quantum\\nand classical effects compete. This regime is governed by the energy scale $k_B\\nT \\\\sim \\\\hbar u / a$, where $a$ is the distance between the planes and $u$ is\\nthe sound velocity.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech,hep-th,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T16:07:19Z\"}"}
