{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16495v1\", \"title\": \"Quasi-triangular and factorizable perm bialgebras\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we introduce the notions of quasi-triangular and factorizable\\nperm bialgebras, based on notions of the perm Yang-Baxter equation and $(R,\\n\\\\mathrm{ad})$-invariant condition. A factorizable perm bialgebra induces a\\nfactorization of the underlying perm algebra and the double of a perm bialgebra\\nnaturally admits a factorizable perm bialgebra structure. The notion of\\nrelative Rota-Baxter operators of weights on perm algebras is introduced to\\ncharacterize solutions of the perm Yang-Baxter equation, whose skew-symmetric\\nparts are $(R, \\\\mathrm{ad})$-invariant. These operators are in one-to-one\\ncorrespondence with linear transformations fulfilling a Rota-Baxter-type\\nidentity in the case of quadratic perm algebras. Furthermore, we introduce the\\nnotion of quadratic Rota-Baxter perm algebras of weights, demonstrate that a\\nquadratic Rota-Baxter perm algebra of weight $0$ induces a triangular perm\\nbialgebra, and establish a one-to-one correspondence between quadratic\\nRota-Baxter perm algebras of nonzero weights and factorizable perm bialgebras.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RT\", \"categories\": \"math.RT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T08:17:53Z\"}"}
