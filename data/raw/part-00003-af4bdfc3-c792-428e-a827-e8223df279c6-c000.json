This automation\\ndrives digital transformation, often through gradual transitions that improve\\nprocess efficiency and effectiveness. To fully assess the impact of such\\nautomation, a data-driven analysis approach is needed - one that examines how\\ntraditional and AI-enhanced process variants coexist during this transition.\\nObject-Centric Process Mining (OCPM) has emerged as a valuable method that\\nenables such analysis, yet real-world case studies are still needed to\\ndemonstrate its applicability. This paper presents a case study from the\\ninsurance sector, where an LLM was deployed in production to automate the\\nidentification of claim parts, a task previously performed manually and\\nidentified as a bottleneck for scalability. To evaluate this transformation, we\\napply OCPM to assess the impact of AI-driven automation on process scalability.\\nOur findings indicate that while LLMs significantly enhance operational\\ncapacity, they also introduce new process dynamics that require further\\nrefinement. This study also demonstrates the practical application of OCPM in a\\nreal-world setting, highlighting its advantages and limitations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T06:43:29Z\"}"}
