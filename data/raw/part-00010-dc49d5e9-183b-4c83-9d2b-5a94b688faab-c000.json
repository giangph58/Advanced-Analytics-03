We demonstrate\\nthat swarms optimisation algorithms also exhibit transitions from chaos,\\nanalogous to motion of gas molecules, when particles explore solution space\\ndisorderly, to order, when particles follow a leader, similar to molecules\\npropagating along diffusion gradients in liquid solutions of reagents. We\\nanalyse these `phase-like' transitions in swarm optimization algorithms using\\nrecurrence quantification analysis and Lempel-Ziv complexity estimation. We\\ndemonstrate that converging and non-converging iterations of the optimization\\nalgorithms are statistically different in a view of applied chaos, complexity\\nand predictability estimating indicators.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.comp-ph,nlin.CD,physics.data-an\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:33:49Z\"}"}
