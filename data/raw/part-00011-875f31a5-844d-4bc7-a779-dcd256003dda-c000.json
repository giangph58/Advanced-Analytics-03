We estimate by means of numerical\\nsimulation what could be the gain value at that concentration by modeling ORN\\nas a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron with membrane populated by receptor\\nproteins R which bind and release odor molecules randomly. Each R is modeled as\\na ligand-gated ion channel, and binding-releasing is modeled as a Markov\\nstochastic process. Possible values for the selectivity gain are calculated for\\nORN parameters suggested by experimental data.\\n  Keywords: ORN, selectivity, receptor proteins, fluctuations, stochastic\\nprocess, Markov process\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.NC\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.NC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:51:25Z\"}"}
