Also we make a simple condition of\\nfiniteness. We use these processes to model a data set consisting of electrical\\ndistribution networks, where we make a flexible framework for formulating\\nmodels through the mean and variance of the offspring distributions.\\nFurthermore, we introduce two mixture distributions as offspring distributions\\nto reflect the particular form of the data. For estimation we use maximum\\nlikelihood estimation.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T09:44:06Z\"}"}
