{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15613v1\", \"title\": \"Learning Dynamic Graphs via Tensorized and Lightweight Graph\\n  Convolutional Networks\", \"summary\": \"A dynamic graph (DG) is frequently encountered in numerous real-world\\nscenarios. Consequently, A dynamic graph convolutional network (DGCN) has been\\nsuccessfully applied to perform precise representation learning on a DG.\\nHowever, conventional DGCNs typically consist of a static GCN coupled with a\\nsequence neural network (SNN) to model spatial and temporal patterns\\nseparately. This decoupled modeling mechanism inherently disrupts the intricate\\nspatio-temporal dependencies. To address the issue, this study proposes a novel\\nTensorized Lightweight Graph Convolutional Network (TLGCN) for accurate dynamic\\ngraph learning. It mainly contains the following two key concepts: a) designing\\na novel spatio-temporal information propagation method for joint propagation of\\nspatio-temporal information based on the tensor M-product framework; b)\\nproposing a tensorized lightweight graph convolutional network based on the\\nabove method, which significantly reduces the memory occupation of the model by\\nomitting complex feature transformation and nonlinear activation. Numerical\\nexperiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed TLGCN\\noutperforms the state-of-the-art models in the weight estimation task on DGs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T06:13:32Z\"}"}
