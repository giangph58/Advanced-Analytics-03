However, such analysis presents\\nadditional challenges for the case of homogeneous Neumann boundary condition.\\nIn this work the Strang splitting method with variable time steps is\\ninvestigated for solving the Allen--Cahn equation with homogeneous Neumann\\nboundary conditions. Uniform $H^k$-norm stability is established under the\\nassumption that the initial condition $u^0$ belongs to the Sobolev space\\n$H^k(\\\\Omega)$ with integer $k\\\\ge 0$, using the Gagliardo--Nirenberg\\ninterpolation inequality and the Sobolev embedding inequality. Furthermore,\\nrigorous convergence analysis is provided in the $H^k$-norm for initial\\nconditions $u^0 \\\\in H^{k+6}(\\\\Omega)$, based on the uniform stability. Several\\nnumerical experiments are conducted to verify the theoretical results,\\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T07:33:42Z\"}"}
