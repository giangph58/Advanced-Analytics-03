This damage is particularly prevalent in rural\\nareas due to less frequent surveying and maintenance of roads. Automated\\ndetection of pavement deterioration can be used as an input to AVs and driver\\nassistance systems to improve road safety. Current research in this field has\\npredominantly focused on urban environments driven largely by public datasets,\\nwhile rural areas have received significantly less attention. This paper\\nintroduces M2S-RoAD, a dataset for the semantic segmentation of different\\nclasses of road damage. M2S-RoAD was collected in various towns across New\\nSouth Wales, Australia, and labelled for semantic segmentation to identify nine\\ndistinct types of road damage. This dataset will be released upon the\\nacceptance of the paper.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T11:32:01Z\"}"}
