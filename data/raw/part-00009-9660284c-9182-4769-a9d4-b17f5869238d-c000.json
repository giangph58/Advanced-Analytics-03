{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14901v1\", \"title\": \"Inverse design of ultrathin metamaterial absorber\", \"summary\": \"Electromagnetic absorbers combining ultrathin profiles with robust\\nabsorptivity across wide incidence angles are essential for applications such\\nas stealth technology, wireless communications, and quantum computing.\\nTraditional designs, including Salisbury screens, typically require thicknesses\\nof at least a quarter-wavelength (lambda/4), which limits their use in compact\\nsystems. While metamaterial absorbers (MMAs) can reduce thickness, their\\nabsorptivity generally decreases under oblique incidence conditions. Here, we\\nintroduce an adjoint optimization-based inverse design method that merges the\\nultrathin advantage of MMAs with the angle-insensitive characteristics of\\nSalisbury screens. By leveraging the computational efficiency of the adjoint\\nmethod, we systematically optimize absorber structures as thin as lambda/20.\\nThe optimized designs achieve absorption exceeding 90% at the target frequency\\nof 7.5 GHz and demonstrate robust performance under oblique incidence,\\nmaintaining over 90% absorption up to 50{\\\\deg}, approximately 80% at 60{\\\\deg},\\nand around 70% at 70{\\\\deg}. Comparative analysis against particle swarm\\noptimization highlights the superior efficiency of the adjoint method, reducing\\ncomputational effort by approximately 98%. This inverse design framework thus\\nprovides substantial improvements in both performance and computational cost,\\noffering a promising approach for advanced electromagnetic absorber design.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T07:14:36Z\"}"}
