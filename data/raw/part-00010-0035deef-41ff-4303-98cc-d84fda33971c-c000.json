{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21719v1\", \"title\": \"Sionna RT: Technical Report\", \"summary\": \"Sionna is an open-source, GPU-accelerated library that, as of version 0.14,\\nincorporates a ray tracer for simulating radio wave propagation. A unique\\nfeature of Sionna RT is differentiability, enabling the calculation of\\ngradients for the channel impulse responses (CIRs), radio maps, and other\\nrelated metrics with respect to system and environmental parameters, such as\\nmaterial properties, antenna patterns, and array geometries. The release of\\nSionna 1.0 provides a complete overhaul of the ray tracer, significantly\\nimproving its speed, memory efficiency, and extensibility. This document\\ndetails the algorithms employed by Sionna RT to simulate radio wave propagation\\nefficiently, while also addressing their current limitations. Given that the\\ncomputation of CIRs and radio maps requires distinct algorithms, these are\\ndetailed in separate sections. For CIRs, Sionna RT integrates shooting and\\nbouncing of rays (SBR) with the image method and uses a hashing-based mechanism\\nto efficiently eliminate duplicate paths. Radio maps are computed using a\\npurely SBR-based approach.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,cs.AI,eess.SP,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T15:05:20Z\"}"}
