Namely, it is shown that, whenever\\n$X$ is a topological $\\\\bigwedge$-semilattice, the canonical forgetful functor\\n$\\\\mathsf{Top} \\\\Downarrow X \\\\to \\\\mathsf{Top}$ is topological, preserves and\\nreflects exponentials, and preserves effective descent morphisms. Moreover,\\nunder additional conditions on $X$, a characterisation of effective descent\\nmorphisms is obtained.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CT\", \"categories\": \"math.CT,math.GN\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T14:18:42Z\"}"}
