Beyond a quark interaction kernel representing\\ngluon-mediated interactions, leading beyond-rainbow-ladder effects at low\\nenergies are incorporated by back-coupling pions as explicit degrees of\\nfreedom. Building upon an earlier calculation of the quark-photon vertex that\\ncaptures the branch cut associated with the two-pion threshold and the rho\\nmeson resonance, the form factor $F_\\\\3pi(s,t,u)$ is determined for timelike\\nMandelstam s. In particular, predictions are made for the kinematics relevant\\nfor the Primakoff reaction studied with COMPASS/AMBER at CERN.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T16:15:43Z\"}"}
