{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04931v1\", \"title\": \"Fair Uncertainty Quantification for Depression Prediction\", \"summary\": \"Trustworthy depression prediction based on deep learning, incorporating both\\npredictive reliability and algorithmic fairness across diverse demographic\\ngroups, is crucial for clinical application. Recently, achieving reliable\\ndepression predictions through uncertainty quantification has attracted\\nincreasing attention. However, few studies have focused on the fairness of\\nuncertainty quantification (UQ) in depression prediction. In this work, we\\ninvestigate the algorithmic fairness of UQ, namely Equal Opportunity Coverage\\n(EOC) fairness, and propose Fair Uncertainty Quantification (FUQ) for\\ndepression prediction. FUQ pursues reliable and fair depression predictions\\nthrough group-based analysis. Specifically, we first group all the participants\\nby different sensitive attributes and leverage conformal prediction to quantify\\nuncertainty within each demographic group, which provides a theoretically\\nguaranteed and valid way to quantify uncertainty for depression prediction and\\nfacilitates the investigation of fairness across different demographic groups.\\nFurthermore, we propose a fairness-aware optimization strategy that formulates\\nfairness as a constrained optimization problem under EOC constraints. This\\nenables the model to preserve predictive reliability while adapting to the\\nheterogeneous uncertainty levels across demographic groups, thereby achieving\\noptimal fairness. Through extensive evaluations on several visual and audio\\ndepression datasets, our approach demonstrates its effectiveness.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T04:09:36Z\"}"}
