{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15838v1\", \"title\": \"Gaussian behaviors: representations and data-driven control\", \"summary\": \"We propose a modeling framework for stochastic systems based on Gaussian\\nprocesses. Finite-length trajectories of the system are modeled as random\\nvectors from a Gaussian distribution, which we call a Gaussian behavior. The\\nproposed model naturally quantifies the uncertainty in the trajectories, yet it\\nis simple enough to allow for tractable formulations. We relate the proposed\\nmodel to existing descriptions of dynamical systems including deterministic and\\nstochastic behaviors, and linear time-invariant (LTI) state-space models with\\nGaussian process and measurement noise. Gaussian behaviors can be estimated\\ndirectly from observed data as the empirical sample covariance under the\\nassumption that the measured trajectories are from independent experiments. The\\ndistribution of future outputs conditioned on inputs and past outputs provides\\na predictive model that can be incorporated in predictive control frameworks.\\nWe show that subspace predictive control (SPC) is a certainty-equivalence\\ncontrol formulation with the estimated Gaussian behavior. Furthermore, the\\nregularized data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) method is shown to be a\\ndistributionally optimistic formulation that optimistically accounts for\\nuncertainty in the Gaussian behavior. To mitigate the excessive optimism of\\nDeePC, we propose a novel distributionally robust control formulation, and\\nprovide a convex reformulation allowing for efficient implementation.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T12:31:10Z\"}"}
