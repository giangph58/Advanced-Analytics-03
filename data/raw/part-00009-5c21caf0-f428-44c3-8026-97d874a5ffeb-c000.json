In this work, we characterise the chance constrained TTP using a\\nlimited number of weighted scenarios. Each scenario represents a similar TTP\\ninstance, differing slightly in the weight profile of the items and associated\\nwith a certain probability of occurrence. Collectively, the weighted scenarios\\nrepresent a relaxed form of a stochastic TTP instance where the objective is to\\nmaximise the expected benefit while satisfying the knapsack constraint with a\\nlarger probability. We incorporate a set of evolutionary algorithms and\\nheuristic procedures developed for the classical TTP, and formulate adaptations\\nthat apply to the weighted scenario-based representation of the problem. The\\nanalysis focuses on the performance of the algorithms on different settings and\\nexamines the impact of uncertainty on the quality of the solutions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NE\", \"categories\": \"cs.NE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T03:30:21Z\"}"}
