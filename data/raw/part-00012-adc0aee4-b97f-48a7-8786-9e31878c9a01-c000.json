Many NP-hard problems can be efficiently\\naddressed using hybrid classical and quantum computational methods. This paper\\nproposes a hybrid variational quantum algorithm designed to solve the\\n$k$-coloring problem of graph vertices. The hybrid classical and quantum\\nalgorithms primarily partition the graph into multiple subgraphs through\\nhierarchical techniques. The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)\\nis employed to determine the coloring within the subgraphs, while a classical\\ngreedy algorithm is utilized to find the coloring of the interaction graph.\\nFixed coloring is applied to the interaction graph, and feedback is provided to\\ncorrect any conflicting colorings within the subgraphs. The merging process\\ninto the original graph is iteratively optimized to resolve any arising\\nconflicts. We employ a hierarchical framework that integrates feedback\\ncorrection and conflict resolution to achieve $k$-coloring of arbitrary graph\\nvertices. Through experimental analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of\\nthe algorithm, highlighting the rapid convergence of conflict evolution and the\\nfact that iterative optimization allows the classical algorithm to approximate\\nthe number of colorings. Finally, we apply the proposed algorithm to optimize\\nthe scheduling of a subway transportation network, demonstrating a high degree\\nof fairness.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T05:45:15Z\"}"}
