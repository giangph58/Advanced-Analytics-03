This approach mixes temporal and spatial\\ncorrelations in a manner distinct from traditional metrology, leading to\\nambiguities in how one identifies Heisenberg scalings (e.g.~standard asymptotic\\nmetrics like the sensitivity are not bounded by system size). Here, we propose\\na new metric for continuous sensing, the optimized finite-time environmental\\nquantum Fisher information (QFI), that remedies the above issues by\\nsimultaneously treating time and system size as finite resources. In addition\\nto having direct experimental relevance, this quantity is rigorously bounded by\\nboth system size and integration time, allowing for a precise formulation of\\nHeisenberg scaling. We also introduce two many-body continuous sensors: the\\nhigh-temperature superradiant sensor, and the dissipative spin squeezer. Both\\nexhibit Heisenberg scaling of a collective magnetic field for multiple\\ndirections. The spin squeezed sensor has a striking advantage over previously\\nstudied many-body continuous sensors: the optimal measurement achieving the\\nfull QFI does not require the construction of a complex decoder system, but can\\nbe achieved using direct photodetection of the cavity output field.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T17:32:56Z\"}"}
