{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19613v1\", \"title\": \"Automatic Configuration Protocols for Optical Quantum Networks\", \"summary\": \"Before quantum networks can scale up to practical sizes, there are many\\ndeployment and configuration tasks that must be automated. Currently, quantum\\nnetworking testbeds are largely manually configured: network nodes are\\nconstructed out of a combination of free-space and fiber optics before being\\nconnected to shared single-photon detectors, time-to-digital converters, and\\noptical switches. Information about these connections must be tracked manually;\\nmislabeling may result in experimental failure and protracted debugging\\nsessions. In this paper, we propose protocols and algorithms to automate two\\nsuch manual processes. First, we address the problem of automatically\\nidentifying connections between quantum network nodes and time-to-digital\\nconverters. Then, we turn to the more complex challenge of identifying the\\nnodes attached to a quantum network's optical switches. Implementation of these\\nprotocols will help enable the development of other protocols necessary for\\nquantum networks, such as network topology discovery, link quality monitoring,\\nresource naming, and routing. We intend for this paper to serve as a roadmap\\nfor near-term implementation.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.NI,C.2.2\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T09:20:05Z\"}"}
