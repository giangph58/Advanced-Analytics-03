{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10007v1\", \"title\": \"Balancing Two Classifiers via A Simplex ETF Structure for Model\\n  Calibration\", \"summary\": \"In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated\\nstate-of-the-art performance across various domains. However, despite their\\nsuccess, they often face calibration issues, particularly in safety-critical\\napplications such as autonomous driving and healthcare, where unreliable\\npredictions can have serious consequences. Recent research has started to\\nimprove model calibration from the view of the classifier. However, the\\nexploration of designing the classifier to solve the model calibration problem\\nis insufficient. Let alone most of the existing methods ignore the calibration\\nerrors arising from underconfidence. In this work, we propose a novel method by\\nbalancing learnable and ETF classifiers to solve the overconfidence or\\nunderconfidence problem for model Calibration named BalCAL. By introducing a\\nconfidence-tunable module and a dynamic adjustment method, we ensure better\\nalignment between model confidence and its true accuracy. Extensive\\nexperimental validation shows that ours significantly improves model\\ncalibration performance while maintaining high predictive accuracy,\\noutperforming existing techniques. This provides a novel solution to the\\ncalibration challenges commonly encountered in deep learning.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:09:01Z\"}"}
