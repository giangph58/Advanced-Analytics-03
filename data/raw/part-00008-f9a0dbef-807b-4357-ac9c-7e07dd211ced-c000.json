{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12664v1\", \"title\": \"Autonomous Drone for Dynamic Smoke Plume Tracking\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents a novel autonomous drone-based smoke plume tracking\\nsystem capable of navigating and tracking plumes in highly unsteady atmospheric\\nconditions. The system integrates advanced hardware and software and a\\ncomprehensive simulation environment to ensure robust performance in controlled\\nand real-world settings. The quadrotor, equipped with a high-resolution imaging\\nsystem and an advanced onboard computing unit, performs precise maneuvers while\\naccurately detecting and tracking dynamic smoke plumes under fluctuating\\nconditions. Our software implements a two-phase flight operation, i.e.,\\ndescending into the smoke plume upon detection and continuously monitoring the\\nsmoke movement during in-plume tracking. Leveraging Proportional\\nIntegral-Derivative (PID) control and a Proximal Policy Optimization based Deep\\nReinforcement Learning (DRL) controller enables adaptation to plume dynamics.\\nUnreal Engine simulation evaluates performance under various smoke-wind\\nscenarios, from steady flow to complex, unsteady fluctuations, showing that\\nwhile the PID controller performs adequately in simpler scenarios, the\\nDRL-based controller excels in more challenging environments. Field tests\\ncorroborate these findings. This system opens new possibilities for drone-based\\nmonitoring in areas like wildfire management and air quality assessment. The\\nsuccessful integration of DRL for real-time decision-making advances autonomous\\ndrone control for dynamic environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T05:50:15Z\"}"}
