In this work, for the\\nparadigmatic Ising spin chain with transverse and longitudinal fields, we\\npresent numerical observations of several \\\"fine-grained\\\" features of\\nfar-from-equilibrium dynamics, induced by quantum quenches across the Ising\\ncritical point, from a quantum informational point of view that have hitherto\\nescaped notice. Rather featureless dynamics is seen for ferromagnetic to\\nparamagnetic quenches, but paramagnetic to ferromagnetic quenches exhibit rich\\nbehaviour, including a series of sudden deaths and revivals of entanglement\\nbetween two spins in the system's bulk, periodic but short-lived occurrences of\\napproximately $1-$uniform states, non-analytic cusps in single-copy\\nentanglement entropy for sufficiently big subsystems, insufficient mixedness\\nand a series of scrambling-$\\\\textit{un}$scrambling of local information between\\nneighboring spins. Moreover, essentially indistinguishable dynamics is seen at\\nvery early times between the integrable limit (zero longitudinal field) and\\nnon-integrable cases, with the former eventually showing signatures of better\\nmixing and faster approach to equilibration than the latter. These features are\\nexpected to hold for quench dynamics across Ising quantum critical points in\\nmore complicated systems.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.quant-gas,cond-mat.stat-mech,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T16:19:17Z\"}"}
