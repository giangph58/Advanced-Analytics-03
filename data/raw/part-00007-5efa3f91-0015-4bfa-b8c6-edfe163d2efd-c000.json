{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07708v1\", \"title\": \"TOCALib: Optimal control library with interpolation for bimanual\\n  manipulation and obstacles avoidance\", \"summary\": \"The paper presents a new approach for constructing a library of optimal\\ntrajectories for two robotic manipulators, Two-Arm Optimal Control and\\nAvoidance Library (TOCALib). The optimisation takes into account kinodynamic\\nand other constraints within the FROST framework. The novelty of the method\\nlies in the consideration of collisions using the DCOL method, which allows\\nobtaining symbolic expressions for assessing the presence of collisions and\\nusing them in gradient-based optimization control methods. The proposed\\napproach allowed the implementation of complex bimanual manipulations. In this\\npaper we used Mobile Aloha as an example of TOCALib application. The approach\\ncan be extended to other bimanual robots, as well as to gait control of bipedal\\nrobots. It can also be used to construct training data for machine learning\\ntasks for manipulation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T12:53:01Z\"}"}
