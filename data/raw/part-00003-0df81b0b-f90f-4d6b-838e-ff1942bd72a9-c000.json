{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12905v1\", \"title\": \"Second-order Optimization of Gaussian Splats with Importance Sampling\", \"summary\": \"3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is widely used for novel view synthesis due to\\nits high rendering quality and fast inference time. However, 3DGS predominantly\\nrelies on first-order optimizers such as Adam, which leads to long training\\ntimes. To address this limitation, we propose a novel second-order optimization\\nstrategy based on Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) and Conjugate Gradient (CG), which\\nwe specifically tailor towards Gaussian Splatting. Our key insight is that the\\nJacobian in 3DGS exhibits significant sparsity since each Gaussian affects only\\na limited number of pixels. We exploit this sparsity by proposing a matrix-free\\nand GPU-parallelized LM optimization. To further improve its efficiency, we\\npropose sampling strategies for both the camera views and loss function and,\\nconsequently, the normal equation, significantly reducing the computational\\ncomplexity. In addition, we increase the convergence rate of the second-order\\napproximation by introducing an effective heuristic to determine the learning\\nrate that avoids the expensive computation cost of line search methods. As a\\nresult, our method achieves a $3\\\\times$ speedup over standard LM and\\noutperforms Adam by $~6\\\\times$ when the Gaussian count is low while remaining\\ncompetitive for moderate counts.
