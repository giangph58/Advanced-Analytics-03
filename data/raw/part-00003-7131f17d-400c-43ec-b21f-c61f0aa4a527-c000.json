At each time $k$, the walker's step size is\\n$k^{-\\\\gamma}$ with $\\\\gamma>0$. We investigate effects of the step size exponent\\n$\\\\gamma$ and the memory parameter $\\\\alpha\\\\in [-1,1]$ on the long-time behavior\\nof the walker. For fixed $\\\\alpha$, it admits phase transition from divergence\\nto convergence (localization) at $\\\\gamma_{c}(\\\\alpha)=\\\\max \\\\{\\\\alpha,1/2\\\\}$. This\\nmeans that large enough memory effect can shift the critical point for\\nlocalization. Moreover, we obtain quantitative limit theorems which provide a\\ndetailed picture of the long-time behavior of the walker.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T03:57:55Z\"}"}
