{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12797v1\", \"title\": \"Status of the Proton EDM Experiment (pEDM)\", \"summary\": \"The Proton EDM Experiment (pEDM) is the first direct search for the proton\\nelectric dipole moment (EDM) with the aim of being the first experiment to\\nprobe the Standard Model (SM) prediction of any particle EDM. Phase-I of pEDM\\nwill achieve $10^{-29} e\\\\cdot$cm, improving current indirect limits by four\\norders of magnitude. This will establish a new standard of precision in nucleon\\nEDM searches and offer a unique sensitivity to better understand the Strong CP\\nproblem. The experiment is ideally positioned to explore physics beyond the\\nStandard Model (BSM), with sensitivity to axionic dark matter via the signal of\\nan oscillating proton EDM and across a wide mass range of BSM models from\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}(1\\\\text{GeV})$ to $\\\\mathcal{O}(10^3\\\\text{TeV})$. Utilizing the\\nfrozen-spin technique in a highly symmetric storage ring that leverages\\nexisting infrastructure at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), pEDM builds\\nupon the technological foundation and experimental expertise of the highly\\nsuccessful Muon $g$$-$$2$ Experiments. With significant R\\\\&D and prototyping\\nalready underway, pEDM is preparing a conceptual design report (CDR) to offer a\\ncost-effective, high-impact path to discovering new sources of CP violation and\\nadvancing our understanding of fundamental physics. It will play a vital role\\nin complementing the physics goals of the next-generation collider while\\nsimultaneously contributing to sustaining particle physics research and\\ntraining early career researchers during gaps between major collider\\noperations.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T09:59:22Z\"}"}
