Reliable short-term forecasts may be obtained by\\ncombining a Generalized Additive Models (GAM) with a State-Space model (Obst et\\nal., 2021), leading to an adaptive (or online) model. A GAM is an\\nover-parameterized linear model defined by a formula and a state-space model\\ninvolves hyperparameters. Both the formula and adaptation parameters have to be\\nfixed before model training and have a huge impact on the model's predictive\\nperformance. We propose optimizing them using the DRAGON package of Keisler\\n(2025), originally designed for neural architecture search. This work\\ngeneralizes it for automated online generalized additive model selection by\\ndefining an efficient modeling of the search space (namely, the space of the\\nGAM formulae and adaptation parameters). Its application to short-term French\\nelectricity demand forecasting demonstrates the relevance of the approach\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ML\", \"categories\": \"stat.ML,cs.LG,stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T12:46:33Z\"}"}
