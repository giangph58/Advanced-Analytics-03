{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19491v1\", \"title\": \"Self-testing of Nonmaximal Genuine Entangled States using Tripartite\\n  Hardy Relations\", \"summary\": \"We demonstrate that, in the tripartite scenario with all parties' local\\nevents being space-like separated, Hardy-type nonlocality constitutes a\\nstronger manifestation of nonlocal correlations than those captured by\\nMermin-type inequalities, an important distinction that has hitherto remained\\nunrecognised. To substantiate this assertion, we develop a general framework\\nfor the characterisation of tripartite correlations by extending the notion of\\nSettings Independence and Outcome Independence beyond their bipartite\\nformulation. This framework highlights the pivotal role of Hardy-type reasoning\\nin the detection and certification of genuine multipartite nonlocality.\\nFurthermore, we show that the tripartite Hardy-nonlocality enables the\\nself-testing of a broad class of pure nonmaximally genuine entangled tripartite\\nstates. A key advantage of Hardy-based self-testing over methods based on\\ntripartite Bell inequalities is its ability to certify quantum correlations\\neven in the presence of nonmaximal violations. This, in turn, facilitates the\\ndevice-independent certification of randomness from Hardy-type correlations.\\nUnlike Bell functionals, which typically enable self-testing of only a single\\nextremal point per inequality, Hardy relation self-tests a set of extremal\\nquantum correlations for any nonzero Hardy probability. We find that the\\nmaximum certifiable randomness using Hardy-type correlations is $\\\\log_2\\n7\\\\approx 2.8073$-bits, highlighting both the practical and foundational\\nsignificance of Hardy-based techniques for quantum randomness generation.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T05:15:40Z\"}"}
