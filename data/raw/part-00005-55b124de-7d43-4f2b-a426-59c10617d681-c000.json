Time, frequency, and amplitude\\ndistortions are modeled as smooth, invertible deformations, parameterized by\\nscalar fields and applied via exponential maps. A neural network is trained to\\ninfer these fields from synthetic distortions of typical speech-without using\\nany pathological data. At test time, the model applies an approximate inverse\\nto real dysarthric inputs. Despite zero-shot generalization, we observe\\nsubstantial ASR gains, including up to 16 percentage points WER reduction on\\nchallenging TORGO samples, with no degradation on clean speech. This work\\nintroduces a principled, interpretable approach for robust speech recognition\\nunder motor speech disorders\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SD\", \"categories\": \"cs.SD,cs.CL,cs.LG,eess.AS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T17:41:19Z\"}"}
