{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16851v1\", \"title\": \"Hyperspectral Vision Transformers for Greenhouse Gas Estimations from\\n  Space\", \"summary\": \"Hyperspectral imaging provides detailed spectral information and holds\\nsignificant potential for monitoring of greenhouse gases (GHGs). However, its\\napplication is constrained by limited spatial coverage and infrequent revisit\\ntimes. In contrast, multispectral imaging offers broader spatial and temporal\\ncoverage but often lacks the spectral detail that can enhance GHG detection. To\\naddress these challenges, this study proposes a spectral transformer model that\\nsynthesizes hyperspectral data from multispectral inputs. The model is\\npre-trained via a band-wise masked autoencoder and subsequently fine-tuned on\\nspatio-temporally aligned multispectral-hyperspectral image pairs. The\\nresulting synthetic hyperspectral data retain the spatial and temporal benefits\\nof multispectral imagery and improve GHG prediction accuracy relative to using\\nmultispectral data alone. This approach effectively bridges the trade-off\\nbetween spectral resolution and coverage, highlighting its potential to advance\\natmospheric monitoring by combining the strengths of hyperspectral and\\nmultispectral systems with self-supervised deep learning.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T16:19:42Z\"}"}
