To study this experimental observable,\\nwe describe three approaches involving numerical and analytical calculations.\\nWe first approach this problem by conducting model studies using EPOS,\\nFTFP$_{BERT}$, and HIJING, and notice that while EPOS shows a decreasing trend\\nof this ratio for increasing rapidity, the latter two model calculations\\ndisplay an increment of the ratio. The analytical approaches involve, first,\\nthe quasi-exponential distribution obtained from the Tsallis statistics, and\\nsecond, the nonadditive Boltzmann transport equation in the relaxation time\\napproximation. We notice that our analytical results satisfactorily describe\\nNA61 experimental data (for $\\\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=6.3, 7.6, 8.8, 12.3, and 17.3 GeV)\\nfor the negatively charged pions.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,hep-ex,hep-ph,nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T12:57:03Z\"}"}
