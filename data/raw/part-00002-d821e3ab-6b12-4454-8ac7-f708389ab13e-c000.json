{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01371v1\", \"title\": \"A simple schematic model for a cross section deficit in\\n  $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C fusion reactions\", \"summary\": \"A cross section deficit phenomenon has been observed in $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C\\nfusion reactions at astrophysical energies, at which fusion cross sections are\\nsuppressed in the off-resonance regions as compared to fusion cross sections\\nfor the $^{12}$C+$^{13}$C system. I here construct a simple schematic model\\nwhich simulates this phenomenon. The model consists of a random matrix\\nHamiltonian based on the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE), which is coupled\\nto an entrance channel Hamiltonian in the discrete basis representation. I show\\nthat the transmission coefficients are almost unity when both the level density\\nand the decay widths of the GOE configurations are large, realizing the strong\\nabsorption regime. On the other hand, when these parameters are small, the\\ntransmission coefficients are significantly structured as a function of energy.\\nIn that situation, the transmission coefficients at resonance energies reach\\nunity in this model, that is consistent with the experimental finding of the\\ncross section deficit.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T05:33:59Z\"}"}
