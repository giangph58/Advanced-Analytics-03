{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23941v1\", \"title\": \"Choco-Q: Commute Hamiltonian-based QAOA for Constrained Binary\\n  Optimization\", \"summary\": \"Constrained binary optimization aims to find an optimal assignment to\\nminimize or maximize the objective meanwhile satisfying the constraints, which\\nis a representative NP problem in various domains, including transportation,\\nscheduling, and economy. Quantum approximate optimization algorithms (QAOA)\\nprovide a promising methodology for solving this problem by exploiting the\\nparallelism of quantum entanglement. However, existing QAOA approaches based on\\npenalty-term or Hamiltonian simulation fail to thoroughly encode the\\nconstraints, leading to extremely low success rate and long searching latency.\\n  This paper proposes Choco-Q, a formal and universal framework for constrained\\nbinary optimization problems, which comprehensively covers all constraints and\\nexhibits high deployability for current quantum devices. The main innovation of\\nChoco-Q is to embed the commute Hamiltonian as the driver Hamiltonian,\\nresulting in a much more general encoding formulation that can deal with\\narbitrary linear constraints. Leveraging the arithmetic features of commute\\nHamiltonian, we propose three optimization techniques to squeeze the overall\\ncircuit complexity, including Hamiltonian serialization, equivalent\\ndecomposition, and variable elimination. The serialization mechanism transforms\\nthe original Hamiltonian into smaller ones. Our decomposition methods only take\\nlinear time complexity, achieving end-to-end acceleration. Experiments\\ndemonstrate that Choco-Q shows more than 235$\\\\times$ algorithmic improvement in\\nsuccessfully finding the optimal solution, and achieves 4.69$\\\\times$ end-to-end\\nacceleration, compared to prior QAOA designs.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T10:47:20Z\"}"}
