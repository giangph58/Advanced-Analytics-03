In this\\nwork, utilizing deep neural network based on Particle Transformer that relies\\non attention mechanism, we present a comprehensive analysis of the measurement\\nof the trilinear Higgs self-coupling through the Higgs pair production with\\nsubsequent decay into four $b$-quarks ($HH\\\\to b\\\\bar{b}b\\\\bar{b}$) at the LHC.\\nThe model processes full event-level information as input, bypassing explicit\\njet pairing and can serves as an event classifier. At HL-LHC, our approach\\nconstrains the $\\\\kappa_\\\\lambda$ to $(-0.53,6.01)$ at 68\\\\% CL achieving over\\n40\\\\% improvement in precision over conventional cut-based analyses. Comparison\\nagainst alternative machine learning architectures also shows the outstanding\\nperformance of the Transformer-based model, which is mainly due to its ability\\nto capture the correlations in the high-dimensional collision data with the\\nhelp of attention mechanism. The result highlights the potential of\\nattention-based networks in collider phenomenology.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T15:19:39Z\"}"}
