We focus on those contributions that emerge from a heavy scalar\\nsector that is linearly realized. In particular, we explore the decoupling\\nlimit of the aligned 2HDM. In this model, Barr-Zee diagrams with a fermion loop\\nproduce logarithmically-enhanced contributions that are proportional to\\npotentially large new sources of CP violation. In the decoupling limit these\\ncontributions are generated by effective dimension-6 operators via the mixing\\nof four-fermion operators into electroweak dipole operators. These logarithmic\\ncontributions are not present in more constrained versions of the 2HDM where a\\n$\\\\mathcal Z_2$ symmetry is imposed, which then controls the basis of effective\\noperators needed to describe the new physics contributions to the electron EDM.\\nThus, the $\\\\mathcal Z_2$ symmetry provides a suppression mechanism. We then\\nstudy how the experimental bounds on the electron EDM constrain the set of\\nparameters of the aligned 2HDM.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T13:29:11Z\"}"}
