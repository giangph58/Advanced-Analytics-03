In this model, each mutant child acquires a\\ntype different from that of its mother, chosen uniformly at random. In this\\nwork, we define a multitype allele tree associated with this model and analyze\\nits scaling limit through a Markov chain that tracks the sizes of allelic\\nsubfamilies and their mutant descendants. We show that this Markov chain\\nconverges to a continuous-state Markov process, whose transition probabilities\\ndepend on the sizes of the initial allelic populations and those of their\\nmutant offspring in the first allelic generation. As a result, the allele tree\\nconverges to a multidimensional limiting object, which can be described in\\nterms of the universal allele tree introduced by Bertoin (2010).\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:54:02Z\"}"}
