Peculiar to multi-field models, the\\nnoise-induced centrifugal force results in a longer duration of inflation\\ndepending on the number of fields, even when the stochastic noises themselves\\nare small. We show that, in such small-noise regimes, the number of fields\\ngenerically discriminates whether inflation successfully terminates or lasts\\nforever. Our results indicate that inflation with an extremely large number of\\nfields may fail to realise our observable Universe.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T13:05:11Z\"}"}
