{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11387v1\", \"title\": \"On the distribution of the telegraph meander and its properties\", \"summary\": \"In this paper we present the distribution of the telegraph meander, a random\\nfunction obtained by conditioning the telegraph process to stay above the zero\\nlevel. The reflection principle for finite-velocity random motions allows the\\nlaw of the telegraph meander to be expressed in terms of the spatial derivative\\nof the law of the telegraph process with initial negative velocity. As a\\nresult, we are able to obtain the characteristic function, the moments and the\\nhyperbolic equation that governs the law of the telegraph meander. Furthermore,\\nwe prove that Brownian meander is the weak limit of the telegraph meander.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:57:41Z\"}"}
