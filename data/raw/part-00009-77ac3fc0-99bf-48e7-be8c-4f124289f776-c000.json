Cosmological analyses based\\non galaxy cluster number counts have traditionally relied on explicitly\\ncomputed likelihoods, which are often challenging to develop with the required\\naccuracy and expensive to evaluate. In this work, we implement an alternative\\napproach based on simulation-based inference (SBI) methods that relies solely\\non synthetic galaxy cluster catalogues generated under a given model. These\\ncatalogues are much easier to produce than it is to develop and validate a\\nlikelihood. We validate this approach in the context of the galaxy cluster\\nsurvey of the upcoming Simons Observatory for a setup in which we can also\\nevaluate an exact explicit likelihood. We find that our SBI-based approach\\nyields cosmological parameter posterior means that are within $0.2\\\\,\\\\sigma$ of\\nthose obtained with the explicit likelihood and with biases smaller than\\n$0.1\\\\,\\\\sigma$. We also introduce and validate a procedure to assess the\\ngoodness of fit using only synthetic catalogues similar to those used for\\ntraining. This demonstrates, for the first time, that a galaxy cluster number\\ncount cosmological analysis can be performed fully without resorting to a\\nlikelihood at any stage. Finally, we apply our SBI-based approach to the real\\nPlanck MMF3 cosmology sample, obtaining cosmological parameter constraints that\\nare within $0.1\\\\,\\\\sigma$ of their likelihood-based counterparts. This\\nconstitutes the first SBI-based number count cosmological analysis of a real\\ngalaxy cluster catalogue.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T13:51:55Z\"}"}
