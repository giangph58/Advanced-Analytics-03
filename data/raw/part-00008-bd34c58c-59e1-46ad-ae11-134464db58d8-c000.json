{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21767v1\", \"title\": \"Whleaper: A 10-DOF Flexible Bipedal Wheeled Robot\", \"summary\": \"Wheel-legged robots combine the advantages of both wheeled robots and legged\\nrobots, offering versatile locomotion capabilities with excellent stability on\\nchallenging terrains and high efficiency on flat surfaces. However, existing\\nwheel-legged robots typically have limited hip joint mobility compared to\\nhumans, while hip joint plays a crucial role in locomotion. In this paper, we\\nintroduce Whleaper, a novel 10-degree-of-freedom (DOF) bipedal wheeled robot,\\nwith 3 DOFs at the hip of each leg. Its humanoid joint design enables adaptable\\nmotion in complex scenarios, ensuring stability and flexibility. This paper\\nintroduces the details of Whleaper, with a focus on innovative mechanical\\ndesign, control algorithms and system implementation. Firstly, stability stems\\nfrom the increased DOFs at the hip, which expand the range of possible postures\\nand improve the robot's foot-ground contact. Secondly, the extra DOFs also\\naugment its mobility. During walking or sliding, more complex movements can be\\nadopted to execute obstacle avoidance tasks. Thirdly, we utilize two control\\nalgorithms to implement multimodal motion for walking and sliding. By\\ncontrolling specific DOFs of the robot, we conducted a series of simulations\\nand practical experiments, demonstrating that a high-DOF hip joint design can\\neffectively enhance the stability and flexibility of wheel-legged robots.\\nWhleaper shows its capability to perform actions such as squatting, obstacle\\navoidance sliding, and rapid turning in real-world scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T16:07:44Z\"}"}
