{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02644v1\", \"title\": \"Solving the Paint Shop Problem with Flexible Management of Multi-Lane\\n  Buffers Using Reinforcement Learning and Action Masking\", \"summary\": \"In the paint shop problem, an unordered incoming sequence of cars assigned to\\ndifferent colors has to be reshuffled with the objective of minimizing the\\nnumber of color changes. To reshuffle the incoming sequence, manufacturers can\\nemploy a first-in-first-out multi-lane buffer system allowing store and\\nretrieve operations. So far, prior studies primarily focused on simple decision\\nheuristics like greedy or simplified problem variants that do not allow full\\nflexibility when performing store and retrieve operations. In this study, we\\npropose a reinforcement learning approach to minimize color changes for the\\nflexible problem variant, where store and retrieve operations can be performed\\nin an arbitrary order. After proving that greedy retrieval is optimal, we\\nincorporate this finding into the model using action masking. Our evaluation,\\nbased on 170 problem instances with 2-8 buffer lanes and 5-15 colors, shows\\nthat our approach reduces color changes compared to existing methods by\\nconsiderable margins depending on the problem size. Furthermore, we demonstrate\\nthe robustness of our approach towards different buffer sizes and imbalanced\\ncolor distributions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:37:40Z\"}"}
