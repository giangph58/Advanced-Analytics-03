{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02627v1\", \"title\": \"Incorporating the ChEES Criterion into Sequential Monte Carlo Samplers\", \"summary\": \"Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are a powerful but computationally\\nexpensive way of performing non-parametric Bayesian inference. MCMC proposals\\nwhich utilise gradients, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), can better\\nexplore the parameter space of interest if the additional hyper-parameters are\\nchosen well. The No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) is a variant of HMC which is\\nextremely effective at selecting these hyper-parameters but is slow to run and\\nis not suited to GPU architectures. An alternative to NUTS, Change in the\\nEstimator of the Expected Square HMC (ChEES-HMC) was shown not only to run\\nfaster than NUTS on GPU but also sample from posteriors more efficiently.\\nSequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers are another sampling method which instead\\noutput weighted samples from the posterior. They are very amenable to\\nparallelisation and therefore being run on GPUs while having additional\\nflexibility in their choice of proposal over MCMC. We incorporate (ChEEs-HMC)\\nas a proposal into SMC samplers and demonstrate competitive but faster\\nperformance than NUTS on a number of tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.CO\", \"categories\": \"stat.CO,cs.LG,cs.SY,eess.SY,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:25:19Z\"}"}
