While the diffusion model allows for high-quality\\nmotion generation, its computational cost is too expensive to control a robot\\nin real time. To achieve high quality and efficiency simultaneously, our\\none-step diffusion model takes an approximately generated motion, which is\\npredicted directly from input images. This approximate motion is optimized by\\nadditive noise provided by our novel noise optimizer. Unlike general isotropic\\nnoise, our noise optimizer adjusts noise anisotropically depending on the\\nuncertainty of each motion element. Our experimental results demonstrate that\\nour method outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining its\\nefficiency by one-step diffusion.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T10:10:17Z\"}"}
