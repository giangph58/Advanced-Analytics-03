When $(X,B)$ is Calabi-Yau, we show that its\\nBott-Chern complexity is non-negative. We prove that the Bott-Chern complexity\\nof a Calabi-Yau compact K\\\\\\\"ahler pair $(X,B)$ is at least three whenever $X$ is\\nnot projective. Furthermore, we show this value is optimal and is achieved by\\ncertain singular non-projective K3 surfaces.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG,math.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T10:20:57Z\"}"}
