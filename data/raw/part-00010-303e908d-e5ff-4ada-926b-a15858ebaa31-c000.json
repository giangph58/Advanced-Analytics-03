Second, we\\nconsider its generalization to the setting of area preserving diffeomorphisms\\nof the annulus. In both cases, we show how the problem can be linked to\\npermutohedra, majorization, and to gradient flows with respect to a suitable\\nmetric.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T13:15:26Z\"}"}
