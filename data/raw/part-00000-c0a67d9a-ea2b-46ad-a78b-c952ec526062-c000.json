Although biomedical research benefits from extensive datasets\\nand established benchmarks, agrochemical data remain scarce, particularly with\\nrespect to species-specific toxicity. This work focuses on ApisTox, the most\\ncomprehensive dataset of experimentally validated chemical toxicity to the\\nhoney bee (\\\\textit{Apis mellifera}), an ecologically vital pollinator. We\\nevaluate ApisTox using a diverse suite of machine learning approaches,\\nincluding molecular fingerprints, graph kernels, and graph neural networks, as\\nwell as pretrained models. Comparative analysis with medicinal datasets from\\nthe MoleculeNet benchmark reveals that ApisTox represents a distinct chemical\\nspace. Performance degradation on non-medicinal datasets, such as ApisTox,\\ndemonstrates their limited generalizability of current state-of-the-art\\nalgorithms trained solely on biomedical data. Our study highlights the need for\\nmore diverse datasets and for targeted model development geared toward the\\nagrochemical domain.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:51:12Z\"}"}
