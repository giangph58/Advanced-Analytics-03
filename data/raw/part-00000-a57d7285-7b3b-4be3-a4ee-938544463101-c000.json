{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21766v1\", \"title\": \"Stable-SCore: A Stable Registration-based Framework for 3D Shape\\n  Correspondence\", \"summary\": \"Establishing character shape correspondence is a critical and fundamental\\ntask in computer vision and graphics, with diverse applications including\\nre-topology, attribute transfer, and shape interpolation. Current dominant\\nfunctional map methods, while effective in controlled scenarios, struggle in\\nreal situations with more complex challenges such as non-isometric shape\\ndiscrepancies. In response, we revisit registration-for-correspondence methods\\nand tap their potential for more stable shape correspondence estimation. To\\novercome their common issues including unstable deformations and the necessity\\nfor careful pre-alignment or high-quality initial 3D correspondences, we\\nintroduce Stable-SCore: A Stable Registration-based Framework for 3D Shape\\nCorrespondence. We first re-purpose a foundation model for 2D character\\ncorrespondence that ensures reliable and stable 2D mappings. Crucially, we\\npropose a novel Semantic Flow Guided Registration approach that leverages 2D\\ncorrespondence to guide mesh deformations. Our framework significantly\\nsurpasses existing methods in challenging scenarios, and brings possibilities\\nfor a wide array of real applications, as demonstrated in our results.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:59:02Z\"}"}
