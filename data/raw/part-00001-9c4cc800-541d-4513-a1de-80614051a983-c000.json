The spectra reveal several features around the\\ntransition-frequencies between adjacent Rydberg states. We argue that some of\\nthese features are indicative of variations in the Rydberg excitation\\nprobability while others result from the removal of atoms from the cold cloud\\nas a consequence of a MW induced strong dipole-dipole inter-atomic force. Our\\nclaim is supported by experimental observations and theoretical modeling.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T17:06:05Z\"}"}
