{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15731v1\", \"title\": \"Entropy Stabilized ZrHfCoNiSnSb Half-Heusler Alloy for Thermoelectric\\n  Applications: A Theoretical Prediction\", \"summary\": \"Half-Heusler (HH) alloys are potential thermoelectric materials for use at\\nelevated temperatures due to their high Seebeck coefficient and superior\\nmechanical and thermal stability. However, their enhanced lattice thermal\\nconductivity is detrimental to thermoelectric applications. One way to\\ncircumvent this problem is to introduce mass disorder at lattice sites by\\nmixing the components of two or more alloys. Such systems are typically\\nstabilized by the entropy of mixing. In this work, using computational tools,\\nwe propose a mixed HH, namely, ZrHfCoNiSnSb, which can be formed by the\\nelemental compositions of the parent half-Heuslers ZrNiSn/HfNiSn and\\nHfCoSb/ZrCoSb. We propose that this new compound can be synthesized at elevated\\ntemperatures, as its Gibbs free energy is reduced due to higher configurational\\nentropy, making it more thermodynamically stable than the parent compounds\\nunder such conditions. Our calculations indicate that it is a dynamically\\nstable semiconductor with a band gap of 0.61 eV. Its lattice thermal\\nconductivity at room temperature is $5.39~\\\\text{Wm}^{-1}\\\\text{K}^{-1}$, which\\nis significantly lower than those of the parent compounds. The peak value of\\nthis alloy's figure of merit (ZT) is 1.00 for the n-type carriers at 1100 K,\\nwhich is 27% more than the best figure of merit obtained for the parent\\ncompounds.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T09:25:06Z\"}"}
