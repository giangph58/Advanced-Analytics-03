{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05300v1\", \"title\": \"Dimension-Free Convergence of Diffusion Models for Approximate Gaussian\\n  Mixtures\", \"summary\": \"Diffusion models are distinguished by their exceptional generative\\nperformance, particularly in producing high-quality samples through iterative\\ndenoising. While current theory suggests that the number of denoising steps\\nrequired for accurate sample generation should scale linearly with data\\ndimension, this does not reflect the practical efficiency of widely used\\nalgorithms like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). This paper\\ninvestigates the effectiveness of diffusion models in sampling from complex\\nhigh-dimensional distributions that can be well-approximated by Gaussian\\nMixture Models (GMMs). For these distributions, our main result shows that DDPM\\ntakes at most $\\\\widetilde{O}(1/\\\\varepsilon)$ iterations to attain an\\n$\\\\varepsilon$-accurate distribution in total variation (TV) distance,\\nindependent of both the ambient dimension $d$ and the number of components $K$,\\nup to logarithmic factors. Furthermore, this result remains robust to score\\nestimation errors. These findings highlight the remarkable effectiveness of\\ndiffusion models in high-dimensional settings given the universal approximation\\ncapability of GMMs, and provide theoretical insights into their practical\\nsuccess.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.NA,math.NA,math.ST,stat.ML,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T17:59:07Z\"}"}
