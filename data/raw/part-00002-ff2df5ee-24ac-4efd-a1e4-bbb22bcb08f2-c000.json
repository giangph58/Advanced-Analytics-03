{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16771v1\", \"title\": \"Projective Variety Recovery from Unknown Linear Projections\", \"summary\": \"We study how a smooth irreducible algebraic variety $X$ of dimension $n$\\nembedded in $\\\\mathbb{C} \\\\mathbb{P}^{m}$ (with $m \\\\geq n+2$), which degree is\\n$d$, can be recovered using two projections from unknown points onto unknown\\nhyperplanes. The centers and the hyperplanes of projection are unknown: the\\nonly input is the defining equations of each projected varieties. We show how\\nboth the projection operators and the variety in $\\\\mathbb{C} \\\\mathbb{P}^{m}$\\ncan be recovered modulo some action of the group of projective transformations\\nof $\\\\mathbb{C} \\\\mathbb{P}^{m}$. This configuration generalizes results obtained\\nin the context of curves embedded in $\\\\mathbb{C} \\\\mathbb{P}^3$ and results\\nconcerning surfaces embedded in $\\\\mathbb{C} \\\\mathbb{P}^4$.\\n  We show how in a generic situation, a characteristic matrix of the pair of\\nprojections can be recovered. In the process we address dimensional issues and\\nas a result establish a necessary condition, as well as a sufficient condition\\nto compute this characteristic matrix up to a finite-fold ambiguity. These\\nconditions are expressed as minimal values of the degree of the dual variety.\\n  Then we use this matrix to recover the class of the couple of projections and\\nas a consequence to recover the variety. For a generic situation, two\\nprojections define a variety with two irreducible components. One component has\\ndegree $d(d-1)$ and the other has degree $d$, being the original variety.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG,cs.SC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T14:42:43Z\"}"}
