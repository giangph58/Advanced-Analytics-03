{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02777v1\", \"title\": \"Sharp connectivity bounds for the vacant set of random interlacements\", \"summary\": \"We consider percolation of the vacant set of random interlacements at\\nintensity $u$ in dimensions three and higher, and derive lower bounds on the\\ntruncated two-point function for all values of $u>0$. These bounds are sharp up\\nto principal exponential order for all $u$ in dimension three and all $u \\\\neq\\nu_\\\\ast$ in higher dimensions, where $u_*$ refers to the critical parameter of\\nthe model, and they match the upper bounds derived in the article\\narXiv:2503.14497. In dimension three, our results further imply that the\\ntruncated two-point function grows at large distances $x$ at a rate that\\ndepends on $x$ only through its Euclidean norm, which offers a glimpse of the\\nexpected (Euclidean) invariance of the scaling limit at criticality. The rate\\nfunction is atypical, it incurs a logarithmic correction and comes with an\\nexplicit pre-factor that converges to $0$ as the parameter $u$ approaches the\\ncritical point $u_*$ from either side. A particular challenge stems from the\\ncombined effects of lack of monotonicity due to the truncation in the\\nsuper-critical phase, and the precise (rotationally invariant) controls we\\nseek, that measure the effects of a certain \\\"harmonic humpback\\\" function. Among\\nothers, their derivation relies on rather fine estimates for hitting\\nprobabilities of the random walk in arbitrary direction $e$, which witness this\\ninvariance at the discrete level, and preclude straightforward applications of\\nprojection arguments.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T17:17:52Z\"}"}
