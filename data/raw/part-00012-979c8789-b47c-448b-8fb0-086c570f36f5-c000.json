{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13127v1\", \"title\": \"Force and Speed in a Soft Stewart Platform\", \"summary\": \"Many soft robots struggle to produce dynamic motions with fast, large\\ndisplacements. We develop a parallel 6 degree-of-freedom (DoF) Stewart-Gough\\nmechanism using Handed Shearing Auxetic (HSA) actuators. By using soft\\nactuators, we are able to use one third as many mechatronic components as a\\nrigid Stewart platform, while retaining a working payload of 2kg and an\\nopen-loop bandwidth greater than 16Hx. We show that the platform is capable of\\nboth precise tracing and dynamic disturbance rejection when controlling a ball\\nand sliding puck using a Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller. We\\ndevelop a machine-learning-based kinematics model and demonstrate a functional\\nworkspace of roughly 10cm in each translation direction and 28 degrees in each\\norientation. This 6DoF device has many of the characteristics associated with\\nrigid components - power, speed, and total workspace - while capturing the\\nadvantages of soft mechanisms.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:43:33Z\"}"}
