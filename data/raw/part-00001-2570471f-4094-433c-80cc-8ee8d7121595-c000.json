{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11111v1\", \"title\": \"S$^2$Teacher: Step-by-step Teacher for Sparsely Annotated Oriented\\n  Object Detection\", \"summary\": \"Although fully-supervised oriented object detection has made significant\\nprogress in multimodal remote sensing image understanding, it comes at the cost\\nof labor-intensive annotation. Recent studies have explored weakly and\\nsemi-supervised learning to alleviate this burden. However, these methods\\noverlook the difficulties posed by dense annotations in complex remote sensing\\nscenes. In this paper, we introduce a novel setting called sparsely annotated\\noriented object detection (SAOOD), which only labels partial instances, and\\npropose a solution to address its challenges. Specifically, we focus on two key\\nissues in the setting: (1) sparse labeling leading to overfitting on limited\\nforeground representations, and (2) unlabeled objects (false negatives)\\nconfusing feature learning. To this end, we propose the S$^2$Teacher, a novel\\nmethod that progressively mines pseudo-labels for unlabeled objects, from easy\\nto hard, to enhance foreground representations. Additionally, it reweights the\\nloss of unlabeled objects to mitigate their impact during training. Extensive\\nexperiments demonstrate that S$^2$Teacher not only significantly improves\\ndetector performance across different sparse annotation levels but also\\nachieves near-fully-supervised performance on the DOTA dataset with only 10%\\nannotation instances, effectively balancing detection accuracy with annotation\\nefficiency. The code will be public.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T11:57:00Z\"}"}
