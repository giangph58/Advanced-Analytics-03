{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01457v1\", \"title\": \"Deep LG-Track: An Enhanced Localization-Confidence-Guided Multi-Object\\n  Tracker\", \"summary\": \"Multi-object tracking plays a crucial role in various applications, such as\\nautonomous driving and security surveillance. This study introduces Deep\\nLG-Track, a novel multi-object tracker that incorporates three key enhancements\\nto improve the tracking accuracy and robustness. First, an adaptive Kalman\\nfilter is developed to dynamically update the covariance of measurement noise\\nbased on detection confidence and trajectory disappearance. Second, a novel\\ncost matrix is formulated to adaptively fuse motion and appearance information,\\nleveraging localization confidence and detection confidence as weighting\\nfactors. Third, a dynamic appearance feature updating strategy is introduced,\\nadjusting the relative weighting of historical and current appearance features\\nbased on appearance clarity and localization accuracy. Comprehensive\\nevaluations on the MOT17 and MOT20 datasets demonstrate that the proposed Deep\\nLG-Track consistently outperforms state-of-the-art trackers across multiple\\nperformance metrics, highlighting its effectiveness in multi-object tracking\\ntasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:10:18Z\"}"}
