Considering systems on the d-dimensional torus, we construct\\nappropriate space-discrete processes and show convergence not only on the level\\nof solutions, but also on the level of the gradient systems governing the\\nevolutions. As an important step, we prove chain rule inequalities for the\\nreaction-diffusion systems as well as their discretizations, featuring a\\nnon-convex dissipation functional. The convergence is then obtained with\\nvariational methods by building on the recently introduced notion of gradient\\nsystems in continuity equation format.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,cs.NA,math-ph,math.DS,math.MP,math.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T12:51:15Z\"}"}
