Such modifications are controlled by the\\nnotion of Topological QFT (TQFT) coupling across different codimensions.\\nMotivated by the recent developments involving non-compact TQFTs as the\\nSymmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) for continuous symmetries, we\\nexplore topological manipulations on global $\\\\mathbb{R}$ symmetries in the\\nsimple contexts of abelian gauge theories. We do so by turning on $\\\\mathbb{R}$\\nbackground fields in these models, which are then inserted into a BF theory\\nwith a conjugate field valued either in $\\\\mathbb{R}$ or $U(1)$, depending on\\nthe manipulation. When the conjugate field is $\\\\mathbb{R}$-valued, it gives a\\nflat gauging prescription of the $\\\\mathbb{R}$ global symmetry. For certain\\ncases, this gauging can be used to establish path-integral dualities, with\\nwhich one can construct topological duality defects and condensation defects.\\nThe defects being defined by employing self-duality under $\\\\mathbb{R}$ gauging,\\nthey are anticipated to obey a Tambara-Yamagami like fusion algebra. Due to the\\nchallenges arising from the non-compactness of $\\\\mathbb{R}$, we do not\\nrigorously establish this expectation. For the TQFT coupling with $U(1)$ valued\\nconjugate field, we demonstrate a $2\\\\pi \\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}$ subgroup\\ngauging, which we connect to the results obtained from SymTFT recently.\\nExecuting this gauging in the 2d real scalar and the 4d $\\\\mathbb{R}$ Maxwell,\\nwe respectively obtain the 2d compact scalar and the 4d $U(1)$ Maxwell theory.\\nFinally, we give an exposition on the $\\\\mathbb{R}$ gauging ideas applied to\\n$(-1)-$form and $(d-1)-$form $\\\\mathbb{R}$ symmetries. In particular, using the\\nSymTFT picture, we identify the possible manipulations and realize them\\nexplicitly in the context of $p$-form gauge theory in $d=p+1$ dimensions.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T17:19:42Z\"}"}
