Here we report the emergence of surface spin-wave\\nexcitations within the bulk magnon band gap of type-A van der Waals\\nantiferromagnets composed of antiferromagnetically coupled ferromagnetic\\nmonolayers. In contrast to the magnetostatic Damon-Eshbach modes in magnetic\\nslabs, these surface waves are pure exchange modes owing to the reduced\\ninterlayer exchange coupling at surface layers, and thus persist in ultrathin\\nmultilayer stacks and at large wave numbers. We show that they can be\\nefficiently excited by electromagnetic waves, with absorption power comparable\\nto or even exceeding that of bulk modes. Moreover, their magnetic stray fields\\nexhibit pronounced even-odd oscillations with the number of monolayers that\\nshould be observable by NV-center magnetometry.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T09:39:05Z\"}"}
