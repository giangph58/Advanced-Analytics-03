We show that, in\\nthe exact-WKB analysis, the quasi-energy and Floquet effective Hamiltonian can\\nbe expressed in terms of cycle integrals (Voros symbol), which characterize\\nmonodromy matrices for Schr\\\\\\\"odinger-type differential equations governing\\ntwo-level Floquet systems. We analytically evaluate the cycle integrals using\\nthe low-frequency expansion and derive both perturbative and non-perturbative\\ncorrections to the quasi-energy and Floquet effective Hamiltonian. To verify\\nthe accuracy of our results, we compare them with numerical calculations and\\nanalyze resonant oscillations, which reveal non-perturbative features that\\ncannot be captured by the perturbative expansion.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T10:53:52Z\"}"}
