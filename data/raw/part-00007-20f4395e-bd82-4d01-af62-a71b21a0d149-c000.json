Additionally, prior approaches yield\\ndivergent time scores near boundaries, leading to instability. We propose\\n$\\\\text{D}^3\\\\text{RE}$, a unified framework for robust and efficient density\\nratio estimation. It introduces the Dequantified Diffusion-Bridge Interpolant\\n(DDBI), which expands support coverage and stabilizes time scores via diffusion\\nbridges and Gaussian dequantization. Building on DDBI, the Dequantified\\nSchr\\\\\\\"odinger-Bridge Interpolant (DSBI) incorporates optimal transport to solve\\nthe Schr\\\\\\\"odinger bridge problem, enhancing accuracy and efficiency. Our method\\noffers uniform approximation and bounded time scores in theory, and outperforms\\nbaselines empirically in mutual information and density estimation tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T08:12:16Z\"}"}
