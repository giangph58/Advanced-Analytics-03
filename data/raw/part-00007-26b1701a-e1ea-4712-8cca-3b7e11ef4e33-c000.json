{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20962v1\", \"title\": \"A Novel Method of Modeling Extended Emission of Compact Jets:\\n  Application to Swift J1727.8-1613\", \"summary\": \"Flat radio spectra of compact jets launched by both supermassive and\\nstellar-mass black holes are explained by an interplay of self-absorbed\\nsynchrotron emission up to some distance along the jet and optically thin\\nsynchrotron at larger distances (Blandford & Konigl 1979). Their spatial\\nstructure is usually studied using core shifts, in which the position of the\\npeak (core) of the emission depends on the frequency. Here, we propose a novel\\nmethod to fit the spatial dependence of the flux density at a given frequency\\nof the jet and counterjet (when observed) using the theoretical spatial\\ndependencies, which we provide as simple analytical formulae. We apply our\\nmethod to the spatial structure of the jets in the luminous hard spectral state\\nof the black-hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8--1613. It was the most resolved\\ncontinuous jet from an X-ray binary ever observed. We find that the observed\\napproaching jet is significantly intrinsically stronger than the receding one,\\nwhich we attribute to an increase in the emission of both jets with time\\n(observationally confirmed), together with the light travel effect, causing the\\nreceding jet to be observed at an earlier epoch than the approaching one. The\\njets are relatively slow, with the velocity $\\\\sim(0.3$--$0.4)c$. Our findings\\nimply that the magnetic field strength increased with time. Also, the magnetic\\nflux is much lower than in jets launched by `Magnetically Arrested Disks'. Our\\nmethod is general, and we propose that it be applied to jets launched by\\nstellar-mass and supermassive black holes.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:32:38Z\"}"}
