Introduced and studied by Bergeron and Reutenauer,\\n$SL_k$-tilings generalize the notion of Conway-Coxeter frieze patterns in the\\ncase $k=2$. In a recent paper, Short showed a bijection between bi-infinite\\npaths of reduced rationals in the Farey graph and $SL_2$-tilings. We extend\\nthis result to higher $k$ by constructing a bijection between $SL_k$-tilings\\nand certain pairs of bi-infinite strips of vectors in $\\\\mathbb{Z}^k$ called\\npaths. The key ingredient in the proof is the connection to Pl\\\\\\\"ucker friezes\\nand Grassmannian cluster algebras. As an application, we obtain results about\\nperiodicity, duality, and positivity for tilings.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,math.RA,math.RT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:49:39Z\"}"}
