{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10180v1\", \"title\": \"ChartOptimiser: Task-driven Optimisation of Chart Designs\", \"summary\": \"Effective chart design is essential for satisfying viewers' information\\nneeds, such as retrieving values from a chart or comparing two values. However,\\ncreating effective charts is challenging and time-consuming due to the large\\ndesign space and the inter-dependencies between individual design parameters.\\nTo address this challenge, we propose ChartOptimiser -- a Bayesian approach for\\ntask-driven optimisation of charts, such as bar charts. At the core of\\nChartOptimiser is a novel objective function to automatically optimise an\\neight-dimensional design space combining four perceptual metrics: visual\\nsaliency, text legibility, colour preference, and white space ratio. Through\\nempirical evaluation on 12 bar charts and four common analytical tasks --\\nfinding the extreme value, retrieving a value, comparing two values, and\\ncomputing a derived value -- we show that ChartOptimiser outperforms existing\\ndesign baselines concerning task-solving ease, visual aesthetics, and chart\\nclarity. We also discuss two practical applications of ChartOptimiser:\\ngenerating charts for accessibility and content localisation. Taken together,\\nChartOptimiser opens up an exciting new research direction in automated chart\\ndesign where charts are optimised for users' information needs, preferences,\\nand contexts.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T12:34:03Z\"}"}
