Since\\nthe class of finitely generated shift-invariant spaces (FSISs) is popularly\\nused for modelling signals, we assume $\\\\mathcal{C}$ consists of FSISs. We will\\nbe considering three cases. In the first case, $\\\\mathcal{C}$ consists of FSISs\\nwithout any assumption on extra invariance. In the second case, we assume\\n$\\\\mathcal{C}$ consists of extra invariant FSISs, and in the third case, we\\nassume $\\\\mathcal{C}$ has translation-invariant FSISs. In all three cases, we\\nprove the existence of an optimal space.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:00:21Z\"}"}
