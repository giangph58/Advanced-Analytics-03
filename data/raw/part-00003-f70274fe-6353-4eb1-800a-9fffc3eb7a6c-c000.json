{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06869v1\", \"title\": \"Grouping Strategies on Two-Phase Methods for Bi-objective Combinatorial\\n  Optimization\", \"summary\": \"Two-phase methods are commonly used to solve bi-objective combinatorial\\noptimization problems. In the first phase, all extreme supported nondominated\\npoints are generated through a dichotomic search. This phase also allows the\\nidentification of search zones that may contain other nondominated points. The\\nsecond phase focuses on exploring these search zones to locate the remaining\\npoints, which typically accounts for most of the computational cost. Ranking\\nalgorithms are frequently employed to explore each zone individually, but this\\napproach leads to redundancies, causing multiple visits to the same solutions.\\nTo mitigate these redundancies, we propose several strategies that group\\nadjacent zones, allowing a single run of the ranking algorithm for the entire\\ngroup. Additionally, we explore an implicit grouping approach based on a new\\nconcept of coverage. Our experiments on the Bi-Objective Spanning Tree Problem\\ndemonstrate the beneficial impact of these grouping strategies when combined\\nwith coverage.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS,cs.DM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:19:26Z\"}"}
