We\\nestablish sharp asymptotics for the $N$-point correlation function of the\\nsystem. Our analysis relies on two precise tail estimates for the system\\ndensity, as well as the non-collision probability of $N$ independent random\\nwalks with arbitrary fixed initial configurations. In addition, we derive\\nrefined estimates for heavy-tailed random walks, which may be of independent\\ninterest.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T07:09:45Z\"}"}
