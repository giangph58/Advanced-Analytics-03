{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10461v1\", \"title\": \"Layered Multirate Control of Constrained Linear Systems\", \"summary\": \"Layered control architectures have been a standard paradigm for efficiently\\nmanaging complex constrained systems. A typical architecture consists of: i) a\\nhigher layer, where a low-frequency planner controls a simple model of the\\nsystem, and ii) a lower layer, where a high-frequency tracking controller\\nguides a detailed model of the system toward the output of the higher-layer\\nmodel. A fundamental problem in this layered architecture is the design of\\nplanners and tracking controllers that guarantee both higher- and lower-layer\\nsystem constraints are satisfied. Toward addressing this problem, we introduce\\na principled approach for layered multirate control of linear systems subject\\nto output and input constraints. Inspired by discrete-time simulation\\nfunctions, we propose a streamlined control design that guarantees the\\nlower-layer system tracks the output of the higher-layer system with computable\\nprecision. Using this design, we derive conditions and present a method for\\npropagating the constraints of the lower-layer system to the higher-layer\\nsystem. The propagated constraints are integrated into the design of an\\narbitrary planner that can handle higher-layer system constraints. Our\\nframework ensures that the output constraints of the lower-layer system are\\nsatisfied at all high-level time steps, while respecting its input constraints\\nat all low-level time steps. We apply our approach in a scenario of motion\\nplanning, highlighting its critical role in ensuring collision avoidance.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:48:34Z\"}"}
