Yet, their performance and\\nscalability often hinge on effective parameter optimization, which remains\\nnontrivial due to rugged energy landscapes and hardware noise. In this work, we\\nintroduce a quantum meta-learning framework that combines quantum neural\\nnetworks, specifically Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM) architectures,\\nwith QAOA. By training the QLSTM optimizer on smaller graph instances, our\\napproach rapidly generalizes to larger, more complex problems, substantially\\nreducing the number of iterations required for convergence. Through\\ncomprehensive benchmarks on Max-Cut and Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model\\ninstances, we demonstrate that QLSTM-based optimizers converge faster and\\nachieve higher approximation ratios compared to classical baselines, thereby\\noffering a robust pathway toward scalable quantum optimization in the NISQ era.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T14:39:26Z\"}"}
