However, in recent years, smart contract security\\nbreaches have occurred frequently, and due to their financial properties, they\\nhave caused huge economic losses, such as the most famous security incident\\n\\\"The DAO\\\" which caused a loss of over \\\\$60 million in Ethereum. This has drawn\\na lot of attention from all sides. Writing a secure smart contract is now a\\ncritical issue.This paper focuses on Ether smart contracts and explains the\\nmain components of Ether, smart contract architecture and mechanism.The\\nenvironment used in this paper is the Ethernet environment, using remix online\\ncompilation platform and Solidity language, according to the four security\\nevents of American Chain, The DAO, Parity and KotET, the principles of integer\\noverflow attack, reentrant attack, access control attack and denial of service\\nattack are studied and analyzed accordingly, and the scenarios of these\\nvulnerabilities are reproduced, and the measures to prevent them are given.\\nFinally, preventive measures are given. In addition, the principles of short\\naddress attack, early transaction attack and privileged function exposure\\nattack are also introduced in detail, and security measures are proposed.As\\nvulnerabilities continue to emerge, their classification will also evolve. The\\nanalysis and research of the current vulnerabilities are also to lay a solid\\nfoundation for avoiding more vulnerabilities.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,D.2.4\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:25:34Z\"}"}
