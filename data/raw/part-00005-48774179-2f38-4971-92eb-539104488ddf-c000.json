By deriving an explicit inversion formula, we relate variations in\\nentanglement entropy to deviations of the bulk metric about a fixed background.\\nApplying this formula, we recover the Schwarzschild-AdS spacetime in the\\nlow-temperature regime to first order. We further extend our analysis to\\ninclude deformations of the bulk geometry with nontrivial dependence on\\nboundary directions, and propose an iterative reconstruction scheme aimed at\\nrecovering the full spacetime starting close to a conformal fixed point. We do\\nthis by building on recent advances in the mathematics of inverse problems by\\nintroducing the higher-order linearization method as a new tool in the context\\nof holographic bulk reconstruction.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T16:32:15Z\"}"}
