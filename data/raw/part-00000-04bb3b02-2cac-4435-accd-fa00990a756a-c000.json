We show that, at saturation density, the\\nequation-of-state dependence of these transport quantities is fully determined\\nby the experimentally constrained nuclear symmetry energy $S$ and its slope\\n$L$. Variations of $L$ within current experimental uncertainties can change the\\n(frequency-independent) bulk viscosity by orders of magnitude. This suggests\\nthat dissipative effects encoded in the gravitational-wave signatures of binary\\nneutron star inspirals may help constrain nuclear symmetry energy properties.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:42:50Z\"}"}
