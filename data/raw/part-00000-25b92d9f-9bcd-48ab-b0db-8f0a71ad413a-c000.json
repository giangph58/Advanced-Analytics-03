Our analysis\\nconcentrates on the radiative decays of $\\\\eta$ and $\\\\eta'$ mesons, including\\n$\\\\eta^{(\\\\prime)} \\\\to \\\\gamma\\\\gamma$, $\\\\eta^{(\\\\prime)} \\\\to \\\\gamma\\\\ell^+ \\\\ell^-$,\\n$\\\\eta^{(\\\\prime)} \\\\to \\\\pi^+\\\\pi^-\\\\gamma$, and $\\\\eta^{(\\\\prime)} \\\\to\\n\\\\pi^+\\\\pi^-\\\\ell^+\\\\ell^-$, as well as semileptonic kaon decays such as $K^+ \\\\to\\n\\\\pi^+\\\\pi^- e^+ \\\\nu_e$. Employing the hidden local symmetry framework to\\nincorporate vector meson contributions, we compute the decay amplitudes and\\nform factors. For the decay $\\\\eta \\\\to \\\\pi^+\\\\pi^-\\\\gamma$, the box anomaly\\ndominates, and we find that the anomalous coupling can be experimentally\\ndetermined to percent-level precision at BESIII. In contrast, vector meson\\ncontributions are significant in the decay $\\\\eta' \\\\to \\\\pi^+\\\\pi^-\\\\gamma$. Using\\nexperimental data for $\\\\eta' \\\\to \\\\pi^+\\\\pi^-\\\\gamma$, we obtain ${\\\\cal\\nB}_{\\\\mathrm{box}}^{\\\\text{exp}} = (1.70 \\\\pm 0.05)\\\\%$, which is approximately ten\\ntimes larger than previously expected experimentally. We observe good agreement\\nbetween our calculated anomalous couplings and experimental results. In kaon\\ndecays, WZW terms uniquely contribute to the form factor $H$, which can be\\nextracted from parity-conserving decay distributions. While predictions at the\\nchiral point closely match experimental values (e.g., $H^+ = -2.31$ versus\\n$-2.27 \\\\pm 0.10$), we find that intermediate vector meson states introduce\\nsubstantial corrections, potentially as large as 25%. We strongly advocate for\\nrevisiting these experiments to achieve improved precision in form factor\\nextractions.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T09:14:32Z\"}"}
