The method\\nemploys a semi-Lagrangian discontinuous Galerkin scheme for spatial\\ndiscretization of the Vlasov equation, achieving high-order accuracy while\\nremoving the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) constraint. To ensure energy\\nconservation and eliminate the need to resolve the plasma period, we adopt an\\nenergy-conserving time discretization introduced by Liu et al. [J. Comput.\\nPhys., 492 (2023), 112412]. Temporal accuracy is further enhanced through a\\nhigh-order operator splitting strategy, yielding a method that is high-order\\naccurate in both space and time. The resulting ECSLDG scheme is unconditionally\\nstable and conserves both mass and energy at the fully discrete level,\\nregardless of spatial or temporal resolution. Numerical experiments demonstrate\\nthe accuracy, stability, and conservation properties of the proposed method. In\\nparticular, the method achieves more accurate enforcement of Gauss's law and\\nimproved numerical fidelity over low-order schemes, especially when using a\\nlarge CFL number.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:28:01Z\"}"}
