{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15606v1\", \"title\": \"Warm multi natural inflation\", \"summary\": \"Multi natural inflation is studied in the context of warm inflation. We study\\nthe warm multi natural inflation scenario with both linear and cubic\\ndissipation coefficients. The model is motivated by axion-like inflation models\\nwith coupling to non-Abelian gauge fields through a dimension five coupling and\\ndissipation originating from sphaleron decay in a thermal bath. Both cases of\\ndissipation coefficients can be compatible with current observations. In the\\ncase of the cubic dissipation coefficient, we find that the curvature\\nperturbation starts to grow suddenly when a transition from a weak dissipation\\nto a strong dissipation regime occurs at the later stage of the inflation. We\\nalso show that such rapid growth of the curvature perturbation on small scales\\ngives rise to abundant scalar induced gravitational waves, which may be\\ndetectable with future gravitational wave detectors such as DECIGO and ET. On\\nthe other hand, there are also other parameter regions of the model, in the\\nwarm inflation regime of weak to strong dissipation and with sub-Planckian\\naxion decay constant, that can lead to overproduction of primordial black holes\\non small scales, which are constrained by nucleosynthesis bounds, thus ruling\\nout the model in this region of parameters.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T05:54:47Z\"}"}
