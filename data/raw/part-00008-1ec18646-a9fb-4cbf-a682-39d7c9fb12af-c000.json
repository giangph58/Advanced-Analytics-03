{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02420v1\", \"title\": \"On learning racing policies with reinforcement learning\", \"summary\": \"Fully autonomous vehicles promise enhanced safety and efficiency. However,\\nensuring reliable operation in challenging corner cases requires control\\nalgorithms capable of performing at the vehicle limits. We address this\\nrequirement by considering the task of autonomous racing and propose solving it\\nby learning a racing policy using Reinforcement Learning (RL). Our approach\\nleverages domain randomization, actuator dynamics modeling, and policy\\narchitecture design to enable reliable and safe zero-shot deployment on a real\\nplatform. Evaluated on the F1TENTH race car, our RL policy not only surpasses a\\nstate-of-the-art Model Predictive Control (MPC), but, to the best of our\\nknowledge, also represents the first instance of an RL policy outperforming\\nexpert human drivers in RC racing. This work identifies the key factors driving\\nthis performance improvement, providing critical insights for the design of\\nrobust RL-based control strategies for autonomous vehicles.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T09:21:48Z\"}"}
