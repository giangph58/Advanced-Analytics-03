{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20410v1\", \"title\": \"Terahertz Wireless Data Center: Gaussian Beam or Airy Beam?\", \"summary\": \"Terahertz (THz) communication is emerging as a pivotal enabler for 6G and\\nbeyond wireless systems owing to its multi-GHz bandwidth. One of its novel\\napplications is in wireless data centers, where it enables ultra-high data\\nrates while enhancing network reconfigurability and scalability. However, due\\nto numerous racks, supporting walls, and densely deployed antennas, the\\nline-of-sight (LoS) path in data centers is often instead of fully obstructed,\\nresulting in quasi-LoS propagation and degradation of spectral efficiency. To\\naddress this issue, Airy beam-based hybrid beamforming is investigated in this\\npaper as a promising technique to mitigate quasi-LoS propagation and enhance\\nspectral efficiency in THz wireless data centers. Specifically, a cascaded\\ngeometrical and wave-based channel model (CGWCM) is proposed for quasi-LoS\\nscenarios, which accounts for diffraction effects while being more simplified\\nthan conventional wave-based model. Then, the characteristics and generation of\\nthe Airy beam are analyzed, and beam search methods for quasi-LoS scenarios are\\nproposed, including hierarchical focusing-Airy beam search, and low-complexity\\nbeam search. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the CGWCM and\\ndemonstrate the superiority of the Airy beam over Gaussian beams in mitigating\\nblockages, verifying its potential for practical THz wireless communication in\\ndata centers.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,eess.SP,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T04:15:52Z\"}"}
