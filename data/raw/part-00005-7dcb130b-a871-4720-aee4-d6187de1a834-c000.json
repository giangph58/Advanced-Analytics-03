{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05388v1\", \"title\": \"On the Multiangle Discrete Fractional Fourier Transform\", \"summary\": \"The efficiently computed multiangle centered discrete fractional Fourier\\ntransform (MA-CDFRFT) [1] has proven as a useful tool for time-frequency\\nanalysis; however, its scope is limited to the centered discrete fractional\\nFourier transform (CDFRFT). Meanwhile, extensive research on the standard DFRFT\\nhas lead to a better understanding of this transform as well as numerous\\npossible choices for eigenvectors for implementation. In this letter we present\\na simple adaptation of the MA-CDFRFT which allows us to efficiently compute its\\nstandard counterpart, which we call the multiangle DFRFT (MA-DFRFT).\\nFurthermore, we formalize the symmetries inherent to the MA-CDFRFT and MA-DFRFT\\nto halve the number of FFTs needed to compute these transforms, paving the way\\nfor applications in resource constrained environments.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T16:24:01Z\"}"}
