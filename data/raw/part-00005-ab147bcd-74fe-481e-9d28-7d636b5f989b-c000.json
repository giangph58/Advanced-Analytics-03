The basic problem is to determine the\\ncardinality of the largest such sets. In this paper, these eight invariants are\\ninvestigated on Sierpi\\\\'nski graphs $S_p^n$. They are determined for the\\nSierpi\\\\'nski graphs $S_p^2$, $p\\\\ge 3$. All, but the outer mutual-visibility\\nnumber and the outer general position number, are also determined for $S_3^n$,\\n$n\\\\ge 3$. In many of the cases the corresponding extremal sets are enumerated.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T10:56:51Z\"}"}
