The climate\\nof tidally locked rocky exoplanets orbiting M-dwarf stars may have intense and\\nhighly localised thunderstorm activity associated with moist convection on\\ntheir day side. The distribution and structure of lightning-producing\\nconvective clouds is shaped by various climate parameters, of which a key one\\nis atmospheric mass, i.e. surface air pressure. In this study, we use a global\\nstorm-resolving climate model to predict thunderstorm occurrence for a tidally\\nlocked exoplanet over a range of surface pressures. We compare two lightning\\nparameterisations: one based on ice cloud microphysics and one based on the\\nvertical extent of convective clouds. We find that both parameterisations\\npredict that the amount of lightning monotonically decreases with surface\\npressure due to weaker convection and fewer ice clouds. The spatial\\ndistribution of lightning on the planet changes with respect to the surface\\npressure, responding to the changes in the large-scale circulation and the\\nvertical stratification of the atmosphere. Our study provides revised,\\nhigh-resolution estimates for lightning activity on a tidally locked Earth-like\\nexoplanet, with implications for global atmospheric chemistry.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,physics.ao-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:13:49Z\"}"}
