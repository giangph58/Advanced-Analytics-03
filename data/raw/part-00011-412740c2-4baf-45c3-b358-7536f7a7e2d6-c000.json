{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11308v1\", \"title\": \"Constraints on Generalized Gravity-Thermodynamic Cosmology from DESI DR2\", \"summary\": \"We explore the cosmological implications of generalized entropic models\\nwithin the framework of Gravity-Thermodynamics (GT) approaches. These models,\\ncharacterized by three or four additional free parameters, are designed to\\ncapture deviations from the standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and can\\nreproduce well-known entropic formulations, including Tsallis, R\\\\'enyi,\\nSharma-Mittal, Barrow, Kaniadakis, and Loop Quantum Gravity entropies in\\nvarious analytical limits. We implement the corresponding cosmological models\\nusing a fully numerical GT approach to constrain the model parameters and to\\nstudy the evolution of the dark energy equation of state as a function of the\\nscale factor. Our Bayesian analysis, which incorporates the Pantheon+ and DESy5\\nsupernovae data alongside the recently released DESI-DR2/DR1 Baryon Acoustic\\nOscillation (BAO) measurements, shows that the data favor the standard\\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy, leading to a $\\\\Lambda$CDM-like late-time behavior.\\nIn this context, the three-parameter ($\\\\mathcal{S}_3$) entropic model appears\\nto be sufficient to capture the observed dark energy phenomenology.\\nFurthermore, a direct comparison of the Bayesian evidence indicates that the\\nthree-parameter model is preferred over the four-parameter ($\\\\mathcal{S}_4$)\\nvariant by a factor of $\\\\Delta\\\\log\\\\mathcal{B} \\\\sim -6$, while the GT approach\\nas a whole is significantly disfavored relative to the $\\\\Lambda$CDM model with\\nat least $\\\\Delta\\\\log\\\\mathcal{B} \\\\sim -8$ ($\\\\mathcal{S}_3$) to\\n$\\\\Delta\\\\log\\\\mathcal{B} \\\\sim -13$ ($\\\\mathcal{S}_4$), when using the DESy5 and\\nDESI-DR2 datasets.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:49:10Z\"}"}
