Then we calculate and compare power\\ndensities estimated from integral approach with Gaussian beam distribution and\\nsummation approach with the macro-particle allocation covering the particle\\nbeam phase space. After showing that both approaches converge to each other, we\\napply the macro-particle approach to study power absorbed and transmitted by\\nvarious apertures at the front end of the 9-ID beamline at the National\\nSynchrotron Light Source-II. Our analysis indicate that the electron beam\\nmisalignment could lead to unwarranted power deposition at tighter apertures\\nthat would have been otherwise difficult to account in the aperture\\ndesign/choice process using the geometric ray-tracing approach.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.acc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.acc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T10:58:36Z\"}"}
