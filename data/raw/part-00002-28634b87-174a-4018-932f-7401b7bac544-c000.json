One of the main\\nissues is the need for single-shot low-footprint qubit readout. Here, we\\ndemonstrate the single-shot in situ measurement of a compact qubit unit-cell.\\nThe unit cell is composed of two electron spins with a controllable exchange\\ninteraction. We report initialization, single-shot readout and two-electron\\nentangling gate. The unit cell was successfully operated at up to 1 K, with\\nstate-of-the-art charge noise levels extracted using free induction decay. With\\nits integrated readout and high stability, this foundry fabricated qubit unit\\ncell demonstrates strong potential for scalable quantum computing\\narchitectures.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T09:26:00Z\"}"}
