Observations with warm Spitzer and JWST revealed high and variable\\nbrightness in the planet 55 Cnc e.\\n  Aims. Inventory of the tidal effects on the rotational and orbital evolution\\nof the planet 55 Cnc e enhanced by the nonzero orbital eccentricity.\\n  Methods. The creep-tide theory is used in simulations and dynamical analyses\\nthat explore the difficult trapping of the planet rotation in a 3:2 spin-orbit\\nresonance and the most probable synchronization of the rotation.\\n  Results. The strong tidal dissipation of energy, enhanced by the non-zero\\norbital eccentricity, may explain the observed brightness anomalies. However,\\nthe strong dissipation should also circularize the orbit. The observed non-zero\\neccentricity, if true, would indicate that an unknown planet in a close orbital\\nresonance with 55 Cnc e perturbing the motion of this planet should exist.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:17:21Z\"}"}
