{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02474v1\", \"title\": \"Rigid m-percolation in limited-valence gels\", \"summary\": \"Determining the onset of rigidity in gels is a fundamental challenge with\\nsignificant practical implications across different applications.\\nLimited-valence, or patchy-particle systems have proven to be a valuable model\\nto study the relationship between microscopic interactions and macroscopic\\nmechanical properties. It has been suggested that the emergence of rigidity\\ncoincides with the formation of an infinitely spanning cluster of particles\\nwith at least three bonds. This work explores this hypothesis, its\\nimplications, and its broader applicability across a range of system\\nparameters, by associating the emergence of rigidity with m-percolation\\ntransition for m=3. The properties of m-percolation are developed using a\\nmean-field theoretical approach validated with numerical simulations, and used\\nto build phase and rigidity diagrams for different particle valences of both\\nsingle-component systems and binary mixtures of patchy particles. The\\ndifference between connectivity and rigidity percolation thresholds is found to\\nreduce with increasing valence, providing an explanation for the challenges\\nencountered in experimental attempts to distinguish isotropic connectivity\\npercolation from the onset of rigidity. For binary mixtures, we found a robust\\nminimum average valence, below which the gel is never rigid.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T10:50:17Z\"}"}
