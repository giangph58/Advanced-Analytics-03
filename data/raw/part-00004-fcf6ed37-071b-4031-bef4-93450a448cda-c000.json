Multi-attribute\\ndecision-making (MADM) is the most common approach used for network selection\\n(NS) in HWNs. However, existing MADM-NS methods face two major challenges: the\\nrank reversal problem (RRP), where the relative ranking of alternatives changes\\nunexpectedly, and inefficient handling of user and/or service requirements.\\nThese limitations result in suboptimal RAT selection and diminished quality of\\nservice, which becomes particularly critical for time-sensitive applications.\\nTo address these issues, we introduce in this work a novel weighting assignment\\ntechnique called BWM-GWO, which integrates the Best-Worst Method (BWM) with the\\nGrey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm through a convex linear combination. The\\nproposed framework achieves a balanced decision-making process by using BWM to\\ncompute subjective weights that capture user/service preferences, while\\nemploying GWO to derive objective weights aimed at minimizing RRP. The\\ndevelopment and validation of this framework establish a digital model for NS\\nin HWNs, marking the initial step toward realizing a digital twin (DT).\\nExperimental results show that integrating the proposed BWM-GWO technique with\\nMADM-NS reduces RRP occurrence by up to 71.3% while significantly improving\\nuser and service satisfaction compared to benchmark approaches.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T07:06:58Z\"}"}
