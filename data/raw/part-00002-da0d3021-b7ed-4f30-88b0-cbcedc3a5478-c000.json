{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15740v1\", \"title\": \"CaRoSaC: A Reinforcement Learning-Based Kinematic Control of\\n  Cable-Driven Parallel Robots by Addressing Cable Sag through Simulation\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces the Cable Robot Simulation and Control (CaRoSaC)\\nFramework, which integrates a simulation environment with a model-free\\nreinforcement learning control methodology for suspended Cable-Driven Parallel\\nRobots (CDPRs), accounting for cable sag. Our approach seeks to bridge the\\nknowledge gap of the intricacies of CDPRs due to aspects such as cable sag and\\nprecision control necessities by establishing a simulation platform that\\ncaptures the real-world behaviors of CDPRs, including the impacts of cable sag.\\nThe framework offers researchers and developers a tool to further develop\\nestimation and control strategies within the simulation for understanding and\\npredicting the performance nuances, especially in complex operations where\\ncable sag can be significant. Using this simulation framework, we train a\\nmodel-free control policy in Reinforcement Learning (RL). This approach is\\nchosen for its capability to adaptively learn from the complex dynamics of\\nCDPRs. The policy is trained to discern optimal cable control inputs, ensuring\\nprecise end-effector positioning. Unlike traditional feedback-based control\\nmethods, our RL control policy focuses on kinematic control and addresses the\\ncable sag issues without being tethered to predefined mathematical models. We\\nalso demonstrate that our RL-based controller, coupled with the flexible cable\\nsimulation, significantly outperforms the classical kinematics approach,\\nparticularly in dynamic conditions and near the boundary regions of the\\nworkspace. The combined strength of the described simulation and control\\napproach offers an effective solution in manipulating suspended CDPRs even at\\nworkspace boundary conditions where traditional approach fails, as proven from\\nour experiments, ensuring that CDPRs function optimally in various applications\\nwhile accounting for the often neglected but critical factor of cable sag.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T09:45:06Z\"}"}
