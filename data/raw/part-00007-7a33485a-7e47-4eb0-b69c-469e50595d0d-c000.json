The organization of these vortices near the wall can\\nbe modeled using the attached-eddy hypothesis, which effectively describes\\nvelocity statistics in the log-law region and energy-containing motions.\\nHowever, the complex geometry and diverse scales of vortex structures in wall\\nturbulence present significant challenges for developing and applying\\nphysics-based models. Here, we model wall turbulence as an ensemble of complex\\nvortices, offering a systematic approach to constructing turbulence fields\\nenriched with hierarchically organized hairpin vortex packets at a range of\\nReynolds numbers. The geometry and distribution of these vortex packets are\\ncalibrated to match physical observations and flow statistics. Our model\\nsuccessfully reproduces key features of wall turbulence, including mean\\nvelocity profiles, higher-order velocity fluctuation moments, near-wall\\nstreaks, and energy spectra that align with theoretical and numerical findings\\nof turbulent channel flows at friction Reynolds numbers from 1,000 to 10,000.\\nFurthermore, the constructed channel turbulence transitions rapidly to fully\\ndeveloped turbulence through direct numerical simulation, demonstrating its\\npracticality for generating inlet or initial conditions in numerical\\nsimulations. This approach significantly reduces computational costs associated\\nwith turbulence development while providing a robust framework for testing and\\nadvancing turbulence models based on vortex structures.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T10:27:44Z\"}"}
