{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06608v1\", \"title\": \"A Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning Method Based on Domain Knowledge\\n  Mapping\", \"summary\": \"In task-based few-shot learning paradigms, it is commonly assumed that\\ndifferent tasks are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.).\\nHowever, in real-world scenarios, the distribution encountered in few-shot\\nlearning can significantly differ from the distribution of existing data. Thus,\\nhow to effectively leverage existing data knowledge to enable models to quickly\\nadapt to class variations under non-i.i.d. assumptions has emerged as a key\\nresearch challenge. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a new\\ncross-domain few-shot learning approach based on domain knowledge mapping,\\napplied consistently throughout the pre-training, training, and testing phases.\\nIn the pre-training phase, our method integrates self-supervised and supervised\\nlosses by maximizing mutual information, thereby mitigating mode collapse.\\nDuring the training phase, the domain knowledge mapping layer collaborates with\\na domain classifier to learn both domain mapping capabilities and the ability\\nto assess domain adaptation difficulty. Finally, this approach is applied\\nduring the testing phase, rapidly adapting to domain variations through\\nmeta-training tasks on support sets, consequently enhancing the model's\\ncapability to transfer domain knowledge effectively. Experimental validation\\nconducted across six datasets from diverse domains demonstrates the\\neffectiveness of the proposed method.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T06:11:55Z\"}"}
