{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19559v1\", \"title\": \"Using the Translation Theorem for the Automated Stationkeeping of\\n  Extremely-Low Lunar Missions\", \"summary\": \"Extremely-Low Lunar Orbits (eLLOs) (altitudes $\\\\leq 50$ km) exhibit severe\\nperturbations due to the highly non-spherical lunar gravitational field,\\npresenting unique challenges to orbit maintenance. These altitudes are too low\\nfor the existence of stable `frozen' orbits, and naive stationkeeping methods,\\nsuch as circularization, perform poorly. However, mission designers have\\nnoticed a particular characteristic of low lunar orbits, which they have found\\nuseful for stationkeeping and dubbed the \\\"translation theorem\\\", wherein the\\neccentricity vector follows a predictable monthly pattern that is independent\\nof its starting value. We demonstrate this feature results from the low orbital\\neccentricity combined with the dominant effect of a particular subset of\\nsectoral and tesseral harmonics. Subsequently, automated stationkeeping\\nstrategies for eLLOs are presented, utilizing this theorem for eccentricity\\nvector control. Several constraints within the eccentricity vector plane are\\nexplored, including circular, annular, and elevation-model derived regions,\\neach forming distinct stationkeeping strategies for varying orbital\\nconfigurations. Subsequently, the optimal control profiles for these maneuvers\\nwithin the eccentricity plane are obtained using Sequential Convex Programming\\n(SCP). The proposed strategies offer computational simplicity and clear\\nadvantages when compared to traditional methods and are comparable to full\\ntrajectory optimization.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T08:08:06Z\"}"}
