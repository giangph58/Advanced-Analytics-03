The manifolds here are hyperbolic branched covers like those used by\\nGromov and Thurston, and the construction of their model Einstein metric is a\\nvariation of the hyperbolic metric written in polar coordinates.

The GH metrics are realized on complex hyperbolic\\nbranched covers constructed by Stover and Toledo. In this article we generalize\\nthe construction of FP to the complex hyperbolic setting and show that this\\nyields a negatively curved Einstein metric that asymptotically approaches the\\nmetric of GH.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG,math-ph,math.GT,math.MG,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T13:39:20Z\"}"}
