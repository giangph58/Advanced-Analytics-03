While previous theoretical investigations assumed fixed\\nnuclei, recent studies indicate that nuclear dynamics significantly influences\\nthe ICEC process. In this work, we incorporate the vibrational motion into an\\nanalytical model of the ICEC cross section including both energy and electron\\ntransfer. To validate this approach, we compare the results to the\\nadiabatic-nuclei approximation based on fixed-nuclei ab initio R-matrix\\ncalculations. We apply our theory to the helium-neon dimer, which is ideal for\\nstudying diverse dynamical effects. We show that while vibrational dynamics can\\nslightly reduce ICEC efficiency, ICEC remains dominant over photorecombination\\nand can trigger dimer dissociation. Accounting for the nuclear motion also\\nenables to describe the broadening of the electron spectrum and enables\\nevaluation of temperature-dependent cross sections - capabilities beyond the\\nreach of fixed-nuclei approaches.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T12:02:08Z\"}"}
