These have\\nbeen extensively studied for tailoring light propagation. Most studies use an\\neffective medium approach that is extremely useful, though it misses out on\\nproperties that can arise from the microscopic details of the HMM. In\\nparticular, the HMM can have cavity-like modes, and it is important to\\nunderstand such modes and their relevance in light propagation and coupling of\\nHMM to quantum emitters. In this work, we bring out the cavity-like modes of\\nthe silver nanowire-alumina two-dimensional HMM, which remain on top of the\\nbroad response of the HMM. These modes define the characteristic reflection\\nspectra. The observed resonances and their widths are in good agreement with\\nour simulations. These well-defined modes occur even though the metallic part\\nof the HMM has Ohmic losses. Then, we present experimental results on the\\ncoupling of quantum emitters to the cavity-like modes of the HMM. We present\\nresults for both steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence. Using these,\\nwe extract the corresponding Purcell factors for radiative rate enhancement.\\nTheoretical analyses of the experimental data allow the determination of the\\ncavity coupling parameters and mode volumes. These experimental results are\\nconfirmed by the FDTD calculations for the HMM mode volume. This work\\nelucidates the pathway to precise engineering for future applications of HMM\\nmodes in strong light-matter interactions.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:18:12Z\"}"}
