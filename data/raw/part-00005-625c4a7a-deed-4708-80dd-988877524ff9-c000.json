{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19633v1\", \"title\": \"Ferroelectric and Hyper Dielectric modes in Ferronematic Liquid Crystals\", \"summary\": \"Binary mixtures of the ferronematic compound DIO with recently reported\\nnon-ferroelectric material WJ-16 which shows Colossal Permittivity (CP) ~5000\\nand superparaelectricity (SPE) were studied by POM, electrical switching\\nstudies, and dielectric spectroscopy. Three mixtures with different contents of\\nWJ-16 as 10, 25 and 50% in DIO as host were prepared. Our original expectation\\nwas the development of new nematic materials with both ferroelectric nematic\\n(NF) and non-ferroelectric CP phases. The non-ferroelectric phase in mixtures\\nexhibits a CP mode originally observed in pure WJ-16 and was termed as\\nsuperparaelectric. However, the dielectric spectroscopy of mixtures shows two\\ndistinct relaxation processes: the typical paraelectric response and the CP\\nmode. Therefore, this CP mode cannot be called superparaelectric and is\\nredefined it as Hyper Dielectric mode. This is the first direct demonstration\\nof materials with both ferroelectric and Hyper-dielectric phases in liquid\\ncrystalline materials. The hyper dielectric phase has a good potential as a\\nworking media for supercapacitors industry.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T09:49:28Z\"}"}
