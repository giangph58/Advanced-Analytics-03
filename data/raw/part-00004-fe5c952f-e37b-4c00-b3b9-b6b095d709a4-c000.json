We show how to recover from it the even filtration of\\nHahn-Raksit-Wilson, and (a Nygaard-completion of) the filtered prismatization\\nstack of Bhatt-Lurie and Drinfeld. We prove that the moduli stack of oriented\\nelliptic curves of Goerss-Hopkins-Miller and Lurie is the even periodization of\\nthe spectrum of topological modular forms. Likewise, the chromatic moduli\\nstack, which we previously studied under the name of the moduli stack of\\noriented formal groups, arises via even periodization from the sphere spectrum.\\nOver the complex bordism spectrum, we relate even periodization with the\\nsymmetric monoidal shearing, in the sense of Devalapurkar, of free gradings.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG,math.AT,math.KT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T04:25:33Z\"}"}
