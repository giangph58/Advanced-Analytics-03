Aiming to contribute to this\\ndirection, in this work, we probe the well-known thermodynamic phase structure\\nof the Reissner Nordstr\\\\\\\"om Anti de Sitter (RN-AdS) black hole through the lens\\nof its quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). Can QPOs be influenced by black hole\\nphase transitions? Do they carry any signature of such transitions in their\\nobservational patterns? These were the central questions guiding our study. By\\nanalyzing the upper and lower QPO frequencies within the Relativistic\\nPrecession (RP) model, we observe that the frequency-temperature relationship\\nreflects distinguishing features corresponding to the small, intermediate, and\\nlarge black hole phases, offering insights into their stability properties. The\\nanalysis is further extended to other QPO models, including the Warped Disk\\n(WD) and Epicyclic Resonance (ER) models. The presence of distinct phase\\nstructures remains evident across all models which is an encouraging outcome\\nthat may be worth exploring further in the context of other black hole systems.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:07:49Z\"}"}
