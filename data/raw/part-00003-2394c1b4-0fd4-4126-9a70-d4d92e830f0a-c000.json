{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16858v1\", \"title\": \"Planning with Diffusion Models for Target-Oriented Dialogue Systems\", \"summary\": \"Target-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) remains a significant challenge in the LLM\\nera, where strategic dialogue planning is crucial for directing conversations\\ntoward specific targets. However, existing dialogue planning methods generate\\ndialogue plans in a step-by-step sequential manner, and may suffer from\\ncompounding errors and myopic actions. To address these limitations, we\\nintroduce a novel dialogue planning framework, DiffTOD, which leverages\\ndiffusion models to enable non-sequential dialogue planning. DiffTOD formulates\\ndialogue planning as a trajectory generation problem with conditional guidance,\\nand leverages a diffusion language model to estimate the likelihood of the\\ndialogue trajectory. To optimize the dialogue action strategies, DiffTOD\\nintroduces three tailored guidance mechanisms for different target types,\\noffering flexible guidance towards diverse TOD targets at test time. Extensive\\nexperiments across three diverse TOD settings show that DiffTOD can effectively\\nperform non-myopic lookahead exploration and optimize action strategies over a\\nlong horizon through non-sequential dialogue planning, and demonstrates strong\\nflexibility across complex and diverse dialogue scenarios.
