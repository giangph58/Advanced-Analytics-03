The wave functions of the low-lying\\nstates are constructed as superpositions of configurations with different\\nintrinsic shapes and $K$ quantum numbers, projected onto good particle numbers\\nand angular momenta. The MR-CDFT successfully reproduces the main features of\\nthe low-energy structure in $^{43}$S. Our results indicate that the ground\\nstate, $3/2^-_1$, is predominantly composed of the intruder prolate\\none-quasiparticle (1qp) configuration $\\\\nu1/2^-[321]$. In contrast, the\\n$7/2^-_1$ state is identified as a high-$K$ isomer, primarily built on the\\nprolate 1qp configuration $\\\\nu7/2^-[303]$. Additionally, the $3/2^-_2$ state is\\nfound to be an admixture dominated by an oblate configuration with $K^\\\\pi =\\n1/2^-$, along with a small contribution from a prolate configuration with\\n$K^\\\\pi = 3/2^-$. These results demonstrate the capability of MR-CDFT to capture\\nthe intricate interplay among shape coexistence, $K$-mixing, and isomerism in\\nthe low-energy structure of odd-mass nuclei around $N = 28$.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:43:48Z\"}"}
