{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24214v1\", \"title\": \"Moving Edge for On-Demand Edge Computing: An Uncertainty-aware Approach\", \"summary\": \"We study an edge demand response problem where, based on historical edge\\nworkload demands, an edge provider needs to dispatch moving computing units,\\ne.g. truck-carried modular data centers, in response to emerging hotspots\\nwithin service area. The goal of edge provider is to maximize the expected\\nrevenue brought by serving congested users with satisfactory performance, while\\nminimizing the costs of moving units and the potential service-level agreement\\nviolation penalty for interrupted services. The challenge is to make robust\\npredictions for future demands, as well as optimized moving unit dispatching\\ndecisions. We propose a learning-based, uncertain-aware moving unit scheduling\\nframework, URANUS, to address this problem. Our framework novelly combines\\nBayesian deep learning and distributionally robust approximation to make\\npredictions that are robust to data, model and distributional uncertainties in\\ndeep learning-based prediction models. Based on the robust prediction outputs,\\nwe further propose an efficient planning algorithm to optimize moving unit\\nscheduling in an online manner. Simulation experiments show that URANUS can\\nsignificantly improve robustness in decision making, and achieve superior\\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art reinforcement learning,\\nuncertainty-agnostic learning-based methods, and other baselines.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:32:05Z\"}"}
