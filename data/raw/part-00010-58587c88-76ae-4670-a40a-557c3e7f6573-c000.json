{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17290v1\", \"title\": \"Incompressible and fast rotation limits for 3D compressible rotating\\n  Euler system with general initial data\", \"summary\": \"This paper is concerned with the low Mach and Rossby number limits of $3$D\\ncompressible rotating Euler equations with ill-prepared initial data in the\\nwhole space. More precisely, the initial data is the sum of a $3$D part and a\\n$2$D part. With the help of a suitable intermediate system, we perform this\\nsingular limit rigorously with the target system being a $2$D QG-type. This\\nparticularly gives an affirmative answer to the question raised by Ngo and\\nScrobogna [\\\\emph{Discrete Contin. Dyn. Syst.}, 38 (2018), pp. 749-789]. As a\\nby-product, our proof gives a rigorous justification from the $2$D inviscid\\nrotating shallow water equations to the $2$D QG equations in whole space.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T06:36:04Z\"}"}
