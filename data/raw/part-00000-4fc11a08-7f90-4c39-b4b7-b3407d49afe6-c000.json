{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10913v1\", \"title\": \"douka: A universal platform of data assimilation for materials modeling\", \"summary\": \"A large-scale, general-purpose data assimilation (DA) platform for materials\\nmodeling, douka, was developed and applied to nonlinear materials models. The\\nplatform demonstrated its effectiveness in estimating physical properties that\\ncannot be directly obtained from observed data. DA was successfully performed\\nusing experimental images of oxygen evolution reaction at a water electrolysis\\nelectrode, enabling the estimation of oxygen gas injection velocity and bubble\\ncontact angle. Furthermore, large-scale ensemble DA was conducted on the\\nsupercomputer Fugaku, achieving state estimation with up to 8,192 ensemble\\nmembers. The results confirmed that runtime scaling for the prediction step\\nfollows the weak scaling law, ensuring computational efficiency even with\\nincreased ensemble sizes. These findings highlight the potential of douka as a\\nnew approach for data-driven materials science, integrating experimental data\\nwith numerical simulation.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T06:49:24Z\"}"}
