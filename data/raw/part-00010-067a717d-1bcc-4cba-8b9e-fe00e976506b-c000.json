{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07953v1\", \"title\": \"Free monad sequences and extension operations\", \"summary\": \"In the first part of this article, we give an analysis of the free monad\\nsequence in non-cocomplete categories, with the needed colimits explicitly\\nparametrized. This enables us to state a more finely grained functoriality\\nprinciple for free monad and monoid sequences.\\n  In the second part, we deal with the problem of functorially extending via\\npullback squares a category of maps along the category of coalgebras of an\\nalgebraic weak factorization system. This generalizes the classical problem of\\nextending a class of maps along the left class of a weak factorization system\\nin the sense of pullback squares where the vertical maps are in the chosen\\nclass and the bottom map is in the left class. Such situations arise in the\\ncontext of model structures where one might wish to extend fibrations along\\ntrivial cofibrations. We derive suitable conditions for the algebraic analogue\\nof weak saturation of the extension problem, using the results of the first\\npart to reduce the technical burden.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CT\", \"categories\": \"math.CT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:58:02Z\"}"}
