The\\ntime derivative terms are discretized by using the first- and second-order\\nimplicit backward difference formulas (BDF1 and BDF2) that are well suited for\\nsolving steady-state and time-dependent viscous flows at high Reynolds numbers,\\nrespectively. The nonlinear system of discrete equations at each physical\\ntimestep is solved by using a dual time-stepping technique. The proposed scheme\\nis provably entropy-stable and positivity-preserving and provides unconditional\\nstability properties in the physical time. Numerical results demonstrating\\naccuracy and positivity-preserving properties of the new dual time-stepping\\nscheme are presented for supersonic viscous flows with strong shock waves and\\ncontact discontinuities.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:07:05Z\"}"}
