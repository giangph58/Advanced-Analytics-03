In this\\nsense, we have in-situ observational evidence from the solar wind and planetary\\nenvironments, which reveal not only wave fluctuations at kinetic scales of\\nelectrons and protons, but also non-equilibrium distributions of particle\\nvelocities. This paper reports on the progress made in achieving a consistent\\nmodeling of the instabilities generated by temperature anisotropy, taking\\nconcrete example of those induced by anisotropic electrons, such as,\\nelectromagnetic electron-cyclotron (whistler) and firehose instabilities. The\\neffects of the two main electron populations, the quasi-thermal core and the\\nsuprathermal halo indicated by the observations, are thus captured. The\\nlow-energy core is bi-Maxwellian, and the halo is described for the first time\\nby a regularized (bi-)$\\\\kappa$-distribution (RKD), which was recently\\nintroduced to fix inconsistencies of standard $\\\\kappa$-distributions (SKD). In\\nthe absence of a analytical RKD dispersion kinetic formalism (involving tedious\\nand laborious derivations), both the dispersion and (in)stability properties\\nare directly solved numerically using the numerical Arbitrary Linear Plasma\\nSolver (ALPS). The results have an increased degree of confidence, considering\\nthe successful testing of the ALPS on previous results with established\\ndistributions.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T14:50:39Z\"}"}
