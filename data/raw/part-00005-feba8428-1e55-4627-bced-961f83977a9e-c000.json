We examine the\\nconsistency of the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis (EKC) and the\\npollution heaven hypothesis (PHH) in Vietnam case. In 1986 Vietnam government\\nbegan to launch free-market economic reforms. Since then, Vietnam economy\\nexperienced the breakthrough innovation in trade openness. On the other hand,\\nVietnam witness a growing level of CO2 emission. The annual growth rate of CO2\\nemission during the period is 7.26%, and that of trade volume is 16.11%. The\\nempirical results show that the relationship between CO2 emissions and income\\nper capita is an inverted U-shaped, consistent with to EKC hypothesis. We also\\nfind that the pollution heaven hypothesis is supported in that energy use and\\ninternational trade contribute to air pollution, but becoming a full member of\\nWTO brings positive effect to Vietnamese environment.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T05:34:59Z\"}"}
