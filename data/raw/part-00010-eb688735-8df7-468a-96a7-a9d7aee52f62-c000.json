Furthermore, we provide explicit\\ndescriptions of the Kashiwara operators in the fundamental cases of 1- and\\n2-parameter persistence modules, offering concrete insights into the crystal\\nstructure in these settings.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RT\", \"categories\": \"math.RT,math.AG,math.RA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T03:56:47Z\"}"}
