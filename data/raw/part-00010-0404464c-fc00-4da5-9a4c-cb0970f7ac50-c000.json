{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19712v1\", \"title\": \"The effect of ion rotational flow on Hall thruster azimuthal instability\\n  via two dimensional PIC simulations\", \"summary\": \"Previous experimental studies have found that the neutral gas rotational flow\\nin the opposite direction of electron Hall drift can lead to better\\nexperimental results comparing to the same direction. In Hall thrusters, the\\ncore factor influencing operational states is the electron cross field\\ntransport, where the azimuthal instability serves as a key mechanism. The\\nrotational flow of neutral gas may affect instability by altering initial\\nazimuthal velocity of ions, which has not been investigated before. Therefore,\\nto study the effects of ion rotational flow of varying magnitudes and\\ndirections on azimuthal instability, simulations are conducted in this work\\nbased on two benchmark particle-in-cell (PIC) cases: the azimuthal-axial and\\nthe azimuthal-radial. The results indicate that the ion rotational flow\\nvelocity can potentially complicate the coupling characteristics of the\\nelectron cyclotron drifting instability and the modified two stream\\ninstability, particularly when a reverse rotational flow velocity is added. In\\ngeneral, both co-directional and reverse ion rotational flow have been observed\\nto inhibit azimuthal instability, which results in a decrease in axial electron\\nmobility. A 1% addition of the ion rotational flow (compared to the electron\\ndrift) would result in a 10% change of the electron mobility due to varied\\nazimuthal instability, and the decrease in electron mobility of the reverse ion\\nrotational flow is greater than that of co-directional. In addition, detailed\\nspectral analyses are carried out to study the relation between ECDI, MTSI, and\\nresonant wave-wave interactions.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T12:06:17Z\"}"}
