We utilize cascade\\ndetectors to efficiently identify sparse objects in multiresolution images.\\nGiven an object's prevalence and a set of detectors at different resolutions\\nwith known accuracies, we derive the accuracy, and expected number of\\nclassifier calls by a cascade detector. These results generalize across number\\nof dimensions and number of cascade levels. Finally, we compare one- and\\ntwo-level detectors in fluorescent cell detection, organelle segmentation, and\\ntissue segmentation across various microscopy modalities. We show that the\\nmulti-level detector achieves comparable performance in 30-75% less time. Our\\nwork is compatible with a variety of computer vision models and data domains.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T12:58:30Z\"}"}
