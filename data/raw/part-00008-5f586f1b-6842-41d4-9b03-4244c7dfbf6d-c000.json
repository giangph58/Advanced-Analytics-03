{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03282v1\", \"title\": \"Displacement and Stress Analysis of an Elastic Hollow Disk: Comparison\\n  with Strength of Materials' Prediction\", \"summary\": \"This paper analyzes the stress distribution in a two-dimensional elastic disk\\nunder diametric loading, with a focus on enhancing the understanding of\\nconcrete and rock materials' mechanical behavior. The study revisits the\\nBrazilian test and addresses its high shear stress issue near loading points by\\nexploring the ring test, which introduces a central hole in the disk. Using\\ndynamic elasticity theory, we derive stress distributions over time and extend\\nthe analysis to static conditions. This approach distinguishes between\\nlongitudinal and transverse wave effects, providing a detailed stress field\\nanalysis. By drawing parallels with curved beam theories, we demonstrate the\\napplicability of dynamic elasticity theory to complex stress problems, offering\\nimproved insights into the stress behavior in elastic disks.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,physics.class-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:09:14Z\"}"}
