For the\\nCauchy-Dirichlet problem, we prove the boundedness of any subthreshold\\nsolution. This implies, in particular, that all global unbounded solutions --\\nif they exist -- are threshold solutions. For the Cauchy problem, these\\nproperties fail in general but we show that they become true for a suitably\\nmodified notion of threshold. Our results strongly improve known results even\\nin the model case of power nonlinearities, especially in the Sobolev critical\\nand supercritical cases.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T06:50:49Z\"}"}
