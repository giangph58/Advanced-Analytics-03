{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12969v1\", \"title\": \"Lessons from commissioning of the cryogenic system for the\\n  Short-Baseline Neutrino Detector at Fermilab\", \"summary\": \"Results from commissioning and first year of operations of the cryogenic\\nsystem of the Short-Baseline Neutrino Detector (SBND) and its membrane cryostat\\ninstalled at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory are described. The SBND\\ndetector is installed in a 200 m$^3$ membrane cryostat filled with liquid\\nargon, which serves both as target and as active media. For the correct\\noperation of the detector, the liquid argon must be kept in very stable thermal\\nconditions while the contamination of electronegative impurities must be\\nconsistently kept at the level of small fractions of parts per billion. The\\ndetector is operated in Booster Neutrino Beams (BNB) at Fermilab for the search\\nof sterile neutrinos and measurements of neutrino-argon cross sections. The\\ncryostat and the cryogenic systems also serve as prototypes for the much larger\\nequipment to be used for the LBNF/DUNE experiment. Since its installation in\\n2018-2023 and cooldown in spring of 2024, the cryostat and the cryogenic system\\nhave been commissioned to support the detector operations. The lessons learned\\nthrough installation, testing, commissioning, cooldown, and initial operations\\nare described.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det,physics.acc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T14:19:34Z\"}"}
