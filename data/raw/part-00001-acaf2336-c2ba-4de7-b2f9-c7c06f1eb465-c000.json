{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12862v1\", \"title\": \"A Holomorphic perspective of Strict Deformation Quantization\", \"summary\": \"We provide and discuss complex analytic methods for overcoming the formal\\ncharacter of formal deformation quantization. This is a necessity for returning\\nto physically meaningful statements, and accounts for the fact that the formal\\nparameter $\\\\hbar$ carries the interpretation of Planck's constant. As formal\\nstar products are given by a formal power series, this naturally leads into the\\nrealm of holomorphic functions and analytic continuation, both in finite and\\ninfinite dimensions. We propose a general notion of strict deformation\\nquantization and investigate how one can use established results from complex\\nanalysis to think about the resulting objects. Within the main body of the\\ntext, the outlined program is then put into practice for strict deformation\\nquantizations of constant Poisson structures on locally convex vector spaces\\nand the strict deformation quantization of canonical mechanics on the cotangent\\nbundle of a Lie group. Numerous auxiliary results, many of which are well-known\\nyet remarkable in their own right, are provided throughout.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CV\", \"categories\": \"math.CV,math-ph,math.MP,math.QA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T11:40:43Z\"}"}
