We explore the same in transonic to supersonic compressible turbulence\\nof an isothermal ideal gas in two dimensions, driven by large-scale solenoidal\\nand irrotational stirring forces, via direct numerical simulations. We find\\nthat the scaling exponents of the order-$p$ negative moments of the\\ndistribution of exit times -- in particular, the doubling and halving times of\\npair separations -- are nonlinear functions of $p$. Furthermore, the doubling\\nand halving time statistics are different. The halving-time exponents are\\nuniversal -- they satisfy their multifractal model-based prediction,\\nirrespective of the nature of the stirring. However, the doubling-time\\nexponents are not. In the solenoidally-stirred flows, the doubling time\\nexponents can be expressed solely in terms of the multifractal scaling\\nexponents obtained from the structure functions of the solenoidal component of\\nthe velocity. Moreover, they depend strongly on the Mach number, $\\\\Ma$, as\\nelongated patches of high vorticity emerge along shock fronts at high $\\\\Ma$. In\\ncontrast, in the irrotationally-stirred flows, the doubling-time exponents do\\nnot satisfy any known multifractal model-based relation, and are independent of\\n$\\\\Ma$. Our findings are of potential relevance to astrophysical disks and\\nmolecular clouds wherein turbulent transport and mixing of gases often govern\\nchemical kinetics and the rates of formation of stars and planetesimals.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T06:36:29Z\"}"}
