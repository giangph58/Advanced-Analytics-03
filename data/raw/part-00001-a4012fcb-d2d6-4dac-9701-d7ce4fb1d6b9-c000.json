Anal. Appl., 1978] established that a\\nquasi-projective normal $G$-variety $X$ is spherical if and only if $G$-modules\\non the spaces $\\\\Gamma(X, \\\\mathcal{L})$ of global sections of $G$-equivariant\\nline bundles are multiplicity-free. This result was generalized by\\nKobayashi--Oshima [Adv. Math., 2013] and several researchers to (degenerate)\\nprincipal series representations of reductive Lie groups. The purpose of this\\nshort article is to show that the boundedness of the multiplicities in the\\nrestrictions of cohomologically induced modules implies the sphericity of some\\npartial flag variety.\\n  In our previous paper, we reduce the boundedness of the multiplicities to the\\nfiniteness of a ring-theoretic invariant $\\\\mathrm{PIdeg}$. To show the main\\nresult, we discuss the lower semicontinuity of $\\\\mathrm{PIdeg}$ on the space\\n$\\\\mathrm{Prim}(\\\\mathcal{U}(\\\\mathfrak{g}))$ of primitive ideals. We also treat\\nthe finiteness of the lengths of the restrictions of cohomologically induced\\nmodules.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RT\", \"categories\": \"math.RT\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T06:01:51Z\"}"}
