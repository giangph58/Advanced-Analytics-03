This study\\nproposes an accelerated sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm for 3D-3D rigid\\nregistration of transthoracic echocardiographic images with significant and\\nlimited overlap taken from apical window that is robust to the noise and\\nintensity variation in ultrasound images. The algorithm estimates the\\ntranslational and rotational components of the rigid transform through an\\niterative process and requires an initial approximation of the rotation and\\ntranslation limits. We perform registration in two ways: the image-based\\nregistration computes the transform to align the end-diastolic frame of the\\napical nonstandard image to the apical standard image and applies the same\\ntransform to all frames of the cardiac cycle, whereas the mask-based\\nregistration approach uses the binary masks of the left ventricle in the same\\nway. The SMC and exhaustive search (EX) algorithms were evaluated for 4D\\ntemporal sequences recorded from 7 volunteers who participated in a study\\nconducted at the Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute. The evaluations\\ndemonstrate that the mask-based approach of the accelerated SMC yielded a Dice\\nscore value of 0.819 +/- 0.045 for the left ventricle and gained 16.7x speedup\\ncompared to the CPU version of the SMC algorithm.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:06:24Z\"}"}
