{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16037v1\", \"title\": \"Adaptive Fault-tolerant Control of Underwater Vehicles with Thruster\\n  Failures\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents a fault-tolerant control for the trajectory tracking of\\nautonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) against thruster failures. We formulate\\nfaults in AUV thrusters as discrete switching events during a UAV mission, and\\ndevelop a soft-switching approach in facilitating shift of control strategies\\nacross fault scenarios. We mathematically define AUV thruster fault scenarios,\\nand develop the fault-tolerant control that captures the fault scenario via\\nBayesian approach. Particularly, when the AUV fault type switches from one to\\nanother, the developed control captures the fault states and maintains the\\ncontrol by a linear quadratic tracking controller. With the captured fault\\nstates by Bayesian approach, we derive the control law by aggregating the\\ncontrol outputs for individual fault scenarios weighted by their Bayesian\\nposterior probability. The developed fault-tolerant control works in an\\nadaptive way and guarantees soft-switching across fault scenarios, and requires\\nno complicated fault detection dedicated to different type of faults. The\\nentailed soft-switching ensures stable AUV trajectory tracking when fault type\\nshifts, which otherwise leads to reduced control under hard-switching control\\nstrategies. We conduct numerical simulations with diverse AUV thruster fault\\nsettings. The results demonstrate that the proposed control can provide smooth\\ntransition across thruster failures, and effectively sustain AUV trajectory\\ntracking control in case of thruster failures and failure shifts.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T17:02:29Z\"}"}
