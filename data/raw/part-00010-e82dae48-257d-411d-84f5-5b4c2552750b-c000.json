Recent\\nunconditional 3D molecular generation methods report saturated benchmarks,\\nsuggesting it is time to re-evaluate our benchmarks and compare the latest\\nmodels. We assess five recent high-performing 3D molecular generation methods\\n(EQGAT-diff, FlowMol, GCDM, GeoLDM, and SemlaFlow), in terms of both standard\\nbenchmarks and chemical and physical validity. Overall, the best method,\\nSemlaFlow, has a success rate of 87% in generating valid, unique, and novel\\nmolecules without post-processing and 92.4% with post-processing.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph,q-bio.QM\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T13:40:10Z\"}"}
