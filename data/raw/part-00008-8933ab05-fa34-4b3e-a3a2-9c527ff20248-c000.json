{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00431v1\", \"title\": \"Global multiplicity results in a Moore-Nehari type problem with a\\n  spectral parameter\", \"summary\": \"This paper analyzes the structure of the set of positive solutions of a\\nMoore-Nehari type problem, where $a\\\\equiv a_h$ is a piece-wise constant\\nfunction defined for some $h\\\\in (0,1)$. In our analysis, $\\\\lambda$ is regarded\\nas a bifurcation parameter, whereas $h$ is viewed as a deformation parameter\\nbetween the autonomous case when $a=1$ and the linear case when $a=0$. In this\\npaper, besides establishing some of the multiplicity results suggested by\\nprevious numerical experiments (see Cubillos, L\\\\'opez-G\\\\'omez and Tellini,\\n2024), we have analyzed the asymptotic behavior of the positive solutions of\\nthe problem as $h\\\\uparrow 1$, when the shadow system of the problem is the\\nlinear equation $-u''=\\\\pi^2 u$. This is the first paper where such a problem\\nhas been addressed. Numerics is of no help in analyzing this singular\\nperturbation problem because the positive solutions blow-up point-wise in\\n$(0,1)$ as $h\\\\uparrow 1$ if $\\\\lambda<\\\\pi^2$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CA\", \"categories\": \"math.CA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T10:01:14Z\"}"}
