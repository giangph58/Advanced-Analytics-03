{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24003v1\", \"title\": \"A Robust Extrinsic Single-index Model for Spherical Data\", \"summary\": \"Regression with a spherical response is challenging due to the absence of\\nlinear structure, making standard regression models inadequate. Existing\\nmethods, mainly parametric, lack the flexibility to capture the complex\\nrelationship induced by spherical curvature, while methods based on techniques\\nfrom Riemannian geometry often suffer from computational difficulties. The\\nnon-Euclidean structure further complicates robust estimation, with very\\nlimited work addressing this issue, despite the common presence of outliers in\\ndirectional data. This article introduces a new semi-parametric approach, the\\nextrinsic single-index model (ESIM) and its robust estimation, to address these\\nlimitations. We establish large-sample properties of the proposed estimator\\nwith a wide range of loss functions and assess their robustness using the\\ninfluence function and standardized influence function. Specifically, we focus\\non the robustness of the exponential squared loss (ESL), demonstrating\\ncomparable efficiency and superior robustness over least squares loss under\\nhigh concentration. We also examine how the tuning parameter for the ESL\\nbalances efficiency and robustness, providing guidance on its optimal choice.\\nThe computational efficiency and robustness of our methods are further\\nillustrated via simulations and applications to geochemical compositional data.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T12:27:42Z\"}"}
