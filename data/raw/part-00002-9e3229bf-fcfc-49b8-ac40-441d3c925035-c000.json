This study\\nanalyzes Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), focusing on how different\\ncommunication topologies Ring, Star, and Von Neumann affect convergence and\\nsearch behaviors. Using an adapted IOHxplainer , an explainable benchmarking\\ntool, we investigate how these topologies influence information flow,\\ndiversity, and convergence speed, clarifying the balance between exploration\\nand exploitation. Through visualization and statistical analysis, the research\\nenhances interpretability of PSO's decisions and provides practical guidelines\\nfor choosing suitable topologies for specific optimization tasks. Ultimately,\\nthis contributes to making swarm based optimization more transparent, robust,\\nand trustworthy.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T10:05:10Z\"}"}
