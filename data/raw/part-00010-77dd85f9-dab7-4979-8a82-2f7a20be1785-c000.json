It\\ncompares small and big data approaches, focusing on their distinct challenges\\nand the benefits of scaling. Traditional methods such as SVMs are contrasted\\nwith modern architectures like ConvTimeNet. The results show the importance of\\nusing and understanding Big Data in depth in the analysis and prediction of\\nfinancial time series.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:33:00Z\"}"}
