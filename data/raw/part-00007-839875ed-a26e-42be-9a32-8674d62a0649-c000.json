In our formulation, the challenging nonconvex and ill-posed\\ninverse problem is recast as the iterative minimization of a quadratic\\nsurrogate model that majorizes the original objective function. Our general\\nframework encompasses the Ptychographic Iterative Engine (PIE) family of\\nalgorithms. By efficiently solving the surrogate problem using a multigrid\\nmethod, our approach delivers significant improvements in both convergence\\nspeed and reconstruction quality compared with conventional PIE techniques.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T11:28:20Z\"}"}
