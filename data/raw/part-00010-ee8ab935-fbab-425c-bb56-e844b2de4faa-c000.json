{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01346v1\", \"title\": \"GTR: Graph-Table-RAG for Cross-Table Question Answering\", \"summary\": \"Beyond pure text, a substantial amount of knowledge is stored in tables. In\\nreal-world scenarios, user questions often require retrieving answers that are\\ndistributed across multiple tables. GraphRAG has recently attracted much\\nattention for enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities by organizing external\\nknowledge to address ad-hoc and complex questions, exemplifying a promising\\ndirection for cross-table question answering. In this paper, to address the\\ncurrent gap in available data, we first introduce a multi-table benchmark,\\nMutliTableQA, comprising 60k tables and 25k user queries collected from\\nreal-world sources. Then, we propose the first Graph-Table-RAG framework,\\nnamely GTR, which reorganizes table corpora into a heterogeneous graph, employs\\na hierarchical coarse-to-fine retrieval process to extract the most relevant\\ntables, and integrates graph-aware prompting for downstream LLMs' tabular\\nreasoning. Extensive experiments show that GTR exhibits superior cross-table\\nquestion-answering performance while maintaining high deployment efficiency,\\ndemonstrating its real-world practical applicability.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.IR,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T04:24:41Z\"}"}
