DL model performance heavily relies on\\nnetwork depth. Specifically, deeper DL architectures yield better segmentation\\nperformance. However, as models grow deeper, traditional one-point supervision\\nat the final layer struggles to optimize intermediate feature representations,\\nleading to subpar training outcomes. To address this, we propose an\\nintermediate Multi-access Supervision and Regularization (iMacSR) strategy. The\\nproposed iMacSR introduces two novel components: (I) mutual information between\\nlatent features and ground truth as intermediate supervision loss ensures\\nrobust feature alignment at multiple network depths; and (II) negative entropy\\nregularization on hidden features discourages overconfident predictions and\\nmitigates overfitting. These intermediate terms are combined into the original\\nfinal-layer training loss to form a unified optimization objective, enabling\\ncomprehensive optimization across the network hierarchy. The proposed iMacSR\\nprovides a robust framework for training deep AD architectures, advancing the\\nperformance of perception systems in real-world driving scenarios. In addition,\\nwe conduct theoretical convergence analysis for the proposed iMacSR. Extensive\\nexperiments on AD benchmarks (i.e., Cityscapes, CamVid, and SynthiaSF datasets)\\ndemonstrate that iMacSR outperforms conventional final-layer single-point\\nsupervision method up to 9.19% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU).\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T08:52:56Z\"}"}
