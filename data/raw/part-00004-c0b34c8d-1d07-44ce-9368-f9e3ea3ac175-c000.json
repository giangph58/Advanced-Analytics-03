{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20948v1\", \"title\": \"DS_FusionNet: Dynamic Dual-Stream Fusion with Bidirectional Knowledge\\n  Distillation for Plant Disease Recognition\", \"summary\": \"Given the severe challenges confronting the global growth security of\\neconomic crops, precise identification and prevention of plant diseases has\\nemerged as a critical issue in artificial intelligence-enabled agricultural\\ntechnology. To address the technical challenges in plant disease recognition,\\nincluding small-sample learning, leaf occlusion, illumination variations, and\\nhigh inter-class similarity, this study innovatively proposes a Dynamic\\nDual-Stream Fusion Network (DS_FusionNet). The network integrates a\\ndual-backbone architecture, deformable dynamic fusion modules, and\\nbidirectional knowledge distillation strategy, significantly enhancing\\nrecognition accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that DS_FusionNet\\nachieves classification accuracies exceeding 90% using only 10% of the\\nPlantDisease and CIFAR-10 datasets, while maintaining 85% accuracy on the\\ncomplex PlantWild dataset, exhibiting exceptional generalization capabilities.\\nThis research not only provides novel technical insights for fine-grained image\\nclassification but also establishes a robust foundation for precise\\nidentification and management of agricultural diseases.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:15:02Z\"}"}
