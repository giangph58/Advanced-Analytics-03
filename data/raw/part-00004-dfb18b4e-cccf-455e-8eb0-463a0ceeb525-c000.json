{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12128v1\", \"title\": \"An Algebraic Extension of Intuitionistic Linear Logic: The\\n  $L_!^S$-Calculus and Its Categorical Model\", \"summary\": \"We introduce the $L_!^S$-calculus, a linear lambda-calculus extended with\\nscalar multiplication and term addition, that acts as a proof language for\\nintuitionistic linear logic (ILL). These algebraic operations enable the direct\\nexpression of linearity at the syntactic level, a property not typically\\navailable in standard proof-term calculi. Building upon previous work, we\\ndevelop the $L_!^S$-calculus as an extension of the $L^S$-calculus with the $!$\\nmodality. We prove key meta-theoretical properties--subject reduction,\\nconfluence, strong normalisation, and an introduction property--as well as\\npreserve the expressiveness of the original $L^S$-calculus, including the\\nencoding of vectors and matrices, and the correspondence between proof-terms\\nand linear functions. A denotational semantics is provided in the framework of\\nlinear categories with biproducts, ensuring a sound and adequate interpretation\\nof the calculus. This work is part of a broader programme aiming to build a\\nmeasurement-free quantum programming language grounded in linear logic.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LO\", \"categories\": \"cs.LO,math.CT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T14:43:44Z\"}"}
