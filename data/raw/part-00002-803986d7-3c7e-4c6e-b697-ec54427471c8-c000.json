However, realizing\\nserendipitous recommendations is challenging due to the varying proportions of\\nusefulness and unexpectedness preferred by different users, which is influenced\\nby their differing desires for knowledge. In this paper, we propose a method to\\nestimate the proportion of usefulness and unexpectedness that each user desires\\nbased on their curiosity, and make recommendations that match this preference.\\nThe proposed method estimates a user's curiosity by considering both their\\nlong-term and short-term interests. Offline experiments were conducted using\\nthe MovieLens-1M dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\\nThe experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the same level of\\nperformance as state-of-the-art method while successfully providing\\nserendipitous recommendations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T07:15:06Z\"}"}
