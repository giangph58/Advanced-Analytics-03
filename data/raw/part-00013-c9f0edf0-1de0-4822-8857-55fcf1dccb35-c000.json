{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15811v1\", \"title\": \"KOMPASS: the new cold neutron triple-axis-spectrometer specialized for\\n  polarization analysis\", \"summary\": \"KOMPASS is a polarized triple-axis cold neutron spectrometer recently\\ninstalled at the FRM II neutron source. The instrument is designed to operate\\nexclusively with polarized neutrons and is specialized in longitudinal\\npolarization analysis using Helmholtz coils and spherical zero-field neutron\\npolarimetry using a Cryopad device. The advanced guide system polarizes and\\nfocuses flexibly in the scattering plane. A first, fixed parabolic focusing\\npart contains a series of three polarizing supermirror V-cavities that produce\\na highly polarized beam. By exchanging straight and parabolic front-end guide\\nsections, the resolution of the instrument can be optimized to meet\\nexperimental requirements. Large, double-focusing monochromator and analyzer\\nunits with pyrolytic graphite crystals enable efficient and adaptive energy\\nselection, and a compact supermirror cavity analyzes the final neutron\\npolarization. Alternatively, or in combination with this cavity, a Heusler\\npolarization analyzer can be used. KOMPASS offers full- and half-polarized\\nconfigurations with or without secondary energy analysis and provides a wide\\nrange of polarization options. Therefore, KOMPASS is well suited for various\\nstudies of static and dynamic magnetic correlations with energy transfers on\\nthe neutron energy loss side up to ~12 meV.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T11:50:57Z\"}"}
