Polystyrene (PS),\\npolypropylene (PP), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) nanoparticles with nominal\\ndiameters of 100, 54, and 262~nm, respectively, were analyzed by NEMS--FTIR\\nwith limits of detection (LoD) of 353~pg for PS, 102~pg for PP, and 355~pg for\\nPVC. The PS mass deposited on the NEMS chips was estimated from the measured\\nabsorptance values and the attenuation coefficient of PS. The wide spectral\\nrange of the FTIR allowed the identification of individual polymer\\nnanoparticles from a mixture. The potential of NEMS--FTIR for the analysis of\\nreal--world samples was evaluated by confirming the presence of polyamide (PA)\\nparticles released from commercial tea bags during brewing. Accelerated aging\\nof the tea bags under elevated temperature and UV radiation showed continuous\\nrelease of PA particles over time.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det,physics.app-ph,physics.atm-clus,physics.chem-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T12:53:59Z\"}"}
