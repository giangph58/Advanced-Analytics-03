{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10333v1\", \"title\": \"The Pierre Auger Observatory: Results and Prospects\", \"summary\": \"The Pierre Auger Observatory advances the study of ultra-high-energy cosmic\\nrays through a hybrid system of surface and fluorescence detectors. This paper\\npresents recent results, including refined spectrum measurements, anisotropy\\nevidence, and new insights into cosmic-ray composition. Studies at energies\\nbeyond terrestrial accelerators reveal implications for particle physics. The\\nAugerPrime upgrade will further enhance particle identification and extend the\\nsensitivity to photons and neutrinos, broadening the Observatory's capability\\nto explore cosmic-ray sources and propagation, paving the way for new\\ndiscoveries.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.IM,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T15:40:48Z\"}"}
