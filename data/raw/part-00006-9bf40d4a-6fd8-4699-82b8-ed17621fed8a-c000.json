{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04279v1\", \"title\": \"An exact parametrization of minimal seesaw model\", \"summary\": \"We propose a parametrization of neutrino masses and mixing in the minimal\\nseesaw model (MSM). The MSM, which introduces two heavy sterile neutrinos, is\\nthe minimal extension of the Standard Model in addressing the tiny masses of\\nactive neutrinos. The parametrization includes 11 free parameters: 6 neutrino\\noscillation parameters (2 mass-squared differences $\\\\Delta m^2_{21}$, $\\\\Delta\\nm^2_{31}$, 3 mixing angles $\\\\theta_{12}$, $\\\\theta_{13}$, $\\\\theta_{23}$, and 1\\nDirac phase $\\\\delta_{\\\\rm CP}$), 1 mass parameter in $0\\\\nu2\\\\beta$ decay\\n$m_{ee}$, and 4 additional parameters: 2 heavy neutrino masses $M_1$ and $M_2$,\\n1 active-sterile mixing angle $\\\\theta_{14}$ and 1 CP-violating phase\\n$\\\\delta_{14}$. This parametrization is derived exactly from the most general\\nneutrino mass matrix in the MSM without any approximation. We further discuss\\nits implications in phenomenological studies.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T09:31:29Z\"}"}
