{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20897v1\", \"title\": \"Elliptic leading singularities and canonical integrands\", \"summary\": \"We propose a generalization of $\\\\mathrm{dlog}$ integrands with unit leading\\nsingularities to the case covering integration of differential forms on\\nelliptic curves. We first construct a special algebraic basis of integrands,\\nincluding a differential one-form of the second kind, and match it to a Feynman\\nintegral ansatz in a suitable parametrization. Integration over a preferred\\nbasis cycle reveals their (elliptic) leading singularities. A simple\\ntransformation that sets all but one of the elliptic leading singularities to\\nzero and normalizes the remaining one to unity then defines the canonical\\nintegrands. In several examples, we observe that the corresponding Feynman\\nintegrals satisfy a special form of differential equation that has so far\\nremained unnoticed. It factorizes component-wise either $\\\\epsilon$ or $1 -\\nn\\\\,\\\\epsilon$ with integer $n$, and evaluates order-by-order in $\\\\epsilon$ to\\npure functions. We conjecture that our integrand-level construction universally\\nleads to such differential equations.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T16:14:03Z\"}"}
