{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06555v1\", \"title\": \"Dihedral solutions of the set theoretical Yang-Baxter equation\", \"summary\": \"We introduce the notion of a \\\\emph{braided dihedral set} (BDS) to describe\\nset-theoretical solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation (YBE) that furnish\\nrepresentations of the infinite dihedral group on the Cartesian square of the\\nunderlying set. BDS which lead to representations of the symmetric group on\\nthree objects are called \\\\emph{braided triality sets} (BTS). Basic examples of\\nBDS come from symmetric spaces. We show that Latin BDS (LBDS) can be described\\nentirely in terms of involutions of uniquely 2-divisible Bruck loops. We show\\nthat isomorphism classes of LBDS are in one-to-one correspondence with\\nconjugacy classes of involutions of uniquely 2-divisible Bruck loops. We\\ndescribe all LBDS of prime, prime-square and 3 times prime-order, up to\\nisomorphism. Using \\\\texttt{GAP}, we enumerate isomorphism classes of LBDS of\\norders 27 and 81. Latin BTS, or LBTS, are shown to be in one-to-one\\ncorrespondence with involutions of commutative Moufang loops of exponent 3\\n(CML3), and, as with LBDS, isomorphisms classes of LBTS coincide with conjugacy\\nclasses of CML3-involutions. We classify all LBTS of order at most 81.\", \"main_category\": \"math.QA\", \"categories\": \"math.QA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T03:23:52Z\"}"}
