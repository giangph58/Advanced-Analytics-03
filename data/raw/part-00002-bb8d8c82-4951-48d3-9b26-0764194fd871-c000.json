{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03288v1\", \"title\": \"Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Zonal Ancillary Market\\n  Coupling\", \"summary\": \"We characterize zonal ancillary market coupling relying on noncooperative\\ngame theory. To that purpose, we formulate the ancillary market as a\\nmulti-leader single follower bilevel problem, that we subsequently cast as a\\ngeneralized Nash game with side constraints and nonconvex feasibility sets. We\\ndetermine conditions for equilibrium existence and show that the game has a\\ngeneralized potential game structure. To compute market equilibrium, we rely on\\ntwo exact approaches: an integrated optimization approach and Gauss-Seidel\\nbest-response, that we compare against multi-agent deep reinforcement learning.\\nOn real data from Germany and Austria, simulations indicate that multi-agent\\ndeep reinforcement learning achieves the smallest convergence rate but requires\\npretraining, while best-response is the slowest. On the economics side,\\nmulti-agent deep reinforcement learning results in smaller market costs\\ncompared to the exact methods, but at the cost of higher variability in the\\nprofit allocation among stakeholders. Further, stronger coupling between zones\\ntends to reduce costs for larger zones.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MA\", \"categories\": \"cs.MA,cs.GT,econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:15:39Z\"}"}
