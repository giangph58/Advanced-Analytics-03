{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16558v1\", \"title\": \"The TeraZ Mirage: New Physics Lost in Blind Directions\", \"summary\": \"The next generation of high-luminosity electron-positron colliders, such as\\nFCC-ee and CEPC operating at the $Z$ pole (TeraZ), is expected to deliver\\nunprecedented precision in electroweak measurements. These precision\\nobservables are typically interpreted within the Standard Model Effective Field\\nTheory (SMEFT), offering a powerful tool to constrain new physics. However, the\\nlarge number of independent SMEFT operators allows for the possibility of blind\\ndirections, parameter combinations to which electroweak precision data are\\nlargely insensitive. In this work, we demonstrate that such blind directions\\nare not merely an artefact of agnostic effective field theory scans, but arise\\ngenerically in realistic ultraviolet completions involving multiple heavy\\nfields. We identify several concrete multi-field extensions of the Standard\\nModel whose low-energy SMEFT projections align with known blind subspaces, and\\nshow that these persist even after accounting for renormalisation group\\nevolution and finite one-loop matching effects. Our analysis highlights that\\nthe apparent sensitivity to new physics of TeraZ may be significantly\\noverestimated, and that indirect searches alone are often insufficient to rule\\nout broad classes of ultraviolet physics. Complementary high-energy collider\\nprobes are therefore essential to fully explore the SMEFT parameter space.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T09:34:07Z\"}"}
