Due to the dimensional reduction of a fermionic system\\nfrom $4D$ to $2D$, it is possible to study the influence of LIV on the Casimir\\neffect under the MIT bag boundary condition model in a low-dimensional setting,\\nwhere results are obtained without any approximations for a null-temperature\\nsystem. Moreover, the Matsubara formalism is applied to derive closed\\nexpressions for the influence of temperature on the physical observables:\\nCasimir energy, Casimir force, and entropy associated with the system in a LIV\\ncontext. For each thermal observable, the influence of the LIV correction term\\nis considered in the analysis of both low- and high-temperature regimes.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T17:41:33Z\"}"}
