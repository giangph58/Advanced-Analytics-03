Here,\\nwe provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the possibility of such a\\ndecomposition in the case of DAEs in Banach spaces. Moreover, we consider the\\nlarger class of linear operator pencils with bounded spectra and show that the\\nassociated homogeneous DAE can be reduced to an ODE and a seemingly simple DAE\\nof the form $\\\\frac d{dt}Tx = x$ with a quasi-nilpotent operator $T$. As\\nexamples show, there are cases with only the trivial solution and others with\\nnon-trivial solutions. We characterize the existence of $L^\\\\infty$-solutions on\\nthe half-axis, $L^2$-solutions on compact time intervals, and analytic\\nsolutions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T15:53:50Z\"}"}
