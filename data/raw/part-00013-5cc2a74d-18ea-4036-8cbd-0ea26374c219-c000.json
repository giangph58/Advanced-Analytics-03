{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05665v1\", \"title\": \"Experimental Evaluation of Precise Placement of the Hollow Object with\\n  Asymmetric Pivot Manipulation\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we present asymmetric pivot manipulation for picking up rigid\\nhollow objects to achieve a hole grasp. The pivot motion, executed by a\\nposition-controlled robotic arm, enables the gripper to effectively grasp\\nhollow objects placed horizontally such that one gripper finger is positioned\\ninside the object's hole, while the other contacts its outer surface along the\\nlength. Hole grasp is widely employed by humans to manipulate hollow objects,\\nfacilitating precise placement and enabling efficient subsequent operations,\\nsuch as tightly packing objects into trays or accurately inserting them into\\nnarrow machine slots in manufacturing processes. Asymmetric pivoting for hole\\ngrasping is applicable to hollow objects of various sizes and hole shapes,\\nincluding bottles, cups, and ducts. We investigate the variable parameters that\\nsatisfy the force balance conditions for successful grasping configurations.\\nOur method can be implemented using a commercially available parallel-jaw\\ngripper installed directly on a robot arm without modification. Experimental\\nverification confirmed that hole grasp can be achieved using our proposed\\nasymmetric pivot manipulation for various hollow objects, demonstrating a high\\nsuccess rate. Two use cases, namely aligning and feeding hollow cylindrical\\nobjects, were experimentally demonstrated on the testbed to clearly showcase\\nthe advantages of the hole grasp approach.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T04:24:16Z\"}"}
