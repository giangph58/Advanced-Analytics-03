There have been various discussions on theoretical justification,\\nproblems with the Jeffreys prior, and alternative objective priors. Among them,\\nwe focus on two types of matching priors consistent with frequentist theory:\\nthe probability matching priors and the moment matching priors. In particular,\\nno clear relationship has been established between these two types of priors on\\nnon-regular statistical models, even though they share similar objectives.\\n  Considering information geometry on a one-sided truncated exponential family,\\na typical example of non-regular statistical models, we find that the Lie\\nderivative along a particular vector field provides the conditions for both the\\nprobability and moment matching priors. Notably, this Lie derivative does not\\nappear in regular models. These conditions require the invariance of a\\ngeneralized volume element with respect to differentiation along the\\nnon-regular parameter. This invariance leads to a suitable decomposition of the\\none-sided truncated exponential family into one-dimensional submodels. This\\nresult promotes a unified understanding of probability and moment matching\\npriors on non-regular models.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T06:51:13Z\"}"}
