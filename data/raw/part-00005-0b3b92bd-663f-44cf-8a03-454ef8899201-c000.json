A frequency $K_i$ is computed with a sort of ${{i}\\\\choose{2}}$ optimal\\n$i$-vertex paths with given endpoints (optimal $i$-vertex path) in a\\ncorresponding $K_i$ in $K_n$. In frequency $K_i$, the frequency of an edge is\\nthe number of the optimal $i$-vertex paths containing the edge in the\\ncorresponding $K_i$. Given an $OHC$ edge related to $K_i$, it has a frequency\\nbigger than $\\\\frac{1}{2}{{i}\\\\choose{2}}$ in the corresponding frequency $K_i$,\\nand that of an ordinary edge not in $OHC$ is smaller than $\\\\frac{i+2}{2}$. On\\naverage, an $OHC$ edge in $K_i$ has a frequency bigger than\\n$\\\\frac{i^2-4i+7}{2}$ whereas an ordinary edge has a frequency smaller than 2.\\nMoreover, given a frequency $K_i$ containing an $OHC$ edge related to $K_n$,\\nthe frequency of the $OHC$ edge is bigger than $\\\\frac{1}{2}{{i}\\\\choose{2}}$ in\\nthe worst average case. It implies that the average frequency of an $OHC$ edge\\ncomputed with frequency $K_i$s is bigger than $\\\\frac{1}{2}{{i}\\\\choose{2}}$. It\\nalso found that the probability that an $OHC$ edge is contained in optimal\\n$i$-vertex paths keeps stable or increases according to $i\\\\in [4, n]$. As the\\nfrequency $K_i$s are used to compute the frequency of an edge, each $OHC$ edge\\nhas its own peak frequency at $i=P_0$ where $P_0=\\\\frac{n}{2} + 2$ for even $n$\\nor $\\\\frac{n+1}{2} + 1$ for odd $n$. For ordinary edges out of $OHC$, the\\nprobability that they are contained in optimal $i$-vertex paths decreases\\naccording to $i$. Moreover, the average frequency of an ordinary edge will be\\nsmaller than $\\\\frac{1}{2}{{i}\\\\choose{2}}$ if $i \\\\geq [0.3660n + 1.5849]$. Based\\non these findings, an algorithm is presented to find $OHC$ in\\n$O(n^62^{0.3660n})$ time using dynamic programming.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DM\", \"categories\": \"cs.DM,math.CO,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T09:12:47Z\"}"}
