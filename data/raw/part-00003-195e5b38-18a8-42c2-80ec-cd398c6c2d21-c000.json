{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06739v1\", \"title\": \"Selective Kondo screening and strange metallicity by sliding Dirac\\n  semimetals\", \"summary\": \"Kondo screening of local moments in normal metals typically leads to\\nhybridized conduction and valence bands separated by a Kondo gap, resulting in\\nan insulating state at half-band filling. We show a dramatic change of this\\nscenario in a Dirac-semimetal-based correlated system -- a bilayer honeycomb\\nlattice heterostructure where the local moment lattice is stacked on a Dirac\\nsemimetal breaking the inversion symmetry. This system is modeled by an\\nextended Anderson honeycomb lattice involving the real-space dependence of\\nmajor interlayer hybridization parameters on the relative sliding distance\\nalong the armchair direction. First, we unveil the multiple Kondo scales and\\nthe successive Kondo breakdown transitions in this correlated heterostructure\\nunder sliding. Second, we demonstrate the existence of a genuine selective\\nKondo screening phase which is stabilized near the A-B stack pattern and is\\naccessible by applying the interlayer voltage. Third, we find a nearly flat\\nhybridized band located concomitantly within the Kondo gap, resulting in an\\nunprecedented metallic state at the half-band filling. This unconventional\\nheavy fermion state is characterized by the violation of Luttinger theorem and\\nthe appearance of a Van Hove singularity at the Fermi energy. The general\\nsliding-driven band structure landscape and the implications of our results for\\nthe broad context of multiorbital Kondo physics are briefly discussed.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T09:51:47Z\"}"}
