{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20418v1\", \"title\": \"Theoretical Framework for Temporal Changes in Interactions among\\n  Adaptive Components of Living Systems\", \"summary\": \"In living systems, each component adaptively changes its internal states in\\nresponse to its interactions with other components. These interactions, in\\nturn, undergo temporal changes as a result of this adaptive behavior, which\\nplays a crucial role in the emergence of system-level functions. Thus, to\\nunderstand how changes in interactions influence the emergence of functions by\\nemploying models of adaptive behavior, it is essential to incorporate these\\ninteraction changes into these models. In this study, we developed a\\ntheoretical framework for modeling adaptive behavior of components under\\ntemporally changing interactions by formulating these interaction changes as\\ndynamics of energy landscapes associated with that behavior. To represent this\\ncomponent-level adaptive behavior, internal state changes of each component\\nwere formulated based on the generalized gradient flow of an energy landscape\\nand its associated energy rate landscape. We expressed dynamics of these\\nlandscapes by treating environmental states surrounding each component as\\ntemporal changes related to the interaction, which were then coupled to\\ninternal state changes of the component. Through case studies using simplified\\nmodels of living systems under multiple mechanical interaction conditions among\\ncomponents, we demonstrated that our proposed theoretical framework can\\nrepresent the emergence of functions of living systems. Even without explicitly\\ndefining adaptive behavior at the system level, these functions are specified\\nbased on the dynamics of the energy and energy rate landscapes of each\\ncomponent.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.bio-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.bio-ph,nlin.AO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T04:30:35Z\"}"}
