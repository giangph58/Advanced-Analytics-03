An investigation of numerical humor\", \"summary\": \"In a preliminary study of numerical humor, we propose the Perceived\\nSpecificity Hypothesis (PSH). The PSH states that, for nonnegative integers <\\n100, the funniness of a number increases with its apparent precision. A survey\\nof 68 individuals supports the veracity of this hypothesis and indicates that\\noddly specific numbers tend to be funniest. Our results motivate future study\\nin this novel subfield.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT,math.HO\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:52:12Z\"}"}
