Two\\ncomplementary paradigms have emerged in the pursuit of this objective: the\\nimperative approach, representing all allowed runs of a system in a graph-based\\nmodel, and the declarative one, specifying the rules that a run must not\\nviolate in a constraint-based specification. Extensive studies have been\\nconducted on the synergy and comparisons of the two paradigms. To date, though,\\nwhether a declarative specification could be systematically derived from an\\nimperative model such that the original behavior was fully preserved (and if\\nso, how) remained an unanswered question. In this paper, we propose a\\nthree-fold contribution. (1) We introduce a systematic approach to synthesize\\ndeclarative process specifications from safe and sound Workflow nets. (2) We\\nprove behavioral equivalence of the input net with the output specification,\\nalongside related guarantees. (3) We experimentally demonstrate the scalability\\nand compactness of our encoding through tests conducted with synthetic and\\nreal-world testbeds.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LO\", \"categories\": \"cs.LO,cs.FL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:17:34Z\"}"}
