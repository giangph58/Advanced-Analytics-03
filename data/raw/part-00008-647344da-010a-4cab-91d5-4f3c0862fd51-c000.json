Recently, it was shown in [arXiv:1909.07961v4 (2021)] that for such SDEs\\nthe equidistant Euler scheme achieves an $L^p$-error rate of at least\\n$(1+\\\\alpha)/2$, up to an arbitrary small $\\\\varepsilon$, for all $p\\\\geq 1$ and\\nall $\\\\alpha\\\\in(0, 1]$ in terms of the number of evaluations of the driving\\nBrownian motion $W$. In this article we prove a matching lower error bound for\\n$\\\\alpha\\\\in(0, 1)$. More precisely, we show that for every $\\\\alpha\\\\in(0, 1)$,\\nthe $L^p$-error rate $(1+\\\\alpha)/2$ of the Euler scheme in [arXiv:1909.07961v4\\n(2021)] can not be improved in general by no numerical method based on finitely\\nmany evaluations of $W$ at fixed time points. Up to now, this result was known\\nin the literature only for $\\\\alpha=1$.\\n  Additionally, we extend a result from [arXiv:2402.13732v2 (2024)] on sharp\\nlower errror bounds for strong approximation of SDEs with a bounded drift\\ncoefficient of fractional Sobolev regularity $\\\\alpha\\\\in (0,1)$ and constant\\ndiffusion coefficient at time point $1$. We prove that for every $\\\\alpha\\\\in\\n(0,1)$, the $L^p$-error rate $ (1 + \\\\alpha)/2$ that was shown in\\n[arXiv:2101.12185v2 (2022)] for the equidistant Euler scheme can, up to a\\nlogarithmic term, not be improved in general by no numerical method based on\\nfinitely many evaluations of W at fixed time points. This result was known from\\n[arXiv:2402.13732v2 (2024)] only for $\\\\alpha\\\\in (1/2,1)$ and $p=2$.\\n  For the proof of these lower bounds we use variants of the Weierstrass\\nfunction as a drift coefficient and we employ the coupling of noise technique\\nrecently introduced in [arXiv:2010.00915v1 (2020)].\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,cs.NA,math.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:11:46Z\"}"}
