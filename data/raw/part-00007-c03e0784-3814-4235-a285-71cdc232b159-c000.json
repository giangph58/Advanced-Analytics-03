{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04971v1\", \"title\": \"Moments of Causal Effects\", \"summary\": \"The moments of random variables are fundamental statistical measures for\\ncharacterizing the shape of a probability distribution, encompassing metrics\\nsuch as mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis. Additionally, the product\\nmoments, including covariance and correlation, reveal the relationships between\\nmultiple random variables. On the other hand, the primary focus of causal\\ninference is the evaluation of causal effects, which are defined as the\\ndifference between two potential outcomes. While traditional causal effect\\nassessment focuses on the average causal effect, this work provides\\ndefinitions, identification theorems, and bounds for moments and product\\nmoments of causal effects to analyze their distribution and relationships. We\\nconduct experiments to illustrate the estimation of the moments of causal\\neffects from finite samples and demonstrate their practical application using a\\nreal-world medical dataset.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T06:09:05Z\"}"}
