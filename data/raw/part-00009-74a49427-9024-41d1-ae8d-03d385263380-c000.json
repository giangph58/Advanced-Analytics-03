Yu-Oh set is the minimal quantum system with\\nstate-independent contextuality(SIC). However, its strength of the\\ncontextuality has not been taken into account. In this paper, we present a\\ngeneral method to determine whether there is a quantum state with strong\\ncontextuality in the quantum system composed of rank-one projectors. Based on\\nthis method, we conclude that Yu-Oh set does not have quantum states with\\nstrong contextuality. This indicates that strong contextuality and SIC are\\nmutually independent.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T09:10:55Z\"}"}
