Employing density matrix renormalization group\\n(DMRG) simulations, we explore the effects of spin-dependent tunneling\\namplitudes on these systems. Specifically, we analyze how bound states of three\\nfermions (trimers) impact Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO)\\nsuperconducting correlations at commensurate charge carrier densities, where\\n$2n_{\\\\uparrow} = n_{\\\\downarrow}$. In one-dimensional (1D) systems, trimer\\nformation is known to suppress FFLO correlations exponentially. Our results\\ndemonstrate that this suppression persists on ladder lattices of small width,\\neffectively mirroring the 1D behavior. However, we find a striking departure\\nfrom the 1D regime as the ladder width increases. On ladders with a width of\\nfour legs, the influence of trimers on superconducting correlations becomes\\nnegligible, suggesting that wider ladder systems provide a distinct environment\\nwhere FFLO-like pairing remains robust even in the presence of trimer states.\\nThese findings underscore the dimensional crossover in Hubbard systems and shed\\nlight on the mechanisms governing superconductivity and bound-state formation\\nin strongly correlated fermionic systems. Our work has implications for\\nunderstanding unconventional superconductivity in strongly correlated systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T13:33:06Z\"}"}
