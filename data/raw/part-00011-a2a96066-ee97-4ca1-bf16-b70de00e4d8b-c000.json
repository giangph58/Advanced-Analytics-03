{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12703v1\", \"title\": \"Spike-Kal: A Spiking Neuron Network Assisted Kalman Filter\", \"summary\": \"Kalman filtering can provide an optimal estimation of the system state from\\nnoisy observation data. This algorithm's performance depends on the accuracy of\\nsystem modeling and noise statistical characteristics, which are usually\\nchallenging to obtain in practical applications. The powerful nonlinear\\nmodeling capabilities of deep learning, combined with its ability to extract\\nfeatures from large amounts of data automatically, offer new opportunities for\\nimproving the Kalman filter. This paper proposes a novel method that leverages\\nthe Spiking Neural Network to optimize the Kalman filter. Our approach aims to\\nreduce the reliance on prior knowledge of system and observation noises,\\nallowing for adaptation to varying statistical characteristics of time-varying\\nnoise. Furthermore, we investigate the potential of SNNs in improving the\\ncomputational efficiency of the Kalman filter. In our method, we design an\\nintegration strategy between the SNN and the Kalman filter. The SNN is trained\\nto directly approximate the optimal gain matrix from observation data, thereby\\nalleviating the computational burden of complex matrix operations inherent in\\ntraditional Kalman filtering while maintaining the accuracy and robustness of\\nstate estimation. Its average error has been reduced by 18\\\\%-65\\\\% compared with\\nother methods.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T07:16:54Z\"}"}
