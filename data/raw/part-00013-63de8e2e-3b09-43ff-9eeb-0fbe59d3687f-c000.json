Unlike\\ngenealogical classification, which examines the historical relationships\\nbetween languages, typology seeks to understand the diversity of human\\nlanguages by identifying common properties and patterns, known as universals.\\nIn recent years, computational methods have played an increasingly important\\nrole in typological research, enabling the analysis of large-scale linguistic\\ndata and the testing of hypotheses about language structure and evolution. This\\narticle provides an illustration of the benefits of computational statistical\\nmodeling in typology.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,q-bio.PE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T06:59:55Z\"}"}
