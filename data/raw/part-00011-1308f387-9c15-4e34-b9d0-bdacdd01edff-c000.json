We compute numerically dependence of spin conductivity\\n$\\\\sigma(\\\\omega)$ on the anisotropy $\\\\Delta$ and the ratio $r= \\\\Delta_2/\\\\Delta$,\\nin the large $\\\\Delta$ regime. We find that, when $0<r<1$, the low-frequency\\nconductivity assumes an anomalous form $\\\\sigma(\\\\omega)\\\\approx a \\\\omega^2 + b\\n\\\\Delta^{-2} $. In particular, when $\\\\Delta\\\\to\\\\infty$ the model becomes\\ndynamically constrained and most states are localized. We show,\\nmicroscopically, existence of magnon bound states in the strong coupling\\nregime, which behave as self-generated disorders for single magnons. Based on\\nthis quasiparticle picture, we obtain analytical scalings, which match well\\nwith the numerical results.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:05:30Z\"}"}
