In open quantum systems (OQS), such bounds have been principally\\naffected by system environment coupling. In the recent past, drives on OQS have\\nshown to give rise to drive-induced dissipation (DID). In this work, we\\ninvestigate how DID affects the quantum speed limits. To this end, we use a\\nrecently-reported quantum master equation that takes into account environment\\nfluctuations and provide a closed form estimate of drive-induced dissipation.\\nOn such a system, we use Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) to find\\noptimal route to move from an initial state to a desired final state. Our key\\nresult is that there exists an optimal evolution time that maximizes fidelity.\\nThis work enables robust quantum control in open systems, addressing a key\\nchallenge in scaling quantum technologies. By improving fidelity and\\nefficiency, our method advances practical quantum computing under realistic\\ndissipative conditions.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:46:43Z\"}"}
