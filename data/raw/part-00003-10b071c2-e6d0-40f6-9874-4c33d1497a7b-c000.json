{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00536v1\", \"title\": \"Ground Orthogonal Arrays and Their Applications\", \"summary\": \"In computer experiments, it has become a standard practice to select the\\ninputs that spread out as uniformly as possible over the design space. The\\nresulting designs are called space-filling designs and they are undoubtedly\\ndesirable choices when there is no prior knowledge on how the input variables\\naffect the response and the objective of experiments is global fitting. When\\nthere is some prior knowledge on the underlying true function of the system or\\nwhat statistical models are more appropriate, a natural question is, are there\\nmore suitable designs than vanilla space-filling designs? In this article, we\\nprovide an answer for the cases where there are no interactions between the\\nfactors from disjoint groups of variables. In other words, we consider the\\ndesign issue when the underlying functional form of the system or the\\nstatistical model to be used is additive where each component depends on one\\ngroup of variables from a set of disjoint groups. For such cases, we recommend\\nusing {\\\\em grouped orthogonal arrays.} Several construction methods are\\nprovided and many designs are tabulated for practical use. Compared with\\nexisting techniques in the literature, our construction methods can generate\\nmany more designs with flexible run sizes and better within-group projection\\nproperties for any prime power number of levels.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T14:02:35Z\"}"}
