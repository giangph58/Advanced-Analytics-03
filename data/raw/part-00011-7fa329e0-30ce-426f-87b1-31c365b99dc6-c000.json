However, to date this measure has only been\\nanalyzed in the context of static graphs. In our work, we explore homophily in\\ndynamic settings. Focusing on graph convolutional networks (GCNs), we\\ndemonstrate theoretically that in dynamic settings, current GCN discriminative\\nperformance is characterized by the probability that a node's future label is\\nthe same as its neighbors' current labels. Based on this insight, we propose\\ndynamic homophily, a new measure of homophily that applies in the dynamic\\nsetting. This new measure correlates with GNN discriminative performance and\\nsheds light on how to potentially design more powerful GNNs for dynamic graphs.\\nLeveraging a variety of dynamic node classification datasets, we demonstrate\\nthat popular GNNs are not robust to low dynamic homophily. Going forward, our\\nwork represents an important step towards understanding homophily and GNN\\nperformance in dynamic node classification.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T04:32:29Z\"}"}
