Our first result constructs comparison isomorphisms\\nbetween absolute and relative local models in this context which relies on a\\nreformulation of the Eisenstein condition of Rapoport--Zink and\\nRapoport--Smithling--Zhang. Our second result lifts this comparison to\\ncategories of $p$-divisible groups and, as a corollary, to various kinds of\\nRapoport--Zink spaces. This unifies multiple previously known results in this\\ndirection. Our third result and main application is to the arithmetic transfer\\nconjecture of the third author. Using our statements about Rapoport--Zink\\nspaces, we extend his previous proof from the unramified case to that of all\\n$p$-adic local fields (for odd $p$). In general, our results have similar\\napplications to other problems around the arithmetic of Shimura varieties as\\nwell, removing several ramification assumptions in the literature.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG,math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T12:22:17Z\"}"}
