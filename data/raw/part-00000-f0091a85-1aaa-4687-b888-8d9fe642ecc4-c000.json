Using the Gaussian expansion method, we systematically\\nstudy these states, with calculating various properties such as mass spectra,\\ninternal contributions of each Hamiltonian component, root-mean-square radii,\\nand two-body strong decay widths. Our analysis of the mass spectra reveals no\\nstable state in this system. Furthermore, the root-mean-square radii suggest\\nthat the doubly-charmed hexaquark states exhibit a compact configuration. By\\nexamining the decay widths, we identify potentially detectable states and their\\nprimary decay channels within each subsystem. Despite the large decay phase\\nspace, we still find narrow states with total widths of less than 10 MeV. This\\nstudy provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the structures and\\ninteractions of doubly-charmed hexaquark states and offers valuable insights\\nfor future experimental searches.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:51:40Z\"}"}
