{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05775v1\", \"title\": \"Survey of the Edge Radial Electric Field in L-mode TCV Plasmas using\\n  Doppler Backscattering\", \"summary\": \"A Doppler backscattering (DBS) diagnostic has recently been installed on the\\nTokamak \\\\`a Configuration Variable (TCV) to facilitate the study of edge\\nturbulence and flow shear in a versatile experimental environment. The dual\\nchannel V-band DBS system is coupled to TCV's quasi-optical diagnostic\\nlauncher, providing access to the upper low-field side region of the plasma\\ncross-section. Verifications of the DBS measurements are presented. The DBS\\nequilibrium $v_\\\\perp$ profiles are found to compare favorably with gas puff\\nimaging (GPI) measurements and to the $E_r$ inferred from the radial force\\nbalance of the carbon impurity. The radial structure of the edge $E_r \\\\times B$\\nequilibrium flow and its dependencies are investigated across a representative\\nset of L-mode TCV discharges, by varying density, auxiliary heating and\\nmagnetic configuration.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T07:57:29Z\"}"}
