Existing approaches, such as inertial navigation,\\nDoppler Velocity Loggers (DVL), SLAM, and acoustic-based methods, face\\nchallenges like error accumulation and high computational complexity.\\nTherefore, a more efficient and scalable solution remains necessary. This paper\\nproposes an alternative approach that leverages an aerial drone equipped with\\nGNSS localization to track and localize a marine robot once it is near the\\nsurface of the water. Our results show that this novel adaptation enables\\naccurate single and multi-robot marine robot localization.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T03:18:59Z\"}"}
