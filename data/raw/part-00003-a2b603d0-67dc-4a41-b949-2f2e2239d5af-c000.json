We propose two transmission protocols: sequential (P1) and\\nsimultaneous (P2) AP transmissions, together with the ML estimators that either\\nleverage (coherent estimator) or disregard phase information (non-coherent\\nestimator). Simulation results reveal that downlink D-MIMO holds significant\\npotential for high-accuracy localization while showing that P2 provides\\nsuperior localization performance and reduced transmission latency.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T10:47:05Z\"}"}
