{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02559v1\", \"title\": \"Leveraging LLM For Synchronizing Information Across Multilingual Tables\", \"summary\": \"The vast amount of online information today poses challenges for non-English\\nspeakers, as much of it is concentrated in high-resource languages such as\\nEnglish and French. Wikipedia reflects this imbalance, with content in\\nlow-resource languages frequently outdated or incomplete. Recent research has\\nsought to improve cross-language synchronization of Wikipedia tables using\\nrule-based methods. These approaches can be effective, but they struggle with\\ncomplexity and generalization. This paper explores large language models (LLMs)\\nfor multilingual information synchronization, using zero-shot prompting as a\\nscalable solution. We introduce the Information Updation dataset, simulating\\nthe real-world process of updating outdated Wikipedia tables, and evaluate LLM\\nperformance. Our findings reveal that single-prompt approaches often produce\\nsuboptimal results, prompting us to introduce a task decomposition strategy\\nthat enhances coherence and accuracy. Our proposed method outperforms existing\\nbaselines, particularly in Information Updation (1.79%) and Information\\nAddition (20.58%), highlighting the model strength in dynamically updating and\\nenriching data across architectures\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T13:15:18Z\"}"}
