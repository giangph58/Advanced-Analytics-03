Here we propose that twisted\\nTMD heterotrilayers WX$_2$/MX$_2$/WX$_2$ with layer symmetry represents a\\nrealistic system for realizing topological exciton bands and interesting\\nmany-body excitonic phases, simply by tuning the twist angle. These symmetric\\nheterotrilayers form a type-II band alignment, where the electrons are confined\\nin the middle layer and holes are distributed among the outer two layers, for\\nthe lowest energy excitons. The outer two layers are then rotated at different\\ncenters by opposite angles, forming a helical structure. Interlayer excitons\\nwith opposite dipoles are hybridized by the coupling between outer two layers,\\nresulting in topological moir\\\\'e exciton bands. Furthermore, by constructing a\\nthree-orbital tight-binding model, we map the many-body phase diagram of\\ninteracting dipolar and quadrupolar excitons at different twist angles and\\nexciton densities and reveal the existence of sublattice-dependent staggered\\nsuperfluid and Mott insulator phases. The recent experimental observation of\\nquadrupolar excitons in symmetric heterotrilayers brings the intriguing phases\\npredicted in this study within immediate experimental reach.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T12:46:52Z\"}"}
