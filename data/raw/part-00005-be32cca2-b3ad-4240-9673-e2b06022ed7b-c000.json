Here we report an unexpected finding that the\\napproximants and motifs of dodecagonal quasicrystals can be spontaneously\\nformed in the simplest system of identical hard disks, utilizing the unstable\\nfeature of the initial square packing subject to mechanical perturbations.\\nBecause there is only one length scale involved, this finding challenges\\nexisting theories of quasicrystals and their approximants. By applying the same\\napproach to a system known to form a dodecagonal quasicrystal, we develop\\ndecent quasicrystalline order in a purely mechanical manner. With the aid of\\nthermal treatment, we achieve a significantly better quasicrystalline order\\nthan that from the direct self-assembly of the liquid state within the same\\nperiod of time. In sufficiently low temperatures where the self-assembly of a\\nliquid is significantly hindered, our approach still promotes the formation of\\nquasicrystals. Our study thus opens a venue for high-efficiency search and\\nformation of quasicrystals, and may have broader implications for the design\\nand synthesis of quasicrystalline materials.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T05:39:23Z\"}"}
