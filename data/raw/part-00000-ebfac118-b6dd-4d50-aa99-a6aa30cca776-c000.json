These new P-T phase diagrams provide a\\nsolution to long-standing disputes about their melting curves. Their\\nimplications extend to the melting and freezing of rocky materials in the\\ninterior of giant planets and super-Earth exoplanets, contributing to the\\nrefinement of their internal structure models.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,physics.data-an,physics.geo-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:48:04Z\"}"}
