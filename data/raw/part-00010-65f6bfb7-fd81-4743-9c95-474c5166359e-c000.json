In this\\narticle, we conduct a comparative analysis of the discrete-time quantum walk\\nalgorithm utilizing various coin operators to search for these exceptional\\nconfigurations. First, we study the emergence of several new exceptional\\nconfigurations/vertices due to the additional long-range edges of the HN4\\nnetwork on both one- and two-dimensional lattices. Second, our study shows that\\nthe diagonal configuration on a two-dimensional lattice, which is exceptional\\nin the case without long-range edges, no longer remains an exceptional\\nconfiguration. Third, it is also shown that a recently proposed modified coin\\ncan search all these configurations, including any other configurations in one-\\nand two-dimensional lattices with very high success probability. Additionally,\\nwe construct stationary states for the exceptional configurations caused by the\\nadditional long-range edges, which explains why the standard and lackadaisical\\nquantum walks with the Grover coin cannot search these configurations.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T12:33:42Z\"}"}
