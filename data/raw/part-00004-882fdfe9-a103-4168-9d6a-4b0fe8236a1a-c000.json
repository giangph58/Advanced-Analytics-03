The corpus includes 18.9 hours of in-the-wild Teochew\\nspeech data from multiple speakers, covering both formal and colloquial\\nexpressions, with precise orthographic and pinyin annotations. Additionally, we\\nprovide supplementary text processing tools and resources to propel research\\nand applications in speech tasks for this low-resource language, such as\\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS). To the best of our\\nknowledge, this is the first publicly available Teochew dataset with accurate\\northographic annotations. We conduct experiments on the corpus, and the results\\nvalidate its effectiveness in ASR and TTS tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T08:47:11Z\"}"}
