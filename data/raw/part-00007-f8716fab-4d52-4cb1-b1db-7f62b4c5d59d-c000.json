Annealing time was changed under specific conditions to achieve a stable\\ncopper (Cu) doping concentration for HgCdTe thin films. Both MWIR and LWIR\\nHgCdTe material were grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), where different\\ntrends were observed between LWIR and MWIR HgCdTe thin films by increasing\\nanneal time. We also report the impact of different thickness (4 micron, 6\\nmicron and 9 micron) along with annealing time on doping level of LWIR HgCdTe\\nthin films.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T16:14:33Z\"}"}
