With the advent of\\nthe foundational Segment Anything Model (SAM), the accuracy and efficiency of\\nnuclear segmentation have improved significantly. However, SAM imposes a strong\\nreliance on precise prompts, and its class-agnostic design renders its\\nclassification results entirely dependent on the provided prompts. Therefore,\\nwe focus on generating prompts with more accurate localization and\\nclassification and propose \\\\textbf{APSeg}, \\\\textbf{A}uto-\\\\textbf{P}rompt model\\nwith acquired and injected knowledge for nuclear instance \\\\textbf{Seg}mentation\\nand classification. APSeg incorporates two knowledge-aware modules: (1)\\nDistribution-Guided Proposal Offset Module (\\\\textbf{DG-POM}), which learns\\ndistribution knowledge through density map guided, and (2) Category Knowledge\\nSemantic Injection Module (\\\\textbf{CK-SIM}), which injects morphological\\nknowledge derived from category descriptions. We conducted extensive\\nexperiments on the PanNuke and CoNSeP datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness\\nof our approach. The code will be released upon acceptance.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T02:28:51Z\"}"}
