{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15235v1\", \"title\": \"Cascade IPG Observer for Underwater Robot State Estimation\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents a novel cascade nonlinear observer framework for inertial\\nstate estimation. It tackles the problem of intermediate state estimation when\\nexternal localization is unavailable or in the event of a sensor outage. The\\nproposed observer comprises two nonlinear observers based on a recently\\ndeveloped iteratively preconditioned gradient descent (IPG) algorithm. It takes\\nthe inputs via an IMU preintegration model where the first observer is a\\nquaternion-based IPG. The output for the first observer is the input for the\\nsecond observer, estimating the velocity and, consequently, the position. The\\nproposed observer is validated on a public underwater dataset and a real-world\\nexperiment using our robot platform. The estimation is compared with an\\nextended Kalman filter (EKF) and an invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF).\\nResults demonstrate that our method outperforms these methods regarding better\\npositional accuracy and lower variance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T17:10:10Z\"}"}
