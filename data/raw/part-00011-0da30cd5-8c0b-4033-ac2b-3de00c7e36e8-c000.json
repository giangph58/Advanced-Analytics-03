IRL Ditto offers a\\nunique hybrid experience by allowing in-person colleagues to encounter a\\ndigital version of their remote teammates, initiating greetings, updates, or\\nsmall talk as they might in person. Our research question examines: How can the\\nIRL Ditto influence interactions and relationships among colleagues in a shared\\noffice space? Through a four-day study, we assessed IRL Ditto's ability to\\nstrengthen social ties by simulating presence and enabling meaningful\\ninteractions across different levels of social familiarity. We find that\\nenhancing social relationships depended deeply on the foundation of the\\nrelationship participants had with the source of the IRL Ditto. This study\\nprovides insights into the role of embodied agents in enriching workplace\\ndynamics for distributed teams.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T06:16:32Z\"}"}
