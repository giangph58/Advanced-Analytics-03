{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07741v1\", \"title\": \"Harnessing Equivariance: Modeling Turbulence with Graph Neural Networks\", \"summary\": \"This work proposes a novel methodology for turbulence modeling in Large Eddy\\nSimulation (LES) based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which embeds the\\ndiscrete rotational, reflectional and translational symmetries of the\\nNavier-Stokes equations into the model architecture. In addition, suitable\\ninvariant input and output spaces are derived that allow the GNN models to be\\nembedded seamlessly into the LES framework to obtain a symmetry-preserving\\nsimulation setup. The suitability of the proposed approach is investigated for\\ntwo canonical test cases: Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence (HIT) and turbulent\\nchannel flow. For both cases, GNN models are trained successfully in actual\\nsimulations using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to ensure that the models are\\nconsistent with the underlying LES formulation and discretization. It is\\ndemonstrated for the HIT case that the resulting GNN-based LES scheme recovers\\nrotational and reflectional equivariance up to machine precision in actual\\nsimulations. At the same time, the stability and accuracy remain on par with\\nnon-symmetry-preserving machine learning models that fail to obey these\\nproperties. The same modeling strategy translates well to turbulent channel\\nflow, where the GNN model successfully learns the more complex flow physics and\\nis able to recover the turbulent statistics and Reynolds stresses. It is shown\\nthat the GNN model learns a zonal modeling strategy with distinct behaviors in\\nthe near-wall and outer regions. The proposed approach thus demonstrates the\\npotential of GNNs for turbulence modeling, especially in the context of LES and\\nRL.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T13:37:54Z\"}"}
