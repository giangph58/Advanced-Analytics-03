{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15118v1\", \"title\": \"Improving Sound Source Localization with Joint Slot Attention on Image\\n  and Audio\", \"summary\": \"Sound source localization (SSL) is the task of locating the source of sound\\nwithin an image. Due to the lack of localization labels, the de facto standard\\nin SSL has been to represent an image and audio as a single embedding vector\\neach, and use them to learn SSL via contrastive learning. To this end, previous\\nwork samples one of local image features as the image embedding and aggregates\\nall local audio features to obtain the audio embedding, which is far from\\noptimal due to the presence of noise and background irrelevant to the actual\\ntarget in the input. We present a novel SSL method that addresses this chronic\\nissue by joint slot attention on image and audio. To be specific, two slots\\ncompetitively attend image and audio features to decompose them into target and\\noff-target representations, and only target representations of image and audio\\nare used for contrastive learning. Also, we introduce cross-modal attention\\nmatching to further align local features of image and audio. Our method\\nachieved the best in almost all settings on three public benchmarks for SSL,\\nand substantially outperformed all the prior work in cross-modal retrieval.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.SD\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T14:16:46Z\"}"}
