We propose\\nMaxUCB, a max $k$-armed bandit method to trade off exploring different model\\nclasses and conducting hyperparameter optimization. MaxUCB is specifically\\ndesigned for the light-tailed and bounded reward distributions arising in this\\nsetting and, thus, provides an efficient alternative compared to classic max\\n$k$-armed bandit methods assuming heavy-tailed reward distributions. We\\ntheoretically and empirically evaluate our method on four standard AutoML\\nbenchmarks, demonstrating superior performance over prior approaches.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:18:05Z\"}"}
