In this\\npaper, we present HiScene, a novel hierarchical framework that bridges the gap\\nbetween 2D image generation and 3D object generation and delivers high-fidelity\\nscenes with compositional identities and aesthetic scene content. Our key\\ninsight is treating scenes as hierarchical \\\"objects\\\" under isometric views,\\nwhere a room functions as a complex object that can be further decomposed into\\nmanipulatable items. This hierarchical approach enables us to generate 3D\\ncontent that aligns with 2D representations while maintaining compositional\\nstructure. To ensure completeness and spatial alignment of each decomposed\\ninstance, we develop a video-diffusion-based amodal completion technique that\\neffectively handles occlusions and shadows between objects, and introduce shape\\nprior injection to ensure spatial coherence within the scene. Experimental\\nresults demonstrate that our method produces more natural object arrangements\\nand complete object instances suitable for interactive applications, while\\nmaintaining physical plausibility and alignment with user inputs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GR\", \"categories\": \"cs.GR,cs.CV,cs.MM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T16:33:39Z\"}"}
