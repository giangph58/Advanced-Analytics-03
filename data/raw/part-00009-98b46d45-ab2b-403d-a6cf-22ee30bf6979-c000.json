Integrating out graviton\\nmodes, we find higher-derivative instabilities that are shown to decay into\\nscalarons and causing an effective kinetic-domination stage where the universe\\nbehaves as a stiff fluid. Through slow cosmological expansion, the kination\\nstage leads to inflation. We find a natural cut-off for the scalaron magnitude\\nensuring positivity of the modified kinetic term which matches Planck\\nconstraints on inflaton energy density at the pivot scale. We, then, backtrack\\nto find that even for arbitrary initial conditions, kination naturally leads to\\nthe inflationary epoch without the need for fine-tuning. Modifications to the\\nscalar power spectrum are also shown to potentially explain low-$l$ anomaly in\\nCMB observations as well as the updated prediction of spectral index\\n$\\\\approx0.9743$ accounting for data from Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT).\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T12:40:36Z\"}"}
