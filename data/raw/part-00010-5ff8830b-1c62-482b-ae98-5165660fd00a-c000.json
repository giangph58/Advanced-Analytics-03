We assess the potential of this\\ntechnique to constrain the Hubble constant and the matter energy density. Our\\nanalysis incorporates realistic gravitational-wave source populations, error\\nmodelling calibrated on recent detector designs, and accounts for nuisance\\nparameters. We show that the tomographic angular cross-correlation could\\ndetermine the Hubble constant to percent or sub-percent precision depending on\\nthe binning choice, configuration and operation time of gravitational-wave\\nobservatories. This conclusion holds even when marginalising over the unknown\\ntracer biases, primordial power-spectrum parameters and baryon density. In\\nparticular, we show that the combination of the galaxy auto-correlation spectra\\nand the cross-correlation of gravitational waves and galaxy surveys can lead to\\nan improvement of up to a factor ${{\\\\sim}}10$ in constraining power over either\\nof the two probes taken individually. However, this prospect crucially relies\\non the presence of multiple gravitational-wave interferometers able to yield\\nprecise sky localisation. We also discuss the use of a spectroscopic redshift\\ncatalog, as well as the detectability of the clustering bias of\\ngravitational-wave sources.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:59:47Z\"}"}
