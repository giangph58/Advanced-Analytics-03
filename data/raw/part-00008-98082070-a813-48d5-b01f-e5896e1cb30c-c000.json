{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21369v1\", \"title\": \"Pupil Phase Series: A Fast, Accurate, and Energy-Conserving Model for\\n  Forward and Inverse Light Scattering in Thick Biological Samples\", \"summary\": \"We present the pupil phase series (PPS), a fast and accurate forward\\nscattering algorithm for simulating and inverting multiple light scattering in\\nlarge biological samples. PPS achieves high-angle scattering accuracy and\\nenergy conservation simultaneously by introducing a spatially varying phase\\nmodulation in the pupil plane. By expanding the scattering term into a Taylor\\nseries, PPS achieves high precision while maintaining computational efficiency.\\nWe integrate PPS into a quasi-Newton inverse solver to reconstruct the\\nthree-dimensional refractive index of a 180 um-thick human organoid. Compared\\nto linear reconstruction, our method recovers subcellular features-such as\\nnuclei and vesicular structures-deep within the sample volume. PPS offers a\\nscalable and interpretable alternative to conventional solvers, paving the way\\nfor high-throughput, label-free imaging of optically thick biological tissues.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T07:00:50Z\"}"}
