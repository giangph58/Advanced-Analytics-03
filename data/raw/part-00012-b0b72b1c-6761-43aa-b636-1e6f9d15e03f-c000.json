{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19850v1\", \"title\": \"To MT or not to MT: An eye-tracking study on the reception by Dutch\\n  readers of different translation and creativity levels\", \"summary\": \"This article presents the results of a pilot study involving the reception of\\na fictional short story translated from English into Dutch under four\\nconditions: machine translation (MT), post-editing (PE), human translation (HT)\\nand original source text (ST). The aim is to understand how creativity and\\nerrors in different translation modalities affect readers, specifically\\nregarding cognitive load. Eight participants filled in a questionnaire, read a\\nstory using an eye-tracker, and conducted a retrospective think-aloud (RTA)\\ninterview. The results show that units of creative potential (UCP) increase\\ncognitive load and that this effect is highest for HT and lowest for MT; no\\neffect of error was observed. Triangulating the data with RTAs leads us to\\nhypothesize that the higher cognitive load in UCPs is linked to increases in\\nreader enjoyment and immersion. The effect of translation creativity on\\ncognitive load in different translation modalities at word-level is novel and\\nopens up new avenues for further research.
