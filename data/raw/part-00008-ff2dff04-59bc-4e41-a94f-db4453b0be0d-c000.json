{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15040v1\", \"title\": \"The PHD/CPHD filter for Multiple Extended Target Tracking with\\n  Trajectory Set Theory and Explicit Shape Estimation\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we propose two methods for tracking multiple extended targets\\nor unresolved group targets with elliptical extent shape. These two methods are\\ndeduced from the famous Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) filter and the\\nCardinality-PHD (CPHD) filter, respectively. In these two methods, Trajectory\\nSet Theory (TST) is combined to establish the target trajectory estimates.\\nMoreover, by employing a decoupled shape estimation model, the proposed methods\\ncan explicitly provide the shape estimation of the target, such as the\\norientation of the ellipse extension and the length of its two axes. We derived\\nthe closed Bayesian recursive of these two methods with stable trajectory\\ngeneration and accurate extent estimation, resulting in the TPHD-E filter and\\nthe TCPHD-E filter. In addition, Gaussian mixture implementations of our\\nmethods are provided, which are further referred to as the GM-TPHD-E filter and\\nthe GM-TCPHD-E filters. We illustrate the ability of these methods through\\nsimulations and experiments with real data. These experiments demonstrate that\\nthe two proposed algorithms have advantages over existing algorithms in target\\nshape estimation, as well as in the completeness and accuracy of target\\ntrajectory generation.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T11:49:22Z\"}"}
