As a consequence, the\\ncentered empirical measure converges to a Gaussian field with explicit\\nasymptotic mean, and asymptotic variance given by the Dirichlet energy of the\\nbounded harmonic extension of the test function outside of the arc.\\n  A key tool in our analysis is the arc-Grunsky operator $B$ associated to\\n$\\\\gamma$, reminiscent to but different from the classical Grunsky operator. We\\nderive several basic properties the arc-Grunsky operator, including an estimate\\nanalogous to the strengthened Grunsky inequality and the relation to the\\nDirichlet integral. In our proofs $J^A(\\\\gamma)$ arises from the Fredholm\\ndeterminant $\\\\det(I+B)$ and a substantial part of the paper is devoted to\\nrelating this to the Loewner energy.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CV\", \"categories\": \"math.CV,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:19:09Z\"}"}
