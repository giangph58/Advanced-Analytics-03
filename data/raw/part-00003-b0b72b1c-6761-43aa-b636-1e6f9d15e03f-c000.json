{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19841v1\", \"title\": \"Inference with few treated units\", \"summary\": \"In many causal inference applications, only one or a few units (or clusters\\nof units) are treated. An important challenge in such settings is that standard\\ninference methods that rely on asymptotic theory may be unreliable, even when\\nthe total number of units is large. This survey reviews and categorizes\\ninference methods that are designed to accommodate few treated units,\\nconsidering both cross-sectional and panel data methods. We discuss trade-offs\\nand connections between different approaches. In doing so, we propose slight\\nmodifications to improve the finite-sample validity of some methods, and we\\nalso provide theoretical justifications for existing heuristic approaches that\\nhave been proposed in the literature.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.EM\", \"categories\": \"econ.EM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:41:13Z\"}"}
