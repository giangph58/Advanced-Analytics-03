{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05192v1\", \"title\": \"CHIME/FRB Outriggers: Design Overview\", \"summary\": \"The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) has emerged as the\\nworld's premier facility for studying fast radio bursts (FRBs) through its fast\\ntransient search backend CHIME/FRB\\\\@. The CHIME/FRB Outriggers project will\\naugment this high detection rate of 2--3 FRBs per day with the ability to\\nprecisely localize them using very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). Using\\nthree strategically located stations in North America and deploying recently\\ndeveloped synoptic VLBI observing techniques, the Outriggers will provide $\\\\sim\\n50$~milliarcsecond localization precision for the majority of detected FRBs.\\nThis paper presents an overview of the design and implementation of the\\nOutriggers, covering their geographic distribution, structural design, and\\nobservational capabilities. We detail the scientific objectives driving the\\nproject, including the characterization of FRB populations, host galaxy\\ndemographics, and the use of FRBs as cosmological probes. We also discuss the\\ncalibration strategies available to mitigate ionospheric and instrumental\\neffects, ensuring high-precision localization. With two stations currently in\\nscience operations, and the third in commissioning, the CHIME/FRB Outriggers\\nproject is poised to become a cornerstone of the FRB field, offering\\nunprecedented insights into this enigmatic cosmic phenomenon.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T15:42:23Z\"}"}
