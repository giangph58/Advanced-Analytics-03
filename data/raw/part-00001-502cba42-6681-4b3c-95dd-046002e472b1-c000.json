To demonstrate this effect, we present the results of\\nnumerical simulations of the time evolution of truncated SU(2) plaquette chains\\nand honeycomb lattices in 2+1D, starting from excited states with regions of\\nhigh energy density, and with and without entanglement.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,hep-lat,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T12:26:32Z\"}"}
