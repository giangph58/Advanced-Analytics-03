Being more specific,\\nwe will give some examples where the embedding $H(\\\\mathbb{R}^{N+1}_+)\\\\subset\\nL^2(\\\\mathbb{R}^N)$ is compact, with the space $H(\\\\mathbb{R}^{N+1}_+)$ depending\\non the operator $\\\\mathcal{A}$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA,math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T13:02:48Z\"}"}
