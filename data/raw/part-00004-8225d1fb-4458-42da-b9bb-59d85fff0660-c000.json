Let H be a graph, and a graph is called H-free if it does not\\ncontain H as a subgraph. Given a graph H, the Turan number of H in Q_n, denoted\\nby ex(Q_n, H), is the maximum number of edges of a subgraph of Q_n that is\\nH-free. A double star S_{k,l} is the graph obtained by taking an edge uv and\\njoining u with k vertices, v with l vertices which are different from the k\\nvertices. We say a double star is a balanced double star if k = l. Currently,\\nthe Turan number of the balanced star S_{n,n} is has been studied in the planar\\ngraphs. In the hypercubes, the researchers look for the maximum number of edges\\nof the graphs that are C_k-free. However, the Turan number of the double star\\nin the hypercube remains unexplored. Building upon prior research, we initiate\\nthe first study on the Turan number of the balanced double star in the\\nhypercube. In this paper, we give the exact value of the Turan number of the\\nbalanced double star S_{n-1,n-1} in the hypercube Q_n, which is 2^{n-3}*(4n- 3)\\nfor all n >= 3.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:11:58Z\"}"}
