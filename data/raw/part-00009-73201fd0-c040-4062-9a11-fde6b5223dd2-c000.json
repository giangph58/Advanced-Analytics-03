{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00322v1\", \"title\": \"AI2-Active Safety: AI-enabled Interaction-aware Active Safety Analysis\\n  with Vehicle Dynamics\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces an AI-enabled, interaction-aware active safety analysis\\nframework that accounts for groupwise vehicle interactions. Specifically, the\\nframework employs a bicycle model-augmented with road gradient\\nconsiderations-to accurately capture vehicle dynamics. In parallel, a\\nhypergraph-based AI model is developed to predict probabilistic trajectories of\\nambient traffic. By integrating these two components, the framework derives\\nvehicle intra-spacing over a 3D road surface as the solution of a stochastic\\nordinary differential equation, yielding high-fidelity surrogate safety\\nmeasures such as time-to-collision (TTC). To demonstrate its effectiveness, the\\nframework is analyzed using stochastic numerical methods comprising 4th-order\\nRunge-Kutta integration and AI inference, generating probability-weighted\\nhigh-fidelity TTC (HF-TTC) distributions that reflect complex multi-agent\\nmaneuvers and behavioral uncertainties. Evaluated with HF-TTC against\\ntraditional constant-velocity TTC and non-interaction-aware approaches on\\nhighway datasets, the proposed framework offers a systematic methodology for\\nactive safety analysis with enhanced potential for improving safety perception\\nin complex traffic environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T05:46:34Z\"}"}
