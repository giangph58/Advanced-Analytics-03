In\\nthe classical setup, this method of degenerating flag varieties by Feigin,\\nFourier and, Littelmann relies on constructing bases of representations of Lie\\nalgebras such that in the coordinate ring of an embedded flag varietiy their\\nmultiplication can be identified with an affine semigroup modulo terms of\\nhigher degree. By killing off said terms of higher degree via a filtration\\nconstruction, one gets a toric variety the embedded flag variety degenerates\\ninto. By adapting these techniques we provide a similar construction and\\ndiscuss when one can get a degeneration into a toric supervariety, as defined\\nby Jankowski\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG,math.RT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:18:42Z\"}"}
