{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10903v1\", \"title\": \"Efficient Reasoning Models: A Survey\", \"summary\": \"Reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable progress in solving complex and\\nlogic-intensive tasks by generating extended Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs) prior to\\narriving at a final answer. Yet, the emergence of this \\\"slow-thinking\\\"\\nparadigm, with numerous tokens generated in sequence, inevitably introduces\\nsubstantial computational overhead. To this end, it highlights an urgent need\\nfor effective acceleration. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive\\noverview of recent advances in efficient reasoning. It categorizes existing\\nworks into three key directions: (1) shorter - compressing lengthy CoTs into\\nconcise yet effective reasoning chains; (2) smaller - developing compact\\nlanguage models with strong reasoning capabilities through techniques such as\\nknowledge distillation, other model compression techniques, and reinforcement\\nlearning; and (3) faster - designing efficient decoding strategies to\\naccelerate inference. A curated collection of papers discussed in this survey\\nis available in our GitHub repository.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T06:28:00Z\"}"}
