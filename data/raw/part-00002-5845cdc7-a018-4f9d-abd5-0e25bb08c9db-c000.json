{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04944v1\", \"title\": \"Multiobjective Optimization under Uncertainties using Conditional Pareto\\n  Fronts\", \"summary\": \"In this work, we propose a novel method to tackle the problem of\\nmultiobjective optimization under parameteric uncertainties, by considering the\\nConditional Pareto Sets and Conditional Pareto Fronts. Based on those\\nquantities we can define the probability of coverage of the Conditional Pareto\\nSet which can be interpreted as the probability for a design to be optimal in\\nthe Pareto sense. Due to the computational cost of such an approach, we\\nintroduce an Active Learning method based on Gaussian Process Regression in\\norder to improve the estimation of this probability, which relies on a\\nreformulation of the EHVI. We illustrate those methods on a few toy problems of\\nmoderate dimension, and on the problem of designing a cabin to highlight the\\ndifferences in solutions brought by different formulations of the problem.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:30:53Z\"}"}
