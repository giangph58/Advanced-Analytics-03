This quantity provides one of the required ingredients for\\nextending the nested soft-collinear subtraction scheme to processes with\\nmassive final-state particles. To calculate it, we use the standard methodology\\ninvolving reverse unitarity and its extension to cases with Heaviside\\nfunctions, integration-by-parts technology and reduction to master integrals,\\nand differential equations. In addition, we also describe a semi-numerical\\nmethod based on the subtraction of infra-red and collinear singularities from\\nthe eikonal function, allowing us to extract divergences of the integrated\\neikonal function analytically, and to derive a simple integral representation\\nfor the finite remainder.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:48:17Z\"}"}
