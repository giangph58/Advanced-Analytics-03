Despite large uncertainties from scale\\nvariations and the $J/\\\\psi$ long-distance matrix elements, predictions for the\\ndifferential cross section and its $\\\\cos(2\\\\phi_\\\\psi)$ modulation are obtained.\\nWe find that physical constraints are satisfied in case a process-dependent\\nterm is included for color octet production, but not in all cases when it is\\nexcluded. These numerical results support the analytic calculations in\\n\\\\cite{Boer:2023zit}. Future experimental data can thus test the validity of TMD\\nfactorization in $J/\\\\psi$ production and explore the presence of nontrivial\\nprocess-dependent effects in the soft-gluon resummation. This will be crucial\\nin the extraction of gluon unpolarized and linearly polarized TMD distributions\\nof the proton. In addition, we suggest how the sign of the latter can be\\ndetermined by investigating the presence of a node in the $\\\\cos(2\\\\phi_\\\\psi)$\\nmodulation as a function of transverse momentum.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T09:26:21Z\"}"}
