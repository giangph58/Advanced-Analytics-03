{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12982v1\", \"title\": \"Accommodate Knowledge Conflicts in Retrieval-augmented LLMs: Towards\\n  Reliable Response Generation in the Wild\", \"summary\": \"The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced\\ninformation retrieval systems, particularly in response generation (RG).\\nUnfortunately, LLMs often face knowledge conflicts between internal memory and\\nretrievaled external information, arising from misinformation, biases, or\\noutdated knowledge. These conflicts undermine response reliability and\\nintroduce uncertainty in decision-making. In this work, we analyze how LLMs\\nnavigate knowledge conflicts from an information-theoretic perspective and\\nreveal that when conflicting and supplementary information exhibit significant\\ndifferences, LLMs confidently resolve their preferences. However, when the\\ndistinction is ambiguous, LLMs experience heightened uncertainty. Based on this\\ninsight, we propose Swin-VIB, a novel framework that integrates a pipeline of\\nvariational information bottleneck models into adaptive augmentation of\\nretrieved information and guiding LLM preference in response generation.\\nExtensive experiments on single-choice, open-ended question-answering (QA), and\\nretrieval augmented generation (RAG) validate our theoretical findings and\\ndemonstrate the efficacy of Swin-VIB. Notably, our method improves\\nsingle-choice task accuracy by at least 7.54\\\\% over competitive baselines.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T14:40:31Z\"}"}
