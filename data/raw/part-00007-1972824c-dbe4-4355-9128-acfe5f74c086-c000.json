This letter introduces an indoor\\nchannel measurement campaign designed to explore the behavior of multipath\\ncomponents (MPCs) in distributed massive MIMO channels. Fully coherent channels\\nwere measured between eight distributed uniform planar arrays (128 elements in\\ntotal) and a 12-meter user equipment route. Furthermore, a method is introduced\\nto determine the order (single- or multi-bounce) of MPC interaction by\\nleveraging map information and MPC parameters. In addition, a Kalman\\nfilter-based framework is used for identifying the MPC interaction mechanisms\\n(reflection or scattering/diffraction/mixed). Finally, a comprehensive\\nMPC-level characterization is performed based on the measured channels,\\nincluding the significance of the single-bounce MPCs, the spherical wavefront\\nfeatures, the birth-and-death processes of the MPCs, and the spatial\\ndistribution of reflections. The findings serve as a valuable reference for\\nunderstanding MPC propagation behavior, which is necessary for accurate\\nmodeling of indoor distributed massive MIMO channels.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T17:08:12Z\"}"}
