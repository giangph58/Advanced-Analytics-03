{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02324v1\", \"title\": \"Dynamic Assortment Selection and Pricing with Censored Preference\\n  Feedback\", \"summary\": \"In this study, we investigate the problem of dynamic multi-product selection\\nand pricing by introducing a novel framework based on a \\\\textit{censored\\nmultinomial logit} (C-MNL) choice model. In this model, sellers present a set\\nof products with prices, and buyers filter out products priced above their\\nvaluation, purchasing at most one product from the remaining options based on\\ntheir preferences. The goal is to maximize seller revenue by dynamically\\nadjusting product offerings and prices, while learning both product valuations\\nand buyer preferences through purchase feedback. To achieve this, we propose a\\nLower Confidence Bound (LCB) pricing strategy. By combining this pricing\\nstrategy with either an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) or Thompson Sampling (TS)\\nproduct selection approach, our algorithms achieve regret bounds of\\n$\\\\tilde{O}(d^{\\\\frac{3}{2}}\\\\sqrt{T/\\\\kappa})$ and\\n$\\\\tilde{O}(d^{2}\\\\sqrt{T/\\\\kappa})$, respectively. Finally, we validate the\\nperformance of our methods through simulations, demonstrating their\\neffectiveness.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ML\", \"categories\": \"stat.ML,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T06:56:08Z\"}"}
