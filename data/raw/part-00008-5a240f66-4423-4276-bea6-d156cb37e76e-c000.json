{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02372v1\", \"title\": \"Quantum Key Distribution over Complex Networks\", \"summary\": \"There exist several initiatives worldwide to deploy quantum key distribution\\n(QKD) over existing fibre networks and achieve quantum-safe security at large\\nscales. To understand the overall QKD network performance, it is required to\\ntransition from the analysis of individual links, as done so far, to the\\ncharacterization of the network as a whole. In this work, we undertake this\\nstudy by embedding QKD protocols on complex networks, which correctly model the\\nexisting fiber networks. We focus on networks with trusted nodes and on\\ncontinuous-variable (CV) schemes, which have much higher key rates than their\\ndiscrete-variable (DV) counterparts. In the effective CV network, however, many\\nof the unique properties of complex networks, such as small-worldness and the\\npresence of hubs, are lost due to the fast decay of the key rate with physical\\ndistance for CV systems. These properties can be restored when considering a\\nhybrid network consisting of both CV and DV protocols, achieving at the same\\ntime high average rate and inter-connectivity. Our work opens the path to the\\nstudy of QKD complex networks in existing infrastructures.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.stat-mech,physics.soc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T08:05:44Z\"}"}
