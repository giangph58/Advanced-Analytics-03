This problem features\\nseveral obstacles to its solution, which include that the posterior density is\\nnumerically intractable in continuous-time, even if the transition\\nprobabilities are available and even when one uses a time-discretization, the\\nposterior still cannot be used by adopting well-known computational methods\\nsuch as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In this paper we provide a solution to\\nthis problem by using new MCMC algorithms which can solve the afore-mentioned\\nissues. This MCMC algorithm is extended to use multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC)\\nmethods. We prove convergence bounds on our parameter estimators and show that\\nthe MLMC-based MCMC algorithm reduces the computational cost to achieve a mean\\nsquare error versus ordinary MCMC by an order of magnitude. We numerically\\nillustrate our results on two models.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.CO\", \"categories\": \"stat.CO,cs.NA,math.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T05:06:17Z\"}"}
