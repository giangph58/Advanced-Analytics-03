This\\nalgorithm uses an isomorphism of Illusie in order to compute in an adequate\\npolynomial ring. We also give an implementation of the algorithm in SageMath,\\nwhich turns out to be faster that Finotti's algorithm, which was until now the\\nmost efficient one for these operations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AC\", \"categories\": \"math.AC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:40:38Z\"}"}
