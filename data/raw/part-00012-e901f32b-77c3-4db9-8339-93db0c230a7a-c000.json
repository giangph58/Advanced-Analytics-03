Planet formation around late-type M dwarfs is of\\nparticular interest. These systems provide practical laboratories to measure\\nexoplanet occurrence rates for M dwarfs, thus testing how the outcomes of\\nplanet formation scale with host mass, and how they compare to Sun-like stars.\\nHere, we report the discovery of TOI-6478b, a cold ($T_{\\\\text{eq}}=204\\\\,$K)\\nNeptune-like planet orbiting an M5 star\\n($R_\\\\star=0.234\\\\pm0.012\\\\,\\\\text{R}_\\\\odot$,\\n$M_\\\\star=0.230\\\\pm0.007\\\\,\\\\text{M}_\\\\odot$, $T_{\\\\text{eff}}=3230\\\\pm75\\\\,$K) which\\nis a member of the Milky Way's thick disc. We measure a planet radius of\\n$R_b=4.6\\\\pm0.24\\\\,\\\\text{R}_\\\\oplus$ on a $P_b=34.005019\\\\pm0.000025\\\\,$d orbit.\\nUsing radial velocities, we calculate an upper mass limit of\\n$M_b\\\\leq9.9\\\\,\\\\text{M}_\\\\oplus$ ($M_b\\\\leq0.6\\\\,\\\\text{M}_{\\\\text{Nep}})$, with\\n$3\\\\,\\\\sigma$ confidence. TOI-6478b is a milestone planet in the study of cold,\\nNeptune-like worlds. Thanks to its large atmospheric scale height, it is\\namenable to atmospheric characterisation with facilities such as JWST, and will\\nprovide an excellent probe of atmospheric chemistry in this cold regime. It is\\none of very few transiting exoplanets that orbit beyond their system's ice-line\\nwhose atmospheric chemical composition can be measured. Based on our current\\nunderstanding of this planet, we estimate TOI-6478b's spectroscopic features\\n(in transmission) can be $\\\\sim2.5\\\\times$ as high as the widely studied planet\\nK2-18b.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:03:16Z\"}"}
