To\\naddress this problem, we developed a tactile bracelet that assists in grasping\\nby guiding the user's hand to a target object using vibration commands. Here we\\ndemonstrate the fully automated system around the bracelet, which can\\nconfidently detect and track target and distractor objects and reliably guide\\nthe user's hand. We validate our approach in three tasks that resemble complex,\\neveryday use cases. In a grasping task, the participants grasp varying target\\nobjects on a table, guided via the automated hand navigation system. In the\\nmultiple objects task, participants grasp objects from the same class,\\ndemonstrating our system's ability to track one specific object without\\ntargeting surrounding distractor objects. Finally, the participants grasp one\\nspecific target object by avoiding an obstacle along the way in the depth\\nnavigation task, showcasing the potential to utilize our system's depth\\nestimations to navigate even complex scenarios. Additionally, we demonstrate\\nthat the system can aid users in the real world by testing it in a less\\nstructured environment with a blind participant. Overall, our results\\ndemonstrate that the system, by translating the AI-processed visual inputs into\\na reduced data rate of actionable signals, enables autonomous behavior in\\neveryday environments, thus potentially increasing the quality of life of\\nvisually impaired people.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T08:24:24Z\"}"}
