{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23851v1\", \"title\": \"Revealing quantum phase string effect in doped Mott-insulator: a tensor\\n  network state approach\", \"summary\": \"We apply the fermionic tensor network (TN) state method to understand the\\nstrongly correlated nature in a doped Mott insulator. We conduct a comparative\\nstudy of the $\\\\sigma t$-$J$ model, in which the no-double-occupancy constraint\\nremains unchanged but the quantum phase string effect associated with doped\\nholes is precisely switched off. Thus, the ground state of the $\\\\sigma t$-$J$\\nmodel can serve as a well-controlled reference state of the standard $t$-$J$\\nmodel. In the absence of phase string, the spin long-range antiferromagnetic\\n(AFM) order is found to be essentially decoupled from the doped holes, and the\\nlatter contribute to a Fermi-liquid-like compressibility and a coherent\\nsingle-particle propagation with a markedly reduced pairing tendency. In\\ncontrast, our TN calculations of the $t$-$J$ model indicate that the AFM order\\ndecreases much faster with doping and the single-particle propagation of doped\\nholes gets substantially suppressed, concurrently with a much stronger charge\\ncompressibility at small doping and a significantly amplified Cooper pairing\\ntendencies. These findings demonstrate that quantum many-body interference from\\nphase strings plays a pivotal role in the $t$-$J$ model, mediating long-range\\nentanglement between spin and charge degrees of freedom.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T08:55:55Z\"}"}
