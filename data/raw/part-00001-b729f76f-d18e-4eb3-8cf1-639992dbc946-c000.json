A software framework needs to ensure real-time\\nproperties, reliable communication, and efficient resource utilization.\\nFurthermore, a software framework needs to enable seamless transition between\\ntesting stages, from simulation to small-scale to full-scale experiments. In\\nthis paper, we survey prominent software frameworks used for in-vehicle and\\ninter-vehicle communication in CAVs. We analyze these frameworks regarding\\nopportunities and challenges, such as their real-time properties and\\ntransitioning capabilities. Additionally, we delve into the tooling\\nrequirements necessary for addressing the associated challenges. We illustrate\\nthe practical implications of these challenges through case studies focusing on\\ncritical areas such as perception, motion planning, and control. Furthermore,\\nwe identify research gaps in the field, highlighting areas where further\\ninvestigation is needed to advance the development and deployment of safe and\\nefficient CAV systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MA\", \"categories\": \"cs.MA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T12:23:18Z\"}"}
