However, the\\nchallenge of implementing energy efficient nonlinearities in optics -- a key\\nrequirement for realizing neural networks -- is a conspicuous missing link. In\\nthis work we introduce a novel method to achieve nonlinear computation in fully\\nlinear media. Our method can operate at low power and requires only the ability\\nto drive the optical system at a data-dependent spatial position. Leveraging\\nthis positional encoding, we formulate a fully automated,\\ntopology-optimization-based hardware design framework for extremely specialized\\noptical neural networks, drawing on modern advancements in optimization and\\nmachine learning. We evaluate our optical designs on machine learning\\nclassification tasks: demonstrating significant improvements over linear\\nmethods, and competitive performance when compared to standard artificial\\nneural networks.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,cs.AR,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T03:55:05Z\"}"}
