{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16833v1\", \"title\": \"LRASGen: LLM-based RESTful API Specification Generation\", \"summary\": \"REpresentation State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style for designing\\nweb applications that enable scalable, stateless communication between clients\\nand servers via common HTTP techniques. Web APIs that employ the REST style are\\nknown as RESTful (or REST) APIs. When using or testing a RESTful API,\\ndevelopers may need to employ its specification, which is often defined by\\nopen-source standards such as the OpenAPI Specification (OAS). However, it can\\nbe very time-consuming and error-prone to write and update these\\nspecifications, which may negatively impact the use of RESTful APIs, especially\\nwhen the software requirements change. Many tools and methods have been\\nproposed to solve this problem, such as Respector and Swagger Core. OAS\\ngeneration can be regarded as a common text-generation task that creates a\\nformal description of API endpoints derived from the source code. A potential\\nsolution for this may involve using Large Language Models (LLMs), which have\\nstrong capabilities in both code understanding and text generation. Motivated\\nby this, we propose a novel approach for generating the OASs of RESTful APIs\\nusing LLMs: LLM-based RESTful API-Specification Generation (LRASGen). To the\\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first use of LLMs and API source code to\\ngenerate OASs for RESTful APIs. Compared with existing tools and methods,\\nLRASGen can generate the OASs, even when the implementation is incomplete (with\\npartial code, and/or missing annotations/comments, etc.). To evaluate the\\nLRASGen performance, we conducted a series of empirical studies on 20\\nreal-world RESTful APIs. The results show that two LLMs (GPT-4o mini and\\nDeepSeek V3) can both support LARSGen to generate accurate specifications, and\\nLRASGen-generated specifications cover an average of 48.85% more missed\\nentities than the developer-provided specifications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:52:50Z\"}"}
