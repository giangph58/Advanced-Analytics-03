The\\nobtained magnetic moment is in agreement with the experimental measurement and\\nthe electromagnetic radii are comparable with other model calculations. It is\\nfound that the meson cloud effect remains almost unchanged as the energy\\nbecomes high and this feature implies that the meson cloud should be considered\\nin all the energy region. Moreover, the asymptotic relations allow us to extend\\nthe electromagnetic form factors from the spacelike region to the timelike\\nregion, and then the effective form factor is almost identical with the data\\nfrom CLEO and BESIII. Finally, polarization properties of the final state\\n$\\\\Omega^-$ in the $e^+ e^- \\\\rightarrow \\\\Omega^- \\\\bar{\\\\Omega}^+$ process with\\nthe unpolarized initial states are also investigated.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex,hep-lat\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T09:37:44Z\"}"}
