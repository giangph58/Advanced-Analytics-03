In a\\npreliminary study, researchers have proved that the voice command features on\\nsuch headsets could lead to major privacy leakages. By analyzing the facial\\ndynamics captured with the motion sensors, the headsets suffer security\\nvulnerabilities revealing a user's sensitive speech without user's consent. The\\npsychography data (such as voice command features, facial dynamics, etc.) is\\nsensitive data and it should not be leaked out of the device without users\\nconsent else it is a privacy breach. To the best of our literature review, the\\nwork done in this particular research problem is very limited. Motivated from\\nthis, we develop a simple technical framework to mitigate sensitive data (or\\nbiometric data) privacy leaks in immersive technology domain. The performance\\nevaluation is conducted in a robust way using six data sets, to show that the\\nproposed solution is effective and feasible to prevent this issue.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T04:35:32Z\"}"}
