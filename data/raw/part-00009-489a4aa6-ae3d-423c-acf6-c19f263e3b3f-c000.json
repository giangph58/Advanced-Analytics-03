The framework is based on an abstract formulation of the\\nArzel\\\\`a-Ascoli theorem for uniform spaces. The result holds for a large class\\nof coagulation rate kernels, satisfying a power-law upper bound with possibly\\ndifferent singularities at small-small, small-large and large-large coalescence\\npairs. This includes in particular both mass-conserving and gelling kernels, as\\nwell as interpolation kernels used in applications. We also provide short\\nproofs of mass-conservation and gelation results for any weak solution, which\\nextends previous results for one-component systems.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T15:14:22Z\"}"}
