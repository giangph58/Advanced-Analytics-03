{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01441v1\", \"title\": \"Locally- but not Globally-identified SVARs\", \"summary\": \"This paper analyzes Structural Vector Autoregressions (SVARs) where\\nidentification of structural parameters holds locally but not globally. In this\\ncase there exists a set of isolated structural parameter points that are\\nobservationally equivalent under the imposed restrictions. Although the data do\\nnot inform us which observationally equivalent point should be selected, the\\ncommon frequentist practice is to obtain one as a maximum likelihood estimate\\nand perform impulse response analysis accordingly. For Bayesians, the lack of\\nglobal identification translates to non-vanishing sensitivity of the posterior\\nto the prior, and the multi-modal likelihood gives rise to computational\\nchallenges as posterior sampling algorithms can fail to explore all the modes.\\nThis paper overcomes these challenges by proposing novel estimation and\\ninference procedures. We characterize a class of identifying restrictions and\\ncircumstances that deliver local but non-global identification, and the\\nresulting number of observationally equivalent parameter values. We propose\\nalgorithms to exhaustively compute all admissible structural parameters given\\nreduced-form parameters and utilize them to sample from the multi-modal\\nposterior. In addition, viewing the set of observationally equivalent parameter\\npoints as the identified set, we develop Bayesian and frequentist procedures\\nfor inference on the corresponding set of impulse responses. An empirical\\nexample illustrates our proposal.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.EM\", \"categories\": \"econ.EM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T07:50:25Z\"}"}
