Higher education\\nfaces daily challenges: deep and specialized knowledge is available from\\neverywhere and accessible to almost everyone. University lecturers of\\nspecialized master courses confront the problem that their lectures are either\\ntoo boring or too complex for the attending students. Additionally, curricula\\nare changing more rapidly than they have in the past 10-30 years. The German\\neducation system comprises different educational forms, with universities\\nproviding less practical content. Consequently, many university students do not\\nobtain the practical skills they should ideally gain through university\\nlectures. Therefore, in this work, a new lecture concept is proposed based on\\nthe extension of the just-in-time teaching paradigm: Personalized and\\nDemand-Based Education. This concept includes: 1) an initial assessment of\\nstudents' backgrounds, 2) selecting the appropriate educational blocks, and 3)\\ncollecting ongoing feedback during the semester. The feedback was gathered via\\nPingo, ensuring anonymity for the students. Our concept was exemplarily tested\\nin the new lecture \\\"Practical Tools for Control Engineers\\\" at the Karlsruhe\\nInstitute of Technology. The initial results indicate that our proposed concept\\ncould be beneficial in addressing the current challenges in higher education.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.RO,cs.SY,K.3.1\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T05:34:37Z\"}"}
