Tracing wave activity from the photosphere to the corona has\\nimportant implications for coronal heating and prediction of the solar wind.\\nDespite extensive theory and simulations, the detection of waves in realistic\\nMHD simulations still presents a large challenge due to wave interaction, mode\\nconversion, and damping mechanisms. Aims. We conducted this study to detect\\nlocalised wave activity within a realistic MHD simulation of the solar\\natmosphere by the Bifrost code. Methods. We present a new method of detecting\\nthe most significant contributions of wave activity within localised areas of\\nthe domain, aided by Discrete Fourier Transforms and frequency filtering. We\\ncorrelate oscillations in the vertical & horizontal magnetic field, velocities\\nparallel & perpendicular to the magnetic field, and pressure to infer the\\nnature of the dominant wave modes. Results. Our method captures the most\\npowerful frequencies and wavenumbers, as well as providing a new diagnostic for\\ndamping processes. We infer the presence of magnetoacoustic waves in the\\nboundaries of prominent chromospheric/coronal swirling features. We find these\\nwaves are likely damped by viscous heating in the swirl boundaries,\\ncontributing to heating in the upper atmosphere. Conclusions. Using the most\\nsignificant frequencies decomposition, we highlight that energy can be\\ntransported from the lower atmosphere to the upper atmosphere through waves and\\nfluctuations along the swirl boundaries. Although further analysis is needed to\\nconfirm these findings, our new method provides a path forward to investigate\\nwave activity in the solar atmosphere\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T09:14:14Z\"}"}
