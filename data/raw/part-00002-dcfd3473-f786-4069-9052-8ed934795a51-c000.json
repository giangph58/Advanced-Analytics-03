In this paper, we\\nintroduce Text2CT, a novel approach for synthesizing 3D CT volumes from textual\\ndescriptions using the diffusion model. Unlike previous methods that rely on\\nfixed-format text input, Text2CT employs a novel prompt formulation that\\nenables generation from diverse, free-text descriptions. The proposed framework\\nencodes medical text into latent representations and decodes them into\\nhigh-resolution 3D CT scans, effectively bridging the gap between semantic text\\ninputs and detailed volumetric representations in a unified 3D framework. Our\\nmethod demonstrates superior performance in preserving anatomical fidelity and\\ncapturing intricate structures as described in the input text. Extensive\\nevaluations show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, offering\\npromising potential applications in diagnostics, and data augmentation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T15:53:56Z\"}"}
