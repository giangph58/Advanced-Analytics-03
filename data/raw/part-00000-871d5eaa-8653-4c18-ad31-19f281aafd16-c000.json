{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11126v1\", \"title\": \"KubeFence: Security Hardening of the Kubernetes Attack Surface\", \"summary\": \"Kubernetes (K8s) is widely used to orchestrate containerized applications,\\nincluding critical services in domains such as finance, healthcare, and\\ngovernment. However, its extensive and feature-rich API interface exposes a\\nbroad attack surface, making K8s vulnerable to exploits of software\\nvulnerabilities and misconfigurations. Even if K8s adopts role-based access\\ncontrol (RBAC) to manage access to K8s APIs, this approach lacks the\\ngranularity needed to protect specification attributes within API requests.\\nThis paper proposes a novel solution, KubeFence, which implements finer-grain\\nAPI filtering tailored to specific client workloads. KubeFence analyzes\\nKubernetes Operators from trusted repositories and leverages their\\nconfiguration files to restrict unnecessary features of the K8s API, to\\nmitigate misconfigurations and vulnerabilities exploitable through the K8s API.\\nThe experimental results show that KubeFence can significantly reduce the\\nattack surface and prevent attacks compared to RBAC.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T12:15:34Z\"}"}
