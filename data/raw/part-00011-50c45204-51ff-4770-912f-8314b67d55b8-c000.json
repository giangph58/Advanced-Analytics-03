However, in settings\\nwhere data arrives sequentially, these tests do not permit real-time inference,\\nas they require a pre-specified sample size T. We introduce real-time inference\\nfor program evaluation through anytime-valid rank tests. Our methodology relies\\non interpreting the absence of a treatment effect as exchangeability of the\\ntreatment estimates. We then convert these treatment estimates into sequential\\nranks, and construct optimal finite-sample valid sequential tests for\\nexchangeability. We illustrate our methods in the context of\\ndifference-in-differences and synthetic control. In simulations, they control\\nsize even under mild exchangeability violations. While our methods suffer\\nslight power loss at T, they allow for early rejection (before T) and preserve\\nthe ability to reject later (after T).\", \"main_category\": \"econ.EM\", \"categories\": \"econ.EM,stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T12:53:08Z\"}"}
