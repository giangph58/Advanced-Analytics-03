For braid matroids and\\nminimal building sets, our results produce new formulas for the Poincar\\\\'e\\npolynomial of the moduli space $\\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{0,n+1}$ of pointed\\nstable rational curves, and recover several previous results by Keel, Getzler,\\nManin, and Aluffi--Marcolli--Nascimento. We also use our methods to produce\\nexamples of matroids and building sets for which the corresponding Chow ring\\nhas Hilbert series with non-log-concave coefficients. This contrasts with the\\nreal-rootedness and log-concavity conjectures of Ferroni--Schr\\\\\\\"oter for\\nmatroids with maximal building sets, and of Aluffi--Chen--Marcolli for braid\\nmatroids with minimal building sets.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T14:49:10Z\"}"}
