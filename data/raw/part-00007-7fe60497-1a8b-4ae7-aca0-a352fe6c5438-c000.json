However, the\\nuniversal utility of this field often hinders the possibility of having a\\ngeneralized theory that accommodates every scenario. This tradeoff is better\\nreflected through the lens of dependence, a central piece behind the\\ntheoretical and applied developments of multiple testing. Although omnipresent\\nin many scientific avenues, the nature and extent of dependence vary\\nsubstantially with the context and complexity of the particular scenario.\\nPositive dependence is the norm in testing many treatments versus a single\\ncontrol or in spatial statistics. On the contrary, negative dependence arises\\nnaturally in tests based on split samples and in cyclical, ordered comparisons.\\nIn GWAS, the SNP markers are generally considered to be weakly dependent.\\nGeneralized familywise error rate (k-FWER) control has been one of the\\nprominent frequentist approaches in simultaneous inference. However, the\\nperformances of k-FWER controlling procedures are yet unexplored under\\ndifferent dependencies. This paper revisits the classical testing problem of\\nnormal means in different correlated frameworks. We establish upper bounds on\\nthe generalized familywise error rates under each dependence, consequently\\ngiving rise to improved testing procedures. Towards this, we present improved\\nprobability inequalities, which are of independent theoretical interest\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.ME,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:35:34Z\"}"}
