{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19692v1\", \"title\": \"All-Optical Doubly Resonant Cavities for ReLU Function in Nanophotonic\\n  Deep Learning\", \"summary\": \"We present a novel approach to implementing all-optical Rectified Linear Unit\\n(ReLU) activation functions using compact doubly-resonant cavities with\\ndimensions of approximately $10\\\\,\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{m}$. Our design leverages\\n$\\\\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinear processes within carefully engineered photonic\\nstructures that simultaneously resonate at both fundamental and second-harmonic\\nfrequencies. By exploiting the phase-sensitive nature of second-harmonic\\ngeneration, we demonstrate an optical analog to the ReLU function, achieving\\nfemtojoule-level activation energy-comparable to state-of-the-art\\napproaches-while reducing device footprint by two orders of magnitude compared\\nto previous implementations. We develop the theoretical framework using\\ncoupled-mode theory and validate it through rigorous finite-difference\\ntime-domain simulations. Beyond ReLU, we show that the same physical structure\\ncan implement alternative activation functions such as ELU and GELU through\\nsimple adjustments to input conditions. Neural network simulations demonstrate\\nthat our proposed optical activation functions achieve classification accuracy\\nwithin $0.4\\\\%$ of ideal electronic implementations while offering significant\\nadvantages in energy efficiency and processing speed. This work represents a\\nsignificant advancement toward realizing energy-efficient, high-density optical\\nneural networks for next-generation artificial intelligence hardware.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T11:41:52Z\"}"}
