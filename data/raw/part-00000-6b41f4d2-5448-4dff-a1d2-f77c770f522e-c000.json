{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01397v1\", \"title\": \"Can the poltergeist mechanism produce observable GWs?\", \"summary\": \"The enhancement of induced gravitational waves (GWs) occurs due to a sudden\\ntransition from an early matter-dominated era to the radiation-dominated era.\\nWe analyze the impact of the transition rate on the scalar potential. We find\\nthat the finite transition duration suppresses the oscillation amplitude of the\\nscalar potential, consequently suppressing the amplitude of the GW energy\\nspectrum. By numerically solving the background and perturbation equations, we\\ndemonstrate that the physically motivated models, such as the evaporation of\\nprimordial black holes and the decay of Q-balls, cannot produce an observable\\nGW signal.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T06:37:17Z\"}"}
