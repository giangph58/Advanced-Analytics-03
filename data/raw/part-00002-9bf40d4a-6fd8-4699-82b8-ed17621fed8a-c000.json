The wide, low-redshift coverage\\nof J-PAS and the high-density, high-redshift mapping of PFS are strongly\\ncomplementary: combining the two reduces marginalized uncertainties on all\\nprimary parameters compared with either survey individually. Adding the joint\\nJ-PAS+PFS data to next-generation CMB measurements from CMB-S4 and\\n\\\\textsc{LiteBird} yields an expected precision of $\\\\sigma(\\\\sum\\nm_\\\\nu)=0.017\\\\,$eV in the $\\\\Lambda$CDM$+\\\\sum m_\\\\nu+N_{\\\\rm eff}$ framework,\\nsufficient to disfavour the inverted neutrino hierarchy at $2.35\\\\,\\\\sigma$ if\\nthe true mass sum equals the normal-ordering minimum. Motivated by recent DESI\\nresults, we also forecast within a $w_0w_a$CDM$+\\\\sum m_\\\\nu+N_{\\\\rm eff}$\\ncosmology, adopting the DESI\\\\,DR2 best-fit values ($w_0=-0.758$, $w_a=-0.82$)\\nas fiducial. The combination CMB+J-PAS+PFS then delivers $\\\\sigma(w_0)=0.044$\\nand $\\\\sigma(w_a)=0.18$, corresponding to a $5.1\\\\,\\\\sigma$ preference for a\\ntime-varying dark-energy equation of state. These findings show that J-PAS and\\nPFS, especially when coupled with Stage-IV CMB observations, will provide\\ncompetitive tests of neutrino physics and the dynamics of cosmic acceleration.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T09:26:27Z\"}"}
