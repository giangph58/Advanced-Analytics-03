{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16644v1\", \"title\": \"A Systematic Review of Common Beginner Programming Mistakes in Data\\n  Engineering\", \"summary\": \"The design of effective programming languages, libraries, frameworks, tools,\\nand platforms for data engineering strongly depends on their ease and\\ncorrectness of use. Anyone who ignores that it is humans who use these tools\\nrisks building tools that are useless, or worse, harmful. To ensure our data\\nengineering tools are based on solid foundations, we performed a systematic\\nreview of common programming mistakes in data engineering. We focus on\\nprogramming beginners (students) by analyzing both the limited literature\\nspecific to data engineering mistakes and general programming mistakes in\\nlanguages commonly used in data engineering (Python, SQL, Java). Through\\nanalysis of 21 publications spanning from 2003 to 2024, we synthesized these\\ncomplementary sources into a comprehensive classification that captures both\\ngeneral programming challenges and domain-specific data engineering mistakes.\\nThis classification provides an empirical foundation for future tool\\ndevelopment and educational strategies. We believe our systematic\\ncategorization will help researchers, practitioners, and educators better\\nunderstand and address the challenges faced by novice data engineers.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T12:04:09Z\"}"}
