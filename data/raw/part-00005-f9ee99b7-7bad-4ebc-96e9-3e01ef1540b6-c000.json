Solution of\\nthis equation is a probability measure that stands for spatial distribution of\\nparticles. The paper is concerned with stabilization of this solution in the\\ncase of controlled dynamic. By generalizing methods used control-Lyapunov\\nfunction to the case of Wasserstein spaces, we construct a feedback strategy\\nthat provides local stabilization, i.e. leads the trajectory to a small\\nneighbourhood of stabilization target. Based on this strategy, we construct a\\nfeedback that makes global stabilization, i.e. leads the trajectory infinitely\\nclose to stabilization target.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T11:48:09Z\"}"}
