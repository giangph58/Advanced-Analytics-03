{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12188v1\", \"title\": \"Nonequilibrium physics of brain dynamics\", \"summary\": \"Information processing in the brain is coordinated by the dynamic activity of\\nneurons and neural populations at a range of spatiotemporal scales. These\\ndynamics, captured in the form of electrophysiological recordings and\\nneuroimaging, show evidence of time-irreversibility and broken detailed balance\\nsuggesting that the brain operates in a nonequilibrium stationary state.\\nFurthermore, the level of nonequilibrium, measured by entropy production or\\nirreversibility appears to be a crucial signature of cognitive complexity and\\nconsciousness. The subsequent study of neural dynamics from the perspective of\\nnonequilibrium statistical physics is an emergent field that challenges the\\nassumptions of symmetry and maximum-entropy that are common in traditional\\nmodels. In this review, we discuss the plethora of exciting results emerging at\\nthe interface of nonequilibrium dynamics and neuroscience. We begin with an\\nintroduction to the mathematical paradigms necessary to understand\\nnonequilibrium dynamics in both continuous and discrete state-spaces. Next, we\\nreview both model-free and model-based approaches to analysing nonequilibrium\\ndynamics in both continuous-state recordings and neural spike-trains, as well\\nas the results of such analyses. We briefly consider the topic of\\nnonequilibrium computation in neural systems, before concluding with a\\ndiscussion and outlook on the field.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.NC\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.NC,cond-mat.dis-nn,cond-mat.stat-mech,math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T15:43:35Z\"}"}
