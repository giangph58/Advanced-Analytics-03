However, progress in detecting X-ray or\\ngamma-ray emission and absorption lines in GRB spectra has been relatively\\nslow, only the narrow emission line feature of about 10 MeV found in GRB\\n221009A has exhibited a significance exceeding $5 \\\\sigma$. Here, we report the\\nprobable evidence of a narrow emission feature at about 2.1 mega-electron volts\\n(MeV) in the spectrum of GRB 221023A. The highest statistical significance of\\nthis feature is observed in the time interval between 8 and 30 seconds after\\nFermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor trigger, with the chance probability value $<2.56\\n\\\\times 10^{-5}$ (after accounting for the look-elsewhere effect), corresponding\\nto a Gaussian-equivalent significance $> 4.20 \\\\sigma$. We interpret this\\nfeature as being generated through the de-excitation of excited electrons in\\nthe relativistic hydrogen-like high-atomic-number ions entrained in the GRB\\njet.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T15:24:59Z\"}"}
