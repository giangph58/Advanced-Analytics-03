{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19963v1\", \"title\": \"Stochastic Subspace via Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis for\\n  Characterizing Model Error\", \"summary\": \"This paper proposes a probabilistic model of subspaces based on the\\nprobabilistic principal component analysis (PCA). Given a sample of vectors in\\nthe embedding space -- commonly known as a snapshot matrix -- this method uses\\nquantities derived from the probabilistic PCA to construct distributions of the\\nsample matrix, as well as the principal subspaces. It is applicable to\\nprojection-based reduced-order modeling methods, such as proper orthogonal\\ndecomposition and related model reduction methods. The stochastic subspace thus\\nconstructed can be used, for example, to characterize model-form uncertainty in\\ncomputational mechanics. The proposed method has multiple desirable properties:\\n(1) it is naturally justified by the probabilistic PCA and has analytic forms\\nfor the induced random matrix models; (2) it satisfies linear constraints, such\\nas boundary conditions of all kinds, by default; (3) it has only one\\nhyperparameter, which significantly simplifies training; and (4) its algorithm\\nis very easy to implement. We compare the proposed method with existing\\napproaches in a low-dimensional visualization example and a parametric static\\nproblem, and demonstrate its performance in a dynamics model of a space\\nstructure.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CE\", \"categories\": \"cs.CE,math.ST,physics.comp-ph,physics.data-an,stat.ME,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:35:01Z\"}"}
