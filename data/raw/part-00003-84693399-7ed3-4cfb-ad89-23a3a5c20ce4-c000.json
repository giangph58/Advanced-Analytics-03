A promising application scenario of this method is distributed\\naverage consensus in wireless multi-agent systems. However, in such scenario,\\nnon-coherent interference from concurrent OTA transmissions can introduce bias\\nin the consensus value. To address this issue, we develop a robust distributed\\naverage consensus algorithm by formulating the consensus problem as a\\ndistributed optimization problem. Using decentralized projected gradient\\ndescent (D-PGD), our proposed algorithm can achieve unbiased mean square\\naverage consensus even in the presence of non-coherent interference and noise.\\nAdditionally, we implement transmit power control and receive scaling\\nmechanisms to further accelerate convergence. Simulation results demonstrate\\nthat our method can significantly enhance the convergence speed of the D-PGD\\nalgorithm for OTA average consensus without compromising accuracy.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,cs.SY,eess.SP,eess.SY,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T07:03:02Z\"}"}
