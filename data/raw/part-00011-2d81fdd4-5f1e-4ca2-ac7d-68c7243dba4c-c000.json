We consider two\\ntypes of controllers: (i) a state feedback controller with feed-forward\\nreference input and (ii) an augmented feedback controller with error\\nintegration. The first controller features a simpler structure and is easier to\\ndesign, while the second offers improved performance in the presence of system\\nparameter changes and disturbances. Our design strategy employs state-input\\ndatasets to construct data-based representations of the closed-loop dynamics.\\nSince these representations involve linear threshold functions, we rewrite them\\nas switched linear systems, and formulate the design problem as that of finding\\na common controller for all the resulting modes. This gives rise to a set of\\nlinear matrix inequalities (LMIs) whose solutions corresponds to the controller\\ngain matrices. We analyze the computational complexity of solving the LMIs and\\npropose a simplified, sufficient set of conditions that scales linearly with\\nthe system state. Simulations on two case studies involving regulation of\\nfiring rate dynamics in rodent brains and of arousal level dynamics in humans\\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the controller designs.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:21:47Z\"}"}
