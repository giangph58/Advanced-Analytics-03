AlgOS offers numerous features:\\nintegration with Optuna for automated hyperparameter tuning; automated argument\\nparsing for generic command-line interfaces; automated registration of new\\nclasses; and a centralised database for logging experiments and studies. These\\nfeatures are designed to reduce the overhead of implementing new algorithms and\\nto standardise the comparison of algorithms. The standardisation of algorithmic\\nimplementations is crucial for reproducibility and reliability in research.\\nAlgOS combines Abstract Syntax Trees with a novel implementation of the\\nObserver pattern to control the logical flow of algorithmic segments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T10:36:46Z\"}"}
