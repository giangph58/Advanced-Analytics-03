{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10386v1\", \"title\": \"Universal fault-tolerant logic with heterogeneous holographic codes\", \"summary\": \"The study of holographic bulk-boundary dualities has led to the construction\\nof novel quantum error correcting codes. Although these codes have shed new\\nlight on conceptual aspects of these dualities, they have widely been believed\\nto lack a crucial feature of practical quantum error correction: The ability to\\nsupport universal fault-tolerant quantum logic. In this work, we introduce a\\nnew class of holographic codes that realize this feature. These heterogeneous\\nholographic codes are constructed by combining two seed codes in a tensor\\nnetwork on an alternating hyperbolic tiling. We show how this construction\\ngeneralizes previous strategies for fault tolerance in tree-type concatenated\\ncodes, allowing one to implement non-Clifford gates fault-tolerantly on the\\nholographic boundary. We also demonstrate that these codes allow for high\\nerasure thresholds under a suitable heterogeneous combination of specific seed\\ncodes. Compared to previous concatenated codes, heterogeneous holographic codes\\nachieve large overhead savings in physical qubits, e.g., a $21.8\\\\%$ reduction\\nfor a two-layer Steane/quantum Reed-Muller combination. Unlike standard\\nconcatenated codes, we establish that the new codes can encode more than a\\nsingle logical qubit per code block by applying ``black hole'' deformations\\nwith tunable rate and distance, while possessing fully addressable, universal\\nfault-tolerant gate sets. Therefore, our work strengthens the case for the\\nutility of holographic quantum codes for practical quantum computing.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:28:33Z\"}"}
