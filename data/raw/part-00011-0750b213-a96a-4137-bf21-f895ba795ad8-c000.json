{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20768v1\", \"title\": \"LakeVilla: Multi-Table Transactions for Lakehouses\", \"summary\": \"Data lakehouses (LHs) are at the core of current cloud analytics stacks by\\nproviding elastic, relational compute on data in cloud data lakes across\\nvendors. For relational semantics, they rely on open table formats (OTFs).\\nUnfortunately, they have many missing features inherent to their metadata\\ndesigns, like no support for multi-table transactions and recovery in case of\\nan abort in concurrent, multi-query workloads. This, in turn, can lead to\\nnon-repeatable reads, stale data, and high costs in productive cloud systems.\\nIn this work, we introduce LakeVilla, a complementary solution that introduces\\nrecovery, multi-query/table transactions, and transaction isolation to\\nstate-of-the-art OTFs like Apache Iceberg and Delta Lake tables. We investigate\\nits transactional guarantees and show it has minimal impact on performance (2%\\nYCSB writes, 2.5% TPC-DS reads) and provides concurrency control for multiple\\nreaders and writers for arbitrary long transactions in OTFs in a non-invasive\\nway.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DB\", \"categories\": \"cs.DB\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:47:53Z\"}"}
