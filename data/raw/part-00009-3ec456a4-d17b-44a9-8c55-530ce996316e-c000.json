Both the seasonal regime shifts in\\nthe state dynamics and the players' heterogeneous preferences are introduced\\ninto the model. The strategies under cooperative, noncooperative and partially\\ncooperative scenarios are obtained by utilizing the Pontryagin's Maximum\\nPrinciple. Under all feasible coalition structures, the convergence of the\\nstate variable is proved. A new sustainably--cooperative optimality principle\\nis proposed according to the coalition structures, which belongs to the\\nimputation set. The prerequisite for the existence of time-consistency in the\\nsustainably-cooperative optimality principle is explicitly obtained. The\\nseasonal imputation distribution procedure (IDP) is designed to maintain the\\ntime-consistentcy (dynamic stability) of cooperation over time.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T13:11:21Z\"}"}
