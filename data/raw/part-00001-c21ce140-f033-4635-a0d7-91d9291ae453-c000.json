{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09906v1\", \"title\": \"Plasticity-Aware Mixture of Experts for Learning Under QoE Shifts in\\n  Adaptive Video Streaming\", \"summary\": \"Adaptive video streaming systems are designed to optimize Quality of\\nExperience (QoE) and, in turn, enhance user satisfaction. However, differences\\nin user profiles and video content lead to different weights for QoE factors,\\nresulting in user-specific QoE functions and, thus, varying optimization\\nobjectives. This variability poses significant challenges for neural networks,\\nas they often struggle to generalize under evolving targets - a phenomenon\\nknown as plasticity loss that prevents conventional models from adapting\\neffectively to changing optimization objectives. To address this limitation, we\\npropose the Plasticity-Aware Mixture of Experts (PA-MoE), a novel learning\\nframework that dynamically modulates network plasticity by balancing memory\\nretention with selective forgetting. In particular, PA-MoE leverages noise\\ninjection to promote the selective forgetting of outdated knowledge, thereby\\nendowing neural networks with enhanced adaptive capabilities. In addition, we\\npresent a rigorous theoretical analysis of PA-MoE by deriving a regret bound\\nthat quantifies its learning performance. Experimental evaluations demonstrate\\nthat PA-MoE achieves a 45.5% improvement in QoE over competitive baselines in\\ndynamic streaming environments. Further analysis reveals that the model\\neffectively mitigates plasticity loss by optimizing neuron utilization.\\nFinally, a parameter sensitivity study is performed by injecting varying levels\\nof noise, and the results align closely with our theoretical predictions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MM\", \"categories\": \"cs.MM,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T06:02:41Z\"}"}
