{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05242v1\", \"title\": \"Enhancing Treatment Effect Estimation via Active Learning: A\\n  Counterfactual Covering Perspective\", \"summary\": \"Although numerous complex algorithms for treatment effect estimation have\\nbeen developed in recent years, their effectiveness remains limited when\\nhandling insufficiently labeled training sets due to the high cost of labeling\\nthe effect after treatment, e.g., expensive tumor imaging or biopsy procedures\\nneeded to evaluate treatment effects. Therefore, it becomes essential to\\nactively incorporate more high-quality labeled data, all while adhering to a\\nconstrained labeling budget. To enable data-efficient treatment effect\\nestimation, we formalize the problem through rigorous theoretical analysis\\nwithin the active learning context, where the derived key measures --\\n\\\\textit{factual} and \\\\textit{counterfactual covering radius} determine the risk\\nupper bound. To reduce the bound, we propose a greedy radius reduction\\nalgorithm, which excels under an idealized, balanced data distribution. To\\ngeneralize to more realistic data distributions, we further propose FCCM, which\\ntransforms the optimization objective into the \\\\textit{Factual} and\\n\\\\textit{Counterfactual Coverage Maximization} to ensure effective radius\\nreduction during data acquisition. Furthermore, benchmarking FCCM against other\\nbaselines demonstrates its superiority across both fully synthetic and\\nsemi-synthetic datasets.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:42:00Z\"}"}
