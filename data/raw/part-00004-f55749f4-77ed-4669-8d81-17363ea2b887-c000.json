This\\ncharacteristic serves as the impetus for the quantum computing paradigm that\\nutilizes Choi states as information sources. In this work, the fundamental\\ntheorems regarding quantum channel capacity are proven when Choi states are\\nconsidered as sources. This achievement enriches the set of capacities\\nassociated with quantum channels. Moreover, it gives rise to novel\\nopportunities for the comprehension of superadditivity phenomena and the\\ndiscovery of new classes of quantum error-correction codes.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T06:58:25Z\"}"}
