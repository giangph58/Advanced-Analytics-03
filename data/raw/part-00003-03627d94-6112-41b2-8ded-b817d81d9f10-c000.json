{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16687v1\", \"title\": \"Non-uniqueness of (Stochastic) Lagrangian Trajectories for Euler\\n  Equations\", \"summary\": \"We are concerned with the (stochastic) Lagrangian trajectories associated\\nwith Euler or Navier-Stokes equations. First, we construct solutions to the 3D\\nEuler equations which dissipate kinetic energy with $C_{t,x}^{1/3-}$\\nregularity, such that the associated Lagrangian trajectories are not unique.\\nThe proof is based on the non-uniqueness of positive solutions to the\\ncorresponding transport equations, in conjunction with the superposition\\nprinciple. Second, in dimension $d\\\\geq2$, for any\\n$1<p<2,\\\\frac{1}{p}+\\\\frac{1}{s}>1+\\\\frac1d$, we construct solutions to the Euler\\nor Navier-Stokes equations in the space $C_tL^p\\\\cap L_t^1W^{1,s}$,\\ndemonstrating that the associated (stochastic) Lagrangian trajectories are not\\nunique. Our result is sharp in 2D in the sense that: (1) in the stochastic\\ncase, for any vector field $v\\\\in C_tL^p$ with $p>2$, the associated stochastic\\nLagrangian trajectory associated with $v$ is unique (see \\\\cite{KR05}); (2) in\\nthe deterministic case, the LPS condition guarantees that for any weak solution\\n$v\\\\in C_tL^p$ with $p>2$ to the Navier-Stokes equations, the associated\\n(deterministic) Lagrangian trajectory is unique. Our result is also sharp in\\ndimension $d\\\\geq2$ in the sense that for any divergence-free vector field $v\\\\in\\nL_t^1W^{1,s}$ with $s>d$, the associated (deterministic) Lagrangian trajectory\\nis unique (see \\\\cite{CC21}).\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math-ph,math.MP,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T13:16:04Z\"}"}
