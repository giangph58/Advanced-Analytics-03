{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14973v1\", \"title\": \"Ultra-diffuse galaxies in the EAGLE simulation\", \"summary\": \"We use the highest-resolution EAGLE simulation, Recal-L025N0752, to study the\\nproperties and formation of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). We identify 181 UDGs\\nand find their properties closely match observations. The total masses of EAGLE\\nUDGs range from ${\\\\sim}5\\\\times 10^{8}~M_{\\\\odot}$ to ${\\\\sim}2\\\\times\\n10^{11}~M_{\\\\odot}$, indicating that they are dwarf galaxies rather than failed\\n$L_\\\\star$ galaxies. EAGLE UDGs are not a distinct population, but rather a\\nsubset of dwarf galaxies, as their properties generally form a continuous\\ndistribution with those of normal dwarf galaxies. Unlike the situations in\\nprevious studies, the extended sizes of field UDGs in EAGLE are not driven by\\nhigh halos spin or by supernova-induced stellar expansion, but instead largely\\narise from high spins in their star-forming gas and thus the newly formed stars\\nat large radii. This might be attributed to galactic fountains, by which\\nstar-forming gas are launched to large halo-centric distances and acquire\\nadditional angular momentum through interactions with the circumgalactic\\nmedium.For satellite UDGs, ${\\\\sim} 60 \\\\%$ of them were already UDGs before\\nfalling into the host galaxy, while the remaining ${\\\\sim} 40\\\\%$ were normal\\ngalaxies prior to infall and subsequently transformed into UDGs due to tidal\\neffects after infall.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T09:00:01Z\"}"}
