However, gathering constant feedback throughout\\nthe design process can be labor-intensive and disruptive. We explore how AI can\\nbridge this gap by providing effortless, ambient feedback. We introduce\\nFeedQUAC, a design companion that delivers real-time AI-generated commentary\\nfrom a variety of perspectives through different personas. A design probe study\\nwith eight participants highlights how designers can leverage quick yet ambient\\nAI feedback to enhance their creative workflows. Participants highlight\\nbenefits such as convenience, playfulness, confidence boost, and inspiration\\nfrom this lightweight feedback agent, while suggesting additional features,\\nlike chat interaction and context curation. We discuss the role of AI feedback,\\nits strengths and limitations, and how to integrate it into existing design\\nworkflows while balancing user involvement. Our findings also suggest that\\nambient interaction is a valuable consideration for both the design and\\nevaluation of future creativity support systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.AI,cs.CY,cs.MM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T04:48:00Z\"}"}
