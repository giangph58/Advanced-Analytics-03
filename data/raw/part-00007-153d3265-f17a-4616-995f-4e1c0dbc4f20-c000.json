{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06981v1\", \"title\": \"LCL Resonance Analysis and Damping in Single-Loop Grid-Forming Wind\\n  Turbines\", \"summary\": \"A dynamic phenomenon known as LCL resonance is often neglected when stability\\nanalysis is carried out for grid-forming (GFM) control schemes by wind turbine\\nsystems, due to its high frequency. This paper shows that this simplification\\nis not always valid for single-loop (SL) control schemes. A detailed\\nsmall-signal analysis reveals that reactive power (RAP) control significantly\\ninfluences the resonant modes, which may be dominant in determining overall\\nsystem stability, even if the resonant frequency is high. The underlying\\nmechanism via which the LCL resonance may dominate the overall system stability\\nis systematically analyzed. Furthermore, various RAP control strategies are\\ncompared to assess their different effects on resonant modes. An active damping\\n(AD) strategy favorable for SL-GFM control is then designed. We also provide a\\ncomparison between SL-GFM and well-studied grid-following control schemes,\\nhighlighting quite different resonance features between them. Finally, case\\nstudies associated with a 14-bus, 5-machine IEEE test system are presented.\\nThese show that instability originates from the LCL resonance rather than\\nlow-frequency interactions among multiple machines, validating the theoretical\\nanalysis and the proposed AD strategy.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T15:37:02Z\"}"}
