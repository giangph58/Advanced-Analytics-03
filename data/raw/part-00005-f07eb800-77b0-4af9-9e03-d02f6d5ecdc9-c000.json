{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05129v1\", \"title\": \"Bulldozing an immersed granular material in a confined channel\", \"summary\": \"The motion of an immersed granular material in a channel is characterised by\\ncomplex interactions among the grains, between the grains and the permeating\\nliquid, and between the grains and the channel walls. Here, we develop a\\nreduced-order continuum model for the bulldozing of an immersed, sedimented\\ngranular material by a piston in a channel. In our continuum approach, the\\ngranular pile and the overlying fluid layer evolve as a system of coupled thin\\nfilms. We model the granular phase as a dense, porous, visco-plastic material\\nthat experiences Coulomb-like friction with the walls. Conservation of mass and\\nmomentum under a thin-film approximation leads to an elliptic equation for the\\nvelocity of the grains that is coupled with an evolution equation for the\\nheight of the granular pile. We solve our model numerically for a variety of\\ndifferent scenarios to explore the interactions between wall friction, internal\\nviscous-like stresses, and fluid flow above and through the pile. We complement\\nour numerical results with a series of experiments that provide insight into\\nthe validity and limitations of the model.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T11:05:18Z\"}"}
