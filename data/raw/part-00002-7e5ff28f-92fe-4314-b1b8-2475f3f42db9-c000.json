{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03632v1\", \"title\": \"The role of friction forces in arterial mechanical thrombectomy: a\\n  review\", \"summary\": \"Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated the superiority of mechanical\\nthrombectomy (MT) in treating acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Stent retriever (SR)\\nand aspiration techniques are the standard methods for removing occluded\\nemboli, with evolving technologies improving MT efficiency. However, procedural\\nsuccess remains uncertain. Frictional forces, specifically clot-vessel,\\nclot-SR, and SR-vessel interactions, play a critical role in MT outcomes. This\\nreview examines frictional forces during MT and their impact on success,\\nanalyzing publications from 2015 to 2025. We focus on studies that calculated\\nfriction or retrieval forces using in vitro models. We have also included\\ncurrent trends, limitations, and future perspectives on studying and\\nunderstanding frictional forces and their implementation into in silico models.\\nFindings indicate that fibrin-rich clots are more difficult to retrieve than\\nred blood cell (RBC)-rich clots due to their higher friction coefficient, three\\nto four times greater, an observation supported by multiple studies. SR-vessel\\nand SR-clot friction also influence MT effectiveness. SR-vessel interaction\\nplays a crucial role in acutely curved vessels, as SR compression reduces its\\nefficiency. In SR-clot interaction, RBC-rich clot fragmentation is linked to\\nrelative interaction forces. In summary, obtaining in vivo frictional values\\nremains challenging, and inconsistencies persist in past in vitro studies.\\nFurther, a deeper understanding of frictional forces is essential for\\noptimizing MT, improving current SRs, and developing next-generation\\nthrombectomy technologies.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.med-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.med-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:31:09Z\"}"}
