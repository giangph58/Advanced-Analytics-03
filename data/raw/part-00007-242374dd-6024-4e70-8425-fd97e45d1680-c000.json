We derive this power law analytically for the\\nsecond-order even gravitational perturbations, demonstrating that it is\\ndetermined by the fact that the second-order source decays as the inverse\\nsquare of the distance. Quadratic gravitational modes with multipole $\\\\ell$\\ndecay according to a law $\\\\sim t^{-2\\\\ell-1}$, in contrast to the linear Price\\nlaw scaling $\\\\sim t^{-2\\\\ell-3}$. Consequently, nonlinear tails may persist\\nlonger than their linear counterparts.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.CO,hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T17:12:28Z\"}"}
