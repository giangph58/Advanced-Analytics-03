{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19548v1\", \"title\": \"Further examples of apodictic discourse, I\", \"summary\": \"The analysis of problematic mathematical texts, particularly from India, has\\nrequired the introduction of a new category of rigorous discourse, apodictic\\ndiscourse. We briefly recall why this introduction was necessary. We then show\\nthat this form of discourse is widespread among scholars, even in contemporary\\nMathematics, in India and elsewhere. It is in India a natural outgrowth of the\\nemphasis on non-written communication, combined with the need for freedom of\\nthought. New results in this first part include the following: (i)\\n{\\\\=A}ryabha___a proposed a geometric derivation of a basic algebraic identity;\\n(ii) Brahmagupta proposed an original argument for the irrationality of\\nquadratic surds on the basis of his results on the varga-prak___ti problem,\\nthereby justifying his change in the definition of the word kara___{\\\\=i}.\", \"main_category\": \"math.HO\", \"categories\": \"math.HO,math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T07:52:25Z\"}"}
