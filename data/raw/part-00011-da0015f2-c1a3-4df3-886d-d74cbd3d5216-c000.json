Constructing this model involves estimating a set of parameters,\\nwhich, in the worst case, may scale exponentially with the number of qubits. In\\nthis paper, we introduce a method called spacetime noise inversion, revealing\\nthat unbiased quantum error mitigation can be achieved with just a single\\naccurately measured error parameter and a sampler of Pauli errors. The error\\nsampler can be efficiently implemented in conjunction with quantum error\\ncorrection. We provide rigorous analyses of bias and cost, showing that the\\ncost of measuring the parameter and sampling errors is low -- comparable to the\\ncost of the computation itself. Moreover, our method is robust to the\\nfluctuation of error parameters, a limitation of unbiased quantum error\\nmitigation in practice. These findings highlight the potential of integrating\\nquantum error mitigation with error correction as a promising approach to\\nsuppress computational errors in the early fault-tolerant era.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T11:42:34Z\"}"}
