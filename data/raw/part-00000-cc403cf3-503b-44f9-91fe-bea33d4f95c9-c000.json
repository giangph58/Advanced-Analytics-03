{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05211v1\", \"title\": \"Incentive-Aware Machine Learning; Robustness, Fairness, Improvement &\\n  Causality\", \"summary\": \"The article explores the emerging domain of incentive-aware machine learning\\n(ML), which focuses on algorithmic decision-making in contexts where\\nindividuals can strategically modify their inputs to influence outcomes. It\\ncategorizes the research into three perspectives: robustness, aiming to design\\nmodels resilient to \\\"gaming\\\"; fairness, analyzing the societal impacts of such\\nsystems; and improvement/causality, recognizing situations where strategic\\nactions lead to genuine personal or societal improvement. The paper introduces\\na unified framework encapsulating models for these perspectives, including\\noffline, online, and causal settings, and highlights key challenges such as\\ndifferentiating between gaming and improvement and addressing heterogeneity\\namong agents. By synthesizing findings from diverse works, we outline\\ntheoretical advancements and practical solutions for robust, fair, and\\ncausally-informed incentive-aware ML systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GT\", \"categories\": \"cs.GT,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:04:32Z\"}"}
