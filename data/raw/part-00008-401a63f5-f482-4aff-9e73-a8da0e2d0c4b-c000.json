The human driver is not replaced\\none-to-one by a technical system - only a limited set of cognitive functions\\nare replaced. However, performance in the most challenging function, obstacle\\ndetection, is difficult to quantify due to the deficiency of published\\nmeasurement results. This article summarizes the data published so far. This\\narticle also goes a long way to remedy this situation by providing a new public\\nand anonymized dataset of 711 train driver performance measurements from\\ncontrolled experiments. The measurements are made for different speeds,\\nobstacle sizes, train protection systems and obstacle color contrasts\\nrespectively. The measured values are reaction time and distance to the\\nobstacle. The goal of this paper is an unbiased and exhaustive description of\\nthe presented dataset for research, standardization and regulation.
