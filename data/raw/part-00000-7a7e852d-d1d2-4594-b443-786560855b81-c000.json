Most studies have been\\ncarried out on maps (discrete-time systems). We analyse a scenario of global\\nchanges of the structure of an attractor in continuous-time systems leading to\\nan unbounded growth of the topological entropy of the underlying dynamical\\nsystem. As an example, we consider the classical Roessler system. We show that\\nfor an explicit range of parameters a chaotic attractor exists. We also prove\\nthe existence of a sequence of bifurcations leading to the growth of the\\ntopological entropy. The proofs are computer-aided.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS,cs.NA,math.NA,nlin.CD\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T09:54:10Z\"}"}
