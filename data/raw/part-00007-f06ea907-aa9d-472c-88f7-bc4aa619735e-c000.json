The\\nfKP equation is derived from a three-fluid-Poisson model of the dusty plasma\\nusing the reductive perturbation technique and numerically solved for\\nparameters close to the experimental investigations of cylindrical precursor\\nsolitons. The fKP model solutions show excellent agreement with the\\nexperimental results in reproducing the prominent geometric features of the\\ntwo-dimensional solitons and closely matching the quantitative values of their\\nvelocities, amplitudes, and temporal evolutions. Our findings suggest that the\\nfKP equation can serve as a very realistic model to investigate the dynamics of\\nprecursor solitons and can be usefully employed in practical applications such\\nas space debris detection and tracking techniques that are based on\\nobserving/predicting nonlinear plasma excitations induced by the debris in the\\nionosphere.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T13:43:03Z\"}"}
