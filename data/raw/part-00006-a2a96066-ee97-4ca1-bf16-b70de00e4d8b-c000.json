However, the resolution of existing multipath component (MPC)\\nangle estimation methods is constrained by the DSS angle sampling interval.\\nTherefore, this communication proposes a high-resolution MPC angle estimation\\nmethod based on power-angle-delay profile (PADP) for DSS. By exploiting the\\nmapping relationship between the power difference of adjacent angles in the\\nPADP and MPC offset angle, the resolution of MPC angle estimation is refined,\\nsignificantly enhancing the accuracy of MPC angle and amplitude estimation\\nwithout increasing measurement complexity. Numerical simulation results\\ndemonstrate that the proposed method reduces the mean squared estimation errors\\nof angle and amplitude by one order of magnitude compared to traditional\\nomnidirectional synthesis methods. Furthermore, the estimation errors approach\\nthe Cram\\\\'er-Rao Lower Bounds (CRLBs) derived for wideband DSS, thereby\\nvalidating its superior performance in MPC angle and amplitude estimation.\\nFinally, experiments conducted in an indoor scenario at 37.5 GHz validate the\\nexcellent performance of the proposed method in practical applications.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T06:56:34Z\"}"}
