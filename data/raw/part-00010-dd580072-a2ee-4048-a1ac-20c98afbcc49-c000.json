{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12675v1\", \"title\": \"Physics Informed Constrained Learning of Dynamics from Static Data\", \"summary\": \"A physics-informed neural network (PINN) models the dynamics of a system by\\nintegrating the governing physical laws into the architecture of a neural\\nnetwork. By enforcing physical laws as constraints, PINN overcomes challenges\\nwith data scarsity and potentially high dimensionality. Existing PINN\\nframeworks rely on fully observed time-course data, the acquisition of which\\ncould be prohibitive for many systems. In this study, we developed a new PINN\\nlearning paradigm, namely Constrained Learning, that enables the approximation\\nof first-order derivatives or motions using non-time course or partially\\nobserved data. Computational principles and a general mathematical formulation\\nof Constrained Learning were developed. We further introduced MPOCtrL (Message\\nPassing Optimization-based Constrained Learning) an optimization approach\\ntailored for the Constrained Learning framework that strives to balance the\\nfitting of physical models and observed data. Its code is available at github\\nlink: https://github.com/ptdang1001/MPOCtrL Experiments on synthetic and\\nreal-world data demonstrated that MPOCtrL can effectively detect the nonlinear\\ndependency between observed data and the underlying physical properties of the\\nsystem. In particular, on the task of metabolic flux analysis, MPOCtrL\\noutperforms all existing data-driven flux estimators.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,physics.bio-ph,q-bio.MN\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T06:06:53Z\"}"}
