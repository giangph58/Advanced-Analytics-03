The system is defined by a free-evolution\\nLindbladian superoperator, which contains the free Hamiltonian and naturally\\noccurring decoherence terms, as well as the control superoperators. The\\nperformance metric for optimization is the fidelity between the projector onto\\nthe code space and the same projector after Lindbladian evolution for a\\nspecified time. We use a gradient-based search to update the code words,\\ninduced decay matrix and control Hamiltonian matrix. We apply the method to\\noptimize AQEC codes for a variety of few-level systems. The four-level system\\nwith uniform decay rates offers a simple example for testing and illustrating\\nthe operation of our approach. The algorithm reliably succeeds in finding the\\noptimal code in this case, while success becomes probabilistic for more\\ncomplicated cases. For a five-level system with photon loss decay, the\\nalgorithm finds good AQEC codes, but these codes are not as good as the\\nwell-known binomial code. We use the binomial code as a starting point to\\nsearch for the optimal code for a perturbed five-level system. In this case,\\nthe algorithm finds a code that is better than both the original binomial code\\nand any other code obtained numerically when starting from a random initial\\nguess.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T12:56:10Z\"}"}
