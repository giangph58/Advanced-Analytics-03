Training on live infrastructure\\nposes significant risks to organizations, making secure, isolated cyber ranges\\nan essential tool for conducting Red vs. Blue Team training events. These\\nevents enable security teams to refine their skills without impacting\\noperational environments. While such training provides a strong foundation, the\\never-evolving nature of cyber threats necessitates additional support for\\neffective defense. To address this challenge, we introduce CyberAlly, a\\nknowledge graph-enhanced AI assistant designed to enhance the efficiency and\\neffectiveness of Blue Teams during incident response. Integrated into our cyber\\nrange alongside an open-source SIEM platform, CyberAlly monitors alerts, tracks\\nBlue Team actions, and suggests tailored mitigation recommendations based on\\ninsights from prior Red vs. Blue Team exercises. This demonstration highlights\\nthe feasibility and impact of CyberAlly in augmenting incident response and\\nequipping defenders to tackle evolving threats with greater precision and\\nconfidence.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T05:03:56Z\"}"}
