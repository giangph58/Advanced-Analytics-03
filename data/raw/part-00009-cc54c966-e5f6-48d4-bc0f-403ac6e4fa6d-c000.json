{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17787v1\", \"title\": \"The Fourth Monocular Depth Estimation Challenge\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents the results of the fourth edition of the Monocular Depth\\nEstimation Challenge (MDEC), which focuses on zero-shot generalization to the\\nSYNS-Patches benchmark, a dataset featuring challenging environments in both\\nnatural and indoor settings. In this edition, we revised the evaluation\\nprotocol to use least-squares alignment with two degrees of freedom to support\\ndisparity and affine-invariant predictions. We also revised the baselines and\\nincluded popular off-the-shelf methods: Depth Anything v2 and Marigold. The\\nchallenge received a total of 24 submissions that outperformed the baselines on\\nthe test set; 10 of these included a report describing their approach, with\\nmost leading methods relying on affine-invariant predictions. The challenge\\nwinners improved the 3D F-Score over the previous edition's best result,\\nraising it from 22.58% to 23.05%.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T17:59:52Z\"}"}
