{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17667v1\", \"title\": \"Spectral Irradiance Variability in Lyman-Alpha Emission During Solar\\n  Flares\", \"summary\": \"The Lyman-alpha (Ly{\\\\alpha};1216 {\\\\AA}) line is the brightest emission line\\nin the quiescent solar spectrum and radiates a significant fraction of the\\navailable nonthermal energy during flares. Despite its importance, there is a\\nlack of detailed studies of Ly{\\\\alpha} spectral variability during flares.\\nRecently, spectrally resolved Ly{\\\\alpha} flare observations from the\\nSORCE/SOLSTICE instrument have become available. This study examines Ly{\\\\alpha}\\nspectral variability and its relationship with HXR emission from nonthermal\\nelectrons, using observations of two M-class flares from SORCE/SOLSTICE and\\nRHESSI. Imaging observations from STEREO/SECCHI EUVI and SDO/AIA provide\\nfurther context. Enhancements across the Ly{\\\\alpha} line profile were found to\\nclosely correlate with bursts of HXR emission, suggesting a primarily\\nnonthermal origin. Red enhancement asymmetries at the peak of each flare were\\nattributed to chromospheric evaporation, while blue wing enhancement and blue\\nasymmetry were linked to a bright filament-eruption seen in SDO/AIA 1600 {\\\\AA}\\nimages. These findings contribute to the understanding of spectral Ly{\\\\alpha}\\nvariability during flares and highlight the need for future studies using a\\nhigher quality and quantity of spectral Ly{\\\\alpha} flare observations. Such\\nstudies will further characterise the physical mechanisms driving Ly{\\\\alpha}\\nflare variability.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:36:53Z\"}"}
