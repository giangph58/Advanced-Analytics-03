First,\\nwe establish an impossibility result by proving that server-side local\\nprocesses cannot decrease quantum communication requirements of secure\\ndelegation protocols. We develop no-go results that prohibit such processes\\nwithin an information theoretic framework. Second, we present a possibility\\nresult by introducing Selectively Blind Quantum Computing (SBQC), a novel\\nfunctionality that allows the client to hide one among a known set of possible\\ncomputations. We characterize how differences between computations in the\\nprotected set influence the number of qubits sent during our SBQC\\nimplementation, yielding a communication-optimal protocol. This approach\\nreduces qubit communication drastically and demonstrates the trade-off between\\ninformation leaked to the server and communication cost.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:36:00Z\"}"}
