Although a rich range of single-particle\\nNH physics has been uncovered, many-body phenomena in strongly correlated NH\\nsystems have been far less well studied. The Kondo effect, an important\\nparadigm for strong correlation physics, has recently been considered in the NH\\nsetting. Here we develop a NH generalization of the numerical renormalization\\ngroup (NRG) and use it to solve the NH Kondo model. Our non-perturbative\\nsolution applies beyond weak coupling, and we uncover a nontrivial phase\\ndiagram. The method is showcased by application to the NH pseudogap Kondo\\nmodel, which we show supports a completely novel phase with a genuine NH stable\\nfixed point and complex eigenspectrum. Our NH-NRG code, which can be used in\\nregimes and for models inaccessible to, e.g., perturbative scaling and Bethe\\nansatz, is provided open source.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T16:34:49Z\"}"}
