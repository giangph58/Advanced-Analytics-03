{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19938v1\", \"title\": \"Mesh-Learner: Texturing Mesh with Spherical Harmonics\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we present a 3D reconstruction and rendering framework termed\\nMesh-Learner that is natively compatible with traditional rasterization\\npipelines. It integrates mesh and spherical harmonic (SH) texture (i.e.,\\ntexture filled with SH coefficients) into the learning process to learn each\\nmesh s view-dependent radiance end-to-end. Images are rendered by interpolating\\nsurrounding SH Texels at each pixel s sampling point using a novel\\ninterpolation method. Conversely, gradients from each pixel are back-propagated\\nto the related SH Texels in SH textures. Mesh-Learner exploits graphic features\\nof rasterization pipeline (texture sampling, deferred rendering) to render,\\nwhich makes Mesh-Learner naturally compatible with tools (e.g., Blender) and\\ntasks (e.g., 3D reconstruction, scene rendering, reinforcement learning for\\nrobotics) that are based on rasterization pipelines. Our system can train vast,\\nunlimited scenes because we transfer only the SH textures within the frustum to\\nthe GPU for training. At other times, the SH textures are stored in CPU RAM,\\nwhich results in moderate GPU memory usage. The rendering results on\\ninterpolation and extrapolation sequences in the Replica and FAST-LIVO2\\ndatasets achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing\\nstate-of-the-art methods (e.g., 3D Gaussian Splatting and M2-Mapping). To\\nbenefit the society, the code will be available at\\nhttps://github.com/hku-mars/Mesh-Learner.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:09:25Z\"}"}
