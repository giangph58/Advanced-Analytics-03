At the same time, their security has\\nincreasingly been acknowledged as a problem. To this end, the paper examines\\nthe previously overlooked longitudinal aspects of software ecosystem security,\\nfocusing on malware uploaded to six popular programming language ecosystems.\\nThe dataset examined is based on the new Open Source Vulnerabilities (OSV)\\ndatabase. According to the results, records about detected malware uploads in\\nthe database have recently surpassed those addressing vulnerabilities in\\npackages distributed in the ecosystems. In the early 2025 even up to 80% of all\\nentries in the OSV have been about malware. Regarding time series analysis of\\nmalware frequencies and their shares to all database entries, good predictions\\nare available already by relatively simple autoregressive models using the\\nnumbers of ecosystems, security advisories, and media and other articles as\\npredictors. With these results and the accompanying discussion, the paper\\nimproves and advances the understanding of the thus far overlooked longitudinal\\naspects of ecosystems and malware.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T08:27:22Z\"}"}
