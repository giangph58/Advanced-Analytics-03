{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16570v1\", \"title\": \"CountingDINO: A Training-free Pipeline for Class-Agnostic Counting using\\n  Unsupervised Backbones\", \"summary\": \"Class-agnostic counting (CAC) aims to estimate the number of objects in\\nimages without being restricted to predefined categories. However, while\\ncurrent exemplar-based CAC methods offer flexibility at inference time, they\\nstill rely heavily on labeled data for training, which limits scalability and\\ngeneralization to many downstream use cases. In this paper, we introduce\\nCountingDINO, the first training-free exemplar-based CAC framework that\\nexploits a fully unsupervised feature extractor. Specifically, our approach\\nemploys self-supervised vision-only backbones to extract object-aware features,\\nand it eliminates the need for annotated data throughout the entire proposed\\npipeline. At inference time, we extract latent object prototypes via ROI-Align\\nfrom DINO features and use them as convolutional kernels to generate similarity\\nmaps. These are then transformed into density maps through a simple yet\\neffective normalization scheme. We evaluate our approach on the FSC-147\\nbenchmark, where we outperform a baseline under the same label-free setting.\\nOur method also achieves competitive -- and in some cases superior -- results\\ncompared to training-free approaches relying on supervised backbones, as well\\nas several fully supervised state-of-the-art methods. This demonstrates that\\ntraining-free CAC can be both scalable and competitive.
