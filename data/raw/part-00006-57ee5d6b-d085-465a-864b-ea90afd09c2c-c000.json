While many voices\\nhighlight the importance of ethical engagement, less attention has been paid to\\nthe conditions that make such engagement possible. In this article, I argue\\nthat technological understanding is a foundational capacity for meaningful\\nethical reflection on emerging technology like quantum technologies. Drawing on\\nDe Jong & De Haro's account of technological understanding (2025a; 2025b), I\\nclarify what such understanding entails and how it enables ethical enquiry. I\\ncontend that ethical assessment, first and foremost, requires an understanding\\nof what quantum technologies can do - their functional capacities and, by\\nextension, their potential applications. Current efforts to build engagement\\ncapacities among broader audiences - within and beyond academic contexts -\\ntend, however, to focus on explaining the underlying quantum mechanics.\\nInstead, I advocate a shift from a physics-first to a functions-first approach:\\nfostering an understanding of quantum technologies' capabilities as the basis\\nfor ethical reflection. Presenting technological understanding as an epistemic\\nrequirement for meaningful ethical engagement may appear to raise the bar for\\nparticipation. However, by decoupling functional understanding from technical\\nexpertise, this condition becomes attainable for a broader group, contributing\\nnot only to a well-informed but also to a more inclusive ethical debate.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T12:38:45Z\"}"}
