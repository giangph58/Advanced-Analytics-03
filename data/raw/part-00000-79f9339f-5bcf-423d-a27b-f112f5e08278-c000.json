{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17440v1\", \"title\": \"Generating Localized Audible Zones Using a Single-Channel Parametric\\n  Loudspeaker\", \"summary\": \"Advanced sound zone control (SZC) techniques typically rely on massive\\nmulti-channel loudspeaker arrays to create high-contrast personal sound zones,\\nmaking single-loudspeaker SZC seem impossible. In this Letter, we challenge\\nthis paradigm by introducing the multi-carrier parametric loudspeaker (MCPL),\\nwhich enables SZC using only a single loudspeaker. In our approach, distinct\\naudio signals are modulated onto separate ultrasonic carrier waves at different\\nfrequencies and combined into a single composite signal. This signal is emitted\\nby a single-channel ultrasonic transducer, and through nonlinear demodulation\\nin air, the audio signals interact to virtually form multi-channel outputs.\\nThis novel capability allows the application of existing SZC algorithms\\noriginally designed for multi-channel loudspeaker arrays. Simulations validate\\nthe effectiveness of our proposed single-channel MCPL, demonstrating its\\npotential as a promising alternative to traditional multi-loudspeaker systems\\nfor achieving high-contrast SZC. Our work opens new avenues for simplifying SZC\\nsystems without compromising performance.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.AS\", \"categories\": \"eess.AS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T11:02:07Z\"}"}
