Truncated Toeplitz operators have been\\neffectively used to solve the inverse spectral problem when the spectral\\nmeasure is a locally finite periodic measure (see \\\\cite{MP}). Here, we reverse\\nthe inverse problem algorithm to solve the direct spectral problem for\\nstep-function Hamiltonians. For a non-step-function Hamiltonian, we consider\\nits step-function approximations and their corresponding spectral measures, and\\nshow that these spectral measures converge to the spectral measure of the\\noriginal Hamiltonian.\", \"main_category\": \"math.SP\", \"categories\": \"math.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T17:20:13Z\"}"}
