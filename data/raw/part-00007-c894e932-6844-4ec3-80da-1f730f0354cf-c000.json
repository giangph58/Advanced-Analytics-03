{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11118v1\", \"title\": \"Revealing Covert Attention by Analyzing Human and Reinforcement Learning\\n  Agent Gameplay\", \"summary\": \"This study introduces a novel method for revealing human covert attention\\npatterns using gameplay data alone, utilizing offline attention techniques from\\nreinforcement learning (RL). We propose the contextualized, task-relevant (CTR)\\nattention network, which generates attention maps from both human and RL agent\\ngameplay in Atari environments. These maps are sparse yet retain the necessary\\ninformation for the current player's decision making. We compare the\\nCTR-derived attention maps with a temporally integrated overt attention (TIOA)\\nmodel based on eye-tracking data, serving as a point of comparison and\\ndiscussion. Visual inspection reveals distinct attention patterns: human CTR\\nmaps focus on the player and rather nearby opponents, occasionally shifting\\nbetween stronger focus and broader views - sometimes even attending to empty\\nspace ahead. In contrast, agent maps maintain a consistent broad focus on most\\nobjects, including distant ones and the player. Quantitative analysis further\\ndemonstrates that human CTR maps align more closely with TIOA than agent maps\\ndo. Our findings indicate that the CTR attention network can effectively reveal\\nhuman covert attention patterns from gameplay alone, without the need for\\nadditional data like brain activity recordings. This work contributes to\\nunderstanding human-agent attention differences and enables the development of\\nRL agents augmented with human covert attention.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T12:07:14Z\"}"}
