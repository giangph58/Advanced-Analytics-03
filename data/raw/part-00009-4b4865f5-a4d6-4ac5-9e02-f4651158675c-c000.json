Guided by\\nKoszul duality theory, we consider the graded Lie algebra of coderivations of\\nthe cofree conilpotent graded cocommutative cotrialgebra generated by $V$. We\\nshow that in the case of $V$ being a shift of an ungraded vector space $W$,\\nMaurer-Cartan elements of this graded Lie algebra are exactly post-Lie algebra\\nstructures on $W$. The cohomology of a post-Lie algebra is then defined using\\nMaurer-Cartan twisting. The second cohomology group of a post-Lie algebra has a\\nfamiliar interpretation as equivalence classes of infinitesimal deformations.\\nNext we define a post-Lie$_\\\\infty$ algebra structure on a graded vector space\\nto be a Maurer-Cartan element of the aforementioned graded Lie algebra.\\nPost-Lie$_\\\\infty$ algebras admit a useful characterization in terms of\\n$L_\\\\infty$-actions (or open-closed homotopy Lie algebras). Finally, we\\nintroduce the notion of homotopy Rota-Baxter operators on open-closed homotopy\\nLie algebras and show that certain homotopy Rota-Baxter operators induce\\npost-Lie$_\\\\infty$ algebras.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RA\", \"categories\": \"math.RA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:18:50Z\"}"}
