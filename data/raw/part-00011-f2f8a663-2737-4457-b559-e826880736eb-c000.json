While the Markovian approximation simplifies\\nthe analysis of noise, it remains computationally demanding, particularly for\\nhigh-dimensional systems like quantum memories. In this paper, we present a\\nstatistical approach to study the impact of different noise models on\\nentanglement in composite quantum systems. By comparing global and local noise\\nscenarios, we quantify entanglement degradation using the Positive Partial\\nTranspose Time (PPTT) metric, which measures how long entanglement persists\\nunder noise. When the sampling of different noise scenarios is performed under\\ncontrolled and homogeneous conditions, our analysis reveals that systems\\nsubjected to global noise tend to exhibit longer PPTTs, whereas those\\ninfluenced by independent local noise models display the shortest entanglement\\npersistence. To carry out this analysis, we employ a computational method\\nproposed by Cao and Lu, which accelerates the simulation of PPTT distributions\\nand enables efficient analysis of systems with dimensions up to $D=8$. Our\\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for investigating the\\nresilience of quantum systems under Markovian noise.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T17:21:39Z\"}"}
