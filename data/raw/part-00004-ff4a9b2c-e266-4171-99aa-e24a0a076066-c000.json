{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07078v1\", \"title\": \"Detecting AI-generated Artwork\", \"summary\": \"The high efficiency and quality of artwork generated by Artificial\\nIntelligence (AI) has created new concerns and challenges for human artists. In\\nparticular, recent improvements in generative AI have made it difficult for\\npeople to distinguish between human-generated and AI-generated art. In this\\nresearch, we consider the potential utility of various types of Machine\\nLearning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models in distinguishing AI-generated\\nartwork from human-generated artwork. We focus on three challenging artistic\\nstyles, namely, baroque, cubism, and expressionism. The learning models we test\\nare Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer\\nPerceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our best experimental\\nresults yield a multiclass accuracy of 0.8208 over six classes, and an\\nimpressive accuracy of 0.9758 for the binary classification problem of\\ndistinguishing AI-generated from human-generated art.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T17:50:07Z\"}"}
