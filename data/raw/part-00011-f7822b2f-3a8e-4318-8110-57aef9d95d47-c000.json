{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12877v1\", \"title\": \"Market-Driven Flexibility Provision: A Tri-Level Optimization Approach\\n  for Carbon Reduction\", \"summary\": \"The integration of renewable energy resources (RES) in the power grid can\\nreduce carbon intensity, but also presents certain challenges. The uncertainty\\nand intermittent nature of RES emphasize the need for flexibility in power\\nsystems. Moreover, there are noticeable mismatches between real-time\\nelectricity prices and carbon intensity patterns throughout the day. These\\ndiscrepancies may lead customers to schedule energy-intensive tasks during the\\nearly hours of the day, a period characterized by lower electricity prices but\\nhigher carbon intensity. This paper introduces a novel and comprehensive\\nframework aimed at encouraging customer participation in electricity markets\\nand aligning their flexibility with carbon intensity trends. The proposed\\napproach integrates an incentive-based tariff with a tri-level optimization\\nmodel, where customers are motivated to submit flexibility bids and, in return,\\nreceive financial rewards based on their contributions. The tri-level model\\nensures a dynamic interaction between the market operation platform (MOP) and\\nend-users. Simulations are performed on a modified IEEE-33 bus system,\\nsupported by two scenarios with different RES generations and customer\\nbehaviors. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in\\nguiding the customers' consumption behaviors towards low carbon intensity.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T12:04:49Z\"}"}
