Here, we develop a general MLIP by leveraging the graph neural\\nnetwork-based MACE architecture and active-learning strategies to accurately\\ncapture vibrational dynamics across a range of polyacene-based molecular\\ncrystals, namely naphthalene, anthracene, tetracene and pentacene. Through\\ncareful error propagation, we show that these potentials are accurate and\\nenable the study of anharmonic vibrational features, vibrational lifetimes, and\\nvibrational coupling. In particular, we investigate large-scale host-guest\\nsystems based on these molecular crystals, showing the capacity of\\nmolecular-dynamics-based techniques to explain and quantify vibrational\\ncoupling between host and guest nuclear motion. Our results establish a\\nframework for understanding vibrational signatures in large-scale complex\\nmolecular systems and thus represent an important step for engineering\\nvibrational interactions in molecular environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:27:21Z\"}"}
