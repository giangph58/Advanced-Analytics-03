These estimates\\nprovide a deeper insight into the underlying dynamics of the system,\\nfacilitating the identification of particle behaviors and the detection of\\nchanges in diffusion states. However, analyzing short and noisy video data,\\nwhich often yield incomplete and heterogeneous trajectories, poses a\\nsignificant challenge for traditional statistical approaches. We introduce a\\ndata-driven method that integrates particle tracking, an attention\\n  U-Net architecture, and a change-point detection algorithm to address these\\nissues. This approach not only infers the anomalous diffusion parameters with\\nhigh accuracy but also identifies temporal transitions between different\\nstates, even in the presence of noise and limited temporal resolution. Our\\nmethodology demonstrated strong performance in the 2nd Anomalous Diffusion\\n(AnDi) Challenge benchmark within the top submissions for video tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T17:08:17Z\"}"}
