A natural algorithm to\\nachieve this is the edge-averaging process, where edges are repeatedly selected\\nat random (according to independent Poisson clocks) and the opinions on the\\nnodes of each selected edge are replaced by their average. The effectiveness of\\nthis algorithm is determined by its convergence rate. It is known that on a\\nfinite graph of $n$ nodes, the opinions reach approximate consensus in\\npolynomial time. We prove that the convergence is much faster when the initial\\nopinions are disordered (independent identically distributed): the time to\\nreach approximate consensus is $O (\\\\log^2n)$, and this bound is sharp. For\\ninfinite graphs, we show that for every $p\\\\geq 1$, if the initial opinions are\\nin $L^p$, then the opinion at each vertex converges to the mean in $L^p$, and\\nif $p>4$, then almost sure convergence holds as well.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:12:55Z\"}"}
