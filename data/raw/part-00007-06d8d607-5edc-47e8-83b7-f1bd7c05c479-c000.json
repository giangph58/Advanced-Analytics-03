The multi-layer\\nstructure can be designed by nesting complementary negative and regular\\nmaterials together, and it can be easily achieved by truncating bulk metallic\\nmaterial in a specific configuration. Using layer potentials and symmetrization\\ntechniques, we establish the perturbation formula in terms of\\nNeumann-Poincar\\\\'e (NP) operator for general multi-layered medium, and obtain\\nthe spectral properties of the NP operator, which demonstrates that the number\\nof plasmon modes increases with the number of layers. Based on Fourier series,\\nwe present an exact matrix representation of the NP operator in an apparently\\nunsymmetrical structure, exemplified by multi-layer confocal ellipses. By\\nhighly intricate and delicate analysis, we establish a handy algebraic\\nframework for studying the splitting of the plasmon modes within multi-layer\\nstructures. Moreover, the asymptotic profiles of the plasmon modes are also\\nobtained. This framework helps reveal the effects of material truncation and\\nrotational symmetry breaking on the splitting of the plasmon modes, thereby\\ninducing desired resonances and enabling the realization of customized\\napplications.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:35:27Z\"}"}
