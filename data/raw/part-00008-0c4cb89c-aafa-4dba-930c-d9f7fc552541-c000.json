{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04935v1\", \"title\": \"Real-Time Model Predictive Control of Vehicles with Convex-Polygon-Aware\\n  Collision Avoidance in Tight Spaces\", \"summary\": \"This paper proposes vehicle motion planning methods with obstacle avoidance\\nin tight spaces by incorporating polygonal approximations of both the vehicle\\nand obstacles into a model predictive control (MPC) framework. Representing\\nthese shapes is crucial for navigation in tight spaces to ensure accurate\\ncollision detection. However, incorporating polygonal approximations leads to\\ndisjunctive OR constraints in the MPC formulation, which require a mixed\\ninteger programming and cause significant computational cost. To overcome this,\\nwe propose two different collision-avoidance constraints that reformulate the\\ndisjunctive OR constraints as tractable conjunctive AND constraints: (1) a\\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM)-based formulation that recasts collision avoidance\\nas a SVM optimization problem, and (2) a Minimum Signed Distance to Edges\\n(MSDE) formulation that leverages minimum signed-distance metrics. We validate\\nboth methods through extensive simulations, including tight-space parking\\nscenarios and varied-shape obstacle courses, as well as hardware experiments on\\nan RC-car platform. Our results demonstrate that the SVM-based approach\\nachieves superior navigation accuracy in constrained environments; the MSDE\\napproach, by contrast, runs in real time with only a modest reduction in\\ncollision-avoidance performance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T04:26:07Z\"}"}
