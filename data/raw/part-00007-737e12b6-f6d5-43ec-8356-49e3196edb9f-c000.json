{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07772v1\", \"title\": \"Extremum Seeking Boundary Control for Euler-Bernoulli Beam PDEs\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents the design and analysis of an extremum seeking (ES)\\ncontroller for scalar static maps in the context of infinite-dimensional\\ndynamics governed by the 1D Euler-Bernoulli (EB) beam Partial Differential\\nEquation (PDE). The beam is actuated at one end (using position and moment\\nactuators). The map's input is the displacement at the beam's uncontrolled end,\\nwhich is subject to a sliding boundary condition. Notably, ES for this class of\\nPDEs remains unexplored in the existing literature. To compensate for PDE\\nactuation dynamics, we employ a boundary control law via a backstepping\\ntransformation and averaging-based estimates for the gradient and Hessian of\\nthe static map to be optimized. This compensation controller leverages a\\nSchr\\\\\\\"odinger equation representation of the EB beam and adapts existing\\nbackstepping designs to stabilize the beam. Using the semigroup and averaging\\ntheory in infinite dimensions, we prove local exponential convergence to a\\nsmall neighborhood of the unknown optimal point. Finally, simulations\\nillustrate the effectiveness of the design in optimizing the unknown static\\nmap.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:12:17Z\"}"}
