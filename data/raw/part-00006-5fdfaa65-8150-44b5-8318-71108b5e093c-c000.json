To describe the alignment, we use order\\nparameters in terms of the distribution function of the kinetic model. For the\\nconstant noise case, we study the well-posedness of the VMFP equation on the\\ntorus. Based on regularity, we show that the phenomenon of phase transition is\\nonly related to the ratio between the strengths of noise and coupling. In\\nparticular, for the low-noise case, we derive an exponential convergence to the\\nvon-Mises type equilibrium, which shows a strong evidence for the nematic\\nalignment. The multiplicative noise is also studied to obtain a non-symmetric\\nequilibrium with two different peaks on the torus.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T09:09:24Z\"}"}
