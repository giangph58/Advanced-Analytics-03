{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15693v1\", \"title\": \"A study of two Ramsey numbers involving odd cycles\", \"summary\": \"For any two graphs $G$ and $H$, the \\\\emph{Ramsey number} $R(G,H)$ is the\\nminimum integer $n$ such that any graph on $n$ vertices either contains a copy\\nof $G$ or its complement contains a copy of $H$ as a subgraph. The \\\\emph{book\\ngraph} of order $(n+2)$ denoted by $B_{n}$ is the graph with $n$ distinct\\ncopies of triangles sharing a common edge called the `base'. A cycle of order\\n$m$ is denoted by $C_{m}$. For any two positive integers $n$ and $m$, the value\\nof $R(B_{n},C_{m})$ is still unknown, if $n\\\\in [ \\\\frac{9m}{8}-125, 4m-14]$. In\\nthis article, we have obtained a bound of $R(B_{n}, C_{m})$, if $n\\\\in [2m-3,\\n4m-14]$ and $m\\\\geq 7$ is an odd. This is an improvement on an earlier result. A\\nconnected graph $G$ is said to be \\\\emph{$H$-good} if the formula,\\n\\\\begin{equation*} R(G,H)= (|G|-1)(\\\\chi(H)-1)+\\\\sigma(H) \\\\end{equation*} holds,\\nwhere $\\\\chi(H)$ is the chromatic number of $H$ and $\\\\sigma(H)$ is the size of\\nthe smallest colour class for the $\\\\chi(H)$-colouring. In this article, we have\\nstudied the \\\\emph{Ramsey goodness} of the graph pair $(C_{m},\\n\\\\mathbb{K}_{2,n})$, where $\\\\mathbb{K}_{2,n}$ is the complete biparite graph. We\\nhave obtained an exact value of $R(\\\\mathbb{K}_{2,n},C_{m})$, which shows that\\n$\\\\mathbb{K}_{2,n}$ is $C_{m}$-good if $n\\\\geq 2m+499$ is an integer and $m\\\\geq\\n7$ is an odd integer. This extends a previous result on the Ramsey goodness of\\n$(C_{m}, \\\\mathbb{K}_{2,n})$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T08:20:48Z\"}"}
