{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15781v1\", \"title\": \"Interacting Immediate Neighbour Interpolation for Geoscientific Data\", \"summary\": \"A diverse range of interpolation methods, including Kriging, spline/minimum\\ncurvature and radial basis function interpolation exist for interpolating\\nspatially incomplete geoscientific data. Such methods use various spatial\\nproperties of the observed data to infer its local and global behaviour. In\\nthis study, we exploit the adaptability of locally interacting systems from\\nstatistical physics and develop an interpolation framework for numerical\\ngeoscientific data called Interacting Immediate Neighbour Interpolation (IINI),\\nwhich solely relies on local and immediate neighbour correlations. In the IINI\\nmethod, medium-to-long range correlations are constructed from the collective\\nlocal interactions of grid centroids. To demonstrate the functionality and\\nstrengths of IINI, we apply our methodology to the interpolation of ground\\ngravity, airborne magnetic and airborne radiometric datasets. We further\\ncompare the performance of IINI to conventional methods such as minimum\\ncurvature surface fitting. Results show that IINI is competitive with\\nconventional interpolation techniques in terms of validation accuracy, while\\nbeing significantly simpler in terms of algorithmic complexity and data\\npre-processing requirements. IINI demonstrates the broader applicability of\\nstatistical physics concepts within the field of geostatistics, highlighting\\ntheir potential to enrich and expand traditional geostatistical methods.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,physics.geo-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T10:45:58Z\"}"}
