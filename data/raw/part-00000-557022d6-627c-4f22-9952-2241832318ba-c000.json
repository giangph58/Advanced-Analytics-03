We\\ndiscuss four case studies where we used FRET to capture the system's\\nrequirements. These formalised requirements subsequently guided the case study\\nspecifications in a combination of formal paradigms. For each case study we\\nsummarise insights gained during this process, exploring the expressiveness and\\nthe potential interoperability of these approaches. Our experience confirms\\nFRET's suitability as a framework for the elicitation and understanding of\\nrequirements and for providing traceability from requirements to specification.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:03:34Z\"}"}
