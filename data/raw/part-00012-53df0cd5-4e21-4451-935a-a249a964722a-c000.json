Strikingly, the recent introduction\\nof higher-order topological insulators has generalized the fundamental\\nframework of topological photonics, endowing counterintuitive strong\\nconfinement of light at lower-dimensional boundaries, thus unlocking exciting\\nprospects for the exploration of topological phenomena in fresh routes as well\\nas the design of topology-driven nanoscale light sources. Here, we revealed the\\nphotonic quadrupole topological phases can be activated by defect evolution and\\nperformed experimental demonstrations of associated nanoscale lasing operation\\nunder this paradigm. The quadrupole higher-order topological nanocavity is\\nconstructed by two topologically distinct photonic crystal slabs with opposite\\ndirections of defect evolution. Stable single mode emission and low lasing\\nthreshold in telecom C-band are achieved at room temperature of the\\ndefect-evolved quadrupole topological nanolaser. This work reveals new\\npossibilities for photonic quadrupole topological phase transition, providing\\nan intriguing route toward light confinement and modulation under the\\ntopological framework.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:06:37Z\"}"}
