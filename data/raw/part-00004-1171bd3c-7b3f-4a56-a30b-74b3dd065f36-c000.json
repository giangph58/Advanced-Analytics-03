This work presents a static, spherically symmetric\\nspacetime metric which produces stable circular orbits whose speed approaches a\\nconstant value at high radii. The orbital speed is independent of the mass\\ncontained within the orbital radius, however, there is pressure throughout the\\nspacetime. The stress energy tensor of this metric is evaluated numerically\\nusing the mass of the Milky Way's central black hole, the orbital speed of its\\ndistant satellites, and three different values of a unitless 'mass tuning'\\nparameter B. These B 'tune' the amount of mass present, without violating the\\nWeak Energy Condition (WEC) at any evaluated spacetime point. The metric can be\\nmerged with a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric, in which case it achieves\\nisotropy and obeys the Friedmann equations at cosmological distances.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T03:50:23Z\"}"}
