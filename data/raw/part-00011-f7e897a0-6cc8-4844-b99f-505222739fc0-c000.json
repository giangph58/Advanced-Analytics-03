Frobenius's method is a classical technique for\\nconstructing logarithmic series solutions of differential equations by\\nperturbing exponents of generic series solutions. We show that all\\n$A$-hypergeometric series solutions can be obtained via this method.\\n  Building upon our prior studies, we develop a duality framework between\\nformal power series and differential operators, introduce minimal vectors with\\nrespect to a generic weight, and establish key results on logarithmic\\ncoefficients of $A$-hypergeometric series. We extend Frobenius's method and\\nprove its sufficiency in constructing all $A$-hypergeometric series solutions.\\nFurthermore, we explore conditions under which the Frobenius method developed\\nin our previous studies suffices and we pose an open question on the necessity\\nof the extended one.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T11:28:04Z\"}"}
