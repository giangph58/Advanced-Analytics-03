Here we show to the contrary that nonlocality based\\non N00N states already for $N=2$ has an exceptionally high robustness to photon\\nloss. For the dominant noise factor, single photon loss in the transmission\\nchannels, we can certify noise robustness up to 10\\\\% loss, while for a\\nrealistic noise model we use neural network-based heuristics to observe $\\\\sim\\n50\\\\%$ robustness. Moreover we show that the robustness holds even for imperfect\\nsources based on SPDC sources, where the heralding information of the sources\\ncan be used to avoid any global post-processing of the outcomes, such as\\ndiscarding rounds when photons fail to arrive, and thus demonstrate how the\\ndetection loophole in the triangle network can be closed.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:31:34Z\"}"}
