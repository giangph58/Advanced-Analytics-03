We achieve this by\\nestablishing a direct connection to a Loschmidt echo (LE) type measurement\\nsequence, applicable to quantum many-body systems. Notably, our approach does\\nnot rely on random-noise averaging, a feature that can be extended to protocols\\nto measure out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs), as we demonstrate.\\nBy way of example, we show that our protocols can be practically implemented in\\nsuperconducting qubit-based platforms, as well as in cavity-QED trapped\\nultra-cold gases.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.quant-gas,cond-mat.stat-mech,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T16:21:53Z\"}"}
