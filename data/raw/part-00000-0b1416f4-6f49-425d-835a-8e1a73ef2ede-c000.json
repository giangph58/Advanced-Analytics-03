{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03569v1\", \"title\": \"Corner Cases: How Size and Position of Objects Challenge\\n  ImageNet-Trained Models\", \"summary\": \"Backgrounds in images play a major role in contributing to spurious\\ncorrelations among different data points. Owing to aesthetic preferences of\\nhumans capturing the images, datasets can exhibit positional (location of the\\nobject within a given frame) and size (region-of-interest to image ratio)\\nbiases for different classes. In this paper, we show that these biases can\\nimpact how much a model relies on spurious features in the background to make\\nits predictions. To better illustrate our findings, we propose a synthetic\\ndataset derived from ImageNet1k, Hard-Spurious-ImageNet, which contains images\\nwith various backgrounds, object positions, and object sizes. By evaluating the\\ndataset on different pretrained models, we find that most models rely heavily\\non spurious features in the background when the region-of-interest (ROI) to\\nimage ratio is small and the object is far from the center of the image.\\nMoreover, we also show that current methods that aim to mitigate harmful\\nspurious features, do not take into account these factors, hence fail to\\nachieve considerable performance gains for worst-group accuracies when the size\\nand location of core features in an image change.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T14:27:01Z\"}"}
