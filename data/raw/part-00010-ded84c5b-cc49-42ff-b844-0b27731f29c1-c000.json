{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03444v1\", \"title\": \"The Frequency-dependent Modulation Features of PSR J1948+3540\", \"summary\": \"Using observations from GMRT and FAST, we conducted multi-wavelength studies\\non PSR J1948+3540 and analyzed its intensity modulation characteristics in\\ndetail. We found that the intensity modulation of this pulsar exhibits broad\\nlow-frequency modulation features. The modulation frequency/period is\\ntime-dependent, but the dominant modulation component varies with the observing\\nfrequency. Specifically, at low frequencies, the modulation is dominated by the\\nfirst half of the middle component, while at high frequencies, it is dominated\\nby the second half of the middle component. Spectral analysis revealed that the\\nintensities of the leading and trailing components vary with the observing\\nfrequency, but the middle component does not change significantly. Besides, the\\npolarization analyses reveal that the peak of the radiation intensity is\\nlocated in the latter half of the middle component, whereas the linear\\npolarization is dominant in the former half. However, due to the low degree of\\nlinear polarization, the change of the dominant modulation component with the\\nobserved frequency is not caused by the variation in linear polarization. The\\nphenomenon of the dominant modulation component varying with observing\\nfrequency has not been reported before and remains difficult to understand\\nwithin the current theoretical framework.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T11:30:21Z\"}"}
