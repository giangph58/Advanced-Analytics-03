We consider nonfractional\\nC^1 weights and, using an analogous formulation to the aforementioned works, we\\nalso introduce a (to our knowledge) new class of nonlocal weighted Sobolev\\nspaces. After establishing some fundamental properties and results regarding\\nthe structure of these spaces, we study their relationship with the classical\\nBV and Sobolev spaces, as well as with the space of test functions. We handle\\nboth the case of domains with finite measure and that of domains of infinite\\nmeasure, and show that these two situations lead to quite different scenarios.\\nAs an application, we also show that these function spaces are suitable for\\nestablishing existence and uniqueness results of global minimizers for several\\nclasses of functionals. Some of these functionals were introduced in the\\nabove-mentioned references for the study of image deblurring problems.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T13:26:24Z\"}"}
