Rev. X 9, 011034 (2019). An\\ninspiring conjecture was put forward lower bounding the energy fluctuations by\\nthe minimal geometric length of all accessible state preparation protocols. We\\nhere show that the conjecture holds if the accessible parameter space has no\\nextrinsic curvature, when embedded into the space of all dynamically accessible\\nstates. If the parameter space has extrinsic curvature a weakened version of\\nthe conjecture applies. We discuss instructive examples for a qubit system and\\nharmonic oscillators.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T15:32:29Z\"}"}
