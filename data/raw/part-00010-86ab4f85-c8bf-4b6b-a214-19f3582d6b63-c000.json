The metrics are conformally compact and generically neither\\nK\\\\\\\"ahler nor self-dual. The proof involves using rigorous numerics to produce\\nan approximate Einstein metric to high precision in a bounded region containing\\nthe singular orbit or \\\"bolt\\\", which is then perturbed to a genuine Einstein\\nmetric using fixed-point methods. At the boundary of this region, the latter\\nmetric is sufficiently close to hyperbolic space for us to show that it indeed\\nextends to a complete, asymptotically hyperbolic Einstein metric.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T13:47:27Z\"}"}
