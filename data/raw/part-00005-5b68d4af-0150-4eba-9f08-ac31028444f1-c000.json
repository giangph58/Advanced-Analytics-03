We consider the sets $ C_k(n) $ of tuples of $ n $\\npoints in the projective space $ \\\\mathbb{P}^{k-1}(K) $, such that $ k $\\nconsecutive points are always independent (the first and last point in the\\ntuple are considered to be consecutive). We prove that the problem of counting\\ntame $ SL_k $-frieze patterns can be reduced to counting these sets if $\\n\\\\gcd(k,n) = 1 $. Otherwise, certain subsets $ C_k^*(n) $ need to be considered\\ninstead. Afterwards we count $ C_k(n)$ in the cases $ k = 3 $ and $ k = 4 $ and\\n$ C_3^*(n) $, leading to our results.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T16:54:43Z\"}"}
