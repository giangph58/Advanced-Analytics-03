We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the\\nperiod-luminosity (PL) and period-luminosity-metallicity (PLZ) relation for\\n$\\\\delta$ Sct stars, integrating data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF),\\nthe Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), Large Sky Area Multi-Object\\nFiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), Apache Point Observatory Galactic\\nEvolution Experiment (APOGEE), and Gaia. To mitigate the impact of the Gaia\\nparallax zero point offset, we applied a correction method, determining the\\noptimal zero point value to be $zp_\\\\varpi = 35 \\\\pm 2 \\\\, \\\\mu\\\\text{as}$. Using\\nthe three best bands, by varying the parallax error threshold, we found that\\nthe total error of the PLR zero point was minimized to 0.9\\\\% at a parallax\\nerror threshold of 6\\\\%. With this threshold, we derived the PL and PLZ relation\\nfor nine bands (from optical to mid-infrared) and five Wesenheit bands. Through\\nour analysis, we conclude that the influence of metallicity on the PLR of\\n$\\\\delta$ Sct stars is not significant, and the differences across various bands\\nare minimal.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T11:57:12Z\"}"}
