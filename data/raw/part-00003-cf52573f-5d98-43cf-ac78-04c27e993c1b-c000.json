{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06742v1\", \"title\": \"nnLandmark: A Self-Configuring Method for 3D Medical Landmark Detection\", \"summary\": \"Landmark detection plays a crucial role in medical imaging tasks that rely on\\nprecise spatial localization, including specific applications in diagnosis,\\ntreatment planning, image registration, and surgical navigation. However,\\nmanual annotation is labor-intensive and requires expert knowledge. While deep\\nlearning shows promise in automating this task, progress is hindered by limited\\npublic datasets, inconsistent benchmarks, and non-standardized baselines,\\nrestricting reproducibility, fair comparisons, and model generalizability.This\\nwork introduces nnLandmark, a self-configuring deep learning framework for 3D\\nmedical landmark detection, adapting nnU-Net to perform heatmap-based\\nregression. By leveraging nnU-Net's automated configuration, nnLandmark\\neliminates the need for manual parameter tuning, offering out-of-the-box\\nusability. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across two public datasets,\\nwith a mean radial error (MRE) of 1.5 mm on the Mandibular Molar Landmark (MML)\\ndental CT dataset and 1.2 mm for anatomical fiducials on a brain MRI dataset\\n(AFIDs), where nnLandmark aligns with the inter-rater variability of 1.5 mm.\\nWith its strong generalization, reproducibility, and ease of deployment,\\nnnLandmark establishes a reliable baseline for 3D landmark detection,\\nsupporting research in anatomical localization and clinical workflows that\\ndepend on precise landmark identification. The code will be available soon.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T09:53:39Z\"}"}
