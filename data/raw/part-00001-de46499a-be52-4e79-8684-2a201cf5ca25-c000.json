{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16480v1\", \"title\": \"Balancing Costs and Utilities in Future Networks via Market Equilibrium\\n  with Externalities\", \"summary\": \"We study the problem of market equilibrium (ME) in future wireless networks,\\nwith multiple actors competing and negotiating for a pool of heterogeneous\\nresources (communication and computing) while meeting constraints in terms of\\nglobal cost. The latter is defined in a general way but is associated with\\nenergy and/or carbon emissions. In this direction, service providers competing\\nfor network resources do not acquire the latter, but rather the right to\\nconsume, given externally defined policies and regulations. We propose to apply\\nthe Fisher market model, and prove its convergence towards an equilibrium\\nbetween utilities, regulatory constraints, and individual budgets. The model is\\nthen applied to an exemplary use case of access network, edge computing, and\\ncloud resources, and numerical results assess the theoretical findings of\\nconvergence, under different assumptions on the utility function and more or\\nless stringent constraints.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GT\", \"categories\": \"cs.GT,cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T07:46:45Z\"}"}
