{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21772v1\", \"title\": \"Solving Copyright Infringement on Short Video Platforms: Novel Datasets\\n  and an Audio Restoration Deep Learning Pipeline\", \"summary\": \"Short video platforms like YouTube Shorts and TikTok face significant\\ncopyright compliance challenges, as infringers frequently embed arbitrary\\nbackground music (BGM) to obscure original soundtracks (OST) and evade content\\noriginality detection. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel pipeline that\\nintegrates Music Source Separation (MSS) and cross-modal video-music retrieval\\n(CMVMR). Our approach effectively separates arbitrary BGM from the original\\nOST, enabling the restoration of authentic video audio tracks. To support this\\nwork, we introduce two domain-specific datasets: OASD-20K for audio separation\\nand OSVAR-160 for pipeline evaluation. OASD-20K contains 20,000 audio clips\\nfeaturing mixed BGM and OST pairs, while OSVAR160 is a unique benchmark dataset\\ncomprising 1,121 video and mixed-audio pairs, specifically designed for short\\nvideo restoration tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our pipeline not\\nonly removes arbitrary BGM with high accuracy but also restores OSTs, ensuring\\ncontent integrity. This approach provides an ethical and scalable solution to\\ncopyright challenges in user-generated content on short video platforms.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MM\", \"categories\": \"cs.MM,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T16:17:05Z\"}"}
