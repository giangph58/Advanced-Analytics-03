We introduce several categories of\\n$\\\\mathcal{D}$-cap bimodules for which this theory is well-behaved. Among these,\\nthe most important example is the category of diagonal $\\\\mathcal{C}$-complexes.\\nWe give an explicit calculation of the Hochschild complex for diagonal\\n$\\\\mathcal{C}$-complexes, and show that the Hochschild complex of\\n$\\\\mathcal{D}$-cap is canonically isomorphic to the de Rham complex of $X$. In\\nparticular, we obtain a Hodge-de Rham spectral sequence converging to the\\nHochschild cohomology groups of $\\\\mathcal{D}$-cap. We obtain explicit formulas\\nrelating the Hochschild cohomology and homology of a given diagonal\\n$\\\\mathcal{C}$-complex.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT,math.AG,math.RA,math.RT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T13:38:57Z\"}"}
