This paper proposes a novel framework to enhance\\nspecification test performance using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for\\ndirection learning. We introduce two alternative SVM-based approaches: one\\nmaximizes the discrepancy between nonparametric and parametric classes, while\\nthe other maximizes the separation between residuals and the origin. Both\\napproaches lead to a $t$-type test statistic that converges to a standard\\nchi-square distribution under the null hypothesis. Our method is\\ncomputationally efficient and capable of detecting any arbitrary alternative.\\nSimulation studies demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing\\nmethods, particularly in large-dimensional settings.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.EM\", \"categories\": \"econ.EM\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T13:51:00Z\"}"}
