We also\\nanalyze the role of permutivity as a key factor influencing these properties\\nand provide conditions that determine whether a non-linear CA is (bi)permutive.\\nThrough theoretical results and illustrative examples, we characterize the\\nrelationships between these fundamental properties, offering new insights into\\nthe dynamical behavior of non-linear CA.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DM\", \"categories\": \"cs.DM,cs.CR,math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T14:47:16Z\"}"}
