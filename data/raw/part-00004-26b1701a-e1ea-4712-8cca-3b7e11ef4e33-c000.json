We present a framework based on\\ngraphs and digraphs which offers a new unified way to view these structures,\\nand leads to natural new research questions. We present constructions and\\nstructural results about these digraph-defined EDFs, and we obtain new explicit\\nconstructions for infinite families of CEDFs, in particular\\n$(ml^2,m,l,1)$-CEDFs. We construct the first infinite family of such CEDFs in\\nnon-cyclic abelian groups; these have odd values of $m$ and $l$. We also\\npresent the first CEDF in a non-abelian group.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:32:07Z\"}"}
