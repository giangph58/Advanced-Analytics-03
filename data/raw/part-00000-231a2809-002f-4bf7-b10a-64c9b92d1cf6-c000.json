It is formulated for\\nan affine-null metric and the resulting field equations are cast into a\\nhierarchical system of partial differential equations. The initial boundary\\nvalue problem for a family of null hypersurfaces is specified for a\\ntimelike-null foliation at the central geodesic of spherical symmetry as well\\nas for a double-null foliation where the corresponding boundary is a null\\nhypersurface. For the latter, two distinct boundary value formulations arise --\\none where the null boundary has zero Misner-Sharp mass and another one where\\nthe corresponding Misner-Sharp mass is nonzero. As an application, the\\nnonextremal and the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\\\\\\\"om solution in null coordinates\\nfor a charged black hole and the Fisher-Janis-Newman-Winicour solution are\\nderived.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:46:11Z\"}"}
