This leads to a variety of applications, including a structural\\ntheorem for minimal cbba's, a construction of relative minimal models with\\ntwisted coefficients, as well as a proof of uniqueness. These results are\\nfurther employed to study automorphism groups of minimal cbba's and to\\ncharacterize formality in terms of grading automorphisms.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AT\", \"categories\": \"math.AT,math.AC,math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T05:35:50Z\"}"}
