We denote this ideal by $P_2(X)$ where $X$ is a symmetric\\nmatrix. We compute a Gr\\\\\\\"obner basis, dimension, depth, minimal primes, and a\\nprimary decomposition of $P_2(X)$. It can be seen that the answer is reliant on\\nwhether the characteristic of the base field is two, and thus these ideals\\nconstitute a class of ideals whose algebraic properties depend on\\ncharacteristics of the base field.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AC\", \"categories\": \"math.AC,math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T09:39:45Z\"}"}
