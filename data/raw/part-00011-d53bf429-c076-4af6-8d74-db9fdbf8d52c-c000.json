{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11110v1\", \"title\": \"Helper-Friendly Latency-Bounded Mitigation Strategies against Reactive\\n  Jamming Adversaries\", \"summary\": \"Due to the recent developments in the field of full-duplex radios and\\ncognitive radios, a new class of reactive jamming attacks has gained attention\\nwherein an adversary transmits jamming energy over the victim's frequency band\\nand also monitors various energy statistics in the network so as to detect\\ncountermeasures, thereby trapping the victim. Although cooperative mitigation\\nstrategies against such security threats exist, they are known to incur\\nspectral-efficiency loss on the helper node, and are also not robust to\\nvariable latency-constraints on victim's messages. Identifying these research\\ngaps in existing countermeasures against reactive jamming attacks, we propose a\\nfamily of helper-friendly cooperative mitigation strategies that are applicable\\nfor a wide-range of latency-requirements on the victim's messages as well as\\npractical radio hardware at the helper nodes. The proposed strategies are\\ndesigned to facilitate reliable communication for the victim, without\\ncompromising the helper's spectral efficiency and also minimally disturbing the\\nvarious energy statistics in the network. For theoretical guarantees on their\\nefficacy, interesting optimization problems are formulated on the choice of the\\nunderlying parameters, followed by extensive mathematical analyses on their\\nerror-performance and covertness. Experimental results indicate that the\\nproposed strategies should be preferred over the state-of-the-art methods when\\nthe helper node is unwilling to compromise on its error performance for\\nassisting the victim.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T11:56:57Z\"}"}
