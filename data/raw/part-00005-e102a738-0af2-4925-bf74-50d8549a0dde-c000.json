This paper presents Cognitive Silicon:\\na hypothetical full-stack architectural framework projected toward 2035,\\nexploring a possible trajectory for cognitive computing system design. The\\nproposed architecture would integrate symbolic scaffolding, governed memory,\\nruntime moral coherence, and alignment-aware execution across\\nsilicon-to-semantics layers. Our design grammar has emerged from dialectical\\nco-design with LLMs under asymmetric epistemic conditions--creating structured\\nfriction to expose blind spots and trade-offs. The envisioned framework would\\nestablish mortality as a natural consequence of physical constraints,\\nnon-copyable tacit knowledge, and non-cloneable identity keys as\\ncognitive-embodiment primitives. Core tensions (trust/agency,\\nscaffolding/emergence, execution/governance) would function as central\\narchitectural pressures rather than edge cases. The architecture theoretically\\nconverges with the Free Energy Principle, potentially offering a formal account\\nof how cognitive systems could maintain identity through prediction error\\nminimization across physical and computational boundaries. The resulting\\nframework aims to deliver a morally tractable cognitive infrastructure that\\ncould maintain human-alignment through irreversible hardware constraints and\\nidentity-bound epistemic mechanisms resistant to replication or subversion.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T11:24:30Z\"}"}
