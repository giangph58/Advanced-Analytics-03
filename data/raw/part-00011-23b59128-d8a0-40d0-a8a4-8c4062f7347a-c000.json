According to the authors of the study this provides\\na strong challenge the standard cold dark matter model, since the dark haloes\\nare too small to explain their observations, especially for small stellar\\nmasses. In this article, we show that improving their model, the virial radius\\nis larger than their estimates. The NFW rotational curve, and especially the\\npseudo Isothermal one, are in agreement with their flat rotational curves,\\nespecially for the larger baryonic mass bins used by the authors.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T05:47:06Z\"}"}
