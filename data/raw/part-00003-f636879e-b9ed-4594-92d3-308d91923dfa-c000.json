{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20747v1\", \"title\": \"Performance Evaluation of Efficient Hybrid Compression Methods For\\n  Devanagiri-Encoded Hindi Text Using Lossless Algorithms\", \"summary\": \"This research paper provides a comprehensive performance analysis of five\\nstandard lossless compression algorithms-LZMA, Zstd, Brotli, Bzip2, and\\nLZ4HC-alongside sixty hybrid combinations on UTF-8 encoded Hindi text datasets,\\nwritten in the Devanagari script, across varying sizes-small, medium, and\\nlarge. The evaluation covers compression ratio, compression speed,\\ndecompression speed, and a derived weighted normalized efficiency score. Hybrid\\nalgorithms-especially those combining Zstd with LZ4HC or Brotli-demonstrate\\nsuperior performance across all individual parameters. Independent Zstd\\nachieves the highest efficiency score for the medium-sized dataset,\\nillustrating how a well-balanced algorithm can excel in overall efficiency\\ndespite not leading in any single metric. However, in terms of compression\\nratio, speed, and decompression speed, hybrid methods consistently outperform\\nstandalone approaches. Notably, the hybrid combination Zstd + LZ4HC achieves\\nthe highest efficiency, with scores of 0.6764 for small files and 0.8597 for\\nlarge files. Independent algorithms such as Zstd and Bzip2 perform well but are\\nconsistently surpassed by strategic hybrid pairings. The analysis underscores\\nthe significance of combining fast and high-ratio compression techniques,\\nparticularly for language-specific data. However, not all hybrids yielded\\nsignificant improvements, with some introducing computational overhead. This\\ncomparative analysis highlights the potential of hybrid compression in\\napplications such as cloud storage, mobile messaging, and NLP-based Hindi text\\nprocessing.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:27:32Z\"}"}
