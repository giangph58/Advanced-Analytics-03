{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01551v1\", \"title\": \"Identifying Macro Causal Effects in C-DMGs\", \"summary\": \"Causal effect identification using causal graphs is a fundamental challenge\\nin causal inference. While extensive research has been conducted in this area,\\nmost existing methods assume the availability of fully specified causal graphs.\\nHowever, in complex domains such as medicine and epidemiology, complete causal\\nknowledge is often unavailable, and only partial information about the system\\nis accessible. This paper focuses on causal effect identification within\\npartially specified causal graphs, with particular emphasis on cluster-directed\\nmixed graphs (C-DMGs). These graphs provide a higher-level representation of\\ncausal relationships by grouping variables into clusters, offering a more\\npractical approach for handling complex systems. Unlike fully specified causal\\ngraphs, C-DMGs can contain cycles, which complicate their analysis and\\ninterpretation. Furthermore, their cluster-based nature introduces new\\nchallenges, as it gives rise to two distinct types of causal effects, macro\\ncausal effects and micro causal effects, with different properties. In this\\nwork, we focus on macro causal effects, which describe the effects of entire\\nclusters on other clusters. We establish that the do-calculus is both sound and\\ncomplete for identifying these effects in C-DMGs. Additionally, we provide a\\ngraphical characterization of non-identifiability for macro causal effects in\\nthese graphs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T09:48:27Z\"}"}
