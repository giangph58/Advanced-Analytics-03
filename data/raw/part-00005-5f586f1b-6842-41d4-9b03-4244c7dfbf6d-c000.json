Spatial modulation of interlayer distance, caused by the\\ndislocations, generates effective potentials that promote emergence of\\none-dimensional quasi-bound bands of layer breathing modes inside perfect\\ndislocations forming in the bilayers with parallel and antiparallel alignment\\nof layers. We show that for parallel MX$_2$ bilayers perfect dislocations host\\nseveral quasi-bound bands, with frequencies above layer breathing mode in\\nrhombohedral-stacked domains, whereas for antiparallel bilayers only a single\\nquasi-bound band arises near the edge dislocation type, having frequencies\\nabove the layer breathing mode in 2H-stacked domains.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:06:35Z\"}"}
