{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02824v1\", \"title\": \"Observation of non-Hermitian dislocation bound states and dislocation\\n  skin effects\", \"summary\": \"The confluence of Non-Hermitian (NH) topology and crystal defects has\\nculminated significant interest, yet its experimental exploration has been\\nlimited due to the challenges involved in design and measurements. Here, we\\nshowcase experimental observation of NH dislocation bound states (NHDS) and the\\ndislocation-induced NH skin effect in two-dimensional acoustic NH Chern\\nlattices. By embedding edge dislocations in such acoustic lattices and\\nimplementing precision-controlled hopping and onsite gain/loss via active\\nmeta-atoms, we reveal robust defect-bound states localized at dislocation cores\\nwithin the line gap of the complex energy spectrum. These NHDS survive against\\nmoderate NH perturbations but gradually delocalize and merge with the bulk\\n(skin) states as the system arrives at the shore of fostering exceptional\\npoints in the Brillouin zone under periodic (open) boundary conditions.\\nFurthermore, our experiments demonstrate that the dislocation core can feature\\nweak NH skin effects when its direction is perpendicular to the Burgers vector\\nin periodic systems. Our findings pave an experimental pathway for probing NH\\ntopology via lattice defects and open new avenues for defect-engineered\\ntopological devices.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,physics.class-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T17:59:25Z\"}"}
