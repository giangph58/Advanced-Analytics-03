{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04431v1\", \"title\": \"An Asynchronous Distributed-Memory Parallel Algorithm for k-mer Counting\", \"summary\": \"This paper describes a new asynchronous algorithm and implementation for the\\nproblem of k-mer counting (KC), which concerns quantifying the frequency of\\nlength k substrings in a DNA sequence. This operation is common to many\\ncomputational biology workloads and can take up to 77% of the total runtime of\\nde novo genome assembly. The performance and scalability of the current\\nstate-of-the-art distributed-memory KC algorithm are hampered by multiple\\nrounds of Many-To-Many collectives. Therefore, we develop an asynchronous\\nalgorithm (DAKC) that uses fine-grained, asynchronous messages to obviate most\\nof this global communication while utilizing network bandwidth efficiently via\\ncustom message aggregation protocols. DAKC can perform strong scaling up to 256\\nnodes (512 sockets / 6K cores) and can count k-mers up to 9x faster than the\\nstate-of-the-art distributed-memory algorithm, and up to 100x faster than the\\nshared-memory alternative. We also provide an analytical model to understand\\nthe hardware resource utilization of our asynchronous KC algorithm and provide\\ninsights on the performance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC,q-bio.GN\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:00:03Z\"}"}
