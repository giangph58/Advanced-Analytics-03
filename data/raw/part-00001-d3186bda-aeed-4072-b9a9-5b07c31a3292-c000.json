We demonstrate that\\nincreasing concentrations of zwitterionic osmolytes result in a marked\\nsynergistic enhancement of both disjoining pressure and differential\\ncapacitance, highlighting their dual role in improving supercapacitor\\nperformance. The insights gained underscore the unique capabilities of\\nzwitterionic osmolytes as multifunctional additives for fine-tuning the\\nproperties of electric double layers, thereby bridging the gap between\\ncapacitive efficiency and electrode longevity.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T13:40:05Z\"}"}
