{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20746v1\", \"title\": \"Trotterization is substantially efficient for low-energy states\", \"summary\": \"Trotterization is one of the central approaches for simulating quantum\\nmany-body dynamics on quantum computers or tensor networks. In addition to its\\nsimple implementation, recent studies have revealed that its error and cost can\\nbe reduced if the initial state is closed in the low-energy subspace. However,\\nthe improvement by the low-energy property rapidly vanishes as the Trotter\\norder grows in the previous studies, and thus, it is mysterious whether there\\nexists genuine advantage of low-energy initial states. In this Letter, we\\nresolve this problem by proving the optimal error bound and cost of\\nTrotterization for low-energy initial states. For generic local Hamiltonians\\ncomposed of positive-semidefinite terms, we show that the Trotter error is at\\nmost linear in the initial state energy $\\\\Delta$ and polylogarithmic in the\\nsystem size $N$. As a result, the computational cost becomes substantially\\nsmall for low-energy states with $\\\\Delta \\\\in o(Ng)$ compared to the one for\\narbitrary initial states, where $g$ denotes the energy per site and $Ng$ means\\nthe whole-system energy. Our error bound and cost of Trotterization achieve the\\ntheoretically-best scaling in the initial state energy $\\\\Delta$. In addition,\\nthey can be partially extended to weakly-correlated initial states having\\nlow-energy expectation values, which are not necessarily closed in the\\nlow-energy subspace. Our results will pave the way for fast and accurate\\nsimulation of low-energy states, which are one central targets in condensed\\nmatter physics and quantum chemistry.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.other,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:27:14Z\"}"}
