Creating a large training dataset encompassing\\nall relevant load scenarios is essential for a good surrogate, yet the\\ncomputational cost of producing this data quickly becomes a limiting factor.\\nCommonly, a pre-trained surrogate is used throughout the computational domain.\\nHere, we introduce an alternative adaptive mixture approach that uses a fast\\nprobabilistic surrogate model as constitutive model when possible, but resorts\\nback to the true high-fidelity model when necessary. The surrogate is thus not\\nrequired to be accurate for every possible load condition, enabling a\\nsignificant reduction in the data collection time. We achieve this by creating\\nphases in the computational domain corresponding to the different models. These\\nphases evolve using a phase-field model driven by the surrogate uncertainty.\\nWhen the surrogate uncertainty becomes large, the phase-field model causes a\\nlocal transition from the surrogate to the high-fidelity model, maintaining a\\nhighly accurate simulation. We discuss the requirements of this approach to\\nachieve accurate and numerically stable results and compare the phase-field\\nmodel to a purely local approach that does not enforce spatial smoothness for\\nthe phase mixing. Using a Gaussian Process surrogate for an elasto-plastic\\nmaterial, we demonstrate the potential of this mixture of models to accelerate\\nmultiscale simulations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.CE,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T13:42:07Z\"}"}
