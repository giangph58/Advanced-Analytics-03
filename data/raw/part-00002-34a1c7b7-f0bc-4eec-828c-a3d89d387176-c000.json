We classify these hallucinations within verb and noun\\ncategories, identifying six distinct patterns among the latter. Additionally,\\nwe analyse whether these hallucinations adhere to Irish morphological rules and\\nwhat linguistic tendencies they exhibit. Our findings show that while both\\nGPT-4.o and GPT-4.o Mini produce similar types of hallucinations, the Mini\\nmodel generates them at a significantly higher frequency. Beyond\\nclassification, the discussion raises speculative questions about the\\nimplications of these hallucinations for the Irish language. Rather than\\nseeking definitive answers, we offer food for thought regarding the increasing\\nuse of LLMs and their potential role in shaping Irish vocabulary and linguistic\\nevolution. We aim to prompt discussion on how such technologies might influence\\nlanguage over time, particularly in the context of low-resource,\\nmorphologically rich languages.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T12:08:47Z\"}"}
