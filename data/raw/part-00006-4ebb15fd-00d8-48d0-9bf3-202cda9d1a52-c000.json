{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07627v1\", \"title\": \"Robustness of Online Identification-based Policy Iteration to Noisy Data\", \"summary\": \"This article investigates the core mechanisms of indirect data-driven control\\nfor unknown systems, focusing on the application of policy iteration (PI)\\nwithin the context of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) optimal control\\nproblem. Specifically, we consider a setting where data is collected\\nsequentially from a linear system subject to exogenous process noise, and is\\nthen used to refine estimates of the optimal control policy. We integrate\\nrecursive least squares (RLS) for online model estimation within a\\ncertainty-equivalent framework, and employ PI to iteratively update the control\\npolicy. In this work, we investigate first the convergence behavior of RLS\\nunder two different models of adversarial noise, namely point-wise and energy\\nbounded noise, and then we provide a closed-loop analysis of the combined model\\nidentification and control design process. This iterative scheme is formulated\\nas an algorithmic dynamical system consisting of the feedback interconnection\\nbetween two algorithms expressed as discrete-time systems. This system\\ntheoretic viewpoint on indirect data-driven control allows us to establish\\nconvergence guarantees to the optimal controller in the face of uncertainty\\ncaused by noisy data. Simulations illustrate the theoretical results.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T10:24:13Z\"}"}
