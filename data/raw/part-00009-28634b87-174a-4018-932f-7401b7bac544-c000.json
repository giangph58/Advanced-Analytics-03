{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20579v1\", \"title\": \"Representation Learning Preserving Ignorability and Covariate Matching\\n  for Treatment Effects\", \"summary\": \"Estimating treatment effects from observational data is challenging due to\\ntwo main reasons: (a) hidden confounding, and (b) covariate mismatch (control\\nand treatment groups not having identical distributions). Long lines of works\\nexist that address only either of these issues. To address the former,\\nconventional techniques that require detailed knowledge in the form of causal\\ngraphs have been proposed. For the latter, covariate matching and importance\\nweighting methods have been used. Recently, there has been progress in\\ncombining testable independencies with partial side information for tackling\\nhidden confounding. A common framework to address both hidden confounding and\\nselection bias is missing. We propose neural architectures that aim to learn a\\nrepresentation of pre-treatment covariates that is a valid adjustment and also\\nsatisfies covariate matching constraints. We combine two different neural\\narchitectures: one based on gradient matching across domains created by\\nsubsampling a suitable anchor variable that assumes causal side information,\\nfollowed by the other, a covariate matching transformation. We prove that\\napproximately invariant representations yield approximate valid adjustment sets\\nwhich would enable an interval around the true causal effect. In contrast to\\nusual sensitivity analysis, where an unknown nuisance parameter is varied, we\\nhave a testable approximation yielding a bound on the effect estimate. We also\\noutperform various baselines with respect to ATE and PEHE errors on causal\\nbenchmarks that include IHDP, Jobs, Cattaneo, and an image-based Crowd\\nManagement dataset.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T09:33:56Z\"}"}
