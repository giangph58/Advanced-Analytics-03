We focus first on\\nthe homogeneous case where the ambient (incompressible and viscous) fluid\\ncarrying the particles has a constant density, and then on the variable-density\\ncase. In both cases, large-time convergence to a monokinetic final state is\\ndemonstrated. For any finite energy initial data, we exhibit an algebraic\\nconvergence rate that deteriorates as the initial particle distribution\\nincreases. When the initial particle distribution is suitably small, then the\\nconvergence rate becomes exponential, a result consistent with the work of\\nHan-Kwan et al. [17] dedicated to the homogeneous, three-dimensional case,\\nwhere an additional smallness condition on the velocity was required. In the\\nnon-homogeneous case, we establish similar stability results, allowing a\\npiecewise constant fluid density with jumps.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:27:44Z\"}"}
