{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17790v1\", \"title\": \"Quantum Error Correction with Girth-16 Non-Binary LDPC Codes via Affine\\n  Permutation Construction\", \"summary\": \"We propose a method for constructing quantum error-correcting codes based on\\nnon-binary low-density parity-check codes with girth 16. In conventional\\nconstructions using circulant permutation matrices, the girth is upper-bounded\\nby 12, which limits the suppression of harmful short cycles. Our construction\\nemploys affine permutation matrices and a randomized sequential selection\\nprocedure designed to eliminate short cycles, which are known to limit decoding\\nperformance.\\n  Joint belief propagation decoding is applied over depolarizing channels.\\nNumerical experiments confirm that the proposed codes reduce the number of\\nlow-weight codewords in $C_X \\\\setminus C_Z^\\\\perp$ and $C_Z \\\\setminus\\nC_X^\\\\perp$, and thus have the potential to suppress error floors. In addition,\\nwe obtain a significantly improved upper bound on the minimum distance, which\\nwe conjecture to be tight.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T17:59:58Z\"}"}
