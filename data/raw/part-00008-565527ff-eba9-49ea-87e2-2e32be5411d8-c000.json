{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20689v1\", \"title\": \"DICOM Compatible, 3D Multimodality Image Encryption using Hyperchaotic\\n  Signal\", \"summary\": \"Medical image encryption plays an important role in protecting sensitive\\nhealth information from cyberattacks and unauthorized access. In this paper, we\\nintroduce a secure and robust encryption scheme that is multi-modality\\ncompatible and works with MRI, CT, X-Ray and Ultrasound images for different\\nanatomical region of interest. The method utilizes hyperchaotic signals and\\nmulti-level diffusion methods. The encryption starts by taking DICOM image as\\ninput, then padding to increase the image area. Chaotic signals are produced by\\na logistic map and are used to carry out pixel random permutation. Then,\\nmulti-level diffusion is carried out by 4-bit, 8-bit, radial and adjacent\\ndiffusion to provide high randomness and immunity against statistical attacks.\\nIn addition, we propose a captcha-based authentication scheme to further\\nimprove security. An algorithm generates alphanumeric captcha-based image which\\nis encrypted with the same chaotic and diffusion methods as the medical image.\\nBoth encrypted images(DICOM image and captcha image) are then superimposed to\\ncreate a final encrypted output, essentially integrating dual-layer security.\\nUpon decryption, the superimposed image is again decomposed back to original\\nmedical and captcha images, and inverse operations are performed to obtain the\\noriginal unencrypted data. Experimental results show that the proposed method\\nprovides strong protection with no loss in image integrity, thereby reducing\\nunauthorized data breaches to a significant level. The dual-encryption approach\\nnot only protects the confidentiality of the medical images but also enhances\\nauthentication by incorporating captcha.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,nlin.CD\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T12:11:23Z\"}"}
