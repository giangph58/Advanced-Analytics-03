{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15222v1\", \"title\": \"Did DESI DR2 truly reveal dynamical dark energy?\", \"summary\": \"A fundamental question in cosmology is whether dark energy evolves over time,\\na topic that has gained prominence since the discovery of cosmic acceleration.\\nRecently, the DESI collaboration has reported increasing evidence for evolving\\ndark energy using combinations of cosmic microwave background (CMB), type Ia\\nsupernova (SN), and their new measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations\\n(BAO). However, our analysis reveals that these combinations are problematic\\ndue to clear tensions among the CMB, BAO and SN datasets. Consequently, DESI's\\nclaim of dynamical dark energy (DDE) is not robust. A more reliable approach\\ninvolves constraining the evolution of dark energy using each dataset\\nindependently. Through a statistical comparison for each dataset, on average,\\nwe find that DDE is strongly preferred over the $\\\\Lambda$CDM model. This\\nsuggests that DDE likely exists, although its real parameter space remains\\nelusive due to weak constraints on the dark energy equation of state and\\ninconsistencies among the datasets. Interestingly, when considering DDE, none\\nof the individual datasets -- including CMB, DESI DR2, Pantheon+, Union3, and\\nDESY5 -- can independently detect cosmic acceleration at a significant level.\\nOur findings not only clarify the current understanding of the nature of dark\\nenergy but also challenge the established discovery of cosmic acceleration and\\nthe long-held notion that dark energy exerts negative pressure. Both individual\\nand combined datasets suggest that the ultimate fate of the universe is likely\\nto be dominated by matter rather than dark energy.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.HE,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T16:50:54Z\"}"}
