Tactile sensors in theory can equip the robots with\\nsuch capabilities. However, accuracy of the measured forces is not on a par\\nwith those of the force sensors due to the potential calibration challenges and\\nnoise. This has limited the values these sensors can offer in manipulation\\napplications that require force control. In this paper, we introduce GeoDEx, a\\nunified estimation, planning, and control framework using geometric primitives\\nsuch as plane, cone and ellipsoid, which enables dexterous as well as extrinsic\\nmanipulation in the presence of uncertain force readings. Through various\\nexperimental results, we show that while relying on direct inaccurate and noisy\\nforce readings from tactile sensors results in unstable or failed manipulation,\\nour method enables successful grasping and extrinsic manipulation of different\\nobjects. Additionally, compared to directly running optimization using SOCP\\n(Second Order Cone Programming), planning and force estimation using our\\nframework achieves a 14x speed-up.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T16:40:47Z\"}"}
