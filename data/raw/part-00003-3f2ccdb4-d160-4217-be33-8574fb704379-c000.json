We develop a comprehensive theoretical framework for defining\\nand calculating fractional powers of positive operators and extend these\\nresults to block operator matrices. Various methods, including alternative\\nformulas, change of variables, and the second resolvent identity, are employed\\nto obtain explicit expressions for fractional powers. The results are applied\\nto systems of PDEs, demonstrating the relevance and effectiveness of the\\nproposed approaches in modeling and analyzing complex dynamical systems.\\nExamples are provided to illustrate the theoretical findings and their\\napplicability to concrete problems\", \"main_category\": \"math.SP\", \"categories\": \"math.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T09:56:47Z\"}"}
