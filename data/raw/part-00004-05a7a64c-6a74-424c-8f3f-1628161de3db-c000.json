The\\nfamily considered is the unique family of weight-homogeneous polynomial\\ndifferential systems of weight-degree 2 with a center. When the switching line\\nis $x=0$ or $y=0$, we obtain the sharp bounds of the number of limit cycles for\\nthe perturbed systems by using the first order averaging method. Our results\\nindicate that non-smooth systems can have more limit cycles than smooth ones,\\nand the switching lines play an important role in the dynamics of non-smooth\\nsystems.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:13:29Z\"}"}
