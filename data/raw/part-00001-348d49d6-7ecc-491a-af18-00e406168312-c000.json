{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21660v1\", \"title\": \"Universal Structures and Emergent Geometry from Large-$c$ BCFT Ensemble\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we study the ensemble average of boundary CFT (BCFT) data\\nconsistent with the bootstrap equations. We apply the results to computing\\nensemble average of copies of multi-point correlation functions of boundary\\nchanging operators (BCO), and find the results in agreement with one copy of\\nthe Virasoro TQFT. Further, we consider ensemble average of CFT path-integrals\\nexpressed as tensor networks of BCO correlation functions using the formalism\\ndeveloped in arXiv:2210.12127, arXiv:2311.18005 and arXiv:2403.03179. We find a\\nnatural emergence of locality and a loop-sum structure reminiscent of lattice\\nintegrable models. We illustrate this universal structure through explicit\\nexamples at genus zero and genus one. Moreover, we provide strong evidence\\nthat, at leading order in large-$c$, the results match those of\\nthree-dimensional Einstein gravity. In the presence of closed CFT operator\\ninsertions, generalized free fields emerge, with their correlation functions\\ngoverned by the shortest paths connecting the insertions.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:02:05Z\"}"}
