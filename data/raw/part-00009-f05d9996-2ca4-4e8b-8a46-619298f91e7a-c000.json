{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04986v1\", \"title\": \"Conformal Prediction with Cellwise Outliers: A Detect-then-Impute\\n  Approach\", \"summary\": \"Conformal prediction is a powerful tool for constructing prediction intervals\\nfor black-box models, providing a finite sample coverage guarantee for\\nexchangeable data. However, this exchangeability is compromised when some\\nentries of the test feature are contaminated, such as in the case of cellwise\\noutliers. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel framework called\\ndetect-then-impute conformal prediction. This framework first employs an\\noutlier detection procedure on the test feature and then utilizes an imputation\\nmethod to fill in those cells identified as outliers. To quantify the\\nuncertainty in the processed test feature, we adaptively apply the detection\\nand imputation procedures to the calibration set, thereby constructing\\nexchangeable features for the conformal prediction interval of the test label.\\nWe develop two practical algorithms, PDI-CP and JDI-CP, and provide a\\ndistribution-free coverage analysis under some commonly used detection and\\nimputation procedures. Notably, JDI-CP achieves a finite sample $1-2\\\\alpha$\\ncoverage guarantee. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real datasets\\ndemonstrate that our proposed algorithms exhibit robust coverage properties and\\ncomparable efficiency to the oracle baseline.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ML\", \"categories\": \"stat.ML,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T06:43:18Z\"}"}
