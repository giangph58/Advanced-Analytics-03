{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02698v1\", \"title\": \"SCMPPI: Supervised Contrastive Multimodal Framework for Predicting\\n  Protein-Protein Interactions\", \"summary\": \"Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) prediction is a key task in uncovering\\ncellular functional networks and disease mechanisms. However, traditional\\nexperimental methods are time-consuming and costly, and existing computational\\nmodels face challenges in cross-modal feature fusion, robustness, and\\nfalse-negative suppression. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised\\ncontrastive multimodal framework, SCMPPI, for PPI prediction. By integrating\\nprotein sequence features (AAC, DPC, CKSAAP-ESMC) with PPI network topology\\ninformation (Node2Vec graph embedding), and combining an improved supervised\\ncontrastive learning strategy, SCMPPI significantly enhances PPI prediction\\nperformance. For the PPI task, SCMPPI introduces a negative sample filtering\\nmechanism and modifies the contrastive loss function, effectively optimizing\\nmultimodal features. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets, including yeast,\\nhuman, and H.pylori, show that SCMPPI outperforms existing state-of-the-art\\nmethods (such as DF-PPI and TAGPPI) in key metrics such as accuracy ( 98.01%)\\nand AUC (99.62%), and demonstrates strong generalization in cross-species\\nprediction (AUC > 99% on multi-species datasets). Furthermore, SCMPPI has been\\nsuccessfully applied to CD9 networks, the Wnt pathway, and cancer-specific\\nnetworks, providing a reliable tool for disease target discovery. This\\nframework also offers a new paradigm for multimodal biological information\\nfusion and contrastive learning in collaborative optimization for various\\ncombined predictions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,q-bio.QM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:34:02Z\"}"}
