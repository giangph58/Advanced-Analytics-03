{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21433v1\", \"title\": \"NGENT: Next-Generation AI Agents Must Integrate Multi-Domain Abilities\\n  to Achieve Artificial General Intelligence\", \"summary\": \"This paper argues that the next generation of AI agent (NGENT) should\\nintegrate across-domain abilities to advance toward Artificial General\\nIntelligence (AGI). Although current AI agents are effective in specialized\\ntasks such as robotics, role-playing, and tool-using, they remain confined to\\nnarrow domains. We propose that future AI agents should synthesize the\\nstrengths of these specialized systems into a unified framework capable of\\noperating across text, vision, robotics, reinforcement learning, emotional\\nintelligence, and beyond. This integration is not only feasible but also\\nessential for achieving the versatility and adaptability that characterize\\nhuman intelligence. The convergence of technologies across AI domains, coupled\\nwith increasing user demand for cross-domain capabilities, suggests that such\\nintegration is within reach. Ultimately, the development of these versatile\\nagents is a critical step toward realizing AGI. This paper explores the\\nrationale for this shift, potential pathways for achieving it.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T08:46:14Z\"}"}
