We focus here on\\nsome issues related to the matrix Titchmarsh-Weyl function, but we also\\nconsider generalizations of some other tools used by subordinacy theory,\\nincluding the matrix orthogonal polynomials, the notion of finite cyclicity, a\\nvariant of a notion of nonsubordinacy, as well as Jitomirskaya-Last type\\nsemi-norms. The article brings together some issues already known, our new\\nconcepts, and also improvements and strengthening of some results already\\nexisting. We give simpler proofs of some known facts or we add details usually\\nomitted in the existing literature. The introduction contains a separate part\\ndevoted to a brief review of the main spectral analysis methods used so far for\\nblock Jacobi operators.\", \"main_category\": \"math.SP\", \"categories\": \"math.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T07:44:09Z\"}"}
