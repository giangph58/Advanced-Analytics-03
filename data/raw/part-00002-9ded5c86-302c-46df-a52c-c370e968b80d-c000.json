In this\\ndiscussion paper, we employ a helpful approach of Feasible Generalized Least\\nSquares (FGLS) to assess if there are statistically relevant relationships\\nbetween hemoglobin (adjusted to sea-level), weight, and height from 2007 to\\n2022 in children up to five years of age in Peru. By using this method, we may\\nfind a tool that allows us to confirm if the relationships considered between\\nthe target variables by the Peruvian agencies and authorities are in the right\\ndirection to fight against chronic malnutrition and stunting.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.PE\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.PE,econ.EM,stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T12:27:06Z\"}"}
