We present a systematic framework for\\nunderstanding how human-centered AI (HCAI) can transform the visualization\\ndiscipline. Our framework maps four key HCAI tool capabilities -- amplify,\\naugment, empower, and enhance -- onto the four phases of visual sensemaking:\\nview, explore, schematize, and report. For each combination, we review existing\\ntools, envision future possibilities, identify challenges and pitfalls, and\\nexamine ethical considerations. This design space can serve as an R\\\\&D agenda\\nfor both visualization researchers and practitioners to integrate AI into their\\nwork as well as understanding how visualization can support HCAI research.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,H.5.2\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T07:52:18Z\"}"}
