{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05015v1\", \"title\": \"An Agent-Based Modeling Approach to Free-Text Keyboard Dynamics for\\n  Continuous Authentication\", \"summary\": \"Continuous authentication systems leveraging free-text keyboard dynamics\\noffer a promising additional layer of security in a multifactor authentication\\nsetup that can be used in a transparent way with no impact on user experience.\\nThis study investigates the efficacy of behavioral biometrics by employing an\\nAgent-Based Model (ABM) to simulate diverse typing profiles across mechanical\\nand membrane keyboards. Specifically, we generated synthetic keystroke data\\nfrom five unique agents, capturing features related to dwell time, flight time,\\nand error rates within sliding 5-second windows updated every second. Two\\nmachine learning approaches, One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) and\\nRandom Forest (RF), were evaluated for user verification. Results revealed a\\nstark contrast in performance: while One-Class SVM failed to differentiate\\nindividual users within each group, Random Forest achieved robust\\nintra-keyboard user recognition (Accuracy > 0.7) but struggled to generalize\\nacross keyboards for the same user, highlighting the significant impact of\\nkeyboard hardware on typing behavior. These findings suggest that: (1)\\nkeyboard-specific user profiles may be necessary for reliable authentication,\\nand (2) ensemble methods like RF outperform One-Class SVM in capturing\\nfine-grained user-specific patterns.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T07:42:05Z\"}"}
