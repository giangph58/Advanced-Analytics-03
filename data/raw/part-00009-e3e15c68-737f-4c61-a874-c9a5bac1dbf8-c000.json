We investigated DC voltage-biased\\nplanar Josephson junctions built upon epitaxial Al/InAs heterostructures in\\nwhich the intrinsic AC Josephson effect is theoretically expected to provide a\\ntime-periodic drive leading to Floquet hybridization. Tunneling spectroscopy is\\nperformed using probes positioned at the ends of the junction to study the\\nevolution of the local density of states. With applied drive, we observe\\nmultiple coherence peaks which are studied as a function of DC voltage bias and\\nin-plane magnetic field. Our analysis suggests that these spectral gaps arise\\nfrom a direct mesoscopic coupling between the tunneling probe and the\\nsuperconducting leads rather than from a Floquet-driven gap opening. Our\\nnumerical simulations indicate that an increase in the ratio of junction width\\nto coherence length will enhance the contribution of Floquet hybridization.\\nThis work lays a foundation for the exploration of Floquet physics utilizing\\nvoltage-biased hybrid superconductor-semiconductor Josephson junctions and\\nprovides means for distinguishing direct couplings from genuine Floquet\\neffects.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T17:44:06Z\"}"}
