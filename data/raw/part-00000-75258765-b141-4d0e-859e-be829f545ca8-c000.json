However, the safety and\\nrobustness assessment of autonomous driving has not received sufficient\\nattention. Current evaluations of autonomous driving are typically conducted in\\nnatural driving scenarios. However, many accidents often occur in edge cases,\\nalso known as safety-critical scenarios. These safety-critical scenarios are\\ndifficult to collect, and there is currently no clear definition of what\\nconstitutes a safety-critical scenario. In this work, we explore the safety and\\nrobustness of autonomous driving in safety-critical scenarios. First, we\\nprovide a definition of safety-critical scenarios, including static traffic\\nscenarios such as adversarial attack scenarios and natural distribution shifts,\\nas well as dynamic traffic scenarios such as accident scenarios. Then, we\\ndevelop an autonomous driving safety testing platform to comprehensively\\nevaluate autonomous driving systems, encompassing not only the assessment of\\nperception modules but also system-level evaluations. Our work systematically\\nconstructs a safety verification process for autonomous driving, providing\\ntechnical support for the industry to establish standardized test framework and\\nreduce risks in real-world road deployment.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T04:13:32Z\"}"}
