{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02455v1\", \"title\": \"QPanda3: A High-Performance Software-Hardware Collaborative Framework\\n  for Large-Scale Quantum-Classical Computing Integration\", \"summary\": \"QPanda3 is a high-performance quantum programming framework that enhances\\nquantum computing efficiency through optimized circuit compilation, an advanced\\ninstruction stream format (OriginBIS), and hardware-aware execution strategies.\\nThese engineering optimizations significantly improve both processing speed and\\nsystem performance, addressing key challenges in the NISQ era. A core\\ninnovation, OriginBIS, accelerates encoding speeds by up to 86.9x compared to\\nOpenQASM 2.0, while decoding is 35.6x faster, leading to more efficient data\\nhandling, reduced memory overhead, and improved communication efficiency. This\\ndirectly enhances the execution of quantum circuits, making large-scale quantum\\nsimulations more feasible. Comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates QPanda3's\\nsuperior performance: quantum circuit construction is 20.7x faster, execution\\nspeeds improve by 3.4x, and transpilation efficiency increases by 14.97x over\\nQiskit. Notably, in compiling a 118-qubit W-state circuit on a 2D-grid\\ntopology, QPanda3 achieves an unprecedented 869.9x speedup, underscoring its\\nability to handle complex quantum workloads at scale. By combining high-speed\\nquantum processing with a modular and extensible software architecture, QPanda3\\nprovides a practical bridge between today's NISQ devices and future\\nfault-tolerant quantum computing. It facilitates real-world applications in\\nfinancial modeling, materials science, and combinatorial optimization, while\\nits robust and scalable design supports industrial adoption and cloud-based\\ndeployment.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.PL\", \"categories\": \"cs.PL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T10:20:16Z\"}"}
