{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00528v1\", \"title\": \"An Analytic Zeta Function Ramp at the Black Hole Thouless Time\", \"summary\": \"Black hole normal modes have intriguing connections to logarithmic spectra,\\nand the spectral form factor (SFF) of $E_n = \\\\log n$ is the mod square of the\\nRiemann zeta function (RZF). In this paper, we first provide an analytic\\nunderstanding of the dip-ramp-plateau structure of RZF and show that the ramp\\nat $\\\\beta \\\\equiv \\\\Re(s)=0$ has a slope precisely equal to 1. The $s=1$ pole of\\nRZF can be viewed as due to a Hagedorn transition in this setting, and\\nRiemann's analytic continuation to $\\\\Re(s)< 1$ provides the quantum\\ncontribution to the truncated $\\\\log n$ partition function. This perspective\\nyields a precise definition of RZF as the ''full ramp after removal of the\\ndip'', and allows an unambiguous determination of the Thouless time. For black\\nhole microstates, the Thouless time is expected to be\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}(1)$--remarkably, the RZF also exhibits this behavior. To our\\nknowledge, this is the first black hole-inspired toy model that has a\\ndemonstrably $\\\\mathcal{O}(1)$ Thouless time. In contrast, it is\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\log N)$ in the SYK model and expected to be $\\\\mathcal{O}(N^{\\\\#})$\\nin supergravity fuzzballs. We trace the origins of the ramp to a certain\\nreflection property of the functional equation satisfied by RZF, and suggest\\nthat it is a general feature of $L$-functions--we find evidence for ramps in\\nlarge classes of $L$-functions. As an aside, we also provide an analytic\\ndetermination of the slopes of (non-linear) ramps that arise in power law\\nspectra using Poisson resummation techniques.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T13:54:37Z\"}"}
