Capabilities define the\\nfunctions of resources in a machine-readable form and skills provide the\\nconcrete implementations that realize those capabilities. However, the\\ndevelopment of a skill implementation conforming to a corresponding capability\\nremains a time-consuming and challenging task. In this paper, we present a\\nmethod that treats capabilities as contracts for skill implementations and\\nleverages large language models to generate executable code based on natural\\nlanguage user input. A key feature of our approach is the integration of\\nexisting software libraries and interface technologies, enabling the generation\\nof skill implementations across different target languages. We introduce a\\nframework that allows users to incorporate their own libraries and resource\\ninterfaces into the code generation process through a retrieval-augmented\\ngeneration architecture. The proposed method is evaluated using an autonomous\\nmobile robot controlled via Python and ROS 2, demonstrating the feasibility and\\nflexibility of the approach.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.RO,cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:27:04Z\"}"}
