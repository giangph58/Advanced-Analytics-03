In this paper, we\\nview shape optimization as optimization on Riemannian shape manifolds. We\\nconsider so-called outer metrics on the diffeomorphism group to solve\\nPDE-constrained shape optimization problems efficiently. Commonly, the\\nnumerical solution of such problems relies on the Riemannian version of the\\nsteepest descent method. One key difference between this version and the\\nstandard method is that iterates are updated via geodesics or retractions. Due\\nto the lack of explicit expressions for geodesics, for most of the previously\\nproposed metrics, very limited progress has been made in this direction.\\nLeveraging the existence of explicit expressions for the geodesic equations\\nassociated to the outer metrics on the diffeomorphism group, we aim to study\\nthe viability of using such equations in the context of PDE-constrained shape\\noptimization. However, solving geodesic equations is computationally\\nchallenging and often restrictive. Therefore, this paper discusses potential\\nnumerical approaches to simplify the numerical burden of using geodesics,\\nmaking the proposed method computationally competitive with previously\\nestablished methods.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T10:07:20Z\"}"}
