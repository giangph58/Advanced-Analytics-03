{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05202v1\", \"title\": \"Switching Dynamics of Metastable Open Quantum Systems\", \"summary\": \"Classical metastability manifests as noise-driven switching between disjoint\\nbasins of attraction and slowing down of relaxation, quantum systems like\\nqubits and Rydberg atoms exhibit analogous behavior through collective quantum\\njumps and long-lived Liouvillian modes with a small spectral gap. Though any\\nmetastable mode is expected to decay after a finite time, stochastic switching\\npersists indefinitely. Here, we elaborate on the connection between switching\\ndynamics and quantum metastability through the lens of the large deviation\\nprinciples, spectral decomposition, and quantum-jump simulations. Specifically,\\nwe distinguish the trajectory-level noise-induced metastability (stochastic\\nswitching) from the spectrum-level deterministic metastability (small\\nLiouvillian gap) in a Markovian open quantum system with bistability. Without\\nstochastic switching, whether a small spectral gap leads to slow relaxation\\ndepends on initial states. In contrast, with switching, the memory of initial\\nconditions is quickly lost, and the relaxation is limited by the rare switching\\nbetween the metastable states. Consistent with the exponential scaling of the\\nLiouvillian gap with system size, the switching rates conform to the Arrhenius\\nlaw, with the inverse system size serving as the nonequilibrium analog of\\ntemperature. Using the dynamical path integral and the instanton approach, we\\nfurther extend the connection between the quasipotential functional and the\\nprobabilities of rare fluctuations to the quantum realm. These results provide\\nnew insights into quantum bistability and the relaxation processes of strongly\\ninteracting, dissipative quantum systems far away from the thermodynamic limit.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:00:19Z\"}"}
