{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16553v1\", \"title\": \"Least-Squares-Embedded Optimization for Accelerated Convergence of PINNs\\n  in Acoustic Wavefield Simulations\", \"summary\": \"Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have shown promise in solving\\npartial differential equations (PDEs), including the frequency-domain Helmholtz\\nequation. However, standard training of PINNs using gradient descent (GD)\\nsuffers from slow convergence and instability, particularly for high-frequency\\nwavefields. For scattered acoustic wavefield simulation based on Helmholtz\\nequation, we derive a hybrid optimization framework that accelerates training\\nconvergence by embedding a least-squares (LS) solver directly into the GD loss\\nfunction. This formulation enables optimal updates for the linear output layer.\\nOur method is applicable with or without perfectly matched layers (PML), and we\\nprovide practical tensor-based implementations for both scenarios. Numerical\\nexperiments on benchmark velocity models demonstrate that our approach achieves\\nfaster convergence, higher accuracy, and improved stability compared to\\nconventional PINN training. In particular, our results show that the\\nLS-enhanced method converges rapidly even in cases where standard GD-based\\ntraining fails. The LS solver operates on a small normal matrix, ensuring\\nminimal computational overhead and making the method scalable for large-scale\\nwavefield simulations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,physics.comp-ph,physics.geo-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T09:32:14Z\"}"}
