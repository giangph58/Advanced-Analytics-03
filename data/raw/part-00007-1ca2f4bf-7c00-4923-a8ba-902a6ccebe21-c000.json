We find that the unidentified high-temperature ordered phase\\nunder the magnetic field H ||[001] reported earlier can be interpreted as the\\nconsequence of the internal rotation in the orbital moments of f electrons at\\nthe Pr site. We discuss the phase diagram for various magnetic-field directions\\nand also possible double-q quadrupolar orders in this system.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T13:33:38Z\"}"}
