{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10828v1\", \"title\": \"Following Is All You Need: Robot Crowd Navigation Using People As\\n  Planners\", \"summary\": \"Navigating in crowded environments requires the robot to be equipped with\\nhigh-level reasoning and planning techniques. Existing works focus on\\ndeveloping complex and heavyweight planners while ignoring the role of human\\nintelligence. Since humans are highly capable agents who are also widely\\navailable in a crowd navigation setting, we propose an alternative scheme where\\nthe robot utilises people as planners to benefit from their effective planning\\ndecisions and social behaviours. Through a set of rule-based evaluations, we\\nidentify suitable human leaders who exhibit the potential to guide the robot\\ntowards its goal. Using a simple base planner, the robot follows the selected\\nleader through shorthorizon subgoals that are designed to be straightforward to\\nachieve. We demonstrate through both simulated and real-world experiments that\\nour novel framework generates safe and efficient robot plans compared to\\nexisting planners, even without predictive or data-driven modules. Our method\\nalso brings human-like robot behaviours without explicitly defining traffic\\nrules and social norms.
