{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02528v1\", \"title\": \"RAFFLE: Active learning accelerated interface structure prediction\", \"summary\": \"Interfaces between materials play a crucial role in the performance of most\\ndevices. However, predicting the structure of a material interface is\\ncomputationally demanding due to the vast configuration space, which requires\\nevaluating an unfeasibly large number of highly complex structures. We\\nintroduce RAFFLE, a software package designed to efficiently explore low-energy\\ninterface configurations between any two crystals. RAFFLE leverages physical\\ninsights and genetic algorithms to intelligently sample the configuration\\nspace, using dynamically evolving 2-, 3-, and 4-body distribution functions as\\ngeneralised structural descriptors. These descriptors are iteratively updated\\nthrough active learning, which inform atom placement strategies. RAFFLE's\\neffectiveness is demonstrated across a diverse set of systems, including bulk\\nmaterials, intercalation structures, and interfaces. When tested on bulk\\naluminium and MoS$_2$, it successfully identifies known ground-state and\\nhigh-pressure phases. Applied to intercalation systems, it predicts stable\\nintercalant phases. For Si|Ge interfaces, RAFFLE identifies intermixing as a\\nstrain compensation mechanism, generating reconstructions that are more stable\\nthan abrupt interfaces. By accelerating interface structure prediction, RAFFLE\\noffers a powerful tool for materials discovery, enabling efficient exploration\\nof complex configuration spaces.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.dis-nn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T12:33:31Z\"}"}
