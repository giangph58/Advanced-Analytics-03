Nevertheless, they achieve biased solutions,\\nrequiring many iterations to converge. This work addresses these issues through\\na suitable feedback control of the algorithm's hyperparameter. Specifically, by\\ndesigning an integral control that does not substantially impact the\\ncomputational complexity, we can reach an unbiased solution in a reasonable\\nnumber of iterations. In the paper, we develop and analyze the convergence of\\nthe proposed approach for strongly-convex problems. Moreover, numerical\\nsimulations validate and extend the theoretical results to the non-strongly\\nconvex framework.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T10:17:32Z\"}"}
