The model represents a flexible approach\\nthat captures important regularities that might be detected when thousands or\\nmillions of people are observed, i.e. bigger origins and bigger destinations\\nincrease the intensity of interactions, but it tends to decay with longer\\ndistances between them. Therefore, the number of interactions between two\\nlocations is frequently modelled with an equation that resembles Newton's Law\\nof Gravitation (also known as the Law of Gravity). Here, I explore different\\naspects, i.e. essential components, techniques for estimating the parameters,\\ninterpretation of results, and settings where gravity is a helpful tool,\\nincluding mobility and migration.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T10:41:54Z\"}"}
