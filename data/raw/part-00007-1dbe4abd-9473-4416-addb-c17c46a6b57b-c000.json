Although large language models\\n(LLMs) have obtained remarkable progress on ESC, most of these studies might\\nnot define the diagram from the state model perspective, therefore providing a\\nsuboptimal solution for long-term satisfaction. To address such an issue, we\\nleverage the Finite State Machine (FSM) on LLMs, and propose a framework called\\nFiSMiness. Our framework allows a single LLM to bootstrap the planning during\\nESC, and self-reason the seeker's emotion, support strategy and the final\\nresponse upon each conversational turn. Substantial experiments on ESC datasets\\nsuggest that FiSMiness outperforms many baselines, including direct inference,\\nself-refine, chain of thought, finetuning, and external-assisted methods, even\\nthose with many more parameters.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T07:52:06Z\"}"}
