The model is the Dyson-Schwinger Equations in Rainbow-Ladder truncation.\\nFor the parton mass/energy distributions as a function of momentum transfer, we\\ndirectly calculate matrix elements of the Energy-Momentum Tensor by utilizing\\nits similarity to the momentum fraction moment of GPDs associated with deep\\ninelastic scattering. A variety of gravitational form factors are obtained\\nincluding the D-term.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T15:15:29Z\"}"}
