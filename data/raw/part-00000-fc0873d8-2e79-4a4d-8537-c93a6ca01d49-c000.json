Our key finding is a\\nsystematic way to identify heat kernel coefficients in the angular momentum\\nspace. We explicitly obtain the formulas up to sixth order in the heat kernel\\nexpansion, which suffice to regularize functional determinants in up to 13\\ndimensions. We find that the heat kernel coefficients accurately approximate\\nthe large angular momentum dependence of functional determinants, and make\\nnumerical computations more efficient. In the limit of a large angular\\nmomentum, our formulas reduce to the WKB formulas in previous studies, but\\nextended to higher orders. All the results are available in both the zeta\\nfunction regularization and the dimensional regularization.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T11:06:21Z\"}"}
