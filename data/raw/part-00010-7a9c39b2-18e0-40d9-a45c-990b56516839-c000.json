{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20892v1\", \"title\": \"Imaging on the Edge: Mapping Object Corners and Edges with Stereo X-ray\\n  Tomography\", \"summary\": \"X-ray computed tomography is a powerful tool for volumetric imaging, where\\nthree-dimensional (3D) images are generated from a large number of individual\\nX-ray projection images. Collecting the required number of low noise projection\\nimages is however time-consuming and so the technique is not currently\\napplicable when spatial information needs to be collected with high temporal\\nresolution, such as in the study of dynamic processes. In our previous work,\\ninspired by stereo vision, we developed stereo X-ray imaging methods that\\noperate with only two X-ray projection images. Previously we have shown how\\nthis allowed us to map point and line fiducial markers into 3D space at\\nsignificantly faster temporal resolutions. In this paper, we make two further\\ncontributions. Firstly, instead of utilising internal fiducial markers, we\\ndemonstrate the applicability of the method to the 3D mapping of sharp object\\ncorners, a problem of interest in measuring the deformation of manufactured\\ncomponents under different loads. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the approach\\ncan be applied to real stereo X-ray data, even in settings where we do not have\\nthe annotated real training data that was required for the training of our\\nprevious Machine Learning approach. This is achieved by substituting the real\\ndata with a relatively simple synthetic training dataset designed to mimic key\\naspects of the real data.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T16:08:00Z\"}"}
