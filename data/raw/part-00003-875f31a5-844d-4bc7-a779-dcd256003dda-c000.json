{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10393v1\", \"title\": \"Quantum Liouvillian Tomography\", \"summary\": \"Characterization of near-term quantum computing platforms requires the\\nability to capture and quantify dissipative effects. This is an inherently\\nchallenging task, as these effects are multifaceted, spanning a broad spectrum\\nfrom Markovian to strongly non-Markovian dynamics. We introduce Quantum\\nLiouvillian Tomography (QLT), a protocol to capture and quantify non-Markovian\\neffects in time-continuous quantum dynamics. The protocol leverages\\ngradient-based quantum process tomography to reconstruct dynamical maps and\\nutilizes regression over the derivatives of Pauli string probability\\ndistributions to extract the Liouvillian governing the dynamics. We benchmark\\nthe protocol using synthetic data and quantify its accuracy in recovering\\nHamiltonians, jump operators, and dissipation rates for two-qubit systems.\\nFinally, we apply QLT to analyze the evolution of an idling two-qubit system\\nimplemented on a superconducting quantum platform to extract characteristics of\\nHamiltonian and dissipative components and, as a result, detect inherently\\nnon-Markovian dynamics. Our work introduces the first protocol capable of\\nretrieving generators of generic open quantum evolution from experimental data,\\nthus enabling more precise characterization of many-body non-Markovian effects\\nin near-term quantum computing platforms.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.other\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:42:17Z\"}"}
