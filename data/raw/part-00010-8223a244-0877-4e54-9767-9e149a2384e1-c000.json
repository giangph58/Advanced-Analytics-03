Yet, clustering complex datasets containing critically intertwined\\nshapes poses significant challenges. The prevailing clustering algorithms\\nwidely depend on evaluating similarity measures based on Euclidean metrics.\\nExploring topological characteristics to perform clustering of complex datasets\\ninevitably presents a better scope. The topological clustering algorithms\\npredominantly perceive the point set through the lens of Simplicial complexes\\nand Persistent homology. Despite these approaches, the existing topological\\nclustering algorithms cannot somehow fully exploit topological structures and\\nshow inconsistent performances on some highly complicated datasets. This work\\naims to mitigate the limitations by identifying topologically similar neighbors\\nthrough the Vietoris-Rips complex and Betti number filtration. In addition, we\\nintroduce the concept of the Betti sequences to capture flexibly essential\\nfeatures from the topological structures. Our proposed algorithm is adept at\\nclustering complex, intertwined shapes contained in the datasets. We carried\\nout experiments on several synthetic and real-world datasets. Our algorithm\\ndemonstrated commendable performances across the datasets compared to some of\\nthe well-known topology-based clustering algorithms.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T11:46:02Z\"}"}
