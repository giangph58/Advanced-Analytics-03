{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15734v1\", \"title\": \"Compact vacuum levitation and control platform with a single 3D-printed\\n  fiber lens\", \"summary\": \"Levitated dielectric particles in a vacuum have emerged as a new platform in\\nquantum science, with applications in precision acceleration and force sensing,\\nas well as testing quantum physics beyond the microscopic domain.\\nTraditionally, particle levitation relies on optical tweezers formed by tightly\\nfocused laser beams, which often require multiple bulk optical elements aligned\\nin free space, limiting robustness and scalability. To address these\\nchallenges, we employ a single optical fiber with a high numerical aperture\\n(NA) lens directly printed onto the fiber facet. This enables a compact yet\\nrobust optical levitation and detection system composed entirely of fiber-based\\ncomponents, eliminating the need for complex alignment. The high NA of the\\nprinted lens enables stable single-beam trapping of a dielectric nanoparticle\\nin a vacuum, even while the fiber is in controlled motion. The high NA also\\nallows for the collection of scattered light from the particle with excellent\\ncollection efficiency, thus efficient detection and feedback stabilization of\\nthe particle's motion. Our platform paves the way for practical and portable\\nsensors based on levitated particles and provides simple yet elegant solutions\\nto complex experiments requiring the integration of levitated particles.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,physics.app-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T09:25:52Z\"}"}
