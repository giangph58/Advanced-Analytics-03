We\\ncompute this holographic correlator in the large $N$ and finite $\\\\tau$\\nexpansion using constraints from derivatives of the mass deformed sphere free\\nenergy, which we compute using supersymmetric localization at large $N$ and\\nfinite $\\\\tau$ in terms of modular invariant non-holomorphic Eisenstein series.\\nIn particular, we combine this constraint with the known flat space limit to\\nfix the $R^2F^2$ higher derivative correction to the correlator in terms of the\\nweight one non-holomorphic Eisenstein series, and also to fix the logarithmic\\nthreshold. We also compute the one-loop correction to the correlator, and match\\nit to the expected flat space limit result.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T15:27:59Z\"}"}
