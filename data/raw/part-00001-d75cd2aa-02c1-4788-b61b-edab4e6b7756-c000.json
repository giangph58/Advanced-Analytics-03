Predicting Signatures of Large-scale Turbulence in\\n  Protoplanetary Disks\", \"summary\": \"Turbulent gas motions drive planet formation and protoplanetary disk\\nevolution. However, empirical constraints on turbulence are scarce, halting our\\nunderstanding of its nature. Resolving signatures of the large-scale\\nperturbations driven by disk instabilities may reveal clues on the origin of\\nturbulence in the outer regions of planet-forming disks. We aim to predict the\\nobservational signatures of such large-scale flows, as they would appear in\\nhigh-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of CO\\nrotational lines, such as those conducted by the exoALMA Large Program.\\nPost-processing 3D numerical simulations, we explored the observational\\nsignatures produced by three candidate (magneto-)hydrodynamical instabilities\\nto operate in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks: the vertical shear\\ninstability (VSI), the magneto-rotational instability (MRI), and the\\ngravitational instability (GI). We found that exoALMA-quality observations\\nshould capture signatures of the large-scale motions induced by these\\ninstabilities. Mainly, flows with ring, arc, and spiral morphologies are\\napparent in the residuals of synthetic velocity centroid maps. A qualitative\\ncomparison between our predictions and the perturbations recovered from exoALMA\\ndata suggests the presence of two laminar disks and a scarcity of ring- and\\narc-like VSI signatures within the sample. Spiral features produced by the MRI\\nor the GI are still plausible in explaining observed disk perturbations.\\nSupporting these scenarios requires further methodically comparing the\\npredicted perturbations and the observed disks' complex dynamic structure.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:47:30Z\"}"}
