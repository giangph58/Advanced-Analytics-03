However, the lack of paired raw-ground truth (raw-GT) data in the real\\nworld poses challenges for generalized depth recovery. Existing methods\\ninsufficiently consider the diversity of structure misalignment in raw depth\\nmaps, which leads to poor generalization in real-world depth recovery. Notably,\\nrandom structure misalignments are not limited to raw depth data but also\\naffect GT depth in real-world datasets. In the proposed method, we tackle the\\ngeneralization problem from both input and output perspectives. For input, we\\nenrich the diversity of structure misalignment in raw depth maps by designing a\\nnew raw depth generation pipeline, which helps the network avoid overfitting to\\na specific condition. Furthermore, a structure uncertainty module is designed\\nto explicitly identify the misaligned structure for input raw depth maps to\\nbetter generalize in unseen scenarios. Notably the well-trained depth\\nfoundation model (DFM) can help the structure uncertainty module estimate the\\nstructure uncertainty better. For output, a robust feature alignment module is\\ndesigned to precisely align with the accurate structure of RGB images avoiding\\nthe interference of inaccurate GT depth. Extensive experiments on multiple\\ndatasets demonstrate the proposed method achieves competitive accuracy and\\ngeneralization capabilities across various challenging raw depth maps.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T07:14:01Z\"}"}
