{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21777v1\", \"title\": \"Near-Optimal Distributed Ruling Sets for Trees and High-Girth Graphs\", \"summary\": \"Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, a $\\\\beta$-ruling set is a subset $S\\\\subseteq V$ that\\nis i) independent, and ii) every node $v\\\\in V$ has a node of $S$ within\\ndistance $\\\\beta$. In this paper we present almost optimal distributed\\nalgorithms for finding ruling sets in trees and high girth graphs in the\\nclassic LOCAL model. As our first contribution we present an $O(\\\\log\\\\log\\nn)$-round randomized algorithm for computing $2$-ruling sets on trees, almost\\nmatching the $\\\\Omega(\\\\log\\\\log n/\\\\log\\\\log\\\\log n)$ lower bound given by Balliu et\\nal. [FOCS'20]. Second, we show that $2$-ruling sets can be solved in\\n$\\\\widetilde{O}(\\\\log^{5/3}\\\\log n)$ rounds in high-girth graphs. Lastly, we show\\nthat $O(\\\\log\\\\log\\\\log n)$-ruling sets can be computed in $\\\\widetilde{O}(\\\\log\\\\log\\nn)$ rounds in high-girth graphs matching the lower bound up to triple-log\\nfactors. All of these results either improve polynomially or exponentially on\\nthe previously best algorithms and use a smaller domination distance $\\\\beta$.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS,cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T16:29:14Z\"}"}
