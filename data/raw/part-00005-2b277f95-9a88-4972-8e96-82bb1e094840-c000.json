However, there are concerns about the accuracy and consistency of the\\noutputs of generative AI. We have carried out an exploratory study on the\\napplication of this new technology in research data processing. We identified\\ntasks for which rule-based or traditional machine learning approaches were\\ndifficult to apply, and then performed these tasks using generative AI.\\n  We demonstrate the feasibility of using the generative AI model Claude 3 Opus\\nin three research projects involving complex data processing tasks:\\n  1) Information extraction: We extract plant species names from historical\\nseedlists (catalogues of seeds) published by botanical gardens.\\n  2) Natural language understanding: We extract certain data points (name of\\ndrug, name of health indication, relative effectiveness, cost-effectiveness,\\netc.) from documents published by Health Technology Assessment organisations in\\nthe EU.\\n  3) Text classification: We assign industry codes to projects on the\\ncrowdfunding website Kickstarter.\\n  We share the lessons we learnt from these use cases: How to determine if\\ngenerative AI is an appropriate tool for a given data processing task, and if\\nso, how to maximise the accuracy and consistency of the results obtained.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,I.2.7\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T12:21:07Z\"}"}
