{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06021v1\", \"title\": \"Memory-Modular Classification: Learning to Generalize with Memory\\n  Replacement\", \"summary\": \"We propose a novel memory-modular learner for image classification that\\nseparates knowledge memorization from reasoning. Our model enables effective\\ngeneralization to new classes by simply replacing the memory contents, without\\nthe need for model retraining. Unlike traditional models that encode both world\\nknowledge and task-specific skills into their weights during training, our\\nmodel stores knowledge in the external memory of web-crawled image and text\\ndata. At inference time, the model dynamically selects relevant content from\\nthe memory based on the input image, allowing it to adapt to arbitrary classes\\nby simply replacing the memory contents. The key differentiator that our\\nlearner meta-learns to perform classification tasks with noisy web data from\\nunseen classes, resulting in robust performance across various classification\\nscenarios. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance and\\nversatility of our approach in handling diverse classification tasks, including\\nzero-shot/few-shot classification of unseen classes, fine-grained\\nclassification, and class-incremental classification.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:26:24Z\"}"}
