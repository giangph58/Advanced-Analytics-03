{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13042v1\", \"title\": \"Event-Enhanced Blurry Video Super-Resolution\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we tackle the task of blurry video super-resolution (BVSR),\\naiming to generate high-resolution (HR) videos from low-resolution (LR) and\\nblurry inputs. Current BVSR methods often fail to restore sharp details at high\\nresolutions, resulting in noticeable artifacts and jitter due to insufficient\\nmotion information for deconvolution and the lack of high-frequency details in\\nLR frames. To address these challenges, we introduce event signals into BVSR\\nand propose a novel event-enhanced network, Ev-DeblurVSR. To effectively fuse\\ninformation from frames and events for feature deblurring, we introduce a\\nreciprocal feature deblurring module that leverages motion information from\\nintra-frame events to deblur frame features while reciprocally using global\\nscene context from the frames to enhance event features. Furthermore, to\\nenhance temporal consistency, we propose a hybrid deformable alignment module\\nthat fully exploits the complementary motion information from inter-frame\\nevents and optical flow to improve motion estimation in the deformable\\nalignment process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Ev-DeblurVSR\\nestablishes a new state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world\\ndatasets. Notably, on real data, our method is +2.59 dB more accurate and\\n7.28$\\\\times$ faster than the recent best BVSR baseline FMA-Net.
