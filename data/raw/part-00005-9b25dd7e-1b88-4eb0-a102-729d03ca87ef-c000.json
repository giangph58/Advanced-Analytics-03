Cosmological models are constructed considering\\ndifferent functional of $f(Q)$ gravity where $Q$ in the gravitational action.\\nWe obtain cosmological model probing late universe with a constant jerk\\nparameter. The observational constraints that are imposed on the model\\nparameters for a realistic scenario estimated using the observational Hubble\\ndata and the Pantheon dataset. The evolution of the deceleration parameter,\\nenergy density and the equation of state (EoS) parameter are also explored. The\\ntransition of the universe from a deceleration to an accelerating phase is\\ninvestigated in different framework of $f(Q)$ theories. We also analyzed the\\nvariation of the effective EoS parameter and found that the matter content in\\nthe universe favours quintessence type fluid in all the $f(Q)$-gravity. The\\nenergy conditions for a realistic scenario are examined and noted that the\\neffective fluid violates the strong energy condition.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T08:04:29Z\"}"}
