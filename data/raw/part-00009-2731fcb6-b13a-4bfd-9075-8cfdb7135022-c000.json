{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07875v1\", \"title\": \"QubitHammer Attacks: Qubit Flipping Attacks in Multi-tenant\\n  Superconducting Quantum Computers\", \"summary\": \"Quantum computing is rapidly evolving its capabilities, with a corresponding\\nsurge in its deployment within cloud-based environments. Various quantum\\ncomputers are accessible today via pay-as-you-go cloud computing models,\\noffering unprecedented convenience. Due to its rapidly growing demand, quantum\\ncomputers are shifting from a single-tenant to a multi-tenant model to enhance\\nresource utilization. However, this widespread accessibility to shared\\nmulti-tenant systems also introduces potential security vulnerabilities. In\\nthis work, we present for the first time a set of novel attacks, named together\\nas the QubitHammer attacks, which target state-of-the-art superconducting\\nquantum computers. We show that in a multi-tenant cloud-based quantum system,\\nan adversary with the basic capability to deploy custom pulses, similar to any\\nstandard user today, can utilize the QubitHammer attacks to significantly\\ndegrade the fidelity of victim circuits located on the same quantum computer.\\nUpon extensive evaluation, the QubitHammer attacks achieve a very high\\nvariational distance of up to 0.938 from the expected outcome, thus\\ndemonstrating their potential to degrade victim computation. Our findings\\nexhibit the effectiveness of these attacks across various superconducting\\nquantum computers from a leading vendor, suggesting that QubitHammer represents\\na new class of security attacks. Further, the attacks are demonstrated to\\nbypass all existing defenses proposed so far for ensuring the reliability in\\nmulti-tenant superconducting quantum computers.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:50:57Z\"}"}
