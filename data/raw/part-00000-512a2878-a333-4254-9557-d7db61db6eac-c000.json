{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21397v1\", \"title\": \"Coping with Uncertainty in UX Design Practice: Practitioner Strategies\\n  and Judgment\", \"summary\": \"The complexity of UX design practice extends beyond ill-structured design\\nproblems to include uncertainties shaped by shifting stakeholder priorities,\\nteam dynamics, limited resources, and implementation constraints. While prior\\nresearch in related fields has addressed uncertainty in design more broadly,\\nthe specific character of uncertainty in UX practice remains underexplored.\\nThis study examines how UX practitioners experience and respond to uncertainty\\nin real-world projects, drawing on a multi-week diary study and follow-up\\ninterviews with ten designers. We identify a range of practitioner\\nstrategies-including adaptive framing, negotiation, and judgment-that allow\\ndesigners to move forward amid ambiguity. Our findings highlight the central\\nrole of design judgment in navigating uncertainty, including emergent forms\\nsuch as temporal and sacrificial judgment, and extend prior understandings by\\nshowing how UX practitioners engage uncertainty as a persistent, situated\\nfeature of practice.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T07:53:18Z\"}"}
