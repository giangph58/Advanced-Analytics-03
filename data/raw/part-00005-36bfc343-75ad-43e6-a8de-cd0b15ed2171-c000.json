This\\nreview highlights applications of stellar polarimetry for massive hot stars,\\nparticularly in the context of ultraviolet (UV) spaceborne missions. The\\nprevalence of binarity in the massive star population and uncertainties\\nregarding the degree of rotational criticality among hot stars raises important\\nquestions about stellar interactions, interior structure, and even the\\nlifetimes of evolutionary phases. These uncertainties have consequences for\\nstellar population synthesis calculations. Spectropolarimetry is a key tool for\\nextracting information about stellar and binary geometries. We review\\nmethodologies involving electron scattering in circumstellar envelopes; gravity\\ndarkening from rapid rotation; spectral line effects including the (a) \\\"line\\neffect\\\", (b) Ohman effect, and (c) Hanle effect; and the imprint of\\ninterstellar polarization on measurements. Finally, we describe the Polstar UV\\nspectropolarimetric SMEX mission concept as one means for employing these\\ndiagnostics to clarify the state of high rotation and its impacts for massive\\nstars.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:56:08Z\"}"}
