First, we represent the\\nsolution of the differential equation as a double series expansion. On the\\n2-node quiver gauge theory side, this corresponds to the instanton series. We\\nthen demonstrate that the expansion coefficients are uniquely determined by a\\nrecursion relation. Inspired by the approach initiated in a paper by D. Gaiotto\\nand J. Teschner, we partially resum this series and show that the result can be\\nelegantly expressed in terms of a single hypergeometric function and its\\nderivative. This new representation makes it straightforward to relate\\ndifferent asymptotic regions. As a by-product, this provides us a simple\\nderivation of fusion and braiding coefficients.\\n  We describe the subtle procedure of merging the degenerate field with the\\noutgoing state, thereby obtaining a generic 4-point block, which on the gauge\\ntheory side corresponds to the partition function of $SU(2)$ gauge theory with\\nfour massive hypermultiplets in the $\\\\Omega$-background.\\n  Finally, we performed several nontrivial checks, which confirm our results.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T09:56:43Z\"}"}
