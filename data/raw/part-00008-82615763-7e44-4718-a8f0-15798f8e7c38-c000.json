{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10379v1\", \"title\": \"Minimal surfaces in strongly correlated random environments\", \"summary\": \"A minimal surface in a random environment (MSRE) is a $d$-dimensional surface\\nin $(d+n)$-dimensional space which minimizes the sum of its elastic energy and\\nits environment potential energy, subject to prescribed boundary values. Apart\\nfrom their intrinsic interest, such surfaces are further motivated by\\nconnections with disordered spin systems and first-passage percolation models.\\nIn this work, we consider the case of strongly correlated environments,\\nrealized by the model of harmonic MSRE in a fractional Brownian environment of\\nHurst parameter $H\\\\in(0,1)$. This includes the case of Brownian environment\\n($H=1/2$ and $n=1$), which is commonly used to approximate the domain walls of\\nthe $(d+1)$-dimensional random-field Ising model.\\n  We prove that surfaces of dimension $d\\\\in\\\\{1,2,3\\\\}$ delocalize with power-law\\nfluctuations, and determine their precise transversal and minimal energy\\nfluctuation exponents, as well as the stretched exponential exponents governing\\nthe tail decay of their distributions. These exponents are found to be the same\\nin all codimensions $n$, depending only on $d$ and $H$. The transversal and\\nminimal energy fluctuation exponents are specified by two scaling relations.\\n  We further show that surfaces of dimension $d=4$ delocalize with\\nsub-power-law fluctuations, with their height and minimal energy fluctuations\\ntied by a scaling relation. Lastly, we prove that surfaces of dimensions $d\\\\ge\\n5$ localize.\\n  These results put several predictions from the physics literature on\\nmathematically rigorous ground.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:25:09Z\"}"}
