{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13053v1\", \"title\": \"Quantitative Resolvent and Eigenfunction Stability for the Faber-Krahn\\n  Inequality\", \"summary\": \"For a bounded open set $\\\\Omega \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^n$ with the same volume as\\nthe unit ball, the classical Faber-Krahn inequality says that the first\\nDirichlet eigenvalue $\\\\lambda_1(\\\\Omega)$ of the Laplacian is at least that of\\nthe unit ball $B$. We prove that the deficit $\\\\lambda_1(\\\\Omega)- \\\\lambda_1(B)$\\nin the Faber-Krahn inequality controls the square of the distance between the\\nresolvent operator $(-\\\\Delta_\\\\Omega)^{-1}$ for the Dirichlet Laplacian on\\n$\\\\Omega$ and the resolvent operator on the nearest unit ball $B(x_\\\\Omega)$. The\\ndistance is measured by the operator norm from $C^{0,\\\\alpha}$ to $L^2$. As a\\nmain application, we show that the Faber-Krahn deficit $\\\\lambda_1(\\\\Omega)-\\n\\\\lambda_1(B)$ controls the squared $L^2$ norm between $k$th eigenfunctions on\\n$\\\\Omega$ and $B(x_\\\\Omega)$ for every $k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}.$ In both of these main\\ntheorems, the quadratic power is optimal.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T16:09:26Z\"}"}
