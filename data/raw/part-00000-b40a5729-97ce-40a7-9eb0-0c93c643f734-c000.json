{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04249v1\", \"title\": \"On the Vulnerability of Underwater Magnetic Induction Communication\", \"summary\": \"Typical magnetic induction (MI) communication is commonly considered a secure\\nunderwater wireless communication (UWC) technology due to its non-audible and\\nnon-visible nature compared to acoustic and optical UWC technologies. However,\\nvulnerabilities in communication systems inevitably exist and may lead to\\ndifferent types of attacks. In this paper, we investigate the eavesdropping\\nattack in underwater MI communication to quantitatively measure the system's\\nvulnerability under this attack. We consider different potential eavesdropping\\nconfiguration setups based on the positions and orientations of the\\neavesdropper node to investigate how they impact the received voltage and\\nsecrecy at the legitimate receiver node. To this end, we develop\\nfinite-element-method-based simulation models for each configuration in an\\nunderwater environment and evaluate the received voltage and the secrecy\\ncapacity against different system parameters such as magnetic flux, magnetic\\nflux density, distance, and orientation sensitivity. Furthermore, we construct\\nan experimental setup within a laboratory environment to replicate the\\nsimulation experiments. Both simulation and lab experimental confirm the\\nsusceptibility of underwater MI communication to eavesdropping attacks.\\nHowever, this vulnerability is highly dependent on the position and orientation\\nof the coil between the eavesdropper and the legitimate transmitter. On the\\npositive side, we also observe a unique behavior in the received coil reception\\nthat might be used to detect malicious node activities in the vicinity, which\\nmight lead to a potential security mechanism against eavesdropping attacks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:53:18Z\"}"}
