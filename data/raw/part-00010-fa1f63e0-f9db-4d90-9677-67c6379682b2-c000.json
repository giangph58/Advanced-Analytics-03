Particle swarm\\noptimization (PSO) is widely adopted among SI algorithms due to its simplicity\\nand efficiency. Despite numerous learning strategies proposed to enhance PSO's\\nperformance in terms of convergence speed, robustness, and adaptability, no\\ncomprehensive and systematic analysis of these strategies exists. We review and\\nclassify various learning strategies to address this gap, assessing their\\nimpact on optimization performance. Additionally, a comparative experimental\\nevaluation is conducted to examine how these strategies influence PSO's search\\ndynamics. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future directions,\\nemphasizing the need for self-adaptive, intelligent PSO variants capable of\\naddressing increasingly complex real-world problems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NE\", \"categories\": \"cs.NE,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T06:50:02Z\"}"}
