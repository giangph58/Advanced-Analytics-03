Here we report results from\\nJWST-MIRI MRS, HST-ACS and ALMA Band 7 observations. Despite its late spectral\\ntype (M7.25), the spectrum of J0438 resembles those of inner disks around\\nearlier-type stars (K1-M5, T Tauri stars), with a volatile reservoir lacking\\nhydrocarbons (except for acetylene, C$_2$H$_2$) and dominated by water. Other\\nidentified species are H$_2$, CO$_2$, HCN, [Ar$^{+}$], and [Ne$^{+}$]. The\\ndominance of water over hydrocarbons is driven by multiple factors such as disk\\ndynamics, young disk age, low accretion rate and possible inner disk clearing.\\nJ0438 appears highly dynamic, showing a seesaw-like variability and extended\\nemission in H$_2 \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, S$(1), $S$(3), $S$(5), [Ne$^{+}$] and CO ($J=3-2$).\\nInterestingly, the CO emission reaches up to 400 au from the brown dwarf,\\nsuggesting ongoing infalling/outflowing activity impacting the disk chemistry.\\nThese observations underscore the combined power of JWST, HST and ALMA in\\ncharacterizing the chemical diversity and dynamics of brown dwarf disks.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T17:37:59Z\"}"}
