It is well known that in the Euler\\nsystem, long-time behavior of solutions is a more delicate problem due to lack\\nof the viscosity. By virtue of a damping effect, time global solutions barely\\nexist. Under such circumstances, existence of a time periodic solution is\\nobtained for sufficiently small time periodic external force when the space\\ndimension is greater than or equal to $3$. In addition, its stability is also\\nobtained. The solution is asymptotically stable under sufficiently small\\ninitial perturbations and the $L^\\\\infty$ norm of the perturbation decays as\\ntime goes to infinity. The potential theoretical estimates work well on a low\\nfrequency part of solutions, while a new energy estimate with weights is\\nestablished to avoid derivative loss.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T12:49:03Z\"}"}
