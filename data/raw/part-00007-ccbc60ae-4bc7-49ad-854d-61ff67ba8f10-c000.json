Such systems are topologically equivalent to a two-parameter family of\\ncubic systems in the plane. We show that for each pair of admissible parameters\\nthe unique equilibrium point of the corresponding system is not globally\\n(asymptotically) stable. On the other hand, we provide explicit conditions for\\nthis unique equilibrium point to be asymptotically stable and we study its\\nbasin of attraction. We also study the generic and degenerate Hopf bifurcations\\nand highlight a subset of the set of admissible parameters for which the phase\\nportraits of the systems have two limit cycles.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS,math.CA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T14:13:48Z\"}"}
