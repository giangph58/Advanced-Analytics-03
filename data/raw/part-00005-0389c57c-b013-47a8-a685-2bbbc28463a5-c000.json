We derive partial analytical results for specific quantum states\\nusing the one-way information deficit. Additionally, we present numerical\\nresults for the Bell-Mermin-Klyshko inequalities. The study reveals the\\npresence of Bell nonlocality and the significance of the one-way information\\ndeficit in relativistic quantum information.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T04:48:18Z\"}"}
