However, the basic cost of steering scattering into non-specular\\ndirections is not fully understood. This paper derives tight physical bounds on\\nanomalous scattering using antenna array systems equipped with non-local\\nmatching networks. The matching networks are explicitly synthesized based on\\nthe solutions of the optimization problems that define these bounds.\\nFurthermore, we analyze fundamental limits for metasurface antennas implemented\\nwith metallic and dielectric materials exhibiting minimal loss within a finite\\ndesign region. The results reveal a typical 6dB reduction in bistatic radar\\ncross section (RCS) in anomalous directions compared to the forward direction.\\nNumerical examples complement the theory and illustrate the inherent cost of\\nachieving anomalous scattering relative to forward or specular scattering for\\ncanonical configurations.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,cs.SY,eess.SP,eess.SY,physics.class-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T17:53:04Z\"}"}
