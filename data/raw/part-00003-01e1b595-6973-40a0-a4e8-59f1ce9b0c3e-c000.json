{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04928v1\", \"title\": \"Advanced Codebook Design for SCMA-aided NTNs With Randomly Distributed\\n  Users\", \"summary\": \"In this letter, a novel class of sparse codebooks is proposed for sparse code\\nmultiple access (SCMA) aided non-terrestrial networks (NTN) with randomly\\ndistributed users characterized by Rician fading channels. Specifically, we\\nfirst exploit the upper bound of bit error probability (BEP) of an SCMA-aided\\nNTN with large-scale fading of different users under Rician fading channels.\\nThen, the codebook is designed by employing pulse-amplitude modulation\\nconstellation, user-specific rotation and power factors. To further reduce the\\noptimization complexity while maintaining the power diversity of different\\nusers, an orthogonal layer-assisted joint layer and power assignment strategy\\nis proposed. Finally, unlike existing SCMA codebook designs that treat all\\nusers as one super-user, we propose to minimize the BEP of the worst user to\\nensure user fairness. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme is\\ncapable of providing a substantial performance gain over conventional\\ncodebooks.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:10:44Z\"}"}
