{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19882v1\", \"title\": \"Federated Out-of-Distribution Generalization: A Causal Augmentation View\", \"summary\": \"Federated learning aims to collaboratively model by integrating multi-source\\ninformation to obtain a model that can generalize across all client data.\\nExisting methods often leverage knowledge distillation or data augmentation to\\nmitigate the negative impact of data bias across clients. However, the limited\\nperformance of teacher models on out-of-distribution samples and the inherent\\nquality gap between augmented and original data hinder their effectiveness and\\nthey typically fail to leverage the advantages of incorporating rich contextual\\ninformation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a Federated\\nCausal Augmentation method, termed FedCAug, which employs causality-inspired\\ndata augmentation to break the spurious correlation between attributes and\\ncategories. Specifically, it designs a causal region localization module to\\naccurately identify and decouple the background and objects in the image,\\nproviding rich contextual information for causal data augmentation.\\nAdditionally, it designs a causality-inspired data augmentation module that\\nintegrates causal features and within-client context to generate counterfactual\\nsamples. This significantly enhances data diversity, and the entire process\\ndoes not require any information sharing between clients, thereby contributing\\nto the protection of data privacy. Extensive experiments conducted on three\\ndatasets reveal that FedCAug markedly reduces the model's reliance on\\nbackground to predict sample labels, achieving superior performance compared to\\nstate-of-the-art methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:13:48Z\"}"}
