{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06104v1\", \"title\": \"Semilinear Heat Equations in Morse-Transue Spaces and Nonlinearities of\\n  Rapid Growth\", \"summary\": \"We consider the question of well-posedness for a general class of semilinear\\nheat equations with initial data in the Morse-Transue subspace of an Orlicz\\nspace. Significantly, we obtain our results without imposing growth\\nrestrictions on the nonlinearity or the underlying space {\\\\em a priori}.\\n  The key findings are as follows: a completely new smoothing estimate for the\\naction of the heat semigroup between two arbitrary Orlicz spaces; sufficient\\nconditions for local and global (for small initial data) well-posedness in the\\nMorse-Transue space; a comparison principle in the case of monotone\\nnonlinearities; for nonlinearities enjoying additional structure (e.g.\\nconvexity) and growing sufficiently rapidly at infinity (as measured by the\\nvariation of $\\\\log f$), an explicit characterisation of a critical\\nMorse-Transue space for local well-posedness.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:48:02Z\"}"}
