While Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) addresses\\nthis challenge by generating new instances for the under-represented minority\\nclass, it faces obstacles in the form of noise and outliers during the creation\\nof new samples. In this paper, a proposed approach, iHHO-SMOTe, which addresses\\nthe limitations of SMOTE by first cleansing the data from noise points. This\\nprocess involves employing feature selection using a random forest to identify\\nthe most valuable features, followed by applying the Density-Based Spatial\\nClustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to detect outliers\\nbased on the selected features. The identified outliers from the minority\\nclasses are then removed, creating a refined dataset for subsequent\\noversampling using the hybrid approach called iHHO-SMOTe. The comprehensive\\nexperiments across diverse datasets demonstrate the exceptional performance of\\nthe proposed model, with an AUC score exceeding 0.99, a high G-means score of\\n0.99 highlighting its robustness, and an outstanding F1-score consistently\\nexceeding 0.967. These findings collectively establish Cleansed iHHO-SMOTe as a\\nformidable contender in addressing imbalanced datasets, focusing on noise\\nreduction and outlier handling for improved classification models.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T11:17:53Z\"}"}
