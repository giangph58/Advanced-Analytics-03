The main theorem proves an exact recursive-type\\nequation that expresses the covariation measures of the SHE in terms of the\\nsolutions via an integro-multiplication operator. As an application, the\\nquadratic variations of the martingale parts in the mild form are proven\\nexplicitly expressible in the solutions of the SHE and the two-dimensional\\ntwo-body delta-Bose gas semigroups. The proofs are based on the standard\\napproximations of the two-dimensional SHE at criticality, and now we analyze\\nasymptotic expansions of the covariation measures of the approximate solutions\\nin the limit. Also, new bounds for certain mixed moments of the fourth order of\\nthe approximate solutions are among the main tools for a priori estimates.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T16:50:25Z\"}"}
