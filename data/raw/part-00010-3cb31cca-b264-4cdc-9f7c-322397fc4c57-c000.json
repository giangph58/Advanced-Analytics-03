The 4D-STEM technique allows the acquisition of\\ndiffraction patterns at each electron probe position in a scanning transmission\\nelectron microscope map. This suite includes 4D-STEM acquisition, ptychography,\\nEELS/EDS spectrum imaging, tomography and basic virtual visualization and\\nalignment methods on 4D data including incoherent differential phase contrast\\nanalysis. By integrating electron tomography with 4D-STEM and EELS SI, St4DeM\\nenables the acquisition and analysis of 7-dimensional data.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T13:00:01Z\"}"}
