These nodes exhibit interdependent relationships, forming a graph\\nstructure. While existing prediction methods often assume a fixed graph\\nstructure, many real-world scenarios involve dynamic graph structures.\\nMoreover, interactions among time series observed at different time scales vary\\nsignificantly. To enhance prediction accuracy by capturing precise temporal and\\nspatial features, this paper introduces the Temporal Attention Evolutional\\nGraph Convolutional Network (TAEGCN). This novel method not only integrates\\ncausal temporal convolution and a multi-head self-attention mechanism to learn\\ntemporal features of nodes, but also construct the dynamic graph structure\\nbased on these temporal features to keep the consistency of the changing in\\nspatial feature with temporal series. TAEGCN adeptly captures temporal causal\\nrelationships and hidden spatial dependencies within the data. Furthermore,\\nTAEGCN incorporates a unified neural network that seamlessly integrates these\\ncomponents to generate final predictions. Experimental results conducted on two\\npublic transportation network datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY, demonstrate the\\nsuperior performance of the proposed model.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T04:50:00Z\"}"}
