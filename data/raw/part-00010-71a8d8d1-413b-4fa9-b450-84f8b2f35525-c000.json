In this work, we\\npropose a global Fr\\\\'echet regression estimation method that incorporates\\nlow-rank regularization. Focusing on distribution function responses, we\\ndemonstrate that leveraging the low-rank structure of the model parameters\\nenhances both the efficiency and accuracy of model fitting. Through theoretical\\nanalysis of the large-sample properties, we show that the proposed method\\nenables more robust modeling and estimation than standard dimension reduction\\ntechniques. To support our findings, we also present numerical experiments that\\nevaluate the finite-sample performance.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T03:49:11Z\"}"}
