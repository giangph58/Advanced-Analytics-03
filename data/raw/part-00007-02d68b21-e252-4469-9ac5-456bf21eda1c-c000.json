The flux jump and quench diagram in the Ia-T plane are\\nobtained.It indicates that the ramped-down temperature can completely suppress\\nflux jumps without compromising Jc at high magnetic fields.Importantly, this\\nmethod does not require modifications to the superconducting microstructures or\\nfabrication process, offering a practical and broadly applicable solution.The\\nfindings offer a robust method to stabilize diverse superconducting magnet\\nsystems (including 2nd-gen coated tape HTS magnets), and propose a\\ngeneralizable strategy for controlling instability in nonlinear non-equilibrium\\nphysical systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T06:19:21Z\"}"}
