Once a Groebner basis is certified for the defining ideal I\\nof the quaternionic polynomial algebra, the normal form of a quaternionic\\npolynomial can be computed by routine top reduction with respect to the\\nGroebner basis. In the literature, a Groebner basis under the\\nconjugate-alternating order of quaternionic variables was conjectured for I in\\n2013, but no readable and convincing proof was found.\\n  In this paper, we present the first readable certification of the conjectured\\nGroebner basis. The certification is based on several novel techniques for\\nreduction in free associative algebras, which enables to not only make\\nreduction to S-polynomials more efficiently, but also reduce the number of\\nS-polynomials needed for the certification.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SC\", \"categories\": \"cs.SC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T09:41:01Z\"}"}
