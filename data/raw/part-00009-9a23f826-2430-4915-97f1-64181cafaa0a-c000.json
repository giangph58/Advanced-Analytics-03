Defects in lattice systems may\\ntrap electronic defect states, to which an electron can be excited to form\\ndefect-bound excitons. Here, we examine the effect of band topology on excitons\\nin systems with a single-site defect. We show that in the topological phase,\\nwhen robust, in-gap, ring-shaped electronic states appear around defects,\\nexcitons inherit the properties of these ring states: The excitons' binding\\nenergies are lowered as a result of the wide spatial profile of the defect\\nstate, and their wave functions have complex shapes and order due to the mixed\\norbital character of the topological bands. Our study advances the\\nunderstanding of the role of topology in modifying and controlling defect-bound\\nexcitons in quantum materials.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T09:12:20Z\"}"}
