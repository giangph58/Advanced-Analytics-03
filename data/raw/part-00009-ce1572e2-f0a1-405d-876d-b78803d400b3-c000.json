{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03456v1\", \"title\": \"Narrowline cooling of dysprosium atoms in an optical tweezer array\", \"summary\": \"We perform narrowline cooling of single dysprosium atoms trapped in a 1D\\noptical tweezers array, employing the narrow single-photon transition at 741\\nnm. At the trapping wavelength of 532 nm, the excited state is less trapped\\nthan the ground state. To obtain efficient cooling performances, we chirp the\\nfrequency of the cooling beam to subsequently address the red sidebands of\\ndifferent motional states. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the cooling\\nprotocol through Raman thermometry, which we characterize for our experimental\\nconditions. We obtain an array of 75 atoms close to the motional ground state\\nin the radial direction of the tweezers. Our results demonstrate the\\npossibility to manipulate the motional degree of freedom of dysprosium in\\noptical tweezers arrays, a key ingredient to exploit the potential of\\nlanthanide-based tweezers platforms for quantum science.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph,cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T11:55:41Z\"}"}
