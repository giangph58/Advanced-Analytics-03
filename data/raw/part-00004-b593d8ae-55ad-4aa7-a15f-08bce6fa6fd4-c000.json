To\\nbridge the digital divide, this paper investigates the potential of leveraging\\nmultiple high-altitude platforms (HAPs) for energy-efficient content delivery\\nin wide rural regions. Each caching-enabled HAP is equipped with both\\nFree-Space Optical (FSO) transceivers for backhaul links and Radio Frequency\\n(RF) antenna arrays for access links. To further enhance network efficiency, we\\nconsider a network coding-based multicasting scheme, where different types of\\ncontent are treated as distinct multicast sessions. With the objective of\\nminimizing long-term power cost, we propose a hierarchical framework that\\nintegrates deep reinforcement learn-ing (DRL) and convex optimization to\\njointly optimize dynamic caching strategies and resource allocation across the\\nnetwork. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces\\npower cost compared to several baseline approaches, providing a practical\\nsolution for improving rural connectivity.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY,H.4.0\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:56:20Z\"}"}
