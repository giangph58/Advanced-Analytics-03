Our formulation leverages\\na complex scalar potential along with an appropriately constructed Lagrangian\\nenergy density. Importantly, we show that polarization inhomogeneities can be\\nincluded by simple addition of a spatially dependent polarization angle to the\\ncomplex potential phase. Thus, phase and polarization are seen to be equivalent\\nfrom an energy perspective. As part of our development, we also show how the\\ncomplex scalar potential arises naturally when considering polarization angle\\nas a field symmetry during construction of the Lagrangian. We further show that\\nthe definition of linear momentum density in terms of the complex potential\\nholds a distinct advantage over the conventional definition for inhomogeneously\\npolarized beams.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T11:50:05Z\"}"}
