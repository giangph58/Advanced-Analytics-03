{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04982v1\", \"title\": \"A Vehicle System for Navigating Among Vulnerable Road Users Including\\n  Remote Operation\", \"summary\": \"We present a vehicle system capable of navigating safely and efficiently\\naround Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs), such as pedestrians and cyclists. The\\nsystem comprises key modules for environment perception, localization and\\nmapping, motion planning, and control, integrated into a prototype vehicle. A\\nkey innovation is a motion planner based on Topology-driven Model Predictive\\nControl (T-MPC). The guidance layer generates multiple trajectories in\\nparallel, each representing a distinct strategy for obstacle avoidance or\\nnon-passing. The underlying trajectory optimization constrains the joint\\nprobability of collision with VRUs under generic uncertainties. To address\\nextraordinary situations (\\\"edge cases\\\") that go beyond the autonomous\\ncapabilities - such as construction zones or encounters with emergency\\nresponders - the system includes an option for remote human operation,\\nsupported by visual and haptic guidance. In simulation, our motion planner\\noutperforms three baseline approaches in terms of safety and efficiency. We\\nalso demonstrate the full system in prototype vehicle tests on a closed track,\\nboth in autonomous and remotely operated modes.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T06:39:47Z\"}"}
