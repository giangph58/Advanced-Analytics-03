{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21452v1\", \"title\": \"1-2 Conjectures for Graphs with Low Degeneracy Properties\", \"summary\": \"In a recent work, Keusch proved the so-called 1-2-3 Conjecture, raised by\\nKaro\\\\'nski, {\\\\L}uczak, and Thomason in 2004: for every connected graph\\ndifferent from $K_2$, we can assign labels~$1,2,3$ to the edges so that no two\\nadjacent vertices are incident to the same sum of labels. Despite this\\nsignificant result, several problems close to the 1-2-3 Conjecture in spirit\\nremain widely open. In this work, we focus on the so-called 1-2 Conjecture,\\nraised by Przyby{\\\\l}o and Wo\\\\'zniak in 2010, which is a counterpart of the\\n1-2-3 Conjecture where labels~$1,2$ only can be assigned, and both vertices and\\nedges are labelled. We consider both the 1-2 Conjecture in its original form,\\nwhere adjacent vertices must be distinguished w.r.t.~their sums of incident\\nlabels, and variants for products and multisets. We prove some of these\\nconjectures for graphs with bounded maximum degree (at most~$6$) and bounded\\nmaximum average degree (at most~$3$), going beyond earlier results of the same\\nsort.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T09:20:47Z\"}"}
