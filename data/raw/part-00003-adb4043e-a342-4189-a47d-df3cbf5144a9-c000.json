{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07670v1\", \"title\": \"LAPIS: A novel dataset for personalized image aesthetic assessment\", \"summary\": \"We present the Leuven Art Personalized Image Set (LAPIS), a novel dataset for\\npersonalized image aesthetic assessment (PIAA). It is the first dataset with\\nimages of artworks that is suitable for PIAA. LAPIS consists of 11,723 images\\nand was meticulously curated in collaboration with art historians. Each image\\nhas an aesthetics score and a set of image attributes known to relate to\\naesthetic appreciation. Besides rich image attributes, LAPIS offers rich\\npersonal attributes of each annotator. We implemented two existing\\nstate-of-the-art PIAA models and assessed their performance on LAPIS. We assess\\nthe contribution of personal attributes and image attributes through ablation\\nstudies and find that performance deteriorates when certain personal and image\\nattributes are removed. An analysis of failure cases reveals that both existing\\nmodels make similar incorrect predictions, highlighting the need for\\nimprovements in artistic image aesthetic assessment.
