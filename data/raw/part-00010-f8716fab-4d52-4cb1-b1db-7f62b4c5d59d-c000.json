This\\nstudy investigates how hierarchy affects structural balance as temperature\\nvariations, which measure an individual's average irrationality in society. To\\naddress this question, we develop a two-layer balance model, the\\n\\\\enquote{leader layer}, which maintains structural balance exclusively through\\nintra-layer interactions. Conversely, the \\\\enquote{follower layer} maintains\\nstructural equilibrium through both inter- and intra-layer interactions. The\\nHamiltonian of the leading layer is independent, while the follower layer\\ndepends on its parameters as well as those of the leading layer. Analytical\\nresults from the mean-field approximation and exact Monte Carlo simulations\\nshow that instability arises in the equilibrium states of the follower layer\\nwhen the temperature is below the critical threshold ($T<T_c$), which is\\ndifferent from the structural Heider equilibrium. Furthermore, our findings\\nindicate that the critical temperature is elevated in the follower layer.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T16:16:58Z\"}"}
