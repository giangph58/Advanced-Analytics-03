The conversion probability\\nbetween GWs and EMWs can be enhanced by inhomogeneities in the electron density\\nand magnetic field within the magnetized plasma of both the Milky Way (MW) and\\nthe intergalactic medium (IGM) in the expanding universe. Polarized GWs can\\ninduce polarized EMWs, and the polarization properties of these EMWs can be\\naltered by Faraday rotation as they propagate through magnetized plasma.\\nAdditionally, the polarization intensity of the EMWs may be weakened due to\\ndepolarization effects. In this study, we calculate the enhanced GW-EMW\\nconversion in inhomogeneous magnetized plasma during the propagation of GWs\\nthrough the universe and our galaxy. We analyze the polarization states of the\\nEMWs generated by polarized GWs and discuss the depolarization effects induced\\nby the medium's irregularities, as well as the differential Faraday rotation\\noccurring in multi-layer polarized radiation. Our work provides alternative\\nmethods for detecting GWs and exploring their polarization states, and\\npotentially constrain the parameters of the possible GW sources, especially the\\nprimordial black hole (PBH), contributing to the advancement of\\nvery-high-frequency GW detection and research.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:30:35Z\"}"}
