{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23930v1\", \"title\": \"Exploring Reliable PPG Authentication on Smartwatches in Daily Scenarios\", \"summary\": \"Photoplethysmography (PPG) Sensors, widely deployed in smartwatches, offer a\\nsimple and non-invasive authentication approach for daily use. However, PPG\\nauthentication faces reliability issues due to motion artifacts from physical\\nactivity and physiological variability over time. To address these challenges,\\nwe propose MTL-RAPID, an efficient and reliable PPG authentication model, that\\nemploys a multitask joint training strategy, simultaneously assessing signal\\nquality and verifying user identity. The joint optimization of these two tasks\\nin MTL-RAPID results in a structure that outperforms models trained on\\nindividual tasks separately, achieving stronger performance with fewer\\nparameters. In our comprehensive user studies regarding motion artifacts (N =\\n30), time variations (N = 32), and user preferences (N = 16), MTL-RAPID\\nachieves a best AUC of 99.2\\\\% and an EER of 3.5\\\\%, outperforming existing\\nbaselines. We opensource our PPG authentication dataset along with the\\nMTL-RAPID model to facilitate future research on GitHub.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T10:25:48Z\"}"}
