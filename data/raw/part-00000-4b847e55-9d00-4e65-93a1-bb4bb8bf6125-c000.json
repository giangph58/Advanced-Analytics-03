{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17267v1\", \"title\": \"MV-Crafter: An Intelligent System for Music-guided Video Generation\", \"summary\": \"Music videos, as a prevalent form of multimedia entertainment, deliver\\nengaging audio-visual experiences to audiences and have gained immense\\npopularity among singers and fans. Creators can express their interpretations\\nof music naturally through visual elements. However, the creation process of\\nmusic video demands proficiency in script design, video shooting, and\\nmusic-video synchronization, posing significant challenges for\\nnon-professionals. Previous work has designed automated music video generation\\nframeworks. However, they suffer from complexity in input and poor output\\nquality. In response, we present MV-Crafter, a system capable of producing\\nhigh-quality music videos with synchronized music-video rhythm and style. Our\\napproach involves three technical modules that simulate the human creation\\nprocess: the script generation module, video generation module, and music-video\\nsynchronization module. MV-Crafter leverages a large language model to generate\\nscripts considering the musical semantics. To address the challenge of\\nsynchronizing short video clips with music of varying lengths, we propose a\\ndynamic beat matching algorithm and visual envelope-induced warping method to\\nensure precise, monotonic music-video synchronization. Besides, we design a\\nuser-friendly interface to simplify the creation process with intuitive editing\\nfeatures. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that MV-Crafter provides an\\neffective solution for improving the quality of generated music videos.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.MM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T05:52:07Z\"}"}
