We show that, in a suitable reference frame, the influence of any\\ngravitational field can be decomposed into transverse, longitudinal, and\\nNewtonian components, which are directly related to the Cotton scalars of the\\nNewman-Penrose-type. In particular, we prove that Cotton type N spacetimes\\nexhibit a purely transverse gravitational effect on test particles, and can\\nthus be reasonably interpreted as specific gravitational waves with a single\\npolarization mode in TMG. The influence of the cosmological constant manifests\\nitself as an isotropic effect. We also discuss the physical interpretation of\\nspacetimes of specific algebraic types, as well as the influence of various\\nmatter fields, namely pure radiation, perfect fluid, and electromagnetic field.\\nAs an example, we provide an explicit analysis of TN-waves and pp-waves in\\nthree-dimensional TMG.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T17:08:37Z\"}"}
