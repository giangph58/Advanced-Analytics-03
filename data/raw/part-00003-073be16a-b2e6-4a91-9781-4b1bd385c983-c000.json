{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04460v1\", \"title\": \"Learning Real Facial Concepts for Independent Deepfake Detection\", \"summary\": \"Deepfake detection models often struggle with generalization to unseen\\ndatasets, manifesting as misclassifying real instances as fake in target\\ndomains. This is primarily due to an overreliance on forgery artifacts and a\\nlimited understanding of real faces. To address this challenge, we propose a\\nnovel approach RealID to enhance generalization by learning a comprehensive\\nconcept of real faces while assessing the probabilities of belonging to the\\nreal and fake classes independently. RealID comprises two key modules: the Real\\nConcept Capture Module (RealC2) and the Independent Dual-Decision Classifier\\n(IDC). With the assistance of a MultiReal Memory, RealC2 maintains various\\nprototypes for real faces, allowing the model to capture a comprehensive\\nconcept of real class. Meanwhile, IDC redefines the classification strategy by\\nmaking independent decisions based on the concept of the real class and the\\npresence of forgery artifacts. Through the combined effect of the above\\nmodules, the influence of forgery-irrelevant patterns is alleviated, and\\nextensive experiments on five widely used datasets demonstrate that RealID\\nsignificantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 1.74%\\nimprovement in average accuracy.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:31:04Z\"}"}
