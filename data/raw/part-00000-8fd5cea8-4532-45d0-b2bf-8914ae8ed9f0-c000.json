The outputs of such systems vary not only with physical parameters but\\nalso with external time-varying input signals. Accurately catching the dynamics\\nof such systems is challenging. We have adapted and extended an existing\\ntransformer model for single output prediction to a multiple-output transformer\\nthat is able to predict multiple output responses of these systems. The\\nmultiple-output transformer generalizes the interpretability of the original\\ntransformer. The generalized interpretable attention weight matrix explores not\\nonly the temporal correlations in the sequence, but also the interactions\\nbetween the multiple outputs, providing explanation for the spatial correlation\\nin the output domain. This multiple-output transformer accurately predicts the\\nsequence of multiple outputs, regardless of the nonlinearity of the system and\\nthe dimensionality of the parameter space.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.NA,math.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T11:55:42Z\"}"}
