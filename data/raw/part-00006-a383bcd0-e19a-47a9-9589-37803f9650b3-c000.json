In semiconductors, it drives the Rashba\\nspin splitting and spin momentum locking, while in magnetic insulators based on\\ntransition metals, it induces anisotropic spin exchange interactions, like\\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction which drive chiral magnetism and\\nskyrmion formation. Here, we establish a direct connection between SOC and spin\\nexchange interactions by deriving an effective spin model from the SOC Hubbard\\nmodel at half-filling. Using a strong-coupling expansion up to fourth order, we\\nidentify Heisenberg, Ising-like, and ring exchange interactions, as well as a\\nvariety of four-body terms for realistic Hubbard parameters. These parameters\\nconstrain the relative strengths of spin interactions, providing a natural\\ninterpolation between metallic and insulating phases that host complex magnetic\\ntextures.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T15:11:25Z\"}"}
