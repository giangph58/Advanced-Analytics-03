Morphological comparison of molecular and thermal dust\\n  emission using the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) method\", \"summary\": \"The study of molecular line emission is crucial to unveil the kinematics and\\nthe physical conditions of gas in star-forming regions. Our aim is to quantify\\nthe reliability of using individual molecular transitions to derive physical\\nproperties of the bulk of the H2 gas, looking at morphological correlations in\\ntheir overall integrated molecular line emission with the cold dust. For this\\nstudy we selected transitions of H2CO, CH$_3$OH, DCN, HC$_3$N, CH$_3$CN,\\nCH$_3$OCHO, SO, and SiO and compared them with the 1.38 mm dust continuum\\nemission at different spatial scales in the ALMAGAL sample, that observed a\\ntotal of 1013 targets covering all evolutionary stages of the high-mass\\nstar-formation process and different conditions of clump fragmentation. We used\\nthe method of the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) implemented in the tool\\nastroHOG to compare the morphology of integrated line emission with maps of the\\n1.38 mm dust continuum emission. Moreover, we calculated the Spearman's\\ncorrelation coefficient, and compared it with our astroHOG results. Only\\nH$_2$CO, CH$_3$OH, and SO show emission on spatial scales comparable with the\\ndiffuse continuum emission. However, from the HOG method, the median\\ncorrelation of the emission of each of these species with the continuum is only\\n$\\\\sim$24-29%. In comparison with the dense fragments these molecular species\\nstill have low values of correlation. On the other hand DCN, HC$_3$N, CH$_3$CN,\\nand CH$_3$OCHO show a good correlation with the dense dust fragments, above\\n60%. The worst correlation is seen with SiO, both with the extended continuum\\nemission and with compact sources. From the comparison of the results of the\\nHOG method and the Spearman's correlation coefficient, the HOG method gives\\nmuch more reliable results than the intensity-based coefficient in estimating\\nthe level of similarity of the emission morphology.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T14:17:28Z\"}"}
