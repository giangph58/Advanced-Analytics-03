By modeling interior point distributions in a convex domain as\\nrepelling charges balanced against a continuous boundary charge, we show that\\nthe resulting equilibrium configurations converge to CVT structures. We prove\\nthis by showing that CVTs minimize both the classical centroidal energy and the\\nelectrostatic potential, establishing a connection between geometric\\nquantization and potential theory. Finally, we introduce a thermodynamic\\nannealing scheme for global CVT optimization, rooted in Boltzmann statistics\\nand random walk dynamics. By introducing a scheme for varying time steps\\n(faster or slower cooling) we show that the set of minima of the centroid\\nenergy functional (and therefore the electrostatic potential) can be recovered.\\nBy recovering a set of generator locations corresponding to each minimum we can\\ncreate a lattice continuation that allows for a customizable framework for\\nindividual minimum seeking.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA,math-ph,math.MG,math.MP,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:36:15Z\"}"}
