They have been observed for rod-like molecules with a strong\\nlongitudinal dipole moment, featuring an (S)-2-methylbutyl end group having\\nonly weak twisting power, and emerge below the antiferroelectric SmAAF phase,\\nwhere the lamellar structure is already well established. It is suggested that\\nthe structure is governed by electrostatic interactions amplified by weak\\nchiral forces, in striking contrast to the mechanism of TGB phase formation\\nfound in non-polar materials. The TGB phases exhibit light selective reflection\\nin the visible range, while the value of electric polarization confirms an\\nalmost perfectly ordered dipole alignment.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T08:36:48Z\"}"}
