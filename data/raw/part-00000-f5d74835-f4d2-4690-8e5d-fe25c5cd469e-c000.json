Bayesian analysis of the statistical\\n  information of null results in future exoplanet habitability and biosignature\\n  surveys\", \"summary\": \"Future telescopes will survey temperate, terrestrial exoplanets to estimate\\nthe frequency of habitable ($\\\\eta_{\\\\text{Hab}}$) or inhabited\\n($\\\\eta_{\\\\text{Life}}$) planets. This study aims to determine the minimum number\\nof planets ($N$) required to draw statistically significant conclusions,\\nparticularly in the case of a null result (i.e., no detections). Using a\\nBayesian framework, we analyzed surveys of up to $N=100$ planets to infer the\\nfrequency of a binary observable feature ($\\\\eta_{\\\\text{obs}}$) after null\\nresults. Posterior best fits and upper limits were derived for various survey\\nsizes and compared with predicted yields from missions like the Large\\nInterferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE) and the Habitable Worlds Observatory\\n(HWO). Our findings indicate that $N=20-50$ ``perfect'' observations (100\\\\%\\nconfidence in detecting or excluding the feature) yield conclusions relatively\\nindependent of priors. To achieve 99.9\\\\% upper limits of $\\\\eta_{\\\\text{obs}}\\n\\\\leq 0.2/0.1$, approximately $N \\\\simeq 40/80$ observations are needed. For\\n``imperfect'' observations, uncertainties in interpretation and sample biases\\nbecome limiting factors. We show that LIFE and HWO aim for sufficiently large\\nsurvey sizes to provide statistically meaningful estimates of habitable\\nenvironments and life prevalence under these assumptions. However, robust\\nconclusions require careful sample selection and high-confidence detection or\\nexclusion of features in each observation.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T11:02:19Z\"}"}
