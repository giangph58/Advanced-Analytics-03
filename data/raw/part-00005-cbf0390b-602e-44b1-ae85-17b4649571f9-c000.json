{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05241v1\", \"title\": \"Insights into Neutron Star Matter: EoS Models and Observations\", \"summary\": \"The equation of state (EoS) for neutron stars is a crucial topic in\\nastrophysics, nuclear physics, and quantum chromodynamics (QCD), influencing\\ntheir structure, stability, and observable properties. This review classifies\\nEoS models into hadronic matter, hybrid, and quark matter models, analyzing\\ntheir assumptions, predictions, and constraints. While hadronic models\\ncharacterize nucleonic matter, potentially including contributions from\\nhyperons or mesons, hybrid models introduce phase transitions to quark matter,\\nand quark models hypothesize the presence of deconfined quark matter cores or\\nentirely quark-composed stars. By synthesizing results from recent theoretical\\nand observational studies, this review aims to offer a comprehensive\\nunderstanding of the methodologies used in constructing neutron star EoS, their\\nimplications, and future directions.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,astro-ph.HE,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:36:28Z\"}"}
