{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06881v1\", \"title\": \"Compound and Parallel Modes of Tropical Convolutional Neural Networks\", \"summary\": \"Convolutional neural networks have become increasingly deep and complex,\\nleading to higher computational costs. While tropical convolutional neural\\nnetworks (TCNNs) reduce multiplications, they underperform compared to standard\\nCNNs. To address this, we propose two new variants - compound TCNN (cTCNN) and\\nparallel TCNN (pTCNN)-that use combinations of tropical min-plus and max-plus\\nkernels to replace traditional convolution kernels. This reduces\\nmultiplications and balances efficiency with performance. Experiments on\\nvarious datasets show that cTCNN and pTCNN match or exceed the performance of\\nother CNN methods. Combining these with conventional CNNs in deeper\\narchitectures also improves performance. We are further exploring simplified\\nTCNN architectures that reduce parameters and multiplications with minimal\\naccuracy loss, aiming for efficient and effective models.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI,I.2.6\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:36:11Z\"}"}
