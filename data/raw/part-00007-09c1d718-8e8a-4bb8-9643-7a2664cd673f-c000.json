{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07083v1\", \"title\": \"GenDoP: Auto-regressive Camera Trajectory Generation as a Director of\\n  Photography\", \"summary\": \"Camera trajectory design plays a crucial role in video production, serving as\\na fundamental tool for conveying directorial intent and enhancing visual\\nstorytelling. In cinematography, Directors of Photography meticulously craft\\ncamera movements to achieve expressive and intentional framing. However,\\nexisting methods for camera trajectory generation remain limited: Traditional\\napproaches rely on geometric optimization or handcrafted procedural systems,\\nwhile recent learning-based methods often inherit structural biases or lack\\ntextual alignment, constraining creative synthesis. In this work, we introduce\\nan auto-regressive model inspired by the expertise of Directors of Photography\\nto generate artistic and expressive camera trajectories. We first introduce\\nDataDoP, a large-scale multi-modal dataset containing 29K real-world shots with\\nfree-moving camera trajectories, depth maps, and detailed captions in specific\\nmovements, interaction with the scene, and directorial intent. Thanks to the\\ncomprehensive and diverse database, we further train an auto-regressive,\\ndecoder-only Transformer for high-quality, context-aware camera movement\\ngeneration based on text guidance and RGBD inputs, named GenDoP. Extensive\\nexperiments demonstrate that compared to existing methods, GenDoP offers better\\ncontrollability, finer-grained trajectory adjustments, and higher motion\\nstability. We believe our approach establishes a new standard for\\nlearning-based cinematography, paving the way for future advancements in camera\\ncontrol and filmmaking.
