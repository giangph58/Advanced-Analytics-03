Among recent methods,\\nGRPO stands out for its empirical success in training models such as\\nDeepSeek-R1, yet the sources of its effectiveness remain poorly understood. In\\nthis work, we revisit GRPO from a reinforce-like algorithm perspective and\\nanalyze its core components. Surprisingly, we find that a simple rejection\\nsampling baseline, RAFT, which trains only on positively rewarded samples,\\nyields competitive performance than GRPO and PPO. Our ablation studies reveal\\nthat GRPO's main advantage arises from discarding prompts with entirely\\nincorrect responses, rather than from its reward normalization. Motivated by\\nthis insight, we propose Reinforce-Rej, a minimal extension of policy gradient\\nthat filters both entirely incorrect and entirely correct samples.\\nReinforce-Rej improves KL efficiency and stability, serving as a lightweight\\nyet effective alternative to more complex RL algorithms. We advocate RAFT as a\\nrobust and interpretable baseline, and suggest that future advances should\\nfocus on more principled designs for incorporating negative samples, rather\\nthan relying on them indiscriminately. Our findings provide guidance for future\\nwork in reward-based LLM post-training.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.CL,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:15:02Z\"}"}
