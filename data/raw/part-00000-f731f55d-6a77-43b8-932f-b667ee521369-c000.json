{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15886v1\", \"title\": \"Beyond Attention: Investigating the Threshold Where Objective Robot\\n  Exclusion Becomes Subjective\", \"summary\": \"As robots become increasingly involved in decision-making processes (e.g.,\\npersonnel selection), concerns about fairness and social inclusion arise. This\\nstudy examines social exclusion in robot-led group interviews by robot Ameca,\\nexploring the relationship between objective exclusion (robot's attention\\nallocation), subjective exclusion (perceived exclusion), mood change, and need\\nfulfillment. In a controlled lab study (N = 35), higher objective exclusion\\nsignificantly predicted subjective exclusion. In turn, subjective exclusion\\nnegatively impacted mood and need fulfillment but only mediated the\\nrelationship between objective exclusion and need fulfillment. A piecewise\\nregression analysis identified a critical threshold at which objective\\nexclusion begins to be perceived as subjective exclusion. Additionally, the\\nstanding position was the primary predictor of exclusion, whereas demographic\\nfactors (e.g., gender, height) had no significant effect. These findings\\nunderscore the need to consider both objective and subjective exclusion in\\nhuman-robot interactions and have implications for fairness in robot-assisted\\nhiring processes.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T13:31:14Z\"}"}
