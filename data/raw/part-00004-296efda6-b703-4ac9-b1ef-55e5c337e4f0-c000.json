{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05375v1\", \"title\": \"Threshold Modulation for Online Test-Time Adaptation of Spiking Neural\\n  Networks\", \"summary\": \"Recently, spiking neural networks (SNNs), deployed on neuromorphic chips,\\nprovide highly efficient solutions on edge devices in different scenarios.\\nHowever, their ability to adapt to distribution shifts after deployment has\\nbecome a crucial challenge. Online test-time adaptation (OTTA) offers a\\npromising solution by enabling models to dynamically adjust to new data\\ndistributions without requiring source data or labeled target samples.\\nNevertheless, existing OTTA methods are largely designed for traditional\\nartificial neural networks and are not well-suited for SNNs. To address this\\ngap, we propose a low-power, neuromorphic chip-friendly online test-time\\nadaptation framework, aiming to enhance model generalization under distribution\\nshifts. The proposed approach is called Threshold Modulation (TM), which\\ndynamically adjusts the firing threshold through neuronal dynamics-inspired\\nnormalization, being more compatible with neuromorphic hardware. Experimental\\nresults on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in\\nimproving the robustness of SNNs against distribution shifts while maintaining\\nlow computational cost. The proposed method offers a practical solution for\\nonline test-time adaptation of SNNs, providing inspiration for the design of\\nfuture neuromorphic chips.
