The aim of this paper\\nis to solve stochastic optimization problems with unknown uncertainty when we\\nonly have access to a finite set of samples from it. Exploiting strong duality\\nof DRO problems over structured ambiguity sets, we derive tractable\\nreformulations for certain classes of DRO and uncertainty quantification\\nproblems. We also derive tractable reformulations for distributionally robust\\nchance-constrained problems. As the complexity of the reformulations may grow\\nexponentially with the number of independent uncertainty components, we employ\\nclustering strategies to obtain informative estimators, which yield problems of\\nmanageable complexity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical\\nresults in a numerical simulation example.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T15:19:56Z\"}"}
