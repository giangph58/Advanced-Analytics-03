Accurate prediction of free energy changes (G) of these\\nintermediates and products is essential for evaluating catalytic performance.\\nWe combined density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) to screen\\n25 single-atom catalysts (SACs) on defective r-GeSe monolayers for CO2\\nreduction to methanol, methane, and formic acid. Among nine ML models evaluated\\nwith 14 intrinsic and DFT-based features, the XGBoost performed best (R2 = 0.92\\nand MAE = 0.24 eV), aligning closely with DFT calculations and identifying Ni,\\nRu, and Rh@GeSe as prospective catalysts. Feature importance analysis in free\\nenergy and product predictions highlighted the significance of CO2 activation\\nwith O-C-O and IPC-O1 as the key attributes. Furthermore, by incorporating\\nnon-DFT-based features, rapid predictions became possible, and the XGBoost\\nmodel retained its predictive performance with R2 = 0.89 and MAE = 0.29 eV.\\nThis accuracy was further validated using Ir@GeSe. Our work highlights\\neffective SACs for CO2RR, and provides valuable insights for efficient catalyst\\ndesign.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T08:52:18Z\"}"}
