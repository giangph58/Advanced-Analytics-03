{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05297v1\", \"title\": \"Repair Crew Routing for Infrastructure Network Restoration under\\n  Incomplete Information\", \"summary\": \"This paper considers a disrupted infrastructure network where the repair crew\\nknows the locations of service outages but not the locations of actual faults.\\nOur goal is to determine a route for a single crew to visit and repair the\\ndisruptions to restore service with minimum negative impact. We call this\\nproblem the Traveling Repairman Network Restoration Problem (TRNRP). This\\nproblem presents strong computational challenges due to the combinatorial\\nnature of the decisions, inter-dependencies within the underlying\\ninfrastructure network, and incomplete information. Considering the dynamic\\nnature of the decisions as a result of dynamic information revelation on the\\nstatus of the nodes, we model this problem as a finite-horizon Markov decision\\nprocess. Our solution approach uses value approximation based on reinforcement\\nlearning, which is strengthened by structural results that identify a set of\\nsuboptimal moves. In addition, we propose state aggregation methods to reduce\\nthe size of the state space. We perform extensive computational studies to\\ncharacterize the performance of our solution methods under different parameter\\nsettings and to compare them with benchmark solution approaches.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:39:45Z\"}"}
