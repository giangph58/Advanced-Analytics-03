By\\ngradually considering stricter conditions, we restrict the discussion to a more\\nand more narrow class of Hermitian spaces. We are eventually interested in\\nquadratic spaces over countable subfields of $\\\\mathbb R$.\\n  A line of an orthoset is the orthoclosure of two distinct element. For an\\northoset to be line-symmetric means roughly that its automorphism group acts\\ntransitively both on the collection of all lines as well as on each single\\nline. Line-symmetric orthosets turn out to be in correspondence with transitive\\nHermitian spaces. Furthermore, quadratic orthosets are defined similarly, but\\nare required to possess, for each line $\\\\ell$, a group of automorphisms acting\\non $\\\\ell$ transitively and commutatively. We show the correspondence of\\nquadratic orthosets with transitive quadratic spaces over ordered fields. We\\nfinally specify those quadratic orthosets that are, in a natural sense,\\nminimal: for a finite $n \\\\geq 4$, the orthoset $(P(R^n),\\\\perp)$, where $R$ is\\nthe Hilbert field, has the property of being embeddable into any other\\nquadratic orthoset of rank $n$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RA\", \"categories\": \"math.RA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T08:17:41Z\"}"}
