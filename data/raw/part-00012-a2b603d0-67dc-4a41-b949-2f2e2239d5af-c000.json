{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10096v1\", \"title\": \"Performances in solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation with the Yambo code\", \"summary\": \"In this work, we analyze the performances of two different strategies in\\nsolving the structured eigenvalue problem deriving from the Bethe-Salpeter\\nequation (BSE) in condensed matter physics. The first strategy employs direct\\ndiagonalization, while the second is based on an iterative solver. The BSE\\nmatrix is constructed with the Yambo code, and the two strategies are\\nimplemented by interfacing Yambo with the ScaLAPACK and ELPA libraries for\\ndirect diagonalization, and with the SLEPc library for the iterative approach.\\nWe consider both the hermitian (Tamm-Dancoff approximation) and\\npseudo-hermitian forms, addressing dense matrices of three different sizes. A\\ndescription of the implementation is also provided, with details for the\\npseudo-hermitian case. Timing and memory utilization are analyzed on both CPU\\nand GPU clusters. The CPU simulations are performed on a local cluster in Rome,\\nwhile the GPU simulations are performed on the Leonardo HPC cluster of CINECA.\\nOur results demonstrate that it is now feasible to handle dense BSE matrices of\\nthe order 10$^5$.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cs.DC,81-04,A.0\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T11:02:36Z\"}"}
