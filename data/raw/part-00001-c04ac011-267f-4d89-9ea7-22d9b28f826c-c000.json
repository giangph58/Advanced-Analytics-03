{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15676v1\", \"title\": \"Trustworthy Decentralized Autonomous Machines: A New Paradigm in\\n  Automation Economy\", \"summary\": \"Decentralized Autonomous Machines (DAMs) represent a transformative paradigm\\nin automation economy, integrating artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain\\ntechnology, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices to create self-governing\\neconomic agents participating in Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks\\n(DePIN). Capable of managing both digital and physical assets and unlike\\ntraditional Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), DAMs extend autonomy\\ninto the physical world, enabling trustless systems for Real and Digital World\\nAssets (RDWAs). In this paper, we explore the technological foundations, and\\nchallenges of DAMs and argue that DAMs are pivotal in transitioning from\\ntrust-based to trustless economic models, offering scalable, transparent, and\\nequitable solutions for asset management. The integration of AI-driven\\ndecision-making, IoT-enabled operational autonomy, and blockchain-based\\ngovernance allows DAMs to decentralize ownership, optimize resource allocation,\\nand democratize access to economic opportunities. Therefore, in this research,\\nwe highlight the potential of DAMs to address inefficiencies in centralized\\nsystems, reduce wealth disparities, and foster a post-labor economy.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MA\", \"categories\": \"cs.MA,cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T07:59:46Z\"}"}
