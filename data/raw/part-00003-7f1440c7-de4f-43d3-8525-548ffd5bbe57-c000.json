{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14860v1\", \"title\": \"Bridge the Gap: From Weak to Full Supervision for Temporal Action\\n  Localization with PseudoFormer\", \"summary\": \"Weakly-supervised Temporal Action Localization (WTAL) has achieved notable\\nsuccess but still suffers from a lack of temporal annotations, leading to a\\nperformance and framework gap compared with fully-supervised methods. While\\nrecent approaches employ pseudo labels for training, three key challenges:\\ngenerating high-quality pseudo labels, making full use of different priors, and\\noptimizing training methods with noisy labels remain unresolved. Due to these\\nperspectives, we propose PseudoFormer, a novel two-branch framework that\\nbridges the gap between weakly and fully-supervised Temporal Action\\nLocalization (TAL). We first introduce RickerFusion, which maps all predicted\\naction proposals to a global shared space to generate pseudo labels with better\\nquality. Subsequently, we leverage both snippet-level and proposal-level labels\\nwith different priors from the weak branch to train the regression-based model\\nin the full branch. Finally, the uncertainty mask and iterative refinement\\nmechanism are applied for training with noisy pseudo labels. PseudoFormer\\nachieves state-of-the-art WTAL results on the two commonly used benchmarks,\\nTHUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3. Besides, extensive ablation studies demonstrate\\nthe contribution of each component of our method.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T05:00:07Z\"}"}
