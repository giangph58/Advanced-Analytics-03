{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17605v1\", \"title\": \"A Constraint Opinion Model\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces a generalised opinion model that extends the standard\\nDeGroot model by representing agents' opinions and influences as soft\\nconstraints rather than single real values. This allows for modelling scenarios\\nbeyond the scope of the DeGroot model, such as agents sharing partial\\ninformation and preferences, engaging in discussions on multiple topics\\nsimultaneously, and representing opinions with different degrees of\\nuncertainty. By considering soft constraints as influences, the proposed model\\ncaptures also situations where agents impose conditions on how others' opinions\\nare integrated during belief revision. Finally, the flexibility offered by soft\\nconstraints allows us to introduce a novel polarisation measure that takes\\nadvantage of this generalised framework.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LO\", \"categories\": \"cs.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:29:25Z\"}"}
