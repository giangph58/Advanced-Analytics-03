{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20856v1\", \"title\": \"Wave Particle Interaction in the Upstream of ICME Shocks\", \"summary\": \"Shocks associated with Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections are known to\\nenergize charged particles and give rise to Solar Energetic Particles. Many of\\nthese energetic particles move ahead of the shock to create a foreshock region.\\nThe foreshock region primarily consists of solar wind plasma, exhibiting\\nturbulent velocity and magnetic fields. Such turbulent behavior results from\\ninherent solar wind turbulence modified by energetic particles. We analyze\\nmagnetic field data from six such ICME shocks observed by the Wind spacecraft.\\nThe analysis of the shock upstream shows that the magnetic power spectral\\ndensity (PSD) maintains a power-law slope of $-5/3$. We also identify clear\\nintermittent peaks in the PSD. After characterizing these peaks, we investigate\\nvarious possibilities for their generation. Our analysis indicates that these\\npeaks in the PSD are due to the resonant interaction of Alfv\\\\'en waves with the\\nbulk solar wind protons and protons with energy up to $10$~keV. However,\\nevidence of Alfv\\\\'en wave interaction with highly energetic protons is not\\nevident in our analysis, and we anticipate that such evidence is obscured by\\nthe prevailing solar wind turbulence in the shock upstream.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T15:31:21Z\"}"}
