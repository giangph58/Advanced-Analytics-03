{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21851v1\", \"title\": \"TRUST: An LLM-Based Dialogue System for Trauma Understanding and\\n  Structured Assessments\", \"summary\": \"Objectives: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely used to\\nassist clinicians and support patients, no existing work has explored dialogue\\nsystems for standard diagnostic interviews and assessments. This study aims to\\nbridge the gap in mental healthcare accessibility by developing an LLM-powered\\ndialogue system that replicates clinician behavior. Materials and Methods: We\\nintroduce TRUST, a framework of cooperative LLM modules capable of conducting\\nformal diagnostic interviews and assessments for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder\\n(PTSD). To guide the generation of appropriate clinical responses, we propose a\\nDialogue Acts schema specifically designed for clinical interviews.\\nAdditionally, we develop a patient simulation approach based on real-life\\ninterview transcripts to replace time-consuming and costly manual testing by\\nclinicians. Results: A comprehensive set of evaluation metrics is designed to\\nassess the dialogue system from both the agent and patient simulation\\nperspectives. Expert evaluations by conversation and clinical specialists show\\nthat TRUST performs comparably to real-life clinical interviews. Discussion:\\nOur system performs at the level of average clinicians, with room for future\\nenhancements in communication styles and response appropriateness. Conclusions:\\nOur TRUST framework shows its potential to facilitate mental healthcare\\navailability.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:58:06Z\"}"}
