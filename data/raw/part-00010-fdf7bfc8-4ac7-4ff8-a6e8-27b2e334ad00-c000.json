{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07638v1\", \"title\": \"Predicting the Lifespan of Industrial Printheads with Survival Analysis\", \"summary\": \"Accurately predicting the lifespan of critical device components is essential\\nfor maintenance planning and production optimization, making it a topic of\\nsignificant interest in both academia and industry. In this work, we\\ninvestigate the use of survival analysis for predicting the lifespan of\\nproduction printheads developed by Canon Production Printing. Specifically, we\\nfocus on the application of five techniques to estimate survival probabilities\\nand failure rates: the Kaplan-Meier estimator, Cox proportional hazard model,\\nWeibull accelerated failure time model, random survival forest, and gradient\\nboosting. The resulting estimates are further refined using isotonic regression\\nand subsequently aggregated to determine the expected number of failures. The\\npredictions are then validated against real-world ground truth data across\\nmultiple time windows to assess model reliability. Our quantitative evaluation\\nusing three performance metrics demonstrates that survival analysis outperforms\\nindustry-standard baseline methods for printhead lifespan prediction.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T10:38:13Z\"}"}
