The two-mode dynamics of the\\ncounter-propagating modes - clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) and their\\nselection, have gained attention in the mid-infrared; however, the underlying\\nswitching mechanism has been largely unexplored. Previously, we experimentally\\ndemonstrated robust and deterministic mode selection in a ring quantum cascade\\nlaser (QCL) with an active outcoupling waveguide. Here, we apply the\\nLang-Kobayashi framework to our system to model the effects of spontaneous\\nemission in the waveguide arms as well as amplified optical feedback from the\\nfacets on the mechanics of mode switching. We find that coherent feedback from\\nfacet reflections agrees upwards of 93\\\\% with the experimental behavior,\\nindicating that amplified feedback is the dominant mechanism driving the mode\\nselection dynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T16:14:45Z\"}"}
