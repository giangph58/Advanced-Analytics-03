This study investigates the generation\\nof parametric sequences for computer-aided design (CAD) models using LLMs. This\\nendeavor represents an initial step towards creating parametric 3D shapes with\\nLLMs, as CAD model parameters directly correlate with shapes in\\nthree-dimensional space. Despite the formidable generative capacities of LLMs,\\nthis task remains challenging, as these models neither encounter parametric\\nsequences during their pretraining phase nor possess direct awareness of 3D\\nstructures. To address this, we present CAD-Llama, a framework designed to\\nenhance pretrained LLMs for generating parametric 3D CAD models. Specifically,\\nwe develop a hierarchical annotation pipeline and a code-like format to\\ntranslate parametric 3D CAD command sequences into Structured Parametric CAD\\nCode (SPCC), incorporating hierarchical semantic descriptions. Furthermore, we\\npropose an adaptive pretraining approach utilizing SPCC, followed by an\\ninstruction tuning process aligned with CAD-specific guidelines. This\\nmethodology aims to equip LLMs with the spatial knowledge inherent in\\nparametric sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework\\nsignificantly outperforms prior autoregressive methods and existing LLM\\nbaselines.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:52:02Z\"}"}
