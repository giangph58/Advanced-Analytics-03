While these approaches can achieve high accuracy, their\\nlack of interpretability limits their applicability in clinical practice. In\\nthis paper, we investigate the use of multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs),\\nspecifically ChatGPT-4o, for automatic pathological speech detection in a\\nfew-shot in-context learning setting. Experimental results show that this\\napproach not only delivers promising performance but also provides explanations\\nfor its decisions, enhancing model interpretability. To further understand its\\neffectiveness, we conduct an ablation study to analyze the impact of different\\nfactors, such as input type and system prompts, on the final results. Our\\nfindings highlight the potential of multimodal LLMs for further exploration and\\nadvancement in automatic pathological speech detection.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.AS\", \"categories\": \"eess.AS,cs.SD\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T09:23:52Z\"}"}
