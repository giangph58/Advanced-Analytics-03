In this study, we report the detection of 12 quasi-periodic\\nsub-structures in a rotating radio transient (RRAT) J1913+1330 using the\\nFive-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST). This is the\\nsecond known RRAT exhibiting quasi-periodic sub-structures. Our result\\nreinforces the observed relationship between quasi-periodicity and rotational\\nperiod. The polarization analysis reveals that 11 of the 12 pulses exhibit high\\nlinear polarization consistent with the quasi-periodic behaviour of the total\\nintensity, while circular polarization with detectable quasi-periodic\\nsub-structures is observed in only three pulses. No correlation is found\\nbetween the sub-structure periods and their widths, peak fluxes, or fluences,\\neven under the extremely variable single-pulse energy and morphology observed\\nin J1913+1330.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:11:49Z\"}"}
