{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17700v1\", \"title\": \"Applied Sheaf Theory For Multi-agent Artificial Intelligence\\n  (Reinforcement Learning) Systems: A Prospectus\", \"summary\": \"This paper provides a pedagogical introduction to classical sheaf theory and\\nsheaf cohomology, followed by a research prospectus exploring potential\\napplications to multi-agent artificial intelligence systems. The first section\\noffers a comprehensive overview of fundamental sheaf-theoretic\\nconcepts-presheaves, sheaves, stalks, and cohomology-aimed at researchers in\\ncomputer science and AI who may not have extensive background in algebraic\\ntopology. The second section presents a detailed research prospectus that\\noutlines a roadmap for developing sheaf-theoretic approaches to model and\\nanalyze complex systems of interacting agents. We propose that sheaf theory's\\ninherent local-to-global perspective may provide valuable mathematical tools\\nfor reasoning about how local agent behaviors collectively determine emergent\\nsystem properties. The third section contains a literature review connecting\\nsheaf theory with existing research in multi-agent systems, reinforcement\\nlearning, and economic modeling. This paper does not present a completed model\\nbut rather lays theoretical groundwork and identifies promising research\\ndirections that could bridge abstract mathematics with practical AI\\napplications, potentially revealing new approaches to coordination and\\nemergence in multi-agent systems.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,math.AT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T16:08:53Z\"}"}
