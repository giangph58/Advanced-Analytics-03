{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00490v1\", \"title\": \"Optimal Interactive Learning on the Job via Facility Location Planning\", \"summary\": \"Collaborative robots must continually adapt to novel tasks and user\\npreferences without overburdening the user. While prior interactive robot\\nlearning methods aim to reduce human effort, they are typically limited to\\nsingle-task scenarios and are not well-suited for sustained, multi-task\\ncollaboration. We propose COIL (Cost-Optimal Interactive Learning) -- a\\nmulti-task interaction planner that minimizes human effort across a sequence of\\ntasks by strategically selecting among three query types (skill, preference,\\nand help). When user preferences are known, we formulate COIL as an\\nuncapacitated facility location (UFL) problem, which enables bounded-suboptimal\\nplanning in polynomial time using off-the-shelf approximation algorithms. We\\nextend our formulation to handle uncertainty in user preferences by\\nincorporating one-step belief space planning, which uses these approximation\\nalgorithms as subroutines to maintain polynomial-time performance. Simulated\\nand physical experiments on manipulation tasks show that our framework\\nsignificantly reduces the amount of work allocated to the human while\\nmaintaining successful task completion.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T12:45:09Z\"}"}
