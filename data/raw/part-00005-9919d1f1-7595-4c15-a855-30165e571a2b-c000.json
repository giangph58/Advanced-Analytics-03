{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12297v1\", \"title\": \"Optimal flock formation induced by agent heterogeneity\", \"summary\": \"The study of flocking in biological systems has identified conditions for\\nself-organized collective behavior, inspiring the development of decentralized\\nstrategies to coordinate the dynamics of swarms of drones and other autonomous\\nvehicles. Previous research has focused primarily on the role of the\\ntime-varying interaction network among agents while assuming that the agents\\nthemselves are identical or nearly identical. Here, we depart from this\\nconventional assumption to investigate how inter-individual differences between\\nagents affect the stability and convergence in flocking dynamics. We show that\\nflocks of agents with optimally assigned heterogeneous parameters significantly\\noutperform their homogeneous counterparts, achieving 20-40% faster convergence\\nto desired formations across various control tasks. These tasks include target\\ntracking, flock formation, and obstacle maneuvering. In systems with\\ncommunication delays, heterogeneity can enable convergence even when flocking\\nis unstable for identical agents. Our results challenge existing paradigms in\\nmulti-agent control and establish system disorder as an adaptive, distributed\\nmechanism to promote collective behavior in flocking dynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn,cs.SY,eess.SY,math.DS,math.OC,nlin.AO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T17:58:07Z\"}"}
