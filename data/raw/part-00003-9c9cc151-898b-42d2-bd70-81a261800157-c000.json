{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00686v1\", \"title\": \"Quantum information engines: Bounds on performance metrics by\\n  measurement time\", \"summary\": \"Information engines, sometimes referred to as Maxwell Demon engines, utilize\\ninformation obtained through measurement to control the conversion of energy\\ninto useful work. Discussions around such devices often assume the measurement\\nstep to be instantaneous, assessing its cost by Landauer's information erasure\\nwithin the measurement device. While this simplified perspective is sufficient\\nfor classical feedback-controlled engines, for nanoengines that often operate\\nin the quantum realm, the overall performance may be significantly affected by\\nthe measurement duration (which may be comparable to the engine's cycle time)\\nand cost (energy needed to create the system-meter correlation). In this study,\\nwe employ a generalized von-Neumann measurement model to highlight that\\nobtaining a finite amount of information requires a finite measurement time and\\nincurs an energetic cost. We investigate the crucial role of these factors in\\ndetermining the engine's performance, particularly in terms of efficiency and\\npower output. Furthermore, for the information engine model under\\nconsideration, we establish a precise relationship between the acquired\\ninformation in the measurement process and the maximum energy extractable\\nthrough the measurement. We also discuss ways to extend our considerations\\nusing these concepts, such as in measurement-enhanced photochemical reactions.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T17:48:00Z\"}"}
