{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19889v1\", \"title\": \"Queue or lounge: strategic design for strategic customer\", \"summary\": \"Considering an M/M/1 queue with an additional lounge facility (LF), the quest\\nof this paper is to understand the instances when LF is an attractive option,\\nfrom customer perspective as well as from system perspective: will the\\ncustomers choose to join the queue or prefer to detour briefly to lounge? In\\nreality, customers do not perform complex computations for such tasks, but\\ninstead choose based on some heuristics. We further assume that the customers\\npessimistically anticipate the future congestion while making the choice. Our\\nanalysis reveals that the customers use the LF only when the queue is too\\ncrowded, and the lounge is relatively empty; however, strikingly, the customer\\nchoice is more inclined towards rejection for the LF in systems with higher\\ntraffic (load).\\n  We also explore an optimization problem where the system determines whether\\nto implement an LF and what capacity it should have, while accounting for\\ncustomers' behavioral responses. Under low load conditions, the system benefits\\nfrom designing a high-capacity lounge, and the customers also prefer to use the\\nLF actively. Surprisingly, neither the system prefers big LF, nor the customers\\nprefer to use the LF profusely at high load conditions; optimal for either is\\nto use the LF sparingly. Thus, importantly, the strategic system and the\\nbounded-rational customers are not in a tug-of-war situation.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:23:30Z\"}"}
