{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17318v1\", \"title\": \"Skills Beget Skills: Evidence from Historical School Reforms Targeting\\n  Health and Further Education\", \"summary\": \"This paper investigates the dynamic complementarity between school health and\\neducation reforms implemented in Denmark between 1940 and 1965: the\\nintroduction of school doctors and the expansion of secondary education. Using\\na staggered difference-in-differences approach for multiple treatments, we\\nstudy the reform effects on individuals' outcomes in the ages 55-64. We find\\nthat each reform leads to significant improvements in health and education\\noutcomes, including reduced mortality, fewer hospitalizations, and higher\\neducational attainment. The singular impact of each reform is doubled when both\\nreforms are implemented together, resulting in a 9 percent increase in\\nearnings. These findings underscore high societal returns to complementary\\nschool investments in the long term.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T07:21:06Z\"}"}
