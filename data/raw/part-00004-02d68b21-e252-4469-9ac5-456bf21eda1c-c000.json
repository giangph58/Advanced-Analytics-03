We observed a crossover of the superconductivity with\\nincreasing $P$ near the end point of antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase, where two\\nsuperconducting phases coexist within a pressure width of $\\\\Delta$$P$$\\\\sim$1\\nGPa, having different $T_{\\\\rm c}$s. These results suggest that the\\nsuperconducting phases inside and outside the AFM phase have different origins.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T06:12:41Z\"}"}
