{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21301v1\", \"title\": \"Reevaluating UMa3/U1: star cluster or the smallest known galaxy?\", \"summary\": \"Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1 (UMa3/U1) is the faintest Milky Way satellite\\ndiscovered to date, exhibiting a half-light radius of 3 $\\\\pm$ 1 pc and an\\nabsolute V-band magnitude of +2.2 $\\\\pm$ 0.4. Previous studies suggest UMa3/U1\\nis a dwarf galaxy, based on its large internal velocity dispersion and the\\nimprobability (indicated by dynamical cluster simulations) of its long-term\\nsurvival if it were a dark-matter-free star cluster. In this paper, we model\\nthe evolution of UMa3/U1 as a star cluster using collisional N-body simulations\\nthat include a description of stellar evolution and the external tidal field of\\nthe Milky Way, with some simulations including primordial binaries. We find\\nthat UMa3/U1 has a substantial remaining lifetime of 2.7 $\\\\pm$ 0.4 Gyr,\\nprimarily due to the retention of compact stellar remnants within the cluster.\\nThis retention is facilitated by mass segregation and the preferential loss of\\nlow-mass stars. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the observed large velocity\\ndispersion of UMa3/U1 can be successfully reproduced. These results support the\\npossibility that UMa3/U1 is a self-gravitating star cluster. Our simulations\\nreveal that modelling UMa3/U1 as a dark matter free star cluster produces a\\nmarkedly altered present-day mass function, driven by a strong depletion of\\nlow-mass stars. However, the degree of mass segregation among the visible stars\\nis not statistically significant. We therefore recommend that future\\nobservations of UMa3/U1 and other very small Milky Way satellites focus on\\nmeasuring their present-day mass functions to determine their nature.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T04:23:10Z\"}"}
