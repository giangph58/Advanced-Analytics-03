The opinion dynamics models that we take into\\nconsideration allow for negative interactions between the individuals, whose\\nopinions can thus grow apart. We consider both the repelling and the opposing\\nmodels of negative interactions, which have been studied in the literature. We\\ndefine the repelling and the opposing dynamics on signed graphons and we show\\nthat their initial value problem solutions exist and are unique. We then show\\nthat, in a suitable sense, the graphon dynamics is a good approximation of the\\ndynamics on large graphs that converge to a graphon. This result applies to\\nlarge random graphs that are sampled according to a graphon (W-random graphs),\\nfor which we provide a new convergence result under very general assumptions.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T14:41:37Z\"}"}
