{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05240v1\", \"title\": \"Bayesian local clustering of age-period mortality surfaces across\\n  multiple countries\", \"summary\": \"Although traditional literature on mortality modeling has focused on single\\ncountries in isolation, recent contributions have progressively moved toward\\njoint models for multiple countries. Besides favoring borrowing of information\\nto improve age-period forecasts, this perspective has also potentials to infer\\nlocal similarities among countries' mortality patterns in specific age classes\\nand periods that could unveil unexplored demographic trends, while guiding the\\ndesign of targeted policies. Advancements along this latter relevant direction\\nare currently undermined by the lack of a multi-country model capable of\\nincorporating the core structures of age-period mortality surfaces together\\nwith clustering patterns among countries that are not global, but rather vary\\nlocally across different combinations of ages and periods. We cover this gap by\\ndeveloping a novel Bayesian model for log-mortality rates that characterizes\\nthe age structure of mortality through a B-spline expansion whose\\ncountry-specific dynamic coefficients encode both changes of this age structure\\nacross periods and also local clustering patterns among countries under a\\ntime-dependent random partition prior for these country-specific dynamic\\ncoefficients. While flexible, this formulation admits tractable posterior\\ninference leveraging a suitably-designed Gibbs-sampler. The application to\\nmortality data from 14 countries unveils local similarities highlighting both\\npreviously-recognized demographic phenomena and also yet-unexplored trends.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP,stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T16:23:19Z\"}"}
