We augment a pretrained and\\nwell-established Euclidean model based on a Tucker tensor decomposition with a\\nnovel hyperbolic interaction term. This correction enables more nuanced\\ncapturing of distributional properties in data better aligned with real-world\\nknowledge graphs. By combining two geometries together, our approach improves\\nexpressivity of the resulting model achieving new state-of-the-art link\\nprediction accuracy with a significantly lower number of parameters compared to\\nthe previous Euclidean and hyperbolic models.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.IR,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T13:54:43Z\"}"}
