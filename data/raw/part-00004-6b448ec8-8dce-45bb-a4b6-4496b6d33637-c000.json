Traditional machine learning methods such as support vector\\nmachines (SVM) and XGBoost rely on predefined molecular representations, often\\nleading to information loss and potential bias. In contrast, deep learning\\napproaches-particularly Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)-offer a more\\nexpressive and unbiased alternative by operating directly on molecular graphs.\\nMeanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated\\nstate-of-the-art performance in drug design, thanks to their capacity to\\ncapture complex chemical patterns from large-scale data via attention\\nmechanisms.\\n  In this paper, we propose a hybrid architecture that integrates GCNs with\\nLLM-derived embeddings to combine localized structural learning with global\\nchemical knowledge. The LLM embeddings can be precomputed and stored in a\\nmolecular feature library, removing the need to rerun the LLM during training\\nor inference and thus maintaining computational efficiency. We found that\\nconcatenating the LLM embeddings after each GCN layer-rather than only at the\\nfinal layer-significantly improves performance, enabling deeper integration of\\nglobal context throughout the network. The resulting model achieves superior\\nresults, with an F1-score of (88.8%), outperforming standalone GCN (87.9%),\\nXGBoost (85.5%), and SVM (85.4%) baselines.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T12:38:03Z\"}"}
