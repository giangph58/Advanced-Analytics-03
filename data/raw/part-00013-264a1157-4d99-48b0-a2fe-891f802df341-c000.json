{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20993v1\", \"title\": \"GDP-GFCF Dynamics Across Global Economies: A Comparative Study of Panel\\n  Regressions and Random Forest\", \"summary\": \"This study examines the relationship between GDP growth and Gross Fixed\\nCapital Formation (GFCF) across developed economies (G7, EU-15, OECD) and\\nemerging markets (BRICS). We integrate Random Forest machine learning\\n(non-linear regression) with traditional econometric models (linear regression)\\nto better capture non-linear interactions in investment analysis. Our findings\\nreveal that while GDP growth positively influences corporate investment, its\\nimpact varies significantly by region. Developed economies show stronger\\nGDP-GFCF linkages due to stable financial systems, while emerging markets\\ndemonstrate weaker connections due to economic heterogeneity and structural\\nconstraints. Random Forest models indicate that GDP growth's importance is\\nlower than suggested by traditional econometrics, with lagged GFCF emerging as\\nthe dominant predictor-confirming investment follows path-dependent patterns\\nrather than short-term GDP fluctuations. Regional variations in investment\\ndrivers are substantial: taxation significantly influences developed economies\\nbut minimally affects BRICS, while unemployment strongly drives investment in\\nBRICS but less so elsewhere. We introduce a parallelized p-value importance\\nalgorithm for Random Forest that enhances computational efficiency while\\nmaintaining statistical rigor through sequential testing methods (SPRT and\\nSAPT). The research demonstrates that hybrid methodologies combining machine\\nlearning with econometric techniques provide more nuanced understanding of\\ninvestment dynamics, supporting region-specific policy design and improving\\nforecasting accuracy.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:58:47Z\"}"}
