This EoS is applied to derive opacities and\\ncalculate the yields of isotopes formed in r-process and s-process\\nnucleosynthesis, with and without the influence of neutrino masses or\\noscillations. We look at both the lanthanide and actinide sequences using the\\nMvdW parameters that involve the interaction strength and excluded volume\\neffects. Our results reflect the characteristic differences found in r and s\\nprocesses in the synthesis and long-term evolution of isotopes from the U, Th,\\nand Sr chain across galactic environments. The inclusion of neutrino masses\\nenhances the neutron-to-proton ratio, favoring heavier r-process isotopes and\\naltering the overall galactic yields by cross section suppression. These\\nfindings offer insights into the interplay of nuclear physics and astrophysical\\nenvironments, highlighting the sensitivity of nucleosynthetic pathways to EoS\\nmodifications and neutrino physics. We compare these results to metallicity\\nprofiles of similar models: the Galactic Leaky Box, the Galactic Inflow, and\\nthe Galactic Closed Box models and to the kilonova event GW170781.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T16:34:31Z\"}"}
