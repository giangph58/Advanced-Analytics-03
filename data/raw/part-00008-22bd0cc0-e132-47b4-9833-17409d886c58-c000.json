Therefore, a quantitative understanding of how\\nthis process depends on loading parameters is critical for optimizing\\nmechanical amorphization and tuning material performance. In this study, we\\nemploy molecular dynamics simulations to investigate oscillatory\\ndeformation-induced amorphization in three glass-forming intermetallic systems,\\naddressing two unresolved challenges: (1) the relationship between\\namorphization efficiency and mechanical loading, and (2) energy absorption\\ndynamics during crystal-to-amorphous (CTA) transitions. Our results demonstrate\\na decoupling between amorphization efficiency--governed by work rate and\\ndescribed by an effective temperature model--and energy absorption, which\\nadheres to the Herschel-Bulkley constitutive relation. Crucially, the melting\\nenthalpy emerges as a key determinant of the energy barrier, establishing a\\nthermodynamic analogy between mechanical amorphization and thermally induced\\nmelting. This relationship provides a universally applicable metric to quantify\\namorphization kinetics. By unifying material properties and loading conditions,\\nthis work establishes a predictive framework for controlling amorphization\\nprocesses. These findings advance the fundamental understanding of\\ndeformation-driven phase transitions and offer practical guidelines for\\ndesigning materials with tailored properties for ultrafast fabrication, ball\\nmilling, and advanced mechanical processing techniques.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:37:56Z\"}"}
