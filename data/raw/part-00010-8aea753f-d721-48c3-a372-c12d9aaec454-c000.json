In this paper,\\nwe propose a unified localization method that integrates model-based and\\nmachine learning (ML)-based methods to reap their respective advantages by\\nexploiting available map information. In order to avoid supervised learning, we\\ngenerate training labels automatically via optimal transport (OT) by fusing\\ngeometric estimates with building layouts. Ray-tracing based simulations are\\ncarried out to demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves\\npositioning accuracy for both line-of-sight (LoS) users (compared to ML-based\\nmethods) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) users (compared to model-based methods).\\nRemarkably, the unified method is able to achieve competitive overall\\nperformance with the fully-supervised fingerprinting, while eliminating the\\nneed for cumbersome labeled data measurement and collection.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP,cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:45:54Z\"}"}
