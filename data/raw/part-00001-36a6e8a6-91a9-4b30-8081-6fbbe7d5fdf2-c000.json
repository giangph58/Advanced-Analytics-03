{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05088v1\", \"title\": \"SSH-Net: A Self-Supervised and Hybrid Network for Noisy Image Watermark\\n  Removal\", \"summary\": \"Visible watermark removal is challenging due to its inherent complexities and\\nthe noise carried within images. Existing methods primarily rely on supervised\\nlearning approaches that require paired datasets of watermarked and\\nwatermark-free images, which are often impractical to obtain in real-world\\nscenarios. To address this challenge, we propose SSH-Net, a Self-Supervised and\\nHybrid Network specifically designed for noisy image watermark removal. SSH-Net\\nsynthesizes reference watermark-free images using the watermark distribution in\\na self-supervised manner and adopts a dual-network design to address the task.\\nThe upper network, focused on the simpler task of noise removal, employs a\\nlightweight CNN-based architecture, while the lower network, designed to handle\\nthe more complex task of simultaneously removing watermarks and noise,\\nincorporates Transformer blocks to model long-range dependencies and capture\\nintricate image features. To enhance the model's effectiveness, a shared\\nCNN-based feature encoder is introduced before dual networks to extract common\\nfeatures that both networks can leverage. Our code will be available at\\nhttps://github.com/wenyang001/SSH-Net.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MM\", \"categories\": \"cs.MM,cs.CV,eess.IV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T09:36:49Z\"}"}
