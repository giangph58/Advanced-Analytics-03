This study aims to forecast\\nagricultural production in Maharashtra, India, which utilises annual data from\\nthe year 1962 to 2021. Since rainfall plays a major role with respect to the\\ncrop yield, we analyze the impact of rainfall on crop yield using four time\\nseries models that includes ARIMA, ARIMAX, GARCH-ARIMA and GARCH-ARIMAX. We\\ntake advantage of rainfall as an external regressor to examine if it\\ncontributes to the performance of the model. 1-step, 2-step, and 3-step ahead\\nforecasts are obtained and the model performance is assessed using MAE and\\nRMSE. The models are able to more accurately predict when using rainfall as a\\npredictor compared to when solely dependant on historical production trends\\n(more improved outcomes are seen in the ARIMAX and GARCH-ARIMAX models). As\\nsuch, these findings underscore the need for climate-aware forecasting\\ntechniques that provide useful information to policymakers and farmers to aid\\nin agricultural planning.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T11:30:37Z\"}"}
