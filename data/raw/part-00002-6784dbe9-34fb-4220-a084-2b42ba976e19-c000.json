{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21560v1\", \"title\": \"Plausible Indication of Gamma-Ray Absorption by Dark Matter in NGC 1068\", \"summary\": \"NGC 1068 is the brightest extragalactic source in high-energy neutrinos as\\nseen by IceCube, yet the accompanying gamma-ray flux is orders of magnitude\\nweaker. It has been argued that this indicates that the bulk of neutrinos and\\ngamma rays are emitted in the innermost vicinity of the central supermassive\\nblack hole, which is transparent to neutrinos, but opaque to gamma rays. Even\\nin such extreme scenarios for the acceleration of cosmic rays, astrophysical\\nmodels typically overestimate the low-energy gamma-ray flux and/or require some\\nfine-tuning in the physical parameters. Here we suggest instead that the dark\\nmatter surrounding the supermassive black hole may absorb the gamma rays,\\ninducing the observed deficit. We show that for a dark matter-photon scattering\\ncross section in the range $\\\\sigma_{\\\\rm DM-\\\\gamma}/m_{\\\\rm DM} \\\\simeq\\n10^{-28}-10^{-30}$ cm$^2$/GeV, Fermi-LAT measurements can be well reconciled\\nwith IceCube data. We also present some simple particle physics examples that\\nachieve the correct spectral energy dependence while respecting complementary\\nconstraints.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T11:59:02Z\"}"}
