We find that in presence of a time\\nderivative of the scalar field, driven by the cosmological expansion, this\\nregularity generically imposes large scalar charges for black holes, even when\\nassuming strictly no direct coupling of matter to the scalar field. Such\\ncharges cause a significant accretion of the scalar field by the black holes,\\ndriving its local time derivative to a small value. This phenomenon, together\\nwith the Vainshtein screening typical of these theories, strongly suppresses\\nobservable scalar effects. We show that this full class of models is consistent\\nwith LIGO/Virgo detections of gravitational waves, but that the LISA mission\\nshould be able to constrain the coefficient of the quintic term at the\\n$10^{-30}$ level in a self-acceleration scenario, an improvement by 16 orders\\nof magnitude with respect to what is imposed by the speed of gravitational\\nwaves.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:55:38Z\"}"}
