{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02629v1\", \"title\": \"An efficient and energy-stable IMEX splitting scheme for dispersed\\n  multiphase flows\", \"summary\": \"Volume-averaged Navier--Stokes equations are used in various applications to\\nmodel systems with two or more interpenetrating phases. Each fluid obeys its\\nown momentum and mass equations, and the phases are typically coupled via drag\\nforces and a shared pressure. Monolithic solvers can therefore be very\\nexpensive and difficult to implement. On the other hand, designing robust\\nsplitting schemes requires making both pressure and drag forces explicit\\nwithout sacrificing temporal stability. In this context, we derive a new\\nfirst-order pressure-correction method based on the incompressibility of the\\nmean velocity field, combined with an explicit treatment of the drag forces.\\nFurthermore, the convective terms are linearised using extrapolated velocities,\\nwhile the viscous terms are treated semi-implicitly. This gives us an\\nimplicit-explicit (IMEX) method that is very robust not only due to its\\nunconditional energy stability, but also because it does not require any type\\nof fixed-point iterations. Each time step involves only linear, scalar\\ntransport equations and a single Poisson problem as building blocks, thereby\\noffering both efficiency and simplicity. We rigorously prove temporal stability\\nwithout any time-step size restrictions, and the theory is confirmed through\\ntwo-phase numerical examples.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:27:53Z\"}"}
