However, apart from the experimental uncertainties, the\\ngeneric mechanism of Hall crystals, especially those with fractional\\n$\\\\sigma_\\\\mathrm{H}$ is still elusive at the microscopic level. In this work, we\\nnumerically study a topological flat-band model and find that, the Chern band\\ncan be folded by the interaction-driven CDW, and a mini Chern band appears\\nabove the CDW gap. Through further analysis, we find the energy dispersion and\\nthe fluctuation of quantum geometry of the miniband could be flattened by\\ncompeting interactions. When further doping this miniband, a series of (F)QAH\\nstates are found to coexist with the CDW order at (fractional)integer fillings\\nof the miniband and the Hall conductivities of the FQAH crystals (FQAHCs)-\\ndetermined by the fillings of the miniband - are different from the fillings of\\nthe original Chern band. We also study the thermodynamics of an FQAHC state and\\nfind the separation of energy scales and a compressible CDW phase at\\nintermediate temperatures. Our work paves the way for the systematic\\nunderstanding of (fractional) Hall crystals.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T05:25:02Z\"}"}
