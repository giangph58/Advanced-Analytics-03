Here we show that the\\nentropic uncertainty relation (EUR) is able to connect intrinsically generic\\nquantum contextuality and nonlocal entanglement. Based on a local scenario, it\\nis proven rigorously that the EUR with optimal measurements can faithfully\\nwitness the preparation contextuality addressed in the pioneering work by\\nSpekkens. From a nonlocal viewpoint, we show that the single-party\\ncontextuality and two-party entanglement are related by the EUR with quantum\\nmemories, which is captured by a trade-off inequality that limits the\\nnonclassicality distribution for a composite quantum system. Moreover, we\\nderive another kind of trade-off inequality between quantum contextuality and\\nBell nonlocality. It is revealed that both inequalities can be probed\\nexperimentally, and two well-designed independent experiments are performed to\\nverify our theoretical predictions in superconducting qubits.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T14:40:28Z\"}"}
