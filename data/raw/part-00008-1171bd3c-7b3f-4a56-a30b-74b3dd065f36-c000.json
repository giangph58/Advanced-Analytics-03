One reason is that we cannot\\ndetermine the isomorphism classes of singular curves themselves from their\\n\\\\'{e}tale or tame fundamental groups in general. On the other hand, Das proved\\nthat the structure of the tame fundamental group of a singular curve over an\\nalgebraically closed field is determined by its normalization and an invariant\\nrelating to its singularities. In the present paper, by using this and known\\nanabelian results, we determine the isomorphism classes of the normalizations\\nof singular curves over various fields under certain conditions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG,math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T04:06:22Z\"}"}
