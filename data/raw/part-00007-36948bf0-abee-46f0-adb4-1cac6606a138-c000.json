In this paper, we show how the Rational\\nSpeech Acts (RSA), a linguistics framework used to minimize the number of\\nfeatures to be communicated when identifying an object in a set, can be adapted\\nto the IR case -- and in particular to the high number of potential features\\n(here, tokens). RSA dynamically modulates token-document interactions by\\nconsidering the influence of other documents in the dataset, better contrasting\\ndocument representations. Experiments show that incorporating RSA consistently\\nimproves multiple sparse retrieval models and achieves state-of-the-art\\nperformance on out-of-domain datasets from the BEIR benchmark.\\nhttps://github.com/arthur-75/Rational-Retrieval-Acts\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR,cs.CL,H.3\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T16:21:10Z\"}"}
