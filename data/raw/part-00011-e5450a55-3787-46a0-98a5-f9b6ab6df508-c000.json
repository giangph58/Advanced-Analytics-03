{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11866v1\", \"title\": \"On the Problem of Best Arm Retention\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents a comprehensive study on the problem of Best Arm\\nRetention (BAR), which has recently found applications in streaming algorithms\\nfor multi-armed bandits. In the BAR problem, the goal is to retain $m$ arms\\nwith the best arm included from $n$ after some trials, in stochastic\\nmulti-armed bandit settings. We first investigate pure exploration for the BAR\\nproblem under different criteria, and then minimize the regret with specific\\nconstraints, in the context of further exploration in streaming algorithms.\\n  - We begin by revisiting the lower bound for the $(\\\\varepsilon,\\\\delta)$-PAC\\nalgorithm for Best Arm Identification (BAI) and adapt the classical\\nKL-divergence argument to derive optimal bounds for $(\\\\varepsilon,\\\\delta)$-PAC\\nalgorithms for BAR.\\n  - We further study another variant of the problem, called $r$-BAR, which\\nrequires the expected gap between the best arm and the optimal arm retained is\\nless than $r$. We prove tight sample complexity for the problem.\\n  - We explore the regret minimization problem for $r$-BAR and develop\\nalgorithm beyond pure exploration. We conclude with a conjecture on the optimal\\nregret in this setting.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T08:41:20Z\"}"}
