This inverse problem\\nfinds its motivation in the reconstruction of mechanical properties of tissues\\nin medical diagnostics. We first assume that the Lam\\\\'e parameters ($\\\\lambda,\\n\\\\mu$) are know and we look for the inverse problem of recovering the density\\n$\\\\rho$. In this context, we derive a constrcutive Lipschitz stability estimate\\nin terms of the Neumann to Dirichlet map in the case of piecewise constant\\nparameters. Then, we look for the inverse problem of recovering $\\\\lambda$,\\n$\\\\mu$ and $\\\\rho$ simultameousely.\\n  We establish Lipschitz stability estimate, provided that the parameters\\n$\\\\lambda$, $\\\\mu$ and $\\\\rho$ have upper and lower bounds and belong to a known\\nfinite-dimensional subspace. The proofs hinge on monotonicity relations between\\nthe parameters and the Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator, coupled with the\\ntechniques of localized potentials.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T10:39:33Z\"}"}
