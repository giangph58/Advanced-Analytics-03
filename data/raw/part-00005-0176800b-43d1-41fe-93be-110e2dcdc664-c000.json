{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20636v1\", \"title\": \"Quasiperiodic Slow-Propagating EUV \\\"Wave\\\" Trains After the Filament\\n  Eruption\", \"summary\": \"The eruption of the filament/flux rope generates the coronal perturbations,\\nwhich further form EUV waves. There are two types of EUV waves, including\\nfast-mode magnetosonic waves and slow waves. In this paper, we first report an\\nevent showing the Quasiperiodic Slow-Propagating (QSP) EUV \\\"wave\\\" trains during\\nan M6.4-class flare (SOL2023-02-25T18:40), using multiple observations from\\nSDO/AIA, CHASE/HIS, ASO-S/FMG, SUTRI, and LASCO/C2. The QSP \\\"wave\\\" trains\\noccurred as the filament showed a rapid rise. The QSP \\\"wave\\\" trains have the\\nprojected speeds of 50-130 km s$^{-1}$ on the plane of the sky, which is slower\\nthan the fast-mode magnetosonic speed in the solar corona. And the calculated\\nperiod of the QSP wave trains is 117.9 s, which is in good agreement with the\\nassociated flare Quasi-Periodic Pulsation (140.3 s). The QSP wave trains could\\nbe observed during the entire impulsive phase of the flare and lasted about 30\\nminutes in the field of view (FOV) of SDO/AIA. About 30 minutes later, they\\nappeared in the FOV of LASCO/C2 and propagated to the northwest. We suggest\\nthat the QSP wave trains are probably apparent waves that are caused by the\\nsuccessive stretching of the inclined field lines overlying the eruptive\\nfilament. The periodic pattern of the QSP wave trains may be related to the\\nintermittent energy release during the flare.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T11:06:51Z\"}"}
