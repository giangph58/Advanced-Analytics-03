Our work is a proof of principle for how force-sensitive\\nproteins and molecular motors can form the basis of a general strategy to learn\\nin biological systems. Our work identifies a minimal biologically plausible\\nlearning mechanism and also explores its implications for commonly occuring\\nphenomenolgy such as adaptation and homeostatis.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,physics.bio-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T13:58:29Z\"}"}
