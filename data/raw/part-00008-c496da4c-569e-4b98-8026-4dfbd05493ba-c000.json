To address data limitations in studying MSSA sepsis, we extend\\nexisting transfer learning frameworks to accommodate transformation models for\\nhigh-dimensional survival data. Specifically, we construct a measurement index\\nbased on C-index for intelligently identifying the helpful source datasets, and\\nthe target model performance is improved by leveraging information from the\\nidentified source datasets via performing the transfer step and debiasing step.\\nWe further provide an algorithm to construct confidence intervals for each\\ncoefficient component. Another significant development is that statistical\\nproperties are rigorously established, including $\\\\ell_1/\\\\ell_2$-estimation\\nerror bounds of the transfer learning algorithm, detection consistency property\\nof the transferable source detection algorithm and asymptotic theories for the\\nconfidence interval construction. Extensive simulations and analysis of\\nMIMIC-IV sepsis data demonstrate the estimation and prediction accuracy, and\\npractical advantages of our approach, providing significant improvements in\\nsurvival estimates for MSSA sepsis patients.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:12:25Z\"}"}
