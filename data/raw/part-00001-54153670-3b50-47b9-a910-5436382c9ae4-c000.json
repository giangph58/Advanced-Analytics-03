{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20596v1\", \"title\": \"The Anyonic Quantum Carnot Engine\", \"summary\": \"Combining two disparate lines of thought like thermodynamics and quantum\\nmechanics yields surprising results. The resulting idea of quantum\\nthermodynamic engines holds promise for harvesting novel sources of energy of\\npurely quantum origin, like quantum statistics, to extract mechanical work from\\nmacroscopic quantum systems like Bose-Einstein condensates. It also allows one\\nto explore thermodynamic thinking to `small' systems consisting only a few\\nparticles in quantum theory. In an earlier paper we had studied the quantum\\nOtto engine using a small number of one-dimensional anyons as the medium to\\ndrive the thermodynamic engine. In this sequel, we study the gold-standard of\\nthermodynamic engines, namely the Carnot engine, using two-dimensional anyons\\nas the medium. An explicit expression is derived for the efficiency of the\\nanyonic quantum Carnot engine.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T09:49:28Z\"}"}
