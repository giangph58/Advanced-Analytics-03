By analytically continuing in the spin, we derive a formula\\nfor computing these structure constants at any coupling in the small-spin\\nlimit, up to a normalization factor. This formula allows us to explore their\\nanalytical properties at strong coupling. In this regime, using classical\\nstring calculations and a suitable ansatz, we extend our analysis to\\nfinite-spin operators, verifying recent two-loop results for structure\\nconstants in string theory and generalizing them to operators with arbitrary\\nR-charges.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:39:49Z\"}"}
