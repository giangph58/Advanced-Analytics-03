While conventional antiferromagnetic systems inherently\\nsuppress this effect through parity-time symmetry-mediated cancellation of\\nMagnus forces acting on skyrmions, A-SkHE is primarily confined to\\nferromagnetic platforms. Here, we present a paradigm-shifting demonstration of\\nthis phenomenon in spin-splitting 2D antiferromagnets through the investigation\\nof altermagnetic skyrmions. Combining comprehensive symmetry analysis with\\ntheoretical modeling, we elucidate the mechanism governing A-SkHE realization\\nin 2D altermagnetic systems and establish a quantitative relationship between\\nthe transverse velocity of altermagnetic skyrmions and applied current\\norientation. Using first-principles calculations and micromagnetic simulations,\\nthis mechanism is further illustrated in a prototypical altermagnetic monolayer\\nV2SeTeO. Crucially, we identify that the [C2C4zt] symmetry-protected\\nanisotropic field serves as the critical stabilizer for maintaining the A-SkHE\\nin this system. Our results greatly enrich the research on 2D altermagnetism\\nand skyrmions.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T11:51:04Z\"}"}
