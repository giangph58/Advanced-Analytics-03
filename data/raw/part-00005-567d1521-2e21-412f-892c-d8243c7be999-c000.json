{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02450v1\", \"title\": \"CHARMS: Cognitive Hierarchical Agent with Reasoning and Motion Styles\", \"summary\": \"To address the current challenges of low intelligence and simplistic vehicle\\nbehavior modeling in autonomous driving simulation scenarios, this paper\\nproposes the Cognitive Hierarchical Agent with Reasoning and Motion Styles\\n(CHARMS). The model can reason about the behavior of other vehicles like a\\nhuman driver and respond with different decision-making styles, thereby\\nimproving the intelligence and diversity of the surrounding vehicles in the\\ndriving scenario. By introducing the Level-k behavioral game theory, the paper\\nmodels the decision-making process of human drivers and employs deep\\nreinforcement learning to train the models with diverse decision styles,\\nsimulating different reasoning approaches and behavioral characteristics.\\nBuilding on the Poisson cognitive hierarchy theory, this paper also presents a\\nnovel driving scenario generation method. The method controls the proportion of\\nvehicles with different driving styles in the scenario using Poisson and\\nbinomial distributions, thus generating controllable and diverse driving\\nenvironments. Experimental results demonstrate that CHARMS not only exhibits\\nsuperior decision-making capabilities as ego vehicles, but also generates more\\ncomplex and diverse driving scenarios as surrounding vehicles. We will release\\ncode for CHARMS at https://github.com/WUTAD-Wjy/CHARMS.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T10:15:19Z\"}"}
