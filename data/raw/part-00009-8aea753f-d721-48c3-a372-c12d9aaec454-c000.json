This paper presents a Genetic Algorithm\\n(GA)-based approach for Virtual Machine (VM) placement and consolidation,\\naiming to minimize power usage while maintaining QoS constraints. The proposed\\nmethod dynamically adjusts VM allocation based on real-time workload\\nvariations, outperforming traditional heuristics such as First Fit Decreasing\\n(FFD) and Best Fit Decreasing (BFD). Experimental results show notable\\nreductions in energy consumption, VM migrations, SLA violation rates, and\\nexecution time. A correlation heatmap further illustrates strong relationships\\namong these key performance indicators, confirming the effectiveness of our\\napproach in optimizing cloud resource utilization.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:45:40Z\"}"}
