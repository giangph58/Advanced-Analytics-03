To address this, we propose a neuro-symbolic\\nexplanation framework that generates a weighted signal temporal logic (wSTL)\\nspecification to describe a robot policy in a interpretable form. Existing\\nmethods typically produce explanations that are verbose and inconsistent, which\\nhinders explainability, and loose, which do not give meaningful insights into\\nthe underlying policy. We address these issues by introducing a simplification\\nprocess consisting of predicate filtering, regularization, and iterative\\npruning. We also introduce three novel explainability evaluation metrics --\\nconciseness, consistency, and strictness -- to assess explanation quality\\nbeyond conventional classification metrics. Our method is validated in three\\nsimulated robotic environments, where it outperforms baselines in generating\\nconcise, consistent, and strict wSTL explanations without sacrificing\\nclassification accuracy. This work bridges policy learning with formal methods,\\ncontributing to safer and more transparent decision-making in robotics.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.FL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:51:20Z\"}"}
