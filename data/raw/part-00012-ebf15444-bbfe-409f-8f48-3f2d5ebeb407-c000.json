{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02387v1\", \"title\": \"Sublinear Time Algorithms for Abelian Group Isomorphism and Basis\\n  Construction\", \"summary\": \"In his paper, we study the problems of abelian group isomorphism and basis\\nconstruction in two models. In the {\\\\it partially specified model} (PS-model),\\nthe algorithm does not know the group size but can access randomly chosen\\nelements of the group along with the Cayley table of those elements, which\\nprovides the result of the binary operation for every pair of selected\\nelements. In the stronger {\\\\it fully specified model} (FS-model), the algorithm\\nknows the size of the group and has access to its elements and Cayley table.\\n  Given two abelian groups, $G$, and $H$, we present an algorithm in the\\nPS-model (and hence in the FS-model) that runs in time $\\\\tilde O(\\\\sqrt{|G|})$\\nand decides if they are isomorphic. This improves on Kavitha's linear-time\\nalgorithm and gives the first sublinear-time solution for this problem. We then\\nprove the lower bound $\\\\Omega(|G|^{1/4})$ for the FS-model and the tight bound\\n$\\\\Omega(\\\\sqrt{|G|})$ for the PS-model. This is the first known lower bound for\\nthis problem. We obtain similar results for finding a basis for abelian groups.\\nFor deterministic algorithms, a simple $\\\\Omega(|G|)$ lower bound is given.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CC\", \"categories\": \"cs.CC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T08:28:28Z\"}"}
