{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14837v1\", \"title\": \"SQL-Factory: A Multi-Agent Framework for High-Quality and Large-Scale\\n  SQL Generation\", \"summary\": \"Hight quality SQL corpus is essential for intelligent database. For example,\\nText-to-SQL requires SQL queries and correspond natural language questions as\\ntraining samples. However, collecting such query corpus remains challenging in\\npractice due to the high cost of manual annotation, which highlights the\\nimportance of automatic SQL generation. Despite recent advances, existing\\ngeneration methods still face limitations in achieving both diversity and\\ncost-effectiveness. Besides, many methods also treat all tables equally during\\ngeneration, which overlooks schema complexity and leads to under-utilization of\\nstructurally rich tables. To address these issues, this paper proposes a\\nmulti-agent framework for high-quality and large-scale SQL generation, dubbed\\nSQL-Factory. It decomposes the generation process into three collaborative\\nteams: the Generation Team explores diverse query structures using large\\nlanguage models, the Expansion Team scales promising patterns via lightweight\\nlocal models, and the Management Team adaptively schedules and evaluates\\ngeneration based on schema coverage and real-time query quality. This modular\\nframework ensures a balanced trade-off between diversity, scalability, and\\ngeneration cost. We apply SQL-Factory to four widely used benchmarks and\\ngenerate over 300,000 executable and broadly distributed SQL queries with less\\nthan $200 API cost. Our generated queries achieve higher diversity compared to\\nother methods, and extensive experiments demonstrate that the generated queries\\nsignificantly improve the model performance in various downstream tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DB\", \"categories\": \"cs.DB\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T03:37:43Z\"}"}
