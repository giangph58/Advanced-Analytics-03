{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07674v1\", \"title\": \"Is the atmospheric river operating at a self-organized criticality\\n  state?\", \"summary\": \"Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are essential components of the global hydrological\\ncycle, with profound implications for water resources, extreme weather events,\\nand climate dynamics. Yet, the statistical organization and underlying physical\\nmechanisms of AR intensity and evolution remain poorly understood. Here we\\napply methods from statistical physics to analyze the full life cycle of ARs\\nand identify universal signatures of self-organized criticality (SOC). We\\ndemonstrate that AR morphology exhibits nontrivial fractal geometry, while AR\\nevent sizes, quantified via integrated water vapor transport, follow robust\\npower-law distributions, displaying finite-size scaling. These scaling\\nbehaviors persist under warming scenarios, suggesting that ARs operate near a\\ncritical state as emergent, self-regulating systems. Concurrently, we observe a\\nsystematic poleward migration and intensification of ARs, linked to\\nthermodynamic amplification and dynamical reorganization. Our findings\\nestablish a statistical physics framework for ARs, linking critical phenomena\\nto the spatiotemporal structure of extreme events in a warming climate.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.geo-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.geo-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T11:55:22Z\"}"}
