{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11425v1\", \"title\": \"MINDS: The very low-mass star and brown dwarf sample -- Hidden water in\\n  carbon-dominated protoplanetary disks\", \"summary\": \"Infrared observations of the inner disks around very low-mass stars (VLMS,\\n$<$0.3$\\\\,M_{\\\\odot}$) have revealed a carbon-rich gas composition in the\\nterrestrial planet-forming regions. Contrary to the typically water-rich T\\nTauri disk spectra, only two disks around VLMS have been observed to be\\nwater-rich among more than ten VLMS disks observed so far with JWST/MIRI. In\\nthis letter, we systematically search for the presence of water and other\\noxygen-bearing molecules in the JWST/MIRI spectra of ten VLMS disks from the\\nMIRI mid-INfrared Disk Survey (MINDS). In addition to the two previously\\nreported detections of water emission in this VLMS sample, we detect water\\nemission in the spectra of three other sources and tentatively in one source,\\nand we provide strong evidence for water emission in the remaining disks in the\\nMINDS sample, most of which have bright emission from carbon-bearing molecules.\\nWe show that the $\\\\rm C_2H_2$ emission is much stronger than that of water for\\nsources with low luminosities, and the hydrocarbons outshine the water emission\\nin such conditions. We propose that the appearance of water-rich vs.\\nhydrocarbon-rich spectra is related to the location of the water reservoir in\\nthe disk relative to the main hydrocarbon reservoir. Our findings indicate that\\nthe terrestrial planet forming regions in VLMS disks have high carbon-to-oxygen\\nratios (C/O$>$1), but can still harbor ample water similar to those in the T\\nTauri disks.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T17:38:14Z\"}"}
