{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11163v1\", \"title\": \"The Robotability Score: Enabling Harmonious Robot Navigation on Urban\\n  Streets\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces the Robotability Score ($R$), a novel metric that\\nquantifies the suitability of urban environments for autonomous robot\\nnavigation. Through expert interviews and surveys, we identify and weigh key\\nfeatures contributing to R for wheeled robots on urban streets. Our findings\\nreveal that pedestrian density, crowd dynamics and pedestrian flow are the most\\ncritical factors, collectively accounting for 28% of the total score. Computing\\nrobotability across New York City yields significant variation; the area of\\nhighest R is 3.0 times more \\\"robotable\\\" than the area of lowest R. Deployments\\nof a physical robot on high and low robotability areas show the adequacy of the\\nscore in anticipating the ease of robot navigation. This new framework for\\nevaluating urban landscapes aims to reduce uncertainty in robot deployment\\nwhile respecting established mobility patterns and urban planning principles,\\ncontributing to the discourse on harmonious human-robot environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T13:11:47Z\"}"}
