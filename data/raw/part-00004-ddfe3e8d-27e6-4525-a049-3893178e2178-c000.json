The initial concept and\\nexploration of these Lie groups were presented in Monatsh. Math. \\\\textbf{176}\\n(2015), 219-239. This paper builds upon the results from the aforementioned\\nstudy by providing a complete description of cyclic Riemannian Lie groups and\\nan in-depth analysis of their various curvatures.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T14:32:20Z\"}"}
