{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12040v1\", \"title\": \"No equivalence between hydrodynamic and dispersive mass of the charged\\n  polaron\", \"summary\": \"We consider the problem of a charged impurity exerting a weak, slowly\\ndecaying force on its surroundings, treating the latter as an ideal\\ncompressible fluid. In the semiclassical approximation, the ion is described by\\nthe Newton equation coupled to the Euler equation for the medium. After\\nlinearization, we obtain a simple closed formula for the effective mass of the\\nimpurity, depending on the interaction potential, the mean medium density, and\\nsound velocity. Thus, once the interaction and the equation of state of the\\nfluid is known, an estimate of the hydrodynamic effective mass can be quickly\\nprovided. Going beyond the classical case, we show that replacing the Newton\\nwith Schr\\\\\\\"{o}dinger equation can drastically change the behavior of the\\nimpurity. In particular, the scaling of the Fermi polaron effective mass with\\nthe medium density is opposite in quantum and classical scenario. Our results\\nare relevant for experimental systems featuring low energy impurities in Fermi\\nor Bose systems, such as ions immersed in neutral atomic gases.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas,physics.flu-dyn,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T12:54:46Z\"}"}
