{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21440v1\", \"title\": \"QuantumToolbox.jl: An efficient Julia framework for simulating open\\n  quantum systems\", \"summary\": \"We present QuantumToolbox.jl, an open-source Julia package for simulating\\nopen quantum systems. Designed with a syntax familiar to users of QuTiP\\n(Quantum Toolbox in Python), it harnesses Julia's high-performance ecosystem to\\ndeliver fast and scalable simulations. The package includes a suite of\\ntime-evolution solvers supporting distributed computing and GPU acceleration,\\nenabling efficient simulation of large-scale quantum systems. We also show how\\nQuantumToolbox.jl can integrate with automatic differentiation tools, making it\\nwell-suited for gradient-based optimization tasks such as quantum optimal\\ncontrol. Benchmark comparisons demonstrate substantial performance gains over\\nexisting frameworks. With its flexible design and computational efficiency,\\nQuantumToolbox.jl serves as a powerful tool for both theoretical studies and\\npractical applications in quantum science.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T08:56:12Z\"}"}
