{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19773v1\", \"title\": \"Sliding Window Adversarial Channels\", \"summary\": \"In an arbitrarily varying channel (AVC), the channel has a state which is\\nunder the control of an adversarial jammer and the corresponding capacities are\\noften functions of the \\\"power\\\" constraints on the transmitter and jammer. In\\nthis paper we propose a model in which the constraints must hold almost surely\\nover contiguous subsequences of the codeword and state, which we call a sliding\\nwindow constraint. We study oblivious jammers and codes with stochastic\\nencoding under maximum probability of error. We show that this extra limitation\\non the jammer is beneficial for the transmitter: in some cases, the capacity\\nfor unique decoding with a sliding window constraint is equal to the capacity\\nfor list decoding in the standard model without sliding windows, roughly\\nimplying that the addition of window constraints reduces list decoding to\\nunique decoding. The list decoding capacity in the standard model can be\\nstrictly larger than the unique decoding capacity.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T13:18:02Z\"}"}
