In this study, we investigate the machine\\nlearnability of additive atomic contributions to the electronic DOS. Our\\napproach focuses on atom-projected DOS rather than structural DOS. This method\\nfor structure-property mapping is both scalable and transferable, achieving\\nhigh prediction accuracy for pure and compound silicon and carbon structures of\\nvarying sizes and configurations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness\\nof our method on the complex Sn-S-Se compound structures. By employing locally\\ntrained DOS, we significantly enhance the accuracy in predicting secondary\\nmaterial properties, such as band energy, Fermi level, heat capacity, and\\nmagnetic susceptibility. Our findings indicate that directly learning atomic\\nDOS, rather than structural DOS, improves the efficiency, accuracy, and\\ninterpretability of machine learning in structure-property mapping. This\\nstreamlined approach reduces computational complexity, paving the way for the\\nexamination of electronic structures in materials without the need for\\ncomputationally expensive ab initio calculations.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.dis-nn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T17:28:53Z\"}"}
