{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05285v1\", \"title\": \"Polaritonic Quantum Matter\", \"summary\": \"Polaritons are quantum mechanical superpositions of photon states with\\nelementary excitations in molecules and solids. The light-matter admixture\\ncauses a characteristic frequency-momentum dispersion shared by all polaritons\\nirrespective of the microscopic nature of material excitations that could\\nentail charge, spin, lattice or orbital effects. Polaritons retain the strong\\nnonlinearities of their matter component and simultaneously inherit ray-like\\npropagation of light. Polaritons prompt new properties, enable new\\nopportunities for spectroscopy/imaging, empower quantum simulations and give\\nrise to new forms of synthetic quantum matter. Here, we review the emergent\\neffects rooted in polaritonic quasiparticles in a wide variety of their\\nphysical implementations. We present a broad portfolio of the physical\\nplatforms and phenomena of what we term polaritonic quantum matter. We discuss\\nthe unifying aspects of polaritons across different platforms and physical\\nimplementations and focus on recent developments in: polaritonic imaging,\\ncavity electrodynamics and cavity materials engineering, topology and\\nnonlinearities, as well as quantum polaritonics.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.optics,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:28:31Z\"}"}
