PASS utilizes dielectric waveguides with freely positioned pinching\\nantennas (PAs) to establish strong line-of-sight links. Capitalizing on this\\nhigh reconfigurable flexibility of antennas, the potential of PASS for covert\\ncommunications is investigated. 1)~For the single-waveguide single-PA (SWSP)\\nscenario, a closed-form optimal PA position that maximizes the covert rate is\\nfirst derived. Subsequently, a one-dimensional power search is employed to\\nenable low-complexity optimization for covert communications. With antenna\\nmobility on a scale of meters, PASS can deal with the challenging situation of\\nthe eavesdropper enjoying better channel conditions than the legal user. 2)~For\\nthe multi-waveguide multi-PA (MWMP) scenario, the positions of multiple PAs are\\noptimized to enable effective pinching beamforming, thereby enhancing the\\ncovert rate. To address the resultant multimodal joint transmit and pinching\\nbeamforming problem, a twin particle swarm optimization (TwinPSO) approach is\\nproposed. Numerical results demonstrate that: i)~the proposed approaches can\\neffectively resolve the optimization problems; ii)~PASS achieves a higher\\ncovert rate than conventional fixed-position antenna architectures; and\\niii)~with enhanced flexibility, the MWMP setup outperforms the SWSP\\ncounterpart.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:32:54Z\"}"}
