{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17677v1\", \"title\": \"INSIGHT: Bridging the Student-Teacher Gap in Times of Large Language\\n  Models\", \"summary\": \"The rise of AI, especially Large Language Models, presents challenges and\\nopportunities to integrate such technology into the classroom. AI has the\\npotential to revolutionize education by helping teaching staff with various\\ntasks, such as personalizing their teaching methods, but it also raises\\nconcerns, for example, about the degradation of student-teacher interactions\\nand user privacy. This paper introduces INSIGHT, a proof of concept to combine\\nvarious AI tools to assist teaching staff and students in the process of\\nsolving exercises. INSIGHT has a modular design that allows it to be integrated\\ninto various higher education courses. We analyze students' questions to an LLM\\nby extracting keywords, which we use to dynamically build an FAQ from students'\\nquestions and provide new insights for the teaching staff to use for more\\npersonalized face-to-face support. Future work could build upon INSIGHT by\\nusing the collected data to provide adaptive learning and adjust content based\\non student progress and learning styles to offer a more interactive and\\ninclusive learning experience.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:47:20Z\"}"}
