Motivated\\nby practical constraints, we also consider a more realistic scenario in which\\nonly a restricted set of Lindbladian generators is available. We study the\\ncorresponding transitivity properties and characterize the set of states that\\ncan be reached using such limited dynamical resources.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,math-ph,math.FA,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T09:48:16Z\"}"}
