Here, we theoretically\\npredict a new type-III Weyl semi-half-metal (SHM) state in monolayer Li$_2$N,\\nuniquely combining magnetic half-metallicity and type-III Weyl semimetal\\ncharacteristics. First-principles calculations reveal a fully spin-polarized\\nand critically tilted Weyl cone around the Fermi level in monolayer Li$_2$N,\\ndriven by $p$-orbital ferromagnetism. This arises from the symmetry-protected\\nband crossing between a flat valence band and a highly dispersive conduction\\nband, leading to type-III Weyl fermions with strong transport anisotropy. A\\nlow-energy $k{\\\\cdot}p$ Hamiltonian is constructed and corresponding nontrivial\\nedge states are uncovered to capture the topological nature of Li$_2$N.\\nNotably, this Weyl SHM phase remains robust under biaxial strain ranging from\\n-2$\\\\%$ to $4\\\\%$, with an ideal type-III Weyl fermion emerging alongside a\\nline-like ergodic surface emerging at 3.7$\\\\%$ strain, offering a promising\\nplatform for exploring correlated electronic phenomena. Our results establish\\nLi$_2$N as a viable candidate for realizing exotic type-III Weyl SHM states and\\nopen a new avenue for exploring the intricate interplay among magnetism,\\ntopology, and flat-band physics.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:28:56Z\"}"}
