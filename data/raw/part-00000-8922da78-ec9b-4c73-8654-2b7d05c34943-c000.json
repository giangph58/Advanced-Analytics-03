Unlike\\nexisting methods, the proposed pricing scheme does not require device-aware\\ncentralized coordination or communication between prosumers. By developing new\\nsufficient conditions under which a stochastic game is a Markov potential game,\\nwe show that the problem of computing an equilibrium for the proposed model is\\nequivalent to solving a single-agent Markov Decision Process. These new\\nconditions are general and may apply to other applications. We compute the\\nequilibrium for an IEEE test system to empirically demonstrate the\\neffectiveness of the pricing policy.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:25:50Z\"}"}
