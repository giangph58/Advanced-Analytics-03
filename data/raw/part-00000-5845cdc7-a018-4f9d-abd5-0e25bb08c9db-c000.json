It is however a very challenging task for both neural and\\nsymbolic approaches. We present the first steps towards a practical\\nneuro-symbolic lemma conjecturing tool, Lemmanaid, that combines Large Language\\nModels (LLMs) and symbolic methods, and evaluate it on proof libraries for the\\nIsabelle proof assistant. We train an LLM to generate lemma templates that\\ndescribe the shape of a lemma, and use symbolic methods to fill in the details.\\nWe compare Lemmanaid against an LLM trained to generate complete lemma\\nstatements as well as previous fully symbolic conjecturing methods. Our results\\nindicate that neural and symbolic techniques are complementary. By leveraging\\nthe best of both symbolic and neural methods we can generate useful lemmas for\\na wide range of input domains, facilitating computer-assisted theory\\ndevelopment and formalization.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:30:36Z\"}"}
