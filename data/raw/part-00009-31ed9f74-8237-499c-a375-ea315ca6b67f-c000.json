With established methods like t-SNE and PCA\\npresenting a trade-off between representational power and interpretability.\\nThis paper introduces a novel approach that bridges this gap by combining the\\ninterpretability of linear methods with the expressiveness of non-linear\\ntransformations. The proposed algorithm constructs a non-linear mapping between\\nhigh-dimensional and low-dimensional spaces through a combination of linear\\ntransformations, each weighted by Gaussian functions. This architecture enables\\ncomplex non-linear transformations while preserving the interpretability\\nadvantages of linear methods, as each transformation can be analyzed\\nindependently. The resulting model provides both powerful dimensionality\\nreduction and transparent insights into the transformed space. Techniques for\\ninterpreting the learned transformations are presented, including methods for\\nidentifying suppressed dimensions and how space is expanded and contracted.\\nThese tools enable practitioners to understand how the algorithm preserves and\\nmodifies geometric relationships during dimensionality reduction. To ensure the\\npractical utility of this algorithm, the creation of user-friendly software\\npackages is emphasized, facilitating its adoption in both academia and\\nindustry.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:26:42Z\"}"}
