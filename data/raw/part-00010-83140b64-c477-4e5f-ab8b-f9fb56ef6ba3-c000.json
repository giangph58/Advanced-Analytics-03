{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07574v1\", \"title\": \"Malware analysis assisted by AI with R2AI\", \"summary\": \"This research studies the quality, speed and cost of malware analysis\\nassisted by artificial intelligence. It focuses on Linux and IoT malware of\\n2024-2025, and uses r2ai, the AI extension of Radare2's disassembler. Not all\\nmalware and not all LLMs are equivalent but the study shows excellent results\\nwith Claude 3.5 and 3.7 Sonnet. Despite a few errors, the quality of analysis\\nis overall equal or better than without AI assistance. For good results, the AI\\ncannot operate alone and must constantly be guided by an experienced analyst.\\nThe gain of speed is largely visible with AI assistance, even when taking\\naccount the time to understand AI's hallucinations, exaggerations and\\nomissions. The cost is usually noticeably lower than the salary of a malware\\nanalyst, but attention and guidance is needed to keep it under control in cases\\nwhere the AI would naturally loop without showing progress.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T09:17:45Z\"}"}
