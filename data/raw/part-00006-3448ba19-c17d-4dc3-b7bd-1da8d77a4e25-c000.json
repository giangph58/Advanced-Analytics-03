Inspired by workflows using\\nsplines in computer animation, our Spline-based Transformers embed an input\\nsequence of elements as a smooth trajectory in latent space. Overcoming\\ndrawbacks of positional encoding such as sequence length extrapolation,\\nSpline-based Transformers also provide a novel way for users to interact with\\ntransformer latent spaces by directly manipulating the latent control points to\\ncreate new latent trajectories and sequences. We demonstrate the superior\\nperformance of our approach in comparison to conventional positional encoding\\non a variety of datasets, ranging from synthetic 2D to large-scale real-world\\ndatasets of images, 3D shapes, and animations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T17:42:07Z\"}"}
