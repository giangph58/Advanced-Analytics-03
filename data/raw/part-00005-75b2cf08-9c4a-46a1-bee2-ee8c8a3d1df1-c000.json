{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03464v1\", \"title\": \"Barrier induced stalemate-consensus transition of self-propelled\\n  participants subject to majority rule\", \"summary\": \"Natural or artificial barriers, such as the Himalayas, the Berlin Wall, or\\nthe Korean Demilitarized Zone, can significantly impede human migration. As a\\nconsequence, they may also hinder the dissemination of opinions within society,\\nthereby contributing to divergent geopolitical landscapes and cultural\\ndevelopments. This raises a fundamental question: how do such barriers\\ninfluence the opinion dynamics of mobile agents, such as human beings? In\\nparticular, can a barrier induce transitions in collective opinion states among\\nspatially segregated groups? Here, we investigate the opinion dynamics governed\\nby majority rule in a minimal model comprising self-propelled agents with\\nbinary opinions performing random walks within a closed space divided by a\\nbarrier. We focus on the conditions under which initially segregated clusters\\nof agents with opposing opinions can reach consensus. Our results reveal the\\nexistence of a critical barrier size that marks a transition between stalemate\\nand consensus states. Near this critical point, the relaxation time to reach\\nconsensus from an initial stalemate exhibits a power-law divergence. This\\nbarrier-induced stalemate-consensus transition in a simple agent-based model\\noffers new insights into the role of physical or social barriers in shaping\\nopinion dynamics and social structures.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph,cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T12:05:39Z\"}"}
