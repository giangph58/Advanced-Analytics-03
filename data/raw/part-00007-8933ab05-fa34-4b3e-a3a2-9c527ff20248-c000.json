{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00430v1\", \"title\": \"Over-the-Air Inference over Multi-hop MIMO Networks\", \"summary\": \"A novel over-the-air machine learning framework over multi-hop multiple-input\\nand multiple-output (MIMO) networks is proposed. The core idea is to imitate\\nfully connected (FC) neural network layers using multiple MIMO channels by\\ncarefully designing the precoding matrices at the transmitting nodes. A neural\\nnetwork dubbed PrototypeNet is employed consisting of multiple FC layers, with\\nthe number of neurons of each layer equal to the number of antennas of the\\ncorresponding terminal. To achieve satisfactory performance, we train\\nPrototypeNet based on a customized loss function consisting of classification\\nerror and the power of latent vectors to satisfy transmit power constraints,\\nwith noise injection during training. Precoding matrices for each hop are then\\nobtained by solving an optimization problem. We also propose a multiple-block\\nextension when the number of antennas is limited. Numerical results verify that\\nthe proposed over-the-air transmission scheme can achieve satisfactory\\nclassification accuracy under a power constraint. The results also show that\\nhigher classification accuracy can be achieved with an increasing number of\\nhops at a modest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T09:59:32Z\"}"}
