{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07066v1\", \"title\": \"Intertwining Josephson and Vortex Topologies in Conventional\\n  Superconductors\", \"summary\": \"Recent experimental advances have unveiled promising evidence of vortex-bound\\nMajorana quasiparticles in multiple superconducting compounds. However,\\ntheoretical progress in understanding these phenomena, especially from ab\\ninitio approaches, has been limited by the computational complexity of\\nsimulating vortex structures. To bridge this gap, we introduce the\\nJosephson-vortex correspondence (JVC), a theoretical framework that\\nsystematically maps the bound-state topological properties of vortices to those\\nof $\\\\pi$-phase Josephson junctions in the same superconductor. This\\ncorrespondence allows vortex phase diagrams to be constructed directly from\\njunction calculations, thereby eliminating the need for large-scale vortex\\ncalculations. We demonstrate the validity and predictive power of JVC across a\\nvariety of effective models, and further extend the framework to the\\nfirst-principles level. Applying our approach to 2M-WS$_2$ and Sr$_3$SnO, we\\nidentify them as realistic, doping-tunable platforms for realizing vortex\\nMajorana zero modes. Our theory will pave the way for ab initio Majorana\\nmaterial discovery and design.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T17:31:34Z\"}"}
