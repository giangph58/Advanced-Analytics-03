{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12023v1\", \"title\": \"Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning for Interpretable Decision-Making in\\n  Supply Chain Management\", \"summary\": \"In the context of Industry 4.0, Supply Chain Management (SCM) faces\\nchallenges in adopting advanced optimization techniques due to the \\\"black-box\\\"\\nnature of most AI-based solutions, which causes reluctance among company\\nstakeholders. To overcome this issue, in this work, we employ an Interpretable\\nArtificial Intelligence (IAI) approach that combines evolutionary computation\\nwith Reinforcement Learning (RL) to generate interpretable decision-making\\npolicies in the form of decision trees. This IAI solution is embedded within a\\nsimulation-based optimization framework specifically designed to handle the\\ninherent uncertainties and stochastic behaviors of modern supply chains. To our\\nknowledge, this marks the first attempt to combine IAI with simulation-based\\noptimization for decision-making in SCM. The methodology is tested on two\\nsupply chain optimization problems, one fictional and one from the real world,\\nand its performance is compared against widely used optimization and RL\\nalgorithms. The results reveal that the interpretable approach delivers\\ncompetitive, and sometimes better, performance, challenging the prevailing\\nnotion that there must be a trade-off between interpretability and optimization\\nefficiency. Additionally, the developed framework demonstrates strong potential\\nfor industrial applications, offering seamless integration with various\\nPython-based algorithms.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NE\", \"categories\": \"cs.NE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T12:28:35Z\"}"}
