In this paper it is shown that a\\ncomponent of a dynamical affine connection, which is independent of the metric,\\ncan easily drive inflation in agreement with these observations. Such\\ngeometrical explanation of inflation is analysed in detail here in the minimal\\nmodel, including the predictions for the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and its\\nrunning $\\\\alpha_s$, the amplitude of the scalar perturbations and the\\ntensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. Furthermore, this minimal model is shown to provide\\nan inflationary attractor: arbitrary initial values of the kinetic energy\\ndensity are dynamically attracted down to negligible values compared to the\\npotential energy density in homogeneous and isotropic metrics. The role of the\\nHiggs boson during and after inflation is also briefly discussed.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:59:59Z\"}"}
