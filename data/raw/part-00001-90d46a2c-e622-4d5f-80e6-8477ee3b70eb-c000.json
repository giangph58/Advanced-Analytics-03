We construct and analyse two general\\nfamilies of dephasing prescriptions with extensions to eccentric sources, as\\nwell as collect five specific prescriptions for the fundamental smoking gun\\nphysical mechanisms at play in the dynamical and AGN formation channel for\\nstellar mass binary black holes: Roemer delays, tidal forces and hydrodynamical\\ninteractions. We compute the expected fraction of signals containing\\nastrophysical dephasing, as a function of environmental properties and based on\\nobserved distributions of binary parameters. We find that next generation\\ndetectors can expect to find environmental effects in hundreds of detected\\nsignals.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.GA,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:37:04Z\"}"}
