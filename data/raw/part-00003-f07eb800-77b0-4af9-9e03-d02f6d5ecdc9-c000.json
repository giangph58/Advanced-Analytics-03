{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05127v1\", \"title\": \"Quantum Acoustics with Superconducting Qubits in the Multimode\\n  Transition-Coupling Regime\", \"summary\": \"Hybrid mechanical-superconducting systems for quantum information processing\\nhave attracted significant attention due to their potential applications. In\\nsuch systems, the weak coupling regime, dominated by dissipation, has been\\nextensively studied. The strong coupling regime, where coherent energy exchange\\nexceeds losses, has also been widely explored. However, the transition-coupling\\nregime, which lies between the above two and exhibits rich, unique physics,\\nremains underexplored. In this study, we fabricate a tunable coupling device to\\ninvestigate the coupling of a superconducting transmon qubit to a seven-mode\\nsurface acoustic wave resonator (SAWR), with a particular focus on the\\ntransition-coupling regime. Through a series of phonon oscillation experiments\\nand studies in the dispersive regime, we systematically characterize the\\nperformance of the SAWR. We then explore the complex dynamics of energy\\nexchange between the qubit and the mechanical modes, highlighting the interplay\\nbetween dissipation and coherence. Finally, we propose a protocol for qubit\\nreadout and fast reset with a multimode mechanical cavity using one mode for\\nreadout and another mode for reset. We have demonstrated in simulation that the\\nqubit achieves both fast reset and high coherence performance when the qubit is\\ncoupled to the reset mode in the transition-coupling regime.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T10:57:42Z\"}"}
