Our main goal is to rigorously\\ndemonstrate that the empirical measure associated with the particle system\\nconverges uniformly, both in time and space, to the solution of the three\\ndimensional Navier Stokes alpha model with advection noise. This convergence\\nestablishes a probabilistic framework for deriving macroscopic stochastic fluid\\nequations from underlying microscopic dynamics. The analysis leverages\\nsemigroup techniques to address the nonlinear structure of the limiting\\nequations, and we provide a detailed treatment of the well posedness of the\\nlimiting stochastic partial differential equation. This ensures that the\\nparticle approximation remains stable and controlled over time. Although\\nsimilar convergence results have been obtained in two dimensional settings, our\\nstudy presents the first proof of strong uniform convergence in three\\ndimensions for a stochastic fluid model derived from an interacting particle\\nsystem. Importantly, our results also yield new insights in the deterministic\\nregime, namely, in the absence of advection noise, where this type of\\nconvergence had not been previously established.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T14:06:33Z\"}"}
