{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17423v1\", \"title\": \"RIS-Assisted Noncoherent Wireless System: Error Analysis with Optimal\\n  Receiver and Multi-level ASK\", \"summary\": \"This paper considers a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided\\nwireless communication system where the transmitter employs one-sided\\namplitude-shift keying (ASK) for data modulation and the receiver employs an\\noptimal noncoherent maximum-likelihood rule for symbol detection. A novel\\nstatistical analysis is presented to approximate the weighted sum of a central\\nand a non-central chi-squared random variable, which is used to derive a novel\\nclosed-form expression for the symbol error probability (SEP) of the\\nnoncoherent system. Furthermore, an optimization problem to minimize the\\nsystem's SEP under transmission energy constraint is proposed, and novel\\nalgorithms are presented to obtain the optimal ASK constellation minimizing the\\nSEP. Numerical results indicate that the noncoherent system achieves superior\\nerror performance and higher diversity order with the optimal ASK constellation\\ncompared to the traditional equispaced ASK constellation. Further, the optimal\\nASK significantly differs from the traditional one, with the difference\\nbecoming significant with an increase in the average signal-to-noise ratio and\\nat a lower number of RIS's reflecting elements.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T10:25:19Z\"}"}
