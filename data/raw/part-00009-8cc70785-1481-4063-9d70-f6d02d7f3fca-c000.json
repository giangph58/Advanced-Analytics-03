{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00332v1\", \"title\": \"Active Contact Engagement for Aerial Navigation in Unknown Environments\\n  with Glass\", \"summary\": \"Autonomous aerial robots are increasingly being deployed in real-world\\nscenarios, where transparent glass obstacles present significant challenges to\\nreliable navigation. Researchers have investigated the use of non-contact\\nsensors and passive contact-resilient aerial vehicle designs to detect glass\\nsurfaces, which are often limited in terms of robustness and efficiency. In\\nthis work, we propose a novel approach for robust autonomous aerial navigation\\nin unknown environments with transparent glass obstacles, combining the\\nstrengths of both sensor-based and contact-based glass detection. The proposed\\nsystem begins with the incremental detection and information maintenance about\\npotential glass surfaces using visual sensor measurements. The vehicle then\\nactively engages in touch actions with the visually detected potential glass\\nsurfaces using a pair of lightweight contact-sensing modules to confirm or\\ninvalidate their presence. Following this, the volumetric map is efficiently\\nupdated with the glass surface information and safe trajectories are replanned\\non the fly to circumvent the glass obstacles. We validate the proposed system\\nthrough real-world experiments in various scenarios, demonstrating its\\neffectiveness in enabling efficient and robust autonomous aerial navigation in\\ncomplex real-world environments with glass obstacles.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T06:14:53Z\"}"}
