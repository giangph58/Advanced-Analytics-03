It naturally acts on the space dual to the Lie algebra n of N, and this\\naction is called coadjoint. Such orbits play the key role in the orbit method\\nof A.A. Kirillov. In this work, we classify the orbits of this action in the\\ncase of {\\\\Phi} = F_4 in terms of supports of canonical forms. This means that\\nwe will present a set S of linear forms such that for any coadjoint orbit there\\nexists a unique form from S belonging to that orbit. The set of canonical forms\\nwill be explicitly described in terms of supports.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RT\", \"categories\": \"math.RT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T11:56:38Z\"}"}
