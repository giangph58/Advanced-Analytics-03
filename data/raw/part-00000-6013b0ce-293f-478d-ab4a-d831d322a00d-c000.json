{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00497v1\", \"title\": \"KeySync: A Robust Approach for Leakage-free Lip Synchronization in High\\n  Resolution\", \"summary\": \"Lip synchronization, known as the task of aligning lip movements in an\\nexisting video with new input audio, is typically framed as a simpler variant\\nof audio-driven facial animation. However, as well as suffering from the usual\\nissues in talking head generation (e.g., temporal consistency), lip\\nsynchronization presents significant new challenges such as expression leakage\\nfrom the input video and facial occlusions, which can severely impact\\nreal-world applications like automated dubbing, but are often neglected in\\nexisting works. To address these shortcomings, we present KeySync, a two-stage\\nframework that succeeds in solving the issue of temporal consistency, while\\nalso incorporating solutions for leakage and occlusions using a carefully\\ndesigned masking strategy. We show that KeySync achieves state-of-the-art\\nresults in lip reconstruction and cross-synchronization, improving visual\\nquality and reducing expression leakage according to LipLeak, our novel leakage\\nmetric. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our new masking\\napproach in handling occlusions and validate our architectural choices through\\nseveral ablation studies.
