{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12834v1\", \"title\": \"Hunting for newborn magnetars: a multi-messenger approach\", \"summary\": \"We carry out a numerical calculation of magnetar-powered shock break-outs\\n(SBOs) and supernova (SN) light-curves. In particular, we investigate the\\nimpact of gravitational wave (GW) emission by the magnetar central engine on\\nits electromagnetic (EM) counterparts in the ULTRASAT band. Our results show\\nthat GW emission by the magnetar has only a minor effect on the SBO\\nlight-curve. However, we find that SN light-curves can carry a direct signature\\nof GW emission, which becomes more evident at late times (> 20-30 days).~Our\\nresults demonstrate that future ULTRASAT observations will provide crucial\\ninsights into the magnetar formation process, and unique information for direct\\nsearches of long-transient signals with current and future generation GW\\ndetectors. In particular, we estimate a rate of multi-messenger (UV+GW)\\ndetections of newly formed magnetars $>$ 1 every two years with ULTRASAT and\\nthe Einstein Telescope.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T10:49:10Z\"}"}
