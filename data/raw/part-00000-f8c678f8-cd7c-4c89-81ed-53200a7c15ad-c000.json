This notion was originally\\nintroduced by Boltje, Danz and K\\\\\\\"{u}lshammer in 2011, and it has been the\\nsubject of numerous papers in recent years. In this paper, we study the depth\\nof core-free subgroups, which allows us to apply powerful computational and\\nprobabilistic techniques that were originally designed for studying bases for\\npermutation groups. We use these methods to prove a wide range of new results\\non the depth of subgroups of almost simple groups, significantly extending the\\nscope of earlier work in this direction. For example, we establish best\\npossible bounds on the depth of irreducible subgroups of classical groups and\\nprimitive subgroups of symmetric groups. And with the exception of a handful of\\nopen cases involving the Baby Monster, we calculate the exact depth of every\\nsubgroup of every almost simple sporadic group. We also present a number of\\nopen problems and conjectures.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GR\", \"categories\": \"math.GR,math.RT\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T08:46:46Z\"}"}
