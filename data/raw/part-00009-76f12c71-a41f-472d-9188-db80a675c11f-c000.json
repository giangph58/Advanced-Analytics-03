In this paper, we provide\\nan explicit calculation in this model with the help of the Wigner-like\\nparametrization, working in the flavor basis that both the Dirac and Majorana\\nmass matrices are chosen to be diagonal. Physical observables can be exactly\\ncalculated without any approximation, where three light Majorana neutrino\\nmasses $m_i^{}$, leptonic mixing angles $\\\\theta_{ij}^{}$, CP-violating phases\\n$\\\\{\\\\delta,\\\\rho,\\\\sigma\\\\}$, and three rotation angles $\\\\vartheta_i^{}$ describing\\nthe hierarchy between electroweak and seesaw scales are chosen as input\\nparameters. For demonstration, we evaluate the branching fractions of the\\nlepton-flavor-violating decays of charged leptons and the CP-violating\\nasymmetries in the resonant thermal leptogenesis. The model parameters are\\nconstrained by the latest experimental limits.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:28:52Z\"}"}
