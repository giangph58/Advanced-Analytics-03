Here we study the stability required in order to measure this\\npolarisation dependence in a head-on collision between a high-power linearly\\npolarised laser and a relativistic electron beam, where the $\\\\gamma$-rays\\nproduced via nonlinear Compton scattering are highly polarised. We find that\\nthe laser strength parameter $a_0$ has to be known to within a few per cent,\\nand that the alignment of the laser and electron beam cannot fluctuate by more\\nthan half the spot size, in order to attribute the reduction in positron yield\\nto polarisation effects. These collision parameters are difficult to achieve,\\nbut may be realised in future precision experiments that focus on beam\\nstability.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T13:42:55Z\"}"}
