Nevertheless, recent studies on\\nneural OT methods predominantly focused on the efficient computation of a\\nsingle map between two distributions. To address this challenge, we introduce a\\nnovel approach to learning transport maps for new empirical distributions.\\nSpecifically, we employ the transformer architecture to produce embeddings from\\ndistributional data of varying length; these embeddings are then fed into a\\nhypernetwork to generate neural OT maps. Various numerical experiments were\\nconducted to validate the embeddings and the generated OT maps. The model\\nimplementation and the code are provided on\\nhttps://github.com/jiangmingchen/HOTET.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T16:52:48Z\"}"}
