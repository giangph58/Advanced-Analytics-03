In an\\nelementary WAMS, two identical phasors measured at two different locations have\\ndifference in the phase angles measured since their reference waveforms are not\\nsynchronized with each other. Phasor measurement units (PMUs) measure input\\nphasors with respect to a common reference wave based on the atomic clock\\npulses received from global positioning system (GPS) satellites, eliminating\\nvariation in the measured phase angles due to distant locations of the\\nmeasurement nodes. This has found tremendous applications in quick fault\\ndetection, fault location analysis, accurate current, voltage, frequency and\\nphase angle measurements in WAMS. Commercially available PMU models are often\\nproven to be expensive for research and development as well as for grid\\nintegration projects. This research article proposes an economic PMU model\\noptimized for accurate steadystate performance based on recursive discrete\\nFourier transform (DFT) and provides results and detailed analysis of the\\nproposed PMU model as per the steady state compliance specifications of IEEE\\nstandard C37.118.1. Results accurate up to 13 digits after decimal point are\\nobtained through the developed PMU model for both nominal and off-nominal\\nfrequency inputs in steady state.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP,cs.SY,eess.SY,physics.soc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T05:13:34Z\"}"}
