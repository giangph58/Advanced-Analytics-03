The results imply that the extended Medicaid eligibility of\\nchildren leads to positive labor supply responses at the extensive and\\nintensive margins of single mothers and to negative labor supply responses at\\nthe extensive margin of married mothers. The analysis of mechanisms suggests\\nthat extended children's Medicaid eligibility positively affects take-up of\\nMedicaid and health of children.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T13:32:57Z\"}"}
