{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11754v1\", \"title\": \"GrabS: Generative Embodied Agent for 3D Object Segmentation without\\n  Scene Supervision\", \"summary\": \"We study the hard problem of 3D object segmentation in complex point clouds\\nwithout requiring human labels of 3D scenes for supervision. By relying on the\\nsimilarity of pretrained 2D features or external signals such as motion to\\ngroup 3D points as objects, existing unsupervised methods are usually limited\\nto identifying simple objects like cars or their segmented objects are often\\ninferior due to the lack of objectness in pretrained features. In this paper,\\nwe propose a new two-stage pipeline called GrabS. The core concept of our\\nmethod is to learn generative and discriminative object-centric priors as a\\nfoundation from object datasets in the first stage, and then design an embodied\\nagent to learn to discover multiple objects by querying against the pretrained\\ngenerative priors in the second stage. We extensively evaluate our method on\\ntwo real-world datasets and a newly created synthetic dataset, demonstrating\\nremarkable segmentation performance, clearly surpassing all existing\\nunsupervised methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI,cs.LG,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T04:13:53Z\"}"}
