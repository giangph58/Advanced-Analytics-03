Specifically: for any positive integer $k$, every $n$-node,\\n$K_h$-minor-free graph has a $(2k-1)$-spanner with sparsity\\n\\\\[O\\\\left(h^{\\\\frac{2}{k+1}} \\\\cdot \\\\text{polylog } h\\\\right),\\\\] and a\\n$(1+\\\\epsilon)(2k-1)$-spanner with lightness\\n\\\\[O_{\\\\epsilon}\\\\left(h^{\\\\frac{2}{k+1}} \\\\cdot \\\\text{polylog } h \\\\right).\\\\] We\\nfurther prove that this exponent $\\\\frac{2}{k+1}$ is best possible, assuming the\\ngirth conjecture. At a technical level, our proofs leverage the recent\\nimprovements by Postle (2020) to the remarkable density increment theorem for\\nminor-free graphs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T07:22:24Z\"}"}
