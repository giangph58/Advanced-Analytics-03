The scheme is designed to handle $L^1$\\nkernels with singularities by relying solely on integrated kernel quantities,\\nand it preserves the non-decreasing property of the integrated process. We\\nestablish weak convergence of the iVi scheme by reformulating it as a\\nstochastic Volterra equation with a measure kernel and proving a stability\\nresult for this class of equations. Numerical results demonstrate that\\nconvergence is achieved with very few time steps. Remarkably, for the rough\\nfractional kernel, unlike existing schemes, convergence seems to improve as the\\nHurst index $H$ decreases and approaches $-1/2$.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.MF\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.MF,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:17:37Z\"}"}
