{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06637v1\", \"title\": \"SCI-Reason: A Dataset with Chain-of-Thought Rationales for Complex\\n  Multimodal Reasoning in Academic Areas\", \"summary\": \"Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) demonstrate\\nimpressive problem-solving skills in many tasks and domains. However, their\\nability to reason with complex images in academic domains has not been\\nsystematically investigated. To bridge this gap, we present SCI-Reason, a\\ndataset for complex multimodel reasoning in academic areas. SCI-Reason aims to\\ntest and improve the reasoning ability of large multimodal models using real\\ncomplex images in academic domains. The dataset contains 12,066 images and\\n12,626 question-answer pairs extracted from PubMed, divided into training,\\nvalidation and test splits. Each question-answer pair also contains an accurate\\nand efficient inference chain as a guide to improving the inference properties\\nof the dataset. With SCI-Reason, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of 8\\nwell-known models. The best performing model, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, only achieved\\nan accuracy of 55.19%. Error analysis shows that more than half of the model\\nfailures are due to breakdowns in multi-step inference chains rather than\\nerrors in primary visual feature extraction. This finding underscores the\\ninherent limitations in reasoning capabilities exhibited by current multimodal\\nmodels when processing complex image analysis tasks within authentic academic\\ncontexts. Experiments on open-source models show that SCI-Reason not only\\nenhances reasoning ability but also demonstrates cross-domain generalization in\\nVQA tasks. We also explore future applications of model inference capabilities\\nin this domain, highlighting its potential for future research.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MM\", \"categories\": \"cs.MM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T07:26:24Z\"}"}
