{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03437v1\", \"title\": \"Thermal properties of zero sound in asymmetric nuclear matter\", \"summary\": \"The zero-sound modes at finite temperature are investigated with the\\nrelativistic random phase approximation to signal the uncertainty of the\\nequation of state (EOS) of asymmetric nuclear matter. It is observed that in\\ntypically selected stiff and soft relativistic mean-field (RMF) models,\\nzero-sound modes arise at low temperature, whereas increasing the temperature\\ngradually breaks the zero sound in soft models, with a smaller density range\\ncompared to stiff models. At high density, the presence or absence of zero\\nsound turns out to be correspondingly the character of the stiff or soft RMF\\nEOS. More strikingly, we find by analyzing the dispersion relation and sound\\nvelocity that at finite temperature the zero-sound modes in RMF models with the\\nstiff EOS undergo a thermal bifurcation, resulting in the transform of zero\\nsound into the first sound at some momentum $Q>T$. The thermally bifurcated\\nsound branch in the stiff models and the zero-sound branch in the soft models\\nare both highly sensitive to the slope of the symmetry energy, providing\\npromising signals for the pending high-density symmetry energies. In addition,\\nit is found that there exists a nonlinear dispersion relation for both the\\nstiff and soft models that supports the zero sound in the relatively lower\\ndensity region.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T11:23:00Z\"}"}
