While stellar evolution imposes\\nan upper mass limit of about 50 solar mass for black holes, some observed\\nmergers--most notably GW190521--involve significantly more massive components,\\nsuggesting alternative formation channels. Here we investigate how heavy black\\nholes merging within Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) disks can become. Using a\\ncomprehensive semi-analytic model incorporating 27 binary and environmental\\nparameters, we explore the role of AGN disk conditions in shaping the upper end\\nof the black hole mass spectrum. We find that AGN disk lifetime is the dominant\\nfactor, with high-mass mergers (>200 solar mass) only possible if disks persist\\nfor ~40 Myr. The joint electromagnetic observation of an AGN-assisted merger\\ncould therefore lead to a direct measurement of the age of an AGN disk.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T08:29:45Z\"}"}
