One major cause factoring\\ninto this circumstance is high development uncertainty that manufacturers face\\nwhen deploying these systems in an open context. In particular, one challenge\\nis establishing a valid argument at design time that the vehicle will exhibit\\nreasonable residual risk when operating in its intended operational design\\ndomain. Regulations, such as the European Implementing Regulation 2022/1426,\\nrequire manufacturers to provide a safety assurance argumentation for\\nSAE-Level-4 automated vehicles. While there is extensive literature on\\nassurance cases for safety-critical systems, the domain of automated driving\\nlacks explicit requirements regarding the creation of safety assurance\\nargumentations. In this paper, we aim to narrow this gap by elaborating a\\nrequirement-based approach. We derive structural requirements for an\\nargumentation from literature and supplement these with requirements derived\\nfrom stakeholder concerns. We implement the requirements, yielding a proposal\\nfor an overall argumentation structure. The resulting \\\"safety arguments\\\" argue\\nover four topic complexes: The developed product, the underlying process\\nincluding its conformance/compliance to standards/laws, as well as the\\nargumentations' context and soundness. Finally, we instantiate this structure\\nwith respect to domain-specific needs and principles.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T17:28:30Z\"}"}
