{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14974v1\", \"title\": \"Nonreciprocal photon blockade induced by parametric amplification in an\\n  asymmetrical cavity\", \"summary\": \"We propose a scheme to generate and manipulate nonreciprocal photon blockade\\neffect in an asymmetrical Fabry-P\\\\'{e}rot cavity, which consists of a single\\ntwo-level atom and a second-order nonlinear medium. By utilizing the intrinsic\\nspatial asymmetry of cavity and applying a parametric amplification pumping\\nlaser to the nonlinear medium, we can realize direction-dependent single-photon\\nand two-photon blockade effects. For nonreciprocal single-photon blockade, our\\nproposal is robust across a wide range of parameters, such as the cavity or\\natomic detuning, coupling strength, and atomic decay. Within similar parameter\\nranges, nonreciprocal two-photon blockade can be achieved and modulated by\\nfinely adjusting the parametric amplification pumping. Our project offers a\\nfeasible access to generating high-quality and tunable nonreciprocal\\nsingle/two-photon source and paves a new avenue for investigating the\\nnonreciprocity of photon quantum statistical properties.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T09:00:37Z\"}"}
