{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12273v1\", \"title\": \"Beyond Reconstruction: A Physics Based Neural Deferred Shader for\\n  Photo-realistic Rendering\", \"summary\": \"Deep learning based rendering has demonstrated major improvements for\\nphoto-realistic image synthesis, applicable to various applications including\\nvisual effects in movies and photo-realistic scene building in video games.\\nHowever, a significant limitation is the difficulty of decomposing the\\nillumination and material parameters, which limits such methods to reconstruct\\nan input scene, without any possibility to control these parameters. This paper\\nintroduces a novel physics based neural deferred shading pipeline to decompose\\nthe data-driven rendering process, learn a generalizable shading function to\\nproduce photo-realistic results for shading and relighting tasks, we also\\nprovide a shadow estimator to efficiently mimic shadowing effect. Our model\\nachieves improved performance compared to classical models and a state-of-art\\nneural shading model, and enables generalizable photo-realistic shading from\\narbitrary illumination input.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T17:32:50Z\"}"}
