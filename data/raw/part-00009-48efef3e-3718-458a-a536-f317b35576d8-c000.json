In this work, we\\nconduct refined non-asymptotic analyses of average-reward MDPs, obtaining a\\ncollection of convergence results that advance our understanding of the setup.\\nAmong our new results, most notable are the $\\\\mathcal{O}(1/k)$-rates of\\nAnchored Value Iteration on the Bellman error under the multichain setup and\\nthe span-based complexity lower bound that matches the $\\\\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ upper\\nbound up to a constant factor of $8$ in the weakly communicating and unichain\\nsetups\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T06:22:14Z\"}"}
