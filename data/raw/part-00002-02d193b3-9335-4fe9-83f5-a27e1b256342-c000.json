{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11982v1\", \"title\": \"Efficient identification of linear, parameter-varying, and nonlinear\\n  systems with noise models\", \"summary\": \"We present a general system identification procedure capable of estimating of\\na broad spectrum of state-space dynamical models, including linear\\ntime-invariant (LTI), linear parameter-varying} (LPV), and nonlinear (NL)\\ndynamics, along with rather general classes of noise models. Similar to the LTI\\ncase, we show that for this general class of model structures, including the NL\\ncase, the model dynamics can be separated into a deterministic process and a\\nstochastic noise part, allowing to seamlessly tune the complexity of the\\ncombined model both in terms of nonlinearity and noise modeling. We\\nparameterize the involved nonlinear functional relations by means of artificial\\nneural-networks (ANNs), although alternative parametric nonlinear mappings can\\nalso be used. To estimate the resulting model structures, we optimize a\\nprediction-error-based criterion using an efficient combination of a\\nconstrained quasi-Newton approach and automatic differentiation, achieving\\ntraining times in the order of seconds compared to existing state-of-the-art\\nANN methods which may require hours for models of similar complexity. We\\nformally establish the consistency guarantees for the proposed approach and\\ndemonstrate its superior estimation accuracy and computational efficiency on\\nseveral benchmark LTI, LPV, and NL system identification problems.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.LG,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T11:23:30Z\"}"}
