{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03678v1\", \"title\": \"Graph Drawing for LLMs: An Empirical Evaluation\", \"summary\": \"Our work contributes to the fast-growing literature on the use of Large\\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to perform graph-related tasks. In particular, we focus\\non usage scenarios that rely on the visual modality, feeding the model with a\\ndrawing of the graph under analysis. We investigate how the model's performance\\nis affected by the chosen layout paradigm, the aesthetics of the drawing, and\\nthe prompting technique used for the queries. We formulate three corresponding\\nresearch questions and present the results of a thorough experimental analysis.\\nOur findings reveal that choosing the right layout paradigm and optimizing the\\nreadability of the input drawing from a human perspective can significantly\\nimprove the performance of the model on the given task. Moreover, selecting the\\nmost effective prompting technique is a challenging yet crucial task for\\nachieving optimal performance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T16:23:42Z\"}"}
