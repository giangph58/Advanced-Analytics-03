The system consists of the generalized\\nNavier-Stokes equations coupled with a convection-diffusion equation describing\\nthe evolution of chemical concentration. This model arises from the\\nmathematical description of the behavior of synovial fluid in the cavities of\\narticulating joints. We prove the existence of a local-in-time strong solution\\nin a three-dimensional spatially periodic domain, assuming that $\\\\frac{7}{5} <\\np^- \\\\le p(\\\\cdot) \\\\le p^+ \\\\le 2$, where $p(\\\\cdot)$ denotes the variable\\npower-law index and $p^-$ and $p^+$ are its lower and upper bounds,\\nrespectively. Furthermore, we prove the uniqueness of the solution under the\\nadditional condition $p^+ < \\\\frac{28}{15}$. In particular, our\\nthree-dimensional analysis directly implies the existence and uniqueness of\\nsolutions in the two-dimensional case under the less restrictive condition $1 <\\np^- \\\\le p(\\\\cdot) \\\\le p^+ \\\\le 2$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T11:49:14Z\"}"}
