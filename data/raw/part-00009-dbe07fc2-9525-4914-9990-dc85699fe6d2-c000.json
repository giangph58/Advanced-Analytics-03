{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11312v1\", \"title\": \"Boundedness and compactness of Bergman projection commutators in\\n  two-weight setting\", \"summary\": \"The goal of this paper is to study the boundedness and compactness of the\\nBergman projection commutators in two weighted settings via the weighted BMO\\nand VMO spaces, respectively. The novelty of our work lies in the distinct\\ntreatment of the symbol b in the commutator, depending on whether it is\\nanalytic or not, which turns out to be quite different. In particular, we show\\nthat an additional weight condition due to Aleman, Pott, and Reguera is\\nnecessary to study the commutators when b is not analytic, while it can be\\nrelaxed when b is analytic. In the analytic setting, we completely characterize\\nboundedness and compactness, while in the non-analytic setting, we provide a\\nsufficient condition which generalizes the Euclidean case and is also necessary\\nin many cases of interest. Our work initiates a study of the commutators acting\\non complex function spaces with different symbols.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CA\", \"categories\": \"math.CA,math.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:52:36Z\"}"}
