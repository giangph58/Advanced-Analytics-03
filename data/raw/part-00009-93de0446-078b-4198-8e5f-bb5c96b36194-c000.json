Using the definition by the ratio of the Weyl curvature\\nscalar and the Kretschmann scalar as the entropy measure, we evaluate the\\ngravitational entropy on the outer and inner horizons. We derive an expression\\nfor the curvature tensor of the Hayward black hole that is as independent as\\npossible of the parameter added to the black hole and give an equation for the\\nentropy measure explicitly independent of that parameter. The gravitational\\nentropy density used in previous studies presents questions from the standpoint\\nof mathematical rigor while we discuss possible improvements in its definition.\\nWe compare the results for the Hayward black hole with the analysis for the\\nReisner-Nordst\\\\\\\"{o}m black hole and discuss the effect of singularity\\nresolution on gravitational entropy.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T05:53:40Z\"}"}
