This work introduces a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework\\nfor visual servoing tasks on SCAs with zero-shot sim-to-real transfer\\ncapabilities, demonstrated on a single section pneumatic manipulator capable of\\nbending and twisting. The framework decouples kinematics from mechanical\\nproperties using an RL kinematic controller for motion planning and a local\\ncontroller for actuation refinement, leveraging minimal sensing with visual\\nfeedback. Trained entirely in simulation, the RL controller achieved a 99.8%\\nsuccess rate. When deployed on hardware, it achieved a 67% success rate in\\nzero-shot sim-to-real transfer, demonstrating robustness and adaptability. This\\napproach offers a scalable solution for SCAs in 3D visual servoing, with\\npotential for further refinement and expanded applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T17:41:55Z\"}"}
