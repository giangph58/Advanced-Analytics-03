These workflows consist of various jobs, such as code validation and\\ntesting, which developers must wait to complete before receiving feedback. The\\njobs can fail, which leads to unnecessary delays in build times, decreasing\\nproductivity for developers, and increasing costs for companies. To explore how\\ncompanies adopt CI/CD workflows and balance cost with quality assurance during\\noptimization, we studied 4 companies, reporting industry experiences with CI/CD\\npractices. Our findings reveal that organizations can confuse the distinction\\nbetween CI and CD, whereas code merge and product release serve as more\\neffective milestones for process optimization and risk control. While numerous\\ntools and research efforts target the post-merge phase to enhance productivity,\\nlimited attention has been given to the pre-merge phase, where early failure\\nprevention brings more impacts and less risks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T07:56:36Z\"}"}
