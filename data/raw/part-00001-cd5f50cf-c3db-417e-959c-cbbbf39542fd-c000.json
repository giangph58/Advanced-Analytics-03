Traditionally, these\\nevents are studied with computationally intensive hydrodynamical simulations.\\nIn this paper, we present a fast, physically motivated two-stage model for\\nTDEs. In the first stage, we model the star's tidal deformation using linear\\nstellar perturbation theory, treating the star as a collection of driven\\nharmonic oscillators. When the tidal energy exceeds a fraction $\\\\gamma$ of the\\nstar's gravitational binding energy (with $\\\\gamma \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{O}(1)$), we\\ntransition to the second stage, where we model the disrupted material as free\\nparticles. The parameter $\\\\gamma$ is determined with a one-time calibration to\\nhydrodynamical simulations. This method enables fast computation of the energy\\ndistribution $\\\\mathrm{d}M/\\\\mathrm{d}E$ and fallback rate\\n$\\\\mathrm{d}M/\\\\mathrm{d}T$, while offering physical insight into the disruption\\nprocess. We apply our model to MESA-generated profiles of middle-age\\nmain-sequence stars.
