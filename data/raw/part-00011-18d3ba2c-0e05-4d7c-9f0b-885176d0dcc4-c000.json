{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19923v1\", \"title\": \"Modeling of Parallel Single-Pixel Imaging for 3D Reconstruction: New\\n  Insights and Opportunities\", \"summary\": \"The growing prevalence of intelligent manufacturing and autonomous vehicles\\nhas intensified the demand for three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction under\\ncomplex reflection and transmission conditions. Traditional structured light\\ntechniques rely on inherent point-to-point triangulation, which limits accurate\\n3D measurements in these challenging scenarios. Parallel single-pixel imaging\\n(PSI) has demonstrated unprecedented superiority under extreme conditions and\\nhas emerged as a promising approach of accurate 3D measurements. However, a\\ncomplete theoretical model has not been reported in existing work to well\\nexplain its underlying mechanisms and quantitatively characterize its\\nperformance. In this study, a comprehensive theoretical model for the PSI\\nmethod is proposed, including imaging and noise models. The proposed imaging\\nmodel describes light transport coefficients under complex illumination,\\nelucidating the intrinsic mechanisms of successful 3D imaging using PSI. The\\ndeveloped noise model quantitatively analyzes the impact of environmental noise\\non measurement accuracy, offering a framework to guide the error analysis of a\\nPSI system. Numerical simulations and experimental results validate the\\nproposed models, revealing the generality and robustness of PSI. Finally,\\npotential research directions are highlighted to guide and inspire future\\ninvestigations. The established theoretical models lay a solid foundation of\\nPSI and brings new insights and opportunities for future application in more\\ndemanding 3D reconstruction tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:57:44Z\"}"}
