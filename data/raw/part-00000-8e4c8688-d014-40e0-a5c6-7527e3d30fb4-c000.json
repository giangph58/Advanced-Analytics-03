To address this, we introduce PicPersona-TOD, a\\nnovel dataset that incorporates user images as part of the persona, enabling\\npersonalized responses tailored to user-specific factors such as age or\\nemotional context. This is facilitated by first impressions, dialogue\\npolicy-guided prompting, and the use of external knowledge to reduce\\nhallucinations. Human evaluations confirm that our dataset enhances user\\nexperience, with personalized responses contributing to a more engaging\\ninteraction. Additionally, we introduce a new NLG model, Pictor, which not only\\npersonalizes responses, but also demonstrates robust performance across unseen\\ndomains https://github.com/JihyunLee1/PicPersona.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T09:15:58Z\"}"}
