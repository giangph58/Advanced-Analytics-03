{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11967v1\", \"title\": \"Securing the Skies: A Comprehensive Survey on Anti-UAV Methods,\\n  Benchmarking, and Future Directions\", \"summary\": \"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are indispensable for infrastructure\\ninspection, surveillance, and related tasks, yet they also introduce critical\\nsecurity challenges. This survey provides a wide-ranging examination of the\\nanti-UAV domain, centering on three core objectives-classification, detection,\\nand tracking-while detailing emerging methodologies such as diffusion-based\\ndata synthesis, multi-modal fusion, vision-language modeling, self-supervised\\nlearning, and reinforcement learning. We systematically evaluate\\nstate-of-the-art solutions across both single-modality and multi-sensor\\npipelines (spanning RGB, infrared, audio, radar, and RF) and discuss\\nlarge-scale as well as adversarially oriented benchmarks. Our analysis reveals\\npersistent gaps in real-time performance, stealth detection, and swarm-based\\nscenarios, underscoring pressing needs for robust, adaptive anti-UAV systems.\\nBy highlighting open research directions, we aim to foster innovation and guide\\nthe development of next-generation defense strategies in an era marked by the\\nextensive use of UAVs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T10:58:33Z\"}"}
