They\\nconstitute an exceedingly small fraction of the total number of polybenzenoid\\nhydrocarbons that can be constructed for a given number of benzenoid rings, and\\ntheir synthesis remains challenging. The archetype of such a system is Clar's\\ngoblet (C$_{38}$H$_{18}$), a diradical proposed by Erich Clar in 1972 and\\nrecently synthesized on a Au(111) surface. Here, we report the synthesis of a\\npi-extended Clar's goblet (C$_{76}$H$_{26}$), a tetraradical concealed\\nnon-Kekul\\\\'e polybenzenoid hydrocarbon, by a combined in-solution and\\non-surface synthetic approach. By means of low-temperature scanning tunneling\\nmicroscopy and atomic force microscopy, we characterized individual molecules\\nadsorbed on a Cu(111) surface. We provide insights into the electronic\\nproperties of this elusive molecule, including the many-body nature of its\\nground and excited states, by mean-field and multiconfigurational quantum\\nchemistry calculations.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:16:12Z\"}"}
