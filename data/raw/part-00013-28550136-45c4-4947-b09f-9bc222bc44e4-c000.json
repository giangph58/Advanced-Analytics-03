{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00447v1\", \"title\": \"Deterministic Scheduling over Wi-Fi 6 using Target Wake Time: An\\n  Experimental Approach\", \"summary\": \"Wi-Fi networks traditionally use Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) that\\nemploys CSMA/CA along with the binary backoff mechanism for channel access.\\nThis causes unavoidable contention overheads and does not provide performance\\nguarantees. In this work, we outline some issues that occur with the\\nprobabilistic channel access in highly congested scenarios and how those can be\\nmitigated using deterministic scheduling. Towards this, we propose to use\\nTarget Wake Time (TWT) - a feature introduced in Wi-Fi 6 as a power-saving\\nmechanism, to improve the performance of Wi-Fi. To gain insights into the\\nworkings of the TWT over commercially available off-the-shelf components and to\\nanalyze the factors that affect its performance, we carry out various\\nexperiments with it over our Wi-Fi 6 testbed. Using these insights and\\nanalysis, we formulate and solve an optimization problem to synthesize\\ndeterministic schedules and obtain the optimal values of various system\\nparameters. Lastly, we configure our testbed with these optimal parameter\\nvalues and show that the TWT based deterministic scheduling consistently\\nresults in better performance of the TWT-capable clients and overall system\\nperformance compared to traditional CSMA/CA based scheduling.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T10:43:01Z\"}"}
