{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21776v1\", \"title\": \"WebThinker: Empowering Large Reasoning Models with Deep Research\\n  Capability\", \"summary\": \"Large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, demonstrate\\nimpressive long-horizon reasoning capabilities. However, their reliance on\\nstatic internal knowledge limits their performance on complex,\\nknowledge-intensive tasks and hinders their ability to produce comprehensive\\nresearch reports requiring synthesis of diverse web information. To address\\nthis, we propose \\\\textbf{WebThinker}, a deep research agent that empowers LRMs\\nto autonomously search the web, navigate web pages, and draft research reports\\nduring the reasoning process. WebThinker integrates a \\\\textbf{Deep Web\\nExplorer} module, enabling LRMs to dynamically search, navigate, and extract\\ninformation from the web when encountering knowledge gaps. It also employs an\\n\\\\textbf{Autonomous Think-Search-and-Draft strategy}, allowing the model to\\nseamlessly interleave reasoning, information gathering, and report writing in\\nreal time. To further enhance research tool utilization, we introduce an\\n\\\\textbf{RL-based training strategy} via iterative online Direct Preference\\nOptimization (DPO). Extensive experiments on complex reasoning benchmarks\\n(GPQA, GAIA, WebWalkerQA, HLE) and scientific report generation tasks (Glaive)\\ndemonstrate that WebThinker significantly outperforms existing methods and\\nstrong proprietary systems. Our approach enhances LRM reliability and\\napplicability in complex scenarios, paving the way for more capable and\\nversatile deep research systems.
