{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17392v1\", \"title\": \"Edge-weighted Online Stochastic Matching Under Jaillet-Lu LP\", \"summary\": \"The online stochastic matching problem was introduced by [FMMM09], together\\nwith the $(1-\\\\frac1e)$-competitive Suggested Matching algorithm. In the most\\ngeneral edge-weighted setting, this ratio has not been improved for more than\\none decade, until recently [Yan24] beat the $1-\\\\frac1e$ bound and [QFZW23]\\nfurther improved the ratio to $0.650$. Both of these works measure the online\\ncompetitiveness against the offline LP relaxation introduced by [JL14]. This LP\\nhas also played an important role in other settings since it is a natural\\nchoice for two-choices online algorithms.\\n  In this paper, we propose an upper bound of $0.663$ and a lower bound of\\n$0.662$ for edge-weighted online stochastic matching under Jaillet-Lu LP.\\nFirst, we propose a hard instance and prove that the optimal online algorithm\\nfor this instance only has a competitive ratio $<0.663$. Then, we show that a\\nnear-optimal algorithm for this instance can be generalized to work on all\\ninstances and achieve a competitive ratio $>0.662$. It indicates that more\\npowerful LPs are necessary if we want to further improve the ratio by $0.001$.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS,cs.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T09:19:30Z\"}"}
