In addition, the reaction provides insight into\\nthe yields of atmospheric nuclear weapon testing. Because of their high level\\nof sensitivity, total neutron cross sections provide a great deal of constraint\\non the modeling of reaction cross sections through the $R$-matrix analyses used\\nfor nuclear data evaluations. Yet for $^{14}$N+$n$, only one high sensitivity\\nmeasurement is available and it lacks detailed information about its\\nexperimental conditions and uncertainties. With these motivations in mind, a\\nnew measurement of the $^{14}$N+$n$ total cross section has been performed at\\nthe nELBE facility. The cross sections were found to be in good agreement with\\nprevious data over much of the energy range with the key exception of the\\nlowest energy resonance at a neutron energy of 433 keV.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-ex\", \"categories\": \"nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T07:00:45Z\"}"}
