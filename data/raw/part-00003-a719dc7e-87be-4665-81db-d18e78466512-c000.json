{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20513v1\", \"title\": \"Enhancing Binary Search via Overlapping Partitions\", \"summary\": \"This paper considers the task of performing binary search under noisy\\ndecisions, focusing on the application of target area localization. In the\\npresence of noise, the classical partitioning approach of binary search is\\nprone to error propagation due to the use of strictly disjoint splits. While\\nexisting works on noisy binary search propose techniques such as query\\nrepetition or probabilistic updates to mitigate errors, they often lack\\nexplicit mechanisms to manage the trade-off between error probability and\\nsearch complexity, with some providing only asymptotic guarantees. To address\\nthis gap, we propose a binary search framework with tunable overlapping\\npartitions, which introduces controlled redundancy into the search process to\\nenhance robustness against noise. We analyze the performance of the proposed\\nalgorithm in both discrete and continuous domains for the problem of area\\nlocalization, quantifying how the overlap parameter impacts the trade-off\\nbetween search tree depth and error probability. Unlike previous methods, this\\napproach allows for direct control over the balance between reliability and\\nefficiency. Our results emphasize the versatility and effectiveness of the\\nproposed method, providing a principled extension to existing noisy search\\nparadigms and enabling new insights into the interplay between partitioning\\nstrategies and measurement reliability.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T07:56:02Z\"}"}
