Drawing on the psychology of\\nreciprocity bias, we theorize that public donations create social debts that\\nshape discretionary enforcement. Using quasi-experimental data from Chicago, we\\nfind that after 7-Eleven sponsored a police foundation gala, investigatory\\nstops, particularly of Black pedestrians, increased around its stores. These\\nfindings reveal a racialized pattern of donor bias in policing and call into\\nquestion the consequences of private donations to public law enforcement.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,q-fin.EC,stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T14:44:44Z\"}"}
