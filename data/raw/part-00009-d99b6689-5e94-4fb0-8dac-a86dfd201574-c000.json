{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21853v1\", \"title\": \"A Survey of Interactive Generative Video\", \"summary\": \"Interactive Generative Video (IGV) has emerged as a crucial technology in\\nresponse to the growing demand for high-quality, interactive video content\\nacross various domains. In this paper, we define IGV as a technology that\\ncombines generative capabilities to produce diverse high-quality video content\\nwith interactive features that enable user engagement through control signals\\nand responsive feedback. We survey the current landscape of IGV applications,\\nfocusing on three major domains: 1) gaming, where IGV enables infinite\\nexploration in virtual worlds; 2) embodied AI, where IGV serves as a\\nphysics-aware environment synthesizer for training agents in multimodal\\ninteraction with dynamically evolving scenes; and 3) autonomous driving, where\\nIGV provides closed-loop simulation capabilities for safety-critical testing\\nand validation. To guide future development, we propose a comprehensive\\nframework that decomposes an ideal IGV system into five essential modules:\\nGeneration, Control, Memory, Dynamics, and Intelligence. Furthermore, we\\nsystematically analyze the technical challenges and future directions in\\nrealizing each component for an ideal IGV system, such as achieving real-time\\ngeneration, enabling open-domain control, maintaining long-term coherence,\\nsimulating accurate physics, and integrating causal reasoning. We believe that\\nthis systematic analysis will facilitate future research and development in the\\nfield of IGV, ultimately advancing the technology toward more sophisticated and\\npractical applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:59:02Z\"}"}
