Our main\\ncontributions are threefold: First, for antichains in hyperarithmetic degrees,\\nwe prove that every maximal antichain necessarily attains Hausdorff dimension\\n1. Second, regarding chains in Turing degrees, we establish the existence of a\\nmaximal chain with Hausdorff dimension 0. Furthermore, under the assumption\\nthat $\\\\omega_1=(\\\\omega_1)^L$, we demonstrate the existence of such maximal\\nchains with $\\\\Pi^1_1$ complexity. Third, we extend our investigation to maximal\\nantichains of Turing degrees by analyzing both the packing dimension and\\neffective Hausdorff dimension.\", \"main_category\": \"math.LO\", \"categories\": \"math.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:44:28Z\"}"}
