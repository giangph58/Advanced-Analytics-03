In particular,\\nwe determine the polynomials $\\\\psi$ for which the sequence of iterates of the\\ncomposition operator $C_\\\\psi$ is topologizable (m-topologizable) acting on\\ncertain Gelfand-Shilov spaces defined by mean of Braun-Meise-Taylor weights. We\\nprove that the composition operators $C_\\\\psi$ with $\\\\psi$ a polynomial of\\ndegree greater than one are always topologizable in certain settings involving\\nGelfand-Shilov spaces, just like in the Schwartz space. Unlike in the Schwartz\\nspace setting, composition operators $C_\\\\psi$ associated with polynomials\\n$\\\\psi$ are not always $m-$topologizable. We also deal with the composition\\noperators $C_\\\\psi$ with $\\\\psi$ being an affine function acting on\\n$\\\\mathcal{S}_{\\\\omega}(\\\\mathbb{R})$ and find a complete characterization of\\ntopologizability and m-topologizability\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA,math.CA\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T09:57:29Z\"}"}
