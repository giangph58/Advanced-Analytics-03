We find that the geometries\\nthat satisfy this condition include those that solve the string field equations\\nor equivalently the gradient flow soliton type of equations. In addition, we\\ndemonstrate that if the underlying manifold $(M^{2n}, g, \\\\omega)$ admits a\\nholomorphic and Killing vector field $X$ that leaves $\\\\Phi$ also invariant,\\nthen the moduli spaces $\\\\text{M}^*_{HE}(M^{2n})$ admits an induced holomorphic\\nand Killing vector field $\\\\alpha_X$. Furthermore, if $X$ is covariantly\\nconstant with respect to the compatible connection $\\\\hat\\\\nabla$ with torsion a\\n3-form on $(M^{2n}, g, \\\\omega)$, then $\\\\alpha_X$ is also covariantly constant\\nwith respect to the compatible connection $\\\\hat D$ with torsion a 3-form on\\n$\\\\text{M}^*_{HE}(M^{2n})$ provided that $K^\\\\flat\\\\wedge X^\\\\flat$ is a\\n$(1,1)$-form with $K^\\\\flat=\\\\theta+2d\\\\Phi$ and $\\\\Phi$ is invariant under $X$ and\\n$IX$, where $I$ is the complex structure of $M^{2n}$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T10:57:39Z\"}"}
