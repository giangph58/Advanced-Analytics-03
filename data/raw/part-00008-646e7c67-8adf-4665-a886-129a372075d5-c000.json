{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10407v1\", \"title\": \"Enhancing DESI DR1 Full-Shape analyses using HOD-informed priors\", \"summary\": \"We present an analysis of DESI Data Release 1 (DR1) that incorporates Halo\\nOccupation Distribution (HOD)-informed priors into Full-Shape (FS) modeling of\\nthe power spectrum based on cosmological perturbation theory (PT). By\\nleveraging physical insights from the galaxy-halo connection, these\\nHOD-informed priors on nuisance parameters substantially mitigate projection\\neffects in extended cosmological models that allow for dynamical dark energy.\\nThe resulting credible intervals now encompass the posterior maximum from the\\nbaseline analysis using gaussian priors, eliminating a significant posterior\\nshift observed in baseline studies. In the $\\\\Lambda$CDM framework, a combined\\nDESI DR1 FS information and constraints from the DESI DR1 baryon acoustic\\noscillations (BAO)-including Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraints and a\\nweak prior on the scalar spectral index-yields $\\\\Omega_{\\\\rm m} = 0.2994\\\\pm\\n0.0090$ and $\\\\sigma_8 = 0.836^{+0.024}_{-0.027}$, representing improvements of\\napproximately 4% and 23% over the baseline analysis, respectively. For the\\n$w_0w_a$CDM model, our results from various data combinations are highly\\nconsistent, with all configurations converging to a region with $w_0 > -1$ and\\n$w_a < 0$. This convergence not only suggests intriguing hints of dynamical\\ndark energy but also underscores the robustness of our HOD-informed prior\\napproach in delivering reliable cosmological constraints.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:54:49Z\"}"}
