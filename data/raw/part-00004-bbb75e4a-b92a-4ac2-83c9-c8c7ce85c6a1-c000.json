By applying commonly used\\nnormalization methods to images from various vendors and studying their\\ninfluence on model generalization in transfer learning, we show that the\\nnonlinear characteristics of domain-specific image dynamics cannot be addressed\\nby simple linear transforms. To tackle this issue, we reformulate the image\\nharmonization task as an exposure correction problem and propose a method\\ntermed Global Deep Curve Estimation (GDCE) to reduce domain-specific exposure\\nmismatch. GDCE performs enhancement via a pre-defined polynomial function and\\nis trained with the help of a ``domain discriminator'', aiming to improve model\\ntransparency in downstream tasks compared to existing black-box methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,eess.IV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T10:24:57Z\"}"}
