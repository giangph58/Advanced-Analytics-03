We introduce BEER, a crossplatform graphical\\ninterface that accepts FASTA or Protein Data Bank (PDB) files, or manual\\nsequence entry, and instantly computes a suite of physicochemical metrics, such\\nas amino acid composition, Kyte Doolittle hydrophobicity profiles, net charge\\nversus pH curves with automatic isoelectric point determination, solubility\\npredictions, and key indices such as molecular weight, extinction coefficient,\\nGRAVY (grand average of hydropathicity) score, instability index, and\\naromaticity. BEER's interactive visualizations, including bar and pie charts,\\nhydropathy plots, residue level bead models, and radar diagrams make it easy to\\nexplore physicochemical properties of protein chains. A multichain module also\\nenables direct comparison of complex assemblies. Built in Python with\\nBioPython, PyQt5, and matplotlib, BEER delivers complete analyses of sequences\\nup to 10000 residues in under one second.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.BM\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.BM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T09:04:40Z\"}"}
