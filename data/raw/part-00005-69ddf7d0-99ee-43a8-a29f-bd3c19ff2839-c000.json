A Robin\\nboundary condition is imposed at z = b(t) to prevent individuals from leaving\\nthe domain, so that the shifting boundary acts as an impermeable wall-a\\n''piston''-that sweeps the individuals it encounters. Our analysis focuses on\\nthe cases where b(t) $\\\\sim$ ct^$\\\\beta$ with $\\\\beta$ $\\\\in$ [0, 1]. We prove\\nquantitative convergence results characterized by attraction toward\\nself-similar profiles, based on entropy techniques and Duhamel's principle.\\nWhen $\\\\beta$ goes through the critical value 1/2, the shape of the self-similar\\nasymptotic profile switches from Gaussian to exponential. In particular, this\\nprofile turns out to be stationary when $\\\\beta$ = 1, reflecting a delicate\\nbalance between diffusion and advection induced by the moving boundary.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:36:34Z\"}"}
