{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12060v1\", \"title\": \"Static to Dynamic Correlation Clustering\", \"summary\": \"Correlation clustering is a well-studied problem, first proposed by Bansal,\\nBlum, and Chawla [BBC04]. The input is an unweighted, undirected graph. The\\nproblem is to cluster the vertices so as to minimizing the number of edges\\nbetween vertices in different clusters and missing edges between vertices\\ninside the same cluster. This problem has a wide application in data mining and\\nmachine learning. We introduce a general framework that transforms existing\\nstatic correlation clustering algorithms into fully-dynamic ones that work\\nagainst an adaptive adversary.\\n  We show how to apply our framework to known efficient correlation clustering\\nalgorithms, starting from the classic 3-approximate Pivot algorithm from\\n[ACN08]. Applied to the most recent near-linear 1.437-approximation algorithm\\nfrom [CCL+25], we get a 1.437-approximation fully-dynamic algorithm that works\\nwith worst-case constant update time. The original static algorithm gets its\\napproximation factor with constant probability, and we get the same against an\\nadaptive adversary in the sense that for any given update step not known to our\\nalgorithm, our solution is a 1.437-approximation with constant probability when\\nwe reach this update.\\n  Previous dynamic algorithms had approximation factors around 3 in\\nexpectation, and they could only handle an oblivious adversary.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T13:13:16Z\"}"}
