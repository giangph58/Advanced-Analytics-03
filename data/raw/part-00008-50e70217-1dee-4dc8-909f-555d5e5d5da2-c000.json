{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06238v1\", \"title\": \"Infinite Boundary Friction Limit for Weak Solutions of the Stochastic\\n  Navier-Stokes Equations\", \"summary\": \"We address convergence of the unique weak solutions of the 2D stochastic\\nNavier-Stokes equations with Navier boundary conditions, as the boundary\\nfriction is taken uniformly to infinity, to the unique weak solution under the\\nno-slip condition. Our result is that for initial velocity in $L^2_x$, the\\nconvergence holds in probability in $C_tW^{-\\\\varepsilon,2}_x \\\\cap L^2_tL^2_x$\\nfor any $0 < \\\\varepsilon$. The noise is of transport-stretching type, although\\nthe theorem holds with other transport, multiplicative and additive noise\\nstructures. This seems to be the first work concerning the large boundary\\nfriction limit with noise, and convergence for weak solutions, due to only\\n$L^2_{x}$ initial data, appears new even deterministically.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T17:34:29Z\"}"}
