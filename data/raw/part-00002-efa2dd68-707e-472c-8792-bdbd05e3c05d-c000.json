The goal\\nis to fully exploit the capabilities of both MA and RIS, constructing a better\\ntransmission environment for the co-existing primary and secondary transmission\\nsystems. For both parasitic SR (PSR) and commensal SR (CSR) scenarios with the\\nchannel uncertainties experienced by all transmission links, we design a robust\\ntransmission scheme with the goal of maximizing the primary rate while ensuring\\nthe secondary transmission quality. To address the maximization problem with\\nthorny non-convex characteristics, we propose an alternating optimization\\nframework that utilizes the General S-Procedure, General Sign-Definiteness\\nPrinciple, successive convex approximation (SCA), and simulated annealing (SA)\\nimproved particle swarm optimization (SA-PSO) algorithms. Numerical results\\nvalidate that the CSR scenario significantly outperforms the PSR scenario in\\nterms of primary rate, and also show that compared to the fixed-position\\nantenna scheme, the proposed MA scheme can increase the primary rate by 1.62\\nbps/Hz and 2.37 bps/Hz for the PSR and CSR scenarios, respectively.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T03:28:50Z\"}"}
