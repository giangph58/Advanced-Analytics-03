{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06137v1\", \"title\": \"Coexistence of magnetic and dielectric glassy states in alternating\\n  kagome and triangular lattice LuBaCo$_4$O$_7$ cobaltite\", \"summary\": \"To date, the alternating kagome and triangular lattice cobaltites,\\nRBaCo$_4$O$_7$ (R = Ca, Y, and rare earth elements), have been well studied for\\ntheir large structural distortions, anisotropic exchange interactions, chiral\\nspin liquid states, and giant multiferroic properties. Here, we report the\\nco-existence of magnetic and dielectric glassy states in LuBaCo$_4$O$_7$ below\\n50 K. AC magnetization studies show an absence of conventional spin-freezing\\nbehavior. The cooling and heating in unequal fields (CHUF), thermal cycling,\\nand time-dependent magnetization measurements at low temperature ($T$) show the\\npresence of magnetic glassy state. The $T$-dependent dielectric constant\\n$\\\\epsilon'$ measurements exhibit a strong frequency-independent response at the\\nfirst-order structural phase transition $T = 160$ K (trigonal $P31c$ to\\nmonoclinic $Cc$) and also significant features at the $T = 110$ K (monoclinic\\n$Cc$ to orthorhombic $Pbn2_1$) phase transition. Further, $\\\\epsilon'$ shows a\\nfrequency-independent peak at 43 K ($Pbn2_1$) and also dipolar glassy features\\nbelow 20 K ($Cc$). The non-equilibrium magnetic glassy dynamics and dipolar\\nglassy state at low-$T$ arises from the kinetic arrest of $Cc$ and $Pbn2_1$\\nphases. From the dielectric probe, we are able to clearly distinguish the\\nkinetically arrested phases at low-$T$ , whereas the bulk magnetization studies\\nare unable to do so as the arrested phases have low magnetic moments.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T15:33:14Z\"}"}
