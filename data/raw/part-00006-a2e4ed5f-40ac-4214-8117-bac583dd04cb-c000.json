Micro Aerial\\nVehicles (MAVs) are preferred for navigating in these complex, GPS-denied\\nscenarios because of their agility, low power consumption, and limited\\ncomputational capabilities. In this paper, we propose a Reinforcement Learning\\nbased Deep-Proximal Policy Optimization (D-PPO) algorithm to enhance realtime\\nnavigation through improving the computation efficiency. The end-to-end network\\nis trained in 3D realistic meta-environments created using the Unreal Engine.\\nWith these trained meta-weights, the MAV system underwent extensive\\nexperimental trials in real-world indoor environments. The results indicate\\nthat the proposed method reduces computational latency by 91\\\\% during training\\nperiod without significant degradation in performance. The algorithm was tested\\non a DJI Tello drone, yielding similar results.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T11:14:37Z\"}"}
