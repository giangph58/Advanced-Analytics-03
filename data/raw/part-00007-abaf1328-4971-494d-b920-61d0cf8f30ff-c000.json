Precise control over the\\nmagnetic moment of individual microspheres is crucial for these applications.\\nThis study employs widefield quantum diamond microscopy to map the stray\\nmagnetic fields of individual vaterite microspheres (3-10 um) loaded with Fe3O4\\nMNPs of varying sizes (5 nm, 10 nm, and 20 nm). By analyzing over 35\\nmicrospheres under a 222 mT external magnetizing field, we measured\\npeak-to-peak stray field amplitudes of 41 uT for 5 nm and 10 nm\\nsuperparamagnetic MNPs, reflecting their comparable magnetic response, and 12\\nuT for 20 nm ferrimagnetic MNPs, due to distinct magnetization behavior.\\nFinite-element simulations confirm variations in MNP distribution and\\nmagnetization uniformity within the vaterite matrix, with each microsphere\\nencapsulating thousands of MNPs to generate its magnetization. This\\nhigh-resolution magnetic imaging approach yields critical insights into\\nMNP-loaded vaterite, enabling optimized synthesis and magnetically controlled\\nsystems for precision therapies and diagnostics.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.bio-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.bio-ph,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T07:13:32Z\"}"}
