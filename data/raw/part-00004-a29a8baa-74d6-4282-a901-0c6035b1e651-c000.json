In the\\nliterature, it has been used primarily for tasks that explore its powerful\\nrepresentation capabilities, such as for image reconstruction. In this work, we\\npresent a first approach to make dictionary learning work for shape\\nrecognition, considering specifically geometrical shapes. As we demonstrate,\\nthe choice of the underlying optimization method has a significant impact on\\nrecognition quality. Experimental results confirm that dictionary learning may\\nbe an interesting method for shape recognition tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T08:05:16Z\"}"}
