It is an age-structured non-linear\\nequation in which age corresponds to the elapsed time since the last discharge,\\nand models many interesting dynamics depending on the type of interactions\\nbetween neurons. We investigate the linearized stability of this equation by\\nconsidering a discrete delay, which accounts for the possibility of a synaptic\\ndelay due to the time needed to transmit a nerve impulse from one neuron to the\\nrest of the ensemble. We state a stability criterion that allows to determine\\nif a steady state is linearly stable or unstable depending on the delay and the\\ninteraction between neurons. Our approach relies on the study of the asymptotic\\nbehavior of related Volterra-type integral equations in terms of theirs Laplace\\ntransforms. The analysis is complemented with numerical simulations\\nillustrating the change of stability of a steady state in terms of the delay\\nand the intensity of interconnections.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS,math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T08:17:17Z\"}"}
