{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04913v1\", \"title\": \"The GRINTA hard X-ray mission: an Explorer of the Transient Sky\", \"summary\": \"The era of time domain multi-messenger (MM) astrophysics requires sensitive,\\nlarge field-of-view (FoV) observatories that are able to quickly react in order\\nto respond to alerts from gravitational wave (GW) triggers, neutrino\\ndetections, and transient sources from all parts of the electromagnetic (EM)\\nspectrum. This is particularly true at hard X-rays and soft gamma-rays where\\nthe EM counterparts to GW triggers, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), emit most of their\\nflux. While the present decade has a number of instruments capable of\\naccomplishing this task, there are no missions planned for the 2030's when\\nimproved MM facilities will detect many more events. It is in this context that\\nwe present the GRINTA mission concept. GRINTA has a large area, large FoV\\ndetector to search for short, impulsive events in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy\\nrange and a coded mask telescope for localizing and performing follow-up\\nobservations of sources from 5-200 keV. While GRINTA's main scientific goal is\\nstudying MM events, the instruments will observe numerous other sources to\\nexplore the sky at hard X-rays/soft gamma-rays.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T10:47:36Z\"}"}
