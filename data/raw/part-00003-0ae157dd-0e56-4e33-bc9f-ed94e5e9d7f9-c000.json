This Letter presents a measurement of the suppression of\\nlarge-radius jets with a radius parameter of $R = 1.0$ and its dependence on\\nthe jet substructure. The measurement uses 1.72 nb$^{-1}$ of Pb+Pb data and 255\\npb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ data, both at $\\\\sqrt{s_{_\\\\mathrm{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV, recorded\\nwith the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Large-radius jets are\\nreconstructed by reclustering $R = 0.2$ calorimetric jets and are measured for\\ntransverse momentum above $200$ GeV. Jet substructure is evaluated using\\ncharged-particle tracks, and the overall level of jet suppression is quantified\\nusing the jet nuclear modification factor ($R_\\\\mathrm{AA}$). The jet\\n$R_\\\\mathrm{AA}$ is measured as a function of jet $p_{\\\\mathrm{T}}$, the charged\\n$k_t$ splitting scale ($\\\\sqrt{d_{12}}$), and the angular separation ($dR_{12}$)\\nof two leading sub-jets. The jet $R_\\\\mathrm{AA}$ gradually decreases with\\nincreasing $\\\\sqrt{d_{12}}$, implying significantly stronger suppression of\\nlarge-radius jets with larger $k_t$ splitting scale. The jet $R_\\\\mathrm{AA}$\\ngradually decreases for $dR_{12}$ in the range $0.01{-}0.2$ and then remains\\nconsistent with a constant for $dR_{12} \\\\gtrsim 0.2$. The observed significant\\ndependence of jet suppression on the jet substructure will provide new insights\\ninto its role in the quenching process.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-ex\", \"categories\": \"nucl-ex,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T08:01:08Z\"}"}
