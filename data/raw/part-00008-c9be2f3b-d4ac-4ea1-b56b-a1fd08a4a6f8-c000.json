{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00418v1\", \"title\": \"Thermal noise induced probability switching in magnetic tunnel junction\\n  based on spin-circuit simulation\", \"summary\": \"The probability switching characteristics in spin transfer torque magnetic\\ntunnel junctions (STT-MTJs) are simulated by considering thermal noise using a\\nspin-circuit module. Thermal noise significantly affects the probability\\nswitching for pulse durations exceeding 10 ns, while no probability switching\\nproperties are observed for pulses shorter than 1 ns due to the precessional\\nswitching. For pulse durations between 1 ns and 10 ns, the occurrence of mixed\\nprobability and abrupt switching suggests that thermal noise partially\\ninfluences the switching properties. These results demonstrate the\\neffectiveness of our simulation model in capturing the MTJ properties under the\\ninfluence of thermal noise. The spin-circuit module used in this study lays the\\ngroundwork for future circuit system designs utilizing MTJ devices, such as\\ntrue random number generators and neural network computing.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T09:33:12Z\"}"}
