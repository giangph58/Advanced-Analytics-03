We demonstrate that the relative value\\nfunction under the constant order policy satisfies the Wiener-Hopf equation. We\\nemploy ladder processes associated with a random walk featuring i.i.d.\\nincrements, to obtain an explicit solution for the relative value function.\\nThis solution can be expressed as a quadratic form and a term that grows\\nsublinearly. Then we perform an approximate policy iteration step on the\\nconstant order policy and bound the approximation errors as a function of the\\ncost of losing a sale. This leads to our main result that projected inventory\\nlevel policies are asymptotically optimal as the leadtime grows when the cost\\nof losing a sale is sufficiently large and demand has a finite second moment.\\nUnder these conditions, we also show that the optimal cost rate approaches\\ninfinity, proportional to the square root of the cost of losing a sale.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,math.OC,G.3\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T11:38:35Z\"}"}
