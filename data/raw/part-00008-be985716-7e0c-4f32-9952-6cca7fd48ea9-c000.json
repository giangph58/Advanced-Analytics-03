While these predominantly\\nanalog optical accelerators bypass digitization to perform parallel\\nfloating-point computations, scaling optical hardware to map large-vector sizes\\nfor AI tasks remains challenging. Here, we overcome this limitation by\\nunfolding scalar operations in time and introducing a\\nphotonic-heater-in-lightpath (PHIL) unit for all-optical temporal integration.\\nCounterintuitively, we exploit a slow heat dissipation process to integrate\\noptical signals modulated at 50 GHz bridging the speed gap between the widely\\napplied thermo-optic effects and ultrafast photonics. This architecture\\nsupports optical end-to-end signal processing, eliminates inefficient\\nelectro-optical conversions, and enables both linear and nonlinear operations\\nwithin a unified framework. Our results demonstrate a scalable path towards\\nhigh-speed photonic computing through thermally driven integration.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,cs.AI,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T13:39:18Z\"}"}
