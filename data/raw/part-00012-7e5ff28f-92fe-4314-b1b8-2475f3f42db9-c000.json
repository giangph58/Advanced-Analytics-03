Here, we study the stability of these protocols against Hamiltonian\\ncharacterization errors. For this, we bound the maximum separation between the\\ntarget and the implemented Hamiltonians. Additionally, we obtain an upper bound\\nfor the deviation in the expected value of an observable. We further propose a\\nprotocol for mitigating calibration errors which resembles dynamical-decoupling\\ntechniques. These results open the possibility of scaling digital-analog to\\nintermediate and large scale systems while having an estimation on the errors\\ncommitted.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:49:20Z\"}"}
