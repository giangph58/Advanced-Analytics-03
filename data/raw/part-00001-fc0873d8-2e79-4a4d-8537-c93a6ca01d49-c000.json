While the foundational Leibniz rule addresses\\nfirst-order derivatives, its extension to higher orders typically involves\\nidentities relating multiple distinct operators. In contrast, we introduce a\\nnovel operator equation involving only a single $n$\\\\textsuperscript{th}-order\\ndifferential operator. We demonstrate that, under certain mild conditions, this\\nequation serves to characterize such operators. Specifically, our results show\\nthat these higher-order differential operators can be identified as particular\\nsolutions to this single-operator identity. This approach provides a framework\\nfor understanding the algebraic structure of higher-order differential\\noperators acting on function spaces.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CA\", \"categories\": \"math.CA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T11:06:44Z\"}"}
