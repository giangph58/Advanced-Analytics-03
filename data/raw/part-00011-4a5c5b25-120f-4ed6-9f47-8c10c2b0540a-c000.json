In this work, we present a\\ncombined prediction and planning approach that allows to consider the influence\\nof the planned vehicle behavior on a pedestrian and predict a pedestrian's\\nreaction. We plan the behavior by solving two consecutive optimal control\\nproblems (OCPs) analytically, using variational calculus. We perform a\\nvalidation step that assesses whether the planned vehicle behavior is adequate\\nto trigger a certain pedestrian reaction, which accounts for the closed-loop\\ncharacteristics of prediction and planning influencing each other. In this\\nstep, we model the influence of the planned vehicle behavior on the pedestrian\\nusing a probabilistic behavior acceptance model that returns an estimate for\\nthe crossing probability. The probabilistic modeling of the pedestrian reaction\\nfacilitates considering the pedestrian's costs, thereby improving cooperative\\nbehavior planning. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach in\\nsimulated vehicle-pedestrian interactions with varying initial settings and\\nhighlight the decision making capabilities of the planning approach.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T13:38:37Z\"}"}
