{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04214v1\", \"title\": \"CM1 -- A Dataset for Evaluating Few-Shot Information Extraction with\\n  Large Vision Language Models\", \"summary\": \"The automatic extraction of key-value information from handwritten documents\\nis a key challenge in document analysis. A reliable extraction is a\\nprerequisite for the mass digitization efforts of many archives. Large Vision\\nLanguage Models (LVLM) are a promising technology to tackle this problem\\nespecially in scenarios where little annotated training data is available. In\\nthis work, we present a novel dataset specifically designed to evaluate the\\nfew-shot capabilities of LVLMs. The CM1 documents are a historic collection of\\nforms with handwritten entries created in Europe to administer the Care and\\nMaintenance program after World War Two. The dataset establishes three\\nbenchmarks on extracting name and birthdate information and, furthermore,\\nconsiders different training set sizes. We provide baseline results for two\\ndifferent LVLMs and compare performances to an established full-page extraction\\nmodel. While the traditional full-page model achieves highly competitive\\nperformances, our experiments show that when only a few training samples are\\navailable the considered LVLMs benefit from their size and heavy pretraining\\nand outperform the classical approach.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:08:58Z\"}"}
