{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24032v1\", \"title\": \"BBoxCut: A Targeted Data Augmentation Technique for Enhancing Wheat Head\\n  Detection Under Occlusions\", \"summary\": \"Wheat plays a critical role in global food security, making it one of the\\nmost extensively studied crops. Accurate identification and measurement of key\\ncharacteristics of wheat heads are essential for breeders to select varieties\\nfor cross-breeding, with the goal of developing nutrient-dense, resilient, and\\nsustainable cultivars. Traditionally, these measurements are performed\\nmanually, which is both time-consuming and inefficient. Advances in digital\\ntechnologies have paved the way for automating this process. However, field\\nconditions pose significant challenges, such as occlusions of leaves,\\noverlapping wheat heads, varying lighting conditions, and motion blur. In this\\npaper, we propose a novel data augmentation technique, BBoxCut, which uses\\nrandom localized masking to simulate occlusions caused by leaves and\\nneighboring wheat heads. We evaluated our approach using three state-of-the-art\\nobject detectors and observed mean average precision (mAP) gains of 2.76, 3.26,\\nand 1.9 for Faster R-CNN, FCOS, and DETR, respectively. Our augmentation\\ntechnique led to significant improvements both qualitatively and\\nquantitatively. In particular, the improvements were particularly evident in\\nscenarios involving occluded wheat heads, demonstrating the robustness of our\\nmethod in challenging field conditions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T12:59:02Z\"}"}
