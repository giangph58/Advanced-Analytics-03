The related transport problem is an\\n(initial) inflow boundary value problem. This problem is characteristic with\\nvariable multiplicity, that is, the rank of the boundary matrix (here a scalar)\\nis not constant on the boundary. It is known that for these types of (initial)\\nboundary value problems the full higher order Sobolev regularity cannot\\ngenerally be established. In this paper we present Sobolev regularity results\\nfor solutions of linear Boltzmann transport problems when the data belongs to\\nappropriate anisotropic Sobolev spaces whose elements are zero on the inflow\\nand characteristic parts of the boundary.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T09:39:32Z\"}"}
