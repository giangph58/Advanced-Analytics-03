Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) are commonly employed as a\\nsource of coherent acoustic phonons. The strain associated with SAWs couples to\\nmagnetization of magnetic materials via magnetoelastic coupling and/or\\nspin-rotation coupling. A typical SAW device is formed on a piezoelectric\\nsubstrate with anisotropic crystal structure. Since the form of strain depends\\non the material parameters and structure of the SAW device, it is of vital\\nimportance to understand its character. In this paper, we present a\\ncomprehensive methodology to numerically calculate the SAW velocity, SAW\\nexcitation efficiency, lattice displacement and all strain components\\nassociated with SAW. LiNbO$_3$ is used as a prototypical material system. All\\nquantities depend on the SAW propagation direction with respect to the\\ncrystalline axis and on the electrical boundary conditions. In contrast to\\nnon-piezoelectric isotropic media, we find that all shear strain components can\\nbe induced in LiNbO$_3$, with their amplitude and relative phase (with respect\\nto the longitudinal strain) dependent on the propagation direction and the\\nboundary conditions at the LiNbO$_3$ surface. These results offer a robust\\nfoundation for analyzing strain-driven magnon-phonon coupling mechanisms and\\ncontribute to designing strain-engineered functional magnonic and phononic\\ndevices.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T08:44:59Z\"}"}
