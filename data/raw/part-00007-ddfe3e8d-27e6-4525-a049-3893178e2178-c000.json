Despite a wide range of\\napplications, there has been almost no theoretical investigation into the\\nassociated issues of filling and draining geometric environments. This is\\npartly because a globally controlled system (i.e., passive matter) exhibits\\nhighly complex behavior that cannot be locally restricted. Thus, there is a\\nstrong need for theoretical studies that investigate these models both (1) in\\nterms of relative power to each other, and (2) from a complexity theory\\nperspective. In this work, we provide (1) general tools for comparing and\\ncontrasting different models of global control, and (2) both complexity and\\nalgorithmic results on filling and draining.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CG\", \"categories\": \"cs.CG,F.2.2\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T14:34:11Z\"}"}
