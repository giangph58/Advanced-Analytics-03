This has led to the introduction of numerous weaker\\ncontinuity conditions that enable more general theorem statements. In the\\ncontext of unstructured optimization over topological domains, we collect these\\ncontinuity conditions from disparate sources and review their applications. As\\nprimary outcomes, we prove two comprehensive implication diagrams that\\nestablish novel connections between the reviewed conditions. In doing so, we\\nalso introduce previously missing continuity conditions and provide new\\ncounterexamples.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T04:53:32Z\"}"}
