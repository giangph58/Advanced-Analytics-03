Hardware and software mechanisms have been\\nproposed to ease this burden, but neither proved sufficient, prompting a\\nvariety of bug detection tools.\\n  With the sunset of Intel Optane comes the rise of Compute Express Link (CXL)\\nfor PM. In this position paper, we discuss the impact of CXL's disaggregated\\nand heterogeneous nature in the development of crash-consistent PM\\napplications, and outline three research directions: hardware primitives,\\npersistency frameworks, and bug detection tools.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.ET\", \"categories\": \"cs.ET\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T13:47:35Z\"}"}
