{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09892v1\", \"title\": \"Vermilion: A Traffic-Aware Reconfigurable Optical Interconnect with\\n  Formal Throughput Guarantees\", \"summary\": \"The increasing gap between datacenter traffic volume and the capacity of\\nelectrical switches has driven the development of reconfigurable network\\ndesigns utilizing optical circuit switching. Recent advancements, particularly\\nthose featuring periodic fixed-duration reconfigurations, have achieved\\npractical end-to-end delays of just a few microseconds. However, current\\ndesigns rely on multi-hop routing to enhance utilization, which can lead to a\\nsignificant reduction in worst-case throughput and added overhead from\\ncongestion control and routing complexity. These factors pose significant\\noperational challenges for the large-scale deployment of these technologies.\\n  We present Vermilion, a reconfigurable optical interconnect that breaks the\\nthroughput barrier of existing periodic reconfigurable networks, without the\\nneed for multi-hop routing -- thus eliminating congestion control and\\nsimplifying routing to direct communication. Vermilion adopts a traffic-aware\\napproach while retaining the simplicity of periodic fixed-duration\\nreconfigurations, similar to RotorNet. We formally establish throughput bounds\\nfor Vermilion, demonstrating that it achieves at least $33\\\\%$ more throughput\\nin the worst-case compared to existing designs. The key innovation of Vermilion\\nis its short traffic-aware periodic schedule, derived using a matrix rounding\\ntechnique. This schedule is then combined with a traffic-oblivious periodic\\nschedule to efficiently manage any residual traffic. Our evaluation results\\nsupport our theoretical findings, revealing significant performance gains for\\ndatacenter workloads.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI,cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T05:35:42Z\"}"}
