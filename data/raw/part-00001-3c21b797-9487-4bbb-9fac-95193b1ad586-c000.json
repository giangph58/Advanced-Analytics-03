{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20448v1\", \"title\": \"On the minimum constant resistance curvature conjecture of graphs\", \"summary\": \"Let $G$ be a connected graph with $n$ vertices. The resistance distance\\n$\\\\Omega_{G}(i,j)$ between any two vertices $i$ and $j$ of $G$ is defined as the\\neffective resistance between them in the electrical network constructed from\\n$G$ by replacing each edge with a unit resistor. The resistance matrix of $G$,\\ndenoted by $R_G$, is an $n \\\\times n$ matrix whose $(i,j)$-entry is equal to\\n$\\\\Omega_{G}(i,j)$. The resistance curvature $\\\\kappa_i$ in the vertex $i$ is\\ndefined as the $i$-th component of the vector $(R_G)^{-1}\\\\mathbf{1}$, where\\n$\\\\mathbf{1}$ denotes the all-one vector. If all the curvatures in the vertices\\nof $G$ are equal, then we say that $G$ has constant resistance curvature.\\nRecently, Devriendt, Ottolini and Steinerberger \\\\cite{kde} conjectured that the\\ncycle $C_n$ is extremal in the sense that its curvature is minimum among graphs\\nwith constant resistance curvature. In this paper, we confirm the conjecture.\\nAs a byproduct, we also solve an open problem proposed by Xu, Liu, Yang and Das\\n\\\\cite{kxu} in 2016. Our proof mainly relies on the characterization of maximum\\nvalue of the sum of resistance distances from a given vertex to all the other\\nvertices in 2-connected graphs.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T05:45:31Z\"}"}
