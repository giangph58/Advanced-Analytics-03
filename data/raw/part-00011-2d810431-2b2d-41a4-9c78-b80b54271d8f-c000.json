Building on\\nthis representation, we propose an efficient framework for approximate Bayesian\\ninference using belief propagation (BP) and expectation propagation, extending\\nits applicability beyond Gaussian assumptions. By leveraging an appropriate BP\\nmessage representation and a suitable schedule, our method achieves stable\\nconvergence with accurate mean and variance estimates. Numerical experiments in\\nrepresentative scenarios from communications demonstrate the practical\\npotential of the proposed framework for uncertainty-aware inference in\\nprobabilistic systems operating across both time and frequency domain.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T11:47:42Z\"}"}
