In this work, the spherical Airy wavepacket, a three\\ndimensional light field with an Airy function distribution in the radial\\ndirection in the full space time domain, is introduced and experimentally\\ndemonstrated. Leveraging the recently developed spatiotemporal hologram\\ntechnique and an exponential polar coordinate transformation, spherical Airy\\nwavepacket is sculpted to exhibit ultrafast autofocusing with a dramatically\\nreduced depth of focus compared to conventional Gaussian beams and circular\\nAiry beams. Experimental measurements confirm its nonlinear intensity surge and\\ntight spatiotemporal confinement.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T14:18:56Z\"}"}
