{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17512v1\", \"title\": \"Admittance Identification of Grid-Forming Inverters Using Time and\\n  Frequency-Domain Techniques\", \"summary\": \"The increasing integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) into the power\\ngrid introduces new challenges, requiring detailed electromagnetic transient\\n(EMT) studies to analyze system interactions. Despite these needs, access to\\nthe internal firmware of power electronic devices remains restricted due to\\nstringent nondisclosure agreements enforced by manufacturers. To address this,\\nwe explore three system identification techniques: sweep frequency response\\nanalysis (SFRA), step excitation method (SEM), and eigensystem realization\\nalgorithm (ERA). SFRA employs sinusoidal signals of varying frequencies to\\nmeasure the system's frequency response, while SEM and ERA utilize step\\nfunctions to derive time-domain responses and transform them into\\nLaplace-domain transfer functions. All three approaches are shown to provide\\nconsistent results in identifying the dq admittance of grid-forming inverters\\n(GFM) over a frequency range of 1 Hz to 100 Hz.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T12:56:26Z\"}"}
