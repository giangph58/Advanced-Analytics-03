{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04922v1\", \"title\": \"Canny2Palm: Realistic and Controllable Palmprint Generation for\\n  Large-scale Pre-training\", \"summary\": \"Palmprint recognition is a secure and privacy-friendly method of biometric\\nidentification. One of the major challenges to improve palmprint recognition\\naccuracy is the scarcity of palmprint data. Recently, a popular line of\\nresearch revolves around the synthesis of virtual palmprints for large-scale\\npre-training purposes. In this paper, we propose a novel synthesis method named\\nCanny2Palm that extracts palm textures with Canny edge detector and uses them\\nto condition a Pix2Pix network for realistic palmprint generation. By\\nre-assembling palmprint textures from different identities, we are able to\\ncreate new identities by seeding the generator with new assemblies. Canny2Palm\\nnot only synthesizes realistic data following the distribution of real\\npalmprints but also enables controllable diversity to generate large-scale new\\nidentities. On open-set palmprint recognition benchmarks, models pre-trained\\nwith Canny2Palm synthetic data outperform the state-of-the-art with up to 7.2%\\nhigher identification accuracy. Moreover, the performance of models pre-trained\\nwith Canny2Palm continues to improve given 10,000 synthetic IDs while those\\nwith existing methods already saturate, demonstrating the potential of our\\nmethod for large-scale pre-training.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T03:37:07Z\"}"}
