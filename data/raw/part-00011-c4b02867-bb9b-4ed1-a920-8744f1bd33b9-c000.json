{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12725v1\", \"title\": \"The $S$-resolvent estimates for the Dirac operator on hyperbolic and\\n  spherical spaces\", \"summary\": \"This seminal paper marks the beginning of our investigation into on the\\nspectral theory based on $S$-spectrum applied to the Dirac operator on\\nmanifolds. Specifically, we examine in detail the cases of the Dirac operator\\n$\\\\mathcal{D}_H$ on hyperbolic space and the Dirac operator $\\\\mathcal{D}_S$ on\\nthe spherical space, where these operators, and their squares $\\\\mathcal{D}_H^2$\\nand $\\\\mathcal{D}_S^2$, can be written in a very explicit form. This fact is\\nvery important for the application of the spectral theory on the $S$-spectrum.\\nIn fact, let $T$ denote a (right) linear Clifford operator, the $S$-spectrum is\\nassociated with a second-order polynomial in the operator $T$, specifically the\\noperator defined as $ Q_s(T) := T^2 - 2s_0T + |s|^2. $ This allows us to\\nassociate to the Dirac operator boundary conditions that can be of Dirichlet\\ntype but also of Robin-like type. Moreover, our theory is not limited to\\nHilbert modules; it is applicable to Banach modules as well. The spectral\\ntheory based on the $S$-spectrum has gained increasing attention in recent\\nyears, particularly as it aims to provide quaternionic quantum mechanics with a\\nsolid mathematical foundation from the perspective of spectral theory. This\\ntheory was extended to Clifford operators, and more recently, the spectral\\ntheorem has been adapted to this broader context. The $S$-spectrum is crucial\\nfor defining the so-called $S$-functional calculus for quaternionic and\\nClifford operators in various forms. This includes bounded as well as unbounded\\noperators, where suitable estimates of sectorial and bi-sectorial type for the\\n$S$-resolvent operator are essential for the convergence of the Dunford\\nintegrals in this setting.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T08:06:18Z\"}"}
