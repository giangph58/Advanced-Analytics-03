This includes elimination theory, patchworking\\nover ${\\\\mathbb R}$, and computing basic geometric invariants over ${\\\\mathbb\\nC}$.\\n  Our results apply e.g. to eliminating variables in systems of ODEs, such as\\nreaction networks, computing Newton polytopes of discriminants, constructing\\nreal polynomial maps and reaction networks with prescribed topology.\\n  Along the way, we assign a cohomology ring to an arbitrary tropical fan, and\\nrelate reducible ECIs to arrangements of pairwise intersecting planes.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T16:28:47Z\"}"}
