Hybrid unknowns corresponding to transmission variables are\\nintroduced at the element interfaces and the physical unknowns inside the\\nelements are eliminated, resulting in a hybridized system with favorable\\nproperties for fast iterative solution. In this paper, we extend the CHDG\\nmethod, initially studied for the Helmholtz equation, to the time-harmonic\\nMaxwell equations. We prove that the local problems stemming from hybridization\\nare well-posed and that the fixed-point iteration naturally associated to the\\nhybridized system is contractive. We propose a 3D implementation with a\\ndiscrete scheme based on nodal basis functions. The resulting solver and\\ndifferent iterative strategies are studied with several numerical examples\\nusing a high-performance parallel C++ code.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T09:47:49Z\"}"}
