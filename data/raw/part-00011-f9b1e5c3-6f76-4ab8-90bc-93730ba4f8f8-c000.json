{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04198v1\", \"title\": \"A Predictive Theory of Electrochemical Ostwald Ripening for\\n  Electrodeposited Lithium Metal\", \"summary\": \"In this work, we present a theoretical framework that describes the evolution\\nof lithium nuclei under the competing effects of electroplating and surface\\nenergy-driven redistribution (electrochemical Ostwald ripening). Our model\\nintroduces a formulation that accounts for solid electrolyte interphase (SEI)\\nresistance, electrolyte conductivity, and electrode wettability, capturing the\\ntransition from SEI to electrolyte-limited growth regimes. We identify\\nasymptotic behaviors for high and low current densities, quantify the\\nconditions under which ripening dominates, and derive analytical expressions\\nfor nucleus size, density, and surface coverage. Model predictions show\\nexcellent agreement with experimental data across multiple datasets. The\\nresults reveal how SEI and electrolyte conductivity, current density and\\nmetal-electrode contact angle govern deposition morphology and Coulombic\\nefficiency. Based on these insights, we outline experimentally accessible\\nguidelines to improve battery efficiency and cycling stability - offering a\\nsimple yet predictive approach for optimizing metal electrodeposition processes\\nin battery systems and beyond.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.soft,physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T07:53:01Z\"}"}
