{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19827v1\", \"title\": \"Quantum oracles for the finite element method\", \"summary\": \"In order to assess potential advantages of quantum algorithms that require\\nquantum oracles as subroutines, the careful evaluation of the overall\\ncomplexity of the oracles themselves is crucial. This study examines the\\nquantum routines required for the implementation of oracles used in the\\nblock-encoding of the $N \\\\times N$ stiffness and mass matrices, which typically\\nemerge in the finite element analysis of elastic structures. Starting from\\nbasic quantum adders, we show how to construct the necessary oracles, which\\nrequire the calculation of polynomials, square root and the implementation of\\nconditional operations. We propose quantum subroutines based on fixed-point\\narithmetic that, given an $r$-qubit register, construct the oracle using\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}((K + L + N_{\\\\mathrm{geo}} + N_{\\\\mathrm{D}}) r)$ ancilla qubits and\\nhave a $\\\\mathcal{O}((K + L)r^2 + \\\\log_2(N_{\\\\mathrm{geo}} + N_{\\\\mathrm{D}}))$\\nruntime, with $K$ the order at which we truncate the polynomials, $L$ the\\nnumber of iterations in the Newton-Raphson subroutine for the square root,\\nwhile $N_{\\\\mathrm{geo}}$ and $N_{\\\\mathrm{D}}$ are the number of hypercuboids\\nused to approximate the geometry and the boundary, respectively. Since in\\npractice $r$ scales as $r = \\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\log_2 N)$, and assuming that the other\\nparameters are fixed independently of $N$, this shows that the oracles, while\\nstill costly in practice, do not endanger potential polynomial or exponential\\nadvantages in $N$.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:28:31Z\"}"}
