An important question is\\nwhether these observations are in tension with galaxy formation models, and if\\nso how? While comparisons have been made using physical properties (i.e.~black\\nhole mass and accretion rate) inferred from observations, these require the use\\nof SED modelling assumptions, or locally inferred scaling relations, which may\\nbe unjustified, at least in the distant high-redshift Universe. In this work we\\ntake an alternative approach and forward model predictions from the First Light\\nAnd Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES) suite of cosmological\\nhydrodynamical zoom simulations to predict the observable properties of BLAGN.\\nWe achieve this by first coupling \\\\flares\\\\ with the \\\\qsosed\\\\ model to predict\\nthe ionising photon luminosities of high-redshift ($z>5$) AGN. To model the\\nobserved broad H$\\\\alpha$ emission we then assume a constant conversion factor\\nand covering fraction, and the fraction of AGN that have observable\\nbroad-lines. With a reasonable choice of these parameters, \\\\flares\\\\ is able to\\nreproduce observational constraints on the H$\\\\alpha$ luminosity function and\\nequivalent width distribution at $z=5$.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:04:08Z\"}"}
