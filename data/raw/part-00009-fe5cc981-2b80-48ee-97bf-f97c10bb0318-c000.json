{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02549v1\", \"title\": \"Emergent version of Drinfeld's associator equations\", \"summary\": \"The works of Alekseev and Torossian [AT] and Alekseev, Enriquez, and\\nTorossian [AET] show that any solution of Drinfeld's associator equations gives\\nrise to a solution of the Kashiwara-Vergne equations in an explicit way. We\\nintroduce a weak version of Drinfeld's associator equations that we call the\\nemergent version of the original equations. It is shown that solutions to the\\nresulting linearized emergent Drinfeld's equations still lead to solutions to\\nthe linearized Kashiwara-Vergne equations.\\n  The emergent Drinfeld equations arise within a natural topological context of\\nemergent braids, which we discuss. Our results are adjacent to the results of\\nBar-Natan, Dancso, Hogan, Liu and Scherich [BDHLS] on the relationship between\\nemergent tangles and the Goldman-Turaev Lie bialgebra. We hope that in time our\\nresults will play a role in relating several bodies of work, on Drinfeld\\nassociators, Kashiwara-Vergne equations, and on expansions for classical\\ntangles, for w-tangles, and for the Goldman-Turaev Lie bialgebra.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GT\", \"categories\": \"math.GT,math.QA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T13:02:04Z\"}"}
