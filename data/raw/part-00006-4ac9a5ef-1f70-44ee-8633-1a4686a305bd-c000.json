{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12096v1\", \"title\": \"Max-Cut graph-driven quantum circuit design for planar spin glasses\", \"summary\": \"Finding the ground state of spin glasses is a challenging problem with broad\\nimplications. Many hard optimization problems, including NP-complete problems,\\ncan be mapped, for instance, to the Ising spin glass model. We present a\\ngraph-based approach that allows for accurate state initialization of a\\nfrustrated triangular spin-lattice with up to 20 sites that stays away from\\nbarren plateaus. To optimize circuit efficiency and trainability, we employ a\\nclustering strategy that organizes qubits into distinct groups based on the\\nmaximum cut technique, which divides the lattice into two subsets maximally\\ndisconnected. We provide evidence that this Max-Cut-based lattice division\\noffers a robust framework for optimizing circuit design and effectively\\nmodeling frustrated systems at polynomial cost. All simulations are performed\\nwithin the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) formalism, the current\\nparadigm for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ), but can be extended\\nbeyond. Our results underscore the potential of hybrid quantum-classical\\nmethods in addressing complex optimization problems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn,physics.chem-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T14:00:32Z\"}"}
