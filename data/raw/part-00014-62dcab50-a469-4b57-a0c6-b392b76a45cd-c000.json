Special attention is paid to the\\ncomparative analysis of the two views on the problem. It is remarkably that the\\ndivergences, which have the same form in one approach, acquire a different\\nnature in another approach and lead to interesting consequences. A special\\ndeformation of the spectrum is used as regularization.\", \"main_category\": \"math-ph\", \"categories\": \"math-ph,hep-th,math.CA,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T10:22:01Z\"}"}
