{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16790v1\", \"title\": \"Toroidal black holes in four dimensions\", \"summary\": \"From a purely geometric (kinematic) perspective, black holes in four\\ndimensional spacetimes can have event horizons with arbitrary topologies. It is\\nonly when energy conditions are imposed that the horizon's shape is constrained\\nto be spherical. Despite this, exploring exotic horizon topologies remains\\ntheoretically intriguing since it allows to unveil structural aspects of\\nGeneral Relativity and gain intuition on energy condition violations. In the\\naxisymmetric case, besides the well-known spherical topology, only a toroidal\\ntopology is consistent with the symmetry. Complete solutions, describing the\\nentire exterior region of such toroidal black holes without singularities, have\\nnot been reported yet. To the best of our knowledge, the construction we\\npresent here is the first explicit example of a toroidal black hole solution in\\nfour spacetime dimensions that is free of singularities in the external region.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:06:50Z\"}"}
