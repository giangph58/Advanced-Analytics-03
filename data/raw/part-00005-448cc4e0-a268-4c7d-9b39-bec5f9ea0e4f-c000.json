By establishing general conditions for\\nadiabatic evolution between quantum states in parameter space, we derive the\\nessential pulse area and phase conditions necessary for quantum state transfer\\nin a resonant single-$\\\\Lambda$ three-level system. We extend this approach to a\\ndouble-$\\\\Lambda$ four-level system by incorporating a neighboring intermediate\\nstate, which leads to a single-photon detuned $\\\\Lambda$ three-level system.\\nThrough numerical simulations of the ultracold $^{87}$Rb atomic system, we\\ndemonstrate that high-fidelity and robust control of quantum state transfer can\\nbe achieved in the single-$\\\\Lambda$ three-level system using stimulated Raman\\nadiabatic passage (STIRAP) and the pulsed jump protocol. Furthermore, we show\\nthat the destructive quantum interference effects between resonant and detuned\\nRaman pathways in the double-$\\\\Lambda$ four-level system can be mitigated by\\noptimizing the pulse area and two-photon detuning parameters within the pulsed\\njump protocol. This work presents a promising approach for achieving\\nall-optical Raman control of quantum state transfer in ultracold atomic\\nhyperfine states.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T06:30:37Z\"}"}
