The goal of this work is to establish Strichartz estimates for\\n$\\\\mathcal{H}_{\\\\mathbf{A}}$ in this setting. A key aspect of our approach is the\\nconstruction of the Schwartz kernel of the resolvent and the spectral measure\\nfor Schr\\\\\\\"{o}dinger operator on the flat Euclidean cone $(\\\\Sigma, g)$. The\\nresults presented here generalize previous work in \\\\cite{Ford, BFM, FZZ,\\nZhang1}.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:45:19Z\"}"}
