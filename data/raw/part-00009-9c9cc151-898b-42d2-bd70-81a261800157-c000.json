Our NIRSpec data confirms that Phaethon's surface is\\ndehydrated, showing no evidence of hydrated minerals in the 3-$\\\\mu$m region. We\\nestimate an upper limit on the hydrogen content in phyllosilicates of 0.06 wt%.\\nComparisons with laboratory spectra of carbonaceous chondrites suggest that\\nPhaethon's surface composition is best matched by thermally metamorphosed\\nsamples of the CM chondrite Murchison (heated to 1000$^{\\\\circ}$C), rather than\\nCY meteorites as previous work suggested. We find no evidence of ongoing\\nsurface evolution due to recent perihelion passages. A comparison of the\\nmid-infrared spectra of Phaethon and Bennu shows distinct spectral differences\\nthat are consistent with their different thermal histories. Our findings\\nfurther refine our understanding of Phaethon's current surface composition and\\nevolution and provide additional insights for the upcoming DESTINY+ mission.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T17:54:35Z\"}"}
