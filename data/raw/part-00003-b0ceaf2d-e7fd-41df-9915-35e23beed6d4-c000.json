In particular, we show that the\\ndistribution of returns can be cast in a simple scaling form, and that its\\nfunctional form is directly related to the distribution of the volatilities.\\nThis approach explains the presence of power-law tails in the returns as a\\ndirect consequence of the presence of a power law tail in the distribution of\\nvolatilities. It also provides the form of the distribution of Bitcoin returns,\\nwhich behaves as a stretched exponential, as a consequence of the fact that the\\nBitcoin volatilities distribution is also closely described by a stretched\\nexponential. We test our predictions with data from the S\\\\&P 500 index, Apple\\nand Paramount stocks; and Bitcoin.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.ST\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.ST,stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T07:26:20Z\"}"}
