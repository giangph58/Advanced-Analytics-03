To address these challenges, we extend\\nhybrid differential dynamic programming by enhancing with a continuation of\\ndynamical system. The optimization begins with the Sundman-transformed two-body\\nproblem and gradually transitions to the Sundman-transformed circular\\nrestricted three-body problem expressed in the moon-centered inertial frame.\\nNumerical examples demonstrate the robust convergence of our method, where\\noptimal transfers from low lunar orbit to near-rectilinear halo orbit are\\nobtained with a poor initial guess of low lunar orbit.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.IM,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T13:16:13Z\"}"}
