Isolating the solar wind forecasting errors due to these effects is\\ndifficult. This study investigates the uncertainties in solar wind models\\narising from these limitations. We simulate magnetic field maps with known\\nuncertainties, including far-side and polar field variations, as well as\\nresolution and sensitivity limitations. These maps serve as input for three\\nsolar wind models: the Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA), the Heliospheric Upwind\\neXtrapolation (HUXt), and the European Heliospheric FORecasting Information\\nAsset (EUHFORIA). We analyze the discrepancies in solar wind forecasts,\\nparticularly the solar wind speed at Earth's location, by comparing the results\\nof these models to a created \\\"ground truth\\\" magnetic field map, which is\\nderived from a synthetic solar rotation evolution using the Advective Flux\\nTransport (AFT) model. The results reveal significant variations within each\\nmodel with a RMSE ranging from 59-121 km/s. Further comparison with the\\nthermodynamic Magnetohydrodynamic Algorithm outside a Sphere (MAS) model\\nindicates that uncertainties in the magnetic field data can lead to even larger\\nvariations in solar wind forecasts compared to those within a single model.\\nHowever, predicting a range of solar wind velocities based on a cloud of points\\naround Earth can help mitigate uncertainties by up to 20-77%.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T07:27:07Z\"}"}
