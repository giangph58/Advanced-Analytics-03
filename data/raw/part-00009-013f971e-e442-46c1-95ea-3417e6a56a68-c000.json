{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12111v1\", \"title\": \"Optimizing the quantum interference between single photons and local\\n  oscillator with photon correlations\", \"summary\": \"The quantum interference between a coherent state and a single photon is an\\nimportant tool in continuous variable optical quantum technologies to\\ncharacterize and engineer non-Gaussian quantum states. Semiconductor quantum\\ndots, which have recently emerged as a key platform for efficient single-photon\\ngeneration, could become interesting assets in this context. An essential\\nparameter for interfering single photons and classical fields is the mean\\nwavepacket overlap between both fields. Here, we report on two homodyne\\nphoton-correlation techniques enabling the precise measurement of the overlap\\nbetween a single photon generated by a quantum dot-cavity device and pulsed\\nlaser light. The different statistics of interfering fields lead to specific\\nsignatures of the quantum interference on the photon correlations at the output\\nof the interfering beam splitter. We compare the behavior of maximized overlap,\\nmeasuring either the Hong-Ou-Mandel visibility between both outputs or the\\nphoton bunching at a single output. Through careful tailoring of the laser\\nlight in various degrees of freedom, we maximize the overlap to $76\\\\,\\\\%$, with\\nlimitations primarily due to mismatched spectral and temporal profiles and\\nlow-frequency charge noise in the single-photon source.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T14:19:51Z\"}"}
