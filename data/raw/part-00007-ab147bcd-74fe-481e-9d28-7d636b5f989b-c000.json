{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19673v1\", \"title\": \"Generative AI in Education: Student Skills and Lecturer Roles\", \"summary\": \"Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools such as ChatGPT are emerging\\nas a revolutionary tool in education that brings both positive aspects and\\nchallenges for educators and students, reshaping how learning and teaching are\\napproached. This study aims to identify and evaluate the key competencies\\nstudents need to effectively engage with GenAI in education and to provide\\nstrategies for lecturers to integrate GenAI into teaching practices. The study\\napplied a mixed method approach with a combination of a literature review and a\\nquantitative survey involving 130 students from South Asia and Europe to obtain\\nits findings. The literature review identified 14 essential student skills for\\nGenAI engagement, with AI literacy, critical thinking, and ethical AI practices\\nemerging as the most critical. The student survey revealed gaps in prompt\\nengineering, bias awareness, and AI output management. In our study of lecturer\\nstrategies, we identified six key areas, with GenAI Integration and Curriculum\\nDesign being the most emphasised. Our findings highlight the importance of\\nincorporating GenAI into education. While literature prioritized ethics and\\npolicy development, students favour hands-on, project-based learning and\\npractical AI applications. To foster inclusive and responsible GenAI adoption,\\ninstitutions should ensure equitable access to GenAI tools, establish clear\\nacademic integrity policies, and advocate for global GenAI research\\ninitiatives.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T10:58:30Z\"}"}
