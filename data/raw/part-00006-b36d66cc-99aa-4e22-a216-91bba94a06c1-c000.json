We show that the\\nHirsch length, $h(G)$, is equal to the nuclear dimension of its group\\n$C^*$-algebra, $\\\\dim_{nuc}(C^*(G))$. We then specialize our attention to a\\ngeneralization of crystallographic groups dubbed $\\\\textit{crystal-like}$. We\\ndemonstrate that in this scenario a $\\\\textit{point group}$ is well defined and\\nthe order of this point group is preserved by $C^*$-isomorphism. In addition,\\nwe provide a counter-example to $C^*$-superrigidity within this crystal-like\\nsetting.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OA\", \"categories\": \"math.OA,math.GR,math.RT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T15:19:25Z\"}"}
