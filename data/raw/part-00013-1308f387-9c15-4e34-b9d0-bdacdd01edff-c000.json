{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19875v1\", \"title\": \"Fiber laser based stimulated Raman photothermal microscopy with long\\n  working distance optics\", \"summary\": \"Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy is a highly sensitive chemical\\nimaging technique. However, the broader application of SRS has been limited by\\ntwo key challenges: the reliance on low-noise but bulky solid-state laser\\nsources and stringent sample requirements necessitated by high numerical\\naperture (NA) optics. Here, we present a fiber laser based stimulated Raman\\nphotothermal (SRP) microscope that addresses these limitations. While\\nappreciating the portability and compactness of a noisy source, fiber laser SRP\\nenables a two-order-of-magnitude improvement in signal to noise ratio over\\nfiber laser SRS without balance detection. Furthermore, with the use of low NA,\\nlong working distance optics for signal collection, SRP expands the allowed\\nsample space from millimeters to centimeters, which diversifies the sample\\nformats to multi-well plates and thick tissues. The sensitivity and imaging\\ndepth are further amplified by using urea for both thermal enhancement and\\ntissue clearance. Together, fiber laser SRP microscopy provides a robust,\\nuser-friendly platform for diverse applications.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,physics.ins-det\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:05:58Z\"}"}
