Here, we propose two wireless transfer schemes with\\nparity-time symmetries to efficiently extract the energy stored in\\nnon-Hermitian QBs to consumption centers. For linear cases, the transfer energy\\noscillates periodically in the unbroken symmetry region and grows\\nhyperbolically in the broken region. For nonlinear cases, the transfer energy\\neventually reach and remain steady-state values arising from the feedback\\nmechanism of the nonlinear saturable gain. Furthermore, we show the significant\\nrobustness and the ultrafast response of the wireless transfer schemes to\\nsudden movements around one metre. Our work overcomes energy bottlenecks for\\nwireless transfer schemes in QBs and may provide inspirations for practical\\napplications of QBs.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T13:24:31Z\"}"}
