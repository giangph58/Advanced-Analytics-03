{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07063v1\", \"title\": \"Non-Gaussianity of Tensor Induced Density Perturbations\", \"summary\": \"We investigate the non-Gaussianity of second-order matter density\\nperturbations induced by primordial gravitational waves (GWs). These\\ntensor-induced scalar modes arise from local fluctuations in the GWs energy\\ndensity, which is quadratic in tensor perturbations. The resulting second-order\\ndensity contrast follows a chi-squared distribution, naturally exhibiting\\nsignificant non-Gaussianity. We compute the bispectrum of these tensor-induced\\nscalar modes and analyze its dependence on various primordial GWs power\\nspectra, including scale-invariant, blue-tilted, Gaussian-bump, and\\nmonochromatic sources. We find that the bispectrum shape is inherently\\nsensitive to the underlying GWs spectrum by construction. In particular,\\nGaussian-bump and monochromatic sources produce a strong signal peaking in the\\nequilateral configuration, similar to the effect of scalar-induced tensor\\nmodes. Our findings reveal a new way to probe primordial GWs via galaxy surveys\\nand highlight a unique feature of tensor-induced density perturbations,\\notherwise mimicking linear ones on sub-horizon scales.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T17:26:41Z\"}"}
