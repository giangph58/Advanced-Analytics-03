Specifically,\\nwater surface object detection faces challenges from blurred edges and diverse\\nobject scales. Although vision-radar fusion offers a feasible solution,\\nexisting approaches suffer from cross-modal feature conflicts, which negatively\\naffect model robustness. To address this problem, we propose a robust\\nvision-radar fusion model WS-DETR. In particular, we first introduce a\\nMulti-Scale Edge Information Integration (MSEII) module to enhance edge\\nperception and a Hierarchical Feature Aggregator (HiFA) to boost multi-scale\\nobject detection in the encoder. Then, we adopt self-moving point\\nrepresentations for continuous convolution and residual connection to\\nefficiently extract irregular features under the scenarios of irregular point\\ncloud data. To further mitigate cross-modal conflicts, an Adaptive Feature\\nInteractive Fusion (AFIF) module is introduced to integrate visual and radar\\nfeatures through geometric alignment and semantic fusion. Extensive experiments\\non the WaterScenes dataset demonstrate that WS-DETR achieves state-of-the-art\\n(SOTA) performance, maintaining its superiority even under adverse weather and\\nlighting conditions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T04:16:46Z\"}"}
