{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17307v1\", \"title\": \"An Extensible Software Transport Layer for GPU Networking\", \"summary\": \"Fast-evolving machine learning (ML) workloads have increasing requirements\\nfor networking. However, host network transport on RDMA NICs is hard to evolve,\\ncausing problems for ML workloads. For example, single-path RDMA traffic is\\nprone to flow collisions that severely degrade collective communication\\nperformance. We present UCCL, an extensible software transport layer to evolve\\nGPU networking. UCCL decouples the data path and control path of existing RDMA\\nNICs and efficiently runs the control-path transport on host CPUs. This\\nsoftware extensibility brings in transport innovations that cannot be achieved\\nin hardware for ML workloads, e.g., a multipath transport to resolve flow\\ncollisions. ML collectives atop UCCL achieve up to 3.3x higher performance\\ncompared to an industry solution.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T07:01:44Z\"}"}
