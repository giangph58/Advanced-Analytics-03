This resolves a recent question about the\\nrelationship between probabilistic and universal satisfaction of group\\nidentities. Our construction uses $n$-periodic products of cyclic groups of\\norder $n$ and two-generator relatively free groups satisfying identities of the\\nform $[x^{pn}, y^{pn}]^n = 1$. We prove that in each of these products, the\\nprobability of satisfying $x^n = 1$ is equal to 1, despite the fact that the\\nidentity does not hold throughout any of these groups.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GR\", \"categories\": \"math.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T09:45:03Z\"}"}
