However,\\nconventional methods that calculate stress fields from velocity fields struggle\\nto measure complex fluids where the stress constitutive equation is unknown. To\\naddress this, we propose a novel approach that combines photoelastic\\nmeasurements -- which can non-invasively visualize internal stresses -- with\\nmachine learning to measure stress fields. The machine learning model, which we\\nnamed physics-informed convolutional encoder-decoder (PICED), integrates a\\nconvolutional neural network (CNN)-based encoder-decoder model with a\\nphysics-informed neural network (PINN). Using this approach, three-dimensional\\nstress fields can be predicted with high accuracy for multiple interpolated\\ndata points in a rectangular channel flow.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T14:48:24Z\"}"}
