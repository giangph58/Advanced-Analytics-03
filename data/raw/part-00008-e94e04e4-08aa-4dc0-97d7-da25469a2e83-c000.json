However, domain generalization (DG) research has\\nprimarily focused on convolutional neural network (CNN)-based detectors, while\\npaying little attention to enhancing the robustness of DETRs. In this letter,\\nwe introduce a Domain Generalized DEtection TRansformer (DG-DETR), a simple,\\neffective, and plug-and-play method that improves out-of-distribution (OOD)\\nrobustness for DETRs. Specifically, we propose a novel domain-agnostic query\\nselection strategy that removes domain-induced biases from object queries via\\northogonal projection onto the instance-specific style space. Additionally, we\\nleverage a wavelet decomposition to disentangle features into domain-invariant\\nand domain-specific components, enabling synthesis of diverse latent styles\\nwhile preserving the semantic features of objects. Experimental results\\nvalidate the effectiveness of DG-DETR.
