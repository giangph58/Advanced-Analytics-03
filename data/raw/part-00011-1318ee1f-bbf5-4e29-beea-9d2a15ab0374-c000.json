{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21780v1\", \"title\": \"MAGNET: an open-source library for mesh agglomeration by Graph Neural\\n  Networks\", \"summary\": \"We introduce MAGNET, an open-source Python library designed for mesh\\nagglomeration in both two- and three-dimensions, based on employing Graph\\nNeural Networks (GNN). MAGNET serves as a comprehensive solution for training a\\nvariety of GNN models, integrating deep learning and other advanced algorithms\\nsuch as METIS and k-means to facilitate mesh agglomeration and quality metric\\ncomputation. The library's introduction is outlined through its code structure\\nand primary features. The GNN framework adopts a graph bisection methodology\\nthat capitalizes on connectivity and geometric mesh information via SAGE\\nconvolutional layers, in line with the methodology proposed by Antonietti et\\nal. (2024). Additionally, the proposed MAGNET library incorporates\\nreinforcement learning to enhance the accuracy and robustness of the model for\\npredicting coarse partitions within a multilevel framework. A detailed tutorial\\nis provided to guide the user through the process of mesh agglomeration and the\\ntraining of a GNN bisection model. We present several examples of mesh\\nagglomeration conducted by MAGNET, demonstrating the library's applicability\\nacross various scenarios. Furthermore, the performance of the newly introduced\\nmodels is contrasted with that of METIS and k-means, illustrating that the\\nproposed GNN models are competitive regarding partition quality and\\ncomputational efficiency. Finally, we exhibit the versatility of MAGNET's\\ninterface through its integration with Lymph, an open-source library\\nimplementing discontinuous Galerkin methods on polytopal grids for the\\nnumerical discretization of multiphysics differential problems.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.MS,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T16:33:22Z\"}"}
