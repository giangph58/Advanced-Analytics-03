{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05203v1\", \"title\": \"LAPSO: A Unified Optimization View for Learning-Augmented Power System\\n  Operations\", \"summary\": \"With the high penetration of renewables, traditional model-based power system\\noperation is challenged to deliver economic, stable, and robust decisions.\\nMachine learning has emerged as a powerful modeling tool for capturing complex\\ndynamics to address these challenges. However, its separate design often lacks\\nsystematic integration with existing methods. To fill the gap, this paper\\nproposes a holistic framework of Learning-Augmented Power System Operations\\n(LAPSO, pronounced as Lap-So). Adopting a native optimization perspective,\\nLAPSO is centered on the operation stage and aims to break the boundary between\\ntemporally siloed power system tasks, such as forecast, operation and control,\\nwhile unifying the objectives of machine learning and model-based optimizations\\nat both training and inference stages. Systematic analysis and simulations\\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of applying LAPSO in designing new integrated\\nalgorithms, such as stability-constrained optimization (SCO) and\\nobjective-based forecasting (OBF), while enabling end-to-end tracing of\\ndifferent sources of uncertainties. In addition, a dedicated Python\\npackage-lapso is introduced to automatically augment existing power system\\noptimization models with learnable components.
