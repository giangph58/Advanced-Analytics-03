The main features of the corresponding cosmological\\nscenarios are determined. In many cases, we identify a transition from\\ndecelerated to accelerated regimes. The properties of the self-interacting\\nscalar field, including the corresponding potential, are determined. Finally,\\nsome possible realistic configurations are analyzed.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.CO,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T13:16:11Z\"}"}
