{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20018v1\", \"title\": \"MINT: Multi-Vector Search Index Tuning\", \"summary\": \"Vector search plays a crucial role in many real-world applications. In\\naddition to single-vector search, multi-vector search becomes important for\\nmulti-modal and multi-feature scenarios today. In a multi-vector database, each\\nrow is an item, each column represents a feature of items, and each cell is a\\nhigh-dimensional vector. In multi-vector databases, the choice of indexes can\\nhave a significant impact on performance. Although index tuning for relational\\ndatabases has been extensively studied, index tuning for multi-vector search\\nremains unclear and challenging. In this paper, we define multi-vector search\\nindex tuning and propose a framework to solve it. Specifically, given a\\nmulti-vector search workload, we develop algorithms to find indexes that\\nminimize latency and meet storage and recall constraints. Compared to the\\nbaseline, our latency achieves 2.1X to 8.3X speedup.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DB\", \"categories\": \"cs.DB,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:36:06Z\"}"}
