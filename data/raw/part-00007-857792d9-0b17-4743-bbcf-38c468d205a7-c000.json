{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10156v1\", \"title\": \"The missing elements in the telegraph equations\", \"summary\": \"The conventional modeling of transmission lines relies on the classical\\ntelegraph equations, originally formulated over 150 years ago. These equations\\nare typically derived by representing the line as an assembly of infinitesimal\\ninductive, capacitive, and resistive elements. However, this formulation is\\nfundamentally flawed, as a transmission line cannot be accurately described\\nthrough a discretized model of infinitesimal lumped components. Instead, a more\\nrigorous approach should derive the governing equations directly from Maxwells\\nequations in conjunction with Ohms law. This paper presents such a derivation\\nand introduces a corrected formulation, herein referred to as the Trump\\nEquations.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.gen-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.gen-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T12:12:43Z\"}"}
