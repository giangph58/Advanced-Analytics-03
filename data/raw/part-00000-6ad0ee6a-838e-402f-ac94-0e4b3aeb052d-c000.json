{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24140v1\", \"title\": \"Reinforcement Learning for Safe Autonomous Two Device Navigation of\\n  Cerebral Vessels in Mechanical Thrombectomy\", \"summary\": \"Purpose: Autonomous systems in mechanical thrombectomy (MT) hold promise for\\nreducing procedure times, minimizing radiation exposure, and enhancing patient\\nsafety. However, current reinforcement learning (RL) methods only reach the\\ncarotid arteries, are not generalizable to other patient vasculatures, and do\\nnot consider safety. We propose a safe dual-device RL algorithm that can\\nnavigate beyond the carotid arteries to cerebral vessels.\\n  Methods: We used the Simulation Open Framework Architecture to represent the\\nintricacies of cerebral vessels, and a modified Soft Actor-Critic RL algorithm\\nto learn, for the first time, the navigation of micro-catheters and\\nmicro-guidewires. We incorporate patient safety metrics into our reward\\nfunction by integrating guidewire tip forces. Inverse RL is used with\\ndemonstrator data on 12 patient-specific vascular cases.\\n  Results: Our simulation demonstrates successful autonomous navigation within\\nunseen cerebral vessels, achieving a 96% success rate, 7.0s procedure time, and\\n0.24 N mean forces, well below the proposed 1.5 N vessel rupture threshold.\\n  Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, our proposed autonomous system for\\nMT two-device navigation reaches cerebral vessels, considers safety, and is\\ngeneralizable to unseen patient-specific cases for the first time. We envisage\\nfuture work will extend the validation to vasculatures of different complexity\\nand on in vitro models. While our contributions pave the way towards deploying\\nagents in clinical settings, safety and trustworthiness will be crucial\\nelements to consider when proposing new methodology.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:25:46Z\"}"}
