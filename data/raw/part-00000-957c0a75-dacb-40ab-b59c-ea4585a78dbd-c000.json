There is a need for controlled, probing evaluations with real\\nstakeholders which can highlight advantages and disadvantages of more\\ntraditional architectures and those based on generative AI. We present a\\nwithin-group user study to compare two versions of a conversational assistant\\nthat allows heart failure patients to ask about salt content in food. One\\nversion of the system was developed in-house with a neurosymbolic architecture,\\nand one is based on ChatGPT. The evaluation shows that the in-house system is\\nmore accurate, completes more tasks and is less verbose than the one based on\\nChatGPT; on the other hand, the one based on ChatGPT makes fewer speech errors\\nand requires fewer clarifications to complete the task. Patients show no\\npreference for one over the other.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T17:16:24Z\"}"}
