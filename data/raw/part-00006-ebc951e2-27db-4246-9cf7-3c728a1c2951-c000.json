{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07663v1\", \"title\": \"Multiplicative assignment with upgrades\", \"summary\": \"We study a problem related to submodular function optimization and the exact\\nmatching problem for which we show a rather peculiar status: its natural\\nLP-relaxation can have fractional optimal vertices, but there is always also an\\noptimal integral vertex, which we can also compute in polynomial time.\\n  More specifically, we consider the multiplicative assignment problem with\\nupgrades in which we are given a set of customers and suppliers and we seek to\\nassign each customer to a different supplier. Each customer has a demand and\\neach supplier has a regular and an upgraded cost for each unit demand provided\\nto the respective assigned client. Our goal is to upgrade at most $k$ suppliers\\nand to compute an assignment in order to minimize the total resulting cost.\\nThis can be cast as the problem to compute an optimal matching in a bipartite\\ngraph with the additional constraint that we must select $k$ edges from a\\ncertain group of edges, similar to selecting $k$ red edges in the exact\\nmatching problem. Also, selecting the suppliers to be upgraded corresponds to\\nmaximizing a submodular set function under a cardinality constraint.\\n  Our result yields an efficient LP-based algorithm to solve our problem\\noptimally. In addition, we provide also a purely strongly polynomial-time\\nalgorithm for it. As an application, we obtain exact algorithms for the\\nupgrading variant of the problem to schedule jobs on identical or uniformly\\nrelated machines in order to minimize their sum of completion times, i.e.,\\nwhere we may upgrade up to $k$ jobs to reduce their respective processing\\ntimes.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS,cs.DM,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T11:25:29Z\"}"}
