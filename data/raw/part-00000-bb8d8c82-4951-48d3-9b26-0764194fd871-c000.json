Existing methods inadequately\\nleverage information from different modalities, primarily focusing on digging\\ndistinguishing features from modality-shared information while neglecting\\nmodality-specific details. To fully utilize differentiated minutiae, we propose\\na Base-Detail Feature Learning Framework (BDLF) that enhances the learning of\\nboth base and detail knowledge, thereby capitalizing on both modality-shared\\nand modality-specific information. Specifically, the proposed BDLF mines detail\\nand base features through a lossless detail feature extraction module and a\\ncomplementary base embedding generation mechanism, respectively, supported by a\\nnovel correlation restriction method that ensures the features gained by BDLF\\nenrich both detail and base knowledge across VIS and IR features. Comprehensive\\nexperiments conducted on the SYSU-MM01, RegDB, and LLCM datasets validate the\\neffectiveness of BDLF.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:14:07Z\"}"}
