{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04295v1\", \"title\": \"Probing millicharged particles with NA64$\\u03bc$ and LDMX\", \"summary\": \"Millicharged particles emerge as compelling candidates in numerous\\ntheoretically well-motivated extensions of the Standard Model. These\\nhypothetical particles, characterized by an electric charge that is a small\\nfraction of the elementary charge, have attracted significant attention in\\ncontemporary experimental physics. Their potential existence motivates\\ndedicated search strategies across multiple experimental platforms, leveraging\\ntheir distinctive electromagnetic interactions while evading conventional\\ndetection methods. In the present paper we estimated the projected sensitivity\\nof fixed-target experiments - specifically NA64$\\\\mu$ and LDMX - to the\\nparameter space of millicharged particles. For the NA64$\\\\mu$ experiment, with\\nan anticipated muon flux of $\\\\mbox{MOT}\\\\simeq 10^{14}$, our analysis reveals a\\ndetectable mass window of $10~\\\\mbox{MeV} \\\\lesssim m_\\\\chi \\\\lesssim\\n150~\\\\mbox{MeV}$ and charge parameter range $10^{-4} \\\\lesssim \\\\epsilon \\\\lesssim\\n7\\\\times 10^{-4}$. This sensitivity arises from the bremsstrahlung-like missing\\nenergy signature $\\\\mu N \\\\to \\\\mu N \\\\gamma^{*}( \\\\to \\\\chi \\\\bar{\\\\chi})$.\\nFurthermore, we evaluate the discovery potential of the LDMX facility,\\nconsidering its projected electron beam statistics ($\\\\mbox{EOT}\\\\simeq 2\\\\times\\n10^{16}$) and energy ($E_{\\\\rm e}\\\\simeq 8~\\\\mbox{GeV}$). Our results demonstrate\\nthat LDMX can probe heavier MCPs in the mass range $250~\\\\mbox{MeV} \\\\lesssim\\nm_\\\\chi \\\\lesssim 400 ~\\\\mbox{MeV}$, with sensitivities reaching $10^{-3} \\\\lesssim\\n\\\\epsilon \\\\lesssim 1.5 \\\\times 10^{-3}$. This parametric window can be accessible\\nthrough the distinctive invisible decay channel $\\\\rho \\\\to \\\\chi \\\\bar{\\\\chi}$,\\nwhere $\\\\rho$-meson photo-production $\\\\gamma N \\\\to N \\\\rho$ plays a pivotal role.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T10:06:29Z\"}"}
