{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05124v1\", \"title\": \"Proper partial linear spaces affording imprimitive rank 3 automorphism\\n  groups\", \"summary\": \"A partial linear space is a point--line incidence structure such that each\\nline is incident with at least two points and each pair of points is incident\\nwith at most one line. It is said to be proper if there exists at least one\\nnon-collinear point pair, and at least one line incident with more than two\\npoints. The highest degree of symmetry for a proper partial linear space occurs\\nwhen the automorphism group $G$ is transitive on ordered pairs of collinear\\npoints, and on ordered pairs of non-collinear points, that is to say, $G$ is a\\ntransitive rank $3$ group on the points. While the primitive rank 3 partial\\nlinear spaces are essentially classified, we present the first substantial\\nclassification of a family of imprimitive rank $3$ examples. We classify all\\nimprimitive rank $3$ proper partial linear spaces such that the rank $3$ group\\nis semiprimitive and induces an almost simple group on the unique nontrivial\\nsystem of imprimitivity. In particular, this includes all partial linear spaces\\nwith a rank 3 imprimitive automorphism group that is innately transitive or\\nquasiprimitive. We construct several infinite families of examples and ten\\nindividual examples. The examples admit a rank $3$ action of a linear or\\nunitary group, and to our knowledge most of our examples have not appeared\\nbefore in the literature.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GR\", \"categories\": \"math.GR,math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T10:56:58Z\"}"}
