Around 150~K, the field\\ninduced response changes from discrete switching, governed by field-driven\\ndomain propagation, to a collective rotation of the magnetic layers. This\\ntransition is accompanied by a change in the magnetic ground state from\\n180$^{\\\\circ}$ (antiferromagnetic) to 90$^{\\\\circ}$ alignment between adjacent Fe\\nlayers. These effects are argued to arise from quantum well states, defined by\\nthe total thickness of the samples.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T11:22:17Z\"}"}
