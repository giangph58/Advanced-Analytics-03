{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04561v1\", \"title\": \"From Flowers to Fascism? The Cottagecore to Tradwife Pipeline on Tumblr\", \"summary\": \"In this work we collected and analyzed social media posts to investigate\\naesthetic-based radicalization where users searching for Cottagecore content\\nmay find Tradwife content co-opted by white supremacists, white nationalists,\\nor other far-right extremist groups. Through quantitative analysis of over\\n200,000 Tumblr posts and qualitative coding of about 2,500 Tumblr posts, we did\\nnot find evidence of a explicit radicalization. We found that problematic\\nTradwife posts found in the literature may be confined to Tradwife-only spaces,\\nwhile content in the Cottagecore tag generally did not warrant extra\\nmoderation. However, we did find evidence of a mainstreaming effect in the\\noverlap between the Tradwife and Cottagecore communities. In our qualitative\\nanalysis there was more interaction between queer and Tradwife identities than\\nexpected based on the literature, and some Tradwives even explicitly included\\nqueer people and disavowed racism in the Tradwife community on Tumblr. This\\ncould be genuine, but more likely it was an example of extremists re-branding\\ntheir content and following platform norms to spread ideologies that would\\notherwise be rejected by Tumblr users. Additionally, through temporal analysis\\nwe observed a change in the central tags used by Tradwives in the Cottagecore\\ntag pre- and post- 2021. Initially these posts focused on aesthetics and\\nhobbies like baking and gardening, but post-2021 the central tags focused more\\non religion, traditional gender roles, and homesteading, all markers of\\nreactionary ideals.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SI\", \"categories\": \"cs.SI,cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T16:50:58Z\"}"}
