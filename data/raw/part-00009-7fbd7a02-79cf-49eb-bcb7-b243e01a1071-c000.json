The method\\nconsists of an adaptive readout sequence conditioned on each check qubit's\\nreadout result from the previous cycle. For readout errors and\\nmeasurement-induced leakage that are stronger in a particular qubit state, this\\nfeedforward protocol can suppress the physical qubit errors. Focusing on a\\nsimple realization of conditionally flipping (by an X gate) the state of check\\nqubits before their measurement, we investigate the effect of such\\nstate-dependent errors using simulations in the setup of a low-density parity\\ncheck code. We show that the suggested protocol can reduce both logical errors\\nand decoding time, two important aspects of fault-tolerant quantum\\ncomputations.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T16:50:26Z\"}"}
