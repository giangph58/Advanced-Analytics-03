We demonstrate that\\nthe spin entanglement of the system can increase following the decays B to b +\\nM and Bbar to bbar + Mbar, where b and bbar are spin-1/2 baryons and M, Mbar\\nare spin-0 mesons. This phenomenon, known as entanglement autodistillation,\\nrepresents a probabilistic amplification of entanglement during the decay\\nprocess. We analyze the underlying mechanism and show that it depends only on\\nthe initial state of the BBbar system and the decay parameter alphaD, but not\\non the phase parameter phiD.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T11:27:09Z\"}"}
