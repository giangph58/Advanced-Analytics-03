We apply the non-uniform L1 formula and\\ninterpolation quadrature to discretize the fractional derivative and the memory\\nterm, respectively, and then adopt the complementary discrete convolution\\nkernel approach to prove the stability and first-order temporal accuracy of the\\nscheme. The main difficulty in numerical analysis lies in the non-positivity of\\nthe kernel and its coupling with the complementary discrete convolution kernel\\n(such that different model exponents are also coupled), and the results extend\\nthose in [Chen, Thom\\\\'ee and Wahlbin, Math. Comp. 1992] to the subdiffusive\\ncase. Numerical experiments are performed to substantiate the theoretical\\nresults.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T03:46:20Z\"}"}
