{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04377v1\", \"title\": \"Large Deviations and the Peano Phenomenon in Stochastic Differential\\n  Equations with Homogeneous Drift\", \"summary\": \"We consider a diffusion equation in $\\\\R^d$ with drift equal to the gradient\\nof a homogeneous potential of degree $1+\\\\gamma$, with $0<\\\\gamma<1$, and local\\nvariance equal to $\\\\ve^2$ with $\\\\ve\\\\to0$. The associated deterministic system\\nfor $\\\\ve=0$ has a potential that is not a Lipschitz function at the origin.\\nTherefore, an infinite number of solutions exist, known as the Peano\\nphenomenon. In this work, we study large deviations of first and second order\\nfor the system with noise, generalizing previous results for the particular\\npotential $b(x)=x |x|^{\\\\gamma-1}$. For the first-order large deviations, we\\nrecover the rate function from the well-known Freidlin-Wentzell work. For the\\nsecond-order large deviation, we use a refinement of Carmona-Simon bounds for\\nthe eigenfunctions of a Schr\\\\\\\"odinger operator and prove that the exponential\\nbehavior of the process depends only on the ground state of such an operator.\\nMoreover, a refined study of the ground state allows us to obtain the large\\ndeviation rate function explicitly and to deduce that the family of diffusions\\nconverges to the set of extreme solutions of the deterministic system.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T12:57:45Z\"}"}
