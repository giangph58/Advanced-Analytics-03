We\\npropose an integrated control framework for SaR robots in dynamic, uncertain\\nenvironments, including a computationally efficient heuristic motion planning\\nsystem that provides a nominal (assuming there are no uncertainties)\\ncollision-free trajectory for SaR robots and a robust motion tracking system\\nthat steers the robot to track this reference trajectory, taking into account\\nthe impact of uncertainties. The control architecture guarantees a balanced\\ntrade-off among various SaR objectives, while handling the hard constraints,\\nincluding safety. The results of various computer-based simulations, presented\\nin this paper, showed significant out-performance (of up to 42.3%) of the\\nproposed integrated control architecture compared to two commonly used\\nstate-of-the-art methods (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree and Artificial\\nPotential Function) in reaching targets (e.g., trapped victims in SaR) safely,\\ncollision-free, and in the shortest possible time.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:10:02Z\"}"}
