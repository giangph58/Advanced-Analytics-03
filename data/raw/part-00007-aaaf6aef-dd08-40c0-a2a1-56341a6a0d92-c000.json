The\\napproach relies on the second eigenvalue's minimax properties, but the actual\\nlimiting eigenvalue depends on the choice of initial function. The\\nwell-posedness and convergence of the iterative scheme are proved. Moreover, we\\nprovide the corresponding numerical computations. As auxiliary results, which\\nalso have an independent interest, we provide several properties of certain\\n$p$-Poisson problems.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,cs.NA,math.NA,math.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T10:52:42Z\"}"}
