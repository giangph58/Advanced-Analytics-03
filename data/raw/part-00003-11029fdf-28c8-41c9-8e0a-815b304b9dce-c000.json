{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17319v1\", \"title\": \"Machine Learning-Based Design and Monte Carlo Simulation of a Neutron\\n  Beam Shutter for Cyclotron-Based Neutron Sources\", \"summary\": \"This study proposes a novel design methodology for neutron beam shutters that\\nintegrates Monte Carlo simulations (MCNP) with machine learning techniques to\\nenhance shielding performance and accelerate the design process. The target\\nfacility is a compact neutron science platform where neutrons are produced by\\nproton beams from a cyclotron striking a neutron production target. The system\\nincludes both thermal and fast neutron beamlines. A beam shutter is installed\\non the thermal neutron line to reduce occupational radiation exposure during\\nmaintenance activities.\\n  In this work, 200 neutron shutter configurations with varying material\\nsequences were simulated using MCNP. The resulting dataset was used to train a\\nfully connected neural network to predict the neutron flux downstream of the\\nshielding. The trained model was subsequently applied to 1,000 randomly\\ngenerated shielding configurations for rapid flux prediction and performance\\nranking. The 20 designs with the lowest predicted flux were selected and\\nfurther validated via MCNP simulations.\\n  Results show that the optimal design reduces the neutron flux from 5.61 x\\n10^9 n/cm2*s at the shutter entrance to 4.96 x 10^5 n/cm2*s at the exit,\\nachieving a reduction of four orders of magnitude. These findings confirm that\\nthe integration of machine learning techniques can effectively reduce\\nsimulation costs and assist in identifying high-performance shielding\\nconfigurations, demonstrating the strong potential of data driven approaches in\\nneutron system design.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T07:21:25Z\"}"}
