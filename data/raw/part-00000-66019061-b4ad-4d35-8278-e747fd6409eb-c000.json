{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16820v1\", \"title\": \"Symmetric Proofs in the Ideal Proof System\", \"summary\": \"We consider the Ideal Proof System (IPS) introduced by Grochow and Pitassi\\nand pose the question of which tautologies admit symmetric proofs, and of what\\ncomplexity. The symmetry requirement in proofs is inspired by recent work\\nestablishing lower bounds in other symmetric models of computation. We link the\\nexistence of symmetric IPS proofs to the expressive power of logics such as\\nfixed-point logic with counting and Choiceless Polynomial Time, specifically\\nregarding the graph isomorphism problem. We identify relationships and\\ntradeoffs between the symmetry of proofs and other parameters of IPS proofs\\nsuch as size, degree and linearity. We study these on a number of standard\\nfamilies of tautologies from proof complexity and finite model theory such as\\nthe pigeonhole principle, the subset sum problem and the Cai-F\\\\\\\"urer-Immerman\\ngraphs, exhibiting non-trivial upper bounds on the size of symmetric IPS\\nproofs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LO\", \"categories\": \"cs.LO,cs.CC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:38:05Z\"}"}
