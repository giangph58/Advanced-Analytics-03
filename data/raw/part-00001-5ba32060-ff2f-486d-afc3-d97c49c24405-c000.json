Polycrystalline samples were synthesized\\nusing S raw materials of different purities (2N or 6N), and single-crystalline\\nsamples were grown using two types of transport agents (2NH4Cl+PbCl2 or NH4Cl)\\nvia the chemical vapor transport method. The temperature dependence on\\nresistivity dropped at 1.3-2.0 K for some of the samples, which might be\\naffected by the unknown impurity. (LaS)1+d(NbS2) misfit-layered compounds for\\nthe main phase of those obtained samples exhibited no superconductivity above\\n0.2 K by the resistivity measurement.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T02:01:38Z\"}"}
