{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19655v1\", \"title\": \"Oscillation death by mechanochemical feedback\", \"summary\": \"Many cellular proteins, such as ERK, undergo oscillation death when cells are\\ncompressed, initiating many developmental processes in organisms. Whether such\\na transition arises from these proteins' specific biochemistry or generic\\ndynamical features remains unclear. In this paper, we show that coupling\\nmechanics to the chemistry of Hopf oscillators, such as ERK, through\\nmechanochemical feedback (MCF) can generically drive oscillation death upon\\ncompression. We demonstrate this result using an active solid, a 1D ring of\\nBrusselators coupled through damped springs, which we term Harmonic Brusselator\\nRing (HBR). Because of MCF, HBR's dynamics is non-Hermitian and breaks\\n$\\\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry in a scale-dependent manner, generating a rich array of\\npatterns, including traveling pulses, chimera states, intermittent\\nfluctuations, and collective oscillation death. Furthermore, MCF engenders\\nthree dynamic phase transitions that separate the observed patterns into four\\nphases. The underlying symmetry of HBR implies that the observed patterns and\\nphases may generically arise in many natural and synthetic systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,cond-mat.stat-mech,nlin.PS,physics.bio-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T10:17:17Z\"}"}
