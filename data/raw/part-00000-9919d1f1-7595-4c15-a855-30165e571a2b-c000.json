{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12292v1\", \"title\": \"SHeaP: Self-Supervised Head Geometry Predictor Learned via 2D Gaussians\", \"summary\": \"Accurate, real-time 3D reconstruction of human heads from monocular images\\nand videos underlies numerous visual applications. As 3D ground truth data is\\nhard to come by at scale, previous methods have sought to learn from abundant\\n2D videos in a self-supervised manner. Typically, this involves the use of\\ndifferentiable mesh rendering, which is effective but faces limitations. To\\nimprove on this, we propose SHeaP (Self-supervised Head Geometry Predictor\\nLearned via 2D Gaussians). Given a source image, we predict a 3DMM mesh and a\\nset of Gaussians that are rigged to this mesh. We then reanimate this rigged\\nhead avatar to match a target frame, and backpropagate photometric losses to\\nboth the 3DMM and Gaussian prediction networks. We find that using Gaussians\\nfor rendering substantially improves the effectiveness of this self-supervised\\napproach. Training solely on 2D data, our method surpasses existing\\nself-supervised approaches in geometric evaluations on the NoW benchmark for\\nneutral faces and a new benchmark for non-neutral expressions. Our method also\\nproduces highly expressive meshes, outperforming state-of-the-art in emotion\\nclassification.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T17:55:02Z\"}"}
