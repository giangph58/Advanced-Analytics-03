Being inaccessible under any other stimuli, such phases are\\nindispensable for unveiling mechanisms and controlling the transitions. We\\nexperimentally explore spin kinetics during ultrafast first-order 90$^{\\\\circ}$\\nspin-reorientation (SR) transition in a canted antiferromagnet Fe$_3$BO$_6$,\\nand reveal that the transition is controlled by the canting between the\\nmagnetic sublattices. Laser-induced perturbation of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\\ninteraction results in a change of the intersublattice canting within first\\npicoseconds, bringing Fe$_3$BO$_6$ to a hidden phase. Once this phase emerges,\\nlaser-induced heating activates precessional 90$^\\\\circ$ spin switching.\\nCombination of the spin canting and heating controls the final spin\\nconfiguration comprising coexisting initial and switched phases. Extended phase\\ncoexistence range is in a striking contrast to the narrow SR transition in\\nFe$_3$BO$_6$ induced by conventional heating.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T13:27:46Z\"}"}
