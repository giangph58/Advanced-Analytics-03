In this\\npaper, we derive the worst-case and best-case bounds for marginal expected\\nshortfall (MES) -- a key measure of systemic risk contribution -- under the\\nassumption of known marginal distributions for individual companies' risks but\\nan unknown dependence structure. We further derive improved bounds for the MES\\nrisk measure when partial information on companies' risk exposures -- and hence\\ntheir dependence -- is available. To capture this partial information, we\\nutilize three commonly used background risk models: the additive,\\nminimum-based, and multiplicative factor models. Finally, we present an\\nalternative set of improved MES bounds based on a linear regression\\nrelationship between individual companies' risks and overall market risk,\\nconsistent with the assumptions of the Capital Asset Pricing Model in finance\\nand the Weighted Insurance Pricing Model in insurance.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.RM\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.RM,math.ST,stat.AP,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:23:53Z\"}"}
