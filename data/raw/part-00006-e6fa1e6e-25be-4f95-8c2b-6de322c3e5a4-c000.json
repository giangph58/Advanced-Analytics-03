One of the main novelties\\nis that we follow for the first time a bifurcation approach, relying on a\\nLyapunov-Schmidt reduction and some recent global bifurcation results, that\\nallows us to study the local and global structure of non-trivial solutions at\\nbifurcation points where the linearized operator has a two-dimensional kernel.\\nIndeed, at such points the classical tools in bifurcation theory, like the\\nCrandall-Rabinowitz theorem or some generalizations of it, cannot be applied\\nbecause the multiplicity of the eigenvalues is not odd, and a new approach is\\nrequired. We apply this analysis to specific examples, obtaining new existence\\nand multiplicity results for the considered periodic problems, going beyond the\\ninformation variational and fixed point methods like Poincar\\\\'e-Birkhoff\\ntheorem can provide.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CA\", \"categories\": \"math.CA,math.DS,math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:19:42Z\"}"}
