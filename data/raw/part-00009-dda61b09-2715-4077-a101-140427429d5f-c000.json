In studying these\\n\\\"cardinal characteristics of the continuum\\\", it was discovered that many of the\\nassociated inequalities can be interpreted as morphisms within the\\n\\\"Galois-Tukey\\\" category. This thesis aims to reformulate traditional direct\\nproofs of cardinal characteristic inequalities by making the underlying\\nmorphisms explicit. New, purely categorical results are also discussed.\", \"main_category\": \"math.LO\", \"categories\": \"math.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T05:00:16Z\"}"}
