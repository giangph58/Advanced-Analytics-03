{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02241v1\", \"title\": \"Quantum Deep Sets and Sequences\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces the quantum deep sets model, expanding the quantum\\nmachine learning tool-box by enabling the possibility of learning variadic\\nfunctions using quantum systems. A couple of variants are presented for this\\nmodel. The first one focuses on mapping sets to quantum systems through state\\nvector averaging: each element of the set is mapped to a quantum state, and the\\nquantum state of the set is the average of the corresponding quantum states of\\nits elements. This approach allows the definition of a permutation-invariant\\nvariadic model. The second variant is useful for ordered sets, i.e., sequences,\\nand relies on optimal coherification of tristochastic tensors that implement\\nproducts of mixed states: each element of the set is mapped to a density\\nmatrix, and the quantum state of the set is the product of the corresponding\\ndensity matrices of its elements. Such variant can be relevant in tasks such as\\nnatural language processing. The resulting quantum state in any of the variants\\nis then processed to realise a function that solves a machine learning task\\nsuch as classification, regression or density estimation. Through synthetic\\nproblem examples, the efficacy and versatility of quantum deep sets and\\nsequences (QDSs) is demonstrated.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T03:14:17Z\"}"}
