Thanks to optimized data selection, we achieve a factor of two\\nimprovement in precision, obtaining T1/2 = (9.32 +0.05 -0.04 (stat.) +0.07\\n-0.07 (syst.)) x10^20 yr. The signal-to-background ratio is increased by 70%\\ncompared to our previous results, enabling the first application of the\\nimproved 2nbb formalism to 130Te. Within this framework, we determine a\\ncredibility interval for the effective axial coupling in the nuclear medium as\\na function of nuclear matrix elements. We also extract values for the\\nhigher-order nuclear matrix element ratios: second-to-first and third-to-first.\\nThe second-to-first ratio agrees with nuclear model predictions, while the\\nthird-to-first ratio deviates from theoretical expectations. These findings\\nprovide essential tests of nuclear models and key inputs for future 0nbb\\nsearches.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-ex\", \"categories\": \"nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:19:33Z\"}"}
