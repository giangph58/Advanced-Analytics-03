The external input is\\nassumed to follow an uncertain distribution within a Wasserstein ambiguity set.\\nWe begin by considering the case where the distribution is certain and\\nformulate an optimization problem to obtain the reduced model. When the\\ndistribution is uncertain, the interaction between the reduced-order model and\\nthe distribution is modeled by a Stackelberg game. To ensure solvability, we\\nfirst introduce the Gelbrich distance and demonstrate that the Stackelberg game\\nwithin a Wasserstein ambiguity set is equivalent to that within a Gelbrich\\nambiguity set. Then, we propose a nested optimization problem to solve the\\nStackelberg game. Furthermore, the nested optimization problem is relaxed into\\na nested convex optimization problem, ensuring computational feasibility.\\nFinally, a simulation is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the\\nproposed method.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T10:13:12Z\"}"}
