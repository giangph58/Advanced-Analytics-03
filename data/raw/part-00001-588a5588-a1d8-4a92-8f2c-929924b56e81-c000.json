The primary goal of this paper is to demonstrate the optimal\\nconvergence of the truncated EM method without infinitesimal factors. Besides,\\nthe logarithmic truncated EM method has not been studied in multi-dimensional\\ncases, which is the other goal of this paper. We will show the optimal strong\\nconvergence order of the positivity-preserving logarithmic truncated EM method\\nfor solving multi-dimensional SDEs with positive solutions. Numerical examples\\nare given to support our theoretical conclusions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T03:15:16Z\"}"}
