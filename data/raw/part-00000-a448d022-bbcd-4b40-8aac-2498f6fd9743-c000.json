The binding energy and radii are compared with\\nthe results obtained from relativistic Hartree calculations along with the\\nexperimental data, wherever available, to check the reliability of the methods.\\nThe calculations are extended to estimate the giant monopole resonances to\\nunderstand the collective vibration of the nucleons for such superheavy nuclei.\\nThe giant monopole resonances obtained from scaling calculations are compared\\nwith the constraint computations. Furthermore, the results are compared with\\nother known methods, such as the relativistic Random Phase Approximation (RPA)\\nand time-dependent mean field calculations, along with some known lighter\\nnuclei, specifically Zr isotopes (N = 42-86) and O isotopes (N = 10-36).\\nFinally, the nuclear compressibility of the superheavy nuclei is predicted from\\nthe energy obtained in the breathing mode.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T07:46:47Z\"}"}
