{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17323v1\", \"title\": \"CKMDiff: A Generative Diffusion Model for CKM Construction via Inverse\\n  Problems with Learned Priors\", \"summary\": \"Channel knowledge map (CKM) is a promising technology to enable\\nenvironment-aware wireless communications and sensing with greatly enhanced\\nperformance, by offering location-specific channel prior information for future\\nwireless networks. One fundamental problem for CKM-enabled wireless systems\\nlies in how to construct high-quality and complete CKM for all locations of\\ninterest, based on only limited and noisy on-site channel knowledge data. This\\nproblem resembles the long-standing ill-posed inverse problem, which tries to\\ninfer from a set of limited and noisy observations the cause factors that\\nproduced them. By utilizing the recent advances of solving inverse problems\\nwith learned priors using generative artificial intelligence (AI), we propose\\nCKMDiff, a conditional diffusion model that can be applied to perform various\\ntasks for CKM constructions such as denoising, inpainting, and\\nsuper-resolution, without having to know the physical environment maps or\\ntransceiver locations. Furthermore, we propose an environment-aware data\\naugmentation mechanism to enhance the model's ability to learn implicit\\nrelations between electromagnetic propagation patterns and spatial-geometric\\nfeatures. Extensive numerical results are provided based on the CKMImageNet and\\nRadioMapSeer datasets, which demonstrate that the proposed CKMDiff achieves\\nstate-of-the-art performance, outperforming various benchmark methods.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T07:26:18Z\"}"}
