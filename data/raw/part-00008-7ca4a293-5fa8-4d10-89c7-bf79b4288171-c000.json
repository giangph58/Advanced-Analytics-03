{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12206v1\", \"title\": \"Finite GK-dimensional pre-Nichols algebras and quasi-quantum groups\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we study the classification of finite GK-dimensional\\npre-Nichols algebras in the twisted Yetter-Drinfeld module category $_{\\\\k\\nG}^{\\\\k G} \\\\mathcal{YD}^\\\\Phi$, where $G$ is a finite abelian group and $\\\\Phi$ is\\na $3$-cocycle on $G$. These algebras naturally arise from quasi-quantum groups\\nover finite abelian groups. We prove that all pre-Nichols algebras of\\nnondiagonal type in $_{\\\\k G}^{\\\\k G} \\\\mathcal{YD}^\\\\Phi$ are infinite\\nGK-dimensional, and every graded pre-Nichols algebra in $_{\\\\k G}^{\\\\k G}\\n\\\\mathcal{YD}^\\\\Phi$ with finite GK-dimension is twist equivalent to a graded\\npre-Nichols algebra in an ordinary Yetter-Drinfeld module category $_{\\\\k G}^{\\\\k\\nG} \\\\mathcal{YD}^\\\\Phi$, where $\\\\mathbb{G}$ is a finite abelian group determined\\nby $G$. In particular, we obtain a complete classification of finitely\\ngenerated Nichols algebras with finite GK-dimension in $_{\\\\k G}^{\\\\k G}\\n\\\\mathcal{YD}^\\\\Phi$. We prove that a finitely generated Nichols algebra in $_{\\\\k\\nG}^{\\\\k G} \\\\mathcal{YD}^\\\\Phi$ is finite GK-dimensional if and only if it is of\\ndiagonal type and the corresponding root system is finite, i.e., an arithmetic\\nroot system. Via bosonization, this yields a large class of infinite\\nquasi-quantum groups over finite abelian groups.\", \"main_category\": \"math.QA\", \"categories\": \"math.QA,math.RA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T15:54:42Z\"}"}
