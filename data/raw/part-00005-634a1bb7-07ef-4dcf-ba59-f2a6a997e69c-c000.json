Previous methods like COLMAP and GLOMAP are able to\\nestimate high-precision camera poses, but suffer from poor scalability when the\\nnumber of matched keypoint pairs becomes large. We identify two key factors\\nleading to this problem: poor parallelization and computationally expensive\\noptimization steps. To overcome these issues, we design an SfM framework that\\nrelies entirely on GPU-friendly operations, making it easily parallelizable.\\nMoreover, each optimization step runs in time linear to the number of image\\npairs, independent of keypoint pairs or 3D points. Through extensive\\nexperiments, we show that FastMap is one to two orders of magnitude faster than\\nCOLMAP and GLOMAP on large-scale scenes with comparable pose accuracy.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T17:56:15Z\"}"}
