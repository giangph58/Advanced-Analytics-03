It\\nincludes binary rank and select support structures that provide at least 10\\ntimes higher throughput of binary rank and select queries than the best\\npublicly available CPU implementations at comparable storage overhead. My work\\nalso presents a new parallel tree construction algorithm that, when excluding\\nthe time to copy the data from the CPU to the GPU, outperforms the current\\nstate of the art. The GPU implementation, given enough parallelism, processes\\naccess, rank, and select queries at least 2x faster than the wavelet tree\\nimplementation contained in the widely used Succinct Data Structure Library\\n(SDSL), including the time necessary to copy the queries from the CPU to the\\nGPU and the results back to the CPU from the GPU.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T09:43:06Z\"}"}
