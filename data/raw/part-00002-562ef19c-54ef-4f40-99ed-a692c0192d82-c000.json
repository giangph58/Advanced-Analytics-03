In\\nthis paper, we present GreenMind-Medium-14B-R1, the Vietnamese reasoning model\\ninspired by the finetuning strategy based on Group Relative Policy\\nOptimization. We also leverage a high-quality Vietnamese synthesized reasoning\\ndataset and design two reward functions to tackle the main limitations of this\\ntechnique: (i) language mixing, where we explicitly detect the presence of\\nbiased language characters during the process of sampling tokens, and (ii) we\\nleverage Sentence Transformer-based models to ensure that the generated\\nreasoning content maintains factual correctness and does not distort the final\\noutput. Experimental results on the Vietnamese dataset from the VLSP 2023\\nChallenge demonstrate that our model outperforms prior works and enhances\\nlinguistic consistency in its responses. Furthermore, we extend our evaluation\\nto SeaExam-a multilingual multiple-choice dataset, showing the effectiveness of\\nour reasoning method compared to few-shot prompting techniques.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:48:55Z\"}"}
