M-dwarf\\nflares sometimes show prominence eruption signatures, observed as blue/red\\nasymmetries in the H$\\\\alpha$ line. In Paper I, we reported four candidates of\\nprominence eruptions, which shows large diversity in their durations and\\nvelocities. In this study, we statistically investigate how blue/red\\nasymmetries are related with their flare and starspot properties, using the\\ndataset from 27 H$\\\\alpha$ flares in Paper I and previously reported 8 H$\\\\alpha$\\nflares on an M-dwarf YZ Canis Minoris. We found that these asymmetry events\\ntend to show larger H$\\\\alpha$ flare energies compared to non-asymmetry events.\\nIn particular, 5 out of 6 blue asymmetry events are not associated with\\nwhite-light flares, whereas all 7 red asymmetry events are associated with\\nwhite-light flares. Furthermore, their starspot distributions estimated from\\nthe TESS light curve show that all prominence eruption candidates occurred when\\nstarspots were located on the stellar disk center as well as on the stellar\\nlimb. These results suggest that flares with lower heating rates may have a\\nhigher association rate with prominence eruptions and/or the possibility that\\nprominence eruptions are more detectable on the limb than on the disk center on\\nM-dwarfs. These results provide significant insights into CMEs that can affect\\nthe habitable world around M-dwarfs.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T05:10:20Z\"}"}
