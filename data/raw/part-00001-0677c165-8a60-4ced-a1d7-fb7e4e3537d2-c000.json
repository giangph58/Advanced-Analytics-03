When axions with masses between\\n$1\\\\times10^{-15}\\\\,{\\\\rm eV}$ and $1\\\\times10^{-13}\\\\,{\\\\rm eV}$ pass through the\\nEarth, they interact with the global geomagnetic field, generating\\nelectromagnetic (EM) waves in the extremely low-frequency range\\n($0.3$--$30\\\\,{\\\\rm Hz}$) through axion-photon coupling. This paper is one of a\\nseries of companion papers for~\\\\cite{Taruya:2025zql}, focusing on the data\\nanalysis method and search results for an axion signal. Utilizing the\\ntheoretical predictions of axion-induced EM spectra from a companion study, we\\nanalyzed long-term observational data of terrestrial magnetic fields in this\\nfrequency band to search for axion-induced signals. Our analysis identified 65\\npersistent signal candidates with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than 3.\\nAside from these candidates, we placed a new upper bound on the axion-photon\\ncoupling parameter, significantly refining the previous constraint from CAST by\\nat most two orders of magnitude down to $g_{a\\\\gamma} \\\\lesssim 4\\\\times10^{-13}\\n\\\\,{\\\\rm GeV}^{-1}$ for the axion mass around $3 \\\\times 10^{-14}\\\\,{\\\\rm eV}$.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T08:40:39Z\"}"}
