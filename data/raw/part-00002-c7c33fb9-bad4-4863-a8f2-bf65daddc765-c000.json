{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12955v1\", \"title\": \"Systemic risk mitigation in supply chains through network rewiring\", \"summary\": \"The networked nature of supply chains makes them susceptible to systemic\\nrisk, where local firm failures can propagate through firm interdependencies\\nthat can lead to cascading supply chain disruptions. The systemic risk of\\nsupply chains can be quantified and is closely related to the topology and\\ndynamics of supply chain networks (SCN). How different network properties\\ncontribute to this risk remains unclear. Here, we ask whether systemic risk can\\nbe significantly reduced by strategically rewiring supplier-customer links. In\\ndoing so, we understand the role of specific endogenously emerged network\\nstructures and to what extent the observed systemic risk is a result of\\nfundamental properties of the dynamical system. We minimize systemic risk\\nthrough rewiring by employing a method from statistical physics that respects\\nfirm-level constraints to production. Analyzing six specific subnetworks of the\\nnational SCNs of Ecuador and Hungary, we demonstrate that systemic risk can be\\nconsiderably mitigated by 16-50% without reducing the production output of\\nfirms. A comparison of network properties before and after rewiring reveals\\nthat this risk reduction is achieved by changing the connectivity in\\nnon-trivial ways. These results suggest that actual SCN topologies carry\\nunnecessarily high levels of systemic risk. We discuss the possibility of\\ndevising policies to reduce systemic risk through minimal, targeted\\ninterventions in supply chain networks through market-based incentives.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,physics.soc-ph,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T13:59:01Z\"}"}
