{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21606v1\", \"title\": \"Measurement-Based Line-Impedance Estimation in the Absence of Phasor\\n  Measurement Units\", \"summary\": \"This paper proposes and compares experimentally several methods to estimate\\nthe series resistance and reactance (i.e., the transversal components of the\\n$\\\\pi$-model of a line) of low-voltage lines in distribution grids. It first\\nshows that if phasor measurements are available and the grid nodal voltages and\\npower injections are known, the problem can be formulated and solved as a\\nconventional load flow with properly adjusted unknowns. To solve this problem,\\nwe propose an analytical derivation of the Jacobian matrix. If only RMS values\\nare available, such as from smart meters, integrating information from multiple\\nintervals becomes necessary, ultimately opening to least-squares estimations,\\nwidely adopted in the literature. In this context, applying the proposed\\nJacobian contributes to accelerating the problem resolution of existing\\nalgorithms. The methods are compared in terms of estimation performance and\\nconvergence by using measurements from an experimental distribution grid\\ninterfacing real-world components and with realistic size implemented at the\\nGridlab at HES-SO Valais.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T13:06:50Z\"}"}
