We propose\\na reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS)-assisted beamfocusing mechanism,\\nwhere the design of the two-dimensional beam codebook that contains both the\\nangular and distance domains is challenging. To address this issue, we\\nintroduce a novel Transformer-based two-stage beam training algorithm, which\\nincludes the coarse and fine search phases. The proposed mechanism provides a\\nfine-grained codebook with enhanced spatial resolution, enabling precise\\nbeamfocusing. Specifically, in the first stage, the beam training is performed\\nto estimate the approximate location of the device by using a simple codebook,\\ndetermining whether it is within the beamfocusing range (BFR) or the\\nnone-beamfocusing range (NBFR). In the second stage, by using a more precise\\ncodebook, a fine-grained beam search strategy is conducted. Experimental\\nresults unveil that the precision of the RIS-assisted beamfocusing is greatly\\nimproved. The proposed method achieves beam selection accuracy up to 97% at\\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 20 dB, and improves 10% to 50% over the baseline\\nmethod at different SNRs.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T12:29:10Z\"}"}
