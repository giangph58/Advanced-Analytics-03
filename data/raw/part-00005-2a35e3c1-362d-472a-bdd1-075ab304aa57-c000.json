Simulations are conducted for each fuel in a\\ndense spray region, where the liquid volume fraction exceeds\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$. The focus is on investigating the complex interactions\\nbetween droplets, turbulence, and phase change, with emphasis on\\ndroplet-droplet interactions and their influence on the evaporation process. We\\nprovide state-of-the-art insights into the evaporation characteristics of two\\ndifferent fuels under turbulent conditions, aiming to provide a deeper\\nunderstanding of their different evaporation rates in spray-combustion\\napplications. To this end, the present study also explores how varying\\nturbulence intensities affect the evaporation rates of each fuel, revealing\\ndifferences in coalescence behavior and energy transfer from the liquid to the\\ngaseous phase. These findings are crucial to the improvement of predictive CFD\\nmodels and to the optimization of fuel injection in spray-combustion\\napplications, especially under high-pressure conditions.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T16:11:29Z\"}"}
