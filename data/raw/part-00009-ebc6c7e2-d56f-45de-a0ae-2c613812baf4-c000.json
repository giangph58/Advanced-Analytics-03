In particular, we propose a modified version of the\\nAccelerated Distributed Directed OPTimization (ADD-OPT) algorithm, herein\\ncalled Robustified ADD-OPT (R-ADD-OPT), which is able to solve the distributed\\noptimization problem, even when the communication links suffer from\\nheterogeneous but bounded transmission delays. We show that if the gradient\\nstep-size of the R-ADD-OPT algorithm is within a certain range, which also\\ndepends on the maximum time delay in the network, then the nodes are guaranteed\\nto converge to the optimal solution of the distributed optimization problem.\\nThe range of the gradient step-size that guarantees convergence can be computed\\na priori based on the maximum time delay in the network.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T08:14:30Z\"}"}
