{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01769v1\", \"title\": \"Operator aspects of wave propagation through periodic media\", \"summary\": \"Recent results in quantitative homogenisation of the wave equation with\\nrapidly oscillating coefficients are discussed from the operator-theoretic\\nperspective, which views the solution as the result of applying the operator of\\nhyperbolic dynamics, i.e. the unitary group of a self-adjoint operator on a\\nsuitable Hilbert space. A prototype one-dimensional example of utilising the\\nframework of Ryzhov boundary triples is analysed, where operator-norm resolvent\\nestimates for the problem of classical moderate-contrast homogenisation are\\nobtained. By an appropriate \\\"dilation\\\" procedure, these are shown to upgrade to\\nsecond-order (and more generally, higher-order) estimates for the resolvent and\\nthe unitary group describing the evolution for the related wave equation.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T14:26:48Z\"}"}
