We study the expressiveness of\\nsuch stochastically-resolvable automata as well as consider the decision\\nquestions of whether a given automaton has this property. In particular, we\\nshow that it is undecidable to check if a given NFA is $\\\\lambda$-stochastically\\nresolvable. This problem is decidable for finitely-ambiguous automata. We also\\npresent complexity upper and lower bounds for several well-studied classes of\\nautomata for which this problem remains decidable.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.FL\", \"categories\": \"cs.FL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T13:54:02Z\"}"}
