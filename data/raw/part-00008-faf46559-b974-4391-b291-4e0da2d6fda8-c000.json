We propose a novel classification method, termed\\nSSQDA, which is constructed via constrained convex optimization based on the\\nsample spatial median and spatial sign covariance matrix under the assumption\\nof an elliptically symmetric distribution. The proposed classifier is shown to\\nachieve the optimal convergence rate over a broad class of parameter spaces, up\\nto a logarithmic factor. Extensive simulation studies and real data\\napplications demonstrate that SSQDA is both robust and efficient, particularly\\nin the presence of heavy-tailed distributions, highlighting its practical\\nadvantages in high-dimensional classification tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T13:42:41Z\"}"}
