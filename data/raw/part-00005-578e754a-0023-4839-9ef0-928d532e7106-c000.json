{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15972v1\", \"title\": \"Bug Destiny Prediction in Large Open-Source Software Repositories\\n  through Sentiment Analysis and BERT Topic Modeling\", \"summary\": \"This study explores a novel approach to predicting key bug-related outcomes,\\nincluding the time to resolution, time to fix, and ultimate status of a bug,\\nusing data from the Bugzilla Eclipse Project. Specifically, we leverage\\nfeatures available before a bug is resolved to enhance predictive accuracy. Our\\nmethodology incorporates sentiment analysis to derive both an emotionality\\nscore and a sentiment classification (positive or negative). Additionally, we\\nintegrate the bug's priority level and its topic, extracted using a BERTopic\\nmodel, as features for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Multilayer\\nPerceptron (MLP). Our findings indicate that the combination of BERTopic and\\nsentiment analysis can improve certain model performance metrics. Furthermore,\\nwe observe that balancing model inputs enhances practical applicability, albeit\\nat the cost of a significant reduction in accuracy in most cases. To address\\nour primary objectives, predicting time-to-resolution, time-to-fix, and bug\\ndestiny, we employ both binary classification and exact time value predictions,\\nallowing for a comparative evaluation of their predictive effectiveness.\\nResults demonstrate that sentiment analysis serves as a valuable predictor of a\\nbug's eventual outcome, particularly in determining whether it will be fixed.\\nHowever, its utility is less pronounced when classifying bugs into more complex\\nor unconventional outcome categories.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T15:18:14Z\"}"}
