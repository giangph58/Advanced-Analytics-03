The relevance\\nof advertiser keyphrases plays an important role in preventing the inundation\\nof search systems with numerous irrelevant items that compete for attention in\\nauctions, in addition to maintaining a healthy seller perception. In this work,\\nwe describe the shortcomings of training Advertiser keyphrase relevance filter\\nmodels on click/sales/search relevance signals and the importance of aligning\\nwith human judgment, as sellers have the power to adopt or reject said\\nkeyphrase recommendations. In this study, we frame Advertiser keyphrase\\nrelevance as a complex interaction between 3 dynamical systems -- seller\\njudgment, which influences seller adoption of our product, Advertising, which\\nprovides the keyphrases to bid on, and Search, who holds the auctions for the\\nsame keyphrases. This study discusses the practicalities of using human\\njudgment via a case study at eBay Advertising and demonstrate that using\\nLLM-as-a-judge en-masse as a scalable proxy for seller judgment to train our\\nrelevance models achieves a better harmony across the three systems -- provided\\nthat they are bound by a meticulous evaluation framework grounded in business\\nmetrics.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:03:25Z\"}"}
