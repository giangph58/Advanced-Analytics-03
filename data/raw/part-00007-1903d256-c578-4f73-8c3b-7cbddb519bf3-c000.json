{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03651v1\", \"title\": \"Optimal Droop Control Strategy for Coordinated Voltage Regulation and\\n  Power Sharing in Hybrid AC-MTDC Systems\", \"summary\": \"With the growing integration of modular multilevel converters (MMCs) in\\nMulti-Terminal Direct Current (MTDC) transmission systems, there is an\\nincreasing need for control strategies that ensure both economic efficiency and\\nrobust dynamic performance. This paper presents an enhanced Optimal Power Flow\\n(OPF) framework for hybrid AC-MTDC systems, integrating a novel droop control\\nstrategy that coordinates DC voltage and AC frequency regulation. By embedding\\nfrequency control loops into the MMCs, the method enables system-wide\\ncoordination, enhancing power sharing and improving system resilience under\\ndisturbances. The proposed strategy dynamically adjusts converter operating\\npoints to minimize generation costs and DC voltage deviations, thus balancing\\neconomic objectives with system stability. A modified Nordic test system\\nintegrated with a four-terminal MTDC grid is used to validate the approach.\\nOptimization is performed using Julia, while the system's dynamic performance\\nis evaluated through electromagnetic transient simulations with the EMTP\\nsoftware. Case studies across multiple scenarios demonstrate that the proposed\\nmethod consistently achieves lower generation costs than active power control\\nand adaptive droop control strategy while maintaining stable control\\ncharacteristics. The results highlight the method's capability to deliver\\ncost-effective operation without compromising performance, offering a promising\\nsolution for the coordinated control of future hybrid AC-DC transmission\\nnetworks.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:57:51Z\"}"}
