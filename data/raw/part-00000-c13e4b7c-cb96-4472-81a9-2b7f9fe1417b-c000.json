{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07870v1\", \"title\": \"Open Datasets for Grid Modeling and Visualization: An Alberta Power\\n  Network Case\", \"summary\": \"In the power and energy industry, multiple entities in grid operational logs\\nare frequently recorded and updated. Thanks to recent advances in IT facilities\\nand smart metering services, a variety of datasets such as system load,\\ngeneration mix, and grid connection are often publicly available. While these\\nresources are valuable in evaluating power grid's operational conditions and\\nsystem resilience, the lack of fine-grained, accurate locational information\\nconstrain the usage of current data, which further hinders the development of\\nsmart grid and renewables integration. For instance, electricity end users are\\nnot aware of nodal generation mix or carbon emissions, while the general public\\nhave limited understanding about the effect of demand response or renewables\\nintegration if only the whole system's demands and generations are available.\\nIn this work, we focus on recovering power grid topology and line flow\\ndirections from open public dataset. Taking the Alberta grid as a working\\nexample, we start from mapping multi-modal power system datasets to the grid\\ntopology integrated with geographical information. By designing a novel\\noptimization-based scheme to recover line flow directions, we are able to\\nanalyze and visualize the interactions between generations and demand vectors\\nin an efficient manner. Proposed research is fully open-sourced and highly\\ngeneralizable, which can help model and visualize grid information, create\\nsynthetic dataset, and facilitate analytics and decision-making framework for\\nclean energy transition.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.SY,eess.SP,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:45:07Z\"}"}
