{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05259v1\", \"title\": \"Decoding the molecular torus of NGC 1068: Insights into its structure\\n  and kinematics from high-resolution ALMA observations\", \"summary\": \"We dissect the kinematics and morphology of the molecular gas within the\\nnear-nuclear region of NGC 1068 to understand the mechanisms in the central AGN\\nthat might be fueling it, and the impact of its energy output on the\\nsurrounding molecular gas. We present high angular and spectral resolution ALMA\\nobservations of the HCO$^+$4->3 and CO 3->2 molecular lines in the near-nuclear\\nregion of the prototype Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068. The spatial resolution\\n(1.1~pc) is almost two times better than that of previous works studying the\\nsame molecular lines at the same transitions and is the highest resolution\\nachievable with ALMA at these frequencies. Our analysis focuses on moment maps,\\nposition-velocity (PV) diagrams, and spectra obtained at the position of the\\nnuclear continuum source, along with a simple kinematic model developed using\\nthe 3DBarolo software. Our observations reveal significant asymmetry between\\nthe eastern and western sides of the nuclear disc in terms of morphology,\\nvelocity, and line intensity. The broad lines seen in the inner 2 pc could be\\naccounted for by either beam smearing or highly turbulent gas in this region.\\nOutside this radius the mean velocities drop to $\\\\pm$30 km/s, which cannot be\\nexplained by asymmetric drift. We find low velocity connections extending to 13\\npc suggesting interactions with larger scale structures. The CO/HCO$^+$ line\\nratio at the nucleus reported here are extremely low compared to values in the\\nliterature of the same galaxy at lower spatial resolutions.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:05:06Z\"}"}
