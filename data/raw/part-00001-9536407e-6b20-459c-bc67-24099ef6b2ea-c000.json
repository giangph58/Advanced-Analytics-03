We propose a function approximation method\\nthat leverages and unifies two prior techniques: (i) approximating a pullback\\nto the tangent space, and (ii) the Riemannian moving least squares method. The\\ncore idea of the new scheme is to combine pullbacks to multiple tangent spaces\\nwith a weighted Fr\\\\'echet mean. The effectiveness of this approach is\\nillustrated with numerical experiments on model problems from parametric model\\norder reduction.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T12:33:30Z\"}"}
