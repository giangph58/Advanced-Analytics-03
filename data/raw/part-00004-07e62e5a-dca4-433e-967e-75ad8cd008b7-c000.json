{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07732v1\", \"title\": \"Efficient Formal Verification of Quantum Error Correcting Programs\", \"summary\": \"Quantum error correction (QEC) is fundamental for suppressing noise in\\nquantum hardware and enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation. In this\\npaper, we propose an efficient verification framework for QEC programs. We\\ndefine an assertion logic and a program logic specifically crafted for QEC\\nprograms and establish a sound proof system. We then develop an efficient\\nmethod for handling verification conditions (VCs) of QEC programs: for Pauli\\nerrors, the VCs are reduced to classical assertions that can be solved by SMT\\nsolvers, and for non-Pauli errors, we provide a heuristic algorithm. We\\nformalize the proposed program logic in Coq proof assistant, making it a\\nverified QEC verifier. Additionally, we implement an automated QEC verifier,\\nVeri-QEC, for verifying various fault-tolerant scenarios. We demonstrate the\\nefficiency and broad functionality of the framework by performing different\\nverification tasks across various scenarios. Finally, we present a benchmark of\\n14 verified stabilizer codes.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.PL\", \"categories\": \"cs.PL,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T13:28:49Z\"}"}
