Then, using the National Institute of Standards and Technology\\n(NIST) AI 100-4 report as a reflection of current synthetic content governance\\nmethods, we show how the current landscape of practices fails to effectively\\nregulate the MTE for adult AIG-NCII, as well as flawed assumptions explaining\\nthese gaps.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.AI,cs.CY,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:31:46Z\"}"}
