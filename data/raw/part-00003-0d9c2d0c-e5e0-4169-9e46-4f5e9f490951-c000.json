We investigate and present a few classes of graphs for which the\\nsemidefinite relaxation of the maximum cut problem is exact. For each of these\\nclasses, we determine the optimal objective value by explicitly constructing a\\nmaximum cut. Furthermore, we prove the uniqueness of the exact solution for two\\nof these graph classes.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T12:56:40Z\"}"}
