This gives an unconditional proof for the range previously\\nknown under the Selberg eigenvalue conjecture. Furthermore, we get uniformity\\nin $h \\\\leq n^{1+o(1)}$ under a natural hypothesis on real characters. The same\\nuniformity is obtained for the equidistribution of the roots of quadratic\\ncongruences modulo primes. We also prove a variant of the divisor problem for\\n$ax^2+by^3$, which was used by the second author to give a conditional result\\nabout primes of that shape.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T12:47:12Z\"}"}
