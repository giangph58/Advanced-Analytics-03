{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21298v1\", \"title\": \"Preparation Circuits for Matrix Product States by Classical Variational\\n  Disentanglement\", \"summary\": \"We study the classical compilation of quantum circuits for the preparation of\\nmatrix product states (MPS), which are quantum states of low entanglement with\\nan efficient classical description. Our algorithm represents a near-term\\nalternative to previous sequential approaches by reverse application of a\\ndisentangler, which can be found by minimizing bipartite entanglement measures\\nafter the application of a layer of parameterized disentangling gates. Since a\\nsuccessful disentangler is expected to decrease the bond dimension on average,\\nsuch a layer-by-layer optimization remains classically efficient even for deep\\ncircuits. Additionally, as the Schmidt coefficients of all bonds are locally\\naccessible through the canonical $\\\\Gamma$-$\\\\Lambda$ form of an MPS, the\\noptimization algorithm can be heavily parallelized. We discuss guarantees and\\nlimitations to trainability and show numerical results for ground states of\\none-dimensional, local Hamiltonians as well as artificially spread out\\nentanglement among multiple qubits using error correcting codes.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T04:13:01Z\"}"}
