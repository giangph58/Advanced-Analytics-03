The metric resembles the Schwarzschild solution in the\\nclassical limit. The departure from Schwarzschild at small scales is controlled\\nby a single free parameter related to the ultraviolet (UV) cutoff of the\\ntheory. We investigated null and time-like geodesics around the AS metric,\\nincluding circular orbits, photon rings and lensing effects. In particular we\\nfocused on the optical properties of thin accretion disks in the equatorial\\nplane of the object and compared them with those of accretion disks in the\\nSchwarzschild metric. We found that the radiation flux, luminosity, and\\nefficiency of the accretion disk increase with the value of the free parameter.\\nUsing a spacetime generic open-source relativistic ray-tracing code, we\\nsimulate the K$\\\\alpha$ iron line profiles emitted by the disk and analyze their\\ndeviation from that of the Schwarzschild geometry.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T13:28:51Z\"}"}
