Microfabricated chip-based 3D\\nion traps are scalable to store many ions for the realization of a large number\\nof qubits, provide deep trapping potentials compared to surface traps, and very\\ngood shielding from external electric fields. In this work, we give an overview\\nof our recent developments on chip-based 3D ion traps. Different types of chip\\nmaterials, the integration of electronic filter components on-chip and compact\\nelectrical connections in vacuum are discussed. Further, based on finite\\nelement method (FEM) simulations, we discuss how integrating micro-optics in 3D\\nion traps is possible without disturbing the trapped ions.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:33:37Z\"}"}
