{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04136v1\", \"title\": \"Delegation and Participation in Decentralized Governance: An Epistemic\\n  View\", \"summary\": \"We develop and apply epistemic tests to various decentralized governance\\nmethods as well as to study the impact of participation. These tests probe the\\nability to reach a correct outcome when there is one. We find that partial\\nabstention is a strong governance method from an epistemic standpoint compared\\nto alternatives such as various forms of ``transfer delegation\\\" in which voters\\nexplicitly transfer some or all of their voting rights to others. We make a\\nstronger case for multi-step transfer delegation than is present in previous\\nwork but also demonstrate that transfer delegation has inherent epistemic\\nweaknesses. We show that enhanced direct participation, voters exercising their\\nown voting rights, can have a variety of epistemic impacts, some very negative.\\nWe identify governance conditions under which additional direct participation\\nis guaranteed to do no epistemic harm and is likely to increase the probability\\nof making correct decisions. In light of the epistemic challenges of\\nvoting-based decentralized governance, we consider the possible supplementary\\nuse of prediction markets, auctions, and AI agents to improve outcomes. All\\nthese results are significant because epistemic performance matters if entities\\nsuch as DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) wish to compete with\\norganizations that are more centralized.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SI\", \"categories\": \"cs.SI,cs.GT,econ.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T05:20:30Z\"}"}
