It leverages the advanced natural\\nlanguage understanding of state-of-the-art transformer models to analyze\\ntextual artifacts, such as developer discussions in issue reports, where subtle\\nindicators of debt often lie hidden.\\n  TD-Suite provides a seamless end-to-end pipeline, managing everything from\\ninitial data ingestion and rigorous preprocessing to model training, thorough\\nevaluation, and final inference. This allows it to support both straightforward\\nbinary classification (debt or no debt) and more valuable, identifying specific\\ncategories like code, design, or documentation debt, thus enabling more\\ntargeted management strategies.\\n  To ensure the generated models are robust and perform reliably on real-world,\\noften imbalanced, datasets, TD-Suite incorporates critical training\\nmethodologies: k-fold cross-validation assesses generalization capability,\\nearly stopping mechanisms prevent overfitting to the training data, and class\\nweighting strategies effectively address skewed data distributions. Beyond core\\nfunctionality, and acknowledging the growing importance of sustainability, the\\nframework integrates tracking and reporting of carbon emissions associated with\\nthe computationally intensive model training process.\\n  It also features a user-friendly Gradio web interface in a Docker container\\nsetup, simplifying model interaction, evaluation, and inference.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T11:31:17Z\"}"}
