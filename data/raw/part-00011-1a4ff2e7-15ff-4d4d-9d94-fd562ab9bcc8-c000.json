The method rests on a theorem involving the single electron\\nself-energy $\\\\Sigma_\\\\sigma(k, i \\\\omega_n)$ in the imaginary time Matsubara\\nformulation. The theorem maps the Yang-Lee zeros to a set of wavevector and\\nspin labeled virtual energies $\\\\xi_{k \\\\sigma}$. These, thermodynamically\\nderived virtual energies, are solutions of equations involving the self-energy\\nat corresponding $k\\\\sigma$'s. Examples of the method in simplified situations\\nare provided.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T16:39:15Z\"}"}
