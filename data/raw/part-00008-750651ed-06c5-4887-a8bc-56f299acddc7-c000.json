{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13047v1\", \"title\": \"Observation of quantum entanglement between free electrons and photons\", \"summary\": \"Quantum entanglement is central to both the foundations of quantum mechanics\\nand the development of new technologies in information processing,\\ncommunication, and sensing. Entanglement has been realised in a variety of\\nphysical systems, spanning atoms, ions, photons, collective excitations, and\\nhybrid combinations of particles. Remarkably, however, photons and free\\nelectrons -- the quanta of light and their most elementary sources -- have\\nnever been observed in an entangled state. Here, we demonstrate quantum\\nentanglement between free electrons and photons. We show that entanglement is\\nproduced when an electron, prepared in a superposition of two beams, passes a\\nnanostructure and generates transition radiation in a polarisation state tied\\nto the electron path. By implementing quantum state tomography, we reconstruct\\nthe full density matrix of the electron-photon pair, and show that the\\nPeres-Horodecki separability criterion is violated by more than 7 standard\\ndeviations. Based on this foundational element of emerging free-electron\\nquantum optics, we anticipate manifold developments in enhanced electron\\nimaging and spectroscopy beyond the standard quantum limit. More broadly, the\\nability to generate and measure entanglement opens electron microscopy to\\npreviously inaccessible quantum observables and correlations in solids and\\nnanostructures.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T16:03:05Z\"}"}
