{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11854v1\", \"title\": \"Less-excludable Mechanism for DAOs in Public Good Auctions\", \"summary\": \"With the rise of smart contracts, decentralized autonomous organizations\\n(DAOs) have emerged in public good auctions, allowing \\\"small\\\" bidders to gather\\ntogether and enlarge their influence in high-valued auctions. However, models\\nand mechanisms in the existing research literature do not guarantee\\nnon-excludability, which is a main property of public goods. As such, some\\nmembers of the winning DAO may be explicitly prevented from accessing the\\npublic good. This side effect leads to regrouping of small bidders within the\\nDAO to have a larger say in the final outcome. In particular, we provide a\\npolynomial-time algorithm to compute the best regrouping of bidders that\\nmaximizes the total bidding power of a DAO. We also prove that such a\\nregrouping is less-excludable, better aligning the needs of the entire DAO and\\nthe nature of public goods. Next, notice that members of a DAO in public good\\nauctions often have a positive externality among themselves. Thus we introduce\\na collective factor into the members' utility functions. We further extend the\\nmechanism's allocation for each member to allow for partial access to the\\npublic good. Under the new model, we propose a mechanism that is incentive\\ncompatible in generic games and achieves higher social welfare as well as\\nless-excludable allocations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GT\", \"categories\": \"cs.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T08:21:51Z\"}"}
