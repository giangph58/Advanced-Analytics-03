{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16692v1\", \"title\": \"Energy-Based Pseudo-Label Refining for Source-free Domain Adaptation\", \"summary\": \"Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA), which involves adapting models without\\naccess to source data, is both demanding and challenging. Existing SFDA\\ntechniques typically rely on pseudo-labels generated from confidence levels,\\nleading to negative transfer due to significant noise. To tackle this problem,\\nEnergy-Based Pseudo-Label Refining (EBPR) is proposed for SFDA. Pseudo-labels\\nare created for all sample clusters according to their energy scores. Global\\nand class energy thresholds are computed to selectively filter pseudo-labels.\\nFurthermore, a contrastive learning strategy is introduced to filter difficult\\nsamples, aligning them with their augmented versions to learn more\\ndiscriminative features. Our method is validated on the Office-31, Office-Home,\\nand VisDA-C datasets, consistently finding that our model outperformed\\nstate-of-the-art methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T13:26:58Z\"}"}
