However, these approaches have faced criticism for potentially\\nsuppressing certain emotional experiences. Through a scoping review of 53\\nempirical studies from ACM proceedings implementing Technology-Mediated Emotion\\nIntervention (TMEI), we critically examine current practices through lenses\\ndrawn from HCI critical theories. Our analysis reveals emotion intervention\\nmechanisms that extend beyond traditional emotion regulation paradigms,\\nidentifying care-centered goals that prioritize non-judgmental emotional\\nsupport and preserve users' identities. The findings demonstrate how\\nresearchers design technologies for generating artificial care, intervening in\\npower dynamics, and nudging behavioral changes. We contribute the concept of\\n\\\"emotion support\\\" as an alternative approach to \\\"emotion regulation,\\\"\\nemphasizing human-centered approaches to emotional well-being. This work\\nadvances the understanding of diverse human emotional needs beyond individual\\nand cognitive perspectives, offering design implications that critically\\nreimagine how technologies can honor emotional complexity, preserve human\\nagency, and transform power dynamics in care contexts.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T03:35:01Z\"}"}
