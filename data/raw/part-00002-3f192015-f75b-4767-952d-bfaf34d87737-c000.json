We rigorously prove the\\nunconditional stability and pointwise-in-time convergence of the fully discrete\\nscheme, which does not require any restriction on the grid ratio. Numerical\\nresults are presented to verify the accuracy of the theoretical analysis.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:30:49Z\"}"}
