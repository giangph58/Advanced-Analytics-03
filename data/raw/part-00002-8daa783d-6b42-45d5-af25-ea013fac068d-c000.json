Focusing on\\ntree-level $2\\\\to2$ processes, we analyze the leading-order amplitudes involving\\nbulk KK matter fields and KK gauge/gravitational Goldstone bosons. By imposing\\nthe gauge theory equivalence theorem (GAET) and the gravitational equivalence\\ntheorem (GRET) within warped KK theories, we systematically reconstruct the\\nleading-order amplitudes for physical KK gauge bosons and gravitons, thereby\\ncircumventing the intricate energy cancellations inherent in physical\\namplitudes. Within this framework, the correspondence between GAET and GRET\\narises as a direct manifestation of the leading-order double-copy relation in\\nthe high-energy expansion. This connection provides a foundation for extending\\nthe BCJ double-copy construction to four-point amplitudes involving bulk KK\\nmatter fields, allowing for a systematic derivation of the corresponding\\ngravitational amplitudes while consistently incorporating KK matter fields at\\nleading order.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T15:50:19Z\"}"}
