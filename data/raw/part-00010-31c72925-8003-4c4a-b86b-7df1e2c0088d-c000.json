We show\\nthat such representations enable the computation of robustly positively\\ninvariant (RPI) sets for the specified system class by solving MI linear\\nprograms. These RPI sets can subsequently be used to certify stability and\\nconstraint satisfaction. Furthermore, the approach allows to handle non-linear\\nsystems based on suitable PWA approximations and corresponding error bounds,\\nwhich can be interpreted as the bounded disturbances from above.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T12:14:20Z\"}"}
