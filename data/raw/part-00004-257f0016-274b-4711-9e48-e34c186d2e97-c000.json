{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00599v1\", \"title\": \"Visual Trajectory Prediction of Vessels for Inland Navigation\", \"summary\": \"The future of inland navigation increasingly relies on autonomous systems and\\nremote operations, emphasizing the need for accurate vessel trajectory\\nprediction. This study addresses the challenges of video-based vessel tracking\\nand prediction by integrating advanced object detection methods, Kalman\\nfilters, and spline-based interpolation. However, existing detection systems\\noften misclassify objects in inland waterways due to complex surroundings. A\\ncomparative evaluation of tracking algorithms, including BoT-SORT, Deep\\nOC-SORT, and ByeTrack, highlights the robustness of the Kalman filter in\\nproviding smoothed trajectories. Experimental results from diverse scenarios\\ndemonstrate improved accuracy in predicting vessel movements, which is\\nessential for collision avoidance and situational awareness. The findings\\nunderline the necessity of customized datasets and models for inland\\nnavigation. Future work will expand the datasets and incorporate vessel\\nclassification to refine predictions, supporting both autonomous systems and\\nhuman operators in complex environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T15:31:15Z\"}"}
