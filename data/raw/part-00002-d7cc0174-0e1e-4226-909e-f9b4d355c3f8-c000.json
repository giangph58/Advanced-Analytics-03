{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06156v1\", \"title\": \"ViTaMIn: Learning Contact-Rich Tasks Through Robot-Free Visuo-Tactile\\n  Manipulation Interface\", \"summary\": \"Tactile information plays a crucial role for humans and robots to interact\\neffectively with their environment, particularly for tasks requiring the\\nunderstanding of contact properties. Solving such dexterous manipulation tasks\\noften relies on imitation learning from demonstration datasets, which are\\ntypically collected via teleoperation systems and often demand substantial time\\nand effort. To address these challenges, we present ViTaMIn, an embodiment-free\\nmanipulation interface that seamlessly integrates visual and tactile sensing\\ninto a hand-held gripper, enabling data collection without the need for\\nteleoperation. Our design employs a compliant Fin Ray gripper with tactile\\nsensing, allowing operators to perceive force feedback during manipulation for\\nmore intuitive operation. Additionally, we propose a multimodal representation\\nlearning strategy to obtain pre-trained tactile representations, improving data\\nefficiency and policy robustness. Experiments on seven contact-rich\\nmanipulation tasks demonstrate that ViTaMIn significantly outperforms baseline\\nmethods, demonstrating its effectiveness for complex manipulation tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T15:51:18Z\"}"}
