Users have the\\npossibility to access the entire Mixed Reality (MR) continuum. Goal of the\\nhuman-computer-interaction (HCI) community is to allow natural and intuitive\\ninteractions but in general interactions for XR often rely on handheld\\ncontrollers. One natural interaction method is full body tracking (FBT), where\\na user can use their body to interact with the experience. Classically, FBT\\nsystems require markers or trackers on the users to capture motion. Recently,\\nthere have been approaches based on Human Pose Estimation (HPE), which\\nhighlight the potential of low-cost non-intrusive FBT for XR. Due to the lack\\nof handheld devices, HPE may also improve accessibility with people struggling\\nwith traditional input methods. This paper proposes the concept of\\nnon-intrusive FBT for XR for all. The goal is to spark a discussion on\\nadvantages for users by using a non-intrusive FBT system for accessibility and\\nuser experience.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T11:28:34Z\"}"}
