In this work, we provide a full quantum analogue of\\nthis lemma, which shows that the existence of a DI code in the quantum setting\\nfollows from a suitable packing in a modified space of output quantum states.\\nSpecifically, we demonstrate that such a code can be constructed using product\\nstates derived from this packing. This result enables us to tighten the\\ncapacity lower bound for DI over quantum channels beyond the simultaneous\\ndecoding approach. In particular, we can now express these bounds solely in\\nterms of the Minkowski dimension of a certain state space, giving us new\\ninsights to better understand the nature of the protocol, and the separation\\nbetween simultaneous and non-simultaneous codes. We extend the discussion with\\na particular channel example for which we can construct an optimum code.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T17:57:36Z\"}"}
