We introduce\\nan algorithm for computing underapproximate backward reachable sets of\\nnonlinear discrete time neural feedback loops. We then use the backward\\nreachable sets to check goal-reaching properties. Our algorithm is based on\\noverapproximating the system dynamics function to enable computation of\\nunderapproximate backward reachable sets through solutions of mixed-integer\\nlinear programs. We rigorously analyze the soundness of our algorithm and\\ndemonstrate it on a numerical example. Our work expands the class of properties\\nthat can be verified for learning-enabled systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.LO,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:50:43Z\"}"}
