{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07430v1\", \"title\": \"Nonlinear Optimal Guidance for Intercepting Moving Targets\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces a nonlinear optimal guidance framework for guiding a\\npursuer to intercept a moving target, with an emphasis on real-time generation\\nof optimal feedback control for a nonlinear optimal control problem. Initially,\\nconsidering the target moves without maneuvering, we derive the necessary\\noptimality conditions using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. These conditions\\nreveal that each extremal trajectory is uniquely determined by two scalar\\nparameters. Analyzing the geometric property of the parameterized extremal\\ntrajectories not only leads to an additional necessary condition but also\\nallows to establish a sufficient condition for local optimality. This enables\\nthe generation of a dataset containing at least locally optimal trajectories.\\nBy studying the properties of the optimal feedback control, the size of the\\ndataset is reduced significantly, allowing training a lightweight neural\\nnetwork to predict the optimal guidance command in real time. Furthermore, the\\nperformance of the neural network is enhanced by incorporating the target's\\nacceleration, making it suitable for intercepting both uniformly moving and\\nmaneuvering targets. Finally, numerical simulations validate the proposed\\nnonlinear optimal guidance framework, demonstrating its better performance over\\nexisting guidance laws.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T03:52:24Z\"}"}
