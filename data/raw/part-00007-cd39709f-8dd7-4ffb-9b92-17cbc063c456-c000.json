In the\\nantiferromagnetic case, the GS density manifests various patterns of\\ndistributions, including facial-makeup states, petal states, topological\\nfissure states, multiple-half-ring states and property-distinguished vertical\\nand horizonal stripe states. We notice a peculiar phenomenon of density-phase\\nseparation in the sense that the variations of density and phase tend to be\\nindependent. In ferromagnetic case, the GS exhibits a semi-circular or\\nhalf-disk status of density embedded with vortices and anti-vortices. The spin\\ndistribution can self-arrange into an array of half-skyrmions and we also find\\na half-antiskyrmion fence separating vortex-antivortex pairs. Our study\\nindicates that one can manipulate the emergence of exotic quantum states via\\nthe interplay of the SOC, interaction and potential geometry and the abundant\\nstate variations might also provide potential resources for quantum metrology.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T16:54:14Z\"}"}
