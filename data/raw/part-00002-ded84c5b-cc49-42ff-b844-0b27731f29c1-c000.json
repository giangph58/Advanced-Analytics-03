In this paper, we reframe the\\nmodel along the lines of a suitable version of (which we refer to as non quasi\\nperiodic) normal form theory and provide an explicit amount of the resonance\\ntrapping time, which is estimated as exponentially long, in terms of the small\\nparameters of the system. Key words: capture into resonance; non quasi periodic\\nnormal form theory; friction.
