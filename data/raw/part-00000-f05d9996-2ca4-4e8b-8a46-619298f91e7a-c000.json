{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04977v1\", \"title\": \"ChainMarks: Securing DNN Watermark with Cryptographic Chain\", \"summary\": \"With the widespread deployment of deep neural network (DNN) models, dynamic\\nwatermarking techniques are being used to protect the intellectual property of\\nmodel owners. However, recent studies have shown that existing watermarking\\nschemes are vulnerable to watermark removal and ambiguity attacks. Besides, the\\nvague criteria for determining watermark presence further increase the\\nlikelihood of such attacks. In this paper, we propose a secure DNN watermarking\\nscheme named ChainMarks, which generates secure and robust watermarks by\\nintroducing a cryptographic chain into the trigger inputs and utilizes a\\ntwo-phase Monte Carlo method for determining watermark presence. First,\\nChainMarks generates trigger inputs as a watermark dataset by repeatedly\\napplying a hash function over a secret key, where the target labels associated\\nwith trigger inputs are generated from the digital signature of model owner.\\nThen, the watermarked model is produced by training a DNN over both the\\noriginal and watermark datasets. To verify watermarks, we compare the predicted\\nlabels of trigger inputs with the target labels and determine ownership with a\\nmore accurate decision threshold that considers the classification probability\\nof specific models. Experimental results show that ChainMarks exhibits higher\\nlevels of robustness and security compared to state-of-the-art watermarking\\nschemes. With a better marginal utility, ChainMarks provides a higher\\nprobability guarantee of watermark presence in DNN models with the same level\\nof watermark accuracy.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T06:30:46Z\"}"}
