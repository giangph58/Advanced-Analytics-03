{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11124v1\", \"title\": \"A Unified Hardware Accelerator for Fast Fourier Transform and Number\\n  Theoretic Transform\", \"summary\": \"The Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) is an indispensable tool for computing\\nefficient polynomial multiplications in post-quantum lattice-based\\ncryptography. It has strong resemblance with the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT),\\nwhich is the most widely used algorithm in digital signal processing. In this\\nwork, we demonstrate a unified hardware accelerator supporting both 512-point\\ncomplex FFT as well as 256-point NTT for the recently standardized NIST\\npost-quantum key encapsulation and digital signature algorithms ML-KEM and\\nML-DSA respectively. Our proposed architecture effectively utilizes the\\narithmetic circuitry required for complex FFT, and the only additional circuits\\nrequired are for modular reduction along with modifications in the control\\nlogic. Our implementation achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art\\nML-KEM / ML-DSA NTT accelerators on FPGA, thus demonstrating how an FFT\\naccelerator can be augmented to support NTT and the unified hardware can be\\nused for both digital signal processing and post-quantum lattice-based\\ncryptography applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T12:13:05Z\"}"}
