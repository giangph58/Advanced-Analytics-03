Here, we study the\\nresponse of the electronic structure to optical excitations to reveal the\\neffect of chemical electron doping on this complex interplay. Transient changes\\nin pristine and electron-doped 1$T$ -TaS$_2$ are measured by femtosecond\\ntime-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and compared to theoretical modeling\\nbased on non-equilibrium dynamical mean-field theory and density functional\\ntheory. The fine changes in the oscillatory signal of the charge density wave\\namplitude mode indicate phase-dependent modifications in the Coulomb\\ninteraction and the hopping. Furthermore, we find an enhanced fraction of\\nmonolayers in the doped system. Our work demonstrates how the combination of\\ntime-resolved spectroscopy and advanced theoretical modeling provides insights\\ninto the physics of correlated transition metal dichalcogenides.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T16:33:47Z\"}"}
