{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16063v1\", \"title\": \"A Python Tool for Reconstructing Full News Text from GDELT\", \"summary\": \"News data have become an essential resource across various disciplines,\\nincluding economics, finance, management, social sciences, and computer\\nscience. Researchers leverage newspaper articles to study economic trends,\\nmarket dynamics, corporate strategies, public perception, political discourse,\\nand the evolution of public opinion. Additionally, news datasets have been\\ninstrumental in training large-scale language models, with applications in\\nsentiment analysis, fake news detection, and automated news summarization.\\nDespite their significance, access to comprehensive news corpora remains a key\\nchallenge. Many full-text news providers, such as Factiva and LexisNexis,\\nrequire costly subscriptions, while free alternatives often suffer from\\nincomplete data and transparency issues. This paper presents a novel approach\\nto obtaining full-text newspaper articles at near-zero cost by leveraging data\\nfrom the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT). Specifically,\\nwe focus on the GDELT Web News NGrams 3.0 dataset, which provides\\nhigh-frequency updates of n-grams extracted from global online news sources. We\\nprovide Python code to reconstruct full-text articles from these n-grams by\\nidentifying overlapping textual fragments and intelligently merging them. Our\\nmethod enables researchers to access structured, large-scale newspaper data for\\ntext analysis while overcoming the limitations of existing proprietary\\ndatasets. The proposed approach enhances the accessibility of news data for\\nempirical research, facilitating applications in economic forecasting,\\ncomputational social science, and natural language processing.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.DB,cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T17:40:42Z\"}"}
