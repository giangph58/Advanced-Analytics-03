This result establishes a chain of\\ninequalities of relative symplectic capacities, which is an analogue of the\\nnon-relative case. This comparison gives us a criterion for the relative almost\\nexistence theorem in terms of heaviness. Also, we investigate a sufficient\\ncondition under which the symplectic (co)homology capacity and the first\\nGutt-Hutchings capacity are equal in both non-relative and relative cases. This\\ncondition is less restrictive than the dynamical convexity.\", \"main_category\": \"math.SG\", \"categories\": \"math.SG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:20:41Z\"}"}
