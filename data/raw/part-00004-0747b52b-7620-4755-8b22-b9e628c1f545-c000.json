This damage can be identified through machine learning\\ntechniques, providing an early risk marker for potential major cardiovascular\\nevents and offering valuable insights into the overall arterial condition of\\nindividual patients. To this end, the VideoMAE deep learning model, originally\\ndeveloped for video classification, was adapted by finetuning for application\\nin the domain of ultrasound imaging. The model was trained and tested using a\\ndataset comprising over 31,000 carotid sonography videos sourced from the\\nGutenberg Health Study (15,010 participants), one of the largest prospective\\npopulation health studies. This adaptation facilitates the classification of\\nindividuals as hypertensive or non-hypertensive (75.7% validation accuracy),\\nfunctioning as a proxy for detecting visual arterial damage. We demonstrate\\nthat our machine learning model effectively captures visual features that\\nprovide valuable insights into an individual's overall cardiovascular health.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T08:38:17Z\"}"}
