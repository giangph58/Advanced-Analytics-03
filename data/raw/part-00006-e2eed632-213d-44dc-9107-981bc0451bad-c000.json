Its spin period is so close\\nto the $10^{\\\\text{th}}$ harmonic of the bright pulsar M15A ($\\\\sim$11.06647 ms)\\nand thus missed in previous pulsar search. We suggest adding the spectrum in\\nthe pulsar candidate diagnostic plot to identify new signals near the\\nharmonics. M15O has the first spin frequency derivative and the second spin\\nfrequency derivative,being 1.79191(5) $\\\\times$ $10^{-14}$ Hz $s^{-2}$ and\\n3.3133(6)$\\\\times$ $10^{-23}$ Hz $s^{-3}$, respectively. Its projected distance\\nfrom the optical centre of M15 is the closest among all the pulsars in M15. The\\norigin can be something from the center of the massive and core-collapsed\\nglobular cluster M15.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T16:46:20Z\"}"}
