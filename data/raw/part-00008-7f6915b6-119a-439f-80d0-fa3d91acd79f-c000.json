{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10350v1\", \"title\": \"Benchmarking 3D Human Pose Estimation Models Under Occlusions\", \"summary\": \"This paper addresses critical challenges in 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) by\\nanalyzing the robustness and sensitivity of existing models to occlusions,\\ncamera position, and action variability. Using a novel synthetic dataset,\\nBlendMimic3D, which includes diverse scenarios with multi-camera setups and\\nseveral occlusion types, we conduct specific tests on several state-of-the-art\\nmodels. Our study focuses on the discrepancy in keypoint formats between common\\ndatasets such as Human3.6M, and 2D datasets such as COCO, commonly used for 2D\\ndetection models and frequently input of 3D HPE models. Our work explores the\\nimpact of occlusions on model performance and the generality of models trained\\nexclusively under standard conditions. The findings suggest significant\\nsensitivity to occlusions and camera settings, revealing a need for models that\\nbetter adapt to real-world variability and occlusion scenarios. This research\\ncontributed to ongoing efforts to improve the fidelity and applicability of 3D\\nHPE systems in complex environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T16:00:25Z\"}"}
