{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09986v1\", \"title\": \"Diversity Analysis for Indoor Terahertz Communication Systems under\\n  Small-Scale Fading\", \"summary\": \"Harnessing diversity is fundamental to wireless communication systems,\\nparticularly in the terahertz (THz) band, where severe path loss and\\nsmall-scale fading pose significant challenges to system reliability and\\nperformance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive diversity analysis for\\nindoor THz communication systems, accounting for the combined effects of path\\nloss and small-scale fading, with the latter modeled as an $\\\\alpha-\\\\mu$\\ndistribution to reflect THz indoor channel conditions. We derive closed-form\\nexpressions for the bit error rate (BER) as a function of the reciprocal of the\\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and propose an asymptotic expression. Furthermore,\\nwe validate these expressions through extensive simulations, which show strong\\nagreement with the theoretical analysis, confirming the accuracy and robustness\\nof the proposed methods. Our results show that the diversity order in THz\\nsystems is primarily determined by the combined effects of the number of\\nindependent paths, the severity of fading, and the degree of channel frequency\\nselectivity, providing clear insights into how diversity gains can be optimized\\nin high-frequency wireless networks.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T08:51:52Z\"}"}
