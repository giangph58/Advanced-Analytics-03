This paper presents\\na taxonomy for distinguishing key characteristics of abusive language within\\nonline text. Our approach uses a systematic method for taxonomy development,\\nintegrating classification systems of 18 existing multi-label datasets to\\ncapture key characteristics relevant to online abusive language classification.\\nThe resulting taxonomy is hierarchical and faceted, comprising 5 categories and\\n17 dimensions. It classifies various facets of online abuse, including context,\\ntarget, intensity, directness, and theme of abuse. This shared understanding\\ncan lead to more cohesive efforts, facilitate knowledge exchange, and\\naccelerate progress in the field of online abuse detection and mitigation among\\nresearchers, policy makers, online platform owners, and other stakeholders.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:23:47Z\"}"}
