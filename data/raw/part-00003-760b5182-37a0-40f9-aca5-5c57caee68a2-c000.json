We study the class of operators \\\\[ C_{1,r} = \\\\{ T : T \\\\text{\\nis invertible and } \\\\|T\\\\|, \\\\|rT^{-1}\\\\| \\\\leq 1 \\\\}, \\\\] introduced by Bello and\\nYakubovich. Any operator $T$ for which the closed annulus\\n$\\\\overline{\\\\mathbb{A}}_r$ is a spectral set is in $C_{1,r}$. The class $C_{1,\\nr}$ is closely related to the \\\\textit{quantum annulus} which is given by \\\\[\\nQA_r = \\\\{ T : T \\\\text{ is invertible and } \\\\|rT\\\\|, \\\\|rT^{-1}\\\\| \\\\leq 1 \\\\}. \\\\]\\nMcCullough and Pascoe proved that an operator in $ QA_r $ admits a dilation to\\nan operator $ S $ satisfying $(r^{-2} + r^2)I - S^*S - S^{-1}S^{-*} = 0$. An\\nanalogous dilation result holds for operators in $ C_{1,r}$ class. We extend\\nthese dilation results to doubly commuting tuples of operators in quantum\\nannulus as well as in $C_{1,r}$ class. We also provide characterizations and\\ndecomposition results for such tuples.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T06:07:12Z\"}"}
