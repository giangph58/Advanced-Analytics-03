For braided GSAs, this setup\\nenables decoherence-free transfer and swapping of their internal entangled\\nstates. For separate GSAs, engineering coupling phases leads to state-dependent\\nchiral emission, which enables selective, directional quantum information\\ntransfer. This mechanism further facilitates remote generation of W-class\\nentangled states. Our results thereby open exciting possibilities for quantum\\nnetworks and quantum information processing.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T13:42:47Z\"}"}
