{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11321v1\", \"title\": \"Subset-Contrastive Multi-Omics Network Embedding\", \"summary\": \"Motivation: Network-based analyses of omics data are widely used, and while\\nmany of these methods have been adapted to single-cell scenarios, they often\\nremain memory- and space-intensive. As a result, they are better suited to\\nbatch data or smaller datasets. Furthermore, the application of network-based\\nmethods in multi-omics often relies on similarity-based networks, which lack\\nstructurally-discrete topologies. This limitation may reduce the effectiveness\\nof graph-based methods that were initially designed for topologies with better\\ndefined structures. Results: We propose Subset-Contrastive multi-Omics Network\\nEmbedding (SCONE), a method that employs contrastive learning techniques on\\nlarge datasets through a scalable subgraph contrastive approach. By exploiting\\nthe pairwise similarity basis of many network-based omics methods, we\\ntransformed this characteristic into a strength, developing an approach that\\naims to achieve scalable and effective analysis. Our method demonstrates\\nsynergistic omics integration for cell type clustering in single-cell data.\\nAdditionally, we evaluate its performance in a bulk multi-omics integration\\nscenario, where SCONE performs comparable to the state-of-the-art despite\\nutilising limited views of the original data. We anticipate that our findings\\nwill motivate further research into the use of subset contrastive methods for\\nomics data.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:01:39Z\"}"}
