In this article, we present general relativistic\\nmagneto-hydrodynamic simulations of binary neutron star systems on highly\\neccentric orbits. While in quasi-circular binaries, the influence of the\\nmagnetic field is too weak to affect the general pre-merger dynamics, the close\\nencounters in eccentric systems could potentially trigger magneto-hydrodynamic\\ninstabilities. Therefore, we investigate possible effects before, during, and\\nafter the merger for a total of three different systems with varying initial\\neccentricity.\\n  We study the f-mode oscillations excited by tidal interaction in close\\nencounters and find good agreement with predicted f-mode frequency estimates.\\nHowever, our simulations reveal no significant differences compared to results\\nneglecting the magnetic field. Although we observe a rearrangement of the\\npoloidal structure of the magnetic field inside the stars, there is no relevant\\nincrease in the magnetic energy during the encounters. Also, during the merger,\\nthe amplification of the magnetic field seems to be largely independent of the\\neccentricity in our systems. Consistent with studies of merging non-magnetized\\nbinary neutron stars, we find a correlation between eccentricity and mass\\nejection, with a higher impact parameter leading to a larger amount of unbound\\nmaterial.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T13:48:10Z\"}"}
