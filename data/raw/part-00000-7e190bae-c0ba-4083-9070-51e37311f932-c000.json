It is seen\\nboth in atmospheric absorption as well as in chromospheric emission, the latter\\nprobably due to the intense heating of the co-rotating planet's day-side\\nsurface. This detection cannot be explained using natural sources of alcohol,\\nimplying that there must be a technically advanced civilisation -- possibly\\noriginating from the neighboring habitable planet GJ 1132c -- that is engaged\\nin massive distilling operations accompanied by high levels of industrial\\npollution. The reason for the necessarily vast scale of production is either to\\nproduce rocket fuel for an interplanetary economy or, more likely, for an\\nunusually high level of personal consumption. The latter hypothesis suggests a\\nnovel explanation for the Fermi Paradox (the lack of indirect or direct contact\\nwith extraterrestrials): a technically versed civilisation would be incapable\\nof achieving the higher technical levels necessary for the development of a\\ndetectable radio signature -- much less interstellar travel -- at the suggested\\nrates of consumption.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,physics.soc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T07:03:23Z\"}"}
