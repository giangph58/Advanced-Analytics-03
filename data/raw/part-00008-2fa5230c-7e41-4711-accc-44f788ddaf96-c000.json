We analyze weighted fair division from an asymptotic\\nperspective: if $m$ items are divided among $n$ agents whose utilities are\\nindependently sampled from a probability distribution, when is it likely that a\\nfair allocation exist? We show that if the ratio between the weights is\\nbounded, a weighted envy-free allocation exists with high probability provided\\nthat $m = \\\\Omega(n\\\\log n/\\\\log\\\\log n)$, generalizing a prior unweighted result.\\nFor weighted proportionality, we establish a sharp threshold of $m = n/(1-\\\\mu)$\\nfor the transition from non-existence to existence, where $\\\\mu\\\\in (0,1)$\\ndenotes the mean of the distribution. In addition, we prove that for two\\nagents, a weighted envy-free (and weighted proportional) allocation is likely\\nto exist if $m = \\\\omega(\\\\sqrt{r})$, where $r$ denotes the ratio between the two\\nweights.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GT\", \"categories\": \"cs.GT,cs.DM,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T15:20:10Z\"}"}
