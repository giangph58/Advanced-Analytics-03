{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01553v1\", \"title\": \"Bhakti: A Lightweight Vector Database Management System for Endowing\\n  Large Language Models with Semantic Search Capabilities and Memory\", \"summary\": \"With the rapid development of big data and artificial intelligence\\ntechnologies, the demand for effective processing and retrieval of vector data\\nis growing. Against this backdrop, I have developed the Bhakti vector database,\\naiming to provide a lightweight and easy-to-deploy solution to meet the storage\\nand semantic search needs of small and medium-sized datasets. Bhakti supports a\\nvariety of similarity calculation methods and a domain-specific language (DSL)\\nfor document-based pattern matching pre-filtering, facilitating migration of\\ndata with its portable data files, flexible data management and seamless\\nintegration with Python3. Furthermore, I propose a memory-enhanced large\\nlanguage model dialogue solution based on the Bhakti database, which can assign\\ndifferent weights to the question and answer in dialogue history, achieving\\nfine-grained control over the semantic importance of each segment in a single\\ndialogue history. Through experimental validation, my method shows significant\\nperformance in the application of semantic search and question-answering\\nsystems. Although there are limitations in processing large datasets, such as\\nnot supporting approximate calculation methods like HNSW, the lightweight\\nnature of Bhakti gives it a clear advantage in scenarios involving small and\\nmedium-sized datasets.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DB\", \"categories\": \"cs.DB\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T09:52:54Z\"}"}
