Despite\\nextensive research, challenges remain due to the diverse shapes and properties\\nof target objects, inaccuracies in sensing, and potential collisions with the\\nenvironment. In this work, we propose a method for effectively grasping in\\ncluttered bin-picking environments where these challenges intersect. We utilize\\na multi-functional gripper that combines both suction and finger grasping to\\nhandle a wide range of objects. We also present an active gripper adaptation\\nstrategy to minimize collisions between the gripper hardware and the\\nsurrounding environment by actively leveraging the reciprocating suction cup\\nand reconfigurable finger motion. To fully utilize the gripper's capabilities,\\nwe built a neural network that detects suction and finger grasp points from a\\nsingle input RGB-D image. This network is trained using a larger-scale\\nsynthetic dataset generated from simulation. In addition to this, we propose an\\nefficient approach to constructing a real-world dataset that facilitates grasp\\npoint detection on various objects with diverse characteristics. Experiment\\nresults show that the proposed method can grasp objects in cluttered\\nbin-picking scenarios and prevent collisions with environmental constraints\\nsuch as a corner of the bin. Our proposed method demonstrated its effectiveness\\nin the 9th Robotic Grasping and Manipulation Competition (RGMC) held at ICRA\\n2024.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T16:12:28Z\"}"}
