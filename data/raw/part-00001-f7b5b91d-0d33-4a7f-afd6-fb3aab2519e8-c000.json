Excitation to Rydberg states induces a redistribution of image\\ncharges on capacitively coupled electrodes, giving rise to a quantum\\ncapacitance. By applying frequency-modulated resonant microwaves to drive the\\nRydberg transition, we systematically measured a capacitance sensitivity of\\n0.38~aF/$\\\\sqrt{\\\\mathrm{Hz}}$. This level of sensitivity is sufficient to\\nresolve the Rydberg transition of a single electron, providing a scalable\\npathway toward the implementation of qubit readout schemes based on surface\\nelectrons on helium.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T05:33:35Z\"}"}
