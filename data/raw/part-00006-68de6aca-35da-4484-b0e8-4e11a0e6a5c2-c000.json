To achieve this, we use a VQC based on a single qudit,\\nand encode the classical data into the VQC via a trainable hybrid autoencoder\\nwhich has been recently proposed as embedding technique. Our results highlight\\nthe importance of tailored data pre-processing for the circuit and show the\\npotential of qudit-based VQCs.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:53:27Z\"}"}
