In particular, we discuss the\\nimplementation details and the challenges that arise when utilizing a dynamical\\ninfrared cutoff parameter. Additionally, we combine the subtraction with the\\nprojection-to-Born method in order to include fiducial power corrections. As a\\ntest case, we provide predictions for Drell-Yan and $Z$+jet production at the\\nLHC, using $N$-jettiness as resolution variable. We validate the NNLO\\ncorrections of GENEVA against NNLOJET finding excellent agreement. Finally, we\\ndiscuss how to extend our method to calculate the N$^3$LO QCD\\nfully-differential corrections to colour-singlet production at hadron\\ncolliders.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:26:01Z\"}"}
