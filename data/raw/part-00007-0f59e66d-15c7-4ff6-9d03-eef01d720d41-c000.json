{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15149v1\", \"title\": \"Cosmological Constraints with Void Lensing I: the Simulation-Based\\n  Inference Framework\", \"summary\": \"We present a Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) framework for cosmological\\nparameter estimation via void lensing analysis. Despite the absence of an\\nanalytical model of void lensing, SBI can effectively learn posterior\\ndistributions through forward modeling of mock data. We develop a forward\\nmodeling pipeline that accounts for both cosmology and the galaxy-halo\\nconnection. By training a neural density estimator on simulated data, we infer\\nthe posteriors of two cosmological parameters, $\\\\Omega_m$ and $S_8$. Validation\\ntests are conducted on posteriors derived from different cosmological\\nparameters and a fiducial sample. The results demonstrate that SBI provides\\nunbiased estimates of mean values and accurate uncertainties. These findings\\nhighlight the potential to apply void lensing analysis to observational data\\neven without an analytical void lensing model.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T14:52:56Z\"}"}
