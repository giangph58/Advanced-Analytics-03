Instead of the trial-and-error\\nmethod, it is efficient to design and prepare single-phase face-centered cubic\\n(FCC) structured HEAs using semi-empirical phase formation rules. However,\\nalmost all of phase formation rules were proposed without taking into account\\nthe cobalt-free situation. The HEAs containing cobalt are unsuitable for\\nnuclear applications because of the long-term activation of cobalt. Here, six\\nparameters, d-orbital energy level, valance electron concentration, entropy of\\nmixing, enthalpy of mixing, atom size differences, and parameter of the entropy\\nof mixing ({\\\\Omega}) were calculated to determine the solid solution phase,\\nespecially the FCC phase formation rules in cobalt-free HEAs. HEAs of 4\\ncomponents were arc melted to verify the newly developed phase formation rules.\\nThe nanomechanical properties of produced HEAs were evaluated using\\nnanoindentation. Among the six parameters, the d-orbital energy level and\\nvalance electron concentration are the critical factors that determine the FCC\\nphase stability in cobalt-free alloys. Interestingly, the d-orbital energy\\nlevel can be alone used as a benchmark for developing mechanical properties.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T07:20:32Z\"}"}
