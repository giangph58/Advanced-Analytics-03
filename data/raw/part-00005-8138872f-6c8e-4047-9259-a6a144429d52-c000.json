In this paper, we develop a mathematical\\nframework for SemCom based on category theory, rigorously model the concepts of\\nsemantic entities and semantic probability space. Within this framework,\\nsemantic entropy is introduced to quantify the uncertainty of semantic\\nentities. We theoretically prove that semantic entropy can be effectively\\nreduced by exploiting KB, which capture semantic dependencies. Specifically,\\nsemantic entities can be combined based on semantic ambiguity, and are encoded\\nbased on contextual relationships among them. Then we refine semantic channel\\ncapacity modeling, which considers the mutual information contained in KB to\\nbetter reflect SemCom efficiency. Numerical simulations validate the\\neffectiveness of the proposed framework, showing that SemCom with KB\\nintegration outperforms traditional communication in both entropy reduction and\\ncoding efficiency.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI,cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T16:07:33Z\"}"}
