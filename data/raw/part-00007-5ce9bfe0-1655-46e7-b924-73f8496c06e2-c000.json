Building upon the work of Kaarnioja,\\nKazashi, Kuo, Nobile, Sloan (Numer. Math., 2022) on kernel interpolation with\\nquasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) lattice point sets, we leverage multilevel techniques\\nto enhance computational efficiency while maintaining a given level of\\naccuracy. In the function space setting with product-type weight parameters,\\nthe single-level approximation can achieve an accuracy of $\\\\varepsilon>0$ with\\ncost $\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\varepsilon^{-\\\\eta-\\\\nu-\\\\theta})$ for positive constants\\n$\\\\eta, \\\\nu, \\\\theta $ depending on the rates of convergence associated with\\ndimension truncation, kernel approximation, and finite element approximation,\\nrespectively. Our multilevel approximation can achieve the same $\\\\varepsilon$\\naccuracy at a reduced cost $\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\varepsilon^{-\\\\eta-\\\\max(\\\\nu,\\\\theta)})$.\\nFull regularity theory and error analysis are provided, followed by numerical\\nexperiments that validate the efficacy of the proposed multilevel approximation\\nin comparison to the single-level approach.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T11:49:51Z\"}"}
