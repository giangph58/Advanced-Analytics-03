This study\\ninvestigated the impact of different CT-to-RED calibration curves on brain\\ncancer treatment plans. Three calibration curves were compared: CIRS\\nphantom-derived, Catphan phantom-derived, and the default curve in the Monaco\\nTreatment Planning System. Ten volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans\\nwere generated and recalculated using each curve. Dosimetric parameters for\\nPlanning Target Volume (PTV) and Organs at Risk (OARs) were analyzed. Results\\nshowed significant differences in PTV dose distribution between the\\nCIRS-derived and default curves, while no significant differences were found\\nbetween Catphan-derived and default curves. The CIRS-derived curve demonstrated\\nsuperior performance in representing brain tissue electron densities. These\\nfindings emphasize the importance of using site-specific CT-to-RED calibration\\ncurves for accurate dose calculations in brain radiotherapy, potentially\\nimproving treatment safety and efficacy\", \"main_category\": \"physics.med-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.med-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:24:57Z\"}"}
