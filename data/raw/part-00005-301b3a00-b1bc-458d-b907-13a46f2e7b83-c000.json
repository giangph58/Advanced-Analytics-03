The Large Hadron Collider delivered\\nproton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $13\\\\,\\\\textrm{TeV}$\\nbetween 2015 and 2018, which were recorded by the ATLAS detector, corresponding\\nto an integrated luminosity of $140\\\\,\\\\textrm{fb}^{-1}$. The total\\ncross-sections for Higgs boson production by gluon-gluon fusion and\\nvector-boson fusion times the $H\\\\rightarrow WW^\\\\ast$ branching ratio are\\nmeasured to be $12.4^{+1.3}_{-1.2}\\\\,\\\\textrm{pb}$ and\\n$0.79^{+0.18}_{-0.16}\\\\,\\\\textrm{pb}$, respectively, in agreement with the\\nStandard Model predictions. Higgs boson production is further characterised\\nthrough measurements of Simplified Template Cross-Sections in a total of\\nfifteen kinematic fiducial regions. A new scheme of kinematic fiducial regions\\nhas been introduced to enhance the sensitivity to CP-violating effects in Higgs\\nboson interactions. Both schemes are used to constrain CP-even and CP-odd\\ndimension-six operators in the Standard Model effective field theory.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T12:15:04Z\"}"}
