Despite\\ntheir prevalence, visualization of Reeb graphs has received less attention. In\\nthis paper, we bridge an essential gap in the literature by exploring the\\ncomplexity of drawing Reeb graphs. Specifically, we demonstrate that Reeb graph\\ncrossing number minimization is NP-hard, both for straight-line and curve\\nrepresentations of edges. On the other hand, we identify specific classes of\\nReeb graphs, namely paths and caterpillars, for which crossing-free drawings\\nexist. We also give an optimal algorithm for drawing cycle-shaped Reeb graphs\\nwith the least number of crossings and provide initial observations on the\\ncomplexities of drawing multi-cycle Reeb graphs. We hope that this work\\nestablishes the foundation for an understanding of the graph drawing challenges\\ninherent in Reeb graph visualization and paves the way for future work in this\\narea.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CG\", \"categories\": \"cs.CG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T05:35:04Z\"}"}
