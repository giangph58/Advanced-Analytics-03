Enzyme-mediated catalysis allows the various\\ntransformations to proceed at biologically relevant rates with remarkable\\nprecision and efficiency. Theory, experiments and computational studies\\ncoincide to show that local frustration is a useful concept to relate protein\\ndynamics with catalytic power. Local frustration gives rise to the asperities\\nof the energy landscapes that can harness the thermal fluctuations to guide the\\nfunctional protein motions. We review here recent advances into these\\nrelationships from various fields of protein science. The biologically relevant\\ndynamics is tuned by the evolution of protein sequences that modulate the local\\nfrustration patterns to near optimal values.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.BM\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.BM,cond-mat.soft,physics.bio-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T15:32:15Z\"}"}
