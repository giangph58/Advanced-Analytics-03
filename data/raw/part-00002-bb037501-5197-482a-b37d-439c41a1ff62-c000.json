{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05014v1\", \"title\": \"Review of analytic results on quasinormal modes of black holes\", \"summary\": \"We present a concise review of known analytic results for quasinormal modes\\nof black holes and related spacetimes. Our emphasis is on those regimes where\\nthe perturbation equations admit exact or perturbative solutions, providing\\ninsights complementary to numerical or semi-analytic approaches. We discuss\\nsolvable cases in lower-dimensional spacetimes, algebraically special modes,\\nand exact results in higher-curvature gravity theories. Particular attention is\\ngiven to the eikonal regime and its correspondence with null geodesics, as well\\nas to beyond-eikonal approximations based on inverse multipole expansions in\\nparametrized metrics. We review analytic solutions obtained in the\\nnear-extremal limit of Schwarzschild - de Sitter black holes, in the regime of\\nlarge field mass, and in pure de Sitter and anti - de Sitter spacetimes, where\\nboundary conditions play a crucial role. While not exhaustive, this overview\\nhighlights the diversity of techniques and physical insights made possible by\\nanalytic treatments of quasinormal spectra.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:39:23Z\"}"}
