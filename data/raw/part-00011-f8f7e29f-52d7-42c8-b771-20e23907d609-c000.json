{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02637v1\", \"title\": \"Medium Access for Push-Pull Data Transmission in 6G Wireless Systems\", \"summary\": \"Medium access in 5G systems was tailored to accommodate diverse traffic\\nclasses through network resource slicing. 6G wireless systems are expected to\\nbe significantly reliant on Artificial Intelligence (AI), leading to\\ndata-driven and goal-oriented communication. This leads to augmentation of the\\ndesign space for Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols, which is the focus of\\nthis article. We introduce a taxonomy based on push-based and pull-based\\ncommunication, which is useful to categorize both the legacy and the AI-driven\\naccess schemes. We provide MAC protocol design guidelines for pull- and\\npush-based communication in terms of goal-oriented criteria, such as timing and\\ndata relevance. We articulate a framework for co-existence between pull and\\npush-based communications in 6G systems, combining their advantages. We\\nhighlight the design principles and main tradeoffs, as well as the\\narchitectural considerations for integrating these designs in Open-Radio Access\\nNetwork (O-RAN) and 6G systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:34:38Z\"}"}
