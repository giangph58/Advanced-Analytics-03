{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21849v1\", \"title\": \"Public Opinion and The Rise of Digital Minds: Perceived Risk, Trust, and\\n  Regulation Support\", \"summary\": \"Governance institutions must respond to societal risks, including those posed\\nby generative AI. This study empirically examines how public trust in\\ninstitutions and AI technologies, along with perceived risks, shape preferences\\nfor AI regulation. Using the nationally representative 2023 Artificial\\nIntelligence, Morality, and Sentience (AIMS) survey, we assess trust in\\ngovernment, AI companies, and AI technologies, as well as public support for\\nregulatory measures such as slowing AI development or outright bans on advanced\\nAI. Our findings reveal broad public support for AI regulation, with risk\\nperception playing a significant role in shaping policy preferences.\\nIndividuals with higher trust in government favor regulation, while those with\\ngreater trust in AI companies and AI technologies are less inclined to support\\nrestrictions. Trust in government and perceived risks significantly predict\\npreferences for both soft (e.g., slowing development) and strong (e.g., banning\\nAI systems) regulatory interventions. These results highlight the importance of\\npublic opinion in AI governance. As AI capabilities advance, effective\\nregulation will require balancing public concerns about risks with trust in\\ninstitutions. This study provides a foundational empirical baseline for\\npolicymakers navigating AI governance and underscores the need for further\\nresearch into public trust, risk perception, and regulatory strategies in the\\nevolving AI landscape.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY,cs.AI,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:56:23Z\"}"}
