Although seemingly simple, this temperature\\ndependence is incompatible with the conventional theory of metals that dictates\\nthat the scattering rate, $1/\\\\tau$, should be quadratic in temperature if\\nelectron-electron scattering dominates. Understanding the origin of this\\ntemperature dependence and its connection to superconductivity may provide the\\nkey to pick the lock of high-temperature superconductivity. Using time-domain\\nterahertz spectroscopy (TDTS) we elucidate the low temperature conducting\\nbehavior of two FeTe$_{1-x}$Se$_x$ (FTS) samples, one with almost equal amounts\\nof Se and Te that is believed to be a topological superconductor, and one that\\nis more overdoped. Constrained with DC resistivity, we find two conduction\\nchannels that add in parallel, a broad one in frequency with weak temperature\\ndependence and a sharper one whose scattering rate goes as the Planckian\\nlimited rate, $\\\\sim kT/h$. Through analysis of its spectral weight we show the\\nsuperconducting condensate is mainly drawn from the channel that undergoes this\\nPlanckian scattering.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T16:04:27Z\"}"}
