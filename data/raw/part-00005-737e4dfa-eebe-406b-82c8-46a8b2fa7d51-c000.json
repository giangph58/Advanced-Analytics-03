{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13117v1\", \"title\": \"Tunable Entangling and Steering of Ferrimagnetic Magnons via an\\n  OptoMagnoMechanical Ring\", \"summary\": \"Recently, magnomechanical systems have emerged as promising platforms for\\nquantum technologies, exploiting magnon-photon-phonon interactions to store\\nhigh-fidelity quantum information. In this paper, we propose a scheme to\\nentangle two spatially separated ferrimagnetic YIG crystals by injecting a\\nmicrowave field into an optomagnonic ring cavity. The proposed\\noptomagnomechanical configuration utilizes the coupling between\\nmagnetostriction-induced mechanical displacements and the optical cavity via\\nradiation pressure. Magnons - collective spin excitations in macroscopic\\nferromagnets - are directly driven by an electromagnetic field. We demonstrate\\nthe generation of macroscopic magnon entanglement by exciting the optical\\ncavity with a red detuned microwave field and the YIG crystals with a blue\\ndetuned field. Our analysis reveals that magnon entanglement vanishes for\\nidentical magnomechanical couplings but remains robust against thermal\\nfluctuations. The magnon modes entangled in two ferrimagnetic crystals\\nrepresent genuine macroscopic quantum states with potential applications in the\\nstudy of macroscopic quantum mechanics and quantum information processing based\\non magnonics. The configuration is based on experimentally accessible\\nparameters, providing a feasible route of quantum technologies.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T17:36:37Z\"}"}
