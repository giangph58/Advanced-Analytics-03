However, the detailed\\nexploration of how domestic workers use these technologies remains limited.\\nThis study examines the impact of online technologies on domestic workers' work\\npractices, perceptions, and relationships with customers and employers. We\\ninterviewed 30 domestic workers residing in the United States, who provided\\nexamples that highlight the insufficient transformative role of current online\\ntechnologies in their work. By conducting a thematic analysis, we characterize\\nhow they approach and avoid these digital tools at different stages of their\\nwork. Through these findings, we investigate the limitations of technology and\\nidentify challenges and opportunities that could inform the design of more\\nsuitable tools to improve the conditions of this marginalized group.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T14:29:25Z\"}"}
