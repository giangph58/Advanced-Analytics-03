This process can serve as a useful model to better understand\\nprotein denaturation in general. Using x-ray holographic tomography, we\\ninvestigated the structural changes in egg yolk during boiling without the need\\nfor complex sample fixation or drying. Our results reveal a developing\\nseparation between proteins and lipids, with fatty components rapidly\\naggregating into large globules that subsequently evolve into bubbles.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:35:25Z\"}"}
