From this, we\\ndeduce several metric and topological consequences: $M$ has at most linear\\nvolume growth and at most two ends, the first Betti number of $M$ is bounded\\nabove by $1$, and there is precise information on elements of infinite order in\\n$\\\\pi_1(M)$.\\n  If $(M^n,g)$ is a Riemannian manifold satisfying such bounds for $k\\\\geq 2$\\nand additionally the Ricci curvature is asymptotically non-negative, then we\\nshow that $M$ has at most $(k-1)$-dimensional behavior at large scales. If\\n$k=n={\\\\rm dim}(M)$, so that the integral lower bound is on the scalar\\ncurvature, assuming in addition that the $n-2$-Ricci curvature is\\nasymptotically non-negative, then we prove that the dimension drop at large\\nscales improves to $n-2$. From the above results, we deduce topological\\nrestrictions, such as upper bounds on the first Betti number.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG,math.MG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:13:24Z\"}"}
