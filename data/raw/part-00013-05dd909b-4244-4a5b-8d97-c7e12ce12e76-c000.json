{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11078v1\", \"title\": \"Dynamical Measurement of Supermassive Black Hole Masses: QPE Timing\\n  Method\", \"summary\": \"Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are intense repeating soft X-ray bursts with\\nrecurrence times about a few hours to a few weeks from galactic nuclei. More\\nand more analyses show that (at least a fraction of) QPEs are the result of\\ncollisions between a stellar mass object (SMO, a stellar mass black hole or a\\nmain sequence star) and an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole\\n(SMBH) in galactic nuclei. Previous studies have shown that the SMO trajectory\\ncan be reconstructed from QPE timing data, consequently the SMBH mass can be\\nrobustly measured from tracing a single SMO. In this Letter, we construct a\\ncomprehensive Bayesian framework for implementing the QPE timing method,\\nexplore the optimal QPE observation strategy for measuring SMBH masses, and\\nforecast the measurement precision expected in the era of multi-target X-ray\\ntelescope, Chasing All Transients Constellation Hunters (CATCH). As a result,\\nwe find the QPE timing method is of great potential in precise measurement of\\nSMBH masses (and spins), especially in the lower mass end ($\\\\lesssim 10^7\\nM_\\\\odot$) where QPEs prevail and relevant dynamical timescales are reasonably\\nshort to be measured.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T11:22:20Z\"}"}
