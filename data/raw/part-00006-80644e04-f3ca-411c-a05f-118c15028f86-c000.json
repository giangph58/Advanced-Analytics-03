Our\\nprevious studies showed that the formulation is unconditionally stable in time\\nand that its mixed finite element discretization is well-posed. In this paper,\\nwe analyze the behavior of the condition number with respect to mesh\\nrefinement. Moreover, we observe that our formulation does not need any\\nstabilization term in presence of small cut cells and conditioning is not\\naffected by the interface position.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T13:18:41Z\"}"}
