We consider the case when\\nthe floating is supposed to be an infinite circular cylinder, so that the\\nequations of the free surface of the fluid can be written in one space\\ndimension. The governing equations are formulated as an abstract evolution\\nequation in a suitable Hilbert space, and we establish the well-posedness of\\nthe associated initial value problem. A key element of the proof is the\\nanalysis of a partial Dirichlet-to-Neumann map on an unbounded domain with a\\nnon-smooth boundary.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T08:06:23Z\"}"}
