In this brief\\npaper we present a counter-argument based upon a thought experiment and\\nsemi-formal considerations leading to an inherent ambiguity barrier which\\nprevents LLMs from having any understanding of what their amazingly fluent\\ndialogues mean.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T16:55:44Z\"}"}
