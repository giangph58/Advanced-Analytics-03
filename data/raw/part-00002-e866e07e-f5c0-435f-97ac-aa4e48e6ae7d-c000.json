Building upon the fundamental\\nwork of Fiacco, it derives the sensitivity of primal-dual solutions for regular\\nnonlinear programs and explores the extent to which Fiacco's framework can be\\nextended to degenerate nonlinear programs with non-unique dual solutions. The\\nsurvey ends with a discussion on how to adapt the sensitivity analysis for\\nconic programs and approximate solutions obtained from interior-point\\nalgorithms.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T12:45:36Z\"}"}
