To this end, we compare monolingual with bilingual evaluations (with\\nsource text), under two scenarios: the evaluation of a single MT system, and\\nthe comparative evaluation of pairwise MT systems. Four professional\\ntranslators performed both monolingual and bilingual evaluations by assigning\\nratings and annotating errors, and providing feedback on their experience. Our\\nfindings suggest that context-aware monolingual human evaluation achieves\\ncomparable outcomes to human bilingual evaluations, and suggest the feasibility\\nand potential of monolingual evaluation as an efficient approach to assessing\\nMT.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T12:13:58Z\"}"}
