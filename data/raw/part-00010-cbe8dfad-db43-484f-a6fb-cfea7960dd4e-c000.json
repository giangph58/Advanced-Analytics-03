{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01842v1\", \"title\": \"shapr: Explaining Machine Learning Models with Conditional Shapley\\n  Values in R and Python\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces the shapr package, a versatile tool for generating\\nShapley value explanations for machine learning and statistical regression\\nmodels in both R and Python. The package emphasizes conditional Shapley value\\nestimates, providing a comprehensive range of approaches for accurately\\ncapturing feature dependencies, which is crucial for correct model\\ninterpretation and lacking in similar software. In addition to regular tabular\\ndata, the shapr R-package includes specialized functionality for explaining\\ntime series forecasts. The package offers a minimal set of user functions with\\nsensible defaults for most use cases while providing extensive flexibility for\\nadvanced users to fine-tune computations. Additional features include\\nparallelized computations, iterative estimation with convergence detection, and\\nrich visualization tools. shapr also extends its functionality to compute\\ncausal and asymmetric Shapley values when causal information is available. In\\naddition, we introduce the shaprpy Python library, which brings core\\ncapabilities of shapr to the Python ecosystem. Overall, the package aims to\\nenhance the interpretability of predictive models within a powerful and\\nuser-friendly framework.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,stat.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:47:30Z\"}"}
