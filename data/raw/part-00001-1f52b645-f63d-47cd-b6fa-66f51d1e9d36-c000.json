These results are based on\\n4,270 days of data collected by Super-Kamiokande, including 564 days with 0.011\\nwt\\\\% gadolinium added to enhance neutron detection. The measurements are\\ncompared to predictions from neutrino event generators combined with various\\nhadron-nucleus interaction models, which consist of an intranuclear cascade\\nmodel and a nuclear de-excitation model. We observe significant variations in\\nthe predictions depending on the choice of hadron-nucleus interaction model. We\\ndiscuss key factors that contribute to describing our data, such as in-medium\\neffects in the intranuclear cascade and the accuracy of statistical evaporation\\nmodeling.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T13:46:23Z\"}"}
