{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01705v1\", \"title\": \"Sky of Unlearning (SoUL): Rewiring Federated Machine Unlearning via\\n  Selective Pruning\", \"summary\": \"The Internet of Drones (IoD), where drones collaborate in data collection and\\nanalysis, has become essential for applications such as surveillance and\\nenvironmental monitoring. Federated learning (FL) enables drones to train\\nmachine learning models in a decentralized manner while preserving data\\nprivacy. However, FL in IoD networks is susceptible to attacks like data\\npoisoning and model inversion. Federated unlearning (FU) mitigates these risks\\nby eliminating adversarial data contributions, preventing their influence on\\nthe model. This paper proposes sky of unlearning (SoUL), a federated unlearning\\nframework that efficiently removes the influence of unlearned data while\\nmaintaining model performance. A selective pruning algorithm is designed to\\nidentify and remove neurons influential in unlearning but minimally impact the\\noverall performance of the model. Simulations demonstrate that SoUL outperforms\\nexisting unlearning methods, achieves accuracy comparable to full retraining,\\nand reduces computation and communication overhead, making it a scalable and\\nefficient solution for resource-constrained IoD networks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.MA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T13:07:30Z\"}"}
