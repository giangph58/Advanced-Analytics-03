In this\\ncompact paper, we consider the graviton emission part of these radiations and\\nassume that these graviton signals can exist in the current universe in the\\nform of gravitational waves. We predict an energy density parameter of\\n$\\\\log_{10}(\\\\Omega_{\\\\rm GW} h^2) \\\\sim \\\\mathscr{O}(-25) - \\\\mathscr{O}(-30)$ and\\nits associated peak frequency $\\\\log_{10}(f_{\\\\rm peak}^0) \\\\sim\\n\\\\mathscr{O}(6)-\\\\mathscr{O}(5)$, depending on the reheating temperature. These\\nsignals occupy a frequency band below the ultrahigh-frequency regime and\\npossess a detectable energy density, offering a promising target for future\\ngravitational wave observatories. We believe that the detection of such signals\\nwould provide a compelling test of Hawking's radiation theory in a cosmological\\ncontext.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.CO,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T13:19:40Z\"}"}
