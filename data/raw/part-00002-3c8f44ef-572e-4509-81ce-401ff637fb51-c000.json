We show that for small finite-size specimens, boundary\\neffects can play a major role, so that the RRMM needs an enrichment to capture\\nthe metamaterial's bulk response, as well as the boundary effects. A benchmark\\ntest is introduced to show that different metamaterial/ homogeneous material\\ninterfaces can drive completely different responses even if the bulk\\nmetamaterial remains the same. We show with no remaining doubts that the\\nconcept of \\\"interface forces\\\" must necessarily be introduced if one wants to\\nmodel finite-size metamaterials in a homogenized framework.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.app-ph,J.2\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:42:04Z\"}"}
