By combining a previously introduced simple model and prior\\ntheoretical results, we derive a formula for the inverse mean free path, $1 /\\n\\\\ell$, which allows us to estimate the mean free path of $d$-wave\\nquasiparticles in Hg1223 below $T_c$. We find that $1 / \\\\ell$ grows as $T^3$,\\nin agreement with the theoretical expectation for a clean $d$-wave\\nsuperconductor. Measurements were also conducted on the single layer\\nmercury-based cuprate HgBa$_2$CuO$_{6+\\\\delta}$ (Hg1201), revealing that the\\nmean free path in this compound is roughly half that of its three-layered\\ncounterpart at the same doping ($p$ = 0.10). This observation can be attributed\\nto the protective role of the outer planes in Hg1223, which results in a more\\npristine inner plane. We also report data in an ultraclean crystal of\\nYBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ (YBCO) with full oxygen content $p$ = 0.18, believed to be\\nthe cleanest of any cuprate, and find that $\\\\ell$ is not longer than in Hg1223.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:45:57Z\"}"}
