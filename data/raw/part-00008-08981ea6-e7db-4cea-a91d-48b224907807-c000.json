The definition is spinorial and based on work for\\nvanishing cosmological constant by Penrose and Dougan & Mason. Furthermore,\\nthis mass is non-negative, equal to the Misner-Sharp mass in spherical\\nsymmetry, equal to zero for every generic surface in AdS, has an appropriate\\nform for gravity linearised about AdS and has an appropriate limit for large\\nspheres in asymptotically AdS spacetimes.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th,math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T11:07:23Z\"}"}
