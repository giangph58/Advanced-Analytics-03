General arguments\\nsuggest that a charge can be assigned to them and that its evolution is\\ngoverned by the law of periodic charge oscillations. We discuss an elegant\\nanalytically-solvable example of a field configuration in the Proca theory\\nrespecting such a law. We also identify a weak point in the aforementioned\\ngeneral arguments, construct the counterexample to the law of periodic charge\\noscillations in the Proca theory, and comprehensively discuss it. The\\nGibbs-Wilbraham phenomenon is discussed in the course of these studies.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:25:17Z\"}"}
