In this work, we\\npresent analytical descriptions for the shape, thickness and interference\\npattern of higher-order inner photon rings. By taking the static spherically\\nsymmetric Schwarzschild star with a photon sphere as an example, we find that\\nits inner photon rings can be more non-circular and thicker than the outer\\nones, and show that the inclusion of the inner photon rings can give rise to\\nnew features in the interferometric pattern. Our formulae can also be applied\\nto other ultracompact objects, providing a convenient way to study the\\nobservational properties of their higher-order photon rings.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T13:49:44Z\"}"}
