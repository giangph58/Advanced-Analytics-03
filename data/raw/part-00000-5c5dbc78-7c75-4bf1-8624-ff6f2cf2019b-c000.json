In this review, we introduce a simplified\\nmathematical framework that integrates the Landau-de Gennes free energy for\\nnematic ordering with the Cahn-Hilliard free energy for phase separation. We\\nderive the corresponding governing equations and analyze the stability of\\nuniform phases, along with the resulting interfacial phenomena. The review\\nconcludes with a brief discussion highlighting key differences in phase\\nseparation between mixtures of isotropic fluids with passive and active\\nnematics.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:55:42Z\"}"}
