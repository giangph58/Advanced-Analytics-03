Using numerical simulations, we show that these strings preferentially\\nattach to matter halos, leading to the stabilization of string loops. While the\\nrequirement for screening of fifth-force interactions in the solar system\\nlimits observable signatures in theories with universal coupling to matter,\\nanalogous topological defects in the dark sector may still influence cosmic\\nstructure formation, offering a novel avenue to constrain dark-sector\\ninteractions.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:33:14Z\"}"}
