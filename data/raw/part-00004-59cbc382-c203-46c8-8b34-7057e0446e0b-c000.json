In particular,\\nmultiple rescatterings of an incoming parton by the nuclear target are known to\\ninduce the radiation of many soft gluons, with those having a long formation\\ntime leading to the modification of hadron production rates due to fully\\ncoherent energy loss (FCEL). Here we present a recently derived formula for the\\ninduced single soft gluon radiation spectrum beyond leading logarithmic\\naccuracy, whose main features are demonstrated with the example of $q\\\\, g \\\\to\\nq\\\\, g$ scattering.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T12:07:39Z\"}"}
