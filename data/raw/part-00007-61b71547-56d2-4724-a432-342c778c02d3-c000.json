{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14959v1\", \"title\": \"ScaleGuard: Rational and Scalable Configuration Privacy Protection with\\n  Topology Expansion\", \"summary\": \"As networks grow in size and complexity, safeguarding sensitive data while\\nsharing configuration files is critical for network management and research.\\nExisting anonymization tools primarily hide fields like IP addresses or AS\\nnumbers to mitigate direct data exposure. However, they often lack mechanisms\\nto preserve privacy around network scale, an increasingly sensitive aspect that\\ncan reveal organizational size or resource distribution. We propose ScaleGuard,\\nwhich preserves network functional equivalence while adding fake routers and\\nhosts to conceal network scale, and generating complete router configurations\\nthat resemble the originals. Our system introduces a graph embedding-based\\nexpansion method and k-degree mapping anonymity, reducing unnecessary topology\\nmodifications when adversaries only know the original degree sequence. For\\nrouting repair, ScaleGuard designs a network repair framework combining SMT and\\niterative methods, delivering stable performance under randomized link costs\\nand complex cross-protocol routing. Experiment results show that ScaleGuard\\nexpands network scale effectively, providing consistent anonymization of\\ntopology, scale, and routing, while achieving strong topological rationality,\\nconfiguration fidelity, and repairing efficiency.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T08:38:52Z\"}"}
