To investigate this issue, we conducted an exploratory focus group\\nstudy with 16 senior participants, from which we derived an initial set of user\\npersonas highlighting key accessibility and personalisation barriers. These\\npersonas informed the development of a model-driven engineering toolset, which\\nwas used to generate adaptive mobile app prototypes tailored to seniors' needs.\\nWe then conducted a second focus group study with 22 seniors to evaluate these\\nprototypes and validate our findings. Based on insights from both studies, we\\ndeveloped a refined set of personas and a series of accessibility and\\npersonalisation recommendations grounded in empirical data, prior research,\\naccessibility standards, and developer resources, aimed at supporting software\\npractitioners in designing more inclusive mobile applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T06:32:05Z\"}"}
