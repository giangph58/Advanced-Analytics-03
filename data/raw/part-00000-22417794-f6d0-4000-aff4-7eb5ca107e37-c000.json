Live imaging is an important technique to visualize\\nand quantify elemental processes in plant development. To uncover novel\\ntheories underlying plant growth and cell division, accurate cell tracking on\\nlive imaging is of utmost importance. The commonly used cell tracking software,\\nTrackMate, adopts tracking-by-detection fashion, which applies Laplacian of\\nGaussian (LoG) for blob detection, and Linear Assignment Problem (LAP) tracker\\nfor tracking. However, they do not perform sufficiently when cells are densely\\narranged. To alleviate the problems mentioned above, we propose an accurate\\ntracking method based on Genetic algorithm (GA) using knowledge of Arabidopsis\\nroot cellular patterns and spatial relationship among volumes. Our method can\\nbe described as a coarse-to-fine method, in which we first conducted relatively\\neasy line-level tracking of cell nuclei, then performed complicated nuclear\\ntracking based on known linear arrangement of cell files and their spatial\\nrelationship between nuclei. Our method has been evaluated on a long-time live\\nimaging dataset of Arabidopsis root tips, and with minor manual rectification,\\nit accurately tracks nuclei. To the best of our knowledge, this research\\nrepresents the first successful attempt to address a long-standing problem in\\nthe field of time-lapse microscopy in the root meristem by proposing an\\naccurate tracking method for Arabidopsis root nuclei.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T06:07:17Z\"}"}
