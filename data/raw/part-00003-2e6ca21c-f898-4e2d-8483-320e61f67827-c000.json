Results for He-like\\n  atoms\", \"summary\": \"The Hartree-Fock-Rothaan equations are solved for He-like ions using the\\niterative self-consistent method. Bagci-Hoggan complete and orthonormal sets of\\nexponential-type orbitals are employed as the basis. These orbitals satisfy the\\northonormality relationship for quantum numbers with fractional order. They are\\nsolution of Schrodinger-like differential equation derived by the author. In a\\nrecent study conducted for the calculation of the hydrogen atom energy levels,\\nit has been demonstrated that the fractional formalism of the principal and the\\nangular momentum quantum numbers converges to the 1s level of the ground state\\nenergy of hydrogen atom, obtained from the solution of the standard Schrodinger\\nequation. This study examines the effect of fractional values of the quantum\\nnumbers for two-electron systems, where electron correlation effects exist.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T10:42:04Z\"}"}
