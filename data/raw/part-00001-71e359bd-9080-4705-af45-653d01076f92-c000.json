Numexo2 has been gradually extended and improved as a general purpose\\ndigitizer to fulfill various needs in nuclear physics detection at GANIL. This\\nwas possible thanks to reprogrammable components like FPGAs and the\\noptimization of different algorithms. The originality of this work compared to\\nsimilar systems is that all numerical operations follow the digital data flow\\nfrom ADCs, without any storage step of samples. Some details are given on\\ndigital processing of the signals, delivered by a large variety of detectors:\\nHPGe, silicon strip detector, ionisation chamber, liquid and plastic\\nscintillators read-out with photomultipliers, Multi Wire Proportional Counter\\nand drift chamber.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det,nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:35:46Z\"}"}
