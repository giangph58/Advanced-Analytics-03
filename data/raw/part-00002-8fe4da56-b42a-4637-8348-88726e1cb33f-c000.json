After reviewing existing conditions and\\nhighlighting some gaps in the literature, we introduce a new class of network\\nsystems, named Christmas trees, which generalizes trees and cacti. We then\\nestablish a graph-theoretic characterization of sets of nodes that are\\nstructurally target controllable for a simple subclass of Christmas trees. Our\\ncharacterization applies to general network systems by considering spanning\\nsubgraphs of Christmas tree class and allows us to uncover target controllable\\nsets that existing criteria fail to identify.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T09:54:04Z\"}"}
