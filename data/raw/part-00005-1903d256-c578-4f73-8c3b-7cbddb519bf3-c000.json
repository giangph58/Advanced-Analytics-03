{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03649v1\", \"title\": \"Weighted Random Dot Product Graphs\", \"summary\": \"Modeling of intricate relational patterns % through the analysis structures\\nof network data has become a cornerstone of contemporary statistical research\\nand related data science fields. Networks, represented as graphs, offer a\\nnatural framework for this analysis. This paper extends the Random Dot Product\\nGraph (RDPG) model to accommodate weighted graphs, markedly broadening the\\nmodel's scope to scenarios where edges exhibit heterogeneous weight\\ndistributions. We propose a nonparametric weighted (W)RDPG model that assigns a\\nsequence of latent positions to each node. Inner products of these nodal\\nvectors specify the moments of their incident edge weights' distribution via\\nmoment-generating functions. In this way, and unlike prior art, the WRDPG can\\ndiscriminate between weight distributions that share the same mean but differ\\nin other higher-order moments. We derive statistical guarantees for an\\nestimator of the nodal's latent positions adapted from the workhorse adjacency\\nspectral embedding, establishing its consistency and asymptotic normality. We\\nalso contribute a generative framework that enables sampling of graphs that\\nadhere to a (prescribed or data-fitted) WRDPG, facilitating, e.g., the analysis\\nand testing of observed graph metrics using judicious reference distributions.\\nThe paper is organized to formalize the model's definition, the estimation (or\\nnodal embedding) process and its guarantees, as well as the methodologies for\\ngenerating weighted graphs, all complemented by illustrative and reproducible\\nexamples showcasing the WRDPG's effectiveness in various network analytic\\napplications.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ML\", \"categories\": \"stat.ML,cs.LG,math.CO,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:57:00Z\"}"}
