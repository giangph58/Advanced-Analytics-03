{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15764v1\", \"title\": \"From Spin Waves to Monte Carlo Simulations: Compiling an Experimental\\n  Exchange Interaction Dataset for Magnetic Materials\", \"summary\": \"Inelastic neutron scattering data on magnetic crystals are highly valuable in\\nmaterials science, as they provide direct insight into microscopic magnetic\\ninteractions. Using spin wave theory, these interactions can be extracted from\\nmagnetic excitations observed in such experiments. However, these datasets are\\noften scattered across the literature and lack standardization, limiting their\\naccessibility and usability. In this paper, we compile and standardize\\nHeisenberg exchange interaction data for magnetic materials obtained from\\ninelastic neutron scattering experiments. Through an extensive literature\\nreview, we identify experimental data for approximately 100 magnetic materials.\\nThe standardized dataset includes mapping the results of various Heisenberg\\nHamiltonians into a unified standard form, visualizations of crystal structures\\nwith annotated exchange interactions, and input and output files from Monte\\nCarlo simulations performed for each compound using the ESpinS code. Using\\nexperimentally determined exchange interactions, we calculate transition\\ntemperatures $T_c$ via classical Monte Carlo simulations. Additionally, we\\nassess the effectiveness of the $S+1)/S$ correction within classical Monte\\nCarlo simulations, finding that it produces transition temperatures in\\nexcellent agreement with experimental values in most cases. The complete\\ndataset, along with supporting resources, is publicly available on GitHub.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T10:17:32Z\"}"}
