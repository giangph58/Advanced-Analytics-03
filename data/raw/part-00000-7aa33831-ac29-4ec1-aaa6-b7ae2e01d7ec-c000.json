{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17739v1\", \"title\": \"Interpretable Early Detection of Parkinson's Disease through Speech\\n  Analysis\", \"summary\": \"Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting\\nmotor and non-motor functions, with speech impairments among its earliest\\nsymptoms. Speech impairments offer a valuable diagnostic opportunity, with\\nmachine learning advances providing promising tools for timely detection. In\\nthis research, we propose a deep learning approach for early Parkinson's\\ndisease detection from speech recordings, which also highlights the vocal\\nsegments driving predictions to enhance interpretability. This approach seeks\\nto associate predictive speech patterns with articulatory features, providing a\\nbasis for interpreting underlying neuromuscular impairments. We evaluated our\\napproach using the Italian Parkinson's Voice and Speech Database, containing\\n831 audio recordings from 65 participants, including both healthy individuals\\nand patients. Our approach showed competitive classification performance\\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods, while providing enhanced interpretability\\nby identifying key speech features influencing predictions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T16:50:52Z\"}"}
