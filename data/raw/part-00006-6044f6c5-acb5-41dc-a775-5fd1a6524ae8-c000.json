Although neutral-atom quantum\\ncomputers have demonstrated native multi-qubit gates, existing approaches that\\navoid additional control or multiple atomic species have been limited to\\nsingle-target gates. We propose single-control-multi-target CZ^{\\\\otimes N})\\ngates on a single-species neutral-atom platform that require no extra control\\nand have gate durations comparable to standard CZ gates. Our approach leverages\\ntailored interatomic distances to create an asymmetric blockade between the\\ncontrol and target atoms. Using a GPU-accelerated pulse synthesis protocol, we\\ndesign smooth control pulses for CZZ and CZZZ gates, achieving fidelities of up\\nto 99.55% and 99.24%, respectively, even in the presence of simulated atom\\nplacement errors and Rydberg-state decay. This work presents a practical path\\nto implementing multi-target gates in neutral-atom systems, significantly\\nreducing the resource overhead for syndrome extraction.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T17:59:56Z\"}"}
