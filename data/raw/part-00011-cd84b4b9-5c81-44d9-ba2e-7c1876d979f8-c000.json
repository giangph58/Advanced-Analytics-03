However, the presence of dynamic objects may introduce\\nartifacts into the map, which can significantly degrade the performance of\\nlocalization and path planning. To tackle this problem, a novel online dynamic\\nobject removal framework for static map construction based on conservative free\\nspace estimation (FreeDOM) is proposed, consisting of a scan-removal front-end\\nand a map-refinement back-end. First, we propose a multi-resolution map\\nstructure for fast computation and effective map representation. In the\\nscan-removal front-end, we employ raycast enhancement to improve free space\\nestimation and segment the LiDAR scan based on the estimated free space. In the\\nmap-refinement back-end, we further eliminate residual dynamic objects in the\\nmap by leveraging incremental free space information. As experimentally\\nverified on SemanticKITTI, HeLiMOS, and indoor datasets with various sensors,\\nour proposed framework overcomes the limitations of visibility-based methods\\nand outperforms state-of-the-art methods with an average F1-score improvement\\nof 9.7%.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T11:16:09Z\"}"}
