Starting from a\\ncase study set out in the literature, and taking the Baranyi model as the\\nprimary model, and the Ratkowsky square-root model as the secondary, D- and\\nc-optimal designs are provided for isothermal experiments, taking the\\ntemperature both as a value fixed by the experimenter and as a variable to be\\ndesigned. The designs calculated show that those commonly used in practice are\\nnot efficient enough to estimate the parameters of the secondary model, leading\\nto greater uncertainty in the predictions made via these models. Finally, an\\nanalysis is carried out to determine the effect on the efficiency of the\\npossible reduction in the final experimental time.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T07:46:11Z\"}"}
