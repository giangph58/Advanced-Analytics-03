We observe excellent agreement between\\nall perturbative and numerical results which uniformly support the hypothesis\\nthat this family of black-hole mimickers is separated into stable and unstable\\nbranches by extremal-mass configurations. This separation includes, in\\nparticular, thin-shell boson stars with light rings located on the stable\\nbranch which we conclude to represent long-term stable black-hole mimickers.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T17:48:48Z\"}"}
