The approach builds on the nonparametric identification\\nstrategy of Gandhi et al. (2020) and exploits the zero-profit condition to\\nallow consistent estimation even when either capital input or housing value is\\nunobserved, under the assumption that land productivity follows a Markov\\nprocess. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the estimator performs well\\nacross a variety of production technologies.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T04:51:35Z\"}"}
