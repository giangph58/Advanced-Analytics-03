{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10211v1\", \"title\": \"Energy-preserving iteration schemes for Gauss collocation integrators\", \"summary\": \"In this work, we develop energy-preserving iterative schemes for the\\n(non-)linear systems arising in the Gauss integration of Poisson systems with\\nquadratic Hamiltonian. Exploiting the relation between Gauss collocation\\nintegrators and diagonal Pad\\\\'e approximations, we establish a Krylov-subspace\\niteration scheme based on a $Q$-Arnoldi process for linear systems that\\nprovides energy conservation not only at convergence --as standard iteration\\nschemes do--, but also at the level of the individual iterates. It is\\ncompetitive with GMRES in terms of accuracy and cost for a single iteration\\nstep and hence offers significant efficiency gains, when it comes to time\\nintegration of high-dimensional Poisson systems within given error tolerances.\\nOn top of the linear results, we consider non-linear Poisson systems and design\\nnon-linear solvers for the implicit midpoint rule (Gauss integrator of second\\norder), using the fact that the associated Pad\\\\'e approximation is a Cayley\\ntransformation. For the non-linear systems arising at each time step, we\\npropose fixed-point and Newton-type iteration schemes that inherit the\\nconvergence order with comparable cost from their classical versions, but have\\nenergy-preserving iterates.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T13:26:38Z\"}"}
