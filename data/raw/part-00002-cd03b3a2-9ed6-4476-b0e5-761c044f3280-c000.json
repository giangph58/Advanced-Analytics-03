In general, CLIPSE uses CLIP embeddings\\nto process the images and also the text queries. The overall framework is\\ndesigned with simplicity to enable easy extension and usage. Two benchmark\\nscenarios are described and evaluated, covering indexing and querying time. It\\nis shown that CLIPSE is capable of handling smaller datasets; for larger\\ndatasets, a distributed approach with several instances should be considered.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T15:13:37Z\"}"}
