The results cover the pseudorapidity range $\\\\left|\\\\eta\\\\right|\\n< 1.1$ and constitute the first such measurement performed using a hadronic\\ncalorimeter at RHIC. Measurements of $dE_{T}/d\\\\eta$ are presented for a range\\nof centrality intervals and the average $dE_{T}/d\\\\eta$ as a function of the\\nnumber of participating nucleons, $N_{\\\\mathrm{part}}$, is compared to a variety\\nof Monte Carlo heavy-ion event generators. The results are in agreement with\\nprevious measurements at RHIC, and feature an improved granularity in $\\\\eta$\\nand improved precision in low-$N_{\\\\mathrm{part}}$ events.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-ex\", \"categories\": \"nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T03:14:37Z\"}"}
