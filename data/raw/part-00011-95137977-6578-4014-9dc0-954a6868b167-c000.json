{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03212v1\", \"title\": \"Elastic Index Select for Label-Hybrid Search in Vector Database\", \"summary\": \"Real-world vector embeddings are usually associated with extra labels, such\\nas attributes and keywords. Many applications require the nearest neighbor\\nsearch that contains specific labels, such as searching for product image\\nembeddings restricted to a particular brand. A straightforward approach is to\\nmaterialize all possible indices according to the complete query label\\nworkload. However, this leads to an exponential increase in both index space\\nand processing time, which significantly limits scalability and efficiency. In\\nthis paper, we leverage the inclusion relationships among query label sets to\\nconstruct partial indexes, enabling index sharing across queries for improved\\nconstruction efficiency. We introduce \\\\textit{elastic factor} bounds to\\nguarantee search performance and use the greedy algorithm to select indices\\nthat meet the bounds, achieving a tradeoff between efficiency and space.\\nMeanwhile, we also designed the algorithm to achieve the best elastic factor\\nunder a given space limitation. Experimental results on multiple real datasets\\ndemonstrate that our algorithm can achieve near-optimal search performance,\\nachieving up to 10x-500x search efficiency speed up over state-of-the-art\\napproaches. Our algorithm is highly versatile, since it is not constrained by\\nindex type and can seamlessly integrate with existing optimized libraries.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DB\", \"categories\": \"cs.DB\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T05:59:23Z\"}"}
