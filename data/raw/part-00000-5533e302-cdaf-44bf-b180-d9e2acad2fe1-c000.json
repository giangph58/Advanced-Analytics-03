{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21681v1\", \"title\": \"A Comprehensive Benchmark for RNA 3D Structure-Function Modeling\", \"summary\": \"The RNA structure-function relationship has recently garnered significant\\nattention within the deep learning community, promising to grow in importance\\nas nucleic acid structure models advance. However, the absence of standardized\\nand accessible benchmarks for deep learning on RNA 3D structures has impeded\\nthe development of models for RNA functional characteristics.\\n  In this work, we introduce a set of seven benchmarking datasets for RNA\\nstructure-function prediction, designed to address this gap. Our library builds\\non the established Python library rnaglib, and offers easy data distribution\\nand encoding, splitters and evaluation methods, providing a convenient\\nall-in-one framework for comparing models. Datasets are implemented in a fully\\nmodular and reproducible manner, facilitating for community contributions and\\ncustomization. Finally, we provide initial baseline results for all tasks using\\na graph neural network.\\n  Source code: https://github.com/cgoliver/rnaglib\\n  Documentation: https://rnaglib.org\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.BM\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.BM,cs.LG,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T16:49:31Z\"}"}
