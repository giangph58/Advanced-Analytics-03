{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12744v1\", \"title\": \"Biasing the Driving Style of an Artificial Race Driver for Online\\n  Time-Optimal Maneuver Planning\", \"summary\": \"In this work, we present a novel approach to bias the driving style of an\\nartificial race driver (ARD) for online time-optimal trajectory planning. Our\\nmethod leverages a nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) framework that\\ncombines time minimization with exit speed maximization at the end of the\\nplanning horizon. We introduce a new MPC terminal cost formulation based on the\\ntrajectory planned in the previous MPC step, enabling ARD to adapt its driving\\nstyle from early to late apex maneuvers in real-time. Our approach is\\ncomputationally efficient, allowing for low replan times and long planning\\nhorizons. We validate our method through simulations, comparing the results\\nagainst offline minimum-lap-time (MLT) optimal control and online minimum-time\\nMPC solutions. The results demonstrate that our new terminal cost enables ARD\\nto bias its driving style, and achieve online lap times close to the MLT\\nsolution and faster than the minimum-time MPC solution. Our approach paves the\\nway for a better understanding of the reasons behind human drivers' choice of\\nearly or late apex maneuvers.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T08:35:28Z\"}"}
