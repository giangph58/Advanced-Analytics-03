{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10868v1\", \"title\": \"AdS3 axion wormholes as stable contributions to the Euclidean\\n  gravitational path integral\", \"summary\": \"Recent work has demonstrated that Euclidean Giddings-Strominger axion\\nwormholes are stable in asymptotically flat 4D Minkowski spacetime, suggesting\\nthat they should, at least naively, be included as contributions in the quantum\\ngravitational path integral. Such inclusion appears to lead to known wormhole\\nparadoxes, such as the factorization problem. In this paper, we generalize\\nthese results to AdS3 spacetime, where the axion is equivalent to a U(1) gauge\\nfield. We explicitly construct the classical wormhole solutions, show their\\nregularity and stability, and compute their actions for arbitrary ratios of the\\nwormhole mouth radius to the AdS radius and across various topologies. Finally,\\nWe discuss potential implications of these findings for the 3D gravitational\\npath integral.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T05:00:20Z\"}"}
