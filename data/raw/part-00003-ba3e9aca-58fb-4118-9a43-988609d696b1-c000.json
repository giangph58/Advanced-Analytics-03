However, deployment\\nremains a critical challenge due to complex environment configurations,\\ndependency conflicts, cross-platform adaptation, and debugging difficulties,\\nwhich hinder automation and adoption. This paper introduces AI2Agent, an\\nend-to-end framework that automates AI project deployment through\\nguideline-driven execution, self-adaptive debugging, and case \\\\& solution\\naccumulation. AI2Agent dynamically analyzes deployment challenges, learns from\\npast cases, and iteratively refines its approach, significantly reducing human\\nintervention. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conducted experiments on 30 AI\\ndeployment cases, covering TTS, text-to-image generation, image editing, and\\nother AI applications. Results show that AI2Agent significantly reduces\\ndeployment time and improves success rates. The code and demo video are now\\npublicly accessible.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T10:58:34Z\"}"}
