We introduce\\nFairEval, a novel evaluation framework to systematically assess fairness in\\nLLM-based recommendations. FairEval integrates personality traits with eight\\nsensitive demographic attributes,including gender, race, and age, enabling a\\ncomprehensive assessment of user-level bias. We evaluate models, including\\nChatGPT 4o and Gemini 1.5 Flash, on music and movie recommendations. FairEval's\\nfairness metric, PAFS, achieves scores up to 0.9969 for ChatGPT 4o and 0.9997\\nfor Gemini 1.5 Flash, with disparities reaching 34.79 percent. These results\\nhighlight the importance of robustness in prompt sensitivity and support more\\ninclusive recommendation systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR,cs.AI,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:38:15Z\"}"}
