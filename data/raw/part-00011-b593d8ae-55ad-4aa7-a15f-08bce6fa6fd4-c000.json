Meanwhile, advances in\\nconnected vehicle (CV) technology have sparked extensive research into CV-based\\ntraffic signal control. Despite these developments, few studies have\\ninvestigated MP control in heterogeneously distributed and partially CV\\nenvironments while ensuring network queue stability. To address these research\\ngaps, we propose a CV-based MP control (CV-MP) method that leverages real-time\\nCV travel time information to compute the pressure, thereby incorporating both\\nthe spatial distribution and temporal delays of vehicles, unlike existing\\napproaches that utilized only spatial distribution or temporal delays. In\\nparticular, we establish sufficient conditions for road network queue stability\\nthat are compatible with most existing MP control methods. Moreover, we\\npioneered the proof of network queue stability even if the vehicles are only\\npartially connected and heterogeneously distributed, and gave a necessary\\ncondition of CV observation for maintaining the stability. Evaluation results\\non an Amsterdam corridor show that CV-MP significantly reduces vehicle delays\\ncompared to both actuated control and conventional MP control across various CV\\npenetration rates. Moreover, in scenarios with dynamic traffic demand, CV-MP\\nachieves lower spillover peaks even with low and heterogeneous CV penetration\\nrates, further highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:04:52Z\"}"}
