We\\ndevelop a model to study the charging process of a quantum battery in an open\\nquantum setting, where the battery interacts with a charger and a structured\\nreservoir. To overcome the limitations of static charging protocols, a\\nreinforcement learning (RL) charging strategy is proposed, which utilizes the\\ndeep deterministic policy gradient algorithm alongside long short-term memory\\n(LSTM) networks. The LSTM networks enable the RL model to capture temporal\\ncorrelations driven by non-Markovian dynamics, facilitating a continuous,\\nadaptive charging strategy. The RL protocols consistently outperform\\nconventional fixed heuristic strategies by real-time controlling the driving\\nfield amplitude and coupling parameters. By penalizing battery-to-charger\\nbackflow in the reward function, the RL-optimized charging strategy promotes\\nefficient unidirectional energy transfer from charger to battery, achieving\\nhigher and more stable extractable work. The proposed RL controller would\\nprovide a framework for designing efficient charging schemes in broader\\nconfigurations and multi-cell quantum batteries.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T14:40:11Z\"}"}
