In this article, we provide two major advancements: First, we give a\\ndecomposition for FRC, enabling local computations of FRC. Second, we construct\\na set-theoretical proof enabling an efficient algorithm for the local\\ncomputation of FRC in Vietoris-Rips (VR) complexes.Strikingly, this approach\\nreveals critical information and geometric insights often overlooked by\\nconventional classification techniques. Our findings open new avenues for\\ngeometric computations in VR complexes and highlight an essential yet\\nunder-explored aspect of data classification: the geometry underpinning\\nstatistical patterns.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GT\", \"categories\": \"math.GT,cs.CG,cs.DM,cs.DS,math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T12:59:23Z\"}"}
