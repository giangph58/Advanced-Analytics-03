By\\nestablishing a connection between strongly quasiconvex functions and the theory\\nof mutually polar mappings on convex cones, we integrate this generalized\\nprojection concept into the duality framework of Riesz spaces, vector norms,\\nand Euclidean metric projections. A central result of this study is the\\nidentification of conditions under which the null space of a projection onto a\\nclosed convex cone forms a closed convex cone. We provide a comprehensive\\ncharacterization of such cones and projections, highlighting their fundamental\\nrole in extending the duality theory to generalized projection operators.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:53:14Z\"}"}
