{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17278v1\", \"title\": \"An Upper Bound on Generalized Cospectral Mates of Oriented Graphs Using\\n  Skew-Walk Matrices\", \"summary\": \"Let $D$ be an oriented graph with skew adjacency matrix $S(D)$. Two oriented\\ngraphs $D$ and $C$ are said to share the same generalized skew spectrum if\\n$S(D)$ and $S(C)$ have the same eigenvalues, and $J-S(D)$ and $J-S(C)$ also\\nhave the same eigenvalues, where $J$ is the all-ones matrix. Such graphs that\\nare not isomorphic are generalized cospectral mates. We derive tight upper\\nbounds on the number of non-isomorphic generalized cospectral mates an oriented\\ngraph can admit, based on arithmetic criteria involving the determinant of its\\nskew-walk matrix. As a special case, we also provide a criterion for an\\noriented graph to be weakly determined by its generalized skew spectrum\\n(WDGSS), that is, its only generalized cospectral mate is its transpose. These\\ncriteria relate directly to the controllability of graphs, a fundamental\\nconcept in the control of networked systems, thereby connecting spectral\\ncharacterization of graphs to graph controllability.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,math.AC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T06:08:03Z\"}"}
