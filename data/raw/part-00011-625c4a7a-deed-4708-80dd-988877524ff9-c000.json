{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19639v1\", \"title\": \"A Unified Benchmark of Federated Learning with Kolmogorov-Arnold\\n  Networks for Medical Imaging\", \"summary\": \"Federated Learning (FL) enables model training across decentralized devices\\nwithout sharing raw data, thereby preserving privacy in sensitive domains like\\nhealthcare. In this paper, we evaluate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)\\narchitectures against traditional MLP across six state-of-the-art FL algorithms\\non a blood cell classification dataset. Notably, our experiments demonstrate\\nthat KAN can effectively replace MLP in federated environments, achieving\\nsuperior performance with simpler architectures. Furthermore, we analyze the\\nimpact of key hyperparameters-grid size and network architecture-on KAN\\nperformance under varying degrees of Non-IID data distribution. Additionally,\\nour ablation studies reveal that optimizing KAN width while maintaining minimal\\ndepth yields the best performance in federated settings. As a result, these\\nfindings establish KAN as a promising alternative for privacy-preserving\\nmedical imaging applications in distributed healthcare. To the best of our\\nknowledge, this is the first comprehensive benchmark of KAN in FL settings for\\nmedical imaging task.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T09:53:05Z\"}"}
