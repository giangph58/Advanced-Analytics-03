In this work, we compare scores from SEE with the\\ntraditional measure calculated from the E-CLASS, which probes student views\\nabout experimental physics, to show that the SEE score is a quantitatively\\ndifferent measure. Consequently, we show that student self-recognition\\ndecreases from pre-instruction administration of the E-CLASS to the\\npost-instruction administration when averaged across data from 494 courses\\nhaving taken place between 2016--2019.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ed-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ed-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:59:27Z\"}"}
