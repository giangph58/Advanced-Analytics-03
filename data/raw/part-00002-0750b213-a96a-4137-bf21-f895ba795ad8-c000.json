By relaxing a Selmer structure of\\nrank zero at certain prime, we can construct an auxiliary Kolyvagin system\\nwhose localisation determines most of the Fitting ideals of the Selmer group,\\nand all of them when the Galois representation is not self-dual. With this new\\ntheory, one can describe, in terms of the modular symbols, the Galois structure\\nof the Selmer group of an elliptic curve $E/\\\\mathbb{Q}$ over a finite abelian\\nextension whose degree is coprime to $p$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:37:36Z\"}"}
