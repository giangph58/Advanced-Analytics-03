In this\\npaper, we investigate the PRGs against the functions of degree-$d$ polynomial\\nthreshold functions (PTFs) over Gaussian space. Our main result is an explicit\\nconstruction of PRG with seed length $\\\\mathrm{poly}(k,d,1/\\\\epsilon)\\\\cdot\\\\log n$\\nthat can fool any function of $k$ degree-$d$ PTFs with probability at least\\n$1-\\\\varepsilon$. More specifically, we show that the summation of $L$\\nindependent $R$-moment-matching Gaussian vectors $\\\\epsilon$-fools functions of\\n$k$ degree-$d$ PTFs, where $L=\\\\mathrm{poly}( k, d, \\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon})$ and $R\\n= O({\\\\log \\\\frac{kd}{\\\\epsilon}})$. The PRG is then obtained by applying an\\nappropriate discretization to Gaussian vectors with bounded independence.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CC\", \"categories\": \"cs.CC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T06:28:56Z\"}"}
