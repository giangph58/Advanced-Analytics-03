The system consists of a massive dwarf ($M_{\\\\rm halo}\\n\\\\sim 10^{11.5} M_{\\\\odot}$) and a lower-mass companion ($M_{\\\\rm halo} \\\\sim\\n10^{10} M_{\\\\odot}$), dynamically evolving in isolation before infall into a\\nMilky Way-mass halo. The massive dwarf hosts a warm coronal gas envelope with a\\ntemperature of $T \\\\sim 3 \\\\times 10^5$ K, consistent with expectations for\\nvirialized CGM in dwarf halos. Tidal interactions produce a neutral gas stream\\nthat extends over $\\\\sim 150$ kpc, with an \\\\ion{H}{1} mass of $M_{\\\\rm HI} \\\\sim\\n10^8 M_{\\\\odot}$, similar to the Magellanic Stream. Furthermore, in the\\n\\\\textsc{Hestia} simulation suite, we find that coronal gas is ubiquitous in all\\nhalos with $M_{\\\\rm halo} > 10^{11} M_{\\\\odot}$, implying that massive dwarfs\\ngenerically develop extended gaseous envelopes prior to accretion. This result\\nhas significant implications for the survival of neutral tidal structures, and\\nsuggests that current and future high-ion UV absorption-line observations are\\nindicative of warm coronae surrounding LMC-mass dwarfs, independent of their\\nenvironment.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T17:13:24Z\"}"}
