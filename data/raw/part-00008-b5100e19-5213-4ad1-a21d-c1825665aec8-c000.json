{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04232v1\", \"title\": \"Binary Reconstruction Codes for Correcting One Deletion and One\\n  Substitution\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we investigate binary reconstruction codes capable of\\ncorrecting one deletion and one substitution. We define the\\n\\\\emph{single-deletion single-substitution ball} function $ \\\\mathcal{B} $ as a\\nmapping from a sequence to the set of sequences that can be derived from it by\\nperforming one deletion and one substitution. A binary\\n\\\\emph{$(n,N;\\\\mathcal{B})$-reconstruction code} is defined as a collection of\\nbinary sequences of length $ n $ such that the intersection size between the\\nsingle-deletion single-substitution balls of any two distinct codewords is\\nstrictly less than $ N $. This property ensures that each codeword can be\\nuniquely reconstructed from $ N $ distinct elements in its single-deletion\\nsingle-substitution ball. Our main contribution is to demonstrate that when $ N\\n$ is set to $ 4n - 8 $, $ 3n - 4 $, $2n+9$, $ n+21 $, $31$, and $7$, the\\nredundancy of binary $(n,N;\\\\mathcal{B})$-reconstruction codes can be $0$, $1$,\\n$2$, $ \\\\log\\\\log n + 3 $, $\\\\log n + 1 $, and $ 3\\\\log n + 4 $, respectively,\\nwhere the logarithm is on base two.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T08:34:06Z\"}"}
