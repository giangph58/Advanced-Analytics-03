Nowadays, vehicular communication has become\\none of the challenging applications of wireless networks. In this article, we\\naim to address the radio resource management in Cellular V2X (C-V2X) networks\\nusing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA).\\nThe goal of this problem is to maximize the spectral efficiency of vehicular\\nusers in Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) networks under a fronthaul\\nconstraint. To solve this problem, a two-stage approach is utilized. In the\\nfirst stage, vehicles in dense area are clustered based on their geographical\\nlocations, predicted location of vehicles, and speeds. Then UAVs are deployed\\nto serve the clusters. In the second stage, NOMA groups are formed within each\\ncluster and radio resources are allocated to vehicles based on NOMA groups. An\\noptimization problem is formulated and a suboptimal method is used to solve it.\\nThe performance of the proposed method is evaluated through simulations where\\nresults demonstrate superiority of proposed method in spectral efficiency, min\\npoint, and distance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:00:20Z\"}"}
