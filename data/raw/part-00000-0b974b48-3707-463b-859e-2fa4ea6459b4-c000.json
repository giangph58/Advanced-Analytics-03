{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15102v1\", \"title\": \"Atmospheric muon flux suppression at potential new low-radiation\\n  underground physics laboratory in Israel\", \"summary\": \"The residual atmospheric muon flux was measured at a candidate site for a new\\nunderground, low-radiation physics laboratory beneath the Kokhav HaYarden\\nnational park in Israel. Located inside the tunnels of a hydroelectric\\npumped-storage facility operating since 2024, the proposed site benefits from a\\nvertical rock overburden of 361 meters, large potential floorspace, and easy\\naccess by road. A muon hodoscope of vertically stacked wide-area $144 \\\\times 60\\n\\\\times 1.2 $ cm$^3$ plastic scintillator plates was employed to measure the\\nsuppression in the integrated muon flux at the site as compared with above\\nground at sea level. Data-taking took place in mid-August of 2024 for several\\ndays and was split into South-North and West-East orientations to account for\\nthe directional acceptances due to the geometry of the detector. The\\nsuppression factor is reported at $4456 \\\\pm 77$, expressed as $3.75 \\\\pm 0.06\\n\\\\times 10^{-6}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in absolute terms, corresponding to an\\neffective overburden of roughly $873$ m.w.e.. A deeper location at the site may\\nalso be available, but it could not be reached at this time. Furthermore, the\\nasymmetric topography of the mountain above and its muon shadow are clearly\\nvisible in the angular data. Finally, auxiliary environmental measurements\\nrecorded low background radon activity at $28.3 \\\\pm 14.0$ Bq m$^{-3}$. The\\nexperimental campaign thus succeeded in demonstrating the viability of the\\nsite's working conditions for future scientific research.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T13:51:10Z\"}"}
