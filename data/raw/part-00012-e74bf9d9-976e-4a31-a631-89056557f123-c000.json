The tool incorporates semantic emotional tags for sentiment\\nclassification. I evaluate the tool using standard methods, which are F-score,\\nrecall, and precision. The method is to show the impact of Arabic online\\nmetaphors on sentiment through the newly designed tools. To the best of our\\nknowledge, this is the first approach to conduct sentiment classification for\\nArabic metaphors using semantic tags to find the impact of the metaphor.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T08:53:28Z\"}"}
