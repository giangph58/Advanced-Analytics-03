We argue that the current RDBMSs\\ndon't inherently support sufficient \\\"logical\\\" data independence, and that is\\nrelegating the database systems to the role of a backend storage system, away\\nfrom where significant innovation is both happening and is still needed. We\\npresent the design of a prototype system (ErbiumDB) that we are building to\\nexplore these issues, and discuss some of the key research challenges.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DB\", \"categories\": \"cs.DB\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T13:44:28Z\"}"}
