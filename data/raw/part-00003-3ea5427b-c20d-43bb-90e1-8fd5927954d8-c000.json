However, these indexes face scalability challenges\\nbecause of the exponential number of possible n-grams that must be indexed.\\nMany existing selection strategies, developed decades ago, have not been\\nrigorously evaluated on contemporary large-scale workloads and lack\\ncomprehensive performance comparisons. Therefore, a unified and comprehensive\\nevaluation framework is necessary to compare these methods under the same\\nexperimental settings. This paper presents the first systematic evaluation of\\nthree representative n-gram selection strategies across five workloads,\\nincluding real-time production logs and genomic sequence analysis. We examine\\ntheir trade-offs in terms of index construction time, storage overhead, false\\npositive rates, and end-to-end query performance. Through empirical results,\\nthis study provides a modern perspective on existing n-gram based regular\\nexpression evaluation methods, extensive observations, valuable discoveries,\\nand an adaptable testing framework to guide future research in this domain. We\\nmake our implementations of these methods and our test framework available as\\nopen-source at https://github.com/mush-zhang/RegexIndexComparison.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DB\", \"categories\": \"cs.DB\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T16:58:26Z\"}"}
