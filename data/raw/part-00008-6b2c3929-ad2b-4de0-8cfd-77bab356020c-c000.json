The algorithm features a self-adaptive strategy that\\neliminates the need for prior knowledge of the Lipschitz constant and\\nincorporate a conjugate gradient-type direction to enhance convergence speed.\\nWe establish a result describing the behavior generated therefrom toward the\\nsolution set. Using this result, we prove the strong convergence of the\\nproposed method and provide numerical experiments to demonstrate its\\ncomputational efficacy and robustness.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:14:55Z\"}"}
