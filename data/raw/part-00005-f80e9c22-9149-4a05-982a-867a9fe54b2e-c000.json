{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12921v1\", \"title\": \"IdentiARAT: Toward Automated Identification of Individual ARAT Items\\n  from Wearable Sensors\", \"summary\": \"This study explores the potential of using wrist-worn inertial sensors to\\nautomate the labeling of ARAT (Action Research Arm Test) items. While the ARAT\\nis commonly used to assess upper limb motor function, its limitations include\\nsubjectivity and time consumption of clinical staff. By using IMU (Inertial\\nMeasurement Unit) sensors and MiniROCKET as a time series classification\\ntechnique, this investigation aims to classify ARAT items based on sensor\\nrecordings. We test common preprocessing strategies to efficiently leverage\\nincluded information in the data. Afterward, we use the best preprocessing to\\nimprove the classification. The dataset includes recordings of 45 participants\\nperforming various ARAT items. Results show that MiniROCKET offers a fast and\\nreliable approach for classifying ARAT domains, although challenges remain in\\ndistinguishing between individual resembling items. Future work may involve\\nimproving classification through more advanced machine-learning models and data\\nenhancements.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T13:11:13Z\"}"}
