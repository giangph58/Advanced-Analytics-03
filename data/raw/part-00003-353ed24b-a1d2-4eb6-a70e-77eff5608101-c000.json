{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07419v1\", \"title\": \"Exploring Vulnerabilities and Concerns in Solana Smart Contracts\", \"summary\": \"The Solana blockchain was created by Anatoly Yakovenko of Solana Labs and was\\nintroduced in 2017, employing a novel transaction verification method. However,\\nat the same time, the innovation process introduced some new security issues.\\nThe frequent security incidents in smart contracts have not only caused\\nenormous economic losses, but also undermined the credit system based on the\\nblockchain. The security and reliability of smart contracts have become a new\\nfocus of research both domestically and abroad. This paper studies the current\\nstatus of security analysis of Solana by researching Solana smart contract\\nsecurity analysis tools. This paper systematically sorts out the\\nvulnerabilities existing in Solana smart contracts and gives examples of some\\nvulnerabilities, summarizes the principles of security analysis tools, and\\ncomprehensively summarizes and details the security analysis tools in Solana\\nsmart contracts. The data of Solana smart contract security analysis tools are\\ncollected and compared with Ethereum, and the differences are analyzed and some\\ntools are selected for practical testing.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T03:25:20Z\"}"}
