In this paper, we consider this problem in a more general setting --\\nfinite cyclic semigroups. Let $\\\\mathcal{S}$ be a finite cyclic semigroup. By\\n$\\\\textbf{e}$ we denote the unique idempotent of the semigroup $\\\\mathcal{S}$.\\nLet $T$ be a sequence over the semigroup $\\\\mathcal{S}$, and let $N(T;\\n\\\\textbf{e})$ be the number of distinct subsequences of $T$ with sum being the\\nidempotent $\\\\textbf{e}$. We obtain the lower bound for $N(T; \\\\textbf{e})$ in\\nterms of the length of $T$, and moreover, prove that $T$ contains subsequences\\nwith some smooth-structure in case that $N(T; \\\\textbf{e})$ is not large. Our\\nresult generalizes the theorem obtained by W. Gao [Discrete Math., 1994] on the\\nenumeration of zero-sum subsequences over finite cyclic groups to the setting\\nof semigroups.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T12:35:23Z\"}"}
