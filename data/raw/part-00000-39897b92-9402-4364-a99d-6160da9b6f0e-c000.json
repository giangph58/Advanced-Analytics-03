Feed-down from\\nhigher-lying resonances is also taken into account. The results are compared\\nwith available data. Special attention is payed to the collision energies of\\n$\\\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 3, 3.2, 3.5, 3.9, and 4.5 GeV, for which a thorough scan of\\nthe energy, rapidity, and centrality dependence of $P_\\\\Lambda$ is performed.\\nThe results for 3 GeV reasonably well reproduce the corresponding STAR data.\\nWhile the results at $\\\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 3.2, 3.5, 3.9, and 4.5 GeV can be\\nconsidered as predictions for results of measurements within the STAR\\nfixed-target (STAR-FXT) programthat are expected in the nearest future. It is\\npredicted that a broad maximum of $P_\\\\Lambda$ is reached at\\n$\\\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\\\approx$ 3--3.9 GeV, exact position of which depends on the\\ncentrality and width of the midrapidity range of observation. Impact of the\\nmeson-field, thermal-shear and spin-Hall-effect contributions to $P_\\\\Lambda$ is\\nalso studied.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,hep-ph,nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T15:51:45Z\"}"}
