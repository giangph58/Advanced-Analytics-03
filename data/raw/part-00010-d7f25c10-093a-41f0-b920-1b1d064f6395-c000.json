{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16744v1\", \"title\": \"Traffic-Oblivious Multi-Commodity Flow Network Design\", \"summary\": \"We consider the Minimum Multi-Commodity Flow Subgraph (MMCFS) problem: given\\na directed graph $G$ with edge capacities $\\\\mathit{cap}$ and a retention ratio\\n$\\\\alpha\\\\in(0,1)$, find an edge-wise minimum subgraph $G' \\\\subseteq G$ such that\\nfor all traffic matrices $T$ routable in $G$ using a multi-commodity flow,\\n$\\\\alpha\\\\cdot T$ is routable in $G'$. This natural yet novel problem is\\nmotivated by recent research that investigates how the power consumption in\\nbackbone computer networks can be reduced by turning off connections during\\ntimes of low demand without compromising the quality of service. Since the\\nactual traffic demands are generally not known beforehand, our approach must be\\ntraffic-oblivious, i.e., work for all possible sets of simultaneously routable\\ntraffic demands in the original network.\\n  In this paper we present the problem, relate it to other known problems in\\nliterature, and show several structural results, including a reformulation,\\nmaximum possible deviations from the optimum, and NP-hardness (as well as a\\ncertain inapproximability) already on very restricted instances. The most\\nsignificant contribution is a tight $\\\\max(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha}, 2)$-approximation\\nbased on an algorithmically surprisingly simple LP-rounding scheme.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T14:14:18Z\"}"}
