{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07795v1\", \"title\": \"Measurement of coincident photon-initiated processes in ultra-peripheral\\n  Pb+Pb collisions with the ATLAS detector\", \"summary\": \"The Lorentz-contracted electromagnetic fields of the ions in\\nultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions generate intense quasi-real photon\\nfluxes. These lead to photon-induced interactions that are observed in\\nultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs), such as vector meson and lepton-pair\\nproduction. The high photon flux also enables the occurrence of multiple\\nphoton-induced processes in a single collision. Presented is the first\\nmeasurement of the coincident production of $\\\\gamma\\\\gamma \\\\rightarrow\\n\\\\mu^{+}\\\\mu^{-}$ and $\\\\gamma+A\\\\rightarrow\\\\rho^{0}+A$ in UPC Pb+Pb collisions at\\ncentre-of-mass energies of 5.02 TeV and 5.36 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the\\nLarge Hadron Collider. The rate of the coincident process relative to the\\nexclusive $\\\\gamma\\\\gamma \\\\rightarrow \\\\mu^{+}\\\\mu^{-}$ process is measured\\ndifferentially in intervals of forward event activity, quantified by the Zero\\nDegree Calorimeters. The relative rate, summed over forward event activity, for\\nthe coincident $\\\\rho^{0}$ production is measured to be\\n$(9.3\\\\,\\\\pm0.4\\\\,\\\\mathrm{(stat.)}\\\\,\\\\pm0.2\\\\,\\\\mathrm{(syst.)})\\\\times10^{-3}$.\\nCorrelations between the dimuon kinematic properties, such as its mass, and the\\ncoincident $\\\\rho^{0}$ meson production rate, are also presented. These\\nmeasurements confirm the presence of multi photon-induced processes in UPC\\ncollisions, and can provide new insight into the impact parameter dependence of\\nphoton-induced vector meson production.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-ex\", \"categories\": \"nucl-ex,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:33:00Z\"}"}
