At\\nintermediate interactions of $U/t = 4,6$, we find quadratic dispersion around\\nthe gap minimum at wave-vectors $\\\\mathbf{k} = (\\\\pm \\\\pi/2, \\\\pm \\\\pi/2)$ (the\\n$\\\\Sigma$ points). We find saddle points at $\\\\mathbf{k} = (\\\\pm \\\\pi,0),(0,\\\\pm\\n\\\\pi)$ (the X points) where the dispersion is quartic, leading to a sharp DOS\\nmaximum above the almost flat ledge arising from the states close to $\\\\Sigma$.\\nThe fraction of quasi-particle states within the ledge is $n_{\\\\rm ledge}\\n\\\\approx 0.15$. Upon doping, within the rigid-band approximation, these results\\nsupport Fermi pockets around the $\\\\Sigma$ points, with states around the X\\npoints becoming filled only at doping fractions $x \\\\ge n_{\\\\rm ledge}$. The high\\ndensity of states and the associated onset of $(\\\\pi,\\\\pi)$ scattering may be an\\nimportant clue for a finite minimum doping level for superconductivity in the\\ncuprates.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:13:57Z\"}"}
