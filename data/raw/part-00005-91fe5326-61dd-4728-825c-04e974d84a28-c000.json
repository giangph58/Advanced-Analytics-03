In many such scenarios, identifying specific events is more critical\\nthan decoding full messages, motivating the use of deterministic identification\\n(DI). This paper investigates DI over discrete-time Poisson channels (DTPCs)\\nwith inter-symbol interference (ISI), a realistic setting due to channel memory\\neffects. We improve the known upper bound on DI capacity under power\\nconstraints from $\\\\frac{3}{2} + \\\\kappa$ to $\\\\frac{1 + \\\\kappa}{2}$.\\nAdditionally, we present the first results on deterministic identification with\\nfeedback (DIF) in this context, providing a constructive lower bound. These\\nfindings enhance the theoretical understanding of MC and support more\\nefficient, feedback-driven biomedical systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T08:53:27Z\"}"}
