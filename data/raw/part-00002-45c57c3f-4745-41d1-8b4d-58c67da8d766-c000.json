It is therefore crucial to develop models that\\ncan accurately clean the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in current and\\nfuture experiments. In this work, we present a new methodology based on neural\\nnetworks which operates on realistic temperature and polarization simulations.\\nWe assess its performance by comparing the power spectra of the output maps\\nwith those of the input maps and other emissions. For temperature, we obtain\\nresiduals of $20 \\\\pm \\\\mu K^{2}$. For polarization, we analyze the $E$ and $B$\\nmodes, which are related to density (scalar) and primordial gravitational waves\\n(tensorial) perturbations occurring in the first second of the Universe,\\nobtaining residuals of $10^{-2} \\\\mu K^{2}$ at $l>200$ and $10^{-2}$ and\\n$10^{-3} \\\\mu K^{2}$ for $E$ and $B$, respectively.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T08:44:46Z\"}"}
