Despite a few surveys addressing\\nrelated concepts such as Player Valuation, there is no comprehensive review\\ndedicated to an in-depth analysis of AV across different sports. In this\\nsurvey, we introduce a taxonomy with nine dimensions related to the AV task,\\nencompassing data, methodological approaches, evaluation techniques, and\\npractical applications. Through this analysis, we aim to identify the essential\\ncharacteristics of effective AV methods, highlight existing gaps in research,\\nand propose future directions for advancing the field.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T15:59:19Z\"}"}
