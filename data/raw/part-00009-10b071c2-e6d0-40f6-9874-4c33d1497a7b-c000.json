{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00542v1\", \"title\": \"Scalable Quantum Computing with Optical Links\", \"summary\": \"Quantum computers have great potential to solve problems which are\\nintractable on classical computers. However, quantum processors have not yet\\nreached the required scale to run applications which outperform traditional\\ncomputers. Leading hardware platforms, such as superconducting qubit based\\nprocessors, will soon become bottlenecked by the physical constraints of their\\nlow temperature environments, and the expansion of quantum computers will\\nnecessitate quantum links between multiple processor modules. Optical\\nfrequencies offer the most promising path for these links due to their\\nresilience to noise even at ambient temperature and the maturity of classical\\noptical networks. However, required microwave-to-optics transducers cannot\\noperate deterministically yet, which has widely been seen as a key challenge\\nfor their integration into fault-tolerant quantum computers. In this work, we\\nexamine implementations of optical links between cryogenic units that surpass\\nthe performance of individual cryogenic modules even with the performance of\\nexisting or near-term microwave-to-optics transducers. We show methods for\\nthese transducers to provide on-demand entanglement between separated quantum\\nprocessors with high fidelity and lay out key steps for adoption of the\\ntechnology including scaling transducer numbers and integration with other\\nhardware. Finally, we discuss a number of architectures comprised of these\\nlinks which can drive the expansion of quantum data centers to utility scale.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T14:09:32Z\"}"}
