{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21673v1\", \"title\": \"Effect of Magnetic Anisotropy and Gradient-Induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\\n  Interaction on the Formation of Magnetic Skyrmions\", \"summary\": \"Topological spin textures (e.g. skyrmions) can be stabilized by interfacial\\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in the magnetic multilayer, which has\\nbeen intensively studied. Recently, Bloch-type magnetic skyrmions stabilized by\\ncomposition gradient-induced DMI (g-DMI) have been observed in 10-nm thick CoPt\\nsingle layer. However, magnetic anisotropy in gradient-composition engineered\\nCoPt (g-CoPt) films is highly sensitive to both the relative Co/Pt composition\\nand the film thickness, leading to a complex interplay with g-DMI. The\\nstability of skyrmions under the combined influence of magnetic anisotropy and\\ng-DMI is crucial yet remains poorly understood. Here, we conduct a systematic\\nstudy on the characteristics of magnetic skyrmions as a function of gradient\\npolarity and effective gradient strength (defined as gradient/thickness) in\\ng-CoPt single layers (thickness of 10-30 nm) using magnetic force microscopy\\n(MFM), bulk magnetometry, and topological Hall effect measurements. Brillouin\\nlight scattering confirms that both the sign and magnitude of g-DMI depend on\\nthe polarity and amplitude of the composition gradient in g-CoPt films. MFM\\nreveals that skyrmion size and density vary with g-CoPt film thickness,\\ngradient polarity, and applied magnetic field. An increased skyrmion density is\\nobserved in samples exhibiting higher magnetic anisotropy, in agreement with\\nmicromagnetic simulations and energy barrier calculations.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:13:08Z\"}"}
