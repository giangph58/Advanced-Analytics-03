{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17602v1\", \"title\": \"Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves from self-resonant preheating in\\n  $\\u03b1$-attractor models\", \"summary\": \"After the inflationary phase, the universe enters the preheating phase,\\nduring which the inflaton field rolls down its potential and oscillates. When\\nthe potential significantly deviates from a parabolic shape at its minimum,\\nthese oscillations trigger an instability in the scalar perturbations, leading\\nto their amplification. This phenomenon, known as self-resonance, has important\\nimplications in cosmology. Notably, since scalar perturbations couple to tensor\\nperturbations at second order in the equations of motion, this amplification\\nresults in the production of Gravitational Waves (GWs), referred to as\\nScalar-Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGWs). In this study, we investigate the\\nproduction of SIGWs during the preheating phase for a class of inflationary\\nmodels known as $\\\\alpha$-attractors, characterized by a single parameter\\n$\\\\alpha$. We focus on small values of this parameter, specifically $\\\\alpha \\\\sim\\nO(10^{-1} - 10^{-4})$, where the self-resonance effect is particularly\\npronounced. We obtain lower bounds on this parameter, $\\\\log_{10}(\\\\alpha)>-3.54$\\nfor the T-model and $\\\\log_{10}(\\\\alpha)>-3.17$ for the E-model, based on the\\nenergy density of SIGWs constrained by Big Bang nucleosynthesis, which\\nultimately translates into lower bounds on the tensor-to-scalar ratio,\\n$r>9.61\\\\times10^{-7}$ for the T-model and $r>2.25\\\\times10^{-6}$ for the\\nE-model.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T14:27:44Z\"}"}
