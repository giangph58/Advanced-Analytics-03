{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05779v1\", \"title\": \"FASR-Net: Unsupervised Shadow Removal Leveraging Inherent Frequency\\n  Priors\", \"summary\": \"Shadow removal is challenging due to the complex interaction of geometry,\\nlighting, and environmental factors. Existing unsupervised methods often\\noverlook shadow-specific priors, leading to incomplete shadow recovery. To\\naddress this issue, we propose a novel unsupervised Frequency Aware Shadow\\nRemoval Network (FASR-Net), which leverages the inherent frequency\\ncharacteristics of shadow regions. Specifically, the proposed Wavelet Attention\\nDownsampling Module (WADM) integrates wavelet-based image decomposition and\\ndeformable attention, effectively breaking down the image into frequency\\ncomponents to enhance shadow details within specific frequency bands. We also\\nintroduce several new loss functions for precise shadow-free image\\nreproduction: a frequency loss to capture image component details, a\\nbrightness-chromaticity loss that references the chromaticity of shadow-free\\nregions, and an alignment loss to ensure smooth transitions between shadowed\\nand shadow-free regions. Experimental results on the AISTD and SRD datasets\\ndemonstrate that our method achieves superior shadow removal performance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T08:00:58Z\"}"}
