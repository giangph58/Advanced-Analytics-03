{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05304v1\", \"title\": \"Information-theoretic characterization of turbulence intermittency\", \"summary\": \"We present a new characterization of small-scale intermittency of turbulence\\nbased on an information-theoretic measure, that inherently segregates\\nturbulence intermittency from kinematic intermittency. Instead of the commonly\\nstudied higher-order moments, Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is used to\\nquantify the deviation of turbulence pseudodissipation rate (or dissipation\\nrate/enstrophy) from that of a Gaussian random velocity field as an accurate\\nmeasure of the small-scale intermittency arising from turbulence dynamics. In\\naddition, Shannon entropy is used to assess the uncertainty of these turbulence\\nsmall-scale quantities. Analysis of direct numerical simulation data of forced\\nhomogeneous isotropic turbulent flow reveals the existence of two critical\\nTaylor Reynolds numbers where the variation of uncertainty changes. The\\nKL-divergence measure reveals two striking results about intermittency: (i)\\nintermittency grows logarithmically with Reynolds number and (ii) dissipation\\nrate and enstrophy are equally intermittent in a turbulent flow of any Reynolds\\nnumber, if one considers only the intermittency arising from turbulence\\ndynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn,physics.data-an\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:50:36Z\"}"}
