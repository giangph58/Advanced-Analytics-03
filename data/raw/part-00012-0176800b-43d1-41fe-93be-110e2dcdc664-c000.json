In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that couples LLMs with\\nstructured representations and cognitively inspired manipulations to generate\\nmore creative and diverse ideas. Our notion of creativity goes beyond\\nsuperficial token-level variations; rather, we explicitly recombine structured\\nrepresentations of existing ideas, allowing our algorithm to effectively\\nexplore the more abstract landscape of ideas. We demonstrate our approach in\\nthe culinary domain with DishCOVER, a model that generates creative recipes.\\nExperiments comparing our model's results to those of GPT-4o show greater\\ndiversity. Domain expert evaluations reveal that our outputs, which are mostly\\ncoherent and feasible culinary creations, significantly surpass GPT-4o in terms\\nof novelty, thus outperforming it in creative generation. We hope our work\\ninspires further research into structured creativity in AI.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T11:13:06Z\"}"}
