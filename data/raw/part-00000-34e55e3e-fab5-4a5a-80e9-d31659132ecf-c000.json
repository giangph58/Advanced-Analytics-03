{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11891v1\", \"title\": \"Towards a Refined Understanding of Non-holomorphic Soft SUSY-Breaking\\n  Effects on the Higgs Boson Mass Spectra\", \"summary\": \"We study the impact of the non-holomorphic (NH) soft supersymmetry-breaking\\nterms $ T_{33}^{\\\\prime D} $ and $ \\\\mu^\\\\prime $, which introduce additional\\nSUSY-breaking effects beyond the holomorphic structure of the superpotential,\\non the Higgs boson mass spectrum in the NH Minimal Supersymmetric Standard\\nModel (NHSSM). The term $ T_{33}^{\\\\prime D} $ modifies the scalar bottom-quark\\nmass matrix and Higgs couplings, while $ \\\\mu^\\\\prime $ affects the mass matrices\\nof charginos and neutralinos. In our analysis, we incorporate constraints from\\ncharge- and color-breaking (CCB) minima where we find that a portion of the\\nparameter space is excluded by these constraints. Focusing on the allowed\\nparameter space, the NH contributions to the light $\\\\cal CP$-even Higgs boson\\nmass, $ M_h $, from $ \\\\mu^\\\\prime $ and $ T_{33}^{\\\\prime D} $ can reach up to $\\n1.4 \\\\,\\\\, \\\\mathrm{GeV} $ and $ 90 \\\\,\\\\, \\\\mathrm{MeV} $, respectively. For the\\nheavy $\\\\cal CP$-even Higgs boson mass, $ M_H $, and the charged Higgs boson\\nmass, $ M_{H^{\\\\pm}} $, these contributions can be substantially larger in\\ncertain regions of the parameter space, reaching up to $ 44 \\\\,\\\\, \\\\mathrm{GeV} $\\nfor $ M_H $ and $ 42 \\\\,\\\\, \\\\mathrm{GeV} $ for $ M_{H^{\\\\pm}} $ due to $\\n\\\\mu^\\\\prime $, and up to $ 60 \\\\,\\\\, \\\\mathrm{GeV} $ due to $ T_{33}^{\\\\prime D} $\\nfor both $ M_H $ and $ M_{H^{\\\\pm}} $. These corrections are significantly\\nlarger than the expected future experimental precision for Higgs boson masses\\nand should therefore be considered in precision analyses for future\\nexperiments.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T09:19:04Z\"}"}
