{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20545v1\", \"title\": \"WakeLoc: An Ultra-Low Power, Accurate and Scalable On-Demand RTLS using\\n  Wake-Up Radios\", \"summary\": \"For future large scale robotic moon missions, the availability of\\ninfrastructure-less, cheap and low power real-time locating systems (RTLSs) is\\ncritical. Traditional RTLS face significant trade-offs between power\\nconsumption and localization latency, often requiring anchors to be connected\\nto the power grid or sacrificing speed for energy efficiency. This paper\\nproposes WakeLoc, an on-demand RTLS based on ultra-wideband (UWB), enabling\\nboth low-latency and ultra-low power consumption by leveraging UWB wake-up\\nradios (WuRs). In WakeLoc, tags independently start a localization procedure by\\nsending a wake-up call (WuC) to anchors, before performing the actual\\nlocalization. Distributed tags equipped with WuRs listen to the WuC and use\\npassive listening of the UWB messages to determine their own position.\\nExperimental measurements demonstrate that the localization accuracy in a 2D\\nsetup achieves less than 12.9cm error, both for the active and the passive tag.\\nAdditional power simulations based on real-world measurements were performed in\\na realistic environment, showing that anchors can achieve a power consumption\\nas low as 15.53{\\\\mu}W while the RTLS performs one on-demand localization per\\nminute for 5 tags, thus operate up to 5.01 years on a single coin cell battery\\n(690mWh).\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T08:42:41Z\"}"}
