However,\\nthis is complicated by the complexity of the materials and reaction networks.\\nHere, we present a workflow for exploring transition states of elementary\\nreaction steps at inverse catalysts, which is based on the training of a neural\\nnetwork-based machine learning interatomic potential. We focus on the crucial\\nformate intermediate and its formation over nanoclusters of indium oxide\\nsupported on Cu(111). The speedup compared to an approach purely based on\\ndensity functional theory allows us to probe a wide variety of active sites\\nfound at nanoclusters of different sizes and stoichiometries. Analysis of the\\nobtained set of transition state geometries reveals different\\nstructure--activity trends at the edge or interior of the nanoclusters.\\nFurthermore, the identified geometries allow for the breaking of linear scaling\\nrelations, which could be a key underlying reason for the excellent catalytic\\nperformance of inverse catalysts observed in experiments.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cs.LG,physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T08:12:47Z\"}"}
