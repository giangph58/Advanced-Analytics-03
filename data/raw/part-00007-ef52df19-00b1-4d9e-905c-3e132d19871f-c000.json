Apart, current experimental constraints\\non flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) processes involving up-type quarks\\nalso provide scope to explore physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). In this\\narticle, we establish a connection between the flavor sector and the DM sector\\nwith minimal extension of the SM. Here a singlet complex scalar field, stable\\nunder $\\\\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry, acts as DM and couples to SM up-type quarks\\nthrough a heavy Dirac vector-like quark (VLQ), which shares the same\\n$\\\\mathbb{Z}_3$ charge as of the DM. The model thus addresses the observed\\n$D^0-\\\\bar{D^0}$ mixing, top-FCNC interactions, and $D^0$ meson decays, together\\nwith DM relic density, while evading the direct and indirect DM search bounds.\\nThe model can be probed at the future high-energy muon collider, through\\ndistinctive signatures of VLQ production, where the VLQ decays into DM and SM\\nparticles, abiding by the existing bounds.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:59:59Z\"}"}
