{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05305v1\", \"title\": \"Optimal Microgrid Sizing of Offshore Renewable Energy Sources for\\n  Offshore Platforms and Coastal Communities\", \"summary\": \"The global energy landscape is undergoing a transformative shift towards\\nrenewable energy and advanced storage solutions, driven by the urgent need for\\nsustainable and resilient power systems. Isolated offshore communities, such as\\nislands and offshore platforms, which traditionally rely on mainland grids or\\ndiesel generators, stand to gain significantly from renewable energy\\nintegration. Promising offshore renewable technologies include wind turbines,\\nwave and tidal energy converters, and floating photovoltaic systems, paired\\nwith a storage solution like battery energy storage systems. This paper\\nintroduces a renewable energy microgrid optimizer (REMO), a tool designed to\\nidentify the optimal sizes of renewable generation and storage resources for\\noffshore microgrids. A key challenge in such models is accurately accounting\\nfor battery degradation costs. To address this, the REMO model integrates a\\ndeep neural network-based battery degradation (DNN-BD) module, which factors in\\nvariables like ambient temperature, charge/discharge rates, state of charge,\\ndepth of discharge and battery health. Simulations on six test regions\\ndemonstrate that the REMO-DNN-BD approach minimizes lifetime energy costs while\\nmaintaining high reliability and sustainability, making it a viable design\\nsolution for offshore microgrid systems.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T14:51:30Z\"}"}
