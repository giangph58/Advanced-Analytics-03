However, on\\nthe path of scale-up, cross-talk from densely packed electrodes poses a severe\\nchallenge. While cross-talk onto the dot potentials is nowadays routinely\\ncompensated for, cross-talk on the exchange interaction is much more difficult\\nto tackle because it is not always directly measurable. Here we propose and\\nimplement a way of characterizing and compensating cross-talk on adjacent\\nexchange interactions by following the singlet-triplet avoided crossing in Ge.\\nWe show that we can easily identify the barrier-to-barrier cross-talk element\\nwithout knowledge of the particular exchange value in a 2x4 quantum dot array.\\nWe uncover striking differences among these cross-talk elements which can be\\nlinked to the geometry of the device and the barrier gate fan-out. We validate\\nthe methodology by tuning up four-spin Heisenberg chains. The same methodology\\nshould be applicable to longer chains of spins and to other semiconductor\\nplatforms in which mixing of the singlet and the lowest-energy triplet is\\npresent or can be engineered. Additionally, this procedure is well suited for\\nautomated tuning routines as we obtain a stand-out feature that can be easily\\ntracked and directly returns the magnitude of the cross-talk.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T08:50:43Z\"}"}
