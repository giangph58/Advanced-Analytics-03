When forecasting the subsequent time frames, we directly\\nretrieve historical data candidates from the training dataset with patterns\\nmost similar to the input, and utilize the future values of these candidates\\nalongside the inputs to obtain predictions. This simple approach augments the\\nmodel's capacity by externally providing information about past patterns via\\nretrieval modules. Our empirical evaluations on ten benchmark datasets show\\nthat RAFT consistently outperforms contemporary baselines with an average win\\nratio of 86%.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T06:26:11Z\"}"}
