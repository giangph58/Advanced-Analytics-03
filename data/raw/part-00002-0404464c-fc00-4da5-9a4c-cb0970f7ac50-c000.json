The\\nrenormalization is defined for more general maps that we call interval exchange\\ntransformations with gaps (g-GIETs), namely partially defined GIETs which\\nappear naturally as the first return map of $C^r$-flows on two-dimensional\\nmanifolds to any transversal segment. We exploit this renormalization scheme to\\nfind a decomposition of $[0,1)$ into finite unions of intervals which either\\ncontain no recurrent orbits, or contain only recurrent orbits which are closed,\\nor contain a unique quasiminimal. This provides an alternative approach to the\\ndecomposition results for foliations and flows on surfaces by Levitt, Gutierrez\\nand Gardiner from the $1980s$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T11:58:18Z\"}"}
