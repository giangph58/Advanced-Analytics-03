{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21706v1\", \"title\": \"Vision Transformers in Precision Agriculture: A Comprehensive Survey\", \"summary\": \"Detecting plant diseases is a crucial aspect of modern agriculture - it plays\\na key role in maintaining crop health and increasing overall yield. Traditional\\napproaches, though still valuable, often rely on manual inspection or\\nconventional machine learning techniques, both of which face limitations in\\nscalability and accuracy. Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as\\na promising alternative, offering benefits such as improved handling of\\nlong-range dependencies and better scalability for visual tasks. This survey\\nexplores the application of ViTs in precision agriculture, covering tasks from\\nclassification to detection and segmentation. We begin by introducing the\\nfoundational architecture of ViTs and discuss their transition from Natural\\nLanguage Processing (NLP) to computer vision. The discussion includes the\\nconcept of inductive bias in traditional models like Convolutional Neural\\nNetworks (CNNs), and how ViTs mitigate these biases. We provide a comprehensive\\nreview of recent literature, focusing on key methodologies, datasets, and\\nperformance metrics. The survey also includes a comparative analysis of CNNs\\nand ViTs, with a look at hybrid models and performance enhancements. Technical\\nchallenges - such as data requirements, computational demands, and model\\ninterpretability - are addressed alongside potential solutions. Finally, we\\noutline potential research directions and technological advancements that could\\nfurther support the integration of ViTs in real-world agricultural settings.\\nOur goal with this study is to offer practitioners and researchers a deeper\\nunderstanding of how ViTs are poised to transform smart and precision\\nagriculture.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T14:50:02Z\"}"}
