To ensure that only tensile stresses and not compressive stresses\\ndrive crack growth, several models have been proposed that aim to distinguish\\nbetween compressive and tensile loads. However, these models have a critical\\nshortcoming: they do not account for the crack direction, and hence they cannot\\ndistinguish between crack-normal tensile stresses that drive crack growth and\\ncrack-parallel stresses that do not.\\n  In this study, we apply a phase-field fracture model, developed in our\\nearlier work, that uses the crack direction to distinguish crack-parallel\\nstresses from crack-normal stresses. This provides a transparent energetic\\nformulation that drives cracks to grow in when crack faces open or slide past\\neach other, while the cracks respond like the intact solid when the crack faces\\ncontact under normal compressive loads. We compare our approach against two\\nwidely used approaches, Spectral splitting and the Volumetric-Deviatoric\\nsplitting, and find that these predict unphysical crack growth and unphysical\\nstress concentrations under loading conditions in which these should not occur.\\nSpecifically, we show that the splitting models predict spurious crack growth\\nand stress concentration under pure crack-parallel normal stresses. However,\\nour formulation, which resolves the crack-parallel stresses from the\\ncrack-normal stresses, predicts these correctly.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T15:14:50Z\"}"}
