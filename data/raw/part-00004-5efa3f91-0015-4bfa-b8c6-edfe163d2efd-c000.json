For the\\nbaryogenesis, additional scalar bosons are favored to couple mainly with the\\ntop quark with CP violations. However, if they also couple to light fermions of\\nthe Standard Model, the model is limited severely by EDMs, and additional CP\\nphases irrelevant to the baryogenesis are often introduced to cancel the\\ncontributions to the EDMs. Alternatively, we consider a scenario where the\\nlight-fermion couplings are suppressed to avoid the constraints. In our\\nscenario, it is found that the leading contributions arise in the top-quark\\nEDMs at the two-loop level. They induce the electron, neutron, and proton EDMs\\nvia radiative corrections. Since there is no additional CP-violating phase,\\nthey are correlated with the baryon asymmetry. We show that our scenario is\\ncompatible with the current experimental bounds and is within the scope of\\nfuture EDM experiments.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T12:47:10Z\"}"}
