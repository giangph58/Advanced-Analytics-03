{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21670v1\", \"title\": \"COMI-LINGUA: Expert Annotated Large-Scale Dataset for Multitask NLP in\\n  Hindi-English Code-Mixing\", \"summary\": \"The rapid growth of digital communication has driven the widespread use of\\ncode-mixing, particularly Hindi-English, in multilingual communities. Existing\\ndatasets often focus on romanized text, have limited scope, or rely on\\nsynthetic data, which fails to capture realworld language nuances. Human\\nannotations are crucial for assessing the naturalness and acceptability of\\ncode-mixed text. To address these challenges, We introduce COMI-LINGUA, the\\nlargest manually annotated dataset for code-mixed text, comprising 100,970\\ninstances evaluated by three expert annotators in both Devanagari and Roman\\nscripts. The dataset supports five fundamental NLP tasks: Language\\nIdentification, Matrix Language Identification, Part-of-Speech Tagging, Named\\nEntity Recognition, and Translation. We evaluate LLMs on these tasks using\\nCOMILINGUA, revealing limitations in current multilingual modeling strategies\\nand emphasizing the need for improved code-mixed text processing capabilities.\\nCOMI-LINGUA is publically availabe at:\\nhttps://huggingface.co/datasets/LingoIITGN/COMI-LINGUA.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T16:36:39Z\"}"}
