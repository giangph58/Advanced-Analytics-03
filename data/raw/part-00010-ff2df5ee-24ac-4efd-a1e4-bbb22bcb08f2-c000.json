Established interventions in other fields centred\\naround attention awareness have shown positive results in mental well-being.\\n  We aim to test how effective a yoga intervention is in improving general\\nwell-being in the workplace. For that, we designed, implemented and evaluated\\nan eight-week yoga programme in a software development company. We used a\\nmixed-methods data collection, using a survey of six psychometric scales, pre\\nand post-intervention, and a weekly well-being scale during the programme. For\\nmethod triangulation, we conducted a focus group with the organisers to obtain\\nqualitative data. The quantitative results did not show any statistically\\nsignificant improvement after the intervention. Meanwhile, the qualitative\\nresults illustrated that participants felt better and liked the intervention.\\n  We conclude that yoga has a positive impact, which, however, can easily get\\noverlaid by contextual factors, especially with only a once-per-week\\nintervention.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T14:54:09Z\"}"}
