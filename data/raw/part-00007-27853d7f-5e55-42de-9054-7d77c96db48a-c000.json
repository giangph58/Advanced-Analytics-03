Objective: Our objective is to\\nevaluate how SRs report replication packages and to provide a comprehensive\\nlist of these packages. Method: We examined 528 secondary studies published\\nbetween 2013 and 2023 to analyze the availability and reporting of replication\\npackages. Results: Our findings indicate that only 25.4% of the reviewed\\nstudies include replication packages. Encouragingly, the situation is gradually\\nimproving, as our regression analysis shows significant increase in the\\navailability of replication packages over time. However, in 2023, just 50.6% of\\nsecondary studies provided a replication package while an even lower\\npercentage, 29.1% had used a permanent repository with a digital object\\nidentifier (DOI) for storage. Conclusion: To enhance transparency and\\nreproducibility in SE research, we advocate for the mandatory publication of\\nreplication packages in secondary studies.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T05:11:39Z\"}"}
