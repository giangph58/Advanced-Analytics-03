Mobility plays a critical\\nrole in maintaining wellbeing, yet the increasing frequency and intensity of\\nboth nuisance and high-impact floods due to climate change are expected to\\nsignificantly disrupt access to activities and destinations, thereby affecting\\noverall wellbeing. Addressing climate adaptation presents a complex challenge\\nfor policymakers, who must select and implement policies from a broad set of\\noptions with varying effects while managing resource constraints and uncertain\\nclimate projections. In this work, we propose a multi-modular framework that\\nuses reinforcement learning as a decision-support tool for climate adaptation\\nin Copenhagen, Denmark. Our framework integrates four interconnected\\ncomponents: long-term rainfall projections, flood modeling, transport\\naccessibility, and wellbeing modeling. This approach enables decision-makers to\\nidentify spatial and temporal policy interventions that help sustain or enhance\\nsubjective wellbeing over time. By modeling climate adaptation as an open-ended\\nsystem, our framework provides a structured framework for exploring and\\nevaluating adaptation policy pathways. In doing so, it supports policymakers to\\nmake informed decisions that maximize wellbeing in the long run.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T09:34:12Z\"}"}
