{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04868v1\", \"title\": \"On Scenario Formalisms for Automated Driving\", \"summary\": \"The concept of scenario and its many qualifications -- specifically logical\\nand abstract scenarios -- have emerged as a foundational element in\\nsafeguarding automated driving systems. However, the original linguistic\\ndefinitions of the different scenario qualifications were often applied\\nambiguously, leading to a divergence between scenario description languages\\nproposed or standardized in practice and their terminological foundation. This\\nresulted in confusion about the unique features as well as strengths and\\nweaknesses of logical and abstract scenarios. To alleviate this, we give clear\\nlinguistic definitions for the scenario qualifications concrete, logical, and\\nabstract scenario and propose generic, unifying formalisms using curves,\\nmappings to sets of curves, and temporal logics, respectively. We demonstrate\\nthat these formalisms allow pinpointing strengths and weaknesses precisely by\\ncomparing expressiveness, specification complexity, sampling, and monitoring of\\nlogical and abstract scenarios. Our work hence enables the practitioner to\\ncomprehend the different scenario qualifications and identify a suitable\\nformalism.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T09:23:46Z\"}"}
