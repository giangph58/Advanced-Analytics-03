{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12045v1\", \"title\": \"pix2pockets: Shot Suggestions in 8-Ball Pool from a Single Image in the\\n  Wild\", \"summary\": \"Computer vision models have seen increased usage in sports, and reinforcement\\nlearning (RL) is famous for beating humans in strategic games such as Chess and\\nGo. In this paper, we are interested in building upon these advances and\\nexamining the game of classic 8-ball pool. We introduce pix2pockets, a\\nfoundation for an RL-assisted pool coach. Given a single image of a pool table,\\nwe first aim to detect the table and the balls and then propose the optimal\\nshot suggestion. For the first task, we build a dataset with 195 diverse images\\nwhere we manually annotate all balls and table dots, leading to 5748 object\\nsegmentation masks. For the second task, we build a standardized RL environment\\nthat allows easy development and benchmarking of any RL algorithm. Our object\\ndetection model yields an AP50 of 91.2 while our ball location pipeline obtains\\nan error of only 0.4 cm. Furthermore, we compare standard RL algorithms to set\\na baseline for the shot suggestion task and we show that all of them fail to\\npocket all balls without making a foul move. We also present a simple baseline\\nthat achieves a per-shot success rate of 94.7% and clears a full game in a\\nsingle turn 30% of the time.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T13:01:44Z\"}"}
