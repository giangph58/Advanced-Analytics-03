Previous efforts have focused on responding to\\nspontaneous electro-mechanical faults and failures. However, many faults occur\\ngradually over time. Waiting until such faults have manifested as failures\\nbefore addressing them is both inefficient and unsustainable in a variety of\\nscenarios. This work argues that the principles of predictive maintenance, in\\nwhich potential faults are resolved before they hinder the operation of the\\nswarm, offer a promising means of achieving long-term fault tolerance. This is\\na novel approach to swarm fault tolerance, which is shown to give a comparable\\nor improved performance when tested against a reactive approach in almost all\\ncases tested.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.MA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T10:59:10Z\"}"}
