This\\nis a Type $I$ von Neumann algebra, since it is the algebra of the Rindler wedge\\nin the Rindler vacuum state. Subalgebras of finite regions are Type $III_1$.\\nThe argument uses the elegant results of Moore and of Alexandrov, Kazakov and\\nKostov. This model is well known to be integrable and have no black hole\\nexcitations. We have speculated that adding an interaction invisible in\\nperturbation theory to a large finite number, $M$, of copies of the model,\\nproduces a non-integrable model with meta-stable excitations having all of the\\nproperties of linear dilaton black holes. The algebra of fields is the tensor\\nproduct of $M$ copies of the $c = 1$ model's algebra, whether or not we add the\\nnon-integrable interaction. We argue that the infinite dimensional $c = 1$\\nalgebras are analogous to those of the boundary field theory in AdS/CFT, even\\nthough they appear to encode bulk causal structure. An IR cutoff on the\\nboundary renders them finite and causal structure must be formulated in terms\\nof an analog of the Tensor Network Renormalization Group. This is a time\\ndependent Hamiltonian flow, embedding smaller Hilbert spaces into larger ones.\\nIt is the analog of one sided modular inclusion in quantum field theory.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T13:04:09Z\"}"}
