We show that by applying a bias electric\\nfield and coupling a desired Rydberg state by a microwave field of proper\\nfrequency to another Rydberg state with opposite sign of the dipole moment, we\\ncan create a trapping potential for the atom at a prescribed distance from the\\nsurface. Perfectly overlapping trapping potentials for several Rydberg states\\ncan also be created by multi-component microwave fields. A pair of such trapped\\nRydberg states of an atom can represent a qubit. Finally, we discuss an optimal\\nrealization of the swap gate between pairs of such atomic Rydberg qubits\\nseparated by a large distance but interacting with a common mode of a planar\\nmicrowave resonator at finite temperature.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T15:59:35Z\"}"}
