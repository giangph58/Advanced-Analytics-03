While the code is capable of exploring general scenarios\\ninvolving an minimally coupled scalar field and perfect fluid, we focus on the\\nregime where the scalar field dominates the dynamics, particularly in the\\npost-inflationary scalar field-dominated scenario, where the universe is\\ngoverned by a rapidly oscillating scalar field for a period lasting a few\\n$e$-folds. We analyse the threshold for PBH formation under quadratic and\\nquartic potentials, evolving configurations from superhorizon scales. Our\\nresults confirm that a quartic potential behavior is similar to the\\nradiation-dominated universe, resulting in a PBH formation threshold close to\\nthe well-established value in radiation backgrounds. Conversely, in the\\nquadratic case, we observe a significant deviation from the expected dust-like\\nbehaviour, due to wave-like effects opposing the gravitational collapse. While\\nnumerical limitations prevent us from evolving a wide range of initial\\nconditions to determine a precise threshold for PBH formation, our findings\\nsuggest that PBH formation may be suppressed with respect to the pure dust\\nscenario, allowing the formation of stable solitonic structures instead. This\\nstudy highlights the importance of properly accounting for wave dynamics in\\noscillating scalar fields when characterising PBH formation.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:02:15Z\"}"}
