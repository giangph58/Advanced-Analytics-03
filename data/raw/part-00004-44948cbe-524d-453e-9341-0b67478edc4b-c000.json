We show the existence of a critical mass such that minimizers do\\nexist for any mass larger than or equal to the critical one, and do not exist\\nbelow it. At the dynamical level, in the one dimensional case, we show that the\\nground states are orbitally stable.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T06:43:17Z\"}"}
