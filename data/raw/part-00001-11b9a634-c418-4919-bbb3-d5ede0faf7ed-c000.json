{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07942v1\", \"title\": \"MARS: a Multimodal Alignment and Ranking System for Few-Shot\\n  Segmentation\", \"summary\": \"Current Few Shot Segmentation literature lacks a mask selection method that\\ngoes beyond visual similarity between the query and example images, leading to\\nsuboptimal predictions. We present MARS, a plug-and-play ranking system that\\nleverages multimodal cues to filter and merge mask proposals robustly. Starting\\nfrom a set of mask predictions for a single query image, we score, filter, and\\nmerge them to improve results. Proposals are evaluated using multimodal scores\\ncomputed at local and global levels. Extensive experiments on COCO-20i,\\nPascal-5i, LVIS-92i, and FSS-1000 demonstrate that integrating all four scoring\\ncomponents is crucial for robust ranking, validating our contribution. As MARS\\ncan be effortlessly integrated with various mask proposal systems, we deploy it\\nacross a wide range of top-performer methods and achieve new state-of-the-art\\nresults on multiple existing benchmarks. Code will be available upon\\nacceptance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:53:23Z\"}"}
