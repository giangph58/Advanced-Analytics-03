{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04742v1\", \"title\": \"Unveiling Physical Conditions and Star Formation Processes in the G47\\n  Filamentary Cloud\", \"summary\": \"We present a multi-wavelength study of the filamentary cloud G47 (d\\n$\\\\sim$4.44 kpc), which hosts the mid-infrared bubbles N98, B1, and B2. The\\nSMGPS 1.3 GHz continuum map detects ionized emission toward all the bubbles,\\nmarking the first detection of ionized emission toward the B2 bubble. Analysis\\nof the unWISE 12.0 $\\\\mu$m image, Spitzer 8.0 $\\\\mu$m image, and the Herschel\\ncolumn density and temperature maps reveals two previously unreported\\nhub-filament system candidates associated with the HII regions B2 and N98,\\nwhich are powered by massive OB stars. This indirectly favours the\\napplicability of a global non-isotropic collapse (GNIC) scenario for massive\\nstar formation in N98 and B2. The position-position-velocity diagram of FUGIN\\n$^{13}$CO(1-0) shows significant velocity variations from 61 to 53 km s$^{-1}$\\ntoward areas between B2 and N98, where the magnetic field morphology exhibits\\nsignificant curvature, and high velocity dispersion (i.e., 2.3--3.1 km\\ns$^{-1}$) is observed. This may be explained by the expansion of the HII\\nregions B2 and N98. The energy budget of the cloud, estimated using SOFIA/HAWC+\\nand molecular line data, suggests that the magnetic field dominates over\\nturbulence and gravity in G47. Furthermore, the radial column density and\\nvelocity profiles of G47 display signatures of converging flows in a sheet-like\\nstructure. The relative orientations between the magnetic field and local\\ngravity suggest that G47 may undergo gravitational contraction along the\\nmagnetic field lines once it becomes magnetically supercritical.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T05:36:27Z\"}"}
