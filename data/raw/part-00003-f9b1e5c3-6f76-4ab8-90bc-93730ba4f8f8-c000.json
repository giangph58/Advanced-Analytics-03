{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04190v1\", \"title\": \"The stability of generalized phase retrieval problem over compact groups\", \"summary\": \"The generalized phase retrieval problem over compact groups aims to recover a\\nset of matrices, representing an unknown signal, from their associated Gram\\nmatrices, leveraging prior structural knowledge about the signal. This\\nframework generalizes the classical phase retrieval problem, which reconstructs\\na signal from the magnitudes of its Fourier transform, to a richer setting\\ninvolving non-abelian compact groups. In this broader context, the unknown\\nphases in Fourier space are replaced by unknown orthogonal matrices that arise\\nfrom the action of a compact group on a finite-dimensional vector space. This\\nproblem is primarily motivated by advances in electron microscopy to\\ndetermining the 3D structure of biological macromolecules from highly noisy\\nobservations. To capture realistic assumptions from machine learning and signal\\nprocessing, we model the signal as belonging to one of several broad structural\\nfamilies: a generic linear subspace, a sparse representation in a generic\\nbasis, the output of a generic ReLU neural network, or a generic\\nlow-dimensional manifold. Our main result shows that, under mild conditions,\\nthe generalized phase retrieval problem not only admits a unique solution (up\\nto inherent group symmetries), but also satisfies a bi-Lipschitz property. This\\nimplies robustness to both noise and model mismatch, an essential requirement\\nfor practical use, especially when measurements are severely corrupted by\\nnoise. These findings provide theoretical support for a wide class of\\nscientific problems under modern structural assumptions, and they offer strong\\nfoundations for developing robust algorithms in high-noise regimes.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP,cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T07:39:46Z\"}"}
