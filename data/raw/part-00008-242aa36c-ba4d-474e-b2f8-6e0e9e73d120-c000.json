{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15748v1\", \"title\": \"Detection of an Explosive Outflow in G34.26+0.15\", \"summary\": \"This paper reports on the detection of a likely explosive outflow in the\\nhigh-mass star-forming complex G34.26+0.15, adding to the small number (six) of\\nexplosive outflows detected so far. ALMA CO(2-1) and SiO(5-4) archival\\nobservations reveal multiple outflow streamers from G34.26+0.15, which\\ncorrelate well with H2 jets identified from Spitzer-IRAC 4.5 um and [4.5]/[3.6]\\nflux ratio maps. These nearly linear outflow streamers originate from a common\\ncenter within an ultracompact HII region located in the complex. The velocity\\nspread of the outflow streamers ranges from 0 to 120 km/s. The radial\\nvelocities of these streamers follow the Hubble-Lema\\\\^itre velocity law,\\nindicating an explosive nature. From the CO emission, the total outflow mass,\\nmomentum, and outflow energy are estimated to be ~264 M_sun, 4.3*10^3 M_sun\\nkm/s, and 10^48 erg, respectively. The event triggering the outflow may have\\noccurred about 19,000 years ago and could also be responsible for powering the\\nexpanding UC HII region, given the similar dynamical ages and positional\\ncoincidence of the UC HII region with the origin of the outflow. The magnetic\\nfield lines in the region associated with G34.26+0.15 also appear to align with\\nthe direction of the outflow streamers and jets, possibly being dragged by the\\nexplosive outflow.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T09:51:07Z\"}"}
