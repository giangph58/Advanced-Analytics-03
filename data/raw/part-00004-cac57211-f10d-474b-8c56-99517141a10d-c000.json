{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19558v1\", \"title\": \"Cholic Acid-Based Mixed Micelles as siRNA Delivery Agents for Gene\\n  Therapy\", \"summary\": \"Gene therapy is a promising tool for the treatment of various cancers but is\\nhindered by the physico-chemical properties of siRNA and needs a suitable\\nvector for the delivery of siRNA to the target tissue. Bile acid-based block\\ncopolymers offers certain advantages for the loading and delivery of siRNA\\nsince they can efficiently complex siRNA and bile acids are biocompatible\\nendogenous molecules. In this study, we demonstrate the use of lipids as\\nco-surfactants for the preparation of mixed micelles to improve the siRNA\\ndelivery of cholic acid-based block copolymers. Poly(allyl glycidyl ether)\\n(PAGE) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) were polymerized on the surface of\\ncholic acid to afford a star-shaped block copolymer with four arms\\n(CA-PAGE-b-PEG)4. The allyl groups of PAGE were functionalized to bear primary\\nor tertiary amines and folic acid was grafted onto the PEG chain end to\\nincrease cell uptake. (CA-PAGE-b-PEG)4 functionalized with either primary or\\ntertiary amines show high siRNA complexation with close to 100% complexation at\\nN/P ratio of 8. Uniform aggregates with diameters between 181 and 188 nm were\\nobtained. DOPE, DSPE-PEG2k, and DSPE-PEG5k lipids were added as co-surfactants\\nto help stabilize the nanoparticles in the cell culture media. Mixed micelles\\nhad high siRNA loading with close to 100% functionalization at N/P ratio of 16\\nand diameters ranging from 153 to 221 nm. The presence of lipids in the mixed\\nmicelles improved cell uptake with a concomitant siRNA transfection in HeLa and\\nHeLa-GFP model cells, respectively.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T08:06:36Z\"}"}
