The quantum walk is implemented on a\\nlattice with an internal space of $n_q=4$--qubits, used to encode the classical\\nfield amplitudes. Unitary rotation gates operate within this internal space to\\ngenerate the non-trivial dynamics of the free plasma-Dirac equation. To\\nincorporate the contributions from the cyclotron and plasma density\\nterms--manifesting as inhomogeneous potential terms--in the plasma-Dirac\\nequation, the walk process is complemented with unitary potential operators.\\nThis leads to a unitary qubit lattice sequence that recovers the plasma-Dirac\\nequation under a second-order accurate discretization scheme. The proposed\\nalgorithm is explicit and demonstrates, in the worst case, a polynomial quantum\\nadvantage compared to the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) classical method\\nin terms of resource requirements and error complexity. In addition, we extend\\nthe algorithm to include dissipative effects by introducing a phenomenological\\ncollision frequency between plasma species. Then, a post-selective\\ntime-marching implementation scheme is delineated, featuring a non-vanishing\\noverall success probability and, subsequently, eliminating the need for\\namplitude amplification of the output state while preserving the quantum\\nadvantage.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:28:41Z\"}"}
