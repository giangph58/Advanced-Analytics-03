{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02593v1\", \"title\": \"On Average Distance, Level-1 Fourier Weight, and Chang's Lemma\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we improve the well-known level-1 weight bound, also known as\\nChang's lemma, by using an induction method. Our bounds are close to optimal no\\nmatter when the set is large or small. Our bounds can be seen as bounds on the\\nminimum average distance problem, since maximizing the level-1 weight is\\nequivalent to minimizing the average distance. We apply our new bounds to\\nimprove the Friedgut--Kalai--Naor theorem. We also derive the sharp version for\\nChang's original lemma for $\\\\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}$. That is, we show that in\\n$\\\\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}$, Hamming balls maximize the dimension of the space spanned\\nby large Fourier coefficients.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,cs.DM,cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T13:55:39Z\"}"}
