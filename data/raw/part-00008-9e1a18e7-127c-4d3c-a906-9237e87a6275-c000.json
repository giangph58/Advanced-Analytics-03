If sensitivity of the test to detect\\nearly-stage cancers is high, using it as part of a screening programme may lead\\nto better cancer outcomes, but available evidence indicates there is\\nheterogeneity in sensitivity between cancer types and stages. We describe a\\nframework for sharing evidence on test sensitivity between cancer types and/or\\nstages, examining whether models with different sharing assumptions are\\nsupported by the evidence and considering how further data could be used to\\nstrengthen inference. Bayesian hierarchical models were fitted, and the impact\\nof information sharing in increasing precision of the estimates of test\\nsensitivity for different cancer types and stages was examined. Assumptions on\\nsharing were informed by evidence from a review of the literature on the\\ndeterminants of ctDNA shedding and its detection in a blood test. Support was\\nstrongest for the assumption that sensitivity can be shared only across stage 4\\nfor all cancer types. There was also support for the assumption that\\nsensitivities can be shared across cancer types for each stage, if cancer types\\nexpected to have low sensitivity are excluded which increased precision of\\nearly-stage cancer sensitivity estimates and was considered the most\\nappropriate model. High heterogeneity limited improvements in precision. For\\nfuture research, elicitation of expert opinion could inform more realistic\\nsharing assumptions.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T11:13:16Z\"}"}
