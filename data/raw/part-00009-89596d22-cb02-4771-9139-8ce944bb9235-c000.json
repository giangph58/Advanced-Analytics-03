{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21469v1\", \"title\": \"Turning a Disposable Bronchoscope into a Dynamic Speckle Imaging Tool:\\n  Yes, It Works\", \"summary\": \"Dynamic speckle imaging, typically used in laser-illuminated surface\\ndiagnostics, has proven valuable for assessing biological activity. In this\\nwork, we demonstrate its feasibility in an endoscopic context using a\\ndisposable bronchoscope. Despite technical limitations and aliasing artifacts,\\nour preliminary results show discernible vascular structures, indicating\\npotential for minimally invasive diagnostic applications. It is important to\\nnote that the imaging systems used in this study are designed primarily for\\nclinical robustness and classical imaging, including single-use sterility, ease\\nof handling, and real-time visualization, and not for scientific fidelity of\\nvisual data or computational post-processing. As such, they are not inherently\\nsuited to dynamic speckle analysis, which requires precise control over\\ntemporal acquisition parameters, linear response characteristics of the imaging\\nsensor, and stable illumination conditions, particularly from the coherent\\nlaser source. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that, even within these\\nconstraints, dynamic speckle imaging is indeed achievable. This opens the door\\nto further adaptation and optimization of such clinical imaging tools for\\nfunctional biomedical investigations.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det,physics.med-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T09:47:43Z\"}"}
