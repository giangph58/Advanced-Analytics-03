{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01746v1\", \"title\": \"Spans of quantum-inequality projections\", \"summary\": \"A hereditarily atomic von Neumann algebra $A$ is a $W^*$ product of matrix\\nalgebras, regarded as the underlying function algebra of a quantum set.\\nProjections in $A\\\\overline{\\\\otimes}A^{\\\\circ}$ are interpreted as quantum binary\\nrelations on $A$, with the supremum of all $p\\\\otimes (1-p)$ representing\\nquantum inequality. We prove that the symmetrized weak$^*$-closed linear span\\nof all such quantum-inequality projections is precisely the symmetric summand\\nof the joint kernel of multiplication and opposite multiplication, a result\\nvalid without the symmetrization qualification for plain matrix algebras. The\\nproof exploits the symmetries of the spaces involved under the compact unitary\\ngroup of $A$, and related results include a classification of those von Neumann\\nalgebras (hereditarily atomic or not) for which the unitary group operates\\njointly continuously with respect to the weak$^*$ topology.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OA\", \"categories\": \"math.OA,math.FA,math.QA,math.RA,math.RT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T13:57:34Z\"}"}
