Several conditions for\\nguaranteeing continuity of PWQ functions over state space partitions can be\\nfound in the literature. In this technical note, we show that these continuity\\nconditions are equivalent over so-called simplicial conic partitions. A key\\nelement in our proof is a technical lemma, which, in addition to being of\\nindependent interest, plays a crucial role in demonstrating the equivalence of\\nthese conditions. As a consequence, the choice of which condition to impose can\\nbe based solely on practical considerations such as specific application or\\nnumerical aspects, without introducing additional conservatism in the analysis.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T14:01:57Z\"}"}
