{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07537v1\", \"title\": \"Formalizing Representation Theorems for a Logical Framework with\\n  Rewriting\", \"summary\": \"Representation theorems for formal systems often take the form of an\\ninductive translation that satisfies certain invariants, which are proved\\ninductively. Theory morphisms and logical relations are common patterns of such\\ninductive constructions. They allow representing the translation and the proofs\\nof the invariants as a set of translation rules, corresponding to the cases of\\nthe inductions. Importantly, establishing the invariants is reduced to checking\\na finite set of, typically decidable, statements. Therefore, in a framework\\nsupporting theory morphisms and logical relations, translations that fit one of\\nthese patterns become much easier to formalize and to verify. The\\n$\\\\lambda\\\\Pi$-calculus modulo rewriting is a logical framework designed for\\nrepresenting and translating between formal systems that has previously not\\nsystematically supported such patterns. In this paper, we extend it with theory\\nmorphisms and logical relations. We apply these to define and verify invariants\\nfor a number of translations between formal systems. In doing so, we identify\\nsome best practices that enable us to obtain elegant novel formalizations of\\nsome challenging translations, in particular type erasure translations from\\ntyped to untyped languages.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LO\", \"categories\": \"cs.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T08:02:40Z\"}"}
