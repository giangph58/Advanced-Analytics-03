{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19924v1\", \"title\": \"Collaborative Inference for Sparse High-Dimensional Models with\\n  Non-Shared Data\", \"summary\": \"In modern data analysis, statistical efficiency improvement is expected via\\neffective collaboration among multiple data holders with non-shared data. In\\nthis article, we propose a collaborative score-type test (CST) for testing\\nlinear hypotheses, which accommodates potentially high-dimensional nuisance\\nparameters and a diverging number of constraints and target parameters. Through\\na careful decomposition of the Kiefer-Bahadur representation for the\\ntraditional score statistic, we identify and approximate the key components\\nusing aggregated local gradient information from each data source. In addition,\\nwe employ a two-stage partial penalization strategy to shrink the approximation\\nerror and mitigate the bias from the high-dimensional nuisance parameters.\\n{Unlike existing methods, the CST procedure involves constrained optimization\\nunder non-shared and high-dimensional data settings, which requires novel\\ntheoretical developments.} We derive the limiting distributions for the CST\\nstatistic under the null hypothesis and the local alternatives. Besides, the\\nCST exhibits an oracle property and achieves the global statistical efficiency.\\nMoreover, it relaxes the stringent restrictions on the number of data sources\\nrequired in the current literature. Extensive numerical studies and a real\\nexample demonstrate the effectiveness and validity of our proposed method.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:58:38Z\"}"}
