Recent studies\\nindicate a rising risk of AF with increasing OSA severity. However, the\\ncommonly used apnea-hypopnea index in clinical practice may not adequately\\naccount for the potential cardiovascular risks associated with OSA. (1)\\nObjective: to propose and explore a novel method for assessing OSA severity\\nconsidering potential connection to cardiac arrhythmias. (2) Method: the\\napproach utilizes cross-recurrence features to characterize OSA and AF by\\nconsidering the relationships among oxygen desaturation, pulse arrival time,\\nand heart-beat intervals. Multinomial logistic regression models were trained\\nto predict four levels of OSA severity and four groups related to heart rhythm\\nissues. The rank biserial correlation coefficient, rrb, was used to estimate\\neffect size for statistical analysis. The investigation was conducted using the\\nMESA database, which includes polysomnography data from 2055 subjects. (3)\\nResults: a derived cross-recurrence-based index showed a significant\\nassociation with a higher OSA severity (p < 0.01) and the presence of AF (p <\\n0.01). Additionally, the proposed index had a significantly larger effect, rrb,\\nthan the conventional apnea-hypopnea index in differentiating increasingly\\nsevere heart rhythm issue groups: 0.14 > 0.06, 0.33 > 0.10, and 0.41 > 0.07.\\n(4) Significance: the proposed method holds relevance as a supplementary\\ndiagnostic tool for assessing the authentic state of sleep apnea in clinical\\npractice.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.med-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.med-ph,eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T15:39:07Z\"}"}
