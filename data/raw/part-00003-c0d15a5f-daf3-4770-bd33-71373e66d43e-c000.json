We leverage\\nOntoAligner, a modular ontology alignment toolkit, to address this task by\\nintegrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques. Our approach\\nformulates the subject tagging problem as an alignment task, where records are\\nmatched to GND categories based on semantic similarity. We evaluate\\nOntoAligner's adaptability for subject indexing and analyze its effectiveness\\nin handling multilingual records. Experimental results demonstrate the\\nstrengths and limitations of this method, highlighting the potential of\\nalignment techniques for improving subject tagging in digital libraries.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T09:52:51Z\"}"}
