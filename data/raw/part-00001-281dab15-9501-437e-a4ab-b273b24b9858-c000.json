Using\\ncomplementary M\\\\\\\"ossbauer and nuclear forward scattering we determine the\\n$^{99}$Ru magnetic hyperfine splitting to be negligible. Inelastic X-ray and\\nneutron scattering derived lattice dynamics of RuO$_2$ are compared to density\\nfunctional theory calculations of varying flavors. Comparisons among theory\\nwith experiments indicate that electronic correlations, rather than magnetic\\norder, are key in describing the lattice dynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.other\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T07:26:54Z\"}"}
