In this article, we review the\\nmathematical foundations of proper scoring rules including general\\ncharacterization results and important families of scoring rules. We discuss\\ntheir role in statistics and machine learning for estimation and forecast\\nevaluation. Furthermore, we comment on interesting developments of their usage\\nin applications.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.ML,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T14:46:14Z\"}"}
