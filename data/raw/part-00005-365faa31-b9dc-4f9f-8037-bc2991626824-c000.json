The quadratic type of\\nequation of state parameter in the form $\\\\omega=-1 + \\\\alpha (1 + z) + \\\\beta (1\\n+ z)^2$, where $\\\\alpha$ and $\\\\beta$ are constants, is considered to determine\\nthe explicit solution of field equations and derive Hubble parameter in term of\\nredshift $z$. The model parameters are estimated taking observational datasets\\nof BAO, Pantheon, and CC using MCMC analysis. Some dynamical properties like\\nEOS parameter, energy density, pressure, and deceleration parameter are\\ndescribed. The cosmographic parameter like statefinders ($r,s$), jerk parameter\\n($j$) etc are also thoroughly explained. The energy conditions are also\\nexamined to validate the viability of the proposed model. We observe a\\ntransition redshift at $z_{t} = 0.942^{+0.112}_{-0.164}$ with the present value\\nof deceleration parameter $q_0 = -0.4815^{+0.0362}_{-0.0096}$.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T17:37:28Z\"}"}
