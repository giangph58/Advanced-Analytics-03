In recent years, many variant\\nmodels based on CF have achieved great success in clustering by taking into\\naccount the internal geometric manifold structure of the dataset and using\\ngraph regularization techniques. However, their clustering performance depends\\ngreatly on the construction of the initial graph structure. In order to enable\\nadaptive learning of the graph structure of the data, we propose a Concept\\nFactorization Based on Self-Representation and Adaptive Graph Structure\\nLearning (CFSRAG) Model. CFSRAG learns the affinity relationship between data\\nthrough a self-representation method, and uses the learned affinity matrix to\\nimplement dynamic graph regularization constraints, thereby ensuring dynamic\\nlearning of the internal geometric structure of the data. Finally, we give the\\nCFSRAG update rule and convergence analysis, and conduct comparative\\nexperiments on four real datasets. The results show that our model outperforms\\nother state-of-the-art models.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T10:12:59Z\"}"}
