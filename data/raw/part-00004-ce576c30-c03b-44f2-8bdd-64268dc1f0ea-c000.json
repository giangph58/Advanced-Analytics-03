In this work, we explore\\nthe multi-flavor lattice Schwinger model - a toy model inspired by quantum\\nchromodynamics - in one spatial dimension and with nonzero chemical potential\\nby means of variational quantum simulation on a shuttling-based trapped-ion\\nquantum processor. This fermionic problem becomes intractable for classical\\nnumerical methods even for small system sizes due to the notorious sign\\nproblem. We employ a parametric quantum circuit executed on our quantum\\nprocessor to identify ground states in different parameter regimes of the\\nmodel, mapping out a quantum phase transition which is the hallmark feature of\\nthe model. The resulting states are analyzed via quantum state tomography, to\\nreveal how characteristic properties such as correlations in the output state\\nchange across the phase transition. Moreover, we use the results to determine\\nthe phase boundaries of the model.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,hep-lat\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:43:57Z\"}"}
