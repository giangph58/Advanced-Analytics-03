To fully utilize\\npotential capacity and accommodate dynamic services, the DT must dynamically\\nupdate in sync with deployed optical networks throughout their lifecycle,\\nensuring low-margin operation. This paper proposes a dynamic-updating DT for\\nthe lifecycle management of optical networks, employing a hybrid approach that\\nintegrates data-driven and physics-informed techniques for fiber channel\\nmodeling. This integration ensures both rapid calculation speed and high\\nphysics consistency in optical performance prediction while enabling the\\ndynamic updating of critical physical parameters for DT. The lifecycle\\nmanagement of optical networks, covering accurate performance prediction at the\\nnetwork deployment and dynamic updating during network operation, is\\ndemonstrated through simulation in a large-scale network. Up to 100 times\\nspeedup in prediction is observed compared to classical numerical methods. In\\naddition, the fiber Raman gain strength, amplifier frequency-dependent gain\\nprofile, and connector loss between fiber and amplifier on C and L bands can be\\nsimultaneously updated. Moreover, the dynamic-updating DT is verified on a\\nfield-trial C+L-band transmission link, achieving a maximum accuracy\\nimprovement of 1.4 dB for performance estimation post-device replacement.\\nOverall, the dynamic-updating DT holds promise for driving the next-generation\\noptical networks towards lifecycle autonomous management.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T08:17:56Z\"}"}
