Our new approach demonstrates a very good detection\\naccuracy; a total of 92% of predicted pitch contours have strong or moderate\\ncorrelations to the true pitch contours. Furthermore, the experimental\\ncomparison between our new approach and other state-of-the-art CNN methods\\nreveals that our approach can enhance the detection rate by approximately 5%\\nacross various Signal-to-Noise Ratio conditions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SD\", \"categories\": \"cs.SD,cs.AI,eess.AS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T16:01:25Z\"}"}
