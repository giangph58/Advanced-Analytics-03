It is found that in many cases the XGamma\\nhas more flexibility than the Exponential distribution. In this paper we\\nconsider the sum of independent XGamma distributions with different parameters.\\nWe showed that the probability density function of this distribution is a sum\\nof the probability density function of the Erlang distributions. As a\\nconsequence, we find exact closed expressions of the other related statistical\\nfunctions. Next, we examine the estimation of the parameters by maximum\\nlikelihood estimators. We observe in an applications a real data set which\\nshows that this model provides better fit to the data as compared to the sum of\\nthe Exponential distributions, the Hypoexponential models.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,math.PR,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T15:55:29Z\"}"}
