The\\nstandard inverse Ising problem with a complete dataset requires computing both\\ndata and model expectations and is computationally challenging because model\\nexpectations have a combinatorial explosion. Furthermore, in many applications,\\nthe available datasets are partially incomplete, making it difficult to compute\\neven data expectations. In this study, we propose a approximation framework for\\nthese expectations in the practical inverse Ising problems that integrates\\nmean-field approximation or persistent contrastive divergence to generate\\nrefined initial points and spatial Monte Carlo integration to enhance estimator\\naccuracy. We demonstrate that the proposed method effectively and accurately\\ntunes the model parameters in comparison to the conventional method.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ML\", \"categories\": \"stat.ML,cond-mat.dis-nn,cs.LG,physics.data-an\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T03:39:56Z\"}"}
