{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04942v1\", \"title\": \"Randomized Routing to Remote Queues\", \"summary\": \"We study load balancing for a queueing system where parallel stations are\\ndistant from customers. In the presence of traveling delays, the\\njoin-the-shortest-queue (JSQ) policy induces queue length oscillations and\\nprolongs the mean waiting time. A variant of the JSQ policy, dubbed the\\nrandomized join-the-shortest-queue (RJSQ) policy, is devised to mitigate the\\noscillation phenomenon. By the RJSQ policy, customers are sent to each station\\nwith a probability approximately proportional to its service capacity; only a\\nsmall fraction of customers are purposely routed to the shortest queue. The\\nadditional probability of routing a customer to the shortest queue, referred to\\nas the balancing fraction, dictates the policy's performance. When the\\nbalancing fraction is within a certain range, load imbalance between the\\nstations is negligible in heavy traffic, so that complete resource pooling is\\nachieved. We specify the optimal order of magnitude for the balancing fraction,\\nby which heuristic formulas are proposed to fine-tune the RJSQ policy. A joint\\nproblem of capacity planning and load balancing is considered for\\ngeographically separated stations. With well planned service capacities, the\\nRJSQ policy sends all but a small fraction of customers to the nearest\\nstations, rendering the system asymptotically equivalent to an aggregated\\nsingle-server system with all customers having minimum traveling delays. If\\neach customer's service requirement does not depend on the station, the RJSQ\\npolicy is asymptotically optimal for reducing workload.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T04:37:53Z\"}"}
