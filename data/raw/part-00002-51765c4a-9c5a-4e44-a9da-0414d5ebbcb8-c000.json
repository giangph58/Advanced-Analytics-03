A well-known result of Chevalley and Weil describes the\\n$k[G]$-module structure of cohomologies of $X$ in the case when the\\ncharacteristic of $k$ does not divide $\\\\# G$. It is unlikely that such a\\nformula can be derived in the general case, since the representation theory of\\ngroups with non-cyclic $p$-Sylow subgroups is wild in characteristic $p$. The\\ngoal of this article is to show that when $G$ has a cyclic $p$-Sylow subgroup,\\nthe $G$-structure of the de Rham cohomology of $X$ is completely determined by\\nthe ramification data. In principle, this leads to new formulas in the spirit\\nof Chevalley and Weil for such curves. We provide such an explicit description\\nof the de Rham cohomology in the cases when $G = \\\\mathbb Z/p^n$ and when the\\n$p$-Sylow subgroup of $G$ is normal of order $p$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG,math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:51:33Z\"}"}
