{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21753v1\", \"title\": \"Tailored Hotspots from Airy-Based Surface Plasmon Polaritons\", \"summary\": \"Surface plasmons have attracted growing interest from the photonics community\\ndue to their inherent ability to controllably confine light below the\\ndiffraction limit and their direct application in trapping and transporting\\nmatter at the nanoscale. This method, known as plasmonic tweezers, employs\\nconfined fields generated by either localized plasmons or surface plasmon\\npolaritons (SPP), which originate in the vicinity of nanostructure-based traps\\nor across structureless platforms, respectively. Herein, we present a new\\ntheoretical method for generating intense light hotspots and engineering their\\nfeatures by overlapping Airy SPPs (ASPP) at a smooth dielectric-metal\\ninterface. We coherently add pairs of Hermite-Gauss modes that belong to a\\nnovel complete basis set of finite-energy ASPPs, which yield highly confined\\nplasmonic hotspots ($\\\\approx \\\\lambda$/10) without the need of using any\\nnanostructured platform. Mode order and relative spacing parameters can be used\\nto tailor the intensity and quality factor of said hotspots, largely\\noutperforming their Gaussian-only-based counterparts. Our method opens a\\npromising venue to confine light at the nanoscale using ASPP-based structured\\nlight, which helps to advance the development of structureless plasmonic\\ntweezers and holds promising potential for its application in optical signal\\nprocessing and plasmonic circuitry.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T15:48:54Z\"}"}
