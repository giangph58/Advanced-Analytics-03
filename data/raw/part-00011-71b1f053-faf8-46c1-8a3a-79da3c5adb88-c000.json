Depending on the task, we might optimize\\nfor pose error, speed, collision, or similarity to a human demonstration.\\nMotivated by this, we present PyRoki: a modular, extensible, and cross-platform\\ntoolkit for solving kinematic optimization problems. PyRoki couples an\\ninterface for specifying kinematic variables and costs with an efficient\\nnonlinear least squares optimizer. Unlike existing tools, it is also\\ncross-platform: optimization runs natively on CPU, GPU, and TPU. In this paper,\\nwe present (i) the design and implementation of PyRoki, (ii) motion retargeting\\nand planning case studies that highlight the advantages of PyRoki's modularity,\\nand (iii) optimization benchmarking, where PyRoki can be 1.4-1.7x faster and\\nconverges to lower errors than cuRobo, an existing GPU-accelerated inverse\\nkinematics library.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T17:56:40Z\"}"}
