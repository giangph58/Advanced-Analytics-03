{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02534v1\", \"title\": \"Delineate Anything: Resolution-Agnostic Field Boundary Delineation on\\n  Satellite Imagery\", \"summary\": \"The accurate delineation of agricultural field boundaries from satellite\\nimagery is vital for land management and crop monitoring. However, current\\nmethods face challenges due to limited dataset sizes, resolution discrepancies,\\nand diverse environmental conditions. We address this by reformulating the task\\nas instance segmentation and introducing the Field Boundary Instance\\nSegmentation - 22M dataset (FBIS-22M), a large-scale, multi-resolution dataset\\ncomprising 672,909 high-resolution satellite image patches (ranging from 0.25 m\\nto 10 m) and 22,926,427 instance masks of individual fields, significantly\\nnarrowing the gap between agricultural datasets and those in other computer\\nvision domains. We further propose Delineate Anything, an instance segmentation\\nmodel trained on our new FBIS-22M dataset. Our proposed model sets a new\\nstate-of-the-art, achieving a substantial improvement of 88.5% in mAP@0.5 and\\n103% in mAP@0.5:0.95 over existing methods, while also demonstrating\\nsignificantly faster inference and strong zero-shot generalization across\\ndiverse image resolutions and unseen geographic regions. Code, pre-trained\\nmodels, and the FBIS-22M dataset are available at\\nhttps://lavreniuk.github.io/Delineate-Anything.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T12:37:04Z\"}"}
