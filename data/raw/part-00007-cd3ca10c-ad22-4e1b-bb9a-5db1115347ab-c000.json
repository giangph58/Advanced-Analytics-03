We study the problem of reconfiguring proportional committees:\\ngiven two proportional committees, is there a transition path that consists\\nonly of proportional committees, where each transition involves replacing one\\ncandidate with another candidate? We show that the set of committees satisfying\\nthe proportionality axiom of justified representation (JR) is not always\\nconnected, and it is PSPACE-complete to decide whether two such committees are\\nconnected. On the other hand, we prove that any two JR committees can be\\nconnected by committees satisfying a $2$-approximation of JR. We also obtain\\nsimilar results for the stronger axiom of extended justified representation\\n(EJR). In addition, we demonstrate that the committees produced by several\\nwell-known voting rules are connected or at least not isolated, and investigate\\nthe reconfiguration problem in restricted preference domains.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GT\", \"categories\": \"cs.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T15:03:19Z\"}"}
