We show that these\\nmaps yield rank inequalities for Heegaard Floer homology. To do so, we use\\nHanselman-Rasmussen-Watson's immersed curve interpretation of bordered Floer\\nhomology, extending their proof of a similar rank inequality corresponding to\\ndegree-1 maps to the solid torus. Our result provides further evidence for\\nKronheimer-Mowka's conjectured relationship between Heegaard Floer homology and\\ninstanton Floer homology.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GT\", \"categories\": \"math.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T15:03:39Z\"}"}
