{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15165v1\", \"title\": \"An Efficient Aerial Image Detection with Variable Receptive Fields\", \"summary\": \"Aerial object detection using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) faces critical\\nchallenges including sub-10px targets, dense occlusions, and stringent\\ncomputational constraints. Existing detectors struggle to balance accuracy and\\nefficiency due to rigid receptive fields and redundant architectures. To\\naddress these limitations, we propose Variable Receptive Field DETR (VRF-DETR),\\na transformer-based detector incorporating three key components: 1) Multi-Scale\\nContext Fusion (MSCF) module that dynamically recalibrates features through\\nadaptive spatial attention and gated multi-scale fusion, 2) Gated Convolution\\n(GConv) layer enabling parameter-efficient local-context modeling via depthwise\\nseparable operations and dynamic gating, and 3) Gated Multi-scale Fusion (GMCF)\\nBottleneck that hierarchically disentangles occluded objects through cascaded\\nglobal-local interactions. Experiments on VisDrone2019 demonstrate VRF-DETR\\nachieves 51.4\\\\% mAP\\\\textsubscript{50} and 31.8\\\\% mAP\\\\textsubscript{50:95} with\\nonly 13.5M parameters. This work establishes a new efficiency-accuracy Pareto\\nfrontier for UAV-based detection tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T15:16:13Z\"}"}
