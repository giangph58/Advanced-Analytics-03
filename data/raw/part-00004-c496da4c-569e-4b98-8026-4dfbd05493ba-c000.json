By Lyapunov theory, it is proved that\\nthe flow exists for all time and converges exponentially to a conformal factor\\nthat generates a hyperbolic surface whose lengths of boundary components are\\nprescribed positive numbers. Furthermore, a generalized combinatorial Yamabe\\nflow is introduced in the same geometry setting, with the long time existence\\nand convergence established. This result yields an algorithm for searching\\nbordered surfaces, which may accelerate convergence speed.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CV\", \"categories\": \"math.CV,math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T15:05:30Z\"}"}
