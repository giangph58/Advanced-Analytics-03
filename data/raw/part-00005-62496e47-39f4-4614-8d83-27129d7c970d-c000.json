In\\ntwo-loop massless QCD, we find such a representation of the amplitude\\nsingularities using a systematic ansatz reconstruction of the integrand from a\\npredicted integrated form. As an example application, we write the finite part\\nof an amplitude for the digluon production in quark annihilation for some\\nhelicity configurations as manifestly locally finite.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T16:30:16Z\"}"}
