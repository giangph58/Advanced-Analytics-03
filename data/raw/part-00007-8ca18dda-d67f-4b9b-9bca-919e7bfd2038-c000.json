Our results are consistent with (but with independent uncertainties\\nfrom) local cosmic-ray measurements, unlocking new probes into both\\nastrophysical and beyond-standard-model processes near the solar surface.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.SR,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T17:59:59Z\"}"}
