{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20862v1\", \"title\": \"Tabular Data Adapters: Improving Outlier Detection for Unlabeled Private\\n  Data\", \"summary\": \"The remarkable success of Deep Learning approaches is often based and\\ndemonstrated on large public datasets. However, when applying such approaches\\nto internal, private datasets, one frequently faces challenges arising from\\nstructural differences in the datasets, domain shift, and the lack of labels.\\nIn this work, we introduce Tabular Data Adapters (TDA), a novel method for\\ngenerating soft labels for unlabeled tabular data in outlier detection tasks.\\nBy identifying statistically similar public datasets and transforming private\\ndata (based on a shared autoencoder) into a format compatible with\\nstate-of-the-art public models, our approach enables the generation of weak\\nlabels. It thereby can help to mitigate the cold start problem of labeling by\\nbasing on existing outlier detection models for public datasets. In experiments\\non 50 tabular datasets across different domains, we demonstrate that our method\\nis able to provide more accurate annotations than baseline approaches while\\nreducing computational time. Our approach offers a scalable, efficient, and\\ncost-effective solution, to bridge the gap between public research models and\\nreal-world industrial applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T15:38:43Z\"}"}
