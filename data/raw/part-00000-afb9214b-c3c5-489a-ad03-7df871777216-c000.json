The algorithm presented in this paper works for any\\ndataset of $d$ categorical features and produces a differentially private\\nsynthetic dataset that answers all hierarchical queries, a special case of\\nmarginals, each with bounded maximum absolute error. The algorithm builds upon\\nthe TopDown mechanism developed for the 2020 US Census.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:33:43Z\"}"}
