To fully cover numerous tags in the deployment area, one often\\nneeds to deploy multiple readers, each of which communicates with tags within\\nits communication range. However, the actual backscattered signals from a tag\\nare likely to reach a reader outside its communication range and cause\\ninterference. Conventional TDMA or CSMA based approaches for interference\\navoidance separate readers' media access in time, leading to limited network\\nthroughput. In this paper, we propose TRIDENT, a novel backscatter design that\\nenables interference avoidance via frequency-space division. By incorporating a\\ntunable bandpass filter and multiple terminal loads, a TRIDENT tag can detect\\nits channel condition and adaptively adjust the frequency and the power of its\\nbackscattered signals. We further propose a frequency assignment algorithm for\\nthe readers. With these designs, all the readers in the network can operate\\nconcurrently without being interfered. We implement TRIDENT and evaluate its\\nperformance under various settings. The results demonstrate that TRIDENT\\nenhances the network throughput by 3.18x, compared to the TDMA-based scheme.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:33:18Z\"}"}
