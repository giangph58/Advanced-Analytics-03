We generalize the notion of\\nPoincar{\\\\'e}-Steklov (Dirichlet-to-Neumann) operator for the conductivity\\nproblem on such domains. From there, we prove the stability of the direct\\nproblem for bounded conductivities continuous near the boundary. Then, we turn\\nto the inverse problem and prove its stability at the boundary for Lipschitz\\nconductivities, which we use to identify such conductivities on the domain from\\nthe knowledge of the Poincar{\\\\'e}-Steklov operator. Finally, we prove the\\nstability of the inverse problem on the domain for W^{2,$\\\\infty$}\\nconductivities constant near the boundary. The last two results are valid in\\ndimension n $\\\\ge$ 3.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T08:06:18Z\"}"}
