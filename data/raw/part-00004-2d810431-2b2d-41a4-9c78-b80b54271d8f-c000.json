To address this limitation, we\\nintroduce the concept of quasi-irreducibility in this paper. The adjacency\\ntensor of a bipartite 2-graph is quasi-irreducible if that bipartite 2-graph is\\nnot bi-separable. This new concept reveals important spectral properties:\\nalthough all M$^+$-eigenvalues are M$^{++}$-eigenvalues for irreducible\\nnonnegative biquadratic tensors, the M$^+$-eigenvalues of a quasi-irreducible\\nnonnegative biquadratic tensor can be either M$^0$-eigenvalues or\\nM$^{++}$-eigenvalues. Furthermore, we establish a max-min theorem for the\\nM-spectral radius of a nonnegative biquadratic tensor.\", \"main_category\": \"math.SP\", \"categories\": \"math.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T11:37:10Z\"}"}
