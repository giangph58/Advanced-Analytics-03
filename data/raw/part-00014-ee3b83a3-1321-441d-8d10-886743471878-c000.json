{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14849v1\", \"title\": \"Language Models for Materials Discovery and Sustainability: Progress,\\n  Challenges, and Opportunities\", \"summary\": \"Significant advancements have been made in one of the most critical branches\\nof artificial intelligence: natural language processing (NLP). These\\nadvancements are exemplified by the remarkable success of OpenAI's GPT-3.5/4\\nand the recent release of GPT-4.5, which have sparked a global surge of\\ninterest akin to an NLP gold rush. In this article, we offer our perspective on\\nthe development and application of NLP and large language models (LLMs) in\\nmaterials science. We begin by presenting an overview of recent advancements in\\nNLP within the broader scientific landscape, with a particular focus on their\\nrelevance to materials science. Next, we examine how NLP can facilitate the\\nunderstanding and design of novel materials and its potential integration with\\nother methodologies. To highlight key challenges and opportunities, we delve\\ninto three specific topics: (i) the limitations of LLMs and their implications\\nfor materials science applications, (ii) the creation of a fully automated\\nmaterials discovery pipeline, and (iii) the potential of GPT-like tools to\\nsynthesize existing knowledge and aid in the design of sustainable materials.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T04:03:32Z\"}"}
