Suppose\\nthat $H$ and $K$ are normal in $B$ and $(H \\\\cap K)\\\\varphi = H \\\\cap K$.

Among other things, these conditions give new\\nfacts on the residual finiteness and the residual $p$-finiteness of the group\\n$\\\\mathbb{E}$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GR\", \"categories\": \"math.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T03:05:25Z\"}"}
