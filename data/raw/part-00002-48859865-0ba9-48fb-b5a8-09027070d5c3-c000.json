{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10955v1\", \"title\": \"Designing optimal subsidy schemes and recycling plans for sustainable\\n  treatment of construction and demolition waste\", \"summary\": \"More than 10 billion tons of construction and demolition waste (CW) are\\ngenerated globally each year, exerting a significant impact on the environment.\\nIn the CW recycling process, the government and the carrier are the two primary\\nstakeholders. The carrier is responsible for transporting CW from production\\nsites to backfill sites or processing facilities, with a primary focus on\\ntransport efficiency and revenue. Meanwhile, the government aims to minimize\\npollution from the recycling system, which is influenced by transport modes,\\nshipment distances, and the processing methods used for CW. This paper develops\\na bi-objective, bi-level optimization model to address these challenges. The\\nupper-level model is a linear programming model that optimizes the government's\\nsubsidy scheme, while the lower-level model is a minimum-cost flow model that\\noptimizes the carrier's recycling plan. A hybrid heuristic solution method is\\nproposed to tackle the problem's complexity. A case study in Chengdu, China,\\ndemonstrates the computational efficiency of the model and its small solution\\ngap. With an optimized subsidy scheme and recycling plan, pollution can be\\nreduced by over 29.29% through a relatively small investment in subsidies.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T08:00:46Z\"}"}
