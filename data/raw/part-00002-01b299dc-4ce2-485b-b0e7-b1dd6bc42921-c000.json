Synchrotron\\nmeasurements of two-electron one-photon (TEOP) transitions in low-$Z$ atoms\\nhave revealed discrepancies between experimental results and theoretical\\npredictions of TEOP relative intensities. These discrepancies appear to\\noriginate from an incomplete description of an atom's response to the strong\\nperturbation caused by $K$-shell double photoionization (DPI). The\\nmulticonfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock relativistic configuration interaction\\nmethod has been applied for studying the TEOP spectra of Mg, Al, Si, S, Ar, and\\nCa atoms. The results show that branching ratios can be accurately reproduced\\nby accounting for the effects of core and valence electron correlations, as\\nwell as the outer-shell ionization and excitation processes following $K$-shell\\nDPI.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:53:16Z\"}"}
