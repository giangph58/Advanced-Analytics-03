However, one of the challenges in\\ndeploying robots in novel environments is finding the optimal base pose for the\\nrobot, which affects its reachability and deployment cost. Yet, the existing\\nresearch for automatically optimizing the base pose of robots has not been\\ncompared. We address this problem by optimizing the base pose of industrial\\nrobots with Bayesian optimization, exhaustive search, genetic algorithms, and\\nstochastic gradient descent and find that all algorithms can reduce the cycle\\ntime for various evaluated tasks in synthetic and real-world environments.\\nStochastic gradient descent shows superior performance with regard to success\\nrate solving over 90% of our real-world tasks, while genetic algorithms show\\nthe lowest final costs. All benchmarks and implemented methods are available as\\nbaselines against which novel approaches can be compared.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T08:36:17Z\"}"}
