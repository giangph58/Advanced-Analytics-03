We posit that a\\nlimiting factor for zero-shot coordination is the lack of shared task\\nabstractions, a mechanism humans rely on to implicitly align with teammates. To\\naddress this gap, we introduce HA$^2$: Hierarchical Ad Hoc Agents, a framework\\nleveraging hierarchical reinforcement learning to mimic the structured approach\\nhumans use in collaboration. We evaluate HA$^2$ in the Overcooked environment,\\ndemonstrating statistically significant improvement over existing baselines\\nwhen paired with both unseen agents and humans, providing better resilience to\\nenvironmental shifts, and outperforming all state-of-the-art methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MA\", \"categories\": \"cs.MA,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T17:19:17Z\"}"}
