Andreoletti and P. Debs \\\\cite{AndDeb3}. This is a crucial step toward\\nderiving the asymptotic behavior of these walks, whose limit is explicit and\\nreveals various characteristics of the process: the invariant probability\\nmeasure of the extracted coordinates away from the axes, the 1-stable\\ndistribution arising from the tail distribution of entry times on the axes, and\\nfinally, the presence of a Bessel process of dimension 3, which implies that\\nthe trajectory can be interpreted as a random path conditioned to stay within a\\nsingle quadrant.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:58:11Z\"}"}
