{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15902v1\", \"title\": \"Density Profiles of TNG300 Voids across Cosmic Time\", \"summary\": \"We present radial density profiles, as traced by luminous galaxies and dark\\nmatter particles, for voids in eleven snapshots of the \\\\texttt{TNG300}\\nsimulation. The snapshots span 11.65~Gyr of cosmic time, corresponding to the\\nredshift range $0 \\\\le z \\\\le 3$. Using the comoving galaxy fields, voids were\\nidentified via a well-tested, watershed transformation-based algorithm. Voids\\nwere defined to be underdense regions that are unlikely to have arisen from\\nPoisson noise, resulting in the selection of $\\\\sim100-200$ of the largest\\nunderdense regions in each snapshot. At all redshifts, the radial density\\nprofiles as traced by both the galaxies and the dark matter resemble inverse\\ntop-hat functions. However, details of the functions (particularly the\\nunderdensities of the innermost regions and the overdensities of the ridges)\\nevolve considerably more for the dark matter density profiles than for the\\ngalaxy density profiles. At all redshifts, a linear relationship between the\\ngalaxy and dark matter density profiles exists, and the slope of the\\nrelationship is similar to the bias estimates for \\\\texttt{TNG300} snapshots.\\nLastly, we identify distinct environments in which voids can exist, defining\\n``void-in-void\\\" and ``void-in-cloud\\\" populations (i.e., voids that reside in\\nlarger underdense or overdense regions, respectively) and we investigate ways\\nin which the relative densities of dark matter and galaxies in the interiors\\nand ridges of these structures vary as a function of void environment.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T13:42:12Z\"}"}
