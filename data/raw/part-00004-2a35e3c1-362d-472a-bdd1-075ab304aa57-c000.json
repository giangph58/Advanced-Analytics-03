{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16849v1\", \"title\": \"Magnetorotational instability in a solar mean-field dynamo\", \"summary\": \"We address the question whether the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) can\\noperate in the near-surface shear layer (NSSL) of the Sun and how it affects\\nthe interaction with the dynamo process. Using hydromagnetic mean-field\\nsimulations of $\\\\alpha\\\\Omega$-type dynamos in rotating shearing-periodic boxes,\\nwe show that for negative shear, the MRI can operate above a certain critical\\nshear parameter. This parameter scales inversely with the equipartition\\nmagnetic field strength above which $\\\\alpha$ quenching set in. Like the usual\\n$\\\\Omega$ effect, the MRI produces toroidal magnetic field, but in our Cartesian\\ncases it is found to reduce the resulting magnetic field strength and thus to\\nsuppress the dynamo process. In view of the application to the solar NSSL, we\\nconclude that the turbulent magnetic diffusivity may be too large for the MRI\\nto be excited and that therefore only the standard $\\\\Omega$ effect is expected\\nto operate.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T16:10:59Z\"}"}
