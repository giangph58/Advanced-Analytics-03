We have\\ncompactified the phase space coordinates, wherever necessary, and regulated the\\nnonlinear differential equations, constituting the autonomous system of\\nequations defining the dynamical system, at the cost of a new redefined time\\nvariable which is a monotonic increasing function of the standard time\\ncoordinate. We have shown that in most of the relevant cases the program is\\nexecutable although the two time coordinates may show different durations of\\ncosmological events. If one wishes one can revert back to the cosmological time\\nvia an inverse transformation. The present work establishes a standard norm for\\nstudying dynamical as well as stability issues in any new inflationary system.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T17:40:46Z\"}"}
