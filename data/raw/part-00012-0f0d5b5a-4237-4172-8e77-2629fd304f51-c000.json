{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16732v1\", \"title\": \"Simplified Swarm Learning Framework for Robust and Scalable Diagnostic\\n  Services in Cancer Histopathology\", \"summary\": \"The complexities of healthcare data, including privacy concerns, imbalanced\\ndatasets, and interoperability issues, necessitate innovative machine learning\\nsolutions. Swarm Learning (SL), a decentralized alternative to Federated\\nLearning, offers privacy-preserving distributed training, but its reliance on\\nblockchain technology hinders accessibility and scalability. This paper\\nintroduces a \\\\textit{Simplified Peer-to-Peer Swarm Learning (P2P-SL) Framework}\\ntailored for resource-constrained environments. By eliminating blockchain\\ndependencies and adopting lightweight peer-to-peer communication, the proposed\\nframework ensures robust model synchronization while maintaining data privacy.\\nApplied to cancer histopathology, the framework integrates optimized\\npre-trained models, such as TorchXRayVision, enhanced with DenseNet decoders,\\nto improve diagnostic accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\\nframework's efficacy in handling imbalanced and biased datasets, achieving\\ncomparable performance to centralized models while preserving privacy. This\\nstudy paves the way for democratizing advanced machine learning in healthcare,\\noffering a scalable, accessible, and efficient solution for privacy-sensitive\\ndiagnostic applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T14:04:15Z\"}"}
