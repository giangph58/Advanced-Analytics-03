Our vision is to design a fully autonomous prototype that\\ncan find its way to the next parking spot, high-demand area, or charging\\nstation. In this work, we propose a path following solution to enable\\nlocalization and navigation in an urban environment with a provided path to\\nfollow. We design a closed-loop architecture that solves the localization and\\npath following problem while allowing the e-scooter to maintain its balance\\nwith a previously developed reaction wheel mechanism. Our approach facilitates\\nstate and input constraints, e.g., adhering to the path width, while remaining\\nexecutable on a Raspberry Pi 5. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in\\na real-world experiment on our prototype.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.RO,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T15:01:01Z\"}"}
