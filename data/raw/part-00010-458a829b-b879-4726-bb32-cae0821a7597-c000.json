{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03394v1\", \"title\": \"EOPose : Exemplar-based object reposing using Generalized Pose\\n  Correspondences\", \"summary\": \"Reposing objects in images has a myriad of applications, especially for\\ne-commerce where several variants of product images need to be produced\\nquickly. In this work, we leverage the recent advances in unsupervised keypoint\\ncorrespondence detection between different object images of the same class to\\npropose an end-to-end framework for generic object reposing. Our method,\\nEOPose, takes a target pose-guidance image as input and uses its keypoint\\ncorrespondence with the source object image to warp and re-render the latter\\ninto the target pose using a novel three-step approach. Unlike generative\\napproaches, our method also preserves the fine-grained details of the object\\nsuch as its exact colors, textures, and brand marks. We also prepare a new\\ndataset of paired objects based on the Objaverse dataset to train and test our\\nnetwork. EOPose produces high-quality reposing output as evidenced by different\\nimage quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM and FID). Besides a description of the method\\nand the dataset, the paper also includes detailed ablation and user studies to\\nindicate the efficacy of the proposed method\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T10:17:32Z\"}"}
