{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14938v1\", \"title\": \"Integrating Response Time and Attention Duration in Bayesian Preference\\n  Learning for Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding\", \"summary\": \"We introduce a multiple criteria Bayesian preference learning framework\\nincorporating behavioral cues for decision aiding. The framework integrates\\npairwise comparisons, response time, and attention duration to deepen insights\\ninto decision-making processes. The approach employs an additive value function\\nmodel and utilizes a Bayesian framework to derive the posterior distribution of\\npotential ranking models by defining the likelihood of observed preference data\\nand specifying a prior on the preference structure. This distribution\\nhighlights each model's ability to reconstruct Decision-Makers' holistic\\npairwise comparisons. By leveraging both response time as a proxy for cognitive\\neffort and alternative discriminability as well as attention duration as an\\nindicator of criterion importance, the proposed model surpasses traditional\\nmethods by uncovering richer behavioral patterns. We report the results of a\\nlaboratory experiment on mobile phone contract selection involving 30 real\\nsubjects using a dedicated application with time-, eye-, and mouse-tracking\\ncomponents. We validate the novel method's ability to reconstruct complete\\npreferences. The detailed ablation studies reveal time- and attention-related\\nbehavioral patterns, confirming that integrating comprehensive data leads to\\ndeveloping models that better align with the DM's actual preferences.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T08:01:44Z\"}"}
