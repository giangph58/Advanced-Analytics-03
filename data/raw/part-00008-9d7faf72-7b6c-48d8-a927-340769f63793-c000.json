{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05735v1\", \"title\": \"Anomalous Maxwell-Garnett theory for photonic time crystals\", \"summary\": \"Maxwell-Garnett theory, dating back to James Clerk Maxwell-Garnett's\\nfoundational work in 1904, provides a simple yet powerful framework to describe\\nthe inhomogeneous structure as an effective homogeneous medium, which\\nsignificantly reduces the overall complexity of analysis, calculation, and\\ndesign. As such, the Maxwell-Garnett theory enables many practical applications\\nin diverse realms, ranging from photonics, acoustics, mechanics,\\nthermodynamics, to material science. It has long been thought that the\\nMaxwell-Garnett theory of light in impedance-mismatched periodic structures is\\nvalid only within the long-wavelength limit, necessitating either the temporal\\nor spatial period of light to be much larger than that of structures. Here, we\\nbreak this long-held belief by revealing an anomalous Maxwell-Garnett theory\\nfor impedance-mismatched photonic time crystals beyond this long-wavelength\\nlimit. The key to this anomaly lies in the Fabry-Perot resonance. We discover\\nthat under the Fabry-P\\\\'erot resonance, the impedance-mismatched photonic time\\ncrystal could be essentially equivalent to a homogeneous temporal slab\\nsimultaneously at specific discrete wavelengths, despite the temporal period of\\nthese light being comparable to or even much smaller than that of photonic time\\ncrystals.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T07:08:26Z\"}"}
