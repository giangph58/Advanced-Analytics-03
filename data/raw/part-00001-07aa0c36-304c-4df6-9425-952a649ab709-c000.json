Reflection and transmission\\nprobabilities of the wave packet, which in its single-mode limit are consistent\\nwith those in the stationary scattering off the potential step alone, are\\ninvestigated up to the second order. We show that even in the absence of the\\nso-called Klein region, a positive-frequency incoming wave can penetrate the\\nnegative-frequency region below the potential step by emitting its energy to\\nthe oscillating electric field with a finite tunneling probability.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T06:25:07Z\"}"}
