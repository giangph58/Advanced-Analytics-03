{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11026v1\", \"title\": \"A PyTorch-Compatible Spike Encoding Framework for Energy-Efficient\\n  Neuromorphic Applications\", \"summary\": \"Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer promising energy efficiency advantages,\\nparticularly when processing sparse spike trains. However, their\\nincompatibility with traditional datasets, which consist of batches of input\\nvectors rather than spike trains, necessitates the development of efficient\\nencoding methods. This paper introduces a novel, open-source PyTorch-compatible\\nPython framework for spike encoding, designed for neuromorphic applications in\\nmachine learning and reinforcement learning. The framework supports a range of\\nencoding algorithms, including Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF), Step Forward\\n(SF), Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), and Ben's Spiker Algorithm (BSA), as well\\nas specialized encoding strategies covering population coding and reinforcement\\nlearning scenarios. Furthermore, we investigate the performance trade-offs of\\neach method on embedded hardware using C/C++ implementations, considering\\nenergy consumption, computation time, spike sparsity, and reconstruction\\naccuracy. Our findings indicate that SF typically achieves the lowest\\nreconstruction error and offers the highest energy efficiency and fastest\\nencoding speed, achieving the second-best spike sparsity. At the same time,\\nother methods demonstrate particular strengths depending on the signal\\ncharacteristics. This framework and the accompanying empirical analysis provide\\nvaluable resources for selecting optimal encoding strategies for\\nenergy-efficient SNN applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T09:50:03Z\"}"}
