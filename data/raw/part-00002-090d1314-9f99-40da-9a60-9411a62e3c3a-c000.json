This scenario includes the cases of\\n{\\\\em depinning} and {\\\\em yielding}, which provide paradigmatic examples of out\\nof equilibrium phase transitions. In both cases, velocity of the manifold is\\nzero at low driving force, and increases smoothly when a critical driving is\\nexceeded,defining a continuous flow-curve for these systems. We show that when\\nmore general forms of the manifold elasticity are considered, the flow curve\\nmay become reentrant, and the transition hysteretic, or discontinuous. This\\nconstitutes a novel scenario for a discontinuous transition out of equilibrium.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech,cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T13:34:24Z\"}"}
