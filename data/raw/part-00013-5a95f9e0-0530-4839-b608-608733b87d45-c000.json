In this work, motivated by recent success\\nin predicting GB properties such as the shear coupling factor and mobility from\\nthe intrinsic properties of disconnections, we develop a systematic method to\\ncalculate the energy barriers for the nucleation and glide of individual\\ndisconnection modes under arbitrary driving forces. This method combines tools\\nfrom bicrystallography to enumerate disconnection modes and the NEB method to\\ncalculate their energetics, yielding minimum energy paths and atomistic\\nmechanisms for the nucleation and glide of each disconnection mode. We apply\\nthe method to accurately predict shear coupling factors of [001] symmetric tilt\\ngrain boundaries in Cu. Particular attention is paid to the boundaries where\\nthe classical disconnection nucleation model produces incorrect nucleation\\nbarriers. We demonstrate that the method can accurately compute the energy\\nbarriers and predict the shear coupling factors for low temperature regime.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T16:23:04Z\"}"}
