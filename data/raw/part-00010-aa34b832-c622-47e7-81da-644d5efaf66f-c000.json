In\\ncontrast to other related measures, like the weak/strong $2$-colouring numbers\\nor the maximum density of graphs that appear as $1$-subdivisions, the\\n$2$-admissibility can be computed in polynomial time. However, so far these\\nresults are theoretical only and no practical implementation to compute the\\n$2$-admissibility exists.\\n  Here we present an algorithm which decides whether the $2$-admissibility of\\nan input graph $G$ is at most $p$ in time $O(p^4 |V(G)|)$ and space $O(|E(G)| +\\np^2)$. The simple structure of the algorithm makes it easy to implement. We\\nevaluate our implementation on a corpus of 214 real-world networks and find\\nthat the algorithm runs efficiently even on networks with millions of edges,\\nthat it has a low memory footprint, and that indeed many real world networks\\nhave a small $2$-admissibility.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS,math.CO,F.2.2\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T10:55:01Z\"}"}
