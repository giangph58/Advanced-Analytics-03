We elucidate\\nthe role of phase transitions for primordial black hole formation in the early\\nUniverse and focus our attention to the cosmological QCD phase transition\\nwithin a recent microscopical model. We explore the impact of physics beyond\\nthe Standard Model on the cosmic equation of state and the probability\\ndistribution for the formation of primordial black holes which serve as dark\\nmatter (DM) candidates. We argue that besides primordial black holes also\\ndroplet-like quark-gluon plasma inhomogeneities may become gravitationally\\nstabilized for a sufficiently long epoch to distill baryon number and form\\nnuclear matter droplets which upon their evaporation may enrich the cosmos\\nlocally with heavy $r$-process elements already in the early Universe.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,astro-ph.CO,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T17:55:34Z\"}"}
