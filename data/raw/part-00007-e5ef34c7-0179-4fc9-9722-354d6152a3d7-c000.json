{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12748v1\", \"title\": \"Attack-Defense Trees with Offensive and Defensive Attributes (with\\n  Appendix)\", \"summary\": \"Effective risk management in cybersecurity requires a thorough understanding\\nof the interplay between attacker capabilities and defense strategies.\\nAttack-Defense Trees (ADTs) are a commonly used methodology for representing\\nthis interplay; however, previous work in this domain has only focused on\\nanalyzing metrics such as cost, damage, or time from the perspective of the\\nattacker. This approach provides an incomplete view of the system, as it\\nneglects to model defender attributes: in real-world scenarios, defenders have\\nfinite resources for countermeasures and are similarly constrained. In this\\npaper, we propose a novel framework that incorporates defense metrics into\\nADTs, and we present efficient algorithms for computing the Pareto front\\nbetween defense and attack metrics. Our methods encode both attacker and\\ndefender metrics as semirings, allowing our methods to be used for many metrics\\nsuch as cost, damage, and skill. We analyze tree-structured ADTs using a\\nbottom-up approach and general ADTs by translating them into binary decision\\ndiagrams. Experiments on randomly generated ADTS demonstrate that both\\napproaches effectively handle ADTs with several hundred nodes.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T08:41:07Z\"}"}
