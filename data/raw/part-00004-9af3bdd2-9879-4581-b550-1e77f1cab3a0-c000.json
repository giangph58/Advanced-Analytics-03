The rigidity we discuss here is related to\\nthe rigidity theorems presented by Mario Listing in his previous preprint. More\\nspecifically, we give some sufficient conditions for metrics not to be rigid in\\nthis sense. We also give several examples of Riemannian manifolds that satisfy\\nsuch sufficient conditions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T03:04:52Z\"}"}
