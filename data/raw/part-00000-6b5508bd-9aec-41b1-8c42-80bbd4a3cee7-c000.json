However, due to the\\nabsence of net magnetization in antiferromagnets, probing the energetically\\ndegenerate Neel orders has long remained a significant challenge. Inspired by\\nrecent advances in realizing the quantum anomalous Hall effect in AlOx-capped\\nlayered topological antiferromagnet MnBi2Te4, we demonstrate deterministic\\ncontrol over the Neel order through surface anisotropy engineering enabled by\\nthe AlOx capping layer. By tuning the surface anisotropy, we uncover\\nparitydependent symmetry breaking states that manifest as distinct odd-even\\nboundary architectures, including 180 degree domain walls or continuous spin\\nstructures. Comparative studies between AlOx-capped and pristine odd-layer\\nMnBi2Te4 flakes using domain-resolved magnetic force microscopy reveal\\npronounced differences in coercivity and magnetization-reversal dynamics.\\nNotably, an unconventional giant exchange bias, which arises from perpendicular\\nmagnetic anisotropy rather than traditional interface pinning mechanisms, is\\nobserved for the first time. Our findings establish a pathway for manipulating\\nNeel order through surface modification in A-type antiferromagnets, offering\\nnew opportunities for spintronic devices and quantum information technologies.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-14T14:01:21Z\"}"}
