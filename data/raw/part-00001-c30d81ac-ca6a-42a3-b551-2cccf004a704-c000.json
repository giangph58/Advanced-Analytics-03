{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21436v1\", \"title\": \"Whispers of Data: Unveiling Label Distributions in Federated Learning\\n  Through Virtual Client Simulation\", \"summary\": \"Federated Learning enables collaborative training of a global model across\\nmultiple geographically dispersed clients without the need for data sharing.\\nHowever, it is susceptible to inference attacks, particularly label inference\\nattacks.\\n  Existing studies on label distribution inference exhibits sensitive to the\\nspecific settings of the victim client and typically underperforms under\\ndefensive strategies. In this study, we propose a novel label distribution\\ninference attack that is stable and adaptable to various scenarios.\\nSpecifically, we estimate the size of the victim client's dataset and construct\\nseveral virtual clients tailored to the victim client. We then quantify the\\ntemporal generalization of each class label for the virtual clients and utilize\\nthe variation in temporal generalization to train an inference model that\\npredicts the label distribution proportions of the victim client.\\n  We validate our approach on multiple datasets, including MNIST,\\nFashion-MNIST, FER2013, and AG-News. The results demonstrate the superiority of\\nour method compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, our attack\\nremains effective even under differential privacy defense mechanisms,\\nunderscoring its potential for real-world applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T08:51:06Z\"}"}
