{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02373v1\", \"title\": \"HPGN: Hybrid Priors-Guided Network for Compressed Low-Light Image\\n  Enhancement\", \"summary\": \"In practical applications, conventional methods generate large volumes of\\nlow-light images that require compression for efficient storage and\\ntransmission. However, most existing methods either disregard the removal of\\npotential compression artifacts during the enhancement process or fail to\\nestablish a unified framework for joint task enhancement of images with varying\\ncompression qualities. To solve this problem, we propose the hybrid\\npriors-guided network (HPGN), which enhances compressed low-light images by\\nintegrating both compression and illumination priors. Our approach fully\\nutilizes the JPEG quality factor (QF) and DCT quantization matrix (QM) to guide\\nthe design of efficient joint task plug-and-play modules. Additionally, we\\nemploy a random QF generation strategy to guide model training, enabling a\\nsingle model to enhance images across different compression levels.\\nExperimental results confirm the superiority of our proposed method.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T08:06:24Z\"}"}
