{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11952v1\", \"title\": \"Robust and Fine-Grained Detection of AI Generated Texts\", \"summary\": \"An ideal detection system for machine generated content is supposed to work\\nwell on any generator as many more advanced LLMs come into existence day by\\nday. Existing systems often struggle with accurately identifying AI-generated\\ncontent over shorter texts. Further, not all texts might be entirely authored\\nby a human or LLM, hence we focused more over partial cases i.e human-LLM\\nco-authored texts. Our paper introduces a set of models built for the task of\\ntoken classification which are trained on an extensive collection of\\nhuman-machine co-authored texts, which performed well over texts of unseen\\ndomains, unseen generators, texts by non-native speakers and those with\\nadversarial inputs. We also introduce a new dataset of over 2.4M such texts\\nmostly co-authored by several popular proprietary LLMs over 23 languages. We\\nalso present findings of our models' performance over each texts of each domain\\nand generator. Additional findings include comparison of performance against\\neach adversarial method, length of input texts and characteristics of generated\\ntexts compared to the original human authored texts.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T10:29:30Z\"}"}
