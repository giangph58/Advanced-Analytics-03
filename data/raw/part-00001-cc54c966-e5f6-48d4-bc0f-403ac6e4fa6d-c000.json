{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17778v1\", \"title\": \"Flexoelectric polarization in chiral liquid crystals: electrostatic\\n  self-interactions of topological defects\", \"summary\": \"The presence of topological defects in apolar chiral liquid crystals cause\\norientational distortions, leading to non-uniform strain. This non-uniform\\nstrain generates an electric polarization response due to the flexoelectric\\neffect, which induces an internal electric field. Associated to this electric\\nfield is an electrostatic self-energy, which has a back-reaction on the\\ndirector field. Calculation of this internal electric field and its resulting\\nback-reaction on the director field is complicated. We propose a method to do\\nsuch, adapting a method recently developed to study the magnetostatic\\nself-interaction effect on skyrmions in chiral ferromagnets. Bloch skyrmions in\\nchiral magnets are solenoidal and are unaffected by the magnetostatic\\nself-interaction. However, Bloch skyrmions in liquid crystals yield\\nnon-solenoidal flexoelectric polarization and, thus, are affected by the\\nelectrostatic self-interaction. Additionally, as the flexoelectric coefficients\\nare increased in strength, a transition from a hopfion to a skyrmion is\\nobserved in three-dimensional confined systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T17:55:09Z\"}"}
