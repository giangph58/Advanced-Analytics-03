{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13002v1\", \"title\": \"The Role of Empathy in Software Engineering -- A Socio-Technical\\n  Grounded Theory\", \"summary\": \"Empathy, defined as the ability to understand and share others' perspectives\\nand emotions, is essential in software engineering (SE), where developers often\\ncollaborate with diverse stakeholders. It is also considered as a vital\\ncompetency in many professional fields such as medicine, healthcare, nursing,\\nanimal science, education, marketing, and project management. Despite its\\nimportance, empathy remains under-researched in SE. To further explore this, we\\nconducted a socio-technical grounded theory (STGT) study through in-depth\\nsemi-structured interviews with 22 software developers and stakeholders. Our\\nstudy explored the role of empathy in SE and how SE activities and processes\\ncan be improved by considering empathy. Through applying the systematic steps\\nof STGT data analysis and theory development, we developed a theory that\\nexplains the role of empathy in SE. Our theory details the contexts in which\\nempathy arises, the conditions that shape it, the causes and consequences of\\nits presence and absence. We also identified contingencies for enhancing\\nempathy or overcoming barriers to its expression. Our findings provide\\npractical implications for SE practitioners and researchers, offering a deeper\\nunderstanding of how to effectively integrate empathy into SE processes.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T15:13:18Z\"}"}
