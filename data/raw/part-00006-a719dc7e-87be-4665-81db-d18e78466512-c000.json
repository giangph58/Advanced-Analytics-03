In this paper, we\\npropose a spatial-enhanced reflective coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging\\nsystem (SE-RCASSI). The system achieves superior spatial results and high light\\nefficiency because of its specially designed structure. Then, we propose\\nSpatial-enhanced Network (SEnet) which takes full use of the prior information\\nof grayscale image to boost the reconstruction quality and can serve as an\\nimage fusion framework to deploy different algorithms. Furthermore, we propose\\nhybrid prior strategy (HPS) to effectively exploit the broad-scope prior of\\ntraining set and narrow-scope prior of measurements, resulting in improved\\ngeneralization and performance of the network. Finally, we fabricate the\\nprototype of SE-RCASSI and conduct experiments in different environments. Both\\nexperimental results and numerical simulations show the outstanding performance\\nof our method.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T07:58:06Z\"}"}
