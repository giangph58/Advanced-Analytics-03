NOCASA\\nchallenges participants to develop new systems that can assess single-word\\npronunciations of young second language (L2) learners as part of a gamified\\npronunciation training app. To achieve this, several issues must be addressed,\\nmost notably the limited nature of available training data and the highly\\nunbalanced distribution among the pronunciation level categories. To expedite\\nthe development, we provide a pseudo-anonymized training data (TeflonNorL2),\\ncontaining 10,334 recordings from 44 speakers attempting to pronounce 205\\ndistinct Norwegian words, human-rated on a 1 to 5 scale (number of stars that\\nshould be given in the game). In addition to the data, two already trained\\nsystems are released as official baselines: an SVM classifier trained on the\\nComParE_16 acoustic feature set and a multi-task wav2vec 2.0 model. The latter\\nachieves the best performance on the challenge test set, with an unweighted\\naverage recall (UAR) of 36.37%.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,eess.AS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T11:59:08Z\"}"}
