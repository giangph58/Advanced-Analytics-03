{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15616v1\", \"title\": \"SocialMOIF: Multi-Order Intention Fusion for Pedestrian Trajectory\\n  Prediction\", \"summary\": \"The analysis and prediction of agent trajectories are crucial for\\ndecision-making processes in intelligent systems, with precise short-term\\ntrajectory forecasting being highly significant across a range of applications.\\nAgents and their social interactions have been quantified and modeled by\\nresearchers from various perspectives; however, substantial limitations exist\\nin the current work due to the inherent high uncertainty of agent intentions\\nand the complex higher-order influences among neighboring groups. SocialMOIF is\\nproposed to tackle these challenges, concentrating on the higher-order\\nintention interactions among neighboring groups while reinforcing the primary\\nrole of first-order intention interactions between neighbors and the target\\nagent. This method develops a multi-order intention fusion model to achieve a\\nmore comprehensive understanding of both direct and indirect intention\\ninformation. Within SocialMOIF, a trajectory distribution approximator is\\ndesigned to guide the trajectories toward values that align more closely with\\nthe actual data, thereby enhancing model interpretability. Furthermore, a\\nglobal trajectory optimizer is introduced to enable more accurate and efficient\\nparallel predictions. By incorporating a novel loss function that accounts for\\ndistance and direction during training, experimental results demonstrate that\\nthe model outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines across multiple\\nmetrics in both dynamic and static datasets.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T06:14:49Z\"}"}
