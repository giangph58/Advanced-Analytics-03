A major limitation in improving qubit readout is\\nmeasurement-induced transitions, also referred to as qubit ionization, caused\\nby multiphoton qubit-resonator excitation occurring at specific photon numbers.\\nSince ionization can involve highly excited states, it has been predicted that\\nin transmons -- the most widely used superconducting qubit -- the photon number\\nat which measurement-induced transitions occur is gate charge dependent. This\\ndependence is expected to persist deep in the transmon regime where the qubit\\nfrequency is gate charge insensitive. We experimentally confirm this prediction\\nby characterizing measurement-induced transitions with increasing resonator\\nphoton population while actively stabilizing the transmon's gate charge.\\nFurthermore, because highly excited states are involved, achieving quantitative\\nagreement between theory and experiment requires accounting for higher-order\\nharmonics in the transmon Hamiltonian.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T17:28:57Z\"}"}
