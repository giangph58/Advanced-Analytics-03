{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17452v1\", \"title\": \"The need for statistical physics in Africa: perspective and an\\n  illustration in drug delivery problems\", \"summary\": \"The development of statistical physics in Africa is in its nascent stages,\\nyet its application holds immense promise for advancing emerging research\\ntrends on the continent. This perspective paper, a product of a two-week\\nworkshop on biophysics in Morogoro (Tanzania), aims to illuminate the potential\\nof statistical physics in regional scientific research. We employ in-silico\\natomistic molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the loading and\\ndelivery capabilities of lecithin nanolipids for niclosamide, a poorly\\nwater-soluble drug. Our simulations reveal that the loading capacity and\\ninteraction strength between lecithin nanolipids and niclosamide improve with\\nincreased lecithin concentrations. We perform a free-energy landscape analysis\\nwhich uncovers two distinct metastable conformations of niclosamide within both\\nthe aqueous phase and the lecithin nanolipids. Over a simulation period of half\\na microsecond, lecithin nanolipids self-assemble into a spherical monolayer\\nstructure, providing detailed atomic-level insights into their interactions\\nwith niclosamide. These findings underscore the potential of lecithin\\nnanolipids as efficient drug delivery systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech,physics.bio-ph,physics.chem-ph,physics.soc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T11:34:58Z\"}"}
