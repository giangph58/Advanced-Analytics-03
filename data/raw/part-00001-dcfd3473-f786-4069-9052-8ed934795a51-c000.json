{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04521v1\", \"title\": \"Comparative Analysis of Carbon Footprint in Manual vs. LLM-Assisted Code\\n  Development\", \"summary\": \"Large Language Models (LLM) have significantly transformed various domains,\\nincluding software development. These models assist programmers in generating\\ncode, potentially increasing productivity and efficiency. However, the\\nenvironmental impact of utilising these AI models is substantial, given their\\nhigh energy consumption during both training and inference stages. This\\nresearch aims to compare the energy consumption of manual software development\\nversus an LLM-assisted approach, using Codeforces as a simulation platform for\\nsoftware development. The goal is to quantify the environmental impact and\\npropose strategies for minimising the carbon footprint of using LLM in software\\ndevelopment. Our results show that the LLM-assisted code generation leads on\\naverage to 32.72 higher carbon footprint than the manual one. Moreover, there\\nis a significant correlation between task complexity and the difference in the\\ncarbon footprint of the two approaches.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T15:52:06Z\"}"}
