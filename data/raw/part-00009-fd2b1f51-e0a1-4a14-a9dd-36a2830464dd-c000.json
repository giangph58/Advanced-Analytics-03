{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15908v1\", \"title\": \"Learning the Spoofability of Limit Order Books With Interpretable\\n  Probabilistic Neural Networks\", \"summary\": \"This paper investigates real-time detection of spoofing activity in limit\\norder books, focusing on cryptocurrency centralized exchanges. We first\\nintroduce novel order flow variables based on multi-scale Hawkes processes that\\naccount both for the size and placement distance from current best prices of\\nnew limit orders. Using a Level-3 data set, we train a neural network model to\\npredict the conditional probability distribution of mid price movements based\\non these features. Our empirical analysis highlights the critical role of the\\nposting distance of limit orders in the price formation process, showing that\\nspoofing detection models that do not take the posting distance into account\\nare inadequate to describe the data. Next, we propose a spoofing detection\\nframework based on the probabilistic market manipulation gain of a spoofing\\nagent and use the previously trained neural network to compute the expected\\ngain. Running this algorithm on all submitted limit orders in the period\\n2024-12-04 to 2024-12-07, we find that 31% of large orders could spoof the\\nmarket. Because of its simple neuronal architecture, our model can be run in\\nreal time. This work contributes to enhancing market integrity by providing a\\nrobust tool for monitoring and mitigating spoofing in both cryptocurrency\\nexchanges and traditional financial markets.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.TR\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.TR,q-fin.ST\", \"published\": \"2025-04-22T13:52:55Z\"}"}
