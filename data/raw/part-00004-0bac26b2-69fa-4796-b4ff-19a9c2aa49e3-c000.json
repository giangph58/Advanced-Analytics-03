We develop a\\nnovel $\\\\text{CO}_2$ laser machining method that produces well-controlled\\nsurface profiles on the end facets of cleaved optical fibres. Using multiple\\nshots in distinct spatial distribution patterns, our method employs a shooting\\nalgorithm that adaptively changes laser ablation parameters during the shooting\\nto suppress deviations from the desired profile. This is made possible by\\n$\\\\textit{in situ}$ imaging of the machined profile, its inspection and the\\nusage of the information in the subsequent steps. Underlying this algorithm is\\na newly found laser ablation parameter, the pause between shots, which controls\\nthe accumulation of heat in between successive laser shots and as a result\\ndetermines the area of impact made by an individual ablation sequence. We\\nfabricate fibre-based micro-mirrors with radii of curvature ranging from 250\\n$\\\\mu$m to 700 $\\\\mu$m with an effective mirror diameter of 60 $\\\\mu$m in either\\nGaussian or spherical profiles. Due to the self-correcting nature of our\\nadaptive algorithm, we achieve a near 100\\\\% success rate in the production of\\ndesired profiles with low ellipticity. After furnishing the laser machined\\nfibre end facets with high reflectivity coating, FFPCs are formed to\\ndemonstrate a high finesse up to 150,000 at an optical wavelength of 854 nm.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T07:16:41Z\"}"}
