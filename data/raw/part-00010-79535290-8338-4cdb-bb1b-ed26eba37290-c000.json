{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12885v1\", \"title\": \"Optimizing Movable Antennas in Wideband Multi-User MIMO With Hardware\\n  Impairments\", \"summary\": \"Movable antennas represent an emerging field in telecommunication research\\nand a potential approach to achieving higher data rates in multiple-input\\nmultiple-output (MIMO) communications when the total number of antennas is\\nlimited. Most solutions and analyses to date have been limited to\\n\\\\emph{narrowband} setups. This work complements the prior studies by\\nquantifying the benefit of using movable antennas in \\\\emph{wideband} MIMO\\ncommunication systems. First, we derive a novel uplink wideband system model\\nthat also accounts for distortion from transceiver hardware impairments. We\\nthen formulate and solve an optimization task to maximize the average sum rate\\nby adjusting the antenna positions using particle swarm optimization. Finally,\\nthe performance with movable antennas is compared with fixed uniform arrays and\\nthe derived theoretical upper bound. The numerical study concludes that the\\ndata rate improvement from movable antennas over other arrays heavily depends\\non the level of hardware impairments, the richness of the multi-path\\nenvironments, and the number of subcarriers. The present study provides vital\\ninsights into the most suitable use cases for movable antennas in future\\nwideband systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,eess.SP,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T12:20:46Z\"}"}
