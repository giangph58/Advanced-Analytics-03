{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16918v1\", \"title\": \"OptimAI: Optimization from Natural Language Using LLM-Powered AI Agents\", \"summary\": \"Optimization plays a vital role in scientific research and practical\\napplications, but formulating a concrete optimization problem described in\\nnatural language into a mathematical form and selecting a suitable solver to\\nsolve the problem requires substantial domain expertise. We introduce\\n\\\\textbf{OptimAI}, a framework for solving \\\\underline{Optim}ization problems\\ndescribed in natural language by leveraging LLM-powered \\\\underline{AI} agents,\\nachieving superior performance over current state-of-the-art methods. Our\\nframework is built upon four key roles: (1) a \\\\emph{formulator} that translates\\nnatural language problem descriptions into precise mathematical formulations;\\n(2) a \\\\emph{planner} that constructs a high-level solution strategy prior to\\nexecution; and (3) a \\\\emph{coder} and a \\\\emph{code critic} capable of\\ninteracting with the environment and reflecting on outcomes to refine future\\nactions. Ablation studies confirm that all roles are essential; removing the\\nplanner or code critic results in $5.8\\\\times$ and $3.1\\\\times$ drops in\\nproductivity, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce UCB-based debug\\nscheduling to dynamically switch between alternative plans, yielding an\\nadditional $3.3\\\\times$ productivity gain. Our design emphasizes multi-agent\\ncollaboration, allowing us to conveniently explore the synergistic effect of\\ncombining diverse models within a unified system. Our approach attains 88.1\\\\%\\naccuracy on the NLP4LP dataset and 71.2\\\\% on the Optibench (non-linear w/o\\ntable) subset, reducing error rates by 58\\\\% and 50\\\\% respectively over prior\\nbest results.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T17:45:05Z\"}"}
