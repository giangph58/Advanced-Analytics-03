We propose a semidefinite programming upper bound\\nfor the maximum cardinality $\\\\alpha(n, t)$ of such a set based on an extension\\nof the Lov\\\\'asz theta number to hypergraphs. This bound is at least as good as\\npreviously known bounds and for many values of $n$ and $t$ it is better.\\n  We also refine existing spectral methods to show that $\\\\alpha(n, t) \\\\leq\\n2(n+1)$ for all $n$ and $t \\\\leq 0$, with equality only at $t = -1/n$. This\\nallows us to show the uniqueness of the optimal construction at $t = -1/n$ for\\n$n \\\\leq 5$ and to enumerate all possible constructions for $n \\\\leq 3$ and $t\\n\\\\leq 0$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,math.MG,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T11:32:46Z\"}"}
