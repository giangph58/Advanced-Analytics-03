{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05132v1\", \"title\": \"An Active Contour Model for Silhouette Vectorization using B\\u00e9zier\\n  Curves\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we propose an active contour model for silhouette\\nvectorization using cubic B\\\\'ezier curves. Among the end points of the B\\\\'ezier\\ncurves, we distinguish between corner and regular points where the orientation\\nof the tangent vector is prescribed. By minimizing the distance of the B\\\\'ezier\\ncurves to the silhouette boundary, the active contour model optimizes the\\nlocation of the B\\\\'ezier curves end points, the orientation of the tangent\\nvectors in the regular points, and the estimation of the B\\\\'ezier curve\\nparameters. This active contour model can use the silhouette vectorization\\nobtained by any method as an initial guess. The proposed method significantly\\nreduces the average distance between the silhouette boundary and its\\nvectorization obtained by the world-class graphic software Inkscape, Adobe\\nIllustrator, and a curvature-based vectorization method, which we introduce for\\ncomparison. Our method also allows us to impose additional regularity on the\\nB\\\\'ezier curves by reducing their lengths.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GR\", \"categories\": \"cs.GR,cs.CV,math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T11:09:49Z\"}"}
