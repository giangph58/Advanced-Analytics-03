{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20397v1\", \"title\": \"On DR-semigroups satisfying the ample conditions\", \"summary\": \"A DR-semigroup $S$ (also known as a reduced E-semiabundant or reduced\\nE-Fountain semigroup) is here viewed as a semigroup equipped with two unary\\noperations $D,R$ satisfying finitely many equational laws. Examples include\\nDRC-semigroups (hence Ehresmann semigroups), which also satisfy the congruence\\nconditions. The ample conditions on DR-semigroups are studied here and are\\ndefined by the laws $$xD(y)=D(xD(y))x\\\\mbox{ and }R(y)x=xR(R(y)x).$$ Two natural\\npartial orders may be defined on a DR-semigroup and we show that the ample\\nconditions hold if and only if the two orders are equal and the projections\\n(elements of the form $D(x)$) commute with one-another. Restriction semigroups\\nsatisfy the generalized ample conditions, but we give other examples using\\nstrongly order-preserving functions on a quasiordered set as well as so-called\\n``double demonic\\\" composition on binary relations. Following the work of Stein,\\nwe show how to construct a certain partial algebra $C(S)$ from any\\nDR-semigroup, which is a category if $S$ satisfies the congruence conditions,\\nbut is ``almost\\\" a category if the ample conditions hold. We then characterise\\nthe ample conditions in terms of a converse of the condition on $S$ ensuring\\nthat $C(S)$ is a category. Our main result is an ESN-style theorem for\\nDR-semigroups satisfying the ample conditions, based on the $C(S)$\\nconstruction. We also obtain an embedding theorem, generalizing a result for\\nrestriction semigroups due to Lawson.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RA\", \"categories\": \"math.RA,math.CT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T03:39:20Z\"}"}
