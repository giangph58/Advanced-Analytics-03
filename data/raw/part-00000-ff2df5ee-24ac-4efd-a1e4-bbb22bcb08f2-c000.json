{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16769v1\", \"title\": \"Deep photonic reservoir computer for nonlinear equalization of 16-level\\n  quadrature amplitude modulation signals\", \"summary\": \"Photonic reservoir computer (PRC) is a kind of real-time and adaptive\\nrecurrent neural network, where only weights in the readout layer require\\ntraining. PRC is a promising tool to deal with the crucial issue of nonlinear\\nequalization in optical fiber communications. Here we theoretically show a deep\\nPRC for the nonlinear equalization of coherent signals with the format of 16-\\nlevel quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM). The deep PRC consists of\\ncascading injection-locked Fabry-Perot lasers with optical feedback. Both the\\nin-phase component and the quadrature component of the 16-QAM signals are\\nsimultaneously injected into the deep PRC in parallel, based on the wavelength\\nmultiplexing of Fabry-Perot lasers. It is demonstrated that the deep PRC\\nexhibits strong capability for the nonlinearity compensation of coherent\\nsignals. The Q factor is improved by more than 1 dB for 16-QAM signals with\\nlaunch powers above 10 dBm, associated with a bit rate of 240 Gbps and a\\ntransmission distance of 50 km.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T14:41:20Z\"}"}
