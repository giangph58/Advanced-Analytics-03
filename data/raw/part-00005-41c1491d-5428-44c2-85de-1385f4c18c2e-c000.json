For the numerical calculations,\\nwe have adopted the light-front quark model (LFQM). We have studied\\n$\\\\chi_{c0}\\\\rightarrow J{/}\\\\psi+\\\\gamma $ and\\n$\\\\psi(2S)\\\\rightarrow\\\\chi_{c0}+\\\\gamma$, $h_c(1P)\\\\rightarrow\\\\eta_c(1S)+\\\\gamma $,\\nand $\\\\eta_c(2S)\\\\rightarrow h_c(1P)+\\\\gamma $ transitions in this work. We have\\nalso demonstrated the behavior of the transition form factors (TFFs) for the\\n$h_c(1P)\\\\rightarrow\\\\eta_c(1S)+\\\\gamma $ and\\n$\\\\psi(2S)\\\\rightarrow\\\\chi_{c0}+\\\\gamma$ decays in this model. Using the TFFs\\nresults, we have calculated the decay widths and branching ratios for these\\ntransitions. Our numerical results of decay constants, decay widths, and\\nbranching ratios are overall in good agreement with available experimental,\\ntheoretical and lattice simulation data.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T05:22:46Z\"}"}
