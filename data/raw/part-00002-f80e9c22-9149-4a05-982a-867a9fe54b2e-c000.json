Our filtering technique is interesting for decision-making\\npipelines deploying machine learning models in critical sectors, e.g., power\\nsystems, as it offers a conservative data selection and an optimal transport\\ninterpretation. To ensure the scalability of our method, we provide two\\nefficient approximations. The first approximation processes reduced-cardinality\\nrepresentations of the datasets concurrently. The second makes use of a\\ncomputationally light Euclidian distance approximation. Additionally, we open\\nthe first dataset showcasing localized critical peak rebate demand response in\\na northern climate. We present the filtering patterns of our method on\\nsynthetic datasets and numerically benchmark our method for training data\\nselection. Finally, we employ our method as part of a first forecasting\\nbenchmark for our open-source dataset.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T13:07:26Z\"}"}
