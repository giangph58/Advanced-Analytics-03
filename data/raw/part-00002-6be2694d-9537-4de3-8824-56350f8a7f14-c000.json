{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21833v1\", \"title\": \"Non-standard quantum algebras and infinite-dimensional PT-symmetric\\n  systems\", \"summary\": \"In this work, we introduce a PT-symmetric infinite-dimensional representation\\nof the Uz(sl(2,R)) Hopf algebra, and we analyse a multiparametric family of\\nHamiltonians constructed from such representation of the generators of this\\nnon-standard quantum algebra. It is shown that all these Hamiltonians can be\\nmapped to equivalent systems endowed with a position-dependent mass. From the\\nlatter presentation, it is shown how appropriate point canonical\\ntransformations can be further defined in order to transform them into\\nHamiltonians with constant mass over suitable domains. By following this\\napproach, the bound-state spectrum and the corresponding eigenfunctions of the\\ninitial PT-symmetric Hamiltonians can be determined. It is worth stressing that\\na relevant feature of some of the new Uz(sl(2,R)) systems here presented is\\nfound to be their connection with double-well and P\\\\\\\"oschl-Teller potentials.\\nIn fact, as an application we present a particular Hamiltonian that can be\\nexpressed as an effective double-well trigonometric potential, which is\\ncommonly used to model several relevant systems in molecular physics.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-30T17:40:56Z\"}"}
