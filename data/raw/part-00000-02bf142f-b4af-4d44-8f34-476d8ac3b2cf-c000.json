{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12025v1\", \"title\": \"FedEPA: Enhancing Personalization and Modality Alignment in Multimodal\\n  Federated Learning\", \"summary\": \"Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training across multiple\\nparties while preserving privacy. However, most FL systems assume clients hold\\nonly unimodal data, limiting their real-world applicability, as institutions\\noften possess multimodal data. Moreover, the lack of labeled data further\\nconstrains the performance of most FL methods. In this work, we propose FedEPA,\\na novel FL framework for multimodal learning. FedEPA employs a personalized\\nlocal model aggregation strategy that leverages labeled data on clients to\\nlearn personalized aggregation weights, thereby alleviating the impact of data\\nheterogeneity. We also propose an unsupervised modality alignment strategy that\\nworks effectively with limited labeled data. Specifically, we decompose\\nmultimodal features into aligned features and context features. We then employ\\ncontrastive learning to align the aligned features across modalities, ensure\\nthe independence between aligned features and context features within each\\nmodality, and promote the diversity of context features. A multimodal feature\\nfusion strategy is introduced to obtain a joint embedding. The experimental\\nresults show that FedEPA significantly outperforms existing FL methods in\\nmultimodal classification tasks under limited labeled data conditions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T12:32:37Z\"}"}
