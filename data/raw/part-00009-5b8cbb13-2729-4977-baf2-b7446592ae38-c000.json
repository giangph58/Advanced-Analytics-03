Here we carry\\nout a thorough multiconfigurational investigation for two prototypical\\nmolecular qubits based on vanadyl and copper tetra-phenyl porphyrins.\\nState-average CASSCF and NEVPT2 calculations have been employed with four\\ndifferent active spaces of growing complexity to account for the d-d, second\\nd-shell, ligand-to-metal charge transfer states and $\\\\pi-\\\\pi^*$ excited states,\\nrevealing an in-depth picture of low-lying excited states in agreement with\\nexperimental observations. The largest active spaces attempted, (13,14) for the\\nvanadyl and (17,12) for the copper compounds, reveal that the lowest-lying\\nexcited states originate from $\\\\pi-\\\\pi^*$ quartet excitations. These findings\\nshed light on the nature of the excited states of molecular qubits, taking an\\nimportant step toward elucidating their role in molecular spin dynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:59:23Z\"}"}
