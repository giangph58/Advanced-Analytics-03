{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03625v1\", \"title\": \"Numerical Reconstruction and Analysis of Backward Semilinear\\n  Subdiffusion Problems\", \"summary\": \"This paper aims to develop and analyze a numerical scheme for solving the\\nbackward problem of semilinear subdiffusion equations. We establish the\\nexistence, uniqueness, and conditional stability of the solution to the inverse\\nproblem by applying the smoothing and asymptotic properties of solution\\noperators and constructing a fixed-point iteration. This derived conditional\\nstability further inspires a numerical reconstruction scheme. To address the\\nmildly ill-posed nature of the problem, we employ the quasi-boundary value\\nmethod for regularization. A fully discrete scheme is proposed, utilizing the\\nfinite element method for spatial discretization and convolution quadrature for\\ntemporal discretization. A thorough error analysis of the resulting discrete\\nsystem is provided for both smooth and nonsmooth data. This analysis relies on\\nthe smoothing properties of discrete solution operators, some nonstandard error\\nestimates optimal with respect to data regularity in the direct problem, and\\nthe arguments used in stability analysis. The derived a priori error estimate\\noffers guidance for selecting the regularization parameter and discretization\\nparameters based on the noise level. Moreover, we propose an easy-to-implement\\niterative algorithm for solving the fully discrete scheme and prove its linear\\nconvergence. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the theoretical\\nestimates and demonstrate the necessity of the assumption required in the\\nanalysis.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T15:22:31Z\"}"}
