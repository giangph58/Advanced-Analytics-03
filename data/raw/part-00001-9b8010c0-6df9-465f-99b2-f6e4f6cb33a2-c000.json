{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20400v1\", \"title\": \"Evolution of Gaussians in the Hellinger-Kantorovich-Boltzmann gradient\\n  flow\", \"summary\": \"This study leverages the basic insight that the gradient-flow equation\\nassociated with the relative Boltzmann entropy, in relation to a Gaussian\\nreference measure within the Hellinger-Kantorovich (HK) geometry, preserves the\\nclass of Gaussian measures. This invariance serves as the foundation for\\nconstructing a reduced gradient structure on the parameter space characterizing\\nGaussian densities. We derive explicit ordinary differential equations that\\ngovern the evolution of mean, covariance, and mass under the HK-Boltzmann\\ngradient flow. The reduced structure retains the additive form of the HK\\nmetric, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of the dynamics involved.\\n  We explore the geodesic convexity of the reduced system, revealing that\\nglobal convexity is confined to the pure transport scenario, while a variant of\\nsublevel semi-convexity is observed in the general case. Furthermore, we\\ndemonstrate exponential convergence to equilibrium through\\nPolyak-Lojasiewicz-type inequalities, applicable both globally and on sublevel\\nsets. By monitoring the evolution of covariance eigenvalues, we refine the\\ndecay rates associated with convergence. Additionally, we extend our analysis\\nto non-Gaussian targets exhibiting strong log-lambda-concavity, corroborating\\nour theoretical results with numerical experiments that encompass a\\nGaussian-target gradient flow and a Bayesian logistic regression application.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math.PR,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T03:54:56Z\"}"}
