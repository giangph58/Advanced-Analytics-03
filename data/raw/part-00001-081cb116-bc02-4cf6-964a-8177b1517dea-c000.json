Increasing\\nurbanization rate causes an urban heat island (UHI) effect, which strongly\\ndepends on the short- and long-wave radiation balance heat flux between the\\nsurfaces. In order to calculate accurately this heat flux, it is required to\\nassess the surface temperature which depends on the knowledge of the thermal\\nproperties and the surface heat transfer coefficients in the heat transfer\\nproblem. The aim of this paper is to estimate the thermal properties of the\\nground and the time varying surface heat transfer coefficient by solving an\\ninverse problem. The Dufort--Frankel scheme is applied for solving the unsteady\\nheat transfer problem. For the inverse problem, a Markov chain Monte Carlo\\nmethod is used to estimate the posterior probability density function of\\nunknown parameters within the Bayesian framework of statistics, by applying the\\nMetropolis-Hastings algorithm for random sample generation. Actual temperature\\nmeasurements available at different ground depths were used for the solution of\\nthe inverse problem. Different time discretizations were examined for the\\ntransient heat transfer coefficient at the ground surface, which then involved\\ndifferent prior distributions. Results of different case studies show that the\\nestimated values of the unknown parameters were in accordance with literature\\nvalues. Moreover, with the present solution of the inverse problem the\\ntemperature residuals were smaller than those obtained by using literature\\nvalues for the unknowns.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CE\", \"categories\": \"cs.CE,math-ph,math.MP,G.3\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:29:25Z\"}"}
