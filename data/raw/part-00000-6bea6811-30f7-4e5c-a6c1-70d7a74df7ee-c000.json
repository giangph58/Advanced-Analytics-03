By tuning the plate angle $\\\\theta$, we achieve\\nprecise control over pulse multiplicity and repetition rates in orthogonal\\nTE/TM modes. For the TE mode, increasing $\\\\theta$ transitions the system from\\nlow amplitude and disordered quasi-periodic states to fundamental\\n(single-pulse) mode locking and harmonic dual-pulse regimes. Polarization\\nresolved measurements and cross-correlation analyses reveal\\npolarization-mediated dynamics, achieving coherent pulse alignment at half the\\ncavity roundtrip time. This work establishes orthogonal polarization feedback\\nas a compact, versatile mechanism for tailoring ultrafast pulse trains,\\nenabling applications in polarization-multiplexed communications, dual-comb\\nspectroscopy, and high-repetition-rate photonic systems.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-16T10:55:08Z\"}"}
