{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05839v1\", \"title\": \"Accurate Decomposition of Galaxies with Spiral Arms: Dust Properties and\\n  Distribution\", \"summary\": \"We analyze three nearby spiral galaxies - NGC 1097, NGC 1566, and NGC 3627 -\\nusing images from the DustPedia database in seven infrared bands (3.6, 8, 24,\\n70, 100, 160, and 250 micron). For each image, we perform photometric\\ndecomposition and construct a multi-component model, including a detailed\\nrepresentation of the spiral arms. Our results show that the light distribution\\nis well described by an exponential disk and a Sersic bulge when\\nnon-axisymmetric components are properly taken into account. We test the\\npredictions of the stationary density wave theory using the derived models in\\nbands, tracing both old stars and recent star formation. Our findings suggest\\nthat the spiral arms in all three galaxies are unlikely to originate from\\nstationary density waves. Additionally, we perform spectral energy distribution\\n(SED) modeling using the hierarchical Bayesian code HerBIE, fitting individual\\ncomponents to derive dust properties. We find that spiral arms contain a\\nsignificant (>10%) fraction of cold dust, with an average temperature of\\napproximately 18-20 K. The estimated fraction of polycyclic aromatic\\nhydrocarbons (PAHs) declines significantly toward the galactic center but\\nremains similar between the arm and interarm regions.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:21:12Z\"}"}
