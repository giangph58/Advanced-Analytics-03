Many real-world graphs are separable such as\\ngraphs of bounded genus, graphs of constant treewidth, and graphs excluding a\\nfixed minor $H$. In particular, the well-known planar graphs are separable. We\\npresent a succinct encoding of separable graphs $G$ such that any number of\\ndepth-first searches DFS can be performed, from any given start vertex, each in\\n$o(n)$ time with $o(n)$ additional bits. After the execution of a DFS, the\\nsuccinct encoding of $G$ is augmented such that the DFS tree is encoded inside\\nthe encoding. Afterward, the encoding provides common DFS-related queries in\\nconstant time. These queries include queries such as lowest-common ancestor of\\ntwo given vertices in the DFS tree or queries that output the lowpoint of a\\ngiven vertex in the DFS tree. Furthermore, for planar graphs, we show that the\\nsuccinct encoding can be computed in $O(n)$ bits and expected linear time, and\\na compact variant can be constructed in $O(n)$ time and bits.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T07:52:22Z\"}"}
