Motivated by this, we study fundamental\\nproperties of long-range spin systems in thermal equilibrium, focusing on the\\nweak regime of $ \\\\alpha>D$. Our main result is a proof of analiticity of their\\npartition functions at high temperatures, which allows us to construct a\\nclassical algorithm with sub-exponential runtime\\n$\\\\exp(\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\log^2(N/\\\\epsilon)))$ that approximates the log-partition\\nfunction to small additive error $\\\\epsilon$. As by-products, we establish the\\nequivalence of ensembles and the Gaussianity of the density of states, which we\\nverify numerically in both the weak and strong long-range regimes. This also\\nyields constraints on the appearance of various classes of phase transitions,\\nincluding thermal, dynamical and excited-state ones. Our main technical\\ncontribution is the extension to the quantum long-range regime of the\\nconvergence criterion for cluster expansions of Koteck\\\\'y and Preiss.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T16:17:45Z\"}"}
