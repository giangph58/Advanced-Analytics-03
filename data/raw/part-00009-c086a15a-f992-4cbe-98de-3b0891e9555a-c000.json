Using these finite-component\\ncovers and the associated functional, we introduce and investigate a\\nvariational notion of uniformly star superparacompact subsets in metric spaces\\nin the spirit of studies on uniformly paracompact subset and UC-subset. We show\\nthat the collection of all such subsets forms a bornology with a closed base,\\nwhich is contained in the bornology of uniformly paracompact subsets.\\nConditions under which these two bornologies coincide are specified.\\nFurthermore, we provide several new characterizations of uniformly star\\nsuperparacompact metric spaces also known as cofinally Bourbaki-quasi complete\\nspaces in terms of some geometric functionals. As a consequence, we establish\\nnew relationships among metric spaces that lie between compactness and\\ncompleteness.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GN\", \"categories\": \"math.GN,math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-05-01T12:46:44Z\"}"}
