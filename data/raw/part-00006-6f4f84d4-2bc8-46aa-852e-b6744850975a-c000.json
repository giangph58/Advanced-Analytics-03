{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02775v1\", \"title\": \"TailedCore: Few-Shot Sampling for Unsupervised Long-Tail Noisy Anomaly\\n  Detection\", \"summary\": \"We aim to solve unsupervised anomaly detection in a practical challenging\\nenvironment where the normal dataset is both contaminated with defective\\nregions and its product class distribution is tailed but unknown. We observe\\nthat existing models suffer from tail-versus-noise trade-off where if a model\\nis robust against pixel noise, then its performance deteriorates on tail class\\nsamples, and vice versa. To mitigate the issue, we handle the tail class and\\nnoise samples independently. To this end, we propose TailSampler, a novel class\\nsize predictor that estimates the class cardinality of samples based on a\\nsymmetric assumption on the class-wise distribution of embedding similarities.\\nTailSampler can be utilized to sample the tail class samples exclusively,\\nallowing to handle them separately. Based on these facets, we build a\\nmemory-based anomaly detection model TailedCore, whose memory both well\\ncaptures tail class information and is noise-robust. We extensively validate\\nthe effectiveness of TailedCore on the unsupervised long-tail noisy anomaly\\ndetection setting, and show that TailedCore outperforms the state-of-the-art in\\nmost settings.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T17:14:57Z\"}"}
