In this paper, we study creativity\\nfrom a practical perspective and introduce quantitative measures that help the\\nuser to choose a suitable AI model for a given task. We evaluated our measures\\non a number of popular image-to-image generation models, and the results of\\nthis suggest that our measures conform to human intuition.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T15:20:17Z\"}"}
