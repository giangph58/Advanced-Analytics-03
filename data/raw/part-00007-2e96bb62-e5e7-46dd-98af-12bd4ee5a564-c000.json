{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20663v1\", \"title\": \"Reconnection nanojets in an erupting solar filament with unprecedented\\n  high speeds\", \"summary\": \"Solar nanojets are small-scale jets generated by component magnetic\\nreconnection, characterized by collimated plasma motion perpendicular to the\\nreconnecting magnetic field lines. As an indicator of nanoflare events, they\\nare believed to play a significant role in coronal heating. Using\\nhigh-resolution extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) imaging observations from the Extreme\\nUltraviolet Imager (EUI) onboard the Solar Orbiter mission, we identified 27\\nnanojets in an erupting filament on September 30, 2024. They are potentially\\nassociated with the untwisting of magnetic field lines of the filament. Most\\nnanojets exhibit velocities around 450 km s$^{-1}$, with the fastest reaching\\napproximately 800 km s$^{-1}$, significantly higher than previously reported\\nbut comparable to the typical coronal Alfv\\\\'en speed. To our knowledge, these\\nare the highest speeds ever reported for small-scale jets (less than ~1 Mm\\nwide) in the solar atmosphere. Our findings suggest that these nanoflare-type\\nphenomena can be more dynamic than previously recognized and may contribute to\\nthe energy release process of solar eruptions and the heating of coronal active\\nregions.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T11:37:55Z\"}"}
