{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12762v1\", \"title\": \"Testing the Star-disk Collision Model for Quasi-periodic Eruptions\", \"summary\": \"Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), the repeated outbursts observed in soft\\nX-ray bands, have attracted broad interest, but their physical origin is under\\ndebate. One of the popular models, the star-disk collision model, suggests that\\nQPEs can be produced through periodic collisions of an orbiting star with the\\naccretion disk of a central black hole (BH). However, previous tests of the\\nstar-disk collision model mainly focus on the timing analysis. Other observed\\nproperties, such as peak luminosities $L_{\\\\rm{p}}$, durations $t_{\\\\rm{e}}$, and\\nradiation temperatures $T_{\\\\rm{p}}$ of the eruptions, are not systematically\\ninvestigated. For a sample of six QPE sources and two QPE-like sources, we test\\nthe star-disk collision model by using these observables to derive the\\nconstraints on the stellar radius $R_*$. We find that, except for two sources\\n(eRo-QPE3 and eRo-QPE4), the rest of the sample either has no allowed $R_*$ to\\nsimultaneously reproduce the observed $L_{\\\\rm{p}}$ and $t_{\\\\rm{e}}$, or the\\nrequired $R_*$ is too large to avoid being disrupted by the central BH. For the\\ntwo exceptions, a stellar radius of the order of $1\\\\ R_{\\\\rm{\\\\odot}}$ is\\nnecessary to satisfy all the constraints. Another issue with the simplest\\nversion of this model is that it predicts $k T_{\\\\rm{p}} \\\\sim 10\\\\ \\\\rm{eV}$, one\\norder of magnitude lower than the observed value.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.SR,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-17T09:00:00Z\"}"}
