{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20010v1\", \"title\": \"Towards Automated Scoping of AI for Social Good Projects\", \"summary\": \"Artificial Intelligence for Social Good (AI4SG) is an emerging effort that\\naims to address complex societal challenges with the powerful capabilities of\\nAI systems. These challenges range from local issues with transit networks to\\nglobal wildlife preservation. However, regardless of scale, a critical\\nbottleneck for many AI4SG initiatives is the laborious process of problem\\nscoping -- a complex and resource-intensive task -- due to a scarcity of\\nprofessionals with both technical and domain expertise. Given the remarkable\\napplications of large language models (LLM), we propose a Problem Scoping Agent\\n(PSA) that uses an LLM to generate comprehensive project proposals grounded in\\nscientific literature and real-world knowledge. We demonstrate that our PSA\\nframework generates proposals comparable to those written by experts through a\\nblind review and AI evaluations. Finally, we document the challenges of\\nreal-world problem scoping and note several areas for future work.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:29:51Z\"}"}
