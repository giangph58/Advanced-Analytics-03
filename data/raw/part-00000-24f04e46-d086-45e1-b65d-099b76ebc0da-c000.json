{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20024v1\", \"title\": \"SpatialReasoner: Towards Explicit and Generalizable 3D Spatial Reasoning\", \"summary\": \"Recent studies in 3D spatial reasoning explore data-driven approaches and\\nachieve enhanced spatial reasoning performance with reinforcement learning\\n(RL). However, these methods typically perform spatial reasoning in an implicit\\nmanner, and it remains underexplored whether the acquired 3D knowledge\\ngeneralizes to unseen question types at any stage of the training. In this work\\nwe introduce SpatialReasoner, a novel large vision-language model (LVLM) that\\naddress 3D spatial reasoning with explicit 3D representations shared between\\nstages -- 3D perception, computation, and reasoning. Explicit 3D\\nrepresentations provide a coherent interface that supports advanced 3D spatial\\nreasoning and enable us to study the factual errors made by LVLMs. Results show\\nthat our SpatialReasoner achieve improved performance on a variety of spatial\\nreasoning benchmarks and generalizes better when evaluating on novel 3D spatial\\nreasoning questions. Our study bridges the 3D parsing capabilities of prior\\nvisual foundation models with the powerful reasoning abilities of large\\nlanguage models, opening new directions for 3D spatial reasoning.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T17:48:43Z\"}"}
