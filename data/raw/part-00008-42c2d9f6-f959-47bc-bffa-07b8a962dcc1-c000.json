We employed the Weighted Wavelet\\nZ-transform (WWZ) and Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP) methods for our analysis.\\nQPO signals with frequencies of 5.91 $\\\\times 10^{-4}$ Hz and 5.68 $\\\\times\\n10^{-4}$ Hz were detected in observations conducted by Chandra (ObsID 7830) in\\n2007 and XMM-Newton (ObsID 0761670301) in 2015, with confidence levels of 3.7\\n$\\\\sigma$ and 3.3 $\\\\sigma$, respectively. These signals are the first to be\\nindependently observed by two different telescopes over an eight-year period\\nwith closely matched frequencies. Most notably, the combined confidence level\\nof the QPO signals from these two independent observations reaches an\\nexceptional 5.2 $\\\\sigma$, which is rare in astrophysical research and\\nsignificantly strengthens our conviction in the authenticity of these signals.\\nA detailed analysis of the observational data suggests that these QPO signals\\nmay be correlated with the properties of the central supermassive black hole.\\nAdditionally, spectral analysis of the observational data revealed no\\nsignificant spectral differences between the QPO and non-QPO segments. These\\nfindings provide new insights into the X-ray variability mechanisms of the\\ncentral black hole in NGC 4151 and offer a novel perspective for black hole\\nmass estimation.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T10:55:37Z\"}"}
