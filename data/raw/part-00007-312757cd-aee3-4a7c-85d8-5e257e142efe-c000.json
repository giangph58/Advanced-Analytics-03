To address limitations arising from spatial domain feature\\nfusion and insufficient receptive fields, this paper introduces SAIP-Net, a\\nnovel frequency-aware segmentation framework that leverages Spectral Adaptive\\nInformation Propagation. SAIP-Net employs adaptive frequency filtering and\\nmulti-scale receptive field enhancement to effectively suppress intra-class\\nfeature inconsistencies and sharpen boundary lines. Comprehensive experiments\\ndemonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods,\\nhighlighting the effectiveness of spectral-adaptive strategies combined with\\nexpanded receptive fields for remote sensing image segmentation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-23T09:43:58Z\"}"}
