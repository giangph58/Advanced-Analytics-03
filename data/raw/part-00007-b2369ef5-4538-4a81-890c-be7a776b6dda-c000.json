Recently, the\\nquantum Wasserstein distance emerged from the theory of quantum optimal\\ntransport as a promising tool in this context. Here we show on general grounds\\nthat the quantum Wasserstein distance between two ground states of a quantum\\ncritical system exhibits critical scaling. We demonstrate this explicitly using\\nknown closed analytical expressions for the magnetic correlations in the\\ntransverse field Ising model, to numerically extract the critical exponents for\\nthe distance close to the quantum critical point, confirming our analytical\\nderivation. Our results have implications for learning of ground states of\\nquantum critical phases of matter.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:47:56Z\"}"}
