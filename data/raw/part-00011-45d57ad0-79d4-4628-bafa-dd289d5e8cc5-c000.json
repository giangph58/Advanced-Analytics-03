While hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is the current benchmark\\ndielectric, exploration of the most suitable dielectric materials covering the\\ncomplete substrates continues to expand. This work demonstrates the formation\\nof high optical-quality excitons in two widely explored layered semiconductors,\\nWSe$_2$ and WS$_2$, integrated into polyimide (PI) thin films of thicknesses\\n$\\\\approx$500 nm. The photoluminescence (PL) studies at $T$ = 296 K show the\\nformation of neutral excitons $\\\\left(X^0\\\\right)$ and trions in\\nfully-PI-encapsulated 1L-WSe$_2$ with 2-sigma ($2\\\\sigma$) spatial-inhomogeneity\\nof 4.5 (3.4) meV in $X^0$ emission energy (linewidth), which is $\\\\approx$1/3rd\\n(1/5th), respectively, that of inhomogeneity measured in fully-hBN-encapsulated\\n1L-WSe$_2$. A smaller $2\\\\sigma$ of 2.1 (2.3) meV in $X^0$ emission energy\\n(linewidth) has been shown for fully-PI-encapsulated 1L-WS$_2$.\\nPolarization-resolved and excitation power-dependent PL measurements of\\nPI-isolated 1L-TMDs at $T$ = 4 K further reveal formations of high-quality\\nneutral-biexcitons and negatively-charged biexcitons, with degrees of\\nvalley-polarization up to 21$\\\\%$ under non-resonant excitation. Furthermore,\\nthe fully-PI-encapsulated 1L-WSe$_2$ also hosts single quantum emitters with\\nnarrow linewidths and high-spectral stability. This work indicates that PI thin\\nfilms may serve the purpose of high-quality dielectric material for integrating\\nthe layered materials on a wafer scale.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.app-ph,physics.optics,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-21T09:29:43Z\"}"}
