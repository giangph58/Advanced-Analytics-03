Although\\nthis standard practice often gives relatively good agreement with experimental\\ndata, it contradicts one of the basic assumptions of quantum mechanics,\\npostulating the impossibility of direct observation of the wavefunction, i.e.,\\nindividual molecular orbitals. The scanning probe community often considers\\nthis contradiction about observing molecular orbitals as a philosophical\\nquestion rather than a genuine problem. Moreover, in the case of polyradical\\nstrongly correlated molecules, the interpretation of STS maps based on\\none-electron molecular orbitals often fails. Thus, for a precise interpretation\\nof STS maps and their connection to the electronic structure of molecules, a\\ntheoretical description, including non-equilibrium tunneling processes going\\nbeyond one-electron process, is required. In this contribution, we first show\\nwhy, in selected cases, it is possible to achieve good agreement with\\nexperimental data based on one-electron canonical molecular orbitals and\\nTersoff-Hamann approximation. Next, we will show that for an accurate\\ninterpretation of strongly correlated molecules, it is necessary to describe\\nthe process of removing/adding an electron within the formalism of\\nmany-electron wavefunctions for the neutral and charged states. This can be\\naccomplished by the concept of so-called Dyson orbitals.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T10:45:59Z\"}"}
