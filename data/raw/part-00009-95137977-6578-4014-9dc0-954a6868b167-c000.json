{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03210v1\", \"title\": \"Weighted Birkhoff averages: Deterministic and probabilistic perspectives\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we present physically related applications of a class of\\nweighted quasi-Monte Carlo methods from a deterministic perspective, and\\nestablish quantitative universal rapid convergence results via various\\nregularity assumptions. Specifically, we introduce weighting with compact\\nsupport to the Birkhoff ergodic averages of quasi-periodic, almost periodic,\\nand periodic systems, thereby achieving universal rapid convergence, including\\nboth arbitrary polynomial and exponential types. This is in stark contrast to\\nthe typically slow convergence in classical ergodic theory. These results, as\\nnew contributions, not only discuss more general weighting functions but also\\nprovide quantitative improvements to existing results, and the explicit\\nregularity settings facilitate the application of these methods to specific\\nproblems. We also revisit the physically related problems and, for the first\\ntime, establish universal exponential convergence results for the weighted\\ncomputation of Fourier coefficients, in both finite-dimensional and\\ninfinite-dimensional cases. In addition to the above, we explore results from a\\nprobabilistic perspective, including the weighted strong law of large numbers\\nand the weighted central limit theorem, by building upon the historical\\nresults.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-05-06T05:58:01Z\"}"}
