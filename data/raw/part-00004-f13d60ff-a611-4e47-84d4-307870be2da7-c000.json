We examine time-delayed\\ndifferential equations, discussing first-order and fractional Caputo\\ntime-delayed differential equations. We derive their characteristic equations\\nand solve them using the Laplace transform. We derive a modified evolution\\nequation for the Hubble parameter incorporating a viscosity term modeled as a\\nfunction of the delayed Hubble parameter within Eckart's theory. We extend this\\nequation using the last-step method of fractional calculus, resulting in\\nCaputo's time-delayed fractional differential equation. This equation accounts\\nfor the finite response times of cosmic fluids, resulting in a comprehensive\\nmodel of the Universe's behavior. We then solve this equation analytically. Due\\nto the complexity of the analytical solution, we also provide a numerical\\nrepresentation. Our solution reaches the de Sitter equilibrium point.\\nAdditionally, we present some generalizations.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T06:00:21Z\"}"}
