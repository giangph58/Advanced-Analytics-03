The characteristic polynomial of $\\\\rho$ is defined as\\n  \\\\begin{equation*}\\n  d(S,\\\\rho)=\\\\det[x_0I+x_1\\\\rho(s_1)+\\\\cdots+x_n\\\\rho(s_n)],\\n  \\\\end{equation*}\\n  where $I$ is the identity operator. In this paper, we show the existence of a\\ncombinatorics structure within $W$, and thereby prove that for any two complex\\nfinite dimensional representations $\\\\rho_1$ and $\\\\rho_2$ of $W$,\\n$d(S,\\\\rho_1)=d(S,\\\\rho_2)$ if and only if $\\\\rho_1 \\\\cong \\\\rho_2$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RT\", \"categories\": \"math.RT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T04:14:17Z\"}"}
