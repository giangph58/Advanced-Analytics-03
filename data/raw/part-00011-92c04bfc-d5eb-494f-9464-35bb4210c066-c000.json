By using the moving frame, we can define Bertrand framed surfaces as the\\nsame idea as Bertrand framed curves. Then we find the caustics and involutes as\\nBertrand framed surfaces. As applications, we can directly define the caustics\\nand involutes of framed surfaces, and give conditions that the caustics and\\ninvolutes are inverse operations of framed surfaces like as those of Legendre\\ncurves. Moreover, a framed surface is one of the Bertrand framed surfaces if\\nand only if another caustic of the involute exists, under conditions.\\nFurthermore, we find a new such operation, the so-called tangential direction\\nframed surfaces.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-05-07T04:43:38Z\"}"}
