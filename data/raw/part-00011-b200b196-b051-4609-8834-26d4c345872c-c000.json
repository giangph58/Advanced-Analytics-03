{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19751v1\", \"title\": \"On the Relation Between Treewidth, Tree-Independence Number, and\\n  Tree-Chromatic Number of Graphs\", \"summary\": \"We investigate two recently introduced graph parameters, both of which\\nmeasure the complexity of the tree decompositions of a given graph. Recall that\\nthe treewidth $\\\\tw(G)$ of a graph $G$ measures the largest number of vertices\\nrequired in a bag of every tree decomposition of $G$. Similarly, the\\ntree-independence number $\\\\tree-alpha(G)$ and the tree-chromatic number\\n$\\\\tree-chi(G)$ measure the largest independence number, respectively the\\nlargest chromatic number, required in a bag of every tree decomposition of $G$.\\n  Recently, Dallard, Milani\\\\v{c}, and \\\\v{S}torgel asked (JCTB, 2024) whether\\nfor all graphs $G$ it holds that $\\\\tw(G)+1 \\\\leq \\\\tree-alpha(G) \\\\cdot\\n\\\\tree-chi(G)$. We answer that question in the negative, providing examples $G$\\nwhere $\\\\tw(G)$ is roughly $2\\\\cdot \\\\tree-alpha(G) \\\\cdot \\\\tree-chi(G)$.\\n  For our approach we introduce $H$-subdivisions of $G$, which may be of\\nindependent interest, and give sharp bounds on the treewidth, tree-independence\\nnumber, and tree-chromatic number of such graphs. Additionally, we give upper\\nbounds on treewidth in terms of tree-independence number and tree-chromatic\\nnumber that hold for all graphs $G$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-28T12:51:07Z\"}"}
