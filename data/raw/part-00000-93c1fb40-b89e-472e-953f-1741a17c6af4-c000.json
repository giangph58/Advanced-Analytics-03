Nowadays, X-ray time-resolved tomography, or tomoscopy, is a\\nleading technique for in-situ and operando 4D (3D+time) characterization.\\nDespite its ability to achieve 1000 tomograms per second at large-scale X-ray\\nfacilities, its applicability is limited by the centrifugal forces exerted on\\nsamples and the challenges of developing suitable environments for such\\nhigh-speed studies. Here, we introduce STRT, an approach that has the potential\\nto enhance the temporal resolution of tomoscopy by at least an order of\\nmagnitude while preserving spatial resolution. STRT exploits a 4D DL\\nreconstruction algorithm to produce high-fidelity 3D reconstructions at each\\ntime point, retrieved from a significantly reduced angular range of a few\\ndegrees compared to the 0-180 degrees of traditional tomoscopy. Thus, STRT\\nenhances the temporal resolution compared to tomoscopy by a factor equal to the\\nratio between 180 degrees and the angular ranges used by STRT. In this work, we\\nvalidate the 4D capabilities of STRT through simulations and experiments on\\ndroplet collision simulations and additive manufacturing processes. We\\nanticipate that STRT will significantly expand the capabilities of 4D X-ray\\nimaging, enabling previously unattainable studies in both academic and\\nindustrial contexts, such as materials formation and mechanical testing.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-15T12:49:19Z\"}"}
