They have been established as a\\nuseful tool for analyzing non-Markovian open quantum dynamics based on the\\nability to control the environmental memory through simple feedback mechanisms.\\nIn this work, we investigate how ancilla-ancilla entanglement can serve as a\\nmechanism for controlling the non-Markovianity of an open system, focusing on\\nan operational approach to generating correlations within the environment. To\\nthis end, we first demonstrate that the open dynamics of CMs with sequentially\\ngenerated correlations between groups of ancillas can be mapped onto a\\ncomposite CM, where the memory part of the environment is incorporated into an\\nenlarged Markovian system. We then apply this framework to an all-qubit CM, and\\nshow that non-Markovian behavior emerges only when the next incoming pair of\\nancillas are entangled prior to colliding with the system. On the other hand,\\nwhen system-ancilla collisions precede ancilla-ancilla entanglement, we find\\nthe open dynamics to always be Markovian. Our findings highlight how certain\\nqualitative features of inter-ancilla correlations can strongly influence the\\nonset of system non-Markovianity.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-05-08T17:22:42Z\"}"}
