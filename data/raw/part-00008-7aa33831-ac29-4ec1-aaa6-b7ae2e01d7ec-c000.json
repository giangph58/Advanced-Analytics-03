{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17747v1\", \"title\": \"Fourier Acceleration in a Linear Sigma Model with Spontaneous Symmetry\\n  Breaking\", \"summary\": \"Fourier acceleration is a technique used in Hybrid Monte Carlo simulations to\\ndecrease the autocorrelation between subsequent field configurations in the\\ngenerated ensemble. It has been shown, in the perturbative limit, to eliminate\\nthe problem of critical slowing down in a $\\\\phi^4$ theory (arXiv:1812.05281\\n[hep-lat]). As a result, there are several techniques that are being explored\\nto generalize Fourier acceleration to work with non-Abelian gauge theories like\\nQCD (arXiv:2112.04556 [hep-lat], arXiv:2108.05486 [hep-lat]). It is hoped that\\nthese methods will prove effective at overcoming the problem of critical\\nslowing down, even in the non-perturbative limit. In our work, we show that\\nFourier acceleration can be applied effectively to a linear sigma model in the\\nsymmetry broken phase, leading to reduced autocorrelation and faster\\nthermalization. We present an algorithm for estimating the optimal Fourier\\nacceleration masses dynamically, based on the lattice data. In the future, we\\nhope to explore the effectiveness of these techniques in the\\nstrongly-interacting case. Since our $\\\\phi^4$ theory is a linear chiral\\neffective theory for QCD, this could be interesting for those who are seeking\\nto generalize Fourier acceleration to QCD.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-lat\", \"categories\": \"hep-lat\", \"published\": \"2025-04-24T17:07:44Z\"}"}
