To obtain a relational (i.e., lifted) representation, the\\nAdvanced Colour Passing (ACP) algorithm is the state of the art. The ACP\\nalgorithm, however, requires underlying distributions, encoded as\\npotential-based factorisations, to exactly match to identify and exploit\\nindistinguishabilities. Hence, ACP is unsuitable for practical applications\\nwhere potentials learned from data inevitably deviate even if associated\\nobjects are indistinguishable. To mitigate this problem, we introduce the\\n$\\\\varepsilon$-Advanced Colour Passing ($\\\\varepsilon$-ACP) algorithm, which\\nallows for a deviation of potentials depending on a hyperparameter\\n$\\\\varepsilon$. $\\\\varepsilon$-ACP efficiently uncovers and exploits\\nindistinguishabilities that are not exact. We prove that the approximation\\nerror induced by $\\\\varepsilon$-ACP is strictly bounded and our experiments show\\nthat the approximation error is close to zero in practice.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.DS,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T14:01:10Z\"}"}
