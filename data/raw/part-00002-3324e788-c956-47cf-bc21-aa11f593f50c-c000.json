Let\\n$V = \\\\{ v_1, \\\\ldots, v_n \\\\} \\\\subset \\\\mathbf{R}^{r}$ be a vector configuration\\nin general position, and let $\\\\mathcal{A}(V)$ be polar dual arrangement of\\nhemispheres in the $d$-dimensional unit sphere $S^d$, where $d=r-1$. For $0\\\\leq\\ns \\\\leq d$ and $0 \\\\leq t \\\\leq n$, let $f_{s,t}(V)$ denote the number of faces of\\n\\\\emph{level} $t$ and dimension $d-s$ in the arrangement $\\\\mathcal{A}(V)$ (these\\ncorrespond to partitions $V=V_-\\\\sqcup V_0 \\\\sqcup V_+$ by linear hyperplanes\\nwith $|V_0|=s$ and $|V_-|=t$). We call the matrix $f(V):=[f_{s,t}(V)]$ the\\n\\\\emph{$f$-matrix} of $V$.\\n  Completing a long line of research on linear relations between face numbers\\nof levels in arrangements, we determine, for every $n\\\\geq r \\\\geq 1$, the affine\\nspace $\\\\mathfrak{F}_{n,r}$ spanned by the $f$-matrices of configurations of $n$\\nvectors in general position in $\\\\mathbf{R}^r$; moreover, we determine the\\nsubspace $\\\\mathfrak{F}^0_{n,r} \\\\subset \\\\mathfrak{F}_{n,r}$ spanned by all\\n\\\\emph{pointed} vector configurations (i.e., such that $V$ is contained in some\\nopen linear halfspace), which correspond to point sets in $\\\\mathbf{R}^d$. This\\ngeneralizes the classical fact that the Dehn--Sommerville relations generate\\nall linear relations between the face numbers of simple polytopes (the faces at\\nlevel $0$) and answers a question posed by Andrzejak and Welzl in 2003.\\n  The key notion for the statements and the proofs of our results is the\\n$g$-matrix of a vector configuration, which determines the $f$-matrix and\\ngeneralizes the classical $g$-vector of a polytope.\\n  By Gale duality, we also obtain analogous results for partitions of vector\\nconfigurations by sign patterns of nontrivial linear dependencies, and for\\n\\\\emph{Radon partitions} of point sets in $\\\\mathbf{R}^d$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,cs.CG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T13:48:10Z\"}"}
