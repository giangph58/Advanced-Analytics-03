{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20738v1\", \"title\": \"EDD-NSTE: Edge Data Distribution as a Network Steiner Tree Estimation in\\n  Edge Computing\", \"summary\": \"Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation\\nand data storage closer to the user's geographical location to improve response\\ntimes and save bandwidth. It also helps to power a variety of applications\\nrequiring low latency. These application data hosted on the cloud needs to be\\ntransferred to the respective edge servers in a specific area to help provide\\nlow-latency app functionalities to the users of that area. Meanwhile, these\\narbitrary heavy data transactions from the cloud to the edge servers result in\\nhigh cost and time penalties. Thus, we need an application data distribution\\nstrategy that minimizes these penalties within the app vendors' specific\\nlatency constraint. In this work, we provide a refined formulation of an\\noptimal approach to solve this Edge Data Distribution (EDD) problem using\\nInteger Programming (IP) technique. Due to the time complexity limitation of\\nthe IP approach, we suggest an O(k) approximation algorithm based on network\\nSteiner tree estimation (EDD-NSTE) for estimating solutions to dense,\\nlarge-scale EDD problems. Integer Programming and EDD-NSTE are evaluated on a\\nstandard real-world EUA data set and the result demonstrates that EDD-NSTE\\nsignificantly outperforms with a performance margin of 86.67% over the other\\nthree representative approaches and the state-of-the-art approach.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T13:21:27Z\"}"}
