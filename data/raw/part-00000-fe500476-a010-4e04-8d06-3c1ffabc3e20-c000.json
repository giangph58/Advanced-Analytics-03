{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20670v1\", \"title\": \"FBRT-YOLO: Faster and Better for Real-Time Aerial Image Detection\", \"summary\": \"Embedded flight devices with visual capabilities have become essential for a\\nwide range of applications. In aerial image detection, while many existing\\nmethods have partially addressed the issue of small target detection,\\nchallenges remain in optimizing small target detection and balancing detection\\naccuracy with efficiency. These issues are key obstacles to the advancement of\\nreal-time aerial image detection. In this paper, we propose a new family of\\nreal-time detectors for aerial image detection, named FBRT-YOLO, to address the\\nimbalance between detection accuracy and efficiency. Our method comprises two\\nlightweight modules: Feature Complementary Mapping Module (FCM) and\\nMulti-Kernel Perception Unit(MKP), designed to enhance object perception for\\nsmall targets in aerial images. FCM focuses on alleviating the problem of\\ninformation imbalance caused by the loss of small target information in deep\\nnetworks. It aims to integrate spatial positional information of targets more\\ndeeply into the network,better aligning with semantic information in the deeper\\nlayers to improve the localization of small targets. We introduce MKP, which\\nleverages convolutions with kernels of different sizes to enhance the\\nrelationships between targets of various scales and improve the perception of\\ntargets at different scales. Extensive experimental results on three major\\naerial image datasets, including Visdrone, UAVDT, and AI-TOD,demonstrate that\\nFBRT-YOLO outperforms various real-time detectors in terms of performance and\\nspeed.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-29T11:53:54Z\"}"}
