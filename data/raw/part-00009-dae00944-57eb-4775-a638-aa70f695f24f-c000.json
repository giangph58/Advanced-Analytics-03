{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02513v1\", \"title\": \"Adaptive Bivariate Quarklet Tree Approximation via Anisotropic Tensor\\n  Quarklets\", \"summary\": \"This paper deals with near-best approximation of a given bivariate function\\nusing elements of quarkonial tensor frames. For that purpose we apply\\nanisotropic tensor products of the univariate B-spline quarklets introduced\\naround 2017 by Dahlke, Keding and Raasch. We introduce the concept of bivariate\\nquarklet trees and develop an adaptive algorithm which allows for generalized\\nhp-approximation of a given bivariate function by selected frame elements. It\\nis proved that this algorithm is near-best, which means that as long as some\\nstandard conditions concerning local errors are fulfilled it provides an\\napproximation with an error close to that one of the best possible quarklet\\ntree approximation. For this algorithm the complexity is investigated.\\nMoreover, we use our techniques to approximate a bivariate test function with\\ninverse-exponential rates of convergence. It can be expected that the results\\npresented in this paper serve as important building block for the design of\\nadaptive wavelet-hp-methods for solving PDEs in the bivariate setting with very\\ngood convergence properties.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA,math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T11:55:32Z\"}"}
