We find two distinct\\nchemical populations in both overdensities, which is in disagreement with the\\nmainstream hypothesis that both overdensities are composed of materials from a\\nsingle merger event, namely Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE). The two populations\\nshow different chemical trends: one exhibits low metallicities and high\\n$\\\\alpha$ abundances, and the other shows high metallicities and low $\\\\alpha$\\nabundances, which is associated with the recently discovered Nereus and Virgo\\nRadial Merger (VRM) components in the local stellar halo, respectively. The\\nNereus component in these overdensities uniquely exhibits a decreasing trend in\\nthe [Fe/H]-[Mn/Fe] plane. Out of all observed Milky Way dwarf galaxies, this\\ntrend is only found in the Sculptor dwarf galaxy, which provides clues for the\\nproperties of Nereus progenitor. We also find that the velocity ellipse with\\nhigh aniostropy parameters that is usually considered to be part of GSE are\\nactually a mix of the two components. Both overdensities are well-mixed in\\nkinematic spaces, confirming recent claims that the debris of merger pairs are\\nkinematically indistinguishable in a recent simulation. We find that the\\nvelocity ellipses of the VRM stars in these overdensities have large\\ninclination angles, which may be an indication of the merger time in simulated\\nmerger events.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:34:47Z\"}"}
