We follow the recent line of work on discrete\\nleast action principle for fluid and plasma equation, incorporating the recent\\nadvances to model dissipative phenomena through a generalized Lagrange-d\\nAlembert constrained variational principle. We prove that our semi-discrete\\nscheme is equivalent to a metriplectic system and use this property to propose\\na Poisson splitting time integration. The resulting approximation preserves\\nmass, energy and the divergence constraint of the magnetic field. We then show\\nsome numerical results obtained with our approach. We first test our scheme on\\nsimple academic test to compare the results with established methodologies, and\\nthen focus specifically on the simulation of plasma instabilities, with some\\ntests on non Cartesian geometries to validate our discretization in the scope\\nof tokamak instabilities.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T15:12:32Z\"}"}
