{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02766v1\", \"title\": \"On Composable and Parametric Uncertainty in Systems Co-Design\", \"summary\": \"Optimizing the design of complex systems requires navigating interdependent\\ndecisions, heterogeneous components, and multiple objectives. Our monotone\\ntheory of co-design offers a compositional framework for addressing this\\nchallenge, modeling systems as Design Problems (DPs), representing trade-offs\\nbetween functionalities and resources within partially ordered sets. While\\ncurrent approaches model uncertainty using intervals, capturing worst- and\\nbest-case bounds, they fail to express probabilistic notions such as risk and\\nconfidence. These limitations hinder the applicability of co-design in domains\\nwhere uncertainty plays a critical role. In this paper, we introduce a unified\\nframework for composable uncertainty in co-design, capturing intervals,\\ndistributions, and parametrized models. This extension enables reasoning about\\nrisk-performance trade-offs and supports advanced queries such as experiment\\ndesign, learning, and multi-stage decision making. We demonstrate the\\nexpressiveness and utility of the framework via a numerical case study on the\\nuncertainty-aware co-design of task-driven Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T17:02:32Z\"}"}
