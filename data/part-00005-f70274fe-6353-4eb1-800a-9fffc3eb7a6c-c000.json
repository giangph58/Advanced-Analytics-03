{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06871v1\", \"title\": \"Two types of elliptic dark soliton solutions for the Hirota equation\", \"summary\": \"We primarily study concave-downward and convex-upward types of elliptic dark\\nsoliton solutions for the Hirota equation, exhibiting a concave-downward shape\\non both upper and lower envelope surfaces and showing a convex-upward shape on\\nthe lower envelope surface, respectively. By analyzing the supremum and infimum\\nof solutions, we provide the existence conditions for these two types of\\nelliptic dark solitons. Additionally, we study two-elliptic dark soliton\\nsolutions combining both types with the same velocity and investigate the\\nelastic collisions between these two types of solutions with different\\nvelocities.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.SI\", \"categories\": \"nlin.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:21:54Z\"}"}
