However this mass loss is theoretically expected to\\ndepend upon the microphysical properties of protoplanetary discs, which are\\ncurrently poorly constrained in observations. In this work we explore the\\nimpact of microphysics on the bulk evolution of discs. The polycyclic aromatic\\nhydrocarbon (PAH) abundance, and the extent to which grain growth has occurred\\nin the disc have profound effects on the strength of mass loss rates due to\\nexternal photoevaporation, which in turn can have a significant impact on the\\ndisc evolution, impacting disc radii and accretion rates over time. The\\nstrongest sensitivity is to whether grain growth has occurred in the disc,\\nwhich reduces the amount of dust entrained in the wind to shield the disc, thus\\nincreasing the rate at which gas is lost. Additionally, larger PAH abundances\\nresult in stronger heating and higher mass loss rates, but to a lesser extent\\nthan grain growth. We find that plausible variations in the PAH abundance and\\ndisc dust evolution can leave observable differences in disc populations. This\\nwork highlights the importance of obtaining observational constraints of the\\nmicrophysical properties of protoplanetary discs. Future observations from JWST\\nshould soon be able to provide these constraints.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:30:58Z\"}"}
