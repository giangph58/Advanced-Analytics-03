Business process management systems have evolved on the\\nbasis of workflow management systems through incremental inclusion of standard\\ninformation system functions, for example, resource and client management. The\\napplication of model driven development is required to deal with the complexity\\nof business management systems and to increase development efficiency. In\\ncontrast to conventional information systems, the behavior of business\\nmanagement systems is strongly affected by the business models that they\\nexecute. Thus, business process models also can be used for designing and\\ndeveloping business management systems using sequentially applied model\\ntransformations that adapt models to a specific execution platform.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T09:46:54Z\"}"}
