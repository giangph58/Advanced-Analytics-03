{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04899v1\", \"title\": \"Achieving precision in measuring birefringence characteristics of a\\n  periodically-poled Lithium Niobate waveguide\", \"summary\": \"The refraction of light in an optical medium is not only a subject of\\nfundamental interest, but the refractive index also plays a crucial role in\\napplications involving integrated and non-linear optics. One such application\\nis photon-pair generation in waveguides with second-order non-linearity. The\\nspectral properties of the generated photon pairs are governed by the effective\\ngroup refractive indices of the interacting modes, which normally are\\ncalculated via Sellmeier's equations for bulk crystals. However, in integrated\\noptics, the effective group refractive indices experienced by the propagating\\nmodes can differ from those in bulk materials. Therefore, we present an\\naccurate, in-situ measurement technique for determining the birefringence\\ncharacteristics of a structure with high reflective end facets by performing a\\nFourier transformation of the light transmission spectrum and apply this method\\nto a periodically-poled Lithium Niobate waveguide resonator in the telecom\\nwavelength range. We directly predict important spectral figures of merit of\\nthe photon-pair generation process, which depend on the optical path length\\ndifference that can be resolved with a high precision of more than 16 standard\\ndeviations.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T10:15:03Z\"}"}
