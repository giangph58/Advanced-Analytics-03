{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24258v1\", \"title\": \"Beyond a Single Mode: GAN Ensembles for Diverse Medical Data Generation\", \"summary\": \"The advancement of generative AI, particularly in medical imaging, confronts\\nthe trilemma of ensuring high fidelity, diversity, and efficiency in synthetic\\ndata generation. While Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown\\npromise across various applications, they still face challenges like mode\\ncollapse and insufficient coverage of real data distributions. This work\\nexplores the use of GAN ensembles to overcome these limitations, specifically\\nin the context of medical imaging. By solving a multi-objective optimisation\\nproblem that balances fidelity and diversity, we propose a method for selecting\\nan optimal ensemble of GANs tailored for medical data. The selected ensemble is\\ncapable of generating diverse synthetic medical images that are representative\\nof true data distributions and computationally efficient. Each model in the\\nensemble brings a unique contribution, ensuring minimal redundancy. We\\nconducted a comprehensive evaluation using three distinct medical datasets,\\ntesting 22 different GAN architectures with various loss functions and\\nregularisation techniques. By sampling models at different training epochs, we\\ncrafted 110 unique configurations. The results highlight the capability of GAN\\nensembles to enhance the quality and utility of synthetic medical images,\\nthereby improving the efficacy of downstream tasks such as diagnostic\\nmodelling.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:06:01Z\"}"}
