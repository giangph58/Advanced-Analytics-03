We compare their inclusive multiplicities emitted in the\\ntransverse plane of the reaction with the predictions given by the thermal\\nmodel. As a first step, we validate the choice of this approach to describe the\\nexperimental measurements. We also show that the transient states have to be\\nexplicitly taken into account for a good statistical description of the\\nexperimental multiplicities. From the thermodynamical parameter values obtained\\nwe complete the existing database built with the use of thermal-statistical\\nmodels to reproduce particle production in the (ultra-)relativistic-energy\\nmeasurements. We then proposed a new constraint on the so-called freeze-out\\nregion in the temperature (T) versus baryonic chemical potential (muB) phase\\ndiagram of the quantum chromodynamics. These new results indicate that there is\\na common framework to describe the hadron production and nuclear clustering\\nprocesses in heavy-ion collisions.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,hep-ph,nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T07:43:48Z\"}"}
