For the encoding process, we employ a four level\\n``quantization'' scheme, which employs monotone function thresholds as opposed\\nto fixed constant thresholds. Leveraging the hitting times of the Wiener\\nprocess with these thresholds, we devise a sampling and encoding strategy which\\ndoes not incur any quantization errors. We give analytical expressions for the\\nmean squared error (MSE) and find the optimal source code lengths to minimize\\nthe MSE under this monotone function threshold scheme, subject to a sampling\\nrate constraint.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,cs.SY,eess.SP,eess.SY,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T17:40:06Z\"}"}
