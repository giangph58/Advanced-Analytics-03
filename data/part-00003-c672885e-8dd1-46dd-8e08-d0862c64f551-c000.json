Recent\\napproaches based on machine learning (ML) have shown superior performance in\\nmonitoring interference. However, their feasibility in real-world applications\\nand environments has yet to be assessed. Effective implementation of ML\\ntechniques requires training datasets that incorporate realistic interference\\nsignals, including real-world noise and potential multipath effects that may\\noccur between transmitter, receiver, and satellite in the operational area.\\nAdditionally, these datasets require reference labels. Creating such datasets\\nis often challenging due to legal restrictions, as causing interference to GNSS\\nsources is strictly prohibited. Consequently, the performance of ML-based\\nmethods in practical applications remains unclear. To address this gap, we\\ndescribe a series of large-scale measurement campaigns conducted in real-world\\nsettings at two highway locations in Germany and the Seetal Alps in Austria,\\nand in large-scale controlled indoor environments. We evaluate the latest\\nsupervised ML-based methods to report on their performance in real-world\\nsettings and present the applicability of pseudo-labeling for unsupervised\\nlearning. We demonstrate the challenges of combining datasets due to data\\ndiscrepancies and evaluate outlier detection, domain adaptation, and data\\naugmentation techniques to present the models' capabilities to adapt to changes\\nin the datasets.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T06:51:52Z\"}"}
