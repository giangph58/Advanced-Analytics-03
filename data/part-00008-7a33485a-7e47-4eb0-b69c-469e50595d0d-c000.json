{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06762v1\", \"title\": \"Matching and Edge Cover in Temporal Graphs\", \"summary\": \"Temporal graphs are a special class of graphs for which a temporal component\\nis added to edges, that is, each edge possesses a set of times at which it is\\navailable and can be traversed. Many classical problems on graphs can be\\ntranslated to temporal graphs, and the results may differ. In this paper, we\\ndefine the Temporal Edge Cover and Temporal Matching problems and show that\\nthey are NP-complete even when fixing the lifetime or when the underlying graph\\nis a tree. We then describe two FPT algorithms, with parameters lifetime and\\ntreewidth, that solve the two problems. We also find lower bounds for the\\napproximation of the two problems and give two approximation algorithms which\\nmatch these bounds. Finally, we discuss the differences between the problems in\\nthe temporal and the static framework.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS,cs.CC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T10:33:10Z\"}"}
