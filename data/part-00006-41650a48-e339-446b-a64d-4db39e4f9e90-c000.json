This visionary project will allow for transformative measurements\\nacross a very broad range of topics, which in almost all cases will exceed in\\nsensitivity the projections of any other proposed facility, and simultaneously\\nprovide the best possible opportunity for discovering physics beyond the\\nStandard Model. The highlights of the physics programme are presented, together\\nwith discussion on the key attributes of the integrated project that enable the\\nphysics reach. It is noted that the baseline programme of FCC-ee, in\\nparticular, is both flexible and extendable, and also that the synergy and\\ncomplementarity of the electron and proton machines, and the sharing of a\\ncommon infrastructure, provides a remarkably efficient, timely and\\ncost-effective approach to addressing the most pressing open questions in\\nelementary particle physics.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:31:24Z\"}"}
