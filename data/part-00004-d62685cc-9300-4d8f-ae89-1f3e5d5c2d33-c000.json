{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06258v1\", \"title\": \"Two-Dimensional Ferroelectric Altermagnets: From Model to Material\\n  Realization\", \"summary\": \"Multiferroic altermagnets offer new opportunities for magnetoelectric\\ncoupling and electrically tunable spintronics. However, due to intrinsic\\nsymmetry conflicts between altermagnetism and ferroelectricity, achieving their\\ncoexistence, known as ferroelectric altermagnets (FEAM), remains an outstanding\\nchallenge, especially in two-dimensional (2D) systems. Here, we propose a\\nuniversal, symmetry-based design principle for 2D FEAM, supported by\\ntight-binding models and first-principles calculations. We show that\\nferroelectric lattice distortions can break spin equivalence and introduce the\\nnecessary rotational symmetry, enabling altermagnetism with electrically\\nreversible spin splitting. Guided by this framework, we identify a family of 2D\\nvanadium oxyhalides and sulfide halides as promising FEAM candidates. In these\\ncompounds, pseudo Jahn-Teller distortions and Peierls-like dimerization\\ncooperatively establish the required symmetry conditions. We further propose\\nthe magneto-optical Kerr effect as an experimental probe to confirm FEAM and\\nits electric spin reversal. Our findings provide a practical framework for 2D\\nFEAM and advancing electrically controlled spintronic devices.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T17:58:59Z\"}"}
