In this work, we investigate two-step crystallization\\nin colloid-polymer mixtures via an intermediate liquid phase. Using CNT-based\\nseeding simulations, we construct a kinetic phase diagram that identifies\\nregions of phase space where the critical nucleus is either liquid or\\ncrystalline. These predictions are validated using transition path sampling\\nsimulations at nine different relevant state points. When the critical nucleus\\nis liquid, crystallization occurs stochastically during the growth phase,\\nwhereas for a crystalline critical nucleus, the crystallization process happens\\npre-critically at a fixed nucleus size. We conclude that CNT-based kinetic\\nphase diagrams are a powerful tool for understanding and predicting\\n`non-classical' crystal nucleation mechanisms.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:29:56Z\"}"}
