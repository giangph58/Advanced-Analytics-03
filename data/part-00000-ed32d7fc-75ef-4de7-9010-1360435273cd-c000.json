While short-form video\\nunderstanding has advanced rapidly, a solution for maintaining coherent\\nlong-term visual storytelling remains unresolved. Existing methods rely solely\\non frame-level embeddings, effectively describing object-based content but\\nlacking contextual information across scenes. We introduce DANTE-AD, an\\nenhanced video description model leveraging a dual-vision Transformer-based\\narchitecture to address this gap. DANTE-AD sequentially fuses both frame and\\nscene level embeddings to improve long-term contextual understanding. We\\npropose a novel, state-of-the-art method for sequential cross-attention to\\nachieve contextual grounding for fine-grained audio description generation.\\nEvaluated on a broad range of key scenes from well-known movie clips, DANTE-AD\\noutperforms existing methods across traditional NLP metrics and LLM-based\\nevaluations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:49:43Z\"}"}
