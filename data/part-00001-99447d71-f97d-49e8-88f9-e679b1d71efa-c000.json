{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24155v1\", \"title\": \"The Belle II Experiment at SuperKEKB -- Input to the European Particle\\n  Physics Strategy\", \"summary\": \"Belle II is an intensity-frontier experiment at the SuperKEKB collider in\\nTsukuba, Japan. Over the coming decades, it will record the decays of billions\\nof bottom mesons, charm hadrons, and tau leptons produced in 10 GeV\\nelectron-positron collisions. The experiment's low-background environment and\\nprecisely known kinematics enable high-precision measurements of hundreds of\\nStandard Model (SM) parameters while probing for new particles at mass scales\\nfar beyond the direct reach of high-energy colliders. We project Belle II's\\nsensitivity for key measurements - where it will be uniquely positioned or\\nworld-leading - over datasets ranging from 1 to 50 ab${}^{-1}$. By exploring\\npreviously uncharted regions of non-SM parameter space with high precision,\\nBelle II will either reveal new physics or set stringent constraints, guiding\\nfuture experimental and theoretical efforts. Additionally, we outline near-term\\nupgrades to the Belle II detector and SuperKEKB accelerator, which will enhance\\nsensitivity in searches for new physics beyond the SM across flavor, tau,\\nelectroweak, and dark sector physics. These improvements will ensure that Belle\\nII remains both complementary to and competitive with the LHC and other\\nexperiments.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:39:29Z\"}"}
