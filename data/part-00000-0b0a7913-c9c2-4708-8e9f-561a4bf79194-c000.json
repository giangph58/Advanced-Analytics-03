We study this model with a rate $p$ of magnetic site vacancies\\nthrough a numerical approach. First, we analyze the effect of few impurities on\\nthe ground state, favouring non-coplanar configurations. Second, for finite\\ndilutions, we perform parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations in the $(T,p)$\\nplane, showing the emergence of a low-temperature chiral phase and the\\nprogressive destruction of the $q=4$ Potts transition. This is a rare example\\nof competing order parameters that exclude each other, whith the chiral one\\nappearing only due to disorder.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:25:37Z\"}"}
