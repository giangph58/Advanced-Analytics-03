Using a synchro-curvature model we\\ncompare our theoretical output with the observational data published in the\\nThird Fermi Pulsar Catalog, which has significantly increased the number of\\nknown gamma-ray pulsars. Our model properly fits all the spectra and reproduces\\nwell a considerable fraction of light curves. Light curve fitting is carried\\nout with two different techniques, whose strong points and caveats are\\ndiscussed. We use a weighted reduced \\\\{chi}^2 of light curves in time domain,\\nand the Euclidean distance of the Fourier transform of the light curves, i.e.\\ntransforming the light curves to the frequency domain. The performance of both\\nmethods is found to be qualitatively similar, but individual best-fit solutions\\nmay differ. We also show that, in our model based on few effective parameters,\\nthe light curve fitting is basically insensitive to the timing and spectral\\nparameters of the pulsar. Finally, we look for correlations between model and\\nphysical parameters, and recover trends found in previous studies but without\\nany significant correlation involving geometrical parameters.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T16:53:11Z\"}"}
