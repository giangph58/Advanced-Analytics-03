{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05758v1\", \"title\": \"Addressing Class Imbalance with Probabilistic Graphical Models and\\n  Variational Inference\", \"summary\": \"This study proposes a method for imbalanced data classification based on deep\\nprobabilistic graphical models (DPGMs) to solve the problem that traditional\\nmethods have insufficient learning ability for minority class samples. To\\naddress the classification bias caused by class imbalance, we introduce\\nvariational inference optimization probability modeling, which enables the\\nmodel to adaptively adjust the representation ability of minority classes and\\ncombines the class-aware weight adjustment strategy to enhance the classifier's\\nsensitivity to minority classes. In addition, we combine the adversarial\\nlearning mechanism to generate minority class samples in the latent space so\\nthat the model can better characterize the category boundary in the\\nhigh-dimensional feature space. The experiment is evaluated on the Kaggle\\n\\\"Credit Card Fraud Detection\\\" dataset and compared with a variety of advanced\\nimbalanced classification methods (such as GAN-based sampling, BRF,\\nXGBoost-Cost Sensitive, SAAD, HAN). The results show that the method in this\\nstudy has achieved the best performance in AUC, Precision, Recall and F1-score\\nindicators, effectively improving the recognition rate of minority classes and\\nreducing the false alarm rate. This method can be widely used in imbalanced\\nclassification tasks such as financial fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and\\nanomaly detection, providing a new solution for related research.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T07:38:30Z\"}"}
