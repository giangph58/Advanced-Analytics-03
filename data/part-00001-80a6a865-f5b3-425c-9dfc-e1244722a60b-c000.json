{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05783v1\", \"title\": \"Video Flow as Time Series: Discovering Temporal Consistency and\\n  Variability for VideoQA\", \"summary\": \"Video Question Answering (VideoQA) is a complex video-language task that\\ndemands a sophisticated understanding of both visual content and temporal\\ndynamics. Traditional Transformer-style architectures, while effective in\\nintegrating multimodal data, often simplify temporal dynamics through\\npositional encoding and fail to capture non-linear interactions within video\\nsequences. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Trio Transformer (T3T), a\\nnovel architecture that models time consistency and time variability. The T3T\\nintegrates three key components: Temporal Smoothing (TS), Temporal Difference\\n(TD), and Temporal Fusion (TF). The TS module employs Brownian Bridge for\\ncapturing smooth, continuous temporal transitions, while the TD module\\nidentifies and encodes significant temporal variations and abrupt changes\\nwithin the video content. Subsequently, the TF module synthesizes these\\ntemporal features with textual cues, facilitating a deeper contextual\\nunderstanding and response accuracy. The efficacy of the T3T is demonstrated\\nthrough extensive testing on multiple VideoQA benchmark datasets. Our results\\nunderscore the importance of a nuanced approach to temporal modeling in\\nimproving the accuracy and depth of video-based question answering.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T08:08:03Z\"}"}
