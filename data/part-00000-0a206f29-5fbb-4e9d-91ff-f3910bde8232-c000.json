While tests such as ultrasound scans offer high\\naccuracy, they can be costly and inconvenient. Telehealth and more accessible\\nbody shape information provide pregnant women with a convenient way to monitor\\ntheir health. This study explores the potential of 3D body scan data, captured\\nduring the 18-24 gestational weeks, to predict adverse pregnancy outcomes and\\nestimate clinical parameters. We developed a novel algorithm with two parallel\\nstreams which are used for extract body shape features: one for supervised\\nlearning to extract sequential abdominal circumference information, and another\\nfor unsupervised learning to extract global shape descriptors, alongside a\\nbranch for demographic data.\\n  Our results indicate that 3D body shape can assist in predicting preterm\\nlabor, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), gestational hypertension (GH), and\\nin estimating fetal weight. Compared to other machine learning models, our\\nalgorithm achieved the best performance, with prediction accuracies exceeding\\n88% and fetal weight estimation accuracy of 76.74% within a 10% error margin,\\noutperforming conventional anthropometric methods by 22.22%.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T03:02:26Z\"}"}
