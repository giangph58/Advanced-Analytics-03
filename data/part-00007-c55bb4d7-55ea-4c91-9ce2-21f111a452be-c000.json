In this work, we\\nreport the very first experimental realization of a fully analog,\\nphase-preserving time-reversal architecture for optically-carried\\nradiofrequency signals. The method exploits the exceptional coherence\\nproperties of rare-earth ion-doped materials, and leverages the\\nwell-established photon echo mechanism, widely used in quantum technologies.\\nWhile our demonstration is conducted with a modest bandwidth, we identify the\\nfundamental cause of this limitation and propose solutions for future\\nscalability.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,physics.atom-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:52:41Z\"}"}
