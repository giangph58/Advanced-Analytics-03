{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01621v1\", \"title\": \"Two-photon microscopy using picosecond pulses from four-wave mixing in a\\n  Yb-doped photonic crystal fiber\", \"summary\": \"Two-photon microscopy (TPM) enables deep tissue imaging but requires\\nexcitation pulses that have a large product of average and peak power,\\ntypically supplied by femtosecond solid-state lasers. However, these lasers are\\nbulky and femtosecond pulses require careful dispersion management to avoid\\npulse broadening, particularly when delivery fibers are used. Here we present a\\ncompact, fiber-based picosecond laser source operating at 790 nm for TPM using\\na ytterbium-doped photonic crystal fiber (Yb-doped PCF). The Yb-doped PCF\\nsimultaneously amplifies 1064 nm input pulses and efficiently converts them to\\n790 nm via four-wave mixing, generating pulses with a peak power of up to ~3.8\\nkW. The source has a variable repetition rate (1.48 MHz-14.78 MHz), enabling\\nthe two-photon excitation fluorescence signal to be maximized in the presence\\nof excitation saturation. We benchmark our picosecond laser source against a\\nfemtosecond Ti:Sapphire laser for TPM of stained Convallaria majalis samples\\nand demonstrate comparable fluorescence signal when the two-photon excitation\\nconditions are matched.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:30:04Z\"}"}
