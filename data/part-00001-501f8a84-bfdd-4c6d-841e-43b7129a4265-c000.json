We realize Jiro Adachi's contact round surgeries as\\nspecial cases. We show that every closed connected contact 3-manifold can be\\nobtained by performing a sequence of contact round surgeries on some Legendrian\\nlink in $\\\\left(\\\\mathbb{S}^3, \\\\xi_{st}\\\\right)$, thus obtaining a contact round\\nsurgery diagram for each contact 3-manifold. This is analogous to a similar\\nresult of Ding and Geiges for contact Dehn surgeries. We discuss a bridge\\nbetween certain pairs of contact round surgery diagrams of index 1 and 2 and\\ncontact $\\\\pm1$-surgery diagrams. We use this bridge to establish the result\\nmentioned above.\", \"main_category\": \"math.SG\", \"categories\": \"math.SG,math.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:12:27Z\"}"}
