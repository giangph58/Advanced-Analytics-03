This technique, combined with a\\nrigidity result and a specific choice of the kernel projection in the\\nPoincar\\\\'e inequality, might be employed to completely linearize blow-ups along\\nat least one sequence. We show how to implement such argument by applying it to\\nderive affine blow-up limits for $\\\\mathrm{BD}$ and $\\\\mathrm{BV}$ functions\\naround Cantor points. In doing so we identify a specific subset of points -\\ncalled totally singular points having blow-ups with completely singular\\ngradient measure $D p=D^s p$, $\\\\mathcal{E} p=\\\\mathcal{E}^s p$ - at which such\\nlinearization fails.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T11:13:47Z\"}"}
