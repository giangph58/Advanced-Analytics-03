{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24389v1\", \"title\": \"SU-YOLO: Spiking Neural Network for Efficient Underwater Object\\n  Detection\", \"summary\": \"Underwater object detection is critical for oceanic research and industrial\\nsafety inspections. However, the complex optical environment and the limited\\nresources of underwater equipment pose significant challenges to achieving high\\naccuracy and low power consumption. To address these issues, we propose Spiking\\nUnderwater YOLO (SU-YOLO), a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) model. Leveraging the\\nlightweight and energy-efficient properties of SNNs, SU-YOLO incorporates a\\nnovel spike-based underwater image denoising method based solely on integer\\naddition, which enhances the quality of feature maps with minimal computational\\noverhead. In addition, we introduce Separated Batch Normalization (SeBN), a\\ntechnique that normalizes feature maps independently across multiple time steps\\nand is optimized for integration with residual structures to capture the\\ntemporal dynamics of SNNs more effectively. The redesigned spiking residual\\nblocks integrate the Cross Stage Partial Network (CSPNet) with the YOLO\\narchitecture to mitigate spike degradation and enhance the model's feature\\nextraction capabilities. Experimental results on URPC2019 underwater dataset\\ndemonstrate that SU-YOLO achieves mAP of 78.8% with 6.97M parameters and an\\nenergy consumption of 2.98 mJ, surpassing mainstream SNN models in both\\ndetection accuracy and computational efficiency. These results underscore the\\npotential of SNNs for engineering applications.
