However, not all settings are conducive to live\\ncoding and not all instructors are successful in this challenging task. We\\npresent results from a study involving university instructors, teaching\\nassistants, and students identifying both barriers and benefits of live coding.\\nPhysical infrastructure, a positive classroom community with psychological\\nsafety, and opportunities for teacher development are practical considerations\\nfor live coding. In order for live coding to be an active learning experience,\\nwe recommend that tools support multiple mechanisms for engaging students,\\ndirecting audience attention, and encouraging student-led live coding.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T13:50:56Z\"}"}
