{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02592v1\", \"title\": \"Unified Equation for Massless Spin Particles and New Spin Coefficient\\n  Definitions\", \"summary\": \"We introduce a new definition for the spin coefficients $\\\\rho$, $\\\\mu$,\\n$\\\\tau$, and $\\\\pi$, which are defined as the directional derivatives of the\\nlogarithm of a generating function along the null tetrad ($l^{\\\\mu}$, $n^{\\\\mu}$,\\n$m^{\\\\mu}$, $\\\\bar{m}^{\\\\mu}$), respectively. This is the first discovery that\\nthese spin coefficients are interconnected through a generating function. Using\\nthe newly defined spin coefficients, we find that the field equations for\\nmassless particles with spins 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, and 2 in arbitrary black hole\\nspacetimes can be described by a single unified equation. This finding is\\nparticularly surprising, as unifying these field equations is already a\\nsignificant challenge in flat spacetime, let alone in the intricate spacetime\\naround black holes. Consequently, this work will inevitably prompt a\\nre-examination of the shared characteristics among various types of particles\\nin black hole spacetimes. Meanwhile, we verify the correctness of the new\\ndefinition for the spin coefficients, and provide the explicit form of the\\nunified equation for nearly all known black hole backgrounds. This lays a solid\\nfoundation for studying the behavior of massless spin particles in any black\\nhole background.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T13:55:24Z\"}"}
