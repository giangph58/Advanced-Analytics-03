An interesting\\nproblem regarding these convergences is to investigate when any two of them are\\nequivalent. In this article, we investigate the relation of\\n$\\\\tau_{\\\\mathcal{S},d}$-convergence with the other two convergences, which is\\nnot completely transparent. As a main tool for our investigation, we use the\\nidea of pointwise enlargement of a set by a positive Lipschitz function. As\\napplications of our results, we provide new proofs of some known results about\\nAttouch-Wets convergence.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GN\", \"categories\": \"math.GN,math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T07:04:30Z\"}"}
