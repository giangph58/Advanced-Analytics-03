{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06781v1\", \"title\": \"Domain Generalization through Attenuation of Domain-Specific Information\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we propose a new evaluation metric called Domain Independence\\n(DI) and Attenuation of Domain-Specific Information (ADSI) which is\\nspecifically designed for domain-generalized semantic segmentation in\\nautomotive images. DI measures the presence of domain-specific information: a\\nlower DI value indicates strong domain dependence, while a higher DI value\\nsuggests greater domain independence. This makes it roughly where\\ndomain-specific information exists and up to which frequency range it is\\npresent. As a result, it becomes possible to effectively suppress only the\\nregions in the image that contain domain-specific information, enabling feature\\nextraction independent of the domain. ADSI uses a Butterworth filter to remove\\nthe low-frequency components of images that contain inherent domain-specific\\ninformation such as sensor characteristics and lighting conditions. However,\\nsince low-frequency components also contain important information such as\\ncolor, we should not remove them completely. Thus, a scalar value (ranging from\\n0 to 1) is multiplied by the low-frequency components to retain essential\\ninformation. This helps the model learn more domain-independent features. In\\nexperiments, GTA5 (synthetic dataset) was used as training images, and a\\nreal-world dataset was used for evaluation, and the proposed method\\noutperformed conventional approaches. Similarly, in experiments that the\\nCityscapes (real-world dataset) was used for training and various environment\\ndatasets such as rain and nighttime were used for evaluation, the proposed\\nmethod demonstrated its robustness under nighttime conditions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T11:10:29Z\"}"}
