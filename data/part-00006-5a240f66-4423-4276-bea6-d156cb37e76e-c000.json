{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02370v1\", \"title\": \"A Spectral Approach for Quasinormal Frequencies of Noncommutative\\n  Geometry-inspired Wormholes\", \"summary\": \"We present a detailed investigation of quasinormal modes (QNMs) for\\nnoncommutative geometry-inspired wormholes, focusing on scalar,\\nelectromagnetic, and vector-type gravitational perturbations. By employing the\\nspectral method, the perturbation equations are reformulated into an eigenvalue\\nproblem over a compact domain, using Chebyshev polynomials to ensure high\\nprecision and fast numerical convergence. Our results reveal the absence of\\noverdamped modes, with all detected QNMs exhibiting oscillatory behaviour.\\nAdditionally, for large values of the rescaled mass parameter, the QNMs of the\\nnoncommutative wormhole transition smoothly to those of the classical\\nSchwarzschild wormhole, validating the accuracy of the spectral method. This\\nwork represents the first comprehensive exploration of QNMs in noncommutative\\ngeometry-inspired wormholes, shedding light on their stability and dynamical\\nproperties.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T08:04:17Z\"}"}
