Natural hazards are the cause of most life and\\nresource losses. The ability to define the conditions for a sustainable\\ndevelopment of humankind, to keep the Earth system within the boundaries of\\nhabitable states, or to predict critical transitions and events in the dynamics\\nof the Earth system are crucial to mitigate and adapt to Earth system related\\nevents and changes (e.g., volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, climate change) and\\nto avert the disastrous consequences of natural hazards. In this chapter, we\\ndiscuss key concepts from nonlinear physics and show that they enable us to\\ntreat challenging problems of Earth sciences which cannot be solved by classic\\nmethods. In particular, the concepts of multi-scaling, recurrence,\\nsynchronization, and complex networks have become crucial in the very last\\ndecades for a substantially more profound understanding of the dynamics of\\nearthquakes, landslides, or (palaeo-)climate. They can even provide a\\nsignificantly improved prediction of several high-impact extreme events.\\nAdditionally, crucial open challenges in the realm of methodological nature and\\napplications to Earth sciences are given.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.CD\", \"categories\": \"nlin.CD\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:33:57Z\"}"}
