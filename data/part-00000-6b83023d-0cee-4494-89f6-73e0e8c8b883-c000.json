{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06017v1\", \"title\": \"CAI: An Open, Bug Bounty-Ready Cybersecurity AI\", \"summary\": \"By 2028 most cybersecurity actions will be autonomous, with humans\\nteleoperating. We present the first classification of autonomy levels in\\ncybersecurity and introduce Cybersecurity AI (CAI), an open-source framework\\nthat democratizes advanced security testing through specialized AI agents.\\nThrough rigorous empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that CAI consistently\\noutperforms state-of-the-art results in CTF benchmarks, solving challenges\\nacross diverse categories with significantly greater efficiency -up to 3,600x\\nfaster than humans in specific tasks and averaging 11x faster overall. CAI\\nachieved first place among AI teams and secured a top-20 position worldwide in\\nthe \\\"AI vs Human\\\" CTF live Challenge, earning a monetary reward of $750. Based\\non our results, we argue against LLM-vendor claims about limited security\\ncapabilities. Beyond cybersecurity competitions, CAI demonstrates real-world\\neffectiveness, reaching top-30 in Spain and top-500 worldwide on Hack The Box\\nwithin a week, while dramatically reducing security testing costs by an average\\nof 156x. Our framework transcends theoretical benchmarks by enabling\\nnon-professionals to discover significant security bugs (CVSS 4.3-7.5) at rates\\ncomparable to experts during bug bounty exercises. By combining modular agent\\ndesign with seamless tool integration and human oversight (HITL), CAI addresses\\ncritical market gaps, offering organizations of all sizes access to AI-powered\\nbug bounty security testing previously available only to well-resourced firms\\n-thereby challenging the oligopolistic ecosystem currently dominated by major\\nbug bounty platforms.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:22:09Z\"}"}
