The energy spectrum in the single-excitation subspace features a\\ncontinuous band with scattering states, discrete levels with bound states, and\\na quantum phase transition characterized by the change of the number of bound\\nstates. The number of bound states is revealed by the behavior of the\\nexcited-state population at long times with quantum beat, residual oscillation,\\na constant with either non-zero or zero.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T07:45:42Z\"}"}
