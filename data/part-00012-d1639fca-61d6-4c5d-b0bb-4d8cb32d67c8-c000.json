{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01331v1\", \"title\": \"An Explainable Reconfiguration-Based Optimization Algorithm for\\n  Industrial and Reliability-Redundancy Allocation Problems\", \"summary\": \"Industrial and reliability optimization problems often involve complex\\nconstraints and require efficient, interpretable solutions. This paper presents\\nAI-AEFA, an advanced parameter reconfiguration-based metaheuristic algorithm\\ndesigned to address large-scale industrial and reliability-redundancy\\nallocation problems. AI-AEFA enhances search space exploration and convergence\\nefficiency through a novel log-sigmoid-based parameter adaptation and chaotic\\nmapping mechanism. The algorithm is validated across twenty-eight IEEE CEC 2017\\nconstrained benchmark problems, fifteen large-scale industrial optimization\\nproblems, and seven reliability-redundancy allocation problems, consistently\\noutperforming state-of-the-art optimization techniques in terms of feasibility,\\ncomputational efficiency, and convergence speed. The additional key\\ncontribution of this work is the integration of SHAP (Shapley Additive\\nExplanations) to enhance the interpretability of AI-AEFA, providing insights\\ninto the impact of key parameters such as Coulomb's constant, charge,\\nacceleration, and electrostatic force. This explainability feature enables a\\ndeeper understanding of decision-making within the AI-AEFA framework during the\\noptimization processes. The findings confirm AI-AEFA as a robust, scalable, and\\ninterpretable optimization tool with significant real-world applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.NE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T03:33:48Z\"}"}
