This work introduces\\nQuantum Unmanned Aerial Delivery Routing Optimization (QUADRO), a novel hybrid\\nframework addressing the Energy-Constrained Capacitated Unmanned Aerial Vehicle\\nRouting Problem and the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Scheduling Problem. By\\nformulating these challenges as Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization\\nproblems, QUADRO leverages the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm for\\nrouting and scheduling, enhanced by classical heuristics and post-processing.\\nWe minimize total transit time in routing, considering payload and battery\\nconstraints, and optimize makespan scheduling across various drone fleets.\\nEvaluated on adapted Augerat benchmarks (16-51 nodes), QUADRO competes against\\nclassical and prior hybrid methods, achieving scalable solutions with fewer\\nthan one hundred qubits. The proposed results underscore the viability of\\nhybrid quantum-classical strategies for real-world drone logistics, paving the\\nway for quantum-enhanced optimization in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum\\nera.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.ET\", \"categories\": \"cs.ET\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:44:42Z\"}"}
