One is related to a congruence subgroup of ${\\\\rm\\nSL}_2(\\\\mathbb{Z})$ and the other is relate to a congruence subgroup of the\\ntriangle group $\\\\Delta(2,4,5)\\\\subset {\\\\rm SL}_2(\\\\mathbb{R})$. To carry out the\\ncomputation, we use elliptic cusp forms of weight 2 for the former case while\\nthe automorphism group of Bring's curve for the latter case. We also discuss a\\nsuitable base field (a number field) for isomorphisms between Hulek-Craig's\\ncurve, Bring's curve, and its another algebraic model obtained as a modular\\ncurve.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT,math.AG,math.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T06:53:56Z\"}"}
