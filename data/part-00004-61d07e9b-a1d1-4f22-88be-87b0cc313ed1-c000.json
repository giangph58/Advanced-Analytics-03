From Philosophy to Causal Modeling\", \"summary\": \"Not much has been written about the role of triggers in the literature on\\ncausal reasoning, causal modeling, or philosophy. In this paper, we focus on\\ndescribing triggers and causes in the metaphysical sense and on\\ncharacterizations that differentiate them from each other. We carry out a\\nphilosophical analysis of these differences. From this, we formulate a\\ndefinition that clearly differentiates triggers from causes and can be used for\\ncausal reasoning in natural sciences. We propose a mathematical model and the\\nCause-Trigger algorithm, which, based on given data to observable processes, is\\nable to determine whether a process is a cause or a trigger of an effect. The\\npossibility to distinguish triggers from causes directly from data makes the\\nalgorithm a useful tool in natural sciences using observational data, but also\\nfor real-world scenarios. For example, knowing the processes that trigger\\ncauses of a tropical storm could give politicians time to develop actions such\\nas evacuation the population. Similarly, knowing the triggers of processes that\\ncause global warming could help politicians focus on effective actions. We\\ndemonstrate our algorithm on the climatological data of two recent cyclones,\\nFreddy and Zazu. The Cause-Trigger algorithm detects processes that trigger\\nhigh wind speed in both storms during their cyclogenesis. The findings obtained\\nagree with expert knowledge.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T06:37:48Z\"}"}
