{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05864v1\", \"title\": \"Tunable spin-orbit splitting in bilayer graphene/WSe$_2$ quantum devices\", \"summary\": \"Bilayer graphene (BLG)-based quantum devices represent a promising platform\\nfor emerging technologies such as quantum computing and spintronics. However,\\ntheir intrinsically weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC) presents a challenge for\\nspin and valley manipulation, as these applications operate more efficiently in\\nthe presence of strong SOC. Integrating BLG with transition metal\\ndichalcogenides (TMDs) significantly enhances SOC via proximity effects. While\\nthis enhancement has been experimentally demonstrated in 2D-layered structures,\\n1D and 0D-nanostructures in BLG/TMD remain unrealized, with open questions\\nregarding device quality, SOC strength, and tunability. In this work, we\\ninvestigate quantum point contacts and quantum dots in two BLG/WSe$_2$\\nheterostructures with different stacking orders. Across multiple devices, we\\ndemonstrate a reproducible enhancement of spin-orbit splitting\\n($\\\\Delta_\\\\mathrm{SO}$) reaching values of up to $1.5\\\\mathrm{meV}$ - more than\\none order of magnitude higher than in pristine bilayer graphene\\n($\\\\Delta_\\\\mathrm{SO}=40-80\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{eV}$). Furthermore, we show that the\\ninduced SOC can be tuned in situ from its maximum value to near-complete\\nsuppression by varying the perpendicular electric field, thereby controlling\\nlayer polarization. This enhancement and in situ tunability establish SOC as an\\nefficient control mechanism for dynamic spin and valley manipulation.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:44:16Z\"}"}
