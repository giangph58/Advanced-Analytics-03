{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06662v1\", \"title\": \"RAMBO: RL-augmented Model-based Optimal Control for Whole-body\\n  Loco-manipulation\", \"summary\": \"Loco-manipulation -- coordinated locomotion and physical interaction with\\nobjects -- remains a major challenge for legged robots due to the need for both\\naccurate force interaction and robustness to unmodeled dynamics. While\\nmodel-based controllers provide interpretable dynamics-level planning and\\noptimization, they are limited by model inaccuracies and computational cost. In\\ncontrast, learning-based methods offer robustness while struggling with precise\\nmodulation of interaction forces. We introduce RAMBO -- RL-Augmented\\nModel-Based Optimal Control -- a hybrid framework that integrates model-based\\nreaction force optimization using a simplified dynamics model and a feedback\\npolicy trained with reinforcement learning. The model-based module generates\\nfeedforward torques by solving a quadratic program, while the policy provides\\nfeedback residuals to enhance robustness in control execution. We validate our\\nframework on a quadruped robot across a diverse set of real-world\\nloco-manipulation tasks -- such as pushing a shopping cart, balancing a plate,\\nand holding soft objects -- in both quadrupedal and bipedal walking. Our\\nexperiments demonstrate that RAMBO enables precise manipulation while achieving\\nrobust and dynamic locomotion, surpassing the performance of policies trained\\nwith end-to-end scheme. In addition, our method enables flexible trade-off\\nbetween end-effector tracking accuracy with compliance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T07:53:09Z\"}"}
