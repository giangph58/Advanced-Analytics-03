MST generates hundreds of thousands of\\ntransient alerts every night, approximately 99\\\\% of which are false alarms,\\nposing a significant challenge to its scientific goals. To mitigate the impact\\nof false positives, we propose a deep learning-based solution and\\nsystematically evaluate thirteen convolutional neural networks. The results\\nshow that ResNet achieves exceptional specificity (99.70\\\\%),\\n  EfficientNet achieves the highest recall rate (98.68\\\\%), and DenseNet\\nprovides balanced performance with a recall rate of 94.55\\\\% and specificity of\\n98.66\\\\%. Leveraging these complementary strengths, we developed a bagging-based\\nensemble classifier that integrates ResNet18, DenseNet121, and EfficientNet\\\\_B0\\nusing a soft voting strategy. This classifier achieved the best AUC value\\n(0.9961) among all models, with a recall rate of 95.37\\\\% and specificity of\\n99.25\\\\%. It has now been successfully deployed in the MST real-time data\\nprocessing pipeline. Validation using 5,000 practically processed samples with\\na classification threshold of 0.798 showed that the classifier achieved 88.31\\\\%\\naccuracy, 91.89\\\\% recall rate, and 99.82\\\\% specificity, confirming its\\neffectiveness and robustness under real application conditions.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:25:59Z\"}"}
