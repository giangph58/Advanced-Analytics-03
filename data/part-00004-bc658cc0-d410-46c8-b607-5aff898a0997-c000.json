Additionally, employing the known\\nlocally repairable codes with super-linear length or maximum repairable\\nproperty, we provide explicit constructions of convertible codes with\\nsuper-linear length or maximum repairable property.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T09:46:08Z\"}"}
