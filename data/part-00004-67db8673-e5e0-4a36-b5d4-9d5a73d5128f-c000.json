Based on the\\nrecurrence relation between the leading poles following from the locality\\ncondition, we obtain a system of generalised renormalisation-group equations\\nthat can be studied numerically or analytically in some special cases. We study\\nthe simplest effective potentials for power-like models and give a comparison\\nof them in the framework of cosmological phenomenology.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T09:17:28Z\"}"}
