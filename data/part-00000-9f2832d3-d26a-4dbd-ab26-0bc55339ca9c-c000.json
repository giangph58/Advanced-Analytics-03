In this work, we give elementary\\nproofs of these generating functions by employing $q$-series manipulations and\\ndissection formulas. We also establish an infinite family of internal\\ncongruences modulo $3$ satisfied by $b(n)$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT,math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T12:17:11Z\"}"}
