{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24125v1\", \"title\": \"Evidence for the collective nature of radial flow in Pb+Pb collisions\\n  with the ATLAS detector\", \"summary\": \"Anisotropic flow and radial flow are two key probes of the expansion dynamics\\nand properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). While anisotropic flow has been\\nextensively studied, radial flow, which governs the system's radial expansion,\\nhas received less attention. Notably, experimental evidence for the global and\\ncollective nature of radial flow has been lacking. This Letter presents the\\nfirst measurement of transverse momentum ($p_{\\\\mathrm{T}}$) dependence of\\nradial flow fluctuations ($v_0(p_{\\\\mathrm{T}})$) over $0.5<p_{\\\\mathrm{T}}<10$\\nGeV, using a two-particle correlation method in Pb+Pb collisions at\\n$\\\\sqrt{s_{\\\\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV. The data reveal three key features\\nsupporting the collective nature of radial flow: long-range correlation in\\npseudorapidity, factorization in $p_{\\\\mathrm{T}}$, and centrality-independent\\nshape in $p_{\\\\mathrm{T}}$. The comparison with a hydrodynamic model\\ndemonstrates the sensitivity of $v_0(p_{\\\\mathrm{T}})$ to bulk viscosity, a\\ncrucial transport property of the QGP. These findings establish a new, powerful\\ntool for probing collective dynamics and properties of the QGP.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-ex\", \"categories\": \"nucl-ex,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:10:55Z\"}"}
