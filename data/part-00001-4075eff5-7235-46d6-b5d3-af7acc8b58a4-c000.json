We\\nprovide results in the range of Dini regular weights, and in the regime of\\nlogarithmic integral divergence. Our proofs are largely constructive, enabling\\nus to simplify and extend a classical result by Korenblum and Roberts, and a\\nrecent Theorem due to El-Fallah, Kellay, and Seip.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CV\", \"categories\": \"math.CV,math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T11:56:27Z\"}"}
