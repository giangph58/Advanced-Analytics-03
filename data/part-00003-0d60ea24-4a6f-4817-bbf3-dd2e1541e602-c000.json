However, existing works overlook adversarial robustness when the\\nsource domain itself is compromised. To comprehensively explore the robustness\\nof the UDA frameworks, we first design a stealthy adversarial point cloud\\ngeneration attack that can significantly contaminate datasets with only minor\\nperturbations to the point cloud surface. Based on that, we propose a novel\\ndataset, AdvSynLiDAR, comprising synthesized contaminated LiDAR point clouds.\\nWith the generated corrupted data, we further develop the Adversarial\\nAdaptation Framework (AAF) as the countermeasure. Specifically, by extending\\nthe key point sensitive (KPS) loss towards the Robust Long-Tail loss (RLT loss)\\nand utilizing a decoder branch, our approach enables the model to focus on\\nlong-tail classes during the pre-training phase and leverages high-confidence\\ndecoded point cloud information to restore point cloud structures during the\\nadaptation phase. We evaluated our AAF method on the AdvSynLiDAR dataset, where\\nthe results demonstrate that our AAF method can mitigate performance\\ndegradation under source adversarial perturbations for UDA in the 3D point\\ncloud segmentation application.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:11:34Z\"}"}
