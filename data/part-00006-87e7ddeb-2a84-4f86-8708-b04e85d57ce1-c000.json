{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05233v1\", \"title\": \"Formation of Near-surface Atmospheric Inversion and Surface Inversion in\\n  Hothouse Climates\", \"summary\": \"A hothouse climate may develop throughout Earth's history and its warming\\nfuture and on potentially habitable exoplanets near the inner edge of the\\nhabitable zone. Previous studies suggested that near-surface atmospheric\\ninversion (NAIV) with planetary boundary air temperature being higher than the\\nair temperature adjacent to the surface, is a pronounced phenomenon in hothouse\\nclimates. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here we show that\\nlower-tropospheric radiative heating is necessary but not independently\\nsufficient in forming the NAIV. Instead, the dynamic heating induced by\\nlarge-scale subsidence is essential. With the prescribed reasonable large-scale\\nsubsidence, NAIV appears in small-domain cloud-resolving simulations, which was\\nnot observed in previous studies. Surface evaporative cooling also contributes\\nto the formation of the NAIV. Besides NAIV, we find that surface inversion\\n(SIV) with the air adjacent to the surface being warmer than the underlying sea\\nsurface is also a distinct phenomenon in hothouse climates. SIV is caused by\\nstrong surface evaporative cooling and large atmospheric shortwave absorption.\\nThese two types of inversion strongly stabilize the atmosphere, weaken\\natmospheric circulation, dry the free troposphere, and suppress the\\nhydrological cycle.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,physics.ao-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T16:18:06Z\"}"}
