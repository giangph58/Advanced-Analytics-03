{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02820v1\", \"title\": \"Excitation of the Glashow resonance without neutrino beams\", \"summary\": \"The $s$-channel process $\\\\bar\\\\nu_ee^-\\\\rightarrow W^-$(on-shell) is now\\nreferred to as the Glashow resonance and being searched for at kilometer-scale\\nneutrino ice/water detectors like IceCube, Baikal-GVD or KM3NeT. After over a\\ndecade of observations, IceCube has recorded only a few relevant neutrino\\nevents such that further exploration yet remains necessary for unambiguous\\nconfirmation of the existence of this resonant interaction. Meanwhile, its\\nexperimental discovery would provide an additional important test of the\\nStandard Model. One might therefore ask: are there reactions with the Glashow\\nresonance that would not necessitate having initial (anti)neutrino beams? This\\narticle suggests a surprisingly positive answer to the question $-$ namely,\\nthat the process may proceed in electron-positron collisions at accelerator\\nenergies, occurring as $e^+e^-\\\\rightarrow W^-\\\\rho(770)^+$. Although the\\nresonance appears somewhat disguised, the underlying physics is transparent,\\nquite resembling the well known radiative return: emission of $\\\\rho^+$ from the\\ninitial state converts the incident $e^+$ into $\\\\bar\\\\nu_e$. Likewise, the CP\\nconjugate channel, $\\\\nu_e e^+\\\\rightarrow W^+$, takes the form\\n$e^+e^-\\\\rightarrow W^+\\\\rho(770)^-$. Similar reactions with muons are also\\npossible. Within this viewpoint, future high-luminosity lepton colliders seem\\nto be promising for excitation of the Glashow resonance in laboratory\\nconditions.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T17:58:20Z\"}"}
