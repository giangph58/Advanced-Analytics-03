{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05771v1\", \"title\": \"Dissolution-driven transport in a rotating horizontal cylinder\", \"summary\": \"Dissolution, in particular, coupled with convection, can be of great\\nrelevance in the fields of pharmaceuticals, food science, chemical engineering,\\nand environmental science, having applications in drug release into the\\nbloodstream, ingredient dissolution in liquids, metal extraction from ores, and\\npollutant dispersion in water. We study the combined effects of natural\\nconvection and rotation on the dissolution of a solute in a solvent-filled\\ncircular cylinder. The density of the fluid increases with the increasing\\nconcentration of the dissolved solute, and we model this using the\\nOberbeck-Boussinesq approximation. The underlying moving-boundary problem has\\nbeen modelled by combining Navier-Stokes equations with the advection-diffusion\\nequation and a Stefan condition for the evolving solute-fluid interface. We use\\nhighly resolved numerical simulations to investigate the flow regimes,\\ndissolution rates, and mixing of the dissolved solute for $Sc = 1$, $Ra =\\n[10^5, 10^8]$ and $\\\\Omega = [0, 2.5]$. In the absence of rotation and buoyancy,\\nthe distance of the interface from its initial position follows a square root\\nrelationship with time ($r_d \\\\propto \\\\sqrt{t}$), which ceases to exist at a\\nlater time due to the finite-size effect of the liquid domain. We then explore\\nthe rotation parameter, considering a range of rotation frequency -- from\\nsmaller to larger, relative to the inverse of the buoyancy-induced timescale --\\nand Rayleigh number. We show that the area of the dissolved solute varies\\nnonlinearly with time depending on $Ra$ and $\\\\Omega$. The symmetry breaking of\\nthe interface is best described in terms of $Ra/\\\\Omega^2$.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T07:50:30Z\"}"}
