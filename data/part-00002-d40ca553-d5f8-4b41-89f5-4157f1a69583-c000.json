{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01709v1\", \"title\": \"How chiral vibrations drive molecular rotation\", \"summary\": \"We analyze two simple model planar molecules: an ionic molecule with D3\\nsymmetry and a covalent molecule with D6 symmetry. Both symmetries allow the\\nexistence of chiral molecular orbitals and normal modes that are coupled to\\neach other in a Jahn-Teller manner, invariant under U (1) symmetry with\\ngenerator a pseudo angular momentum. In the ionic molecule, the chiral mode\\npossesses an electric dipole but lacks physical angular momentum, whereas, in\\nthe covalent molecule, the situation is reversed. In spite of that, we show\\nthat in both cases the chiral modes can be excited by a circularly polarized\\nlight and are subsequently able to induce rotational motion of the entire\\nmolecule. We further discuss the potential extension of our findings to the\\ncase of crystalline bulk samples.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T13:15:59Z\"}"}
