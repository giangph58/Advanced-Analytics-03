{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04943v1\", \"title\": \"Emergence of microbial host dormancy during a persistent virus epidemic\", \"summary\": \"We study a minimal stochastic individual-based model for a microbial\\npopulation challenged by a persistent (lytic) virus epidemic. We focus on the\\nsituation in which the resident microbial host population and the virus\\npopulation are in stable coexistence upon arrival of a single new ``mutant''\\nhost individual. We assume that this mutant is capable of switching to a\\nreversible state of dormancy upon contact with virions as a means of avoiding\\ninfection by the virus. At the same time, we assume that this new dormancy\\ntrait comes with a cost, namely a reduced individual reproduction rate. We\\nprove that there is a non-trivial range of parameters where the mutants can\\nnevertheless invade the resident population with strictly positive probability\\n(bounded away from 0) in the large population limit. Given the reduced\\nreproductive rate, such an invasion would be impossible in the absence of\\neither the dormancy trait or the virus epidemic. We explicitly characterize the\\nparameter regime where this emergence of a (costly) host dormancy trait is\\npossible, determine the success probability of a single invader and the typical\\namount of time it takes the successful mutants to reach a macroscopic\\npopulation size. We conclude this study by an investigation of the fate of the\\npopulation after the successful emergence of a dormancy trait. Heuristic\\narguments and simulations suggest that after successful invasion, either both\\nhost types and the virus will reach coexistence, or the mutants will drive the\\nresident hosts to extinction while the virus will stay in the system.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:30:42Z\"}"}
