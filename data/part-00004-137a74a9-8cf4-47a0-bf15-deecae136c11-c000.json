Our calculation reproduces the fast equator and near-surface\\nshear layer (NSSL) of differential rotation and the near-surface poleward\\nmeridional flow simultaneously. The NSSL is located in a complex layer where\\nthe spatial and time scales of thermal convection are significantly small\\ncompared with the deep convection zone. While there have been several attempts\\nto reproduce the NSSL in numerical simulation, the results are still far from\\nreality. In this study, we succeed in reproducing an NSSL in our new\\ncalculation. Our analyses lead to a deeper understanding of the construction\\nmechanism of the NSSL, which is summarized as: 1) rotationally unconstrained\\nconvection in the near-surface layer transports the angular momentum radially\\ninward; 2) sheared poleward meridional flow around the top boundary is\\nconstructed; 3) the shear causes a positive kinetic $\\\\langle v'_r\\nv'_\\\\theta\\\\rangle$ and negative magnetic $\\\\langle B_r B_\\\\theta\\\\rangle$\\ncorrelations; and 4) the turbulent viscosity and magnetic tension are\\nlatitudinally balanced with the Coriolis force in the NSSL. We emphasize the\\nimportance of the magnetic field in the solar convection zone.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T04:44:37Z\"}"}
