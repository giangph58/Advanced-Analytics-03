The model action\\nis built from a single scalar field with a canonical kinetic term without any\\npotential or Lagrange multiplier terms. The coupling to gravity is realized\\nthrough a particular transverse diffeomorphism invariant volume element. The\\ncorresponding sound speed is exactly zero in any background geometry and the\\nmodel is dynamically identical to $\\\\Lambda$CDM. By restoring the full\\ndiffeomorphism invariance through the introduction of Stueckelberg-like fields,\\nwe obtain an equivalent local scalar-vector theory.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T12:43:15Z\"}"}
