We show that the\\nstudy of this problem can be reduced to that of a random matrix model whose\\nspectral analysis gives access to the reconstruction performance. These results\\nshed light on and specify the loss of performance induced by an artificial\\nreduction of the memory cost of a tensor via the deletion of a random part of\\nits entries.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ML\", \"categories\": \"stat.ML,cs.LG,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:57:09Z\"}"}
