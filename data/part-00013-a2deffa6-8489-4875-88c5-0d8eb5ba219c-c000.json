We review the gauge-theoretic approach of gravities, commenting\\nin particular on their diffeomorphism invariance, and the construction of\\nconformal and noncommutative (fuzzy) gravity using the gauge-theoretic\\nframework. Based on an extension of the four-dimensional tangent group,\\nunification of both gravities with the internal interactions is achieved. Both\\nunified schemes are examined at 1-loop level considering suitable spontaneous\\nsymmetry breakings to a SO(10) grand unified theory and consequently down to\\nthe Standard Model of particle physics through four specific spontaneous\\nbreaking channels. Each channel is examined against proton lifetime\\nexperimental bounds and its observation potential through gravitational signal\\nfrom cosmic strings production is discussed.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T15:38:33Z\"}"}
