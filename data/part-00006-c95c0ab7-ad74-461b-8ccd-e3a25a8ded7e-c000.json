{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07462v1\", \"title\": \"Learning Universal Features for Generalizable Image Forgery Localization\", \"summary\": \"In recent years, advanced image editing and generation methods have rapidly\\nevolved, making detecting and locating forged image content increasingly\\nchallenging. Most existing image forgery detection methods rely on identifying\\nthe edited traces left in the image. However, because the traces of different\\nforgeries are distinct, these methods can identify familiar forgeries included\\nin the training data but struggle to handle unseen ones. In response, we\\npresent an approach for Generalizable Image Forgery Localization (GIFL). Once\\ntrained, our model can detect both seen and unseen forgeries, providing a more\\npractical and efficient solution to counter false information in the era of\\ngenerative AI. Our method focuses on learning general features from the\\npristine content rather than traces of specific forgeries, which are relatively\\nconsistent across different types of forgeries and therefore can be used as\\nuniversal features to locate unseen forgeries. Additionally, as existing image\\nforgery datasets are still dominated by traditional hand-crafted forgeries, we\\nconstruct a new dataset consisting of images edited by various popular deep\\ngenerative image editing methods to further encourage research in detecting\\nimages manipulated by deep generative models. Extensive experimental results\\nshow that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the\\ndetection of unseen forgeries and also demonstrates competitive results for\\nseen forgeries. The code and dataset are available at\\nhttps://github.com/ZhaoHengrun/GIFL.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T05:20:29Z\"}"}
