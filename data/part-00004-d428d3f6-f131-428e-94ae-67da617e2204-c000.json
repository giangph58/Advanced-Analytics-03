To investigate the\\ncause of the observed transitions, we present new contemporaneous optical and\\nX-ray observations of three faded changing-look quasars as they return to the\\nhigh state. Two of these three faded changing-look quasars remained in a\\nquiescent state for more than ten years before returning to a new high state.\\nWe find that before, during, and after transition, the spectral energy\\ndistributions of all three follow predictions for quasars based on X-ray binary\\noutbursts, suggesting that the mechanism for the change is likely a changing\\naccretion rate causing changes in the accretion flow structure. We also find\\nthat, in two of the three cases, the transition between the initial high and\\nlow state and the transition between the low and new high state took nearly\\nidentical amounts of time, on the order of hundreds of days. This transition\\ntimescale is useful for testing theoretical models that attempt to explain the\\nshort time scale for the state transition.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:08:39Z\"}"}
