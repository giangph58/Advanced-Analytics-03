{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04910v1\", \"title\": \"Fault Localisation in Infinite-Dimensional Linear Electrical Networks\", \"summary\": \"We present a novel fault localisation methodology for linear time-invariant\\nelectrical networks with infinite-dimensional edge dynamics and uncertain fault\\ndynamics. The theory accommodates instability and also bounded propagation\\ndelays in the network. The goal is to estimate the location of a fault along a\\ngiven network edge, using sensors positioned arbitrarily throughout the\\nnetwork. Passive faults of unknown impedance are considered, along with stable\\nfaults of known impedance. To illustrate the approach, we tackle a significant\\nuse-case: a multi-conductor transmission line, with dynamics modelled by the\\nTelegrapher's equation, subject to a line-to-ground fault. Frequency-domain\\ninsights are used to reformulate the general fault localisation problem into a\\nnon-convex scalar optimisation problem, of which the true fault location is\\nguaranteed to be a global minimiser. Numerical experiments are run to quantify\\nlocalisation performance over a range of fault resistances.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY,eess.SP,math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T10:40:25Z\"}"}
