{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23939v1\", \"title\": \"Simulation of Shor algorithm for discrete logarithm problems with\\n  comprehensive pairs of modulo p and order q\", \"summary\": \"The discrete logarithm problem (DLP) over finite fields, commonly used in\\nclassical cryptography, has no known polynomial-time algorithm on classical\\ncomputers. However, Shor has provided its polynomial-time algorithm on quantum\\ncomputers. Nevertheless, there are only few examples simulating quantum\\ncircuits that operate on general pairs of modulo $p$ and order $q$. In this\\npaper, we constructed such quantum circuits and solved DLPs for all 1,860\\npossible pairs of $p$ and $q$ up to 32 qubits using a quantum simulator with\\nPRIMEHPC FX700. From this, we obtained and verified values of the success\\nprobabilities, which had previously been heuristically analyzed by Eker\\\\r{a}.\\nAs a result, we found that the success probability of Shor's algorithm for\\nsolving the DLP exhibits periodicity with an asymmetric waveform determined by\\nthe order $q$. Additionally, we generated 1,015 quantum circuits for larger\\npairs of $p$ and $q$, extrapolated the circuit sizes obtained, and compared\\nthem for $p=2048$ bits between safe-prime groups and Schnorr groups. While in\\nclassical cryptography, the cipher strength of safe-prime groups and Schnorr\\ngroups is the same if $p$ is equal, we quantitatively demonstrated how much the\\nstrength of the latter decreases to the bit length of $p$ in the former when\\nusing Shor's quantum algorithm. In particular, it was experimentally and\\ntheoretically shown that when a ripple carry adder is used in the addition\\ncircuit, the cryptographic strength of a Schnorr group with $p=2048$ bits under\\nShor's algorithm is almost equivalent to that of a safe-prime group with\\n$p=1024$ bits.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T10:39:10Z\"}"}
