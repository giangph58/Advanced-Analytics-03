While biology makes use of spikes to seamless use\\nboth spike timing and mean firing rate to modulate synaptic strength, most\\nmodels focus on one of the two. In this work, we present a Hebbian local\\nlearning rule that models synaptic modification as a function of calcium traces\\ntracking neuronal activity. We show how the rule reproduces results from spike\\ntime and spike rate protocols from neuroscientific studies. Moreover, we use\\nthe model to train spiking neural networks on MNIST digit recognition to show\\nand explain what sort of mechanisms are needed to learn real-world patterns. We\\nshow how our model is sensitive to correlated spiking activity and how this\\nenables it to modulate the learning rate of the network without altering the\\nmean firing rate of the neurons nor the hyparameters of the learning rule. To\\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first work that showcases how spike\\ntiming and rate can be complementary in their role of shaping the connectivity\\nof spiking neural networks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NE\", \"categories\": \"cs.NE,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T11:39:59Z\"}"}
