This tendency can enhance the rates of fundamental\\nprocesses such as atom-atom and atom-light scattering if the atoms scatter into\\nalready occupied quantum states. For non-interacting bosons, the enhancement of\\nlight scattering is simply given by the bosonic-stimulation factor $1 + N_{\\\\rm\\nf}$, where $N_{\\\\rm f}$ is the occupation of the atom's final momentum state.\\nHere, we study scattering between off-resonant light and atoms in a\\nquasi-homogeneous Bose gas with tunable interactions and show that even weak\\ninteractions, which do not significantly alter the momentum distribution, have\\na dramatic effect on the atom-light scattering. Due to (spatially local)\\nbeyond-mean-field atomic correlations, weak repulsive interactions can\\ncompletely suppress the bosonic enhancement of scattering, while attractive\\nones increase the scattering rate. Moreover, if the interactions are rapidly\\ntuned, light scattering reveals correlation dynamics that are orders of\\nmagnitude faster than the momentum-space population dynamics. Its extreme\\nsensitivity to dynamical beyond-mean-field effects makes off-resonant light\\nscattering a simple and powerful probe of many-body physics in ultracold atomic\\ngases.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas,physics.atom-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:59:48Z\"}"}
