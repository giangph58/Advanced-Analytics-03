Fouling, the gradual accumulation of solids on heat transfer\\nsurfaces, causes a time-varying decrease in the overall heat transfer\\ncoefficient (U(t)), significantly impacting the efficiency of heat transfer.\\nGood estimation and modeling of fouling (the heat transfer coefficient) will\\nlead to better fouling mitigation strategies. This study investigates the\\nidentifiability of the time-varying $U(t)$ in HEXs from closed-loop operational\\ndata, without external excitation of reference signals or knowledge of the\\ncontroller parameters. We establish that while the complete system model cannot\\nbe identified under these given constraints, the time-varying heat transfer\\ncoefficient $U(t)$ remains identifiable. Further, we propose a neural network\\nbased architecture, called (Per-PINN), for estimation and modeling the heat\\ntransfer coefficient from the closed-loop system data. This Per-PINN model is\\nshown to perform better than the existing Physics-Informed Neural Networks\\n(PINN) based models for inverse parameter learning as it inherently fixes the\\nunderlying physical equations and learns only the time-varying parameter U(t).\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T17:31:46Z\"}"}
