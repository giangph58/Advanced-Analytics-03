{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05268v1\", \"title\": \"Performance and Complexity Analysis of Terahertz-Band MIMO Detection\", \"summary\": \"Achieving terabit-per-second (Tbps) data rates in terahertz (THz)-band\\ncommunications requires bridging the complexity gap in baseband transceiver\\ndesign. This work addresses the signal processing challenges associated with\\ndata detection in THz multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. We begin\\nby analyzing the trade-offs between performance and complexity across various\\ndetection schemes and THz channel models, demonstrating significant complexity\\nreduction by leveraging spatial parallelizability over subspaces of correlated\\nTHz MIMO channels. We derive accurate detection error probability bounds by\\naccounting for THz-specific channel models and mismatches introduced by\\nsubspace decomposition. Building on this, we propose a subspace detector that\\nintegrates layer sorting, QR decomposition, and channel-matrix puncturing to\\nbalance performance loss and parallelizability. Furthermore, we introduce a\\nchannel-matrix reuse strategy for wideband THz MIMO detection. Simulations over\\naccurate, ill-conditioned THz channels show that efficient parallelizability\\nachieves multi-dB performance gains, while wideband reuse strategies offer\\ncomputational savings with minimal performance degradation.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T17:06:07Z\"}"}
