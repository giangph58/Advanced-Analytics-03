We solve the\\nVlasov-Fokker-Planck (VFP) equation for various mixes of mirroring and\\nsmall-angle scattering and show that relatively small deviations from a uniform\\nmagnetic field can induce mirroring and inhibit CR transport to levels that\\nmimic Bohm diffusion in which the CR mean free path is comparable with the CR\\nLarmor radius. Our calculations suggest that shocks may accelerate CR to the\\nHillas (1984) energy without the need for magnetic field amplification on the\\nLarmor scale. This re-opens the possibility, subject to more comprehensive\\nsimulations, that young supernova remnants may be accelerating CR to PeV\\nenergies, and maybe even to higher energies beyond the knee in the energy\\nspectrum. We limit our discussion of CR acceleration to shocks that are\\nnon-relativistic.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T15:38:17Z\"}"}
