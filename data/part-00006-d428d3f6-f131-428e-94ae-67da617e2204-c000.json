{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06067v1\", \"title\": \"GPU-accelerated Evolutionary Many-objective Optimization Using\\n  Tensorized NSGA-III\", \"summary\": \"NSGA-III is one of the most widely adopted algorithms for tackling\\nmany-objective optimization problems. However, its CPU-based design severely\\nlimits scalability and computational efficiency. To address the limitations, we\\npropose {TensorNSGA-III}, a fully tensorized implementation of NSGA-III that\\nleverages GPU parallelism for large-scale many-objective optimization. Unlike\\nconventional GPU-accelerated evolutionary algorithms that rely on heuristic\\napproximations to improve efficiency, TensorNSGA-III maintains the exact\\nselection and variation mechanisms of NSGA-III while achieving significant\\nacceleration. By reformulating the selection process with tensorized data\\nstructures and an optimized caching strategy, our approach effectively\\neliminates computational bottlenecks inherent in traditional CPU-based and\\nna\\\\\\\"ive GPU implementations. Experimental results on widely used numerical\\nbenchmarks show that TensorNSGA-III achieves speedups of up to $3629\\\\times$\\nover the CPU version of NSGA-III. Additionally, we validate its effectiveness\\nin multiobjective robotic control tasks, where it discovers diverse and\\nhigh-quality behavioral solutions. Furthermore, we investigate the critical\\nrole of large population sizes in many-objective optimization and demonstrate\\nthe scalability of TensorNSGA-III in such scenarios.
