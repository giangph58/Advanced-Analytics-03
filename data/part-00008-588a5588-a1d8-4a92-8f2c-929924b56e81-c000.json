The model demonstrates that\\nthe quality factor of plasmonic resonances could be increased by using ungated\\nregions with high electron densities connecting multiple plasmonic cavities.\\nThe analytical and numerical calculations of the EM radiation absorption by the\\nband plasmons show that the drive current makes all plasma modes optically\\nactive by breaking the symmetry of the plasma oscillations. This effect results\\nin splitting plasmon resonant absorption peaks revealing the gaps in the\\nplasmonic band spectrum tunable by current. The analyzed design could achieve\\nresonant behavior at room temperature for plasmonic crystals implemented in\\nvarious material systems, including graphene, III-V, III-N materials, and\\np-diamond. We argue that the resulting double-peak spectrum line in the\\nterahertz range also facilitates the absorption at the gap frequency, typically\\nin microwave range. Power pumping at the gap frequency enables excitation of\\nthe gap plasmons, promoting frequency conversion from microwave to THz ranges.\\nThe flexibility in the length of the ungated region for the investigated\\nstructures allows for an effective coupling with THz radiation, with the metal\\ngrating acting as a distributive resonant antenna. The applications of the\\npresented results extend to THz communication systems, THz sensing and imaging,\\nfrequency conversion systems, and other advanced THz plasmonic devices.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T03:30:41Z\"}"}
