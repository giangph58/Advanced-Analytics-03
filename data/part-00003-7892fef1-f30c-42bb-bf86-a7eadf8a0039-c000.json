This work reviews novel covariant formulations designed to\\ngenerate arbitrary interacting duality-invariant or chiral (self-dual) $p$-form\\ntheories in $d = 2p + 2$ space-time dimensions. For odd $p$, such theories\\npossess $\\\\mathsf{U}(1)$ duality invariance and include the Born-Infeld and\\nModMax theories. For even $p$, they describe a self-interacting chiral $p$-form\\nwith its gauge-invariant field strength obeying a nonlinear self-duality\\ncondition. We provide a complete description of $T\\\\bar T$-like deformations of\\n$\\\\mathsf{U}(1)$ duality-invariant models for nonlinear electrodynamics in four\\ndimensions and their six-dimensional counterparts -- interacting chiral\\ntwo-form field theories. We also elaborate on consistent flows in the spaces of\\nduality-invariant or chiral (self-dual) $p$-form theories beyond six\\ndimensions.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T07:12:51Z\"}"}
