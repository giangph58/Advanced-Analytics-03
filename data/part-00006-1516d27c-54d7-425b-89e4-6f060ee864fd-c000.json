{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02233v1\", \"title\": \"Testing independence and conditional independence in high dimensions via\\n  coordinatewise Gaussianization\", \"summary\": \"We propose new statistical tests, in high-dimensional settings, for testing\\nthe independence of two random vectors and their conditional independence given\\na third random vector. The key idea is simple, i.e., we first transform each\\ncomponent variable to standard normal via its marginal empirical distribution,\\nand we then test for independence and conditional independence of the\\ntransformed random vectors using appropriate $L_\\\\infty$-type test statistics.\\nWhile we are testing some necessary conditions of the independence or the\\nconditional independence, the new tests outperform the 13 frequently used\\ntesting methods in a large scale simulation comparison. The advantage of the\\nnew tests can be summarized as follows: (i) they do not require any moment\\nconditions, (ii) they allow arbitrary dependence structures of the components\\namong the random vectors, and (iii) they allow the dimensions of random vectors\\ndiverge at the exponential rates of the sample size. The critical values of the\\nproposed tests are determined by a computationally efficient multiplier\\nbootstrap procedure. Theoretical analysis shows that the sizes of the proposed\\ntests can be well controlled by the nominal significance level, and the\\nproposed tests are also consistent under certain local alternatives. The finite\\nsample performance of the new tests is illustrated via extensive simulation\\nstudies and a real data application.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T02:59:52Z\"}"}
