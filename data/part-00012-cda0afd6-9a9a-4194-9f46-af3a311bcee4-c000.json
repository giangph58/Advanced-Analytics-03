{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01554v1\", \"title\": \"8-DoFs Cable Driven Parallel Robots for Bimanual Teleportation\", \"summary\": \"Teleoperation plays a critical role in intuitive robot control and imitation\\nlearning, particularly for complex tasks involving mobile manipulators with\\nredundant degrees of freedom (DoFs). However, most existing master controllers\\nare limited to 6-DoF spatial control and basic gripper control, making them\\ninsufficient for controlling high-DoF robots and restricting the operator to a\\nsmall workspace. In this work, we present a novel, low-cost, high-DoF master\\ncontroller based on Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs), designed to overcome\\nthese limitations. The system decouples translation and orientation control,\\nfollowing a scalable 3 + 3 + n DoF structure: 3 DoFs for large-range\\ntranslation using a CDPR, 3 DoFs for orientation using a gimbal mechanism, and\\nn additional DoFs for gripper and redundant joint control. Its lightweight\\ncable-driven design enables a large and adaptable workspace while minimizing\\nactuator load. The end-effector remains stable without requiring continuous\\nhigh-torque input, unlike most serial robot arms. We developed the first\\ndual-arm CDPR-based master controller using cost-effective actuators and a\\nsimple mechanical structure. In demonstrations, the system successfully\\ncontrolled an 8-DoF robotic arm with a 2-DoF pan-tilt camera, performing tasks\\nsuch as pick-and-place, knot tying, object sorting, and tape application. The\\nresults show precise, versatile, and practical high-DoF teleoperation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T09:54:16Z\"}"}
