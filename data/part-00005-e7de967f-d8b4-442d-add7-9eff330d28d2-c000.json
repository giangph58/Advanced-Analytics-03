Take the example of spoken language, which is\\ncharacterised by a highly variable and complex set of physical movements that\\nmap onto the small set of cognitive units that comprise language. What are the\\nfundamental dynamical principles behind the movements that structure speech\\nproduction? In this study, we discover models in the form of symbolic equations\\nthat govern articulatory gestures during speech. A sparse symbolic regression\\nalgorithm is used to discover models from kinematic data on the tongue and\\nlips. We explore these candidate models using analytical techniques and\\nnumerical simulations, and find that a second-order linear model achieves high\\nlevels of accuracy, but a nonlinear force is required to properly model\\narticulatory dynamics in approximately one third of cases. This supports the\\nproposal that an autonomous, nonlinear, second-order differential equation is a\\nviable dynamical law for articulatory gestures in speech. We conclude by\\nidentifying future opportunities and obstacles in data-driven model discovery\\nand outline prospects for discovering the dynamical principles that govern\\nlanguage, brain and behaviour.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,nlin.AO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T09:03:32Z\"}"}
