Minicrypt in a Quantum World\", \"summary\": \"We prove that it is impossible to construct perfect-complete quantum\\npublic-key encryption (QPKE) with classical keys from quantumly secure one-way\\nfunctions (OWFs) in a black-box manner, resolving a long-standing open question\\nin quantum cryptography. Specifically, in the quantum random oracle model\\n(QROM), no perfect-complete QPKE scheme with classical keys, and\\nclassical/quantum ciphertext can be secure. This improves the previous works\\nwhich require either unproven conjectures or imposed restrictions on key\\ngeneration algorithms. This impossibility even extends to QPKE with quantum\\npublic key if the public key can be uniquely determined by the secret key, and\\nthus is tight to all existing QPKE constructions.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T06:07:40Z\"}"}
