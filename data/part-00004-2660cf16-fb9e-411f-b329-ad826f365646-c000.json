{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04811v1\", \"title\": \"Cross-Frame OTFS Parameter Estimation Based On Chinese Remainder Theorem\", \"summary\": \"Orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) is a potential waveform for integrated\\nsensing and communications (ISAC) systems because it can manage communication\\nand sensing metrics in one unified domain, and has better performance in high\\nmobility scenarios. In practice, a target might come from far distance or with\\nultra-high speed. However, the max unambiguous range and max tolerable velocity\\nof OTFS-ISAC system is limited by the unambiguous round-trip delay and Doppler\\nshift, which are related to OTFS frame, i.e., time slots and subcarrier\\nspacing, respectively. To enlarge the sensing range, a novel OTFS cross-frame\\nranging and velocity estimation model as well as its corresponding method based\\non the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) are proposed in this paper. By designing\\nco-prime numbers of subcarriers and time slots in different subframes, the\\ndifference in the responses of the subframes for a target can be used to\\nestimate the distance and velocity of an out-of-range target. Several frame\\nstructures are further designed for specific sensing scenarios, such as target\\nwith ultra-high speed or at far distance. Simulation results show that the\\nproposed method can achieve significantly better performance in NMSE compared\\nwith the classic sensing methods under the condition of same time and frequency\\nresources.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T08:05:32Z\"}"}
