{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24069v1\", \"title\": \"Impact of Amplitude and Phase Damping Noise on Quantum Reinforcement\\n  Learning: Challenges and Opportunities\", \"summary\": \"Quantum machine learning (QML) is an emerging field with significant\\npotential, yet it remains highly susceptible to noise, which poses a major\\nchallenge to its practical implementation. While various noise mitigation\\nstrategies have been proposed to enhance algorithmic performance, the impact of\\nnoise is not fully understood. In this work, we investigate the effects of\\namplitude and phase damping noise on a quantum reinforcement learning\\nalgorithm. Through analytical and numerical analysis, we assess how these noise\\nsources influence the learning process and overall performance. Our findings\\ncontribute to a deeper understanding of the role of noise in quantum learning\\nalgorithms and suggest that, rather than being purely detrimental, unavoidable\\nnoise may present opportunities to enhance QML processes.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:27:30Z\"}"}
