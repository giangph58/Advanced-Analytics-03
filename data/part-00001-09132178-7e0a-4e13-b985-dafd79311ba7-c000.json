This paper\\nproposes a novel approach leveraging fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to\\nenhance smart contract vulnerability detection. We introduce a comprehensive\\ndataset of 215 real-world DApp projects (4,998 contracts), including\\nhard-to-detect logical errors like token price manipulation, addressing the\\nlimitations of existing simplified benchmarks. By fine-tuning LLMs (Llama3-8B\\nand Qwen2-7B) with Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning (FFT) and Low-Rank Adaptation\\n(LoRA), our method achieves superior performance, attaining an F1-score of 0.83\\nwith FFT and data augmentation via Random Over Sampling (ROS). Comparative\\nexperiments demonstrate significant improvements over prompt-based LLMs and\\nstate-of-the-art tools. Notably, the approach excels in detecting\\nnon-machine-auditable vulnerabilities, achieving 0.97 precision and 0.68 recall\\nfor price manipulation flaws. The results underscore the effectiveness of\\ndomain-specific LLM fine-tuning and data augmentation in addressing real-world\\nDApp security challenges, offering a robust solution for blockchain ecosystem\\nprotection.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:32:14Z\"}"}
