In this work, we establish a theoretical framework\\nto predict the fundamental limits of intensity enhancement with phase-only\\nmodulation in the presence of noise-induced phase errors, and we experimentally\\ndemonstrate wavefront shaping that approaches these limits. Our experimental\\nresults confirm an enhancement factor of 5,000 in a large-core multimode fiber,\\napproaching the theoretical upper bound, enabled by noise-tolerant wavefront\\nshaping. These findings provide key insights into the limits of phase-only\\ncontrol in multimode fibers, with profound implications for single-fiber\\nimaging, optical communication, high-power broad-area fiber amplification, and\\nbeyond.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T10:24:08Z\"}"}
