Multiple\\ntheoretical studies on the $\\\\nu=\\\\frac{12}{5}$ FQH state predict various\\nquasi-particle states hosted by the $\\\\frac{12}{5}$ plateau, which include\\n$\\\\mathbb Z_3$ parafermions and Majorana modes. In this work, we provide a\\nsystematic protocol to distinguish among four possible candidate wavefunctions\\nof the $\\\\frac{12}{5}$ plateau using zero-frequency short noise experiments on a\\nfilter-geometry. Qualitative comparisons of Fano-Factors provide a robust way\\nto predict the candidate state across both the full and partial thermal\\nequilibration regimes without prior knowledge of the experimental information,\\nlike thermal equilibration length, to allow for more realistic experiments.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T17:13:55Z\"}"}
