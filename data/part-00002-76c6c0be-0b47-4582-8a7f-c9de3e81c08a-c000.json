{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06595v1\", \"title\": \"Time-local stochastic equation of motion for solid ionic electrolytes\", \"summary\": \"Numerical studies of ionic motion through solid electrolytes commonly involve\\nstatic nudged-elastic band (NEB) methods or costly \\\\emph{ab initio} molecular\\ndynamics (AIMD). Building on a time-local model of current carrier-electrolyte\\ninteraction and incorporating thermal motion, we introduce an approach that is\\nintermediate between the two well-established methodologies by treating the\\nelectrolyte as an effective medium that interacts with the mobile particle.\\nThrough this coupling, the thermally vibrating electrolyte imparts energy to\\nthe charge carriers while also absorbing energy from them due to its own finite\\nelasticity. Using a simple model system, we validate our approach through a\\nseries of numerical simulations. Our methodology reproduces both dissipative\\nand diffusive behavior, and helps link microscopic system parameters to\\nmeasurable macroscopic properties.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T05:45:10Z\"}"}
