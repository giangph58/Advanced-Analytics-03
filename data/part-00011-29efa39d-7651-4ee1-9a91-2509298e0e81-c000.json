However, many existing co-creative AI tools cannot communicate\\neffectively, limiting their potential as collaborators. This paper introduces\\nour initial design of a Framework for designing AI Communication (FAICO) for\\nco-creative AI based on a systematic review of 107 full-length papers. FAICO\\npresents key aspects of AI communication and their impacts on user experience\\nto guide the design of effective AI communication. We then show actionable ways\\nto translate our framework into two practical tools: design cards for designers\\nand a configuration tool for users. The design cards enable designers to\\nconsider AI communication strategies that cater to a diverse range of users in\\nco-creative contexts, while the configuration tool empowers users to customize\\nAI communication based on their needs and creative workflows. This paper\\ncontributes new insights within the literature on human-AI co-creativity and\\nHuman-Computer Interaction, focusing on designing AI communication to enhance\\nuser experience.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T12:29:53Z\"}"}
