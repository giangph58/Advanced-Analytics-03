Thus, it is extremely time consuming\\nand labor intensive. In this paper, a novel machine-learning-based framework is\\nproposed to tackle this issue. It integrates artificial neural networks with a\\nself-adaptive differential evolution algorithm (ANNs-SaDE). This framework\\nenables the self-adaptive design of various types of microwave branch-line\\ncouplers by precisely optimizing essential electrical properties, such as\\ncoupling factor, isolation, and phase difference between output ports. The\\neffectiveness of the ANNs-SaDE framework is demonstrated by the designs of\\nfolded single-stage branch-line couplers and multi-stage wideband branch-line\\ncouplers.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T06:58:29Z\"}"}
