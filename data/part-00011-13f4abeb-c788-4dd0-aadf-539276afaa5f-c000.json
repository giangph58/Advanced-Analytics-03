Firstly, we regard the effect of the\\nelectric field on the magnon through the AC effect as a perturbation. Then we\\nderived the expressions of MSPC and MEPC in two-dimensional collinear\\nferromagnetic system. And we apply our theory to the two-dimension\\nferromagnetic Hexagonal and Kagome lattice. We find that the optical frequency\\nand the relaxation time of the material can be used to control the\\nphoto-transport of magnons. In addition, under the condition of low light\\nfrequncy and infinite relaxation time, the longitudinal magnon photo-transport\\nis related to the topological property of the magnon system.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:06:39Z\"}"}
