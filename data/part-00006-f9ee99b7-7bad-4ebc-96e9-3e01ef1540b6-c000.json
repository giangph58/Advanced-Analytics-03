In this letter, we propose an Adaptive Extended Kalman\\nFilter (AEKF) for SoC estimation using a covariance adaptation technique based\\non maximum likelihood estimation - a novelty in this domain. Furthermore, we\\ntune a key design parameter - the window size - to obtain an optimal\\nmemory-performance trade-off, and experimentally demonstrate our solution\\nachieves superior estimation accuracy with respect to existing alternative\\nmethods. Finally, we present a fully custom implementation of the AEKF for a\\ngeneral-purpose low-cost STM32 microcontroller, showing it can be deployed with\\nminimal computational requirements adequate for real-world usage.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T11:50:14Z\"}"}
