{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05730v1\", \"title\": \"Unified Generative Search and Recommendation\", \"summary\": \"Modern commercial platforms typically offer both search and recommendation\\nfunctionalities to serve diverse user needs, making joint modeling of these\\ntasks an appealing direction. While prior work has shown that integrating\\nsearch and recommendation can be mutually beneficial, it also reveals a\\nperformance trade-off: enhancements in one task often come at the expense of\\nthe other. This challenge arises from their distinct information requirements:\\nsearch emphasizes semantic relevance between queries and items, whereas\\nrecommendation depends more on collaborative signals among users and items.\\nEffectively addressing this trade-off requires tackling two key problems: (1)\\nintegrating both semantic and collaborative signals into item representations,\\nand (2) guiding the model to distinguish and adapt to the unique demands of\\nsearch and recommendation. The emergence of generative retrieval with Large\\nLanguage Models (LLMs) presents new possibilities. This paradigm encodes items\\nas identifiers and frames both search and recommendation as sequential\\ngeneration tasks, offering the flexibility to leverage multiple identifiers and\\ntask-specific prompts. In light of this, we introduce GenSAR, a unified\\ngenerative framework for balanced search and recommendation. Our approach\\ndesigns dual-purpose identifiers and tailored training strategies to\\nincorporate complementary signals and align with task-specific objectives.\\nExperiments on both public and commercial datasets demonstrate that GenSAR\\neffectively reduces the trade-off and achieves state-of-the-art performance on\\nboth tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T07:03:08Z\"}"}
