Given the small binding\\nbetween layers, exploitation for engineering will require a breakthrough in\\nstacking methodology, or an ability to take advantage of thicker defective\\nstacks. Here we describe computational groundwork for the latter, using -- on\\naccount of its promise for cold memory applications -- 1$T$-TaS$_2$ as a model\\nsystem. Comparing recursive Hendricks-Teller calculations and Monte Carlo\\nsimulations to published X-ray diffraction data, we obtain the key parameters\\ndescribing the random stacking in mesoscopic flakes. These then regulate the\\nelectronic structures via specification of the random stacks in dynamical\\nmean-field theory simulations. Hubbard repulsion induces strongly correlated\\nmetallic, band and Mott insulating layers, providing compelling evidence that\\nelectronic properties follow from the coexistence of more than the metallic and\\ninsulating planes associated by ordinary band theory.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:09:14Z\"}"}
