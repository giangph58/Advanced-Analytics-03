To address this challenge, we introduce an LLM-based agentic\\nAI system that integrates contextual retrieval, fine-tuning, and multi-step\\nreasoning to extract relevant financial data, classify investments, and ensure\\ncompliance with funding guidelines. Our study focuses on a real-world\\napplication: tracking EWS investments in the Climate Risk and Early Warning\\nSystems (CREWS) Fund. We analyze 25 MDB project documents and evaluate multiple\\nAI-driven classification methods, including zero-shot and few-shot learning,\\nfine-tuned transformer-based classifiers, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, and\\nan agent-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach. Our results show\\nthat the agent-based RAG approach significantly outperforms other methods,\\nachieving 87\\\\% accuracy, 89\\\\% precision, and 83\\\\% recall. Additionally, we\\ncontribute a benchmark dataset and expert-annotated corpus, providing a\\nvaluable resource for future research in AI-driven financial tracking and\\nclimate finance transparency.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:11:11Z\"}"}
