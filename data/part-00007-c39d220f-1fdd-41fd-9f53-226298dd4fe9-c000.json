{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07562v1\", \"title\": \"ReXCL: A Tool for Requirement Document Extraction and Classification\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents the ReXCL tool, which automates the extraction and\\nclassification processes in requirement engineering, enhancing the software\\ndevelopment lifecycle. The tool features two main modules: Extraction, which\\nprocesses raw requirement documents into a predefined schema using heuristics\\nand predictive modeling, and Classification, which assigns class labels to\\nrequirements using adaptive fine-tuning of encoder-based models. The final\\noutput can be exported to external requirement engineering tools. Performance\\nevaluations indicate that ReXCL significantly improves efficiency and accuracy\\nin managing requirements, marking a novel approach to automating the\\nschematization of semi-structured requirement documents.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T08:46:54Z\"}"}
