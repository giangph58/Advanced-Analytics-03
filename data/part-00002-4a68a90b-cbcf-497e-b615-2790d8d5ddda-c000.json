However, crosstalk from concurrent two-qubit CNOT gates poses\\nsecurity risks, compromising the fidelity and output of co-running victim\\nprograms. We design Zero Knowledge Tampering Attacks (ZKTAs), using which\\nattackers can exploit crosstalk without knowledge of the hardware error\\nprofile. ZKTAs can alter victim program outputs in 40% of cases on commercial\\nsystems.\\n  We identify that ZKTAs succeed because the attacker's program consistently\\nruns with the same victim program in a fixed context. To mitigate this, we\\npropose QONTEXTS: a context-switching technique that defends against ZKTAs by\\nrunning programs across multiple contexts, each handling only a subset of\\ntrials. QONTEXTS uses multi-programming with frequent context switching while\\nidentifying a unique set of programs for each context. This helps limit only a\\nfraction of execution to ZKTAs. We enhance QONTEXTS with attack detection\\ncapabilities that compare the distributions from different contexts against\\neach other to identify noisy contexts executed with ZKTAs. Our evaluations on\\nreal IBMQ systems show that QONTEXTS increases program resilience by three\\norders of magnitude and fidelity by 1.33$\\\\times$ on average. Moreover, QONTEXTS\\nimproves throughput by 2$\\\\times$, advancing security in multi-programmed\\nenvironments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.ET\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T17:05:16Z\"}"}
