In this paper, we focus on\\nthe waveform design of ISAC system, which can realize radar sensing while also\\nfacilitate information transmission. The main content is as follows: first, we\\nformulate the waveform design problem as a nonconvex and non-smooth model with\\na unimodulus constraint based on the measurement metric of the radar and\\ncommunication system. Second, we transform the model into an unconstrained\\nproblem on the Riemannian manifold and construct the corresponding operators by\\nanalyzing the unimodulus constraint. Third, to achieve the solution\\nefficiently, we propose a low-complexity non-smooth unimodulus manifold\\ngradient descent (N-UMGD) algorithm with theoretical convergence guarantee. The\\nsimulation results show that the proposed algorithm can concentrate the energy\\nof the sensing signal in the desired direction and realize information\\ntransmission with a low bit error rate.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:08:50Z\"}"}
