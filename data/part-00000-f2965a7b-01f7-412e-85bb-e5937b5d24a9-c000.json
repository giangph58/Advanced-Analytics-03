{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01443v1\", \"title\": \"Split Federated Learning for UAV-Enabled Integrated Sensing,\\n  Computation, and Communication\", \"summary\": \"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with integrated sensing, computation, and\\ncommunication (ISCC) capabilities have become key enablers of next-generation\\nwireless networks. Federated edge learning (FEL) leverages UAVs as mobile\\nlearning agents to collect data, perform local model updates, and contribute to\\nglobal model aggregation. However, existing UAV-assisted FEL systems face\\ncritical challenges, including excessive computational demands, privacy risks,\\nand inefficient communication, primarily due to the requirement for full-model\\ntraining on resource-constrained UAVs. To deal with aforementioned challenges,\\nwe propose Split Federated Learning for UAV-Enabled ISCC (SFLSCC), a novel\\nframework that integrates split federated learning (SFL) into UAV-assisted FEL.\\nSFLSCC optimally partitions model training between UAVs and edge servers,\\nsignificantly reducing UAVs' computational burden while preserving data\\nprivacy. We conduct a theoretical analysis of UAV deployment, split point\\nselection, data sensing volume, and client-side aggregation frequency, deriving\\nclosed-form upper bounds for the convergence gap. Based on these insights, we\\nconceive a joint optimization problem to minimize the energy consumption\\nrequired to achieve a target model accuracy. Given the non-convex nature of the\\nproblem, we develop a low-complexity algorithm to efficiently determine UAV\\ndeployment, split point selection, and communication frequency. Extensive\\nsimulations on a target motion recognition task validate the effectiveness of\\nSFLSCC, demonstrating superior convergence performance and energy efficiency\\ncompared to baseline methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC,cs.ET\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T07:53:24Z\"}"}
