This process\\nplays a crucial role in shaping SMBH-galaxy co-evolution across cosmic time,\\nbut direct evidence linking nuclear winds to large-scale cold gas outflows,\\nparticularly in high-redshift quasars, has remained elusive. Here we present\\nstatistical evidence of a connection between nuclear winds and large-scale cold\\ngas outflows in quasars at $z \\\\sim 5.5$. Using stacked [C II] 158 $\\\\mu$m\\nemission profiles from ALMA observations, which trace galactic-scale neutral\\ngas, we compare broad absorption line (BAL) quasars -- tracing parsec- to\\nsub-kiloparsec-scale nuclear winds -- with non-BAL quasars. The BAL stack\\nreveals a significant (S/N=4.45) broad component in the [C II] emission,\\nindicating high-velocity neutral gas outflows with a velocity offset of $\\\\Delta\\nv_{\\\\rm b} = -2.1 \\\\times 10^2 \\\\, \\\\rm km\\\\,s^{-1}$ and a full width at half\\nmaximum of $1.18 \\\\times 10^3 \\\\, \\\\rm km\\\\,s^{-1}$, while the non-BAL stack shows\\nno such feature. We estimate that a few percent up to one-quarter of the BAL\\nwind energy is transferred to neutral gas on kiloparsec scales. These findings\\nprovide direct observational evidence that nuclear winds couple with\\ngalactic-scale neutral gas flows, supporting multi-phase AGN feedback models.\\nThis mechanism may contribute to explaining the diversity of $M_{\\\\rm BH}/M_*$\\nratios observed in some luminous AGN recently observed by JWST, compared to the\\nMagorrian relation.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T06:22:57Z\"}"}
