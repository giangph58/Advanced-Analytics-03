A model-independent formalism is employed to\\ntransform scattering phase shifts directly into momentum correlation functions,\\nthereby circumventing the approximations inherent in traditional methods, such\\nas the Lednick\\\\'y-Lyuboshits model. The $J/\\\\psi$-$p$ correlation functions,\\nincluding spin-averaged and partial-wave results, are predicted using\\nnear-physical pion mass lattice results. The $\\\\eta_c$-$p$ correlation function\\nis calculated for the first time. The derived correlation functions provide\\ncritical references for future experiments, such as those at the LHC, where\\nhigh-precision measurements of charmonium-nucleon correlations could unveil\\nvaluable insights into non-perturbative QCD dynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T09:10:58Z\"}"}
