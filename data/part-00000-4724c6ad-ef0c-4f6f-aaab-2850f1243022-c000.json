{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24251v1\", \"title\": \"Combining Query Performance Predictors: A Reproducibility Study\", \"summary\": \"A large number of approaches to Query Performance Prediction (QPP) have been\\nproposed over the last two decades. As early as 2009, Hauff et al. [28]\\nexplored whether different QPP methods may be combined to improve prediction\\nquality. Since then, significant research has been done both on QPP approaches,\\nas well as their evaluation. This study revisits Hauff et al.s work to assess\\nthe reproducibility of their findings in the light of new prediction methods,\\nevaluation metrics, and datasets. We expand the scope of the earlier\\ninvestigation by: (i) considering post-retrieval methods, including supervised\\nneural techniques (only pre-retrieval techniques were studied in [28]); (ii)\\nusing sMARE for evaluation, in addition to the traditional correlation\\ncoefficients and RMSE; and (iii) experimenting with additional datasets\\n(Clueweb09B and TREC DL). Our results largely support previous claims, but we\\nalso present several interesting findings. We interpret these findings by\\ntaking a more nuanced look at the correlation between QPP methods, examining\\nwhether they capture diverse information or rely on overlapping factors.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:01:58Z\"}"}
