This study presents a physics-informed neural network (PINN)\\nframework designed to infer the presence, shape, and motion of static or moving\\nsolid boundaries within a flow field. By integrating a body fraction parameter\\ninto the governing equations, the model enforces no-slip/no-penetration\\nboundary conditions in solid regions while preserving conservation laws of\\nfluid dynamics. Using partial flow field data, the method simultaneously\\nreconstructs the unknown flow field and infers the body fraction distribution,\\nthereby revealing solid boundaries. The framework is validated across diverse\\nscenarios, including incompressible Navier-Stokes and compressible Euler flows,\\nsuch as steady flow past a fixed cylinder, an inline oscillating cylinder, and\\nsubsonic flow over an airfoil. The results demonstrate accurate detection of\\nhidden boundaries, reconstruction of missing flow data, and estimation of\\ntrajectories and velocities of a moving body. Further analysis examines the\\neffects of data sparsity, velocity-only measurements, and noise on inference\\naccuracy. The proposed method exhibits robustness and versatility, highlighting\\nits potential for applications when only limited experimental or numerical data\\nare available.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn,cs.LG,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:30:46Z\"}"}
