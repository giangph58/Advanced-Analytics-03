{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06592v1\", \"title\": \"On Coalgebraic Product Constructions for Markov Chains and Automata\", \"summary\": \"Verifying traces of systems is a central topic in formal verification. We\\nstudy model checking of Markov chains (MCs) against temporal properties\\nrepresented as (finite) automata. For instance, given an MC and a deterministic\\nfinite automaton (DFA), a simple but practically useful model checking problem\\nasks for the probability of traces on the MC that are accepted by the DFA. A\\nstandard approach to solving this problem constructs a product MC of the given\\nMC and DFA, reducing the task to a simple reachability probability problem on\\nthe resulting product MC.\\n  In this paper, on top of our recent development of coalgebraic framework, we\\nfirst present a no-go theorem for product constructions, showing a case when we\\ncannot do product constructions for model checking. Specifically, we show that\\nthere are no coalgebraic product MCs of MCs and nondeterministic finite\\nautomata for computing the probability of the accepting traces. This no-go\\ntheorem is established via a characterisation of natural transformations\\nbetween certain functors that determine the type of branching, including\\nnondeterministic or probabilistic branching.\\n  Second, we present a coalgebraic product construction of MCs and multiset\\nfinite automata (MFAs) as a new instance within our framework. This\\nconstruction addresses a model checking problem that asks for the expected\\nnumber of accepting runs on MFAs over traces of MCs. The problem is reduced to\\nsolving linear equations, which is solvable in polynomial-time under a\\nreasonable assumption that ensures the finiteness of the solution.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LO\", \"categories\": \"cs.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T05:41:29Z\"}"}
