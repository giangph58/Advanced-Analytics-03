{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01500v1\", \"title\": \"The Polynomial Set Associated with a Fixed Number of Matrix-Matrix\\n  Multiplications\", \"summary\": \"We consider the problem of computing matrix polynomials $p(X)$, where $X$ is\\na large matrix, with as few matrix-matrix multiplications as possible. More\\nprecisely, let $ \\\\Pi_{2^{m}}^* $ represent the set of polynomials computable\\nwith $m$ matrix-matrix multiplications, but with an arbitrary number of matrix\\nadditions and scaling operations. We characterize this set through a tabular\\nparameterization. By deriving equivalence transformations of the tabular\\nrepresentation, we establish new methods that can be used to construct elements\\nof $ \\\\Pi_{2^{m}}^* $ and determine general properties of the set. The\\ntransformations allow us to eliminate variables and prove that the dimension is\\nbounded by $m^2$. Numerical simulations suggest that this is a sharp bound.\\nConsequently, we have identified a parameterization, which, to our knowledge,\\nis the first minimal parameterization. Furthermore, we conduct a study using\\ncomputational tools from algebraic geometry to determine the largest degree $d$\\nsuch that all polynomials of that degree belong to $ \\\\Pi_{2^{m}}^* $, or its\\nclosure. In many cases, the computational setup is constructive in the sense\\nthat it can also be used to determine a specific evaluation scheme for a given\\npolynomial.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:51:58Z\"}"}
