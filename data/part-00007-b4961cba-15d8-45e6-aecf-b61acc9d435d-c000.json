{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05838v1\", \"title\": \"Mind the Trojan Horse: Image Prompt Adapter Enabling Scalable and\\n  Deceptive Jailbreaking\", \"summary\": \"Recently, the Image Prompt Adapter (IP-Adapter) has been increasingly\\nintegrated into text-to-image diffusion models (T2I-DMs) to improve\\ncontrollability. However, in this paper, we reveal that T2I-DMs equipped with\\nthe IP-Adapter (T2I-IP-DMs) enable a new jailbreak attack named the hijacking\\nattack. We demonstrate that, by uploading imperceptible image-space adversarial\\nexamples (AEs), the adversary can hijack massive benign users to jailbreak an\\nImage Generation Service (IGS) driven by T2I-IP-DMs and mislead the public to\\ndiscredit the service provider. Worse still, the IP-Adapter's dependency on\\nopen-source image encoders reduces the knowledge required to craft AEs.\\nExtensive experiments verify the technical feasibility of the hijacking attack.\\nIn light of the revealed threat, we investigate several existing defenses and\\nexplore combining the IP-Adapter with adversarially trained models to overcome\\nexisting defenses' limitations.
