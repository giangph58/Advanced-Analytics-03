{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07437v1\", \"title\": \"Unifying and extending Diffusion Models through PDEs for solving Inverse\\n  Problems\", \"summary\": \"Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative tools with applications\\nin computer vision and scientific machine learning (SciML), where they have\\nbeen used to solve large-scale probabilistic inverse problems. Traditionally,\\nthese models have been derived using principles of variational inference,\\ndenoising, statistical signal processing, and stochastic differential\\nequations. In contrast to the conventional presentation, in this study we\\nderive diffusion models using ideas from linear partial differential equations\\nand demonstrate that this approach has several benefits that include a\\nconstructive derivation of the forward and reverse processes, a unified\\nderivation of multiple formulations and sampling strategies, and the discovery\\nof a new class of models. We also apply the conditional version of these models\\nto solving canonical conditional density estimation problems and challenging\\ninverse problems. These problems help establish benchmarks for systematically\\nquantifying the performance of different formulations and sampling strategies\\nin this study, and for future studies. Finally, we identify and implement a\\nmechanism through which a single diffusion model can be applied to measurements\\nobtained from multiple measurement operators. Taken together, the contents of\\nthis manuscript provide a new understanding and several new directions in the\\napplication of diffusion models to solving physics-based inverse problems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,stat.CO,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T04:07:36Z\"}"}
