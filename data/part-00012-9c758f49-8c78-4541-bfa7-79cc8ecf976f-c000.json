We\\nderive a proof of security, in the finite key setting, that is able to bound\\nthe secure key rate for any general, coherent, attack. We evaluate the\\nperformance of the system, showing our result can improve the noise tolerance\\nof the protocol in some, but not all, scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:07:36Z\"}"}
