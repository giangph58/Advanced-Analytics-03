In this work, we investigate SIDM dynamics\\nin a two-component dark matter model with mass ratios of order unity, motivated\\nby an asymmetric dark matter framework that naturally evades constraints from\\nrelic abundance and mediator decay, while enabling strong, velocity-dependent\\nself-interactions. We show that cross-component scatterings significantly\\nenhance mass segregation, driving the formation of dense, core collapsed-like\\nhalos. This effect couples naturally to SIDM-induced diversity, introducing a\\nnew mechanism for generating structural variations beyond those arising from\\ngravothermal evolution alone. Our results reveal a novel mechanism for\\nreconciling SIDM with small-scale observational tensions by enabling shifts in\\ncentral densities while preserving the flexibility to generate diverse halo\\nstructures. We further highlight that halo structural diversity may serve as a\\ndiagnostic of dark sector composition, opening a new observational window into\\nthe particle nature of SIDM.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T06:20:10Z\"}"}
