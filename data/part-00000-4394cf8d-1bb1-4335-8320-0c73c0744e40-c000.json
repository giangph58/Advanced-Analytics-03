{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24134v1\", \"title\": \"Moving mesh FSI approach for VIV simulation based on DG method with AMR\\n  technique\", \"summary\": \"Vortex-induced vibration (VIV) remains a fundamental yet computationally\\n  challenging problem in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). This study\\ndevelops a moving mesh Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) algorithm within a\\nRunge-Kutta\\n  Discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework. The\\nviscous term in the compressible Navier-Stokes (NS) equations is discretized\\nusing\\n  the high-order Interior Penalty Discontinuous Galerkin (IPDG)\\n  method. In addition to the above, key numerical advancements encompass\\n  the rigorous derivation of the Lax-Friedrichs (L-F) numerical flux\\nformulation\\n  tailored for moving meshes, an enhanced AMR-driven nodal correction\\n  methodology designed for curved surface geometries,\\n  and the implementation of a ghost-node boundary condition treatment scheme\\n  to address dynamic mesh motion. Numerical validation proceeds through three\\nphases:\\n  First, Couette flow simulations confirm the IPDG method's spatial\\n  convergence order. Subsequent analysis of unsteady flow past a cylinder\\n  demonstrate the AMR framework's efficacy in resolving vortex-dominated flow.\\n  Finally, six VIV benchmark cases are simulated using third-order IPDG\\ndiscretization,\\n  establishing the proposed FSI algorithm's accuracy. Furthermore, synthetic\\njets (SJs) flow control is investigated through\\n  four frequency-variant SJs configurations. The results reveal that SJs can\\nachieve completely\\n  VIV suppression at a low actuation frequency, while higher actuation\\n  frequencies reduce suppression efficiency due\\n  to the energy of the SJs is more in the form of acoustic wave.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:17:53Z\"}"}
