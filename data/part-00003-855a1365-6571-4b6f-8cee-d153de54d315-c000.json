{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04750v1\", \"title\": \"Competing effect of disorder on phase separation in active systems: from\\n  facilitated to hindered growth and rough interfaces\", \"summary\": \"We investigate the impact of random pinned disorder on a collection of self\\npropelled particles. To achieve this, we construct a continuum model by\\nformulating the coupled hydrodynamic equations for slow variables i.e, local\\ndensity and momentum density of particles. The disorder in the system acts as\\npinning sites, effectively immobilizing the particles that come into contact\\nwith them. Our numerical results reveal that weak disorder leads to phase\\nseparation in the system at density and activity lower than the typical values\\nfor motility induced phase separation. We construct a phase diagram using\\nnumerical simulations as well as linearized approximation in the plane of\\nactivity and packing fraction of particles at weak disorder densities. As\\ndisorder densities rise in the system, kinetic processes slow down, while at\\nhigh disorder densities, the system becomes heterogeneous and eventually\\nundergoes kinetic arrest. The structure factor tail deviates from Porods law,\\nindicating increased roughness at domain interfaces under strong disorder.\\nFurthermore, we analyze the fractal dimension of the interface as a function of\\ndisorder density, highlighting the increasing irregularity of phase separated\\ndomains.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T05:51:02Z\"}"}
