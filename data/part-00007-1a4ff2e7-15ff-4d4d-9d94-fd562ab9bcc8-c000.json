{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01876v1\", \"title\": \"The TELOS Collaboration Approach to Reproducibility and Open Science\", \"summary\": \"The TELOS Collaboration is committed to producing and analysing lattice data\\nreproducibly, and sharing its research openly. In this document, we set out the\\nways that we make this happen, where there is scope for improvement, and how we\\nplan to achieve this. This is intended to work both as a statement of policy,\\nand a guide to practice for those beginning to work with us. Some details and\\nrecommendations are specific to the context in which the Collaboration works\\n(such as references to requirements imposed by funders in the United Kingdom);\\nhowever, most recommendations may serve as a template for other collaborations\\nlooking to make their own work reproducible. Full tutorials on every aspect of\\nreproducibility are beyond the scope of this document, but we refer to other\\nresources for further information.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-lat\", \"categories\": \"hep-lat\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T16:32:29Z\"}"}
