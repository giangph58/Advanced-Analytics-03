Initially, we examine the double\\nBeltrami states as a special class of steady solutions to the ideal Hall MHD\\nequations, which are closely related to Beltrami flows in incompressible fluid\\ndynamics. Specifically, we classify the double Beltrami states and show that\\nthey can be derived by using the variational method as energy minimizers,\\nsubject to the conservation of two helicities. We then extend our analysis to\\ntime-dependent double Beltrami states in the viscous and resistive Hall MHD\\nequations, exploring their exact form and stability properties.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T10:24:39Z\"}"}
