This paper provides a more rigorous approach to the choice of\\nweights by defining a set of desirable properties that weighting models should\\nmeet. It shows that Bayesian Networks is the only model across statistical,\\neconometric, and machine learning computational models that meets these\\nproperties. An example with EU-SILC data illustrates this new approach\\nhighlighting its potential for policies.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.EM\", \"categories\": \"econ.EM,stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:18:00Z\"}"}
