However, its impact on non-equilibrium carrier\\nlifetimes remains debated. Here, we systematically tune the doping level of\\nquasi-freestanding epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) via potassium deposition and\\nprobe its ultrafast carrier dynamics directly in the band structure using time-\\nand angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES). We find that increased\\ndoping lowers both the peak electronic temperature and the cooling rate of\\nDirac carriers, which we attribute to higher electronic heat capacity and\\nreduced phonon emission phase space. Comparing quasi-freestanding graphene with\\ngraphene on a carbon buffer layer reveals faster relaxation in the latter,\\nlikely due to additional phonon modes being available for heat dissipation.\\nThese findings offer new insights for optimizing graphene in electronic and\\nphotonic technologies.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T07:23:10Z\"}"}
