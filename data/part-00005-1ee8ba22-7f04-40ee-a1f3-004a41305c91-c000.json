{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07464v1\", \"title\": \"Stable and Efficient Charging of Superconducting C-shunt Flux Quantum\\n  Batteries\", \"summary\": \"Quantum batteries, as miniature energy storage devices, have sparked\\nsignificant research interest in recent years. However, achieving rapid and\\nstable energy transfer in quantum batteries while obeying quantum speed limits\\nremains a critical challenge. In this work, we experimentally optimize the\\ncharging process by leveraging the unique energy level structure of a\\nsuperconducting capacitively-shunted flux qubit, using counterdiabatic pulses\\nin the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage. Compared to previous studies, we\\nimpose two different norm constraints on the driving Hamiltonian, achieving\\noptimal charging without exceeding the overall driving strength. Furthermore,\\nwe experimentally demonstrate a charging process that achieves the quantum\\nspeed limit. In addition, we introduce a dimensionless parameter $\\\\mathcal{S}$\\nto unify charging speed and stability, offering a universal metric for\\nperformance optimization. In contrast to metrics such as charging power and\\nthermodynamic efficiency, the $\\\\mathcal{S}$ criterion quantitatively captures\\nthe stability of ergentropy while also considering the charging speed. Our\\nresults highlight the potential of the capacitively-shunted qubit platform as\\nan ideal candidate for realizing three-level quantum batteries and deliver\\nnovel strategies for optimizing energy transfer protocols.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T05:26:49Z\"}"}
