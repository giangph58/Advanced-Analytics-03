Unlike previous\\nstudies by Dolbeault et al. [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 186, (2007), 133-158]\\nand Addala and Tayeb [J. Hyperbolic Differ. Equ., 16, (2019), 131-156], which\\nrequired bounded initial data, our work considers initial data that need not be\\nbounded. We develop new techniques for handling weak entropy solutions that\\nsatisfy the natural bounds associated with the kinetic entropy inequality. Our\\nproof employs the relative entropy method and various compactness arguments to\\nestablish the convergence and properties of these solutions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T04:35:28Z\"}"}
