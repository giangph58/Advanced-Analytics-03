{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23807v1\", \"title\": \"Measurement-induced phase transitions for free fermions in a\\n  quasiperiodic potential\", \"summary\": \"We study the dynamics under continuous measurements for free fermions in a\\nquasiperiodic potential by using the Aubry-Andr\\\\'{e}-Harper model with hopping\\nrate $J$ and potential strength $V$. On the basis of the quantum trajectory\\nmethod, we obtain the phase diagram for the steady-state entanglement entropy\\nand demonstrate that robust logarithmic system-size scaling emerges up to a\\ncritical potential strength $V_c/J \\\\sim 2.3$. Moreover, we find that the\\nmeasurement induces entanglement phase transitions from the logarithmic-law\\nphase to the area-law phase for the potential strength $V< V_c$, while any\\nfinite measurement stabilizes the area-law phase for $V>V_c$. This result is\\ndistinct from the entanglement scaling in the unitary limit, where volume-law\\nand area-law phases undergo a transition at $V/J=2$. To further support the\\nphase diagram, we analyze the connected correlation function and find that it\\nshows algebraic decay in the logarithmic-law phase, while it decays quickly in\\nthe area-law phase. Our results can be tested in ultracold atoms by introducing\\nquasiperiodic potentials and continuously monitoring the local occupation\\nnumber with an off-resonant probe light.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas,cond-mat.stat-mech,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T07:42:24Z\"}"}
