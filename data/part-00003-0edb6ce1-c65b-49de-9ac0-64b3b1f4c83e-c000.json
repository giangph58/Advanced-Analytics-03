Here, we propose a topologically\\nprotected MTOC scheme mediated by a Rydberg superatom to address these\\nlimitations. By constructing cross-linked Fock-state lattices (FSLs) through a\\ndual-mode Jaynes-Cummings (JC) architecture, we map the effective hybrid system\\nonto an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger~(SSH) model with tunable hopping rates.\\nPhoton-number--dependent property of hopping rates triggers a topological phase\\ntransition in the extended SSH chain, converting the defect mode into a\\ntopological channel that directionally pumps photons between microwave and\\noptical cavities. This mechanism leverages Rydberg blockade-enhanced\\nphoton-superatom couplings to establish a robust energy transfer channel,\\nachieving high-efficiency photon conversion under realistic decoherence. Our\\ntheoretical framework demonstrates how topological protection synergizes with\\nRydberg-mediated light-matter interactions to realize a robust quantum\\ntransducer, providing a scalable platform for noise-resilient quantum networks\\nand frequency-multiplexed quantum interfaces.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:20:38Z\"}"}
