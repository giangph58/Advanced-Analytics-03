{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07918v1\", \"title\": \"Shuffling via Transpositions\", \"summary\": \"We consider a family of card shuffles of $n$ cards, where the allowed moves\\ninvolve transpositions corresponding to the Jucys--Murphy elements of\\n$\\\\{S_m\\\\}_{m \\\\leq n}$. We diagonalize the transition matrix of these shuffles.\\nAs a special case, we consider the $k$-star transpositions shuffle, a natural\\ninterpolation between random transpositions and star transpositions. We proved\\nthat the $k$-star transpositions shuffle exhibits total variation cutoff at\\ntime $\\\\frac{2n-(k+1)}{2(n-1)}n\\\\log n$ with a window of\\n$\\\\frac{2n-(k+1)}{2(n-1)}n$. Furthermore, we prove that for the case where $k/n\\n\\\\rightarrow 0$ or $1$, this shuffle has the same limit profile as random\\ntranspositions, which has been fully determined by Teyssier.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:33:30Z\"}"}
