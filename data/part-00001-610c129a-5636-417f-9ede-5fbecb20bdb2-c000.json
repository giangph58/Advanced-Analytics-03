The\\nconfinement condition under consideration is of Signorini type, and is given\\nover the boundary of the linearly viscoelastic body under consideration. In\\norder to derive a suitable notion of solution that possesses a sufficient\\ndegree of regularity, we introduce the concept of ``admissible'' applied body\\nforce. In agreement with expectations, the variational problem that solutions\\nmust satisfy is a system of hyperbolic variational inequalities, and the\\ndisplacement acceleration is a vector-valued measure in the sense of\\nDinculeanu.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:19:35Z\"}"}
