We demonstrate that the approaches to tOAM presented in several recent\\npapers are incorrect and lead to unphysical results, including erroneous claims\\nof zero total tOAM. We emphasize the importance of calculating the OAM of any\\nextended physical object at a common instant of time, and reemphasize the\\nspecial status of the centre of energy as a reference point for all OAM\\ncalculations. The theory presented in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 193901 (2021)] is\\nthe only correct classical field-based framework that both agrees with\\nexperiments and provides a self consistent understanding of transverse OAM in\\nspatiotemporal light fields.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:53:59Z\"}"}
