{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05727v1\", \"title\": \"SAP-CoPE: Social-Aware Planning using Cooperative Pose Estimation with\\n  Infrastructure Sensor Nodes\", \"summary\": \"Autonomous driving systems must operate safely in human-populated indoor\\nenvironments, where challenges such as limited perception and occlusion\\nsensitivity arise when relying solely on onboard sensors. These factors\\ngenerate difficulties in the accurate recognition of human intentions and the\\ngeneration of comfortable, socially aware trajectories. To address these\\nissues, we propose SAP-CoPE, a social-aware planning framework that integrates\\ncooperative infrastructure with a novel 3D human pose estimation method and a\\nmodel predictive control-based controller. This real-time framework formulates\\nan optimization problem that accounts for uncertainty propagation in the camera\\nprojection matrix while ensuring human joint coherence. The proposed method is\\nadaptable to single- or multi-camera configurations and can incorporate sparse\\nLiDAR point-cloud data. To enhance safety and comfort in human environments, we\\nintegrate a human personal space field based on human pose into a model\\npredictive controller, enabling the system to navigate while avoiding\\ndiscomfort zones. Extensive evaluations in both simulated and real-world\\nsettings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating socially\\naware trajectories for autonomous systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T06:55:39Z\"}"}
