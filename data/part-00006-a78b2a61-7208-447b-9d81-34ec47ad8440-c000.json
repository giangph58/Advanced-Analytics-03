Drawing upon the freeness-of-trade matrix, which allows\\nthe modeling of N-state trade costs, we develop a ``geometry of inconvenience''\\nto better understand how they impact equilbrium outcomes. The freeness-of-trade\\nmatrix was introduced in a model by Mossay and Tabuchi, where they essentially\\nproved that if a freeness-of-trade matrix is positive definite, then the\\ncorresponding model admits a unique equilibrium. Drawing upon the spectral\\ntheory of metrics, we prove the model admits nonunique, perverse, equilibria.\\nWe use this result to provide a family of policy relevant bipartite examples,\\nwith substantive applications to economic sanctions. More generally, we show\\nhow the network structure of the freeness of trade is central to understanding\\nthe impacts of policy interventions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.MG\", \"categories\": \"math.MG,econ.TH,math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T12:35:17Z\"}"}
