Unlike standard functional equations, where the\\nequality must hold for all $x$ in a fixed set, our problem involves a domain\\nthat depends on $F$ itself, introducing complexity but allowing for more\\npossibilities of solutions.\\n  We find the explicit expressions of all solutions when $\\\\delta < 0$ and, when\\n$\\\\delta > 0$, for distributions with bounded support. In the unbounded support\\ncase, we focus attention on continuous and lattice distributions. In the\\ncontinuous setting, with support $\\\\mathbb{R}_+$, we reduce the problem to a\\ndelay differential equation, showing that, besides particular cases of the\\nexponential distribution, mixtures of exponential and gamma distributions and\\nmany others are solutions as well. The lattice case, with support\\n$\\\\mathbb{Z}_+$ is treated analogously and reduced to the study of a difference\\nequation. Analogous results are obtained; in particular, mixtures of geometric\\nand negative binomial distributions are found to solve the problem.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T17:37:30Z\"}"}
