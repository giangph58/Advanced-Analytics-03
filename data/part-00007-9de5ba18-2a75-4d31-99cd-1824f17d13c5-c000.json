The existing approach to this problem relies on\\nheuristics; in this paper, we solve this problem by formulating it as an\\noptimization problem that arises from generalizing $\\\\mathsf{ApproxMC}$'s\\ncorrectness proof to arbitrary parameter values.\\n  Our approach separates the concerns of algorithm soundness and optimality,\\nallowing us to address the former without the need for repetitive case-by-case\\nargumentation, while establishing a clear framework for the latter.\\nFurthermore, after reduction, the resulting optimization problem takes on an\\nexceptionally simple form, enabling the use of a basic search algorithm and\\nproviding insight into how parameter values affect algorithm performance.\\nExperimental results demonstrate that our optimized parameters improve the\\nruntime performance of the latest $\\\\mathsf{ApproxMC}$ by a factor of 1.6 to\\n2.4, depending on the error tolerance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:58:41Z\"}"}
