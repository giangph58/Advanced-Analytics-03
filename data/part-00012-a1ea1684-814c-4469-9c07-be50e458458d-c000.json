{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04739v1\", \"title\": \"MedGNN: Capturing the Links Between Urban Characteristics and Medical\\n  Prescriptions\", \"summary\": \"Understanding how urban socio-demographic and environmental factors relate\\nwith health is essential for public health and urban planning. However,\\ntraditional statistical methods struggle with nonlinear effects, while machine\\nlearning models often fail to capture geographical (nearby areas being more\\nsimilar) and topological (unequal connectivity between places) effects in an\\ninterpretable way. To address this, we propose MedGNN, a spatio-topologically\\nexplicit framework that constructs a 2-hop spatial graph, integrating\\npositional and locational node embeddings with urban characteristics in a graph\\nneural network. Applied to MEDSAT, a comprehensive dataset covering over 150\\nenvironmental and socio-demographic factors and six prescription outcomes\\n(depression, anxiety, diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and opioids) across 4,835\\nGreater London neighborhoods, MedGNN improved predictions by over 25% on\\naverage compared to baseline methods. Using depression prescriptions as a case\\nstudy, we analyzed graph embeddings via geographical principal component\\nanalysis, identifying findings that: align with prior research (e.g., higher\\nantidepressant prescriptions among older and White populations), contribute to\\nongoing debates (e.g., greenery linked to higher and NO2 to lower\\nprescriptions), and warrant further study (e.g., canopy evaporation correlated\\nwith fewer prescriptions). These results demonstrate MedGNN's potential, and\\nmore broadly, of carefully applied machine learning, to advance\\ntransdisciplinary public health research.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T05:35:16Z\"}"}
