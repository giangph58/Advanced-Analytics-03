{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02472v1\", \"title\": \"Polarimetry imprints of exotic compact objects: solitonic boson stars\", \"summary\": \"In this work we analyze the polarization observational properties of\\nsolitonic boson stars orbited by spherical hot-spots emitting synchrotron\\nradiation from a thermal distribution of electrons. We consider three boson\\nstar configurations with different compacticities ranging from a dilute model\\nwith a large radius to an ultra-compact model capable of holding null bound\\norbits. We observe that the polarimetric imprints of the primary images for all\\nmodels are comparable to those of the Schwarzschild spacetime, and thus any\\npotentially distinguishable differences must arise from the additional\\nstructure of secondary and plunge-through images. For low inclination\\n($20^\\\\circ$) observations we find that the two QU-loops of the least compact\\nmodel are in contradiction with the current ALMA and GRAVITY observations and\\neffectively excludes the possibility of Sgr A* being a dilute solitonic boson\\nstar. For high inclination ($80^\\\\circ$) observations, both the Electric Vector\\nPosition Angle (EVPA) and the QU-loops present large qualitative deviations\\nfrom the Schwarzschild black-hole for all models analyzed. Our results\\nemphasize the suitability of polarimetry as a framework to test the nature of\\nsupermassive compact objects with future observations, especially at high\\ninclination.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T10:47:28Z\"}"}
