However, existing research on the detection of\\nmicro-expressions has focused on adults, whose expressions differ in their\\ncharacteristics from those of children. The lack of research is a direct\\nconsequence of the lack of a child-based micro-expressions dataset as it is\\nmuch more challenging to capture children's facial expressions due to the lack\\nof predictability and controllability. This study compiles a dataset of\\nspontaneous child micro-expression videos, the first of its kind, to the best\\nof the authors knowledge. The dataset is captured in the wild using video\\nconferencing software. This dataset enables us to then explore key features and\\ndifferences between adult and child micro-expressions. This study also\\nestablishes a baseline for the automated spotting and recognition of\\nmicro-expressions in children using three approaches comprising of hand-created\\nand learning-based approaches.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T16:55:32Z\"}"}
