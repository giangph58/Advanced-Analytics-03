In our previous work, we developed a\\nsystematic framework to understand ESB within 2D invertible topological order.\\nMeanwhile, the origin of parity violation in the Standard Model remains one of\\nthe most profound mysteries in physics, with no clear explanation to date. In\\nthis study, we explore the ESB of parity symmetry by three-dimensional\\nfermionic topological order (fTO), offering potential insights into the origins\\nof parity violation. As the simplest example, here we consider an fTO related\\nto the intrinsic interacting fermionic SPT phase protected by $Z_2^f\\\\times\\nZ_2\\\\times Z_8$ symmetry in three dimensions. We show that time-reversal\\nsymmetry (TRS) with ${T}^2=1$ on physical fermions is incompatible with such\\nfTO; then, through the so-called crystalline equivalence principle, we show\\nthat the parity symmetry is also incompatible with it. In comparison,\\nconventional TRS with ${T}^2={P}_f$ remains compatible to this fTO. We also\\ndiscuss a general framework to study the ESB phenomenon for 3D fTO.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.supr-con,hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T16:23:36Z\"}"}
