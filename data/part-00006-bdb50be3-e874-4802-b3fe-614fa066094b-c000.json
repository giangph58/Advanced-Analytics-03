{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07945v1\", \"title\": \"GenEAva: Generating Cartoon Avatars with Fine-Grained Facial Expressions\\n  from Realistic Diffusion-based Faces\", \"summary\": \"Cartoon avatars have been widely used in various applications, including\\nsocial media, online tutoring, and gaming. However, existing cartoon avatar\\ndatasets and generation methods struggle to present highly expressive avatars\\nwith fine-grained facial expressions and are often inspired from real-world\\nidentities, raising privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we propose a\\nnovel framework, GenEAva, for generating high-quality cartoon avatars with\\nfine-grained facial expressions. Our approach fine-tunes a state-of-the-art\\ntext-to-image diffusion model to synthesize highly detailed and expressive\\nfacial expressions. We then incorporate a stylization model that transforms\\nthese realistic faces into cartoon avatars while preserving both identity and\\nexpression. Leveraging this framework, we introduce the first expressive\\ncartoon avatar dataset, GenEAva 1.0, specifically designed to capture 135\\nfine-grained facial expressions, featuring 13,230 expressive cartoon avatars\\nwith a balanced distribution across genders, racial groups, and age ranges. We\\ndemonstrate that our fine-tuned model generates more expressive faces than the\\nstate-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model SDXL. We also verify that the\\ncartoon avatars generated by our framework do not include memorized identities\\nfrom fine-tuning data. The proposed framework and dataset provide a diverse and\\nexpressive benchmark for future research in cartoon avatar generation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:54:02Z\"}"}
