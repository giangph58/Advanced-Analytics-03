However, existing methods face challenges in providing\\nsufficient scene representation, capturing structural information, and\\nmaintaining global consistency in scenes emerging significant movement or being\\nforgotten. To this end, we present HS-SLAM to tackle these problems. To enhance\\nscene representation capacity, we propose a hybrid encoding network that\\ncombines the complementary strengths of hash-grid, tri-planes, and one-blob,\\nimproving the completeness and smoothness of reconstruction. Additionally, we\\nintroduce structural supervision by sampling patches of non-local pixels rather\\nthan individual rays to better capture the scene structure. To ensure global\\nconsistency, we implement an active global bundle adjustment (BA) to eliminate\\ncamera drifts and mitigate accumulative errors. Experimental results\\ndemonstrate that HS-SLAM outperforms the baselines in tracking and\\nreconstruction accuracy while maintaining the efficiency required for robotics.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:59:54Z\"}"}
