{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02515v1\", \"title\": \"Exploration-Driven Generative Interactive Environments\", \"summary\": \"Modern world models require costly and time-consuming collection of large\\nvideo datasets with action demonstrations by people or by environment-specific\\nagents. To simplify training, we focus on using many virtual environments for\\ninexpensive, automatically collected interaction data. Genie, a recent\\nmulti-environment world model, demonstrates simulation abilities of many\\nenvironments with shared behavior. Unfortunately, training their model requires\\nexpensive demonstrations. Therefore, we propose a training framework merely\\nusing a random agent in virtual environments. While the model trained in this\\nmanner exhibits good controls, it is limited by the random exploration\\npossibilities. To address this limitation, we propose AutoExplore Agent - an\\nexploration agent that entirely relies on the uncertainty of the world model,\\ndelivering diverse data from which it can learn the best. Our agent is fully\\nindependent of environment-specific rewards and thus adapts easily to new\\nenvironments. With this approach, the pretrained multi-environment model can\\nquickly adapt to new environments achieving video fidelity and controllability\\nimprovement. In order to obtain automatically large-scale interaction datasets\\nfor pretraining, we group environments with similar behavior and controls. To\\nthis end, we annotate the behavior and controls of 974 virtual environments - a\\ndataset that we name RetroAct. For building our model, we first create an open\\nimplementation of Genie - GenieRedux and apply enhancements and adaptations in\\nour version GenieRedux-G. Our code and data are available at\\nhttps://github.com/insait-institute/GenieRedux.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T12:01:41Z\"}"}
