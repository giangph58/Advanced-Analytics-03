While the model space was restricted only to seniority zero\\nconfigurations in the previous applications of the NEGF method, we remove this\\nrestriction and include seniority non-zero configurations as well. In such\\nmodel space, a proton-neutron interaction is active, for which we introduce a\\nrandom interaction. We find that the seniority non-zero configurations\\nsignificantly increase the fission cross sections, and thus the\\nfission-to-capture branching ratios, even though they are still underestimated\\nby about one order of magnitude as compared to the experimental data. In\\naddition, we also find that the fission dynamics is governed by only a small\\nnumber of eigenstates of the model Hamiltonian.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T10:18:05Z\"}"}
