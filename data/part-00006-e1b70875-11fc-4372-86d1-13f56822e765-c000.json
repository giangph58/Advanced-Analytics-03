{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07900v1\", \"title\": \"Temporal Tensors and Quantum Shortcut Dynamics in a Supermaze of\\n  Multidimensional Time\", \"summary\": \"We develop a theoretical framework that unifies concepts of multiple time\\ndimensions, quantum shortcut dynamics, and complex topological structures\\n('supermazes') to explore novel phenomena in quantum and classical systems. In\\nparticular, we introduce a Temporal Tensor Formalism to describe\\nmultidimensional time, define Quantum Shortcut Operators that enact\\nnear-instantaneous state transitions, and incorporate these into a supermaze\\ntopological model inspired by labyrinthine geometry and network complexity. We\\nshow how this framework can give rise to surprising effects such as anomalous\\nthermodynamic relaxation (analogous to the Mpemba effect) in quantum systems.\\nTheoretical implications for quantum computing (including quantum cloud\\nnetworks) are discussed, and connections are drawn to established mathematical\\nparadoxes and physical principles.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.ET\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T16:19:56Z\"}"}
