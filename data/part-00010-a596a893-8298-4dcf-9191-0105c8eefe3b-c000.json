{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07614v1\", \"title\": \"Enhanced THz emission from spintronic emitters with Pt-Al alloys\", \"summary\": \"Platinum (Pt) is the element with the largest spin Hall conductivity and is\\nknown as the most efficient spin-to-charge conversion material in spintronic\\nTHz emitters. By alloying with aluminum (Al), its resistivity can be\\nsubstantially increased, exceeding $100\\\\,\\\\mu\\\\Omega$cm. While the spin Hall\\nconductivity is reduced by alloying, the relative resistivity increase\\nsurpasses the reduction of spin Hall conductivity and thereby enhances the spin\\nHall angle. We make use of this mechanism to improve the commonly used Pt-based\\nspintronic THz emitter and demonstrate that an increase of 67% in the THz\\nemission amplitude can be achieved between 20\\\\% and 30\\\\% Al in Pt. We show that\\nthe enhanced THz emission amplitude is driven by the enhanced multilayer\\nimpedance due to the larger resistivity.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T10:05:03Z\"}"}
