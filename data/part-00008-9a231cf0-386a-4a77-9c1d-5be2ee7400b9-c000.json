{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24044v1\", \"title\": \"Bi-Level Route Optimization and Path Planning with Hazard Exploration\", \"summary\": \"Effective risk monitoring in dynamic environments such as disaster zones\\nrequires an adaptive exploration strategy to detect hidden threats. We propose\\na bi-level unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) monitoring strategy that efficiently\\nintegrates high-level route optimization with low-level path planning for known\\nand unknown hazards. At the high level, we formulate the route optimization as\\na vehicle routing problem (VRP) to determine the optimal sequence for visiting\\nknown hazard locations. To strategically incorporate exploration efficiency, we\\nintroduce an edge-based centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT), which refines\\nbaseline routes using pseudo-nodes and allocates path budgets based on the\\nUAV's battery capacity using a line segment Voronoi diagram. At the low level,\\npath planning maximizes information gain within the allocated path budget by\\ngenerating kinematically feasible B-spline trajectories. Bayesian inference is\\napplied to dynamically update hazard probabilities, enabling the UAVs to\\nprioritize unexplored regions. Simulation results demonstrate that edge-based\\nCVT improves spatial coverage and route uniformity compared to the node-based\\nmethod. Additionally, our optimized path planning consistently outperforms\\nbaselines in hazard discovery rates across a diverse set of scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:08:51Z\"}"}
