Despite advances in\\nanomaly detection, existing systems often fall short in areas such as\\npost-detection validation, scalability, and effective maintenance. These\\nlimitations not only hinder the detection of new threats but also impair\\noverall system performance. To address these challenges, we propose CEDLog, a\\nnovel practical framework that integrates Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)\\nfor continual learning and implements distributed computing for scalable\\nprocessing by integrating Apache Airflow and Dask. In CEDLog, anomalies are\\ndetected through the synthesis of Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) and Graph\\nConvolutional Networks (GCNs) using critical features present in event logs.\\nThrough comparisons with update strategies on large-scale datasets, we\\ndemonstrate the strengths of CEDLog, showcasing efficient updates and low false\\npositives\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T06:50:30Z\"}"}
