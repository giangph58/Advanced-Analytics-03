In\\nthis theory, the Kubo conductivity is a functional of the electron dispersion\\nand local (momentum-independent) electron self-energy, which is itself a causal\\nfunctional of the dispersion and disorder strength. We obtain exact closed\\nexpressions for the asymptotic low-density conductivities at zero temperature\\nin the form of power laws of the density and disorder strength with universal\\nexponents. The crossover to the semiclassical regime of high density is studied\\nnumerically, as well as the temperature dependence. Our model and results may\\nbe relevant to interpret linear magneto-transport experiments performed in the\\nmetallic regime of gated two-dimensional semiconductors.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T16:25:38Z\"}"}
