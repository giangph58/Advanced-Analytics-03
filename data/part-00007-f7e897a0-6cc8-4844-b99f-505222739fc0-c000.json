{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02497v1\", \"title\": \"An all-electrical scheme for valley polarization in graphene\", \"summary\": \"We propose an all-electrical setup for achieving valley polarization in\\ngraphene. The setup consists of a finite graphene sheet connected to normal\\nmetal electrodes on both sides, with the junctions aligned along the zigzag\\nedges while the armchair edges remain free. Each normal metal has two\\nterminals, and when a bias is applied at one terminal while keeping the other\\nthree grounded, valley polarization arises due to transverse momentum matching\\nbetween graphene and the normal metal. The valley polarization is maximized\\nwhen the Fermi wave vector of the normal metal is approximately half the\\nseparation between the $K$ and $K'$ valleys in graphene. We analyze the\\ndependence of conductance and valley polarization on system parameters such as\\nthe width and length of the graphene sheet, as well as the chemical potentials\\nof graphene and the normal metal. The conductance through graphene increases\\nwith its width, while an increase in length initially reduces the conductance\\nbefore leading to oscillatory behavior due to Fabry-P\\\\'erot interference. The\\nvalley polarization efficiency decreases with increasing graphene length due to\\ninter-valley mixing from back-and-forth reflections within the graphene region.\\nFurthermore, we investigate the impact of disorder in graphene and find that\\nwhile conductance near the Dirac point increases with disorder strength due to\\nenhanced density of states, valley polarization efficiency decreases due to\\nintervalley scattering. Our results provide insights into controlling valley\\npolarization in graphene-based devices for valleytronic applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T11:20:41Z\"}"}
