The bulk electronic\\nstates in the range 0.793<=x<0.818 are situated on the insulator side of the\\nAnderson transition, as indicated by k_Fl values (where k_F is the Fermi\\nwavenumber and l is the mean free path) falling below the Ioffe-Regel criterion\\n(i.e., k_F l<1). In contrast, the topological surface states retain high\\nmobility and even exhibit quantum oscillations, demonstrating their resilient\\nnature against strong disorder. These findings highlight the delocalized nature\\nof the topological surface states despite Anderson localization of the bulk\\nelectronic states.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T04:15:36Z\"}"}
