{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05043v1\", \"title\": \"Displacement Memory Effect from Supersymmetry\", \"summary\": \"We explain the recent results regarding the displacement memory effect (DME)\\nof plane gravitational waves using supersymmetric quantum mechanics. This novel\\napproach stems from the fact that both geodesic and Schr\\\\\\\"odinger equations are\\nSturm-Liouville boundary value problems. Supersymmetry provides a unified\\nframework for P\\\\\\\"oschl-Teller and Scarf profiles and restores the critical\\nvalues of wave amplitudes for DME in a natural way. Within our framework, we\\nobtain a compact formula for DME in terms of the asymptotic values of the\\nsuperpotential and the geodesics. In addition, this new technique enables us to\\nbuild plane and gravitational waves with 2-transverse directions using\\nsuperpartner potentials. Lastly, we study DME within a singular wave profile\\ninspired by supersymmetric quantum mechanics, which shows the broader\\napplicability of our method.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:12:51Z\"}"}
