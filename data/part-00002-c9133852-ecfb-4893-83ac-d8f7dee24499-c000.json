Our study focuses on\\nfive fundamental polarization states predicted in GQFT: two tensor ($+,\\n\\\\times$), two vector (x, y), and one scalar (breathing) mode, focusing on their\\ndistinctive detection signatures in space-based interferometers like LISA and\\nTaiji. Using first-order orbital dynamics in the Solar System Barycenter frame,\\nwe identify three novel observational features: (1) characteristic interference\\npatterns between polarization modes, (2) distinctive null-point signatures\\nenabling mode discrimination, and (3) sky-position-dependent optimal detection\\nwindows. Our approach provides complete sky coverage through polarization\\nmapping while remaining fully compatible with existing mission designs, notably\\navoiding the need for challenging direct breathing-mode measurements. The\\nresults are presented through comprehensive sky maps, offering both theoretical\\ninsights into gravitational wave polarization and practical tools for future\\ndetector networks. This work establishes a new paradigm for testing fundamental\\ngravity theories through their unique polarization fingerprints, with\\nparticular relevance for upcoming multi-messenger gravitational wave astronomy.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:15:45Z\"}"}
