{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02297v1\", \"title\": \"The temperature dependence of fractional topological charge objects\", \"summary\": \"We present a novel method for defining the topological charge contained\\nwithin distinct topological objects in the nontrivial ground-state fields of\\nSU(N) lattice gauge theory. Such an analysis has been called for by the growing\\nnumber of models for Yang-Mills topological structure which propose the\\nexistence of fractionally charged objects. This investigation is performed for\\nSU(3) at a range of temperatures across the deconfinement phase transition,\\nproviding an assessment of how the topological structure evolves with\\ntemperature. This reveals a connection between the topological charge and\\nholonomy of the system which must be satisfied by finite-temperature models of\\nYang-Mills vacuum structure. We find a promising consistency with the\\ninstanton-dyon model for SU(N) vacuum structure.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-lat\", \"categories\": \"hep-lat,hep-ph,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T06:04:20Z\"}"}
