Previous works have predominantly assumed that\\nall participants own a car and have focused on one-to-one arrangements.\\nAdditionally, there is a scarcity of research on integrating High Occupancy\\nVehicle (HOV) lanes and mathematical modelling. This study addresses these gaps\\nby presenting a novel Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model that allows\\nfor role flexibility irrespective of car ownership and considers the\\nimplications of HOV lanes. Computational analysis highlights the benefits of\\nincorporating role flexibility and accommodating non-car-owning participants in\\nmany-to-many ridesharing systems. Yet, excessive role shifts may create\\nimbalances, impacting service to non-car owners. Further research should\\nexplore these correlations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:45:19Z\"}"}
