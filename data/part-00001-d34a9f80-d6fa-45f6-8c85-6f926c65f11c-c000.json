To date, PhPs with\\nhigh confinement and low loss have been mainly observed in the mid-infrared\\nregime and mostly in manually exfoliated flakes of van der Waals (vdW)\\nmaterials. In this work, we demonstrate the existence of low-loss,\\nthickness-tunable phonon polaritons in the far-infrared regime within\\ntransferable free-standing SrTiO3 membranes synthesized through a scalable\\napproach, achieving high figures of merit, which are comparable to the previous\\nrecord values from the vdW materials. Leveraging atomic precision in thickness\\ncontrol, large dimensions, and compatibility with mature oxide electronics,\\nfunctional oxide membranes present a promising large-scale two-dimensional (2D)\\nplatform alternative to vdW materials for on-chip polaritonic technologies in\\nthe far-infrared regime.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:48:34Z\"}"}
