This characteristic inversion\\nsymmetry breaking suggests the presence of nonlinear optical properties. Yet\\nonly recently have nonlinear optical phenomena such as second harmonic\\ngeneration (SHG) been reported in this material. In this study, we synthesized\\nLa4Ge3S12 using the direct reaction method and characterized the composition,\\ncrystal structure, and electronic structure using electron probe microanalysis,\\npowder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron\\nspectroscopy. The experimentally measured electronic structure is in line with\\nthat obtained using first-principles calculations. In addition, we observed the\\nnonlinear optical properties of La4Ge3S12 in response to an ultrashort infrared\\npulsed laser. We found that the intensity of the SHG depends quadratically on\\nthe intensity of the incident light, mirroring the intrinsic nature of\\nnonlinear optics.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T06:54:48Z\"}"}
