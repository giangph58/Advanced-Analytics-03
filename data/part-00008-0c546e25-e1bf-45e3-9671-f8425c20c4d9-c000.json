{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01394v1\", \"title\": \"Double unstable avoided crossings and complex domain patterns formation\\n  in spin-orbit coupled spin-1 condensates\", \"summary\": \"We analyze the impact of spin-orbit and Rabi couplings on the dynamical\\nstability of spin-orbit-coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates for\\nferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions. Determining the\\ncollective excitation spectrum through Bogoliubov-de-Gennes theory, we\\ncharacterize the dynamical stability regime via modulational instability. For\\nAFM interactions, the eigenspectrum reveals the presence of both stable and\\nunstable avoided crossings (UAC), with the first-excited branch undergoing a\\ndouble unstable avoided crossing. In contrast, with ferromagnetic interactions,\\nonly a single UAC, which occurs between the low-lying and first-excited\\nbranches, is observed. Furthermore, the eigenvectors demonstrate the transition\\nfrom density-like to spin-like behaviour, as the collective excitation shows\\nthe transition from stable to unstable mode for both the FM and AFM\\ninteractions. In the multi-band instability state, eigenvectors display\\nspin-density mixed mode, while they show spin-flip nature in the avoided\\ncrossing regime. Our analysis suggests that spin-orbit coupling enhances the\\ninstability gain, while Rabi coupling plays the opposite role. Finally, we\\ncorroborate our analytical findings of stable and unstable regimes through\\nnumerical simulations of the dynamical evolution of the condensates by\\nintroducing the perturbations upon quenching the trap strength. The dynamical\\nphases show the formation of complex domains with AFM interaction, which may be\\nattributed to the double unstable avoided crossings in such a system.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T06:19:52Z\"}"}
