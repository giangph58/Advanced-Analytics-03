{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05861v1\", \"title\": \"Sparse Bounded Hop-Spanners for Geometric Intersection Graphs\", \"summary\": \"We present new results on $2$- and $3$-hop spanners for geometric\\nintersection graphs. These include improved upper and lower bounds for $2$- and\\n$3$-hop spanners for many geometric intersection graphs in $\\\\mathbb{R}^d$. For\\nexample, we show that the intersection graph of $n$ balls in $\\\\mathbb{R}^d$\\nadmits a $2$-hop spanner of size $O^*\\\\left(n^{\\\\frac{3}{2}-\\\\frac{1}{2(2\\\\lfloor\\nd/2\\\\rfloor +1)}}\\\\right)$ and the intersection graph of $n$ fat axis-parallel\\nboxes in $\\\\mathbb{R}^d$ admits a $2$-hop spanner of size $O(n \\\\log^{d+1}n)$.\\n  Furthermore, we show that the intersection graph of general semi-algebraic\\nobjects in $\\\\mathbb{R}^d$ admits a $3$-hop spanner of size\\n$O^*\\\\left(n^{\\\\frac{3}{2}-\\\\frac{1}{2(2D-1)}}\\\\right)$, where $D$ is a parameter\\nassociated with the description complexity of the objects. For such families\\n(or more specifically, for tetrahedra in $\\\\mathbb{R}^3$), we provide a lower\\nbound of $\\\\Omega(n^{\\\\frac{4}{3}})$. For $3$-hop and axis-parallel boxes in\\n$\\\\mathbb{R}^d$, we provide the upper bound $O(n \\\\log ^{d-1}n)$ and lower bound\\n$\\\\Omega\\\\left(n (\\\\frac{\\\\log n}{\\\\log \\\\log n})^{d-2}\\\\right)$.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CG\", \"categories\": \"cs.CG,cs.DM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:40:14Z\"}"}
