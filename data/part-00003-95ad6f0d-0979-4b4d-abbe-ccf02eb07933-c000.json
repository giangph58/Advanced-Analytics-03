We study how the HHG is influenced by pre-excitation of the\\nmonolayer using resonant and near-resonant pulses in a pump-probe-like scheme.\\nThe resonant light creates high density exciton population. Due to ultrafast\\ndephasing caused by electron-electron scattering, the HHG is suppressed in the\\npresence of pre-excited carriers. In the case of near-resonant excitation with\\nphoton energy below the exciton transition, the dynamics of the observed\\nsuppression of the HHG yield contains a fast component which is a consequence\\nof momentum scattering at carriers, which are excited by two-photon transition\\nwhen the two pulses temporally overlap in the sample. This interpretation is\\nsupported by comparison of the experimental data with theoretical calculations\\nof two-photon absorption spectrum of MoS2 monolayer. This work demonstrates a\\npossibility to control HHG in lowdimensional materials on ultrashort timescales\\nby combining the driving strong-field pulse with a weak near-resonant light.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T13:30:15Z\"}"}
