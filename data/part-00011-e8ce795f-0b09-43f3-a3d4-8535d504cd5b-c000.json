We establish the existence of a compact\\nglobal attractor and prove the nonlinear instability of the homogeneous steady\\nstate under an inviscid instability condition. We also provide a dimensional\\nlower bound on the attractor. Alternatively, we prove that if the interaction\\nparameter is sufficiently small, the homogeneous steady state is globally\\nasymptotically stable.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T14:18:43Z\"}"}
