It relies\\non online measurements and limited model information, namely, the input-output\\nsensitivity. In practice, various issues including inaccurate modeling, lack of\\nobservation, or changing conditions can lead to sensitivity mismatches, causing\\nclosed-loop sub-optimality or even instability. To handle such uncertainties,\\nwe pursue robust feedback optimization, where we optimize the closed-loop\\nperformance against all possible sensitivities lying in specific uncertainty\\nsets. We provide tractable reformulations for the corresponding min-max\\nproblems via regularizations and characterize the online closed-loop\\nperformance through the tracking error in case of time-varying optimal\\nsolutions. Simulations on a distribution grid illustrate the effectiveness of\\nour robust feedback optimization controller in addressing sensitivity\\nmismatches in a non-stationary environment.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:36:25Z\"}"}
