{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02676v1\", \"title\": \"Snow: Self-organizing Broadcast Protocol for Cloud\", \"summary\": \"In large-scale distributed applications, efficient and reliable broadcast\\nprotocols are essential for node communication. Tree-based broadcast lacks\\nflexibility and may suffer performance degradation or even broadcast failure\\nwhen cluster membership changes. Gossip-based broadcast incurs high bandwidth\\noverhead and only provides probabilistic delivery guarantees. In tree-based\\nbroadcasting, when an internal node leaves, its child nodes need to reconnect\\nto a new parent. This process may introduce instability, leading to potential\\nmessage duplication and increased transmission latency. However, in cloud\\nenvironments, node departures and arrivals are common, causing frequent\\nperformance degradation in tree-based broadcasting. This paper introduces Snow,\\na self-organizing broadcast protocol designed for cloud environments. Instead,\\nit dynamically sends or forwards messages based on each node's membership view,\\nultimately forming a broadcast structure resembling a multi-way balanced\\ntree(the height difference of leaf nodes is at most 1). Our experimental\\nresults showed that Snow maintains message delivery reliability and latency\\nguarantees under node churn while maintaining low overhead without sending\\nunnecessary redundant messages.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:15:16Z\"}"}
