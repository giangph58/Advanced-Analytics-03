{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05106v1\", \"title\": \"SpeakEasy: Enhancing Text-to-Speech Interactions for Expressive Content\\n  Creation\", \"summary\": \"Novice content creators often invest significant time recording expressive\\nspeech for social media videos. While recent advancements in text-to-speech\\n(TTS) technology can generate highly realistic speech in various languages and\\naccents, many struggle with unintuitive or overly granular TTS interfaces. We\\npropose simplifying TTS generation by allowing users to specify high-level\\ncontext alongside their script. Our Wizard-of-Oz system, SpeakEasy, leverages\\nuser-provided context to inform and influence TTS output, enabling iterative\\nrefinement with high-level feedback. This approach was informed by two\\n8-subject formative studies: one examining content creators' experiences with\\nTTS, and the other drawing on effective strategies from voice actors. Our\\nevaluation shows that participants using SpeakEasy were more successful in\\ngenerating performances matching their personal standards, without requiring\\nsignificantly more effort than leading industry interfaces.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:13:49Z\"}"}
