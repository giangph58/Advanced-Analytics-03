In this study, we propose a\\nrotationally equivariant Spherical Convolutional Neural Network (sCNN)\\nframework tailored for neonatal dMRI. We predict the Fiber Orientation\\nDistribution (FOD) from multi-shell dMRI signals acquired with a reduced set of\\ngradient directions (30% of the full protocol), enabling faster and more\\ncost-effective acquisitions. We train and evaluate the performance of our sCNN\\nusing real data from 43 neonatal dMRI datasets provided by the Developing Human\\nConnectome Project (dHCP). Our results demonstrate that the sCNN achieves\\nsignificantly lower mean squared error (MSE) and higher angular correlation\\ncoefficient (ACC) compared to a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) baseline,\\nindicating improved accuracy in FOD estimation. Furthermore, tractography\\nresults based on the sCNN-predicted FODs show improved anatomical plausibility,\\ncoverage, and coherence compared to those from the MLP. These findings\\nhighlight that sCNNs, with their inherent rotational equivariance, offer a\\npromising approach for accurate and clinically efficient dMRI analysis, paving\\nthe way for improved diagnostic capabilities and characterization of early\\nbrain development.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T17:36:51Z\"}"}
