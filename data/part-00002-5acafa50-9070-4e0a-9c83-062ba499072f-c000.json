{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04771v1\", \"title\": \"Improving Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Language Models through\\n  Dialectic Reasoning Argumentations\", \"summary\": \"Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is key to enhancing large language\\nmodels (LLMs) to systematically access richer factual knowledge. Yet, using RAG\\nbrings intrinsic challenges, as LLMs must deal with potentially conflicting\\nknowledge, especially in multilingual retrieval, where the heterogeneity of\\nknowledge retrieved may deliver different outlooks. To make RAG more\\nanalytical, critical and grounded, we introduce Dialectic-RAG (DRAG), a modular\\napproach guided by Argumentative Explanations, i.e., structured reasoning\\nprocess that systematically evaluates retrieved\\n  information by comparing, contrasting, and resolving conflicting\\nperspectives. Given a query and a set of multilingual related documents, DRAG\\nselects and exemplifies relevant knowledge for delivering dialectic\\nexplanations that, by critically weighing opposing arguments and filtering\\nextraneous content, clearly determine the final response. Through a series of\\nin-depth experiments, we show the impact of our framework both as an in-context\\nlearning strategy and for constructing demonstrations to instruct smaller\\nmodels. The final results demonstrate that DRAG significantly improves RAG\\napproaches, requiring low-impact computational effort and providing robustness\\nto knowledge perturbations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T06:55:15Z\"}"}
