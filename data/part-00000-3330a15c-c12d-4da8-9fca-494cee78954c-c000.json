{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24066v1\", \"title\": \"Smooth and rough paths in mean derivative estimation for functional data\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, in a multivariate setting we derive near optimal rates of\\nconvergence in the minimax sense for estimating partial derivatives of the mean\\nfunction for functional data observed under a fixed synchronous design over\\nH\\\\\\\"older smoothness classes. We focus on the supremum norm since it corresponds\\nto the visualisation of the estimation error, and is closely related to the\\nconstruction of uniform confidence bands. In contrast to mean function\\nestimation, for derivative estimation the smoothness of the paths of the\\nprocesses is crucial for the rates of convergence. On the one hand, if the\\npaths have higher-order smoothness than the order of the partial derivative to\\nbe estimated, the parametric $\\\\sqrt n$ rate can be achieved under sufficiently\\ndense design. On the other hand, for processes with rough paths of lower-order\\nsmoothness, we show that the rates of convergence are necessarily slower than\\nthe parametric rate, and determine a near-optimal rate at which estimation is\\nstill possible. We implement a multivariate local polynomial derivative\\nestimator and illustrate its finite-sample performance in a simulation as well\\nas for two real-data sets. To assess the smoothness of the sample paths in the\\napplications we further discuss a method based on comparing restricted\\nestimates of the partial derivatives of the covariance kernel.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:24:48Z\"}"}
