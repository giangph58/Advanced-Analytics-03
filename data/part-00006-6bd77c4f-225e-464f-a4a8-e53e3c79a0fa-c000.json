We\\nhere explore the problem of networks' topological predictability, i.e. the\\ndependence of their structure on the traffic level, but the apparent absence of\\nsignificant inter-day variability. By considering smaller spatial scales, we\\nshow that the sub-networks corresponding to individual FIRs are highly\\nheterogeneous and of low predictability; this is nevertheless modulated by the\\nstructure of airways, and specifically by the complexity in airspace usage. We\\nfurther discuss initial results of the evolution of such properties across\\nmultiple spatial scales; and draw conclusions on the operational implications,\\nspecifically on efforts to limit downstream effects.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T10:56:54Z\"}"}
