At the moment inverse design is generally accomplished by either\\nconstraining the training data set or producing a vast number of samples from a\\ngenerator network and constraining the output via post-processing. We show that\\na general adversarial network trained to produce crystal structures from a\\nlatent space can be fine tuned through the introduction of advanced graph\\nneural networks as discriminators, including a universal force field, to\\nintrinsically bias the network towards generation of target materials. This is\\nexemplified utilizing two-dimensional topological insulators as a sample target\\nspace. While a number of two-dimensional topological insulators have been\\npredicted, the size of the band-gap, a measure of topological protection,\\nremains a concern in most candidate compounds. The resulting generative network\\nis shown to yield novel topological insulators.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.dis-nn,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:25:44Z\"}"}
