{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05662v1\", \"title\": \"Reconstruction-Free Anomaly Detection with Diffusion Models via Direct\\n  Latent Likelihood Evaluation\", \"summary\": \"Diffusion models, with their robust distribution approximation capabilities,\\nhave demonstrated excellent performance in anomaly detection. However,\\nconventional reconstruction-based approaches rely on computing the\\nreconstruction error between the original and denoised images, which requires\\ncareful noise-strength tuning and over ten network evaluations per\\ninput-leading to significantly slower detection speeds. To address these\\nlimitations, we propose a novel diffusion-based anomaly detection method that\\ncircumvents the need for resource-intensive reconstruction. Instead of\\nreconstructing the input image, we directly infer its corresponding latent\\nvariables and measure their density under the Gaussian prior distribution.\\nRemarkably, the prior density proves effective as an anomaly score even when\\nusing a short partial diffusion process of only 2-5 steps. We evaluate our\\nmethod on the MVTecAD dataset, achieving an AUC of 0.991 at 15 FPS, thereby\\nsetting a new state-of-the-art speed-AUC anomaly detection trade-off.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T04:23:43Z\"}"}
