We give conditions on the\\nFourier transform of its density for functionals of the form\\n$H(a)=\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^n}h(\\\\langle a,x\\\\rangle)\\\\mu^n(dx)$ to be Schur monotone.\\nAs applications, we put certain known and new results under the same umbrella,\\ngiven by a condition on the Fourier transform of the density. These results\\ninclude certain moment comparisons for independent and identically distributed\\nrandom vectors, when the norm is given by intersection bodies, and the\\ncorresponding vector Khinchin inequalities. We also extend the discussion to\\nhigher dimensions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T16:16:55Z\"}"}
