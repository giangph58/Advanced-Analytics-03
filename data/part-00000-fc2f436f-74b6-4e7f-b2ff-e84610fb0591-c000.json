Some have described it as yeeting their back-breaking products of labor\\ninto the void, wishing they could never deal with them ever again. The very act\\nof yeeting papers onto arXiv contributes to the expansion of the arXiverse;\\nhowever, we have yet to quantify our contribution to the cause. In this work, I\\ninvestigate the expansion of the arXiverse using the arXiv astro-ph submission\\ndata from 1992 to date. I coin the term \\\"the arXiverse constant\\\", $a_0$, to\\nquantify the rate of expansion of the arXiverse. I find that astro-ph as a\\nwhole has a positive $a_0$, but this does not always hold true for the six\\nsubcategories of astro-ph. I then investigate the temporal changes in $a_0$ for\\nthe astro-ph subcategories and astro-ph as a whole, from which I infer the fate\\nof the arXiverse.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.pop-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.pop-ph,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T11:15:30Z\"}"}
