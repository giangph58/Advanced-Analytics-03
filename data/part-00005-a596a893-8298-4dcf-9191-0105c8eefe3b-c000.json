{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07609v1\", \"title\": \"Towards a Computational Quantum Logic: An Overview of an Ongoing\\n  Research Program\", \"summary\": \"This invited paper presents an overview of an ongoing research program aimed\\nat extending the Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence to quantum computation. We\\nexplore two key frameworks that provide both logical and computational\\nfoundations for quantum programming languages. The first framework, the\\nLambda-$S$ calculus, extends the lambda calculus by incorporating quantum\\nsuperposition, enforcing linearity, and ensuring unitarity, to model quantum\\ncontrol. Its categorical semantics establishes a structured connection between\\nclassical and quantum computation through an adjunction between Cartesian\\nclosed categiries and additive symmetric monoidal closed categories. The second\\nframework, the $\\\\mathcal L^{\\\\mathbb C}$ calculus, introduces a proof language\\nfor intuitionistic linear logic augmented with sum and scalar operations. This\\nenables the formal encoding of quantum superpositions and measurements, leading\\nto a computational model grounded in categorical structures with biproducts.\\nThese approaches suggest a fundamental duality between quantum computation and\\nlinear logic, highlighting structural correspondences between logical proofs\\nand quantum programs. We discuss ongoing developments, including extensions to\\npolymorphism, categorical and realizability models, as well as the integration\\nof the modality !, which further solidify the connection between logic and\\nquantum programming languages.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LO\", \"categories\": \"cs.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T10:00:16Z\"}"}
