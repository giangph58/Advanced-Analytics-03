{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06790v1\", \"title\": \"Analog Computing with Microwave Networks\", \"summary\": \"Analog computing has been recently revived due to its potential for\\nenergy-efficient and highly parallel computations. In this paper, we\\ninvestigate analog computers that linearly process microwave signals, named\\nmicrowave linear analog computers (MiLACs), and their applications in signal\\nprocessing for communications. We model a MiLAC as a multiport microwave\\nnetwork with tunable impedance components, which enables the execution of\\nmathematical operations by reconfiguring the microwave network and applying\\ninput signals at its ports. We demonstrate that a MiLAC can efficiently compute\\nthe linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimator, widely used in\\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications beamforming and detection,\\nwith remarkably low computational complexity, unachievable through digital\\ncomputing. Specifically, the LMMSE estimator can be computed with complexity\\ngrowing with the square of its input size, rather than the cube, with\\nrevolutionary applications to gigantic MIMO beamforming and detection.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,eess.SP,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T11:29:39Z\"}"}
