{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21779v1\", \"title\": \"X$^{2}$-Gaussian: 4D Radiative Gaussian Splatting for Continuous-time\\n  Tomographic Reconstruction\", \"summary\": \"Four-dimensional computed tomography (4D CT) reconstruction is crucial for\\ncapturing dynamic anatomical changes but faces inherent limitations from\\nconventional phase-binning workflows. Current methods discretize temporal\\nresolution into fixed phases with respiratory gating devices, introducing\\nmotion misalignment and restricting clinical practicality. In this paper, We\\npropose X$^2$-Gaussian, a novel framework that enables continuous-time 4D-CT\\nreconstruction by integrating dynamic radiative Gaussian splatting with\\nself-supervised respiratory motion learning. Our approach models anatomical\\ndynamics through a spatiotemporal encoder-decoder architecture that predicts\\ntime-varying Gaussian deformations, eliminating phase discretization. To remove\\ndependency on external gating devices, we introduce a physiology-driven\\nperiodic consistency loss that learns patient-specific breathing cycles\\ndirectly from projections via differentiable optimization. Extensive\\nexperiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 9.93 dB PSNR\\ngain over traditional methods and 2.25 dB improvement against prior Gaussian\\nsplatting techniques. By unifying continuous motion modeling with hardware-free\\nperiod learning, X$^2$-Gaussian advances high-fidelity 4D CT reconstruction for\\ndynamic clinical imaging.
