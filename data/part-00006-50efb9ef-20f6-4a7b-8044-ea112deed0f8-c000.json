Their field of application is vast, including smart home\\napplications, Internet of Things (IoT), and short-range high throughput static\\nand dynamic inter-vehicular communication networks. Within such networks,\\nChannel State Information (CSI) provides a detailed view of the state of the\\ncommunication channel and represents the combined effects of multipath\\npropagation, scattering, phase shift, fading, and power decay. In this work, we\\ninvestigate the problem of jamming attack detection in static and dynamic\\nvehicular networks. We utilize ESP32-S3 modules to set up a communication\\nnetwork between an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and a Ground Control Station\\n(GCS), to experimentally test the combined effects of a constant jammer on\\nrecorded CSI parameters, and the feasibility of jamming detection through CSI\\nanalysis in static and dynamic communication scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:15:53Z\"}"}
