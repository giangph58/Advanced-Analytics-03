Common\\nrecommendation-centric approaches face challenges such as inappropriate\\nreliance or a lack of integration with users' decision-making processes. Here,\\nwe explore an alternative interaction model in which the AI outputs build upon\\nusers' own decision-making rationales. We compare this approach, which we call\\nExtendAI, with a recommendation-based AI. Participants in our mixed-methods\\nuser study interacted with both AIs as part of an investment decision-making\\ntask. We found that the AIs had different impacts, with ExtendAI integrating\\nbetter into the decision-making process and people's own thinking and leading\\nto slightly better outcomes. RecommendAI was able to provide more novel\\ninsights while requiring less cognitive effort. We discuss the implications of\\nthese and other findings along with three tensions of AI-assisted\\ndecision-making which our study revealed.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T10:48:17Z\"}"}
