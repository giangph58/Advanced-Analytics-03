Realizing two-qubit gates\\nin this platform is the next major step for realistic quantum information\\nprocessing. In this work, we demonstrate frequency- and time-domain coherent\\nmanipulation of multiple eNe charge qubits that are coupled by short-range\\ncharge interactions. Cross-resonance and bSWAP two-qubit gates are implemented,\\nlaying the foundation for universal quantum computing. An inter-qubit coupling\\nstrength exceeding 60~MHz has been observed, promising fast gate speed and\\nsuppressed infidelity. These results highlight the potential to scale up the\\neNe qubit platform toward universal quantum computing.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T05:27:23Z\"}"}
