With the\\nadvent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems, automated systematic\\nlong-term investing is now feasible. In this paper, we present DBOT, a system\\nwhose goal is to reason about valuation like Aswath Damodaran, who is a unique\\nexpert in the investment arena in terms of having published thousands of\\nvaluations on companies in addition to his numerous writings on the topic,\\nwhich provide ready training data for an AI system. DBOT can value any publicly\\ntraded company. DBOT can also be back-tested, making its behavior and\\nperformance amenable to scientific inquiry. We compare DBOT to its analytic\\nparent, Damodaran, and highlight the research challenges involved in raising\\nits current capability to that of Damodaran's. Finally, we examine the\\nimplications of DBOT-like AI agents for the financial industry, especially how\\nthey will impact the role of human analysts in valuation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI,q-fin.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T03:34:22Z\"}"}
