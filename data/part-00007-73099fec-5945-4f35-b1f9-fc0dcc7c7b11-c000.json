{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01654v1\", \"title\": \"Bubble Clustering Decoder for Quantum Topological Codes\", \"summary\": \"Quantum computers are highly vulnerable to noise, necessitating the use of\\nerror-correcting codes to protect stored data. Errors must be continuously\\ncorrected over time to counteract decoherence using appropriate decoders.\\nTherefore, fast decoding strategies capable of handling real-time syndrome\\nextraction are crucial for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing. In this\\npaper, we introduce the bubble clustering (BC) decoder for quantum surface\\ncodes, which serves as a low-latency replacement for MWPM, achieving\\nsignificantly faster execution at the cost of a slight performance degradation.\\nThis speed boost is obtained leveraging an efficient cluster generation based\\non bubbles centered on defects, and avoiding the computational overhead\\nassociated with cluster growth and merging phases, commonly adopted in\\ntraditional decoders. Our complexity analysis reveals that the proposed decoder\\noperates with a complexity on the order of the square of the number of defects.\\nFor moderate physical error rates, this is equivalent to linear complexity in\\nthe number of data qubits.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:02:34Z\"}"}
