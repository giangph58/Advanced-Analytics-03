Our main focus is on the properties of the mean-field limit and, in\\nparticular, on the nonuniqueness of stationary states. By extending classical\\nbifurcation analysis to include multichromatic interaction potentials and\\nrandom graph structures, we explicitly identify bifurcation points and relate\\nthem to the eigenvalues of the graphon integral operator. Furthermore, we\\ncharacterize the resulting McKean-Vlasov PDE as a gradient flow with respect to\\na suitable metric. We combine these theoretical results with the spectral\\nanalysis of the linearized McKean-Vlasov operator and extensive numerical\\nsimulations to gain insight into the stability and long-term behaviour of\\nstationary solutions. In addition, we provide strong evidence that (minus) the\\ninteraction energy of the interacting particle system serves as a natural order\\nparameter. In particular, beyond the transition point and for multichromatic\\ninteractions, we observe an energy cascade that is strongly linked to the\\ndynamical metastability of the system.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS,cs.NA,math-ph,math.MP,math.NA,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T16:04:23Z\"}"}
