The idea is\\nthat these rates could be used to validate implementations of boundary integral\\noperators and allow to test operators separately by choosing solutions where\\nparts of the Calder\\\\'on identities vanish. Our estimates rely on simple vector\\nnorms, and thus avoid the use of hard-to-compute norms and the residual\\ncomputation can be easily implemented in existing boundary element codes. We\\ntest the proposed Calder\\\\'on residuals as debugging tool by introducing\\nartificial errors into the Galerkin matrices of some of the boundary integral\\noperators for the Laplacian and time-harmonic Maxwell's equations. From this,\\nwe learn that our estimates are not sharp enough to always detect errors, but\\nstill provide a simple and useful debugging tool in many situations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T09:49:19Z\"}"}
