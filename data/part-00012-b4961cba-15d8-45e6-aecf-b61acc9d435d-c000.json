As an example, we study\\ntwo-parameter representations of the off-shell one- and two-loop box graphs in\\nexactly four-dimensional configuration space. Closing the integration contours\\nfor the MB parameters we transform these into double sums. Polygamma functions\\nin the MB representation of the double box and the occurrence of higher poles\\nare taken into account by parametric differentiation. Summing over any one of\\nthe counters results into a $_{p+1}F_p$ that we replace by its Euler integral\\nrepresentation. The process can be repeated a second time and results in a two-\\nor four-parameter Euler integral, respectively. We use intersection theory to\\nderive Pfaffian systems of equations on related sets of master integrals and\\nsolve for the box and double box integrals reproducing the known expressions.\\nFinally, we use a trick to re-derive the double box from a two-parameter Euler\\nintegral. This second computation requires only very little computing\\nresources.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:22:28Z\"}"}
