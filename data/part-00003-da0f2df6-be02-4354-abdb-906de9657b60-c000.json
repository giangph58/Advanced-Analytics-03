{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01820v1\", \"title\": \"Antenna Selection for Enhancing Privacy in Radar-Based Vital Sign\\n  Monitoring Systems\", \"summary\": \"Radar-based vital sign monitoring (VSM) systems have become valuable for\\nnon-contact health monitoring by detecting physiological activities, such as\\nrespiration and heartbeat, remotely. However, the conventional phased array\\nused in VSM is vulnerable to privacy breaches, as an eavesdropper can extract\\nsensitive vital sign information by analyzing the reflected radar signals. In\\nthis paper, we propose a novel approach to protect privacy in radar-based VSM\\nby modifying the radar transmitter hardware, specifically by strategically\\nselecting the transmit antennas from the available antennas in the transmit\\narray. By dynamically selecting which antennas connect or disconnect to the\\nradio frequency chain, the transmitter introduces additional phase noise to the\\nradar echoes, generating false frequencies in the power spectrum of the\\nextracted phases at the eavesdropper's receiver. The antenna activation pattern\\nis designed to maximize the variance of the phases introduced by antenna\\nselection, which effectively makes the false frequencies dominate the spectrum,\\nobscuring the actual vital sign frequencies. Meanwhile, the authorized\\nreceiver, having knowledge of the antenna selection pattern, can compensate for\\nthe phase noise and accurately extract the vital signs. Numerical experiments\\nare conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in\\nenhancing privacy while maintaining vital sign monitoring.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:28:07Z\"}"}
