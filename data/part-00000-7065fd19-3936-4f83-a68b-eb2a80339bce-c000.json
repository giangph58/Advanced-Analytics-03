Recent proposals toward dequantizing\\nvariational QML models for regression problems include approaches based on\\nkernel methods with carefully chosen kernel functions, approximated via Random\\nFourier Features (RFF). In this short note we show that for a wide range of\\ninstances, this approach can be simplified. More specifically, we show that the\\nkernels whose evaluation is approximated by RFF in this dequantization\\nalgorithm can in fact often be evaluated exactly and efficiently classically.\\nAs such, our results enhance the toolkit for kernel-based dequantization of\\nvariational QML.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T10:26:16Z\"}"}
