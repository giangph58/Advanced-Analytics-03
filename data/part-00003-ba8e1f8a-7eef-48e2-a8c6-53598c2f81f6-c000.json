Recently, such screening has been dramatically\\naccelerated by the invent of universal machine-learning interatomic potentials\\nthat offer first principles accuracy at orders of magnitude lower computational\\ncost. Their application to the screening of defects with desired properties or\\nto finding new stable compounds with high density of defects, however, has not\\nbeen explored. Here, we show that the universal machine-learning interatomic\\npotentials have reached sufficient accuracy to enable large-scale screening of\\ndefective materials. We carried out vacancy calculations for 86 259 materials\\nin the Materials Project database and analyzed the formation energies in terms\\nof oxidation numbers. We further demonstrate the application of these models\\nfor finding new materials at or below the convex hull of known materials and\\nfor simulated etching of low-dimensional materials.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T16:00:47Z\"}"}
