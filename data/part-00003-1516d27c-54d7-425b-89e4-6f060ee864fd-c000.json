The Euclidean sector defines a fully regular\\nmetric coupled to the Weyl vector field. The Euclidean action and entropy are\\ncomputed, with the latter following the simple $A/4$ form plus a term linear in\\nthe horizon radius, characteristic of Gauss-Bonnet couplings.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T02:50:31Z\"}"}
