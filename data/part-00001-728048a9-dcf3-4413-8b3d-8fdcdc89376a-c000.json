{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05807v1\", \"title\": \"Low-Complexity AoI-Optimal Status Update Control with Partial Battery\\n  State Information in Energy Harvesting IoT Networks\", \"summary\": \"For a two-hop IoT system consisting of multiple energy harvesting sensors, a\\ncache-enabled edge node, and multiple monitors, the status update control at\\nthe edge node, which has partial battery state information (pBSI) of the\\nsensors, is formulated as a pBSI problem. The concept of inferred pBSI is\\nintroduced to reduce the noiseless single-sensor pBSI problem to a Markov\\ndecision process with a moderate state-space size, enabling the optimal policy\\nto be obtained through a value iteration algorithm. A lower bound on the\\nexpected time-average on-demand age of information performance is established\\nfor the general single-sensor status update problem. For the single-sensor pBSI\\nproblem, a semi-closed-form policy called the current-next (CN) policy is\\nproposed, along with an efficient post-update value iteration algorithm with a\\nper-iteration time complexity proportional to the square of the battery\\ncapacity. A weighted-update-gain-competition (WUGC) approach is further\\nleveraged to extend the CN policy to the multi-sensor case. Numerical results\\nin the single-sensor case demonstrate the near-optimal performance of the CN\\npolicy across various energy arrival processes. Simulations for an IoT system\\nwith $100$ sensors reveal that the WUGC-CN policy outperforms the\\nmaximum-age-first policy and the random-scheduling-based CN policy under\\nBernoulli energy arrival processes.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,cs.SY,eess.SY,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T08:40:36Z\"}"}
