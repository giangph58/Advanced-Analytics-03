The number of measurable states and their precision offered by the\\nonboard vehicle sensor system are often constrained by cost. For instance,\\nmeasuring critical quantities such as the Vehicle Sideslip Angle (VSA) poses\\nsignificant commercial challenges using current optical sensors. This paper\\naddresses these limitations by focusing on the development of high-performance\\nvirtual sensors to enhance vehicle state estimation for active safety. The\\nproposed Uncertainty-Aware Hybrid Learning (UAHL) architecture integrates a\\nmachine learning model with vehicle motion models to estimate VSA directly from\\nonboard sensor data. A key aspect of the UAHL architecture is its focus on\\nuncertainty quantification for individual model estimates and hybrid fusion.\\nThese mechanisms enable the dynamic weighting of uncertainty-aware predictions\\nfrom machine learning and vehicle motion models to produce accurate and\\nreliable hybrid VSA estimates. This work also presents a novel dataset named\\nReal-world Vehicle State Estimation Dataset (ReV-StED), comprising synchronized\\nmeasurements from advanced vehicle dynamic sensors. The experimental results\\ndemonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method for VSA estimation,\\nhighlighting UAHL as a promising architecture for advancing virtual sensors and\\nenhancing active safety in autonomous vehicles.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:49:58Z\"}"}
