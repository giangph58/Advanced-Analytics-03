{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05072v1\", \"title\": \"$Q_B$-Optimal Two-Level Designs\", \"summary\": \"Two-level designs are widely used for screening experiments where the goal is\\nto identify a few active factors which have major effects. Orthogonal two-level\\ndesigns in which all factors are level-balance and each of the four level\\ncombinations of any pair of factors appears equally often are commonly used. In\\nthis paper, we apply the model-robust $Q_B$ criterion introduced by Tsai,\\nGilmour and Mead (2007) to the selection of optimal two-level screening designs\\nwithout the requirements of level-balance and pairwise orthogonality. The\\ncriterion incorporates experimenter's prior belief on how likely a factor is to\\nbe active and recommends different designs under different priors, and without\\nthe requirement of level-balance and pairwise orthogonality, a wider range of\\ndesigns is possible. A coordinate exchange algorithm is developed for the\\nconstruction of $Q_B$-optimal designs for given priors.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:38:39Z\"}"}
