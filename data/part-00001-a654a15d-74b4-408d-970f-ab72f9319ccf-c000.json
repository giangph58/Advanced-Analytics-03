{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07435v1\", \"title\": \"Opportunity-Cost-Driven Reward Mechanisms for Crowd-Sourced Computing\\n  Platforms\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces a game-theoretic model tailored for reward distribution\\non crowd-sourced computing platforms. It explores a repeated game framework\\nwhere miners, as computation providers, decide their computation power\\ncontribution in each round, guided by the platform's designed reward\\ndistribution mechanism. The reward for each miner in every round is based on\\nthe platform's randomized task payments and the miners' computation\\ntranscripts. Specifically, it defines Opportunity-Cost-Driven Incentive\\nCompatibility (OCD-IC) and Dynamic OCD-IC (DOCD-IC) for scenarios where\\nstrategic miners might allocate some computation power to more profitable\\nactivities, such as Bitcoin mining. The platform must also achieve Budget\\nBalance (BB), aiming for a non-negative total income over the long term. This\\npaper demonstrates that traditional Pay-Per-Share (PPS) reward schemes require\\nassumptions about task demand and miners' opportunity costs to ensure OCD-IC\\nand BB, yet they fail to satisfy DOCD-IC. The paper then introduces\\nPay-Per-Share with Subsidy (PPSS), a new reward mechanism that allows the\\nplatform to provide subsidies to miners, thus eliminating the need for\\nassumptions on opportunity cost to achieve OCD-IC, DOCD-IC, and long-term BB.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GT\", \"categories\": \"cs.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T04:05:48Z\"}"}
