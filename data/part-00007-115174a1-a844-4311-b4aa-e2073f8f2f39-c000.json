In this work, we investigate how human-like\\npersonality traits influence agent behavior and performance within text-based\\ninteractive environments. We introduce PANDA: PersonalityAdapted Neural\\nDecision Agents, a novel method for projecting human personality traits onto\\nagents to guide their behavior. To induce personality in a text-based game\\nagent, (i) we train a personality classifier to identify what personality type\\nthe agent's actions exhibit, and (ii) we integrate the personality profiles\\ndirectly into the agent's policy-learning pipeline. By deploying agents\\nembodying 16 distinct personality types across 25 text-based games and\\nanalyzing their trajectories, we demonstrate that an agent's action decisions\\ncan be guided toward specific personality profiles. Moreover, certain\\npersonality types, such as those characterized by higher levels of Openness,\\ndisplay marked advantages in performance. These findings underscore the promise\\nof personality-adapted agents for fostering more aligned, effective, and\\nhuman-centric decision-making in interactive environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:17:00Z\"}"}
