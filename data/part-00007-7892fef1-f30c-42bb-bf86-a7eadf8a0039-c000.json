Our approaches are based on the method\\nusing fixed point theory, which do not resort to any Lyapunov functions or\\nLyapunov functionals. Our conditions do not require the differentiability of\\ndelays, nor do they ask for a fixed sign on the coefficient functions. Our\\nresults improve some previous ones in the literature. Examples are given to\\nillustrate our main results.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T07:22:03Z\"}"}
