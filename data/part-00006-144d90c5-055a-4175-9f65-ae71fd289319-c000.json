In the context of Black Holes (BHs), Quasi-Normal Modes\\n(QNMs) were shown to be linked to both the shadows, in the so-called eikonal\\nlimit, and Gray-Body Factors (GBFs), using the WKB approximation. We test the\\naccuracy of the quasinormal modes-graybody factors correspondence's in the\\ncontext of the Hawking spectra for static and rotating black hole\\nconfigurations, with particular attention to the superradiant regime. Our\\nanalysis reveals the correspondence failure to accurately reproduce the Hawking\\nspectrum due to divergences. Furthermore, we bridge the gap between black\\nshadows and graybody factors by drawing a correspondence between such\\nquantities in the case of generic static and spherically symmetric spacetime\\nconfigurations. The shadow-GBF correspondence is tested for some case studies,\\nincluding regular BHs, and its limitations and applicability are thereof\\ndiscussed. This study opens new perspectives, by introducing a new\\ncorrespondence and remarking on the caution needed when considering these\\nconnections.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.HE,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T17:10:46Z\"}"}
