In this work, we run a\\nsuite of simulations using the code 21cmSPACE, to explore the astrophysical\\nproperties of galaxies in the early Universe, and their impact on high-redshift\\nobservables. We use multi-wavelength observational data including the global\\n21-cm signal and power spectrum limits from SARAS~3 and HERA respectively,\\npresent-day diffuse X-ray and radio backgrounds, and UV luminosity functions\\n(UVLFs) from HST and JWST in the range $z=6-14.5$ to derive our constraints. We\\nconstrain a flexible model of halo-mass and redshift dependent star-formation\\nefficiency (SFE), defined as the gas fraction converted into stars, and find\\nthat it is best described by little to no redshift evolution at $z\\\\approx6-10$\\nand rapid evolution at $z\\\\approx10-15$. We derive Bayesian functional posterior\\ndistributions for the SFE across this redshift range, inferring that a halo of\\nmass $M_h=10^{10}\\\\text{M}_\\\\odot$ has an efficiency of $2-3\\\\%$ at $z\\\\lesssim10$,\\n$12\\\\%$ at $z=12$ and $26\\\\%$ at $z=15$. We also find, through synergy between\\nSARAS~3 and UVLFs, that the minimum circular velocity for star-formation in\\nhalos is $V_c = 16.9^{+25.7}_{-9.5}\\\\text{km s}^{-1}$ or equivalently\\n$\\\\log_{10}(M_\\\\text{crit}/\\\\text{M}_\\\\odot) = 8.29^{+1.21}_{-1.08}$ at $z=6$.\\nAlongside these star-formation constraints, we find the X-ray and radio\\nefficiencies of early galaxies to be $f_X = 0.5^{+6.3}_{-0.3}$ and $f_r\\n\\\\lesssim 11.7$ respectively, improving upon existing works that do not use UVLF\\ndata. Our results demonstrate the critical role of UVLFs in constraining the\\nearly Universe, and its synergies with 21-cm observations, alongside other\\nmulti-wavelength observational datasets.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T16:54:22Z\"}"}
