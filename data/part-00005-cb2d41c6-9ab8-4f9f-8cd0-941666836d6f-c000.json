{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05035v1\", \"title\": \"Probabilistic Position-Aided Beam Selection for mmWave MIMO Systems\", \"summary\": \"Millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems rely on highly directional beamforming\\nto overcome severe path loss and ensure robust communication links. However,\\nselecting the optimal beam pair efficiently remains a challenge due to the\\nlarge search space and the overhead of conventional methods. This paper\\nproposes a probabilistic position-aided beam selection approach that exploits\\nthe statistical dependence between user equipment (UE) positions and optimal\\nbeam indices. We model the underlying joint probability mass function (PMF) of\\nthe positions and the beam indices as a low-rank tensor and estimate its\\nparameters from training data using Bayesian inference. The estimated model is\\nthen used to predict the best (or a list of the top) beam pair indices for new\\nUE positions. The proposed method is evaluated using data generated from a\\nstate-of-the-art ray tracing simulator and compared with neural network-based\\nand fingerprinting approaches. The results show that our approach achieves a\\nhigh data rate with fewer training samples and a significantly reduced beam\\nsearch space. These advantages render it a promising solution for practical\\nmmWave MIMO deployments, reducing the beam search overhead while maintaining a\\nreliable connectivity.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:56:51Z\"}"}
