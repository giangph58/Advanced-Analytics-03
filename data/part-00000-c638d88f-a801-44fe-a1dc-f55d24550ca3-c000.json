In particular, some solutions exhibit slower decay\\ncompared to the case without the oscillatory component.\\n  Our proof relies on Fourier analysis and a representation of solutions in\\npolar coordinates, reducing the problem to a detailed study of the asymptotic\\nbehavior of solutions to a family of ordinary differential equations and\\nsuitable oscillatory integrals.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T08:50:23Z\"}"}
