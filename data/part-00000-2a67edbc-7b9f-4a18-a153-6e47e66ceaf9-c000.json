{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24384v1\", \"title\": \"High Energy Emission from the Intrabinary Shocks in Redback Pulsars\", \"summary\": \"The intrabinary shocks (IBS) of spider pulsars emit non-thermal synchrotron\\nX-rays from accelerated electrons and positrons in the shocked pulsar wind,\\nlikely energized by magnetic reconnection. In redback spider pulsars, the IBS\\ntypically wraps around the sub-stellar companion, leading to a near-normal IBS\\nshock with relatively bright X-ray emission. The characteristic energies of\\nradiating particles and the magnetic fields in the IBS suggest spectral\\nfeatures in the hard X-ray band. Here we perform joint soft-hard X-ray analyses\\nof three redback pulsars, J1723-2837, J2215+5135, and J2339-0533, including new\\nJ2215 NuSTAR data. We identify a significant cooling break in J1723-2837 and a\\nmarginal break in J2215+5135, while placing constraints on the break energy in\\nJ2339-0533. Interpreting these as synchrotron cooling features allows us to\\nestimate the IBS magnetic field $B_{\\\\rm IBS} \\\\sim 40-100$ G and place lower\\nbounds on the maximum radiating electron energy. Our results constrain the\\nmagnetization of the pulsar wind as well as pair-production in millisecond\\npulsar magnetospheres.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:59:46Z\"}"}
