{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23926v1\", \"title\": \"Reliable Traffic Monitoring Using Low-Cost Doppler Radar Units\", \"summary\": \"Road traffic monitoring typically involves the counting and recording of\\nvehicles on public roads over extended periods. The data gathered from such\\nmonitoring provides useful information to municipal authorities in urban areas.\\nThis paper presents a low-cost, widely deployable sensing subsystem based on\\nContinuous Wave Doppler radar. The proposed system can perform vehicle\\ndetection and speed estimation with a total cost of less than 100 USD. The\\nsensing system (including the hardware subsystem and the algorithms) is\\ndesigned to be placed on the side of the road, allowing for easy deployment and\\nserviceability.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T10:18:42Z\"}"}
