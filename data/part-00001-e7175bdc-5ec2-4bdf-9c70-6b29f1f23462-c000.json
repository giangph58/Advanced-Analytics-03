{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24225v1\", \"title\": \"Compressible N-phase fluid mixture models\", \"summary\": \"Fluid mixture models are essential for describing a wide range of physical\\nphenomena, including wave dynamics and spinodal decomposition. However, there\\nis a lack of consensus in the modeling of compressible mixtures, with limited\\nconnections between different classes of models. On the one hand, existing\\ncompressible two-phase flow models accurately describe wave dynamics, but do\\nnot incorporate phase separation mechanisms. On the other hand, phase-field\\ntechnology in fluid dynamics consists of models incorporating spinodal\\ndecomposition, however, a general phase-field theory for compressible mixtures\\nremains largely undeveloped.\\n  In this paper, we take an initial step toward bridging the gap between\\ncompressible two-phase flow models and phase-field models by developing a\\ntheory for compressible, isothermal N-phase mixtures. Our theory establishes a\\nsystem of reduced complexity by formulating N mass balance laws alongside a\\nsingle momentum balance law, thereby naturally extending the Navier-Stokes\\nKorteweg model to N-phases and providing the Navier-Stokes\\nCahn-Hilliard/Allen-Cahn model for compressible mixtures. Key aspects of the\\nframework include its grounding in continuum mixture theory and its\\npreservation of thermodynamic consistency despite its reduced complexity.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn,math-ph,math.AP,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:38:49Z\"}"}
