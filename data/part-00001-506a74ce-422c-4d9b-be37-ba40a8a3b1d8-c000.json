{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21770v1\", \"title\": \"Visual Jenga: Discovering Object Dependencies via Counterfactual\\n  Inpainting\", \"summary\": \"This paper proposes a novel scene understanding task called Visual Jenga.\\nDrawing inspiration from the game Jenga, the proposed task involves\\nprogressively removing objects from a single image until only the background\\nremains. Just as Jenga players must understand structural dependencies to\\nmaintain tower stability, our task reveals the intrinsic relationships between\\nscene elements by systematically exploring which objects can be removed while\\npreserving scene coherence in both physical and geometric sense. As a starting\\npoint for tackling the Visual Jenga task, we propose a simple, data-driven,\\ntraining-free approach that is surprisingly effective on a range of real-world\\nimages. The principle behind our approach is to utilize the asymmetry in the\\npairwise relationships between objects within a scene and employ a large\\ninpainting model to generate a set of counterfactuals to quantify the\\nasymmetry.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:59:33Z\"}"}
