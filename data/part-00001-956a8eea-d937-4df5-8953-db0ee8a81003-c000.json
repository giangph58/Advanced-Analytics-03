Having\\nknowledge of the total demand between various locations in the upcoming time\\nslots enables platforms to proactively prepare adequate supplies, thereby\\nincreasing the likelihood of fulfilling travelers' requests and redistributing\\nidle drivers to areas with high potential demand to optimize the global\\nsupply-demand equilibrium. This paper delves into the prediction of\\nOrigin-Destination (OD) demands at a fine-grained spatial level, especially\\nwhen confronted with an expansive set of local regions. While this task holds\\nimmense practical value, it remains relatively unexplored within the research\\ncommunity. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel prediction model called\\nOD-CED, which comprises an unsupervised space coarsening technique to alleviate\\ndata sparsity and an encoder-decoder architecture to capture both semantic and\\ngeographic dependencies. Through practical experimentation, OD-CED has\\ndemonstrated remarkable results. It achieved an impressive reduction of up to\\n45% reduction in root-mean-square error and 60% in weighted mean absolute\\npercentage error over traditional statistical methods when dealing with OD\\nmatrices exhibiting a sparsity exceeding 90%.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:52:27Z\"}"}
