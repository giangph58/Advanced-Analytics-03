We present idealloc, a\\nlow-fragmentation, high-performance DSA implementation designed for\\nmillion-buffer instances. Evaluated on a novel suite of particularly hard\\nbenchmarks from several domains, idealloc ranks first against four production\\nimplementations in terms of a joint effectiveness/robustness criterion.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.OS\", \"categories\": \"cs.OS,cs.AI,cs.PL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T09:28:54Z\"}"}
