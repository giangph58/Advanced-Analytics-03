{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02275v1\", \"title\": \"Enhancing Customer Contact Efficiency with Graph Neural Networks in\\n  Credit Card Fraud Detection Workflow\", \"summary\": \"Credit card fraud has been a persistent issue since the last century, causing\\nsignificant financial losses to the industry. The most effective way to prevent\\nfraud is by contacting customers to verify suspicious transactions. However,\\nwhile these systems are designed to detect fraudulent activity, they often\\nmistakenly flag legitimate transactions, leading to unnecessary declines that\\ndisrupt the user experience and erode customer trust. Frequent false positives\\ncan frustrate customers, resulting in dissatisfaction, increased complaints,\\nand a diminished sense of security. To address these limitations, we propose a\\nfraud detection framework incorporating Relational Graph Convolutional Networks\\n(RGCN) to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of identifying fraudulent\\ntransactions. By leveraging the relational structure of transaction data, our\\nmodel reduces the need for direct customer confirmation while maintaining high\\ndetection performance. Our experiments are conducted using the IBM credit card\\ntransaction dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T04:50:45Z\"}"}
