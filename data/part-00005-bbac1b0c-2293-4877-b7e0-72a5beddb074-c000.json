{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02355v1\", \"title\": \"Optical and magnetic response by design in GaAs quantum dots\", \"summary\": \"Quantum networking technologies use spin qubits and their interface to single\\nphotons as core components of a network node. This necessitates the ability to\\nco-design the magnetic- and optical-dipole response of a quantum system. These\\nproperties are notoriously difficult to design in many solid-state systems,\\nwhere spin-orbit coupling and the crystalline environment for each qubit create\\ninhomogeneity of electronic g-factors and optically active states. Here, we\\nshow that GaAs quantum dots (QDs) obtained via the quasi-strain-free local\\ndroplet etching epitaxy growth method provide spin and optical properties\\npredictable from assuming the highest possible QD symmetry. Our measurements of\\nelectron and hole g-tensors and of transition dipole moment orientations for\\ncharged excitons agree with our predictions from a multiband k.p simulation\\nconstrained only by a single atomic-force-microscopy reconstruction of QD\\nmorphology. This agreement is verified across multiple wavelength-specific\\ngrowth runs at different facilities within the range of 730 nm to 790 nm for\\nthe exciton emission. Remarkably, our measurements and simulations track the\\nin-plane electron g-factors through a zero-crossing from -0.1 to 0.3 and linear\\noptical dipole moment orientations fully determined by an external magnetic\\nfield. The robustness of our results demonstrates the capability to design -\\nprior to growth - the properties of a spin qubit and its tunable optical\\ninterface best adapted to a target magnetic and photonic environment with\\ndirect application for high-quality spin-photon entanglement.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T07:43:01Z\"}"}
