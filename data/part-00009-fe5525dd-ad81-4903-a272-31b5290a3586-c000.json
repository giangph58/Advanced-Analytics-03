We consider the\\nmost general case of determining the radius when the distances are measured\\nwith errors and the sphere has random deviations from its ideal shape. For the\\nsolution, we used the minimally necessary four points and an arbitrary N number\\nof points. We provide a new closed form solution for the radius of the sphere\\nthrough the matrix of pairwise distances. We also determine the standard\\ndeviation of the radius estimate caused by measurement errors and deviations of\\nthe sphere from its ideal shape. We found optimal configurations of points on\\nthe sphere that provide the minimum standard deviation of the radius estimate.\\nThis paper describes our solution and provides all the mathematical\\nderivations. We share the implementation of our method as open source code at\\nhttps://github.com/boris-sukhovilov/Sphere_Radius.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CG\", \"categories\": \"cs.CG,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T07:15:15Z\"}"}
