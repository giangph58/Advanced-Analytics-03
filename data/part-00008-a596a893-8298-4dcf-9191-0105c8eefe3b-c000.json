{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07612v1\", \"title\": \"SaRoHead: A Dataset for Satire Detection in Romanian Multi-Domain News\\n  Headlines\", \"summary\": \"The headline is an important part of a news article, influenced by\\nexpressiveness and connection to the exposed subject. Although most news\\noutlets aim to present reality objectively, some publications prefer a humorous\\napproach in which stylistic elements of satire, irony, and sarcasm blend to\\ncover specific topics. Satire detection can be difficult because a headline\\naims to expose the main idea behind a news article. In this paper, we propose\\nSaRoHead, the first corpus for satire detection in Romanian multi-domain news\\nheadlines. Our findings show that the clickbait used in some non-satirical\\nheadlines significantly influences the model.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T10:03:29Z\"}"}
