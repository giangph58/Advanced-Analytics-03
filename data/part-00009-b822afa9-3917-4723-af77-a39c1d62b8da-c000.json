The history of social\\nchoice theory illustrates this: numerous normative criteria on voting rules\\nhave been proposed; however, disagreements persist regarding which criteria\\nshould take precedence. This study addresses the problem of ranking\\nalternatives based on the aggregation of opinions over criteria that the\\nalternatives might fulfill. Using the opinion aggregation model, we propose a\\nnew rule, termed the Intersection Initial Segment (IIS) rule, and characterize\\nit using five axioms: neutrality, independence of the worst set, independence\\nof the best set, weak intersection very important player, and independence of\\nnon-unanimous improvement. We illustrate our approach on a running example\\nwhere the objective is to rank voting rules, showing that our opinion\\naggregation model is particularly well-suited to this context, and that the IIS\\nrule is a counterpart to the method discussed in Nurmi's paper (2015).\", \"main_category\": \"econ.TH\", \"categories\": \"econ.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T08:31:33Z\"}"}
