Bertola for the nonlinear Schr\\\\\\\"odinger equation. According to\\nthis theory, Peregrine solitons can locally emerge in the semiclassical limit\\nof the nonlinear Schr\\\\\\\"odinger equation. Our objective is to determine whether\\nthe phenomenon of gradient catastrophe can occur in a class of architected\\nstructures designated as flexible mechanical metamaterials, both with and\\nwithout losses. We demonstrate theoretically and numerically that this\\nphenomenon can occur in a canonical example of such flexible mechanical\\nmetamaterial, a chain of rotating units, studied earlier for its ability to\\nsupport robust nonlinear waves such as elastic vector solitons. We find that in\\nthe presence of weak losses, the gradient catastrophe persists although the\\namplitude of extreme generated events is smaller and their onset is delayed\\ncompared to the lossless configuration.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.PS\", \"categories\": \"nlin.PS,physics.class-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T08:31:15Z\"}"}
