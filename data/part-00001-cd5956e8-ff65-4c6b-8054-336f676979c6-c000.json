{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23709v1\", \"title\": \"Expanding-and-Shrinking Binary Neural Networks\", \"summary\": \"While binary neural networks (BNNs) offer significant benefits in terms of\\nspeed, memory and energy, they encounter substantial accuracy degradation in\\nchallenging tasks compared to their real-valued counterparts. Due to the\\nbinarization of weights and activations, the possible values of each entry in\\nthe feature maps generated by BNNs are strongly constrained. To tackle this\\nlimitation, we propose the expanding-and-shrinking operation, which enhances\\nbinary feature maps with negligible increase of computation complexity, thereby\\nstrengthening the representation capacity. Extensive experiments conducted on\\nmultiple benchmarks reveal that our approach generalizes well across diverse\\napplications ranging from image classification, object detection to generative\\ndiffusion model, while also achieving remarkable improvement over various\\nleading binarization algorithms based on different architectures including both\\nCNNs and Transformers.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T04:13:33Z\"}"}
