{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06751v1\", \"title\": \"Visualisation of a multidimensional point cloud as a 3D swarm of avatars\", \"summary\": \"The article presents an innovative approach to the visualisation of\\nmultidimensional data, using icons inspired by Chernoff faces. The approach\\nmerges classical projection techniques with the assignment of particular data\\ndimensions to mimic features, capitalizing on the natural ability of the human\\nbrain to interpret facial expressions. The technique is implemented as a plugin\\nto the dpVision open-source image handling platform. The plugin allows the data\\nto be interactively explored in the form of a swarm of \\\"totems\\\" whose position\\nin hyperspace as well as facial features represent various aspects of the data.\\nSample visualisations, based on synthetic test data as well as the vinhoverde\\n15-dimensional database on Portuguese wines, confirm the usefulness of our\\napproach to the analysis of complex data structures.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T10:14:33Z\"}"}
