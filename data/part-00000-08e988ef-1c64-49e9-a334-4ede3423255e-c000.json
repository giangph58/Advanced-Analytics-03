{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23764v1\", \"title\": \"WaveFormer: A 3D Transformer with Wavelet-Driven Feature Representation\\n  for Efficient Medical Image Segmentation\", \"summary\": \"Transformer-based architectures have advanced medical image analysis by\\neffectively modeling long-range dependencies, yet they often struggle in 3D\\nsettings due to substantial memory overhead and insufficient capture of\\nfine-grained local features. We address these limi- tations with WaveFormer, a\\nnovel 3D-transformer that: i) leverages the fundamental frequency-domain\\nproperties of features for contextual rep- resentation, and ii) is inspired by\\nthe top-down mechanism of the human visual recognition system, making it a\\nbiologically motivated architec- ture. By employing discrete wavelet\\ntransformations (DWT) at multiple scales, WaveFormer preserves both global\\ncontext and high-frequency de- tails while replacing heavy upsampling layers\\nwith efficient wavelet-based summarization and reconstruction. This\\nsignificantly reduces the number of parameters, which is critical for\\nreal-world deployment where compu- tational resources and training times are\\nconstrained. Furthermore, the model is generic and easily adaptable to diverse\\napplications. Evaluations on BraTS2023, FLARE2021, and KiTS2023 demonstrate\\nperformance on par with state-of-the-art methods while offering substantially\\nlower computational complexity.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T06:28:41Z\"}"}
