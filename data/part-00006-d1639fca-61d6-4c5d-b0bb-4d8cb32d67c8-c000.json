To\\ndescribe such phenomena and to give a lower bound on the energy required, we\\ngeneralize the existing concepts of chain recurrence. In fact, this paper\\nintroduces concepts of ``coarse chain recurrences'' and Morse graphs with\\nfinite errors. Using these concepts, we describe toy models of escape from\\nattracting basins and elimination of stagnation by controls using finite\\nenergy, persistence of recurrent points, and singular limit behaviors where\\nenergy injections go to zero. Furthermore, we construct filtrations associated\\nwith dynamical systems, which indicate the persistence of circulations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T03:18:34Z\"}"}
