This work takes\\nthe first step to guarantee secrecy for all users where a low resolution\\nintelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) is used to enhance legitimate users'\\nreception and thwart the potential eavesdropper (Eve) from intercepting. In\\nreal-life scenarios, due to hardware limitations of the IRS' passive reflective\\nelements (PREs), the use of a full-resolution (continuous) phase shift (CPS) is\\nimpractical. In this paper, we thus consider a more practical case where the\\nphase shift (PS) is modeled by a low-resolution (quantized) phase shift (QPS)\\nwhile addressing the phase shift error (PSE) induced by the imperfect channel\\nstate information (CSI). To that end, we aim to maximize the minimum secrecy\\nrate (SR) among all users by jointly optimizing the transmitter's beamforming\\nvector and the IRS's passive reflective elements (PREs) under\\nperfect/imperfect/unknown CSI. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex\\nand even more complicated under imperfect/unknown CSI.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:18:03Z\"}"}
