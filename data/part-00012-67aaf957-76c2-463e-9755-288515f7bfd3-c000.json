The system is described by an extended Hubbard\\nmodel including several Coulomb repulsions between neighboring sites. With the\\nrepulsion parameters, which have been proven to be suitable for low-energy\\nconsideration of graphene, we find a spin bond-ordered phase in the vicinity of\\nthe VHS. This phase gives way to a spin-density wave phase when involving a\\nweak additional screening. The ground-state phase diagram is presented in the\\nspace of the doping level and the screening parameter. We describe in detail\\nboth of these spin-ordered states by using recently developed TUFRG + MF\\nscheme, i.e., a combined approach of TUFRG and mean-field (MF) theory. The\\ncollinear states are energetically preferable in both cases of the spin bond\\norder and the spin-density wave. But if the third-nearest neighbor hopping is\\nabsent, these spin orders become chiral. The band structures of two collinear\\nspin-ordered states are presented, revealing the metallic behavior of the\\nsystem.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T07:52:02Z\"}"}
