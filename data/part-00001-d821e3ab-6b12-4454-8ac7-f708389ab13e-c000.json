{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01370v1\", \"title\": \"Accelerating Blockchain Scalability: New Models for Parallel Transaction\\n  Execution in the EVM\", \"summary\": \"As the number of decentralized applications and users on Ethereum grows, the\\nability of the blockchain to efficiently handle a growing number of\\ntransactions becomes increasingly strained. Ethereums current execution model\\nrelies heavily on sequential processing, meaning that operations are processed\\none after the other, which creates significant bottlenecks to future\\nscalability demands. While scalability solutions for Ethereum exist, they\\ninherit the limitations of the EVM, restricting the extent to which they can\\nscale. This paper proposes a novel solution to enable maximally parallelizable\\nexecutions within Ethereum, built out of three self-sufficient approaches.\\nThese approaches include strategies in which Ethereum transaction state\\naccesses could be strategically and efficiently predetermined, and further\\npropose how the incorporation of gas based incentivization mechanisms could\\nenforce a maximally parallelizable network.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC,cs.CE,cs.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T05:33:42Z\"}"}
