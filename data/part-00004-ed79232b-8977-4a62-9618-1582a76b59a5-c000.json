{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01724v1\", \"title\": \"DreamActor-M1: Holistic, Expressive and Robust Human Image Animation\\n  with Hybrid Guidance\", \"summary\": \"While recent image-based human animation methods achieve realistic body and\\nfacial motion synthesis, critical gaps remain in fine-grained holistic\\ncontrollability, multi-scale adaptability, and long-term temporal coherence,\\nwhich leads to their lower expressiveness and robustness. We propose a\\ndiffusion transformer (DiT) based framework, DreamActor-M1, with hybrid\\nguidance to overcome these limitations. For motion guidance, our hybrid control\\nsignals that integrate implicit facial representations, 3D head spheres, and 3D\\nbody skeletons achieve robust control of facial expressions and body movements,\\nwhile producing expressive and identity-preserving animations. For scale\\nadaptation, to handle various body poses and image scales ranging from\\nportraits to full-body views, we employ a progressive training strategy using\\ndata with varying resolutions and scales. For appearance guidance, we integrate\\nmotion patterns from sequential frames with complementary visual references,\\nensuring long-term temporal coherence for unseen regions during complex\\nmovements. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the\\nstate-of-the-art works, delivering expressive results for portraits,\\nupper-body, and full-body generation with robust long-term consistency.
