This problem can be casted\\nwithin a modified weighted pluripotential theoretic framework. Indeed, in the\\nproposed modification a vector valued weight is considered, allowing to\\npartially extend the main asymptotic results holding for interpolation of\\nscalar valued functions to the case of vector valued ones. As motivating\\nexample and main application we specialize our results to interpolation of\\ndifferential forms by differential forms with polynomial coefficients.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CV\", \"categories\": \"math.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T10:04:23Z\"}"}
