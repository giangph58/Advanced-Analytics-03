We derive necessary as well as\\nsufficient conditions for its validity in terms of higher-order monotonicity\\nproperties of $f$.\\n  Using the results so obtained we can derive sufficient conditions under which\\nthe inequality $${\\\\mathbb E} f(X)\\\\leq {\\\\mathbb E} f(Y)$$ is satisfied by all\\nfunctions which are simultaneously: $k_1$-increasing (or decreasing),\\n$k_2$-increasing (or decreasing), \\\\dots , $k_l$-increasing (or decreasing) for\\ngiven nonnegative integers $k_1,\\\\dots,k_l.$ This extends several well-known\\nresults on stochastic ordering.\\n  A necessary condition for the $(n,n+1,\\\\dots,m)$-increasing ordering is also\\npresented.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CA\", \"categories\": \"math.CA\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T16:48:37Z\"}"}
