{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06195v1\", \"title\": \"Accuracy Enhancement in Refractive Index Sensing via Full-Spectrum\\n  Machine Learning Modeling\", \"summary\": \"We present a full-spectrum machine learning framework for refractive index\\nsensing using simulated absorption spectra from meta-grating structures\\ncomposed of titanium or silicon nanorods under TE and TM polarizations. Linear\\nregression was applied to 80 principal components extracted from each spectrum,\\nand model performance was assessed using five-fold cross-validation, simulating\\nreal-world biosensing scenarios where unknown patient samples are predicted\\nbased on standard calibration data. Titanium-based structures, dominated by\\nbroadband intensity changes, yielded the lowest mean squared errors and the\\nhighest accuracy improvements: up to a 6065-fold reduction compared to the best\\nsingle-feature model. In contrast, silicon-based structures, governed by narrow\\nresonances, showed more modest gains due to spectral nonlinearity that limits\\nthe effectiveness of global linear models. We also show that even the best\\nsingle-wavelength predictor is identified through data-driven analysis, not\\nvisual selection, highlighting the value of automated feature preselection.\\nThese findings demonstrate that spectral shape plays a key role in modeling\\nperformance and that full-spectrum linear approaches are especially effective\\nfor intensity-modulated index sensors.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,physics.med-ph,q-bio.QM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T16:37:53Z\"}"}
