For $\\\\mathbf Q$ it\\nwas proved earlier by M. Fried. In this paper our objective is to determine\\n  how big the degree of such extension can be compared to the order of the\\nautomorphism group. A special case of our result shows that if the Inverse\\nGalois problem for $\\\\bq$\\n  has a solution for a finite group $G$, say of order $n$, then there exist\\nalgebraic number fields of degree $nm$, for any $m\\\\ge3$ with the same\\nautomorphism group $G$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T10:52:15Z\"}"}
