However, existing approaches often overlook the role\\ndistinctions within distributed databases and rely on small-scale models with\\nlimited generalization capabilities. In this paper, we conduct a preliminary\\nempirical study to emphasize the unique significance of different roles.\\nBuilding on this insight, we propose AgentFM, a role-aware failure management\\nframework for distributed databases powered by LLM-driven multi-agents. AgentFM\\naddresses failure management by considering system roles, data roles, and task\\nroles, with a meta-agent orchestrating these components. Preliminary\\nevaluations using Apache IoTDB demonstrate the effectiveness of AgentFM and\\nopen new directions for further research.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T06:18:24Z\"}"}
