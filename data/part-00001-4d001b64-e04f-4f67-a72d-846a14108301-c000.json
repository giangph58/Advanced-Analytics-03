{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05179v1\", \"title\": \"IEC-Independent Coupling Between Water Uptake and Ionic Conductivity in\\n  Anion-Conducting Polymer Films\", \"summary\": \"Anion exchange membranes (AEMs) are promising candidates for replacing proton\\nexchange membranes (PEMs) in electrochemical devices such as fuel cells,\\nelectrolyzers, batteries, and osmotic energy extraction systems. However,\\noptimizing the AEM design requires a deeper understanding of the ionic\\nconduction mechanism in the hydrated polymer matrix. This study investigates\\nthis mechanism by seeking to understand the relationship between ion exchange\\ncapacity (IEC), water absorption, and ionic conductivity in\\npolynorbornene-based thin films. We combine experimental measurements with\\ncomputational simulations using a newly developed minimal model of the polymer\\nfilm. Our model is able to reproduce key experimental observations, including\\nwater sorption isotherms and ion conduction behavior as a function of relative\\nhumidity, and successfully captures the relationship between them. By comparing\\nexperimental data with computational results, we explain the commonly reported\\ncorrelation between conductivity and hydration level and show how the\\ncorrelation between these variables is affected by the charge density and\\ntemperature of the material. Our research advances our understanding of the\\nphysical mechanisms that govern the performance of the polyelectrolyte\\nmembrane, which is essential for the development of more efficient, stable, and\\nenvironmentally friendly electrochemical systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T15:26:53Z\"}"}
