{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06060v1\", \"title\": \"Fast summation of fermionic Feynman diagrams beyond Bravais Lattices and\\n  on-site Hubbard interactions\", \"summary\": \"We designed new algorithms for summing bold-line Feynman diagrams in\\narbitrary channels, where it can be readily modified for bare interaction\\nseries as well. When applied to magnetic channel bold-line series with on-site\\nHubbard interactions, the algorithm achieves competitive performance compared\\nwith the state-of-art RPADet. We then generalize it beyond square lattice and\\non-site Hubbard interactions and achieve better scaling in the number of sites\\nwithin a unit cell, while there is substantial increase when there are more\\ntypes of interactions. This work paves the way of diagrammatic Monte Carlo\\nsimulations for real materials, holding the premise for a robust replacement of\\nstate-of-art simulation tools in the thermodynamical limit.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:04:46Z\"}"}
