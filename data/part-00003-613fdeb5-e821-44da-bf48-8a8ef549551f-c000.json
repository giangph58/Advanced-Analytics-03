We first show that there exists a tree $T$ such that its\\nmaximum degree $\\\\Delta(T)$ is at most $r$ and its spectrum radius $\\\\lambda(T)$\\nis equal to $\\\\alpha$ if and only if $\\\\alpha^{-1}\\\\in {\\\\mathscr W}_r(\\\\alpha)$. It\\nfollows that the set of spectrum radii of non-trivial trees is exactly the set\\nof positive numbers $\\\\alpha$ such that $\\\\alpha^{-1}\\\\in {\\\\mathscr\\nW}_{\\\\lfloor\\\\alpha^2\\\\rfloor}(\\\\alpha)$. Applying this conclusion, we then prove\\nthat for any positive integers $r$ and $k$, there exists a tree $T$ with\\n$\\\\Delta(T)=r$ and $\\\\lambda(T)=\\\\sqrt k$ if and only if $\\\\frac 14 k+1<r\\\\le k$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T06:30:32Z\"}"}
