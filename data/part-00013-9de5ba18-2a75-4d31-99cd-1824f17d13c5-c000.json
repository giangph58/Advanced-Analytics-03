When $M$ is\\ncontained in one of the two halfspaces determined by $C$, we give sufficient\\nconditions for $M$ to inherit the symmetries of $C$. In particular, when $M$ is\\nvertically cylindrically bounded, we get that $M$ is rotational if $C$ is a\\ncircle. In the case in which the Weingarten equation is linear, we give a\\nsufficient condition for such a surface to be contained in a halfspace. Both\\nresults are generalizations of results of Rosenberg and Sa Earp, for constant\\nmean curvature surfaces, to the Weingarten setting. In particular, our results\\nalso recover and generalize the constant mean curvature case.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T10:09:24Z\"}"}
