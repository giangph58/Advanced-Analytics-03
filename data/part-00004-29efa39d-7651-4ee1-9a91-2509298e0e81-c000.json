{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02519v1\", \"title\": \"Data-Driven Object Tracking: Integrating Modular Neural Networks into a\\n  Kalman Framework\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents novel Machine Learning (ML) methodologies for\\nMulti-Object Tracking (MOT), specifically designed to meet the increasing\\ncomplexity and precision demands of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS).\\nWe introduce three Neural Network (NN) models that address key challenges in\\nMOT: (i) the Single-Prediction Network (SPENT) for trajectory prediction, (ii)\\nthe Single-Association Network (SANT) for mapping individual Sensor Object (SO)\\nto existing tracks, and (iii) the Multi-Association Network (MANTa) for\\nassociating multiple SOs to multiple tracks. These models are seamlessly\\nintegrated into a traditional Kalman Filter (KF) framework, maintaining the\\nsystem's modularity by replacing relevant components without disrupting the\\noverall architecture. Importantly, all three networks are designed to be run in\\na realtime, embedded environment. Each network contains less than 50k trainable\\nparameters. Our evaluation, conducted on the public KITTI tracking dataset,\\ndemonstrates significant improvements in tracking performance. SPENT reduces\\nthe Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) by 50% compared to a standard KF, while SANT\\nand MANTa achieve up to 95% accuracy in sensor object-to-track assignments.\\nThese results underscore the effectiveness of incorporating task-specific NNs\\ninto traditional tracking systems, boosting performance and robustness while\\npreserving modularity, maintainability, and interpretability.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T12:13:38Z\"}"}
