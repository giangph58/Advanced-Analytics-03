{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05959v1\", \"title\": \"Old and New Results on Alphabetic Codes\", \"summary\": \"This comprehensive survey examines the field of alphabetic codes, tracing\\ntheir development from the 1960s to the present day. We explore classical\\nalphabetic codes and their variants, analyzing their properties and the\\nunderlying mathematical and algorithmic principles. The paper covers the\\nfundamental relationship between alphabetic codes and comparison-based search\\nprocedures and their applications in data compression, routing, and testing. We\\nreview optimal alphabetic code construction algorithms, necessary and\\nsufficient conditions for their existence, and upper bounds on the average code\\nlength of optimal alphabetic codes. The survey also discusses variations and\\ngeneralizations of the classical problem of constructing minimum average length\\nalphabetic codes. By elucidating both classical results and recent findings,\\nthis paper aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and students,\\nconcluding with promising future research directions in this still-active\\nfield.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,cs.DS,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:15:53Z\"}"}
