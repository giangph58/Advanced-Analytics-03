To gain deeper insights into the limitations of\\ndiffusion models in recommender systems, we investigate the fundamental\\nstructural disparities between images and items. Consequently, items often\\nexhibit distinct anisotropic and directional structures that are less prevalent\\nin images. However, the traditional forward diffusion process continuously adds\\nisotropic Gaussian noise, causing anisotropic signals to degrade into noise,\\nwhich impairs the semantically meaningful representations in recommender\\nsystems.\\n  Inspired by the advancements in hyperbolic spaces, we propose a novel\\n\\\\textit{\\\\textbf{H}yperbolic} \\\\textit{\\\\textbf{D}iffusion}\\n\\\\textit{\\\\textbf{R}ecommender} \\\\textit{\\\\textbf{M}odel} (named HDRM). Unlike\\nexisting directional diffusion methods based on Euclidean space, the intrinsic\\nnon-Euclidean structure of hyperbolic space makes it particularly well-adapted\\nfor handling anisotropic diffusion processes. In particular, we begin by\\nformulating concepts to characterize latent directed diffusion processes within\\na geometrically grounded hyperbolic space. Subsequently, we propose a novel\\nhyperbolic latent diffusion process specifically tailored for users and items.\\nDrawing upon the natural geometric attributes of hyperbolic spaces, we impose\\nstructural restrictions on the space to enhance hyperbolic diffusion\\npropagation, thereby ensuring the preservation of the intrinsic topology of\\nuser-item graphs. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate\\nthe effectiveness of HDRM.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T09:27:40Z\"}"}
