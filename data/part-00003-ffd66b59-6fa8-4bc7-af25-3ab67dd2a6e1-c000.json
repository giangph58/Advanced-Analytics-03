{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06264v1\", \"title\": \"D^2USt3R: Enhancing 3D Reconstruction with 4D Pointmaps for Dynamic\\n  Scenes\", \"summary\": \"We address the task of 3D reconstruction in dynamic scenes, where object\\nmotions degrade the quality of previous 3D pointmap regression methods, such as\\nDUSt3R, originally designed for static 3D scene reconstruction. Although these\\nmethods provide an elegant and powerful solution in static settings, they\\nstruggle in the presence of dynamic motions that disrupt alignment based solely\\non camera poses. To overcome this, we propose D^2USt3R that regresses 4D\\npointmaps that simultaneiously capture both static and dynamic 3D scene\\ngeometry in a feed-forward manner. By explicitly incorporating both spatial and\\ntemporal aspects, our approach successfully encapsulates spatio-temporal dense\\ncorrespondence to the proposed 4D pointmaps, enhancing downstream tasks.\\nExtensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our proposed approach\\nconsistently achieves superior reconstruction performance across various\\ndatasets featuring complex motions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T17:59:50Z\"}"}
