Here we consider a\\nscenario in which two species are dominant and one species is vanishingly\\nsmall. In this scenario two energy levels are distinguished: the zeroth-order\\nenergy encodes information on the optimal arrangement of the dominant\\nconstituents, while the first-order energy gives the shape of the vanishing\\nconstituent. This first-order energy also shows that, for any optimal\\nconfiguration, the vanishing phase must lie on the boundary between the two\\ndominant constituents and form lens clusters also known as vesica piscis.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T16:52:27Z\"}"}
