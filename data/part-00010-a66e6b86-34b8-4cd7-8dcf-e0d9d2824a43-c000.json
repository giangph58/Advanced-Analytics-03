We find a simple parameterisation of the subclass of causal\\ntheories. By construction of the stress-energy tensor from the Hamiltonian\\ndensity, we show that causality implies both the Dominant and Strong energy\\nconditions. We also revisit the Perry-Schwarz formulation, clarifying aspects\\nof it and of its relation to the Hamiltonian formulation.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:22:30Z\"}"}
