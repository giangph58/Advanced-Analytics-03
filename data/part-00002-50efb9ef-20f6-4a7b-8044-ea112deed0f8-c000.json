{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05828v1\", \"title\": \"Capacity Region for Covert Secret Key Generation over Multiple Access\\n  Channels\", \"summary\": \"We study covert secret key generation over a binary-input two-user multiple\\naccess channel with one-way public discussion and derive bounds on the capacity\\nregion. Specifically, in this problem, there are three legitimate parties:\\nAlice, Bob and Charlie. The goal is to allow Charlie to generate a secret key\\nwith Alice and another secret key with Bob, reliably, secretly and covertly.\\nReliability ensures that the key generated by Alice and Charlie is the same and\\nthe key generated by Bob and Charlie is the same. Secrecy ensures that the\\nsecret keys generated are only known to specific legitimate parties. Covertness\\nensures that the key generation process is undetectable by a warden Willie. As\\na corollary of our result, we establish bounds on the capacity region of\\nwiretap secret key generation without the covertness constraint and discuss the\\nimpact of covertness. Our results generalize the point-to-point result of\\nTahmasbi and Bloch (TIFS 2020) to the setting of multiterminal communication.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:08:45Z\"}"}
