Then seaweed\\nsubalgebras $\\\\mathfrak q\\\\subset\\\\mathfrak g$ were defined by Panyushev for any\\nreductive $\\\\mathfrak g$. A few years later Joseph generalised this notion to\\nthe setting of (untwisted) affine Kac--Moody algebras $\\\\widehat{\\\\mathfrak g}$.\\nFurthermore, he proved that the index of such a seaweed can be computed by the\\nsame formula that had been known for $\\\\mathfrak g$. In this paper, we construct\\ngraphs that help to understand the index of a seaweed $\\\\mathfrak\\nq\\\\subset\\\\widehat{\\\\mathfrak g}$, where $\\\\widehat{\\\\mathfrak g}$ is of affine type\\nA or C.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RT\", \"categories\": \"math.RT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T14:58:59Z\"}"}
