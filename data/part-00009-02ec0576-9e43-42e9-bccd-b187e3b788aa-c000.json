{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05219v1\", \"title\": \"An ensemble deep learning approach to detect tumors on Mohs micrographic\\n  surgery slides\", \"summary\": \"Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is the gold standard technique for removing\\nhigh risk nonmelanoma skin cancer however, intraoperative histopathological\\nexamination demands significant time, effort, and professionality. The\\nobjective of this study is to develop a deep learning model to detect basal\\ncell carcinoma (BCC) and artifacts on Mohs slides. A total of 731 Mohs slides\\nfrom 51 patients with BCCs were used in this study, with 91 containing tumor\\nand 640 without tumor which was defined as non-tumor. The dataset was employed\\nto train U-Net based models that segment tumor and non-tumor regions on the\\nslides. The segmented patches were classified as tumor, or non-tumor to produce\\npredictions for whole slide images (WSIs). For the segmentation phase, the deep\\nlearning model success was measured using a Dice score with 0.70 and 0.67\\nvalue, area under the curve (AUC) score with 0.98 and 0.96 for tumor and\\nnon-tumor, respectively. For the tumor classification, an AUC of 0.98 for\\npatch-based detection, and AUC of 0.91 for slide-based detection was obtained\\non the test dataset. We present an AI system that can detect tumors and\\nnon-tumors in Mohs slides with high success. Deep learning can aid Mohs\\nsurgeons and dermatopathologists in making more accurate decisions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,eess.IV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T16:05:42Z\"}"}
