This mechanism is best described\\nby the master equation for the density matrix of an open quantum system, which\\nincludes terms for Hamiltonian evolution, thermal spin relaxation, and chemical\\nkinetics. In this study, we have found a solution to this equation for a\\nsimplified radical pair model and shown that a significant magnetic effect\\noccurs when the following condition is met: $\\\\gamma H \\\\tau \\\\gtrsim 1 + \\\\kappa\\n\\\\tau$, where $\\\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio of the electron, $H$ is the\\nmagnetic field strength, $\\\\tau$ is the relaxation time, and $\\\\kappa$ is the\\nrate of chemical kinetics.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.bio-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.bio-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T06:52:41Z\"}"}
