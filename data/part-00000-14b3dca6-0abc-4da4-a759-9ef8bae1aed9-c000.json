However, the impact of GFM\\nconverters on the system stability is still unquantified, creating a gap\\nbetween the system- and device-level perspectives. To fill this gap, at the\\ndevice-level, we propose a Forming Index to quantify a converter's response to\\ngrid voltage variations, providing a characterization of its GFM behavior. At\\nthe system-level, a quantitative notion of System Strength is introduced to\\ncapture the fundamental requirements for power system formation. Finally, we\\nestablish the alignment between device- and system-level metrics by\\ndemonstrating that GFM converters provably enhance system strength.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:37:51Z\"}"}
