{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05122v1\", \"title\": \"DoCIA: An Online Document-Level Context Incorporation Agent for Speech\\n  Translation\", \"summary\": \"Document-level context is crucial for handling discourse challenges in\\ntext-to-text document-level machine translation (MT). Despite the increased\\ndiscourse challenges introduced by noise from automatic speech recognition\\n(ASR), the integration of document-level context in speech translation (ST)\\nremains insufficiently explored. In this paper, we develop DoCIA, an online\\nframework that enhances ST performance by incorporating document-level context.\\nDoCIA decomposes the ST pipeline into four stages. Document-level context is\\nintegrated into the ASR refinement, MT, and MT refinement stages through\\nauxiliary LLM (large language model)-based modules. Furthermore, DoCIA\\nleverages document-level information in a multi-level manner while minimizing\\ncomputational overhead. Additionally, a simple yet effective determination\\nmechanism is introduced to prevent hallucinations from excessive refinement,\\nensuring the reliability of the final results. Experimental results show that\\nDoCIA significantly outperforms traditional ST baselines in both sentence and\\ndiscourse metrics across four LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness in\\nimproving ST performance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:26:49Z\"}"}
