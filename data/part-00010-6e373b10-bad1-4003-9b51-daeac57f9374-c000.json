Unlike existing models,\\nSurvSurf is theoretically guaranteed to never violate the monotonic\\nrelationship between the cumulative incidence functions of sequential events,\\nwhile allowing nonlinear influence from predictors. It also incorporates\\nimplicit truths for unobserved intermediate events in model fitting, and\\nsupports both discrete and continuous time and events. We also identified a\\nvariant of the Integrated Brier Score (IBS) that showed robust correlation with\\nthe mean squared error (MSE) between the true and predicted probabilities by\\naccounting for implied truths about the missing intermediate events. We\\ndemonstrated the superiority of SurvSurf compared to modern and traditional\\npredictive survival models in two simulated datasets and two real-world\\ndatasets, using MSE, the more robust IBS and by measuring the extent of\\nmonotonicity violation.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ML\", \"categories\": \"stat.ML,cs.AI,cs.LG,math.ST,stat.AP,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:24:59Z\"}"}
