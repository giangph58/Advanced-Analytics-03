With the\\nadvancement in large text-to-image models, many techniques have been developed\\nto efficiently fine-tune those models for personalization, such as Low Rank\\nAdaptation (LoRA). However, LoRA-based methods often face the challenge of\\nadjusting the rank parameter to achieve satisfactory results. To address this\\nchallenge, AutoComponent-LoRA (AC-LoRA) is proposed, which is able to\\nautomatically separate the signal component and noise component of the LoRA\\nmatrices for fast and efficient personalized artistic style image generation.\\nThis method is based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and dynamic\\nheuristics to update the hyperparameters during training. Superior performance\\nover existing methods in overcoming model underfitting or overfitting problems\\nis demonstrated. The results were validated using FID, CLIP, DINO, and\\nImageReward, achieving an average of 9% improvement.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T02:56:01Z\"}"}
