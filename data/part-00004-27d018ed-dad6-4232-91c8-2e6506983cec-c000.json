For each\\ncolumn, sample independently one Bernoulli random variable of some parameter\\n$p$. Seeing all this and possibly using extra randomness, Alice then chooses\\none spot in each column, in any way she wants. When the Bernoulli random\\nvariable of some column is equal to 1, the number 1 is written in the chosen\\nspot. When the Bernoulli random variable of a column is 0, nothing is done on\\nthis column. We prove that, using extra randomness, it is possible for Bob to\\nfill the empty spots with well chosen 0's and 1's so that the entries of the\\nmatrix are independent Bernoulli random variables of parameter $p$. We\\ninvestigate various generalisations and variations of this problem, and use\\nthis result to revisit and generalise (nonstrict) monotonicity of the\\npercolation threshold $p_c$ with respect to some sort of graph-quotienting,\\nnamely fibrations.\\n  In a second part, which is independent of the first one, we revisit strict\\nmonotonicity of $p_c$ with respect to fibrations, a result that naturally\\nrequires more assumptions than its nonstrict counterpart. We reprove the\\nbond-percolation case of the result of Martineau--Severo without resorting to\\nessential enhancements, using couplings instead.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T09:31:59Z\"}"}
