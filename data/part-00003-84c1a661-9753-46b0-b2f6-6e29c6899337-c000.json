Not for SVP Hardness under ETH!\", \"summary\": \"We prove new hardness results for fundamental lattice problems under the\\nExponential Time Hypothesis (ETH). Building on a recent breakthrough by\\nBitansky et al. [BHIRW24], who gave a polynomial-time reduction from\\n$\\\\mathsf{3SAT}$ to the (gap) $\\\\mathsf{MAXLIN}$ problem-a class of CSPs with\\nlinear equations over finite fields-we derive ETH-hardness for several lattice\\nproblems.\\n  First, we show that for any $p \\\\in [1, \\\\infty)$, there exists an explicit\\nconstant $\\\\gamma > 1$ such that $\\\\mathsf{CVP}_{p,\\\\gamma}$ (the $\\\\ell_p$-norm\\napproximate Closest Vector Problem) does not admit a $2^{o(n)}$-time algorithm\\nunless ETH is false. Our reduction is deterministic and proceeds via a direct\\nreduction from (gap) $\\\\mathsf{MAXLIN}$ to $\\\\mathsf{CVP}_{p,\\\\gamma}$.\\n  Next, we prove a randomized ETH-hardness result for $\\\\mathsf{SVP}_{p,\\\\gamma}$\\n(the $\\\\ell_p$-norm approximate Shortest Vector Problem) for all $p > 2$. This\\nresult relies on a novel property of the integer lattice $\\\\mathbb{Z}^n$ in the\\n$\\\\ell_p$ norm and a randomized reduction from $\\\\mathsf{CVP}_{p,\\\\gamma}$ to\\n$\\\\mathsf{SVP}_{p,\\\\gamma'}$.\\n  Finally, we improve over prior reductions from $\\\\mathsf{3SAT}$ to\\n$\\\\mathsf{BDD}_{p, \\\\alpha}$ (the Bounded Distance Decoding problem), yielding\\nbetter ETH-hardness results for $\\\\mathsf{BDD}_{p, \\\\alpha}$ for any $p \\\\in [1,\\n\\\\infty)$ and $\\\\alpha > \\\\alpha_p^{\\\\ddagger}$, where $\\\\alpha_p^{\\\\ddagger}$ is an\\nexplicit threshold depending on $p$.\\n  We additionally observe that prior work implies ETH hardness for the gap\\nminimum distance problem ($\\\\gamma$-$\\\\mathsf{MDP}$) in codes.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CC\", \"categories\": \"cs.CC,cs.CR,cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:32:32Z\"}"}
