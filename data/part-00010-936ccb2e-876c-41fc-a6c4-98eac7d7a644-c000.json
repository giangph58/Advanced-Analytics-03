Although insights into\\neach of these areas have accumulated in sports science literature on football,\\nit remains unclear how one can enhance team performance. We analyse influence\\nof football players' behaviour on team performance in three-versus-one ball\\npossession game by constructing and analysing a dynamical model. We developed a\\nmodel for the motion of the players and the ball, which mathematically\\nrepresented our hypotheses on players' behaviour and interactions. The model's\\nplausibility was examined by comparing simulated outcomes with our experimental\\nresult. Possible influences of interventions were analysed through sensitivity\\nanalysis, where causal effects of several aspects of behaviour such as pass\\nspeed and accuracy were found. Our research highlights the potential of\\ndynamical modelling for uncovering influence of behaviour on team\\neffectiveness.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T04:29:33Z\"}"}
