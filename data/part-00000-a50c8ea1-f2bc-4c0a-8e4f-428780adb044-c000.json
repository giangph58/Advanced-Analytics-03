This order was first introduced\\nfor branching random walks with a constant breeding law and independent\\ndispersal of offspring, which are characterized by a one-dimensional generating\\nfunction. In this work, we investigate the properties of the extension of this\\nconcept to processes characterized by a multidimensional generating function,\\nsuch as general branching random walks and rumor processes. In particular, we\\nuse germ ordering to characterize the behavior of certain branching random\\nwalks and rumor processes with inhomogeneous breeding/transmitting laws.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:59:06Z\"}"}
