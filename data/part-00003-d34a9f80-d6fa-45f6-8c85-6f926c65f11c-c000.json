We consider factorizations with several factors in a purely\\ncategorical context, extending results of Sun and Zhang for Gorenstein\\nprojective module factorizations. Our formulation relies on a notion of\\nhypersurface category and replaces Gorenstein projectives by objects of general\\nFrobenius exact subcategories. We show that factorizations over such categories\\nform again a Frobenius category. Our main result is then a triangle equivalence\\nbetween the stable category of factorizations and that of chains of\\nmonomorphisms.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CT\", \"categories\": \"math.CT,math.AC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:55:13Z\"}"}
