Recently, three\\npublicly available tools, such as MRSegmentator (MRSeg), TotalSegmentator MRI\\n(TS), and TotalVibeSegmentator (VIBE), have been proposed for multi-organ\\nsegmentation in MRI. However, the performance of these tools on specific MRI\\nsequence types has not yet been quantified. In this work, a subset of 40\\nvolumes from the public Duke Liver Dataset was curated. The curated dataset\\ncontained 10 volumes each from the pre-contrast fat saturated T1, arterial T1w,\\nvenous T1w, and delayed T1w phases, respectively. Ten abdominal structures were\\nmanually annotated in these volumes. Next, the performance of the three public\\ntools was benchmarked on this curated dataset. The results indicated that MRSeg\\nobtained a Dice score of 80.7 $\\\\pm$ 18.6 and Hausdorff Distance (HD) error of\\n8.9 $\\\\pm$ 10.4 mm. It fared the best ($p < .05$) across the different sequence\\ntypes in contrast to TS and VIBE.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T13:27:27Z\"}"}
