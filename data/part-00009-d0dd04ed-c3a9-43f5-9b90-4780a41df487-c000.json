{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07853v1\", \"title\": \"V2V3D: View-to-View Denoised 3D Reconstruction for Light-Field\\n  Microscopy\", \"summary\": \"Light field microscopy (LFM) has gained significant attention due to its\\nability to capture snapshot-based, large-scale 3D fluorescence images. However,\\nexisting LFM reconstruction algorithms are highly sensitive to sensor noise or\\nrequire hard-to-get ground-truth annotated data for training. To address these\\nchallenges, this paper introduces V2V3D, an unsupervised view2view-based\\nframework that establishes a new paradigm for joint optimization of image\\ndenoising and 3D reconstruction in a unified architecture. We assume that the\\nLF images are derived from a consistent 3D signal, with the noise in each view\\nbeing independent. This enables V2V3D to incorporate the principle of\\nnoise2noise for effective denoising. To enhance the recovery of high-frequency\\ndetails, we propose a novel wave-optics-based feature alignment technique,\\nwhich transforms the point spread function, used for forward propagation in\\nwave optics, into convolution kernels specifically designed for feature\\nalignment. Moreover, we introduce an LFM dataset containing LF images and their\\ncorresponding 3D intensity volumes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\\napproach achieves high computational efficiency and outperforms the other\\nstate-of-the-art methods. These advancements position V2V3D as a promising\\nsolution for 3D imaging under challenging conditions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:29:26Z\"}"}
