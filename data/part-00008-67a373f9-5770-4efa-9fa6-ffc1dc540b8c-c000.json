{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06920v1\", \"title\": \"S-EO: A Large-Scale Dataset for Geometry-Aware Shadow Detection in\\n  Remote Sensing Applications\", \"summary\": \"We introduce the S-EO dataset: a large-scale, high-resolution dataset,\\ndesigned to advance geometry-aware shadow detection. Collected from diverse\\npublic-domain sources, including challenge datasets and government providers\\nsuch as USGS, our dataset comprises 702 georeferenced tiles across the USA,\\neach covering 500x500 m. Each tile includes multi-date, multi-angle WorldView-3\\npansharpened RGB images, panchromatic images, and a ground-truth DSM of the\\narea obtained from LiDAR scans. For each image, we provide a shadow mask\\nderived from geometry and sun position, a vegetation mask based on the NDVI\\nindex, and a bundle-adjusted RPC model. With approximately 20,000 images, the\\nS-EO dataset establishes a new public resource for shadow detection in remote\\nsensing imagery and its applications to 3D reconstruction. To demonstrate the\\ndataset's impact, we train and evaluate a shadow detector, showcasing its\\nability to generalize, even to aerial images. Finally, we extend EO-NeRF - a\\nstate-of-the-art NeRF approach for satellite imagery - to leverage our shadow\\npredictions for improved 3D reconstructions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:25:35Z\"}"}
