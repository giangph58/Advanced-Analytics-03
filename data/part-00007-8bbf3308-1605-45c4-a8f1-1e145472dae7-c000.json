For the focusing finitely coupled cubic nonlinear\\nSchr\\\\\\\"odinger system, we present a complete classification of minimal-mass\\nblowup solutions. Specifically, we demonstrate that all such solutions must be\\neither solitons or their pseudo-conformal transformations. To prove this\\nresult, we develop a modulation analysis that accounts for multi-component\\ninteractions to overcome the multiply phase transformations caused by the\\nmulti-component. A long time Strichartz estimate for vector-valued solutions is\\nestablished to solve the difficulty posed by the Galilean transformations and\\nspatial translation, where a new vector-valued bilinear estimate is proven to\\naddress the challenges caused by the coupled nonlinear interaction. For the\\ninfinitely coupled focusing nonlinear Schr\\\\\\\"odinger system when the mass is\\nslightly above the scattering threshold in \\\\cite{CGHY}, we show that scattering\\nis the only dynamical behavior of the solutions to the infinitely coupled\\nsystem.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:24:53Z\"}"}
