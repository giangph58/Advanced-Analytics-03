The system\\nis parametrized with a correlation parameter $\\\\rho$, which takes values in\\n$[-1,1]$ and governs the correlation between the branching mechanisms of the\\ntwo populations. While existence and uniqueness for this system were\\nestablished for $\\\\rho \\\\in [-1,1)$, weak uniqueness for the completely\\npositively correlated case of $\\\\rho = 1$ has been an open problem. In this\\npaper, we resolve this problem, establishing weak uniqueness for the\\ncorresponding system of stochastic partial differential equations. The proof\\nuses a new duality between the symbiotic branching model and the well-known\\nparabolic Anderson model. Furthermore, we use this duality to investigate the\\nlong-term behavior of the completely positively correlated symbiotic branching\\nmodel. We show that, under suitable initial conditions, after a long time, one\\nof the populations dies out. We treat the case of integrable initial conditions\\nand the case of bounded non-integrable initial conditions with well-defined\\nmean.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T07:35:42Z\"}"}
